	<brief_title>Informing Decisions Chronic Critical Illness : A Randomized Control Trial ( RCT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing use intensive care therapy age population create new medical syndrome - `` chronic critical illness '' - encompass multi-system derangement , recurrent complication , protracted/permanent dependence mechanical ventilation life-supports . Numbering &gt; 100,000 point time , chronically critically ill grow population old adult serious national health problem .

Descriptive research identify domains information important decision-making patients/families continuation treatment chronic phase critical illness , also reveal decision often make without information patient goal care context . In acute critical illness , schedule , structured meeting print informational aid effective Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) family , study test intervention inform support decision-making chronic critical illness . This study randomize , control , multi-center clinical trial intervention . Specific Aims : ( 1 ) To evaluate impact family- patient-focused outcome proactive program protocolized , interdisciplinary , informational support meeting lead palliative care physician , plus print informational aid , family chronically critically ill patient ; ( 2 ) To evaluate impact intervention utilization critical care resource chronically critically ill.
