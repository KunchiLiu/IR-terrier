	<brief_title>Topical Metronidazole Miconazole Co-formulated Vaginal Suppositories Preventing Vaginal Infections HIV-seronegative Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vaginal infection include bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) , vulvovaginal candidiasis ( VVC ) , Trichomonas ( T. ) vaginalis common associate increased risk HIV sexually transmit infection ( STIs ) multiple prospective study . Effective intervention prevention vaginal infection could substantially reduce risk HIV STIs woman . A recently complete trial demonstrate monthly periodic presumptive treatment ( PPT ) reduce vaginal infection promote Lactobacillus colonization . However , oral regimen metronidazole 2 gram plus fluconazole 150 mg sufficiently effective warrant move Phase III HIV/STI prevention trial use intervention . The identification efficacious regimen reduce vaginal infection crucial step towards development inexpensive , female-controlled , non-coitally dependent HIV/STI risk reduction intervention woman . There grow evidence high dos longer course may effective treatment vaginal infection single-dose therapy . The overall goal protocol conduct randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial test efficacy monthly PPT topical metronidazole 750 mg plus miconazole 200 mg ( co-formulated suppository ) versus match placebo suppository nightly five night month reduce rate BV VVC among HIV-seronegative woman . This regimen could produce sufficient reduction vaginal infection support use Phase III HIV STI prevention trial . The study participant include 234 woman sexually active ( great equal 4 episode heterosexual intercourse past month ) , HIV-seronegative , 18 45 year old , BV and/or VVC and/or T. vaginalis detect laboratory test screen visit . There two study arm . The treatment arm ( 117 subject ) receive PPT intravaginal metronidazole 750 mg plus miconazole 200 mg ( co-formulated suppository ) five consecutive night month . The placebo arm ( 117 subject ) receive PPT identical placebo intravaginal suppository five consecutive night month . Individual participant study one year .</detailed_description>
