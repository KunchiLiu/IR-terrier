	<brief_summary>Nutritional supplement like vitamin B6 magnesium demonstrate beneficial effect patient autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . The underlie theory effect specific metabolic pathway neuronal cell , e.g . methionine cycle , balance . Most study focus clinical outcome treatment . The present proposal examine effect different intermediate methionine cycle ( methylation transulfuration capacity ) , suggest play important role pathogenesis ASD . The design prospective pilot study , include 40 patient , age 2-6 yr , newly diagnose ASD . All participant receive supplement ( vitamin B6 , magnesium ; Kirkman formula ) placebo cross design . Metabolites blood urine measure prior end treatment different group . The result provide u information , link clinical outcome biological marker . Furthermore , study also potential shed light pathogenesis ASD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autism spectrum disorder ( ASDs ) neurodevelopment disorder characterize impairment social relatedness communication , repetitive behavior , abnormal movement pattern , sensory dysfunction affect child birth early month life , recognize parent 12 24 month age . Studies show diagnosis autism reliably make 2 3 year age , although diagnosis broader autistic spectrum less reliable age old child While genetic factor recognize important pathogenesis ASDs , metabolic biochemical factor consider play important role pathogenesis . Treatment direct impair core feature disorder . Pyridoxine ( vitamin B6 ) first use child diagnose `` autism syndrome '' speech language improvement observe child result large dos B6 . Magnesium add prevent possibility hyperactivity peripheral neuropathy , occur vitamin B6 take . An impairment methionine cycle transsulfuration previously report autistic child . Recent study autistic child suggest decreased capacity methylation contribute factor development clinical manifestation disease . Homocysteine remove either irreversible conversion cysteine ( transsulfuration ) remethylation methionine . There two separate remethylation reaction , catalyze betaine . The reaction remove homocysteine sensitive B vitamin status transsulfuration enzymes contain pyridoxal phosphate , methionine synthase contain cobalamin receives methyl group folic acid one-carbon pool . In addition , vitamin B6 require 100 enzymatic reaction , include production major neurotransmitter ( serotonin , dopamine , others ) glutathione ( need detoxification ) . A number study attempt assess effect vitamin B6-Magnesium ( Mg ) characteristic verbal communication , non-verbal communication , interpersonal skill , physiological function , individual autism . There 22 study vitamin B6 Magnesium ASD , include 11 double-blind , placebo-controlled study , make one studied treatment autism . Many study find child ASD benefit high-dose supplementation vitamin B6 Magnesium many area spectrum include language , eye contact behaviour . Twenty-one yield positive result , minor adverse effect report , In Cochrane Database Systematic Review study yield significant performance treatment placebo group performances follow B6 intervention measure social interaction , communication , compulsivity , impulsivity hyperactivity . However , none study evaluate effect vitamin B6 methionine cycle . In summary , propose study compare biochemical alteration key metabolic pathway , i.e . methionine cycle , suggest previous study play important role pathogenesis ASD , clinical parameter , treatment nutritional supplement . Therefore , result provide clinicians important information improvement optimization treatment patient ASD .</detailed_description>

Patients chronic illness know hormonal metabolic disease . Patients know genetic chromosomal syndrome . Inability parent give informed consent , travel clinic visit , administer study medication arrange completion rating scale . We exclude child concurrent medication ( e.g . antibiotic intercurrent illness , etc . ) record medication control presence final analysis . Furthermore , exclude child co morbid neurological disorder ( e.g . seizure disorder may present 25 % autistic patient ) . We record condition use predictor model understand relationship current management protocol .</criteria>
