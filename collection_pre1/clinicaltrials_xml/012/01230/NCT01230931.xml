	<brief_summary>Fractures acetabulum consider rare general community , quite common major metropolitan area tertiary care center . These fracture complex challenge injury successfully treat orthopaedic field . Extensile surgical exposure require access unique structure comprise cup hip joint . Large skin incision , significant soft tissue dissection , elevation periosteum muscle intact fractured fragment often required anatomic reduction acetabulum good outcome . Thus , many source intra-operative bleeding sum require strategy aim prevent bleed replace blood loss . Cell-saver transfusion allogeneic blood product replenish blood loss . The use cell-saver good solution , quite expensive . Trained perfusionists require cost $ 400 per hour . Disposable product also require patient . While blood loss great , often enough blood capture , process , available return transfusion . Allogeneic blood transfusion often routine . Appropriate blood often short supply . The cost processing , test , transfusion also high : minimum $ 260 per standard unit pack red blood cell . While risk disease transmission rare , exist serious consequence patient . Transmission include CMV ( common ) , Hepatitis C ( 1:1,600,000 ) , HIV ( 1:1,800,000 ) , bacteria ( 1:500,000 ) . Transfusion reaction common include febrile reaction ( 1:100 ) , allergic reaction ( 1:100 ) , hemolytic reaction ( less common ) , transfusion-related acute lung injury ( 1:5000 ) . Decreased operative time , aggressive electrocautery , ligation identifiable vessel , minimal soft tissue dissection stripping , topical agent gel foam , thrombin possible available . But still , significant blood loss persist . Over past decade , platelet gel product fibrin sealant develop provide another possible solution . There retrospective study arthroplasty literature indicate good hemostatic agent . There also literature general , oral maxillofacial , spine surgical field indicate topical agent decrease intra-operative blood loss . But large prospective , randomized study orthopedics , particularly traumatology , support use surgical hemostat . This study protocol use one surgical hemostat ( Vitagel , Stryker ) . The study prospective , randomize control trial evaluate type topical agent 's role hemostatic agent certain acetabular fracture type require non-extensile , posterior approach . Three fellowship-trained traumatologists involve : Drs . Milan Sen , Tim Achor , Josh Gary , Mark Prasarn , John Munz , Andrew Burgess . Dr. Ambrose assist analyze data statistical outcome . Purpose Project . The purpose study determine whether surgical hemostat minimize blood loss , need allogeneic blood transfusion associate risk , cost patient certain acetabular fracture require operative fixation via non-extensile Kocher-Langenbeck surgical approach . Since surgical hemostat topical agent like platelet gel product also link improve wound healing , secondary endpoint incidence wind dehiscence and/or infection . The investigator primary hypothesis topical hemostat result lower blood loss intraoperatively fewer unit perioperative blood product transfuse .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients identify upon admission Memorial Hermann-TMC , start January 1 , 2010 , fulfill follow inclusion criterion : 1 . Acetabular fracture deem require open reduction internal fixation one three principle attend surgeon . 2 . Fixation must require single non-extensile posterior approach ( Kocher-Langenbeck ) Posterior wall , Posterior column , certain simple transverse transverse associate posterior wall , T-type , posterior wall-posterior column fracture type 3 . Ages 18-65 4 . Patient family must consent research protocol Potential study candidate exclude base follow criterion 1 . Not meet aforementioned inclusion criterion 2 . Unstable hemoglobin level three day prior acetabular surgery ( i.e . bleed source ) 3 . Revision surgery 4 . Surgery occur two week post-injury 5 . History blood dyscrasia immunocompromised patient 6 . Patients medical condition require anticoagulation INR 1.5 7 . Obese patient ( BMI &gt; 35 ) 8 . Known ongoing infection ( local systemic ) 9 . Pregnant woman Consent Procedure : After admission , potential candidate recruit either resident , physician assistant , nurse practitioner . The research protocol present along risks benefit control treatment group . Both consent HIPAA documentation sign patient agreeable . Study Description . This prospective , randomize , control trial last one year minimum . Once consent obtain , patient randomize use seal envelope method . The patient know group he/she assign . The control group receive surgical hemostat blood draw necessary . The test group include use surgical hemostat . Both group receive standard intra- perioperative care ( i.e . cell save , blood transfusion need ) . At time enrollment , baseline information patient obtain questionnaire , include age , sex , BMI , medical co-morbidities , history alcohol , tobacco , drug . Randomization also account patient stratify pre-operative ASA , ISS , fracture type . A Data collection sheet include chart . It color flag . Nursing staff input follow data : 1 . Pre-operative hemoglobin level ( routine AM lab : generally 12AM-2AM STICU SIMU patient , 4AM-6AM floor patient ) 2 . Recovery room post-operative hemoglobin level 3 . Post-operative hemoglobin level ( routine AM lab : generally 12AM-2AM STICU SIMU patient , 4AM-6AM floor patient ) . For case end 5PM , hemoglobin level take fourth AM ensure full 72 hour monitor 4 . Post-operative transfusion requirement 72 hour OR nurse staff record intra-operative data , include : 1 . Intra-operative blood loss measure cell saver 2 . Intra-operative transfusion requirement 3 . Intra-operative complication Orthopaedic resident extend provider ( N.P . P.A . ) record evidence wound complication , include infection require antibiotic surgical debridement , dehiscence necrosis require additional treatment ( pack wound vac ) and/or surgery throughout hospital stay . Postoperative transfusion trigger follow : Hemoglobin &lt; 7 g/dL . Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL patient know cardiovascular comorbidities . Any hemoglobin level patient symptomatic physician deem necessary best interest patient transfuse blood . Examples include limit : - Hypotension shock . - Chest pain , palpitation , and/or shortness breath . - Lightheadness fatigue physical therapy . DVT chemoprophylaxis discontinue morning prior surgery resume 24 hour post operatively . Mechanical prophylaxis continue throughout tolerate . During surgery , Vitagel representative present aid nurse prepare sample . Autologous blood draw ( approximately 10cc ) perform anesthesiologist operating room . This sample pass nurse operating room , he/she centrifuge sample . The result plasma transfer sterile syringe deliver surgical field . The syringe autologous fibrinogen platelet ( 5cc ) assemble side-by-side sterile bovine thrombin collagen syringe ( 5cc ) , either surgical technician surgeon . The applicator simultaneously mix two sample spray surgical hemostat desire area . Sterile precaution maintain throughout , blood plasma leave operating room . The surgical hemostat apply first dissect musculature ( external rotators abductor ) exposure fracture second subcutaneous closure superficial iliotibial band gluteal fascia .</detailed_description>
