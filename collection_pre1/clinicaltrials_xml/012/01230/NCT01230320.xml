	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : The fabrication complete denture traditionally involve series complex technical procedure . Those procedure include two impression jaw , registration relationship upper teeth patient 's head usually two appointment tooth try-in . However , recent study question real need complex procedure . Simplified method could similar result compare conventional one , denture would deliver fast low cost . OBJECTIVES : This study aim compare effectiveness complete denture fabricate simplified conventional method . METHODS : Eighty edentulous patient request treatment maxillary mandibular complete denture public dental clinic inside University Sao Paulo - Ribeir√£o Preto Dental School randomly divide two group . Group S receive new denture fabricate simplified method , whereas Group C receive new denture accord conventional method . Participants complete questionnaire denture satisfaction oral health-related quality life , 3 6 month treatment . At time , specialist dental prosthesis evaluate quality new denture .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Complete edentulism consider important public health problem , particularly elderly . The prevalence edentulism among adult age 65 year still high several country , Canada ( 58 % ) , Saudi Arabia ( 31-46 % ) , United Kingdom ( 46 % ) , China ( 11 % ) India ( 19 % ) . Normative need maxillary mandibular complete denture Brazilian elder estimate 16 % 24 % , respectively . This way , epidemiologic aspect reinforces need cost-effective method treat patient complete denture . The conventional method fabrication complete denture demand comprehensive sequence clinical laboratorial procedure . Those method seem accept taught American Brazilian dental school . However , argue whether necessary obtainment adequate denture . Several approach describe attempt simplify clinical laboratorial stage , i.e . fabrication denture base directly cast obtain irreversible hydrocolloid impression make stock tray . Other simplified approach include fabrication without facebow transfer , alternative occlusal scheme ( i.e . lingualized occlusion ) duplication technique . A recent randomized clinical trial provide high level evidence efficacy simplify method . We run follow search strategy PubMed October 2010 : ( overdenture ( ( removable complete ) denture ) ) ( ( techni* fabricat* simpl* tradition* ) ( impression* occlus* ( facebow face-bow ) remount* adjust* ) ) ( ( ( randomize control trial [ pt ] ) OR ( control clinical trial [ pt ] ) OR ( randomize [ tiab ] ) OR ( placebo [ tiab ] ) OR ( drug therapy [ sh ] ) OR ( randomly [ tiab ] ) OR ( trial [ tiab ] ) OR ( group [ tiab ] ) ) AND ( human [ mh ] ) ) After read 470 title abstract , examine possible report randomize clinical trial , two study attempt evaluate simplify method denture fabrication find . One study compare simplified conventional method complete denture fabrication parallel arm trial . The difference method use second impression , facebow transfer remount conventional approach . No significant difference group find outcome variable test - denture quality patient satisfaction . The trial compare relative efficacy complete denture fabricate accord two occlusal concept , mean crossover design . A complex method employ facebow transfer recording condylar inclination , gothic arch trace bilateral balance occlusion . The simplified technique use facebow transfer , manual technique record centric occlusion canine guidance . Denture satisfaction influence fabrication method . The current evidence raise doubt relevance procedure involve fabrication complete denture . Despite high quality previously cite trial , study could use pragmatically approach test method public health patient . Moreover , data additional study could summarize future mean meta-analysis thus evidence would stronger . In summary , study may provide support either : 1 . Improve access edentulous patient complete denture treatment lower cost complexity ; 2 . Reinforce importance technical procedure denture fabrication . OBJECTIVES To compare complete denture fabricate simplify technique conventional prosthesis rehabilitation edentulous patient , 3 6 month wear . The null hypothesis mean value oral health-related quality life pair dentures fabricate simplified conventional denture similar . Similar secondary hypothesis consider secondary variable .</detailed_description>
