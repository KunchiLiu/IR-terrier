Clinical trial investigate preventive well therapeutic effect probiotic atopic dermatitis show inconsistent result . Systematic ( Cochrane ) review clinical trial ( treatment AD use probiotic ) conclude probiotic strain study date effective treatment AD ; however , great heterogeneity study since many different probiotic strain use . Because know strain specific capacity immunomodulatory effect , strain might great effect others .
