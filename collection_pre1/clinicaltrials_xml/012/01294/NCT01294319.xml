	<brief_summary>Background : - The adrenal gland , locate kidney , produce hormone call glucocorticoid mineralocorticoid . Glucocorticoids , especially hormone cortisol , act nearly cell body effect especially important body 's stress response . They maintain heart function , blood pressure , proper blood sugar level , help regulate body 's response infection injury . Mineralocorticoids help regulate salt water level body . - Blood level cortisol natural day-to-night pattern : high level occur morning lowest level occur night . This pattern regulate hormone ACTH , make pituitary gland , cause increase decreased cortisol level response level blood . Research show old men higher ACTH cortisol level young men , endurance-trained athlete different cortisol level sedentary individual . Researchers interested study difference cortisol level potential effect health . Objectives : - To compare cortisol level responses sedentary young men endurance-trained male athlete elderly men . Eligibility : - Healthy men 18 30 year age exercise less 1 hour week past 3 year . - Healthy men 18 30 year age regularly run 45 km ( 28 mile ) per week least 3 month . - Healthy men 65 80 year age exercise less 1 hour week past 3 year . Design : - Participants screen full medical history physical examination , well blood urine sample . - Participants collect saliva urine sample home , cortisol measurement . Saliva sample collect even 2 separate day , urine sample collect continuously 12-hour interval ( 7 AM 7 PM 7 PM 7 AM ) single 24-hour period . Participants provide baseline blood sample National Institutes Health drop saliva urine sample . - Participants four separate evening/overnight test National Institutes Health . At test , participant take study drug look-alike capsule block effect glucocorticoid , mineralocorticoid , glucocorticoid mineralocorticoid , neither . Blood , saliva , urine sample collect regularly 7 PM 7 AM next morning . - Participants final clinic test take dexamethasone late evening ( 11 PM midnight ) visit National Institutes Health 8 AM next morning provide blood sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adrenocorticotropin ( ACTH ) secretion normally exquisitely regulate endogenous stimulation corticotrophin-releasing hormone ( CRH ) negative feedback inhibition cortisol , result circadian rhythm cortisol . Recent evidence suggest old men young men endurance-trained athlete reduce sensitivity negative feedback , perhaps increase basal level cortisol ACTH . To investigate possibility , propose examine multiple aspect hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis young endurance train sedentary men , old sedentary men . Subjects collect saliva two evening additional testing , even collect urine twelve hour , cortisol measurement . Blood sample collect evaluate function white blood cell responses dexamethasone . We also assess ACTH cortisol response medication reduce negative inhibition ACTH . This test occur even include administration glucocorticoid antagonist mifepristone , mineralocorticoid antagonist spironolactone , and/or look-alike tablet , four occasion .</detailed_description>
