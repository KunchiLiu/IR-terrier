	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose TLR8 agonist VTX-2337 pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride treat patient recurrent persistent ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , peritoneal cavity cancer . Biological therapy , TLR8 agonist VTX-2337 , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving TLR8 agonist VTX-2337 together pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride paclitaxel may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerated dos ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) VTX-2337 administer combination pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( PLD ; Doxil , Lipodox™ ) 40 mg/m2 Regimen 1 administer combination weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 Regimen 2 , associate DLTs base adverse event occur cycle 1 combination woman recurrent persistent , epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . II . To examine tolerability combination MTD VTX-2337 assess combination PLD 40 mg/m2 PLD 50 mg/m2 Regimen 1 combination weekly paclitaxel Regimen 2 . III . To determine recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) VTX-2337 combination PLD Regimen 1 combination weekly paclitaxel Regimen 2 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess biological effect ( immune activation ) VTX-2337 combination PLD Regimen 1 combination weekly paclitaxel Regimen 2 . II . To assess pharmacokinetics patient receive VTX-2337 combination PLD Regimen 1 combination weekly paclitaxel Regimen 2 . III . To assess tolerability ( include CTCAE v4 Grade 3/4 allergic reaction ) weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 administer without corticosteroid premedication ( Regimen 2 ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess anti-tumor activity VTX-2337 administer concomitantly PLD Regimen 1 administer concomitantly weekly paclitaxel Regimen 2 patient recurrent persistent epithelial ovarian fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . II . To assess effect TLR8 polymorphisms biological ( immune ) clinical effect VTX-2337 combination PLD Regimen 1 combination weekly paclitaxel Regimen 2 . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study . Patients receive TLR8 agonist VTX-2337 subcutaneously ( SC ) day 3 , 10 , 17 pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 60 minute day 1 TLR8 agonist VTX-2337 subcutaneously day 1 , 8 , 15 paclitaxel IV 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect periodically course 1 2 pharmacokinetic , pharmacogenomic , research study . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
