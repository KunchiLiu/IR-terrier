	<brief_summary>Human study Chinese liquor sparse . The investigator hypothesize short-term Chinese Tea-flavor liquor ( TFL ) consumption may beneficial inflammation biomarkers CVD risk factor . Guizhou Meijiao Liquor ( GML ) traditional Chinese liquor , ferment sorghum , corn , sticky rice , wheat rice , TFL novel Chinese liquor ferment 5 grain plus green tea . Forty-five volunteer ( 23 male , 22 female ) select participate parallel randomized trial drink 30 mL two kind Chinese liquor : TFL GML respectively meal every day 28 day . Serums volunteer collect analyze serum lipid , inflammation biomarkers CVD risk factor . TFL could significantly decrease systolic blood pressure male , increase diastolic blood pressure female . TFL could also decrease blood lipid volunteer , especially female . Both liquor significantly decrease serum uric acid glucose male female . The effect two liquor inflammation biomarkers complicate need research work . TFL may possess beneficial effect CVD risk factor GML probably special fermentation product green tea grain .</brief_summary>
