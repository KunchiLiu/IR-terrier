	<brief_title>Comparative Efficacy Dutasteride Plus Tamulosin With Lifestyle Advice Versus Watchful Waiting Plus Lifestyle Advice Management Treatment naïve Men With Moderately Symptomatic Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Prostate Enlargement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This European , multicentre , randomise , open-label , parallel group study . The aim study investigate whether Dutasteride plus Tamulson treatment lifestyle advice effective watchful wait treatment plus lifestyle advice plus step-up therapy tamsulosin improvement symptom Acte Urinary Retention ( AUR ) BPH-related prostatic surgery , old men ( ≥50 yrs ) , moderate symptom BPH ( IPSS 8-19 ) , enlarge prostate ( ≥30cc ) Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) ≥1.5ng/mL . Data participate centre pool prior analysis . Investigative centre pool priori cluster base geographic location ; cluster may use analysis adjust site effect . Clusters define investigative centre identify randomisation complete . Subjects screen inclusion study eligible subject randomise investigative centre . Subjects allocate one two treatment group , accord pre-determined randomisation schedule ( 1:1 ratio ) : - Dutasteride plus tamsulosin daily plus lifestyle advice . - Watchful wait plus lifestyle advice . Escalation tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily visit Week 4 IPSS measurement show improvement worsen baseline . At study visit , IPSS great baseline value subject , tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily initiate . If tamsulosin initiate , continue remainder study unless subject elect withdraw study . Initiation tamsulosin record electronic case report form ( eCRF . ) Subjects self-administer study medication daily 104 week , ( 100 week tamsulosin ) . Subjects return clinic 4 week post-randomisation 13-week interval post-randomisation 2-year treatment period ( i.e . 4 , 13 , 26 , 39 , 52 , 65 , 78 , 91 104 week ) assessment list Appendix 1 Time Events Schedule . Approximately 760 , treatment naive men symptomatic BPH randomise study order achieve least 592 evaluable subject . 380 Dutasteride plus tamsulosin lifestyle advice arm 380 watchful wait plus lifestyle advice arm . Treatment naïve define man recently diagnose BPH receive prescribed therapeutic treatment . For example , medicine 5 α-reductase inhibitor ( 5-ARIs ) invasive procedure transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) prescribe directly treat BPH symptom consider therapeutic treatment . As per entry criterion , phytotherapy allow unless perform less two week prior screen visit . The anticipated recruitment period approximately 6 month . The study conduct approximately 8 country within Europe .</detailed_description>
