	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize individual difference exist resting-state cortical attention , control , sensory , emotion network prior noise exposure difference predispose development bothersome tinnitus . Furthermore , investigator hypothesize change functional connectivity vulnerable system noise exposure responsible tinnitus . The propose study use case-control cohort study design . Cases soldier develop tinnitus control . This first prospective study tinnitus provide important information neurobiology tinnitus . If cortical neural network etiology bothersome tinnitus confirm , astound , powerful , paradigm shift model diagnosis , prevention , importantly , treatment tinnitus . Furthermore , battery neurocognitive test identify soldier risk development tinnitus appropriate primary prevention strategy introduce . There three Specific Aims project . Specific Aim 1 . To determine soldier develop tinnitus display pre-deployment difference set physical , functional , cognitive , vulnerability , perpetuate factor , pre-deployment neurocognitive score , neuroimaging feature compare soldier develop tinnitus ( `` control group '' ) . Specific Aim 2 . To determine particular score neurocognitive test neuroimaging feature functional/structural connectivity network associate development tinnitus . Specific Aim 3 . To identify set pre-deployment physical , functional , cognitive , vulnerability , perpetuate factor , neurocognitive response , neuroimaging feature associate development tinnitus . The investigator plan recruit 200 soldier , age 18 30 year hearing loss tinnitus never deploy military theater . The soldier participant undergo variety test deployment , include hear test , neurocognitive test ( i.e. , brain function test ) , variety novel radiologic image study brain . One novel radiologic image study functional connectivity Magnetic Resonance Imaging , proven methodology monitor change brain activity connection base blood flow different brain area level consumption oxygen . This information use describe condition important neural network responsible thing attention , mood , sensation , vision , hearing , introspection self-contemplation .</brief_summary>
