	<brief_title>MK2206 Erlotinib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Progressed After Previous Response Erlotinib Hydrochloride Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy ( primary endpoint disease control 12 week ) tolerability combination MK2206 plus erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) previously erlotinib-treated patient recurrent progressive advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) whose tumor either epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutate EGFR wild-type . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free survival previously erlotinib-treated patient NSCLC treat MK2206 plus erlotinib . II . To determine overall survival previously erlotinib-treated patient NSCLC treat MK2206 plus erlotinib . III . To assess toxicity experience previously erlotinib-treated patient NSCLC treat MK2206 plus erlotinib . IV . To perform correlative analysis tumor biomarkers assess , preliminary manner , association tumor mutation and/or abnormality clinical outcome previously erlotinib-treated patient NSCLC treat MK2206 plus erlotinib . OUTLINE : Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) every day ( QOD ) 28-day course , erlotinib hydrochloride PO daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 12 week one year annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
