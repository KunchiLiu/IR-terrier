	<detailed_description>Parent-Child Interaction Therapy ( PCIT ) empirically support behavioral parent train program reduce aggressive behavior young child reduce future rate child physical abuse . Prior research find adapted version PCIT develop specifically violent parent child welfare system reduce future child physical abuse recurrence rate 49 % 19 % . OUHSC/CCAN researcher , prior ongoing study , find benefit PCIT durable time generalize across setting across child family . Culturally-specific adaptation PCIT adaptation older abused child abusive parent develop . A number blue-ribbon panel recommend PCIT widespread dissemination child abuse prevention intervention service system , uptake PCIT limit . One reason traditional PCIT practitioner training model easily replicable field setting . PCIT historically teach University-based training program ( graduate program , internship , etc . ) include several month co-therapy mentor trainer work directly trainee live session . In contrast , give difficulty conduct co-therapy mentoring field setting , train widespread implementation generally involved initial training model follow phone consultation . OUHSC/CCAN researcher pilot- feasibility test system use internet-based telemedicine technology deliver live , mentor PCIT training . OUHSC/CCAN researcher pilot Remote Real-Time ( RRT ) training site Utah , Seattle , Alaska , Oregon , Oklahoma . Feasibility appear excellent , approach well receive . Moreover , RRT implementation reveal misapplication model go unaddressed phone consultation . This research project make use plan , fund PCIT start-up implementation 20-24 agency sit Washington Oklahoma . Study participant include agency practitioner engage implement PCIT model family receive PCIT service community agency . Using multilevel interrupt time series randomize design ; study compare RRT implementation approach standard phone consultation ( PC ) . Outcomes include practitioner fidelity competency implement PCIT , practitioner acceptance satisfaction PCIT , family outcome parental skill acquisition , parent satisfaction , child aggressive oppositional behavior , rate future child welfare abuse report . A mediational model propose difference client outcomes mediate improved practitioner fidelity competency . Cost effectiveness practitioner response implementation approach examine . The study thus inform strategy facilitate widespread dissemination implementation fidelity evidence-based PCIT model , thereby make model available broad range agency practitioner work at-risk family .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>A major inclusion criterion agency exist plan financial support PCIT implementation study 's resource fund phase one didactic train clinical implementation . The propose agency exist funding , include demonstration grant , Children 's Justice grant funding , state contract , federal implementation funding , Indian Health Services funding , SAMHSA fund specifically support PCIT implementation . However without current project , none agency site propose study would use RRT assess therapist fidelity ; study thus provide quality assurance mechanism would unavailable otherwise . The agency review agree set agency inclusion criterion study participation : The agency commit develop PCIT program , simply train staff . There commitment leadership program 's longterm sustainability , include sustain program staff turnover . The agency identify minimum three staff PCIT training ( two staff member acceptable small agency three child service provider ) , least one supervisor . Licensed mental health practitioner staff Master 's degree high strongly prefer , although exception may make case agency Master 's level staff . ( For example , agency conduct culturally relevant program minority rural population always able employ license mental health provider staff . Because RRT may especially salient agency , agency exclude study . ) The agency commit providing resource staff availability complete basic PCIT training package , standard PC consultation , staff participation approximately six month RRT training . The agency process develop physical infrastructure deliver PCIT . Physical infrastructure include PCIT room sound equipment , bugintheear equipment , video record equipment . The agency need dedicate broadband internet line RRT equipment . The agency able demonstrate develop referral network sufficient provide enough PCIT case therapist develop mastery . This include referral commitment support local child welfare office , court , school , forth . If agency plan serve child welfare parent whose child foster care , imperative firm commitment transportation plan . Preliminary work may necessary gain cooperation child welfare court insure service plan court order consistent PCIT ( i.e . allow joint parentchild session ) . The agency agree basic PCIT training meet OUHSC training guideline ( describe later ) . If client consent participate , agency agrees archive video recording PCIT session basic PCIT clinical measure client . The agency state agrees provide OUHSC child welfare outcome data . In event agency 's PCIT startup plan require begin PCIT service prior start study , commence archive session client data early session fidelity competency client outcomes track . Standard PC consultation provide study begin . Session clientlevel data routinely collect part PCIT implementation , guide clinical intervention assure quality service . However , data use research purpose unless therapist client provide informed consent use . The study retain right involuntarily remove agency therapist study PCIT implementation data collection agency prove infeasible .</criteria>
