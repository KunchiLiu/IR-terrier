	<brief_summary>Background : - Many people traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) low level physical fitness . Low physical fitness cause severe fatigue reduces ability perform routine daily activity , may also cause increased depression , anxiety , sadness . Aerobic exercise , treadmill walk running , improve physical fitness people may also decrease fatigue improve mood . However , information need determine exercise improve condition people TBI . Objectives : - To examine effect aerobic treadmill walk exercise program physical fitness , fatigue , mood people TBI . Eligibility : - Individuals 21 45 year age nonpenetrating traumatic brain injury least 6 month participate ; able understand oral write English language , give informed consent sign consent form ; physically inactive ( include activity relate job recreation ) ; able stand walk treadmill safely without help . Design : - This study require 4 test visit 36 exercise visit 14 week . - The first third test visit last 4 hour second final testing visit take 2 hour . - Testing visit consist medical history physical examination , completion questionnaire ( fatigue , daily physical activity , sleep quality , mood , overall quality life ) , test think treadmill exercise test . - Participants treadmill exercise train 3 day per week 12 week . Each session include check-in , warm-up , treadmill walk train heart rate , cool-down . Thirty-two session last 1 hour , four session include questionnaire fill last one-and-a-half hour . - After complete exercise training program , participant final test visit complete questionnaire ( fatigue , daily physical activity , sleep quality , mood , overall quality life ) , test think treadmill exercise test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The broad objective exploratory project inform clinical study trial use aerobic exercise training ( AET ) intervention improve cardiorespiratory fitness patient traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . AET-induced adaptation cardiorespiratory fitness fatigue severity characterize , time-course change mood reactivity determine . We hypothesize 1 ) AET improve cardiorespiratory fitness fatigue severity 2 ) mood first worsen response AET mood reactivity decrease point intervention , 3 ) AET impair overall cognitive performance , specific cognitive performance area attention concentration improve AET . Study Population Thirty-six adult subject clinical diagnosis non-penetrating TBI ( mild , moderate , severe ) enrol . Subjects recruit NIH , affiliate hospitals/clinics , community . Design This pilot study pre-experimental , test-intervention-retest design . Cardiorespiratory fitness , fatigue severity , cognitive performance , change mood reactivity measure baseline . The subject participate 12-week treadmill exercise training intervention protocol know improve cardiorespiratory fitness general population . Following 12 week AET , cardiorespiratory fitness , fatigue severity , cognitive performance retested compare baseline . Changes mood reactivity assess monthly . Outcome Measures AET-induced change cardiorespiratory fitness measure peak oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) primary outcome measure measure pulmonary gas exchange analysis treadmill exercise tolerance test . A submaximal , continuous work rate test also use measure ability cardiorespiratory system meet energy demand work time ( VO2 on-kinetics ) . The Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ) principal measurement tool fatigue outcome variable . FSS score interpret relation information Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form ( MOS-36SF ) , Becks Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) , International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) Profile Mood States Short Form ( POMS-SF ) . Cognitive performance test interpreted compare norm Finger Tapping Test ( FTT ) , Trail Making Test ( TMT ) Repeatable Battery Assessment Neuropsychological Status ( RBANS ) . Change mood reactivity measure difference POMS-SF score 30 minute recovery . The outcome variable time-course related change mood reactivity week onset significant improvement mood reactivity .</detailed_description>
