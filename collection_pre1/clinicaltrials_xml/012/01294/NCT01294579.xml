	<brief_summary>The purpose phase II open label study evaluate safety efficacy ofatumumab bendamustine follow maintenance ofatumumab subject indolent B-NHL relapse Rituximab treatment . A maximum 53 subject least 18 year old Small lymphocytic , lymphoplasmacytic , marginal zone lymphoma , follicular lymphoma ; Grades 1 , 2 3a , enrol ( 34 Stage 1 19 Stage 2 ) . Subjects Rituximab-sensitive disease , define Partial Remission ( PR ) Complete Remission ( CR ) last rituximab-containing therapy last least 6 month follow completion therapy subject relapse disease progression follow response prior rituximab-based therapy Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance status 0 1 2 . During induction phase , ofatumumab 1000 mg IV day 1 cycle ( cycle 1-6 ) follow Bendamustine 90 mg/m2 IV day 1 , 2 cycle ( cycle 1-6 ) .During maintenance phase , subject PR CR induction phase receive ofatumumab 1000 mg IV every 2 month 2 year .</brief_summary>
