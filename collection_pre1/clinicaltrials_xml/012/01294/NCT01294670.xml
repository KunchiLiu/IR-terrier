	<criteria>Phase I Component : Histologic confirmation relapsed/refractory solid tumor , include tumor central nervous system fail respond standard therapy , progress despite standard therapy , standard therapy exist . Patients diffuse pontine glioma require histologic confirmation disease , eligible radiologic confirmation . Phase II Component : population restrict relapsed/refractory sarcomas Patient must 421 year age time study enrollment . Efforts make enroll patient &lt; 13 year age adequate information biologic effect agent young patient obtain . Patient must Karnofsky &gt; = 60 % patient &gt; 10 year age ; Lansky Play Scale &gt; = 60 child &lt; = 10 year age Patient must life expectancy &gt; 8 week . There limit number prior treatment regimen provide performance status life expectancy meet criterion . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1000 / mcL Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL ( transfusion permit ) Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL qualification ( transfusion permit ) Coagulation Prothrombin Time INR ≤ 1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min patient creatinine level &gt; 1.5x institutional ULN . calculate creatinine clearance Creatinine clearance calculate per institutional standard . Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Patient 's n't meet criterion must Direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) Alkaline Phosphatase ( liver fraction ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN . If AST ALT &gt; 2.5 x ULN , liver fraction Alkaline Phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN Phase I component : Patients may measurable nonmeasurable disease . Phase II component : Patients may measurable disease . Patient must persistent toxicity prior therapy &gt; = Grade 2 exception hematologic index ( i.e . hemoglobin , WBC , ANC , ALC ) . For female childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test must document within 72 hour receive first dose vorinostat . Patient , patient 's legal representative , voluntarily agree participate give write informed consent . Female patient childbearing potential must willing use 2 adequate barrier method contraception prevent pregnancy agree abstain heterosexual activity throughout study , start visit 1 . Male patient must agree use adequate method contraception duration study . Prior Therapy : Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy prior enter study . Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : At least 2 week must elapse since administration previous therapy . Six week must elapse since administration nitrosoureas mitomycin C. Seven day must elapse since administration GCSF and/or GMCSF . Biologic agent : At least 14 day must elapse since completion therapy biologic agent monoclonal antibody . Seven day must elapse since last dose retinoids . Radiation therapy ( XRT ) : &gt; = 2 week must elapse local XRT ( small port ) ; &gt; = 6 month must elapse prior radiation &gt; = 50 % pelvis substantial bone marrow irradiation , include total body irradiation . Patient must able swallow capsule . Patient must available archival/pretreatment block fresh tumor biopsy molecular profiling perform . A patient meeting follow criterion eligible participate study : Patients currently participate participate study investigational compound device within 4 week initial dose study drug . Patients prior history treatment HDAC inhibitor ( e.g . SNDX275/entinostat , LAQ824 , LBH589 , PXD101/belinostat , etc ) . Patients receive Valproic acid exclude study . Patients non CNS primary tumor know brain metastasis symptomatic CNS disease ( e.g . cranial nerve abnormality ) without cytologic abnormality CSF exclude clinical trial poor prognosis know propensity development progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients metastatic CNS tumor exclude enrollment study phase I component . Patients undergone prior autologous stem cell transplantation allogeneic transplantation . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness circumstance could limit compliance study requirement include , limited : ongoing active bacterial fungal infection , acute chronic graft versus host disease , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation . Patients pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive within project duration study . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother vorinostat , lactate patient exclude study . Patients know Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) positive . Patients know hypersensitivity component study drug analog . Patients symptomatic ascites pleural effusion . A patient clinically stable follow treatment condition eligible . Patients time sign informed consent , regular user illicit drug , substance abuser recent history drug alcohol abuse . Patients known history Hepatitis B C. Patients history gastrointestinal surgery procedure might opinion investigator , interfere absorption swallow study drug . Patients unable take tolerate oral medication continuous basis . Patients history prior malignancy undergone potentially curative therapy evidence disease five year patient , deem low risk recurrence his/her treat physician permit enroll .</criteria>
