	<brief_summary>This investigation gather information procedure call sphenopalatine ganglion ( SPG ) stimulation , appropriateness , safety , efficacy treatment suffer migraine headache may result chronic severe disability . The SPG small collection nerve cell head , locate near base nose either side . Participation involve surgical implantation electrode ( small electrical conductor ) sphenopalatine ganglion . The electrode connect stimulator enable treatment migraine headache . Tiny electrical current deliver stimulator device internal pulse generator implant area top chest , stop migraine headache . The implant system control wireless remote provide implant procedure . Participation record headache diary throughout study , last approximately 8½ month , yearly visit annually five year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This application propose clinical study electrical stimulation sphenopalatine ganglion ( SPG ) treatment three individual episodic migraine headache . The present study aim obtain pilot data guide future control trial treatment modality . The study population include individual suffer episodic migraine headache chronic severe disability , demonstrate Migraine Disability Assessment Questionnaire ( Lipton , 2000 ) Headache Impact Test short form ( HIT-6™ ) ( Kosinski , 2003 ) . The treatment involve implantation electrode SPG . The electrode connect subcutaneously infraclavicular stimulator ( PrimeAdvanced™ 37702 Multi-program Neurostimulator System , Medtronic Inc. , Minneapolis MN ) . Proper electrode placement verify use anatomic physiologic technique . Participants receive Medtronic Model 3389 3387 lead , Medtronic subcompact lead Model 3776-45 , 3776-60 , 3776-75 . Stimulation deliver range frequency 20 130 Hz , pulse width 60 450 μsec , titrate voltage . The voltage use chronic stimulation may range pulse generator maximum 10.5 volt anticipate generally 3 volt , keep 30 µcoulomb/cm² charge density safety limit , threshold adverse stimulation-related effect . The minimum number contact quadripolar lead activate necessary produce response . The Prime Advanced neurostimulator use study allows clinician set stimulation parameter include maximum allowable amplitude . It responsibility assure appropriate stimulation parameter use result appropriate electrical exposure charge density ) 30 µC/cm2/phase limit . As do commercially available neurostimulators , study , utilize chart present Figures 1 2 assist selection program parameter , program maintain software control within neurostimulator . For exploratory study 3 patient , maximum electrical stimulating parameter , result electrical exposure ( e.g. , charge density ) , determine use method describe . It responsibility assure safe stimulation parameter use time maximum setting exceed safety limit . Our plan begin lead 3776 possible , require extra extension , would use 3387 3389 clinically indicate . The propose study physician-sponsored research investigation three patient , attention stimulation parameter much great expect commercially release product . It responsibility within investigational study insure select stimulation parameter exceed safety limit 30μC/cm2/phase . Patients participate study able low stimulation amplitude , thereby keep stimulation parameter BELOW clinician set maximum . The program available accessible patient maintain previously describe parameter set limitation . Thus , program Implantable Programmable Generator ( IPG ) keep three patient stimulate outside set safe parameter . The primary outcome measure assess efficacy migraine treatment subject report daily diary noting frequency intensity headache . During investigation obtain preliminary control data safety efficacy SPG stimulation migraine treatment .</detailed_description>
