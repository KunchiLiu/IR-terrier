	<brief_summary>This clinical trial investigate ability plant exosomes effectively deliver curcumin normal colon tissue colon tumor . Curcumin yellow pigment turmeric , natural product diverse biological activity . Exosomes small endosome-derived vesicle ( 50-100 nanometer [ nm ] size ) . Previous clinical trial conduct oral curcumin demonstrate limited bioavailability even high dos 8-12 gram per day . This trial plan address problem curcumin delivery use plant exosomes deliver drug colon tumor normal colon tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Investigating Ability Plant Exosomes Deliver Curcumin Normal Colon Cancer Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Curcumin constituent spice turmeric , one primary ingredient curry powder . Curcumin show interfere colon carcinogenesis variety chemical genetic rodent model . It also show strong inhibitory effect growth colon cancer cell line . There considerable evidence effect curcumin mediate change signal transduction . There extensive body work show effect several signal pathway , include beta-catenin NF-ÎºB pathway . Although curcumin view ideal chemopreventative agent colon cancer many year , application impede important issue drug delivery bioavailability report clinical trial compound . Work James Graham Brown Cancer Center publish recently suggest use exosomes delivery vehicle lead overcome major obstacle use curcumin anti-inflammatory agent , include increase stability , solubility , bioavailability curcumin . The work extend define resource supply large quantity exosomes maximum bind capacity curcumin . Emerging data indicate exosomes derive many fruit release exosome-like particle , strongly bind many hydrophobic drug include curcumin , take intestine cell well immune cell intestine . These result suggest fruit-derived exosomes potentially used delivery vehicle treatment intestinal disease . Moreover , fruit exosomes curcumin generate side-effects since consume human daily . In clinical trial , effect exosomally deliver curcumin immune modulation , cellular metabolism , phospholipid profile normal malignant colon cell subject undergoing surgery newly diagnose colon cancer characterize . In selected subject , effect exosomally deliver curcumin production cytokine , change immune cell , glucose metabolism administration 13C-glucose prior surgical resection also characterize .</detailed_description>
