	<brief_summary>Background : - Pancreatic cancer difficult treat time case diagnose , tumor large remove surgically . Standard intravenous chemotherapy may shrink tumor , even chemotherapy 25 percent patient live 1 year follow diagnosis . Several preliminary study show safe give chemotherapy directly pancreas area tumor , give gemcitabine long period increase amount drug available tumor . Researchers interested study whether give approve pancreatic cancer chemotherapy drug gemcitabine directly pancreas area cancer slow rate infusion safe effective treatment . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness administer gemcitabine directly pancreatic tumor slow rate infusion . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose pancreatic cancer currently large remove surgically yet spread organ . Design : - Participants screen full medical history physical examination , blood urine test , image study . - Participants undergo pancreatic angiography embolization , catheter thread blood vessel near pancreas contrast dye use show blood vessel supply tumor . These blood vessel surgically close . - After embolization , gemcitabine give infusion area around tumor 24 hour . - Participants return clinical center every 2 week first infusion additional infusion gemcitabine , use procedure . Participants monitor frequent blood test image study . - Two week fourth treatment ( course 1 ) , participant image study , physical examination , blood test . If tumor shrinking , participant two course treatment ( eight infusion gemcitabine ) . - Participants followup visit every 3 month 2 year follow last treatment every 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regional Chemotherapy Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer : RECLAP Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Pancreatic cancer fourth lead cause cancer death United States . - Surgery offer chance cure ; however , less 20 % patient consider resectable initial presentation . - A common reason classify unresectable loco-regional advanced disease . - Several phase I study regional administration chemotherapy proven safe . - The main advantage pancreatic cancer target arterial perfusion Gemcitabine achievement high local bio-available active drug level tumor bed . - The RECLAP trial phase I trial offer highly selective 24-hour intra-arterial administration Gemcitabine via subcutaneous port patient unresectable locally-advanced pancreatic cancer . Objectives : Primary Objective : - To evaluate feasibility toxicity intra-arterial gemcitabine therapy ( DLT ) . - To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate response rate use RECIST , PET , MRI CT perfusion criterion ( EASL ) - To determine progression free overall survival . - To evaluate conversion rate unresectable borderline resectable potentially resectable pancreatic cancer . - To determine progression-free overall survival . - To analyze potential selection criterion use future study patient present marginally unresectable unresectable locally-advanced pancreatic cancer might benefit approach . Eligibility : - Unresectable locally-advanced pancreatic cancer . - 18 year old great ECOG 0-2 - Laboratory physical examination parameter within acceptable limit standard practice guideline prior surgery chemotherapy . - No extra-pancreatic disease except regional lymph node . Design : - This dose escalation phase-I study . - Patients consider unresectable due locally-advanced pancreatic cancer receive selective arterial perfusion gemcitabine 24 hour via subcutaneous indwell port . - Treatment give Days 1 14 . One cycle = 4 week six cycle . - Three six patient enrol per dose cohort . - 18 36 patient 7 cohort accrue plus 6 patient MTD 36 month . Patients evaluate every 2 cycle ( 8 week ) . Upon progression patient take study . If PD , patient continue 6 cycle . - Chemotherapy na ( SqrRoot ) patient patient receive previously chemotherapy include gemcitabine allow , mode administration well bioavailability , offer potential good biological effect less systemic toxicity profile .</detailed_description>
