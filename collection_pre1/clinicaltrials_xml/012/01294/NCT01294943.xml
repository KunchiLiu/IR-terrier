Patients fully partially dependent care patient make oral hygiene alone dependent another individual , hospital staff member health . Exclusion criterion base condition dependency patient , intubation period 48 hour one refuse participate research . Patients first evaluated dentist , doctor nursing , together decide inclusion patient study base criterion seriousness patient APACHE . The assessment follow clinical criterion presence absence tongue biofilm ( Adachi 2005 ) , collection swab biofilm lingual perform culture sensitivity . These assessment take place twice within five day , hold first fifth day . During period patient participate GE hygienic tongue use tongue cleaner ( Tepe Â® ) standardize oral hygiene care nurse team previously coach dentist . CG patient receive standard oral hygiene care spatula gauze soak mouthwash tongue use tongue cleaner . For assessment plaque tongue sample qualitative material culture sensitivity attend three calibrated dentist .
