	<brief_summary>This research trial study prognostic predictive marker patient early stage non-small cell lung cancer receive chemotherapy . Prognostic marker patient tumor factor predict patient survival independent treatment . Predictive marker factor may influence predict outcome treatment term either response survival benefit . Collecting store sample tissue patient cancer study laboratory may help doctor learn cancer identify biomarkers related cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers Predicting Response Patients With Early-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Previously Treated With Adjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate potential prognostic predictive marker patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy early stage non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . II . To perform cross-validation analysis predictive value cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B ( p27 ) , excision repair cross-complementation group 1 ( ERCC1 ) , beta-tubulin B-cell lymphoma 2 ( BCL2 ) -associated X protein ( BAX ) . III . To perform cross-validation analysis prognostic value mucin breast cancer ( BRCA ) 1 expression . IV . To perform pooled analysis prognostic impact p53 protein expression immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , tumor protein p53 ( p53 ) mutation , ras mutation epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation , Fas cell surface death receptor ( Fas ) /Fas ligand ( FasL ) expression IHC . V. Validation 15-gene prognostic predictive messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) signature Lung Adjuvant Cisplatin Evaluation ( LACE ) -Bio formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tumor sample . VI . Exploratory evaluation prognostic predictive value know potential oncogenic mutation use LACE-Bio FFPE . VII . Exploratory evaluation prognostic predictive value gene copy variation use LACE-Bio FFPE tumor sample . VIII . Exploratory identification evaluation prognostic predictive value novel genomic aberration discover Next Generation Sequencing LACE-Bio tumor sample . OUTLINE : Previously collect tissue sample analyze IHC .</detailed_description>
