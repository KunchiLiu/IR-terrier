	<brief_summary>Patients operate hip fracture older several condition negative influence perioperative postoperative prognosis . Hip fracture also painful , stressful physiology patient . Many old patient receive little fluid intake . They often diuretic therapy , even worsen dehydration/hypovolemia . Some patient wait several day surgery . Several study show high degree complication increase mortality patient group . Early preoperative optimization improve outcome . The available method optimization patient complicate time consuming . The investigator wish study try new approach find patient still dehydrate come operation ward . The aim measure color density urine well register variability plethysmographic curve spinal anaesthesia . These result compare circulatory instability surgery well postoperative complication .</brief_summary>
