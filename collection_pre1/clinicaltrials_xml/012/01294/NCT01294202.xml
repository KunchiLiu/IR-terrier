	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate investigational drug call AT13387 active Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor ( GIST ) resistant treatment , understand safety AT13387 . Most subject study receive AT13387 along another drug call imatinib ( Gleevec ) . Imatinib standard ( approve ) drug treat patient GIST . Some patient may receive AT13387 . As result , shall begin understand effect AT13387 give combine imatinib.We shall also find side-effects AT13387 , body break ( metabolizes ) AT13387 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Safety Efficacy AT13387 , Alone Combination With Imatinib , Patients With GIST</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist 3 part : Part 1 dose escalation phase , Part 2 dose expansion phase Part 3 either dose expansion phase randomise phase half patient receive AT13387 monotherapy half continue receive AT13387 combination imatinib . All patient receive AT13387 give intravenous infusion Days 1 , 8 , 15 28-day cycle . Most patient also receive imatinib 400 mg mouth every day . Patients tumour image baseline , 2 , 4 6 month , 2 month interval cycle 12 , 3-monthly thereafter . Blood sample take measure plasma drug level AT13387 give combination imatinib</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability understand risk study provide sign date informed consent authorization use protect health information ( accordance national local subject privacy regulation ) . Age 18 year old . Unresectable and/or metastatic malignant GIST objective progression disease follow treatment maximum 3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) include imatinib . To clarify , number TKIs maximum three agent , include imatinib criterion entry , number prior course TKI treatment . Measurable disease . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Negative blood urine pregnancy test ( within 7 day prior commence treatment ) , document evidence surgical sterility , natural treatmentinduced postmenopausal status last menses &gt; 1 year ago . Willing provide tissue block unstained slide archive tumour central pathology review genotyping , full pathology report result genotyping previous tumour sample , willing undergo new tumour biopsy central pathology review genotyping screen period study ( prior dosing ) Pregnancy lactation ( woman childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior commence treatment ) . Male female patient childbearing potential must use appropriate birth control ( abstinence , barrier method , oral contraceptive and/or intrauterine device ) entire duration study , patient must surgically sterile ( documentation patient 's medical record ) . Impaired liver function , evidence prior liver segmentectomy hemihepatectomy ; alanine aspartate aminotransferase ( ALAT/ASAT ) &gt; 2.5x ULN ; alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.0x ULN ; bilirubin &gt; 2.0x ULN . Abnormal clotting , evidence PT PTT &gt; 1.5x ULN , therapeutic/prophylactic anticoagulation . Renal impairment , define either serum creatinine high institution ULN , estimate creatinine clearance lower LLN ( i.e . patient normal serum creatinine , normal estimate creatinine clearance ) Impaired marrow function , define haemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g/dL , neutrophils &lt; 1.5 x10^9/L , platelet &lt; 100 x10^9/L . Patients may receive blood transfusion anaemia allow entry study transfusiondependent . Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50 % echocardiography MUGA scan . Known metastasis central nervous system . Prior anticancer therapy include tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( imatinib ) complete within 2 week 5 halflives agent ( include know active metabolite ) prior treatment study drug . Patients receive imatinib continue receive imatinib ( 400 mg daily ) throughout screen period . Clinically important intolerance safety concern prior use imatinib 400 mg daily . Prior treatment HSP90 inhibitor . Major surgery within 14 day prior treatment study drug , failure recover effect surgery . Wide field radiotherapy within 4 week prior treatment study drug , limited field radiation within 2 week , failure recover therapy . History ischaemic cardiac event unstable cardiac disease within 3 month study entry . QTc &gt; 450 m use Fredericia 's correction . Previous malignancy , except basal cell squamous cell skin carcinoma carcinoma uterine cervix , unless treat curative intent 2 year prior study entry . Evidence severe uncontrolled systemic medical condition make undesirable patient take part study , could jeopardize protocol compliance . Patients multiple comorbidities and/or require multiple concomitant medication ( especially conditions/medications may impair renal function predispose renal impairment ) discuss Astex Medical Monitor discretion Investigator enrollment . Prior history infection HIV , know active hepatitis B C viral infection ( active screen viral infection require study entry ) . Significant visual impairment opinion investigator , minor deterioration would unacceptable consequence ( eg . loss ability drive live home . The Safety Monitoring Committee may add specific exclusion criterion enhance safety patient base emerge safety data .</criteria>
