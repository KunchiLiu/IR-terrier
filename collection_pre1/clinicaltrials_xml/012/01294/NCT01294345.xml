	<brief_summary>Background : - Congenital malformation , sometimes call birth defect , occur difference early human development . There many different type congenital malformation , cause change genetic material . Researchers interested study individual congenital malformation well understand cause effect certain congenital malformation . Objectives : - To understand cause congenital malformation arise early human development . - To learn genetic cause find explain person congenital malformation . Eligibility : - Individuals diagnose congenital malformation . Design : - Participants see National Institutes Health series visit 3 4 day . Participants ask provide copy past medical record test result review , ask question pregnancy/prenatal history , birth , newborn , medical , developmental , family history . - Parents sibling participant may also ask provide information research purpose . - Participants may additional medical evaluation part study , include follow test : - Physical examination - Other consultation clinically indicate - Blood sample genetic test - Tissue biopsy genetic test - Photographs affect area , front side view face body part may involve congenital malformation , like hand foot . - Other test indicate specific malformation , organ ultrasound . - No additional invasive testing , test require sedation , test involve radiation plan protocol . These test , perform , would involve separate consent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent advance genomic technique make possible new wave genetic discovery . We hope couple genomic technique traditional method involve genetic discovery order investigate broad range condition strong evidence genetic factor involve . To accomplish , plan enroll approximately five family , member congenital malformation consistent error early human development , research protocol year . Patients refer outside clinician may self-refer , may see NIH Clinical Center may send sample test . Some participant , already DNA tissue store , may reconsented specific participation protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : For affected individual ( individual relate person meet criteria ( 1 ) may also include research protocol ) , determination clinical criterion inclusion determine prior medical record review participation . Presence congenital malformation relate medical find thought related error early human development . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Anyone unwilling provide inform consent ( adult , behalf child minor , behalf adult unable provide consent ) assent . Clear evidence presence condition diagnostic test already available .</criteria>
