	<brief_title>Trial Compare Intra-individually Efficacy Tolerance Oleogel-S10 Versus Moist Wound Healing Dressing Alone Accelerating Epithelialization Split Thickness Skin Graft Donor Sites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As first step , adequate size wound heal dress ( Mepilex ) take cut half . Then , half SSG ( split skin graft ) wound cover conventionally apply one half Mepilex cut . Afterwards Oleogel-S10 apply half Mepilex cut , use cover half SSG wound . Both part Mepilex dressing cover additional conventional dressing . Oleogel-S10 always apply part SSG wound patient , respectively , depend randomization patient , either towards periphery body , i.e . low part leg , towards centre part body , i.e . upper part leg . In order avoid confusion part treat Oleogel-S10 , healthy skin next SSG wound mark ink indication Oleogel-treated part wound . Each day treatment period , whenever wound dress change , clinical examination assessment progress epithelialization SSG wound conduct , include evaluation tolerance , photo wound without dress take . A blinded assessment efficacy conduct two independent investigator use macro-photos every day , wound dressing change , final examination do . In assessment , third part SSG wound leave right part neglect .</detailed_description>
