	<brief_title>Study AOBO-001 Overactive Bladder With Urge Urinary Incontinence Frequency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial evaluate safety efficacy AOBO-001 adult overactive bladder . The primary objective study evaluate efficacy AOBO 001 compare placebo basis change baseline average number micturition episodes per 24 hour 3-day diary average number urge urinary incontinence episode per 24 hour 3 day diary double-blind treatment period adult patient OAB . Secondary efficacy objective evaluate efficacy AOBO-001 compare placebo basis number severity urgency episodes use Patient 's Perception Intensity Urgency Scale ( PPIUS ) , nocturia episode , volume void per micturition , Patient Perception Bladder Condition ( PPBC ) global assessment measure . An additional secondary objective evaluate safety tolerability AOBO-001 compare placebo . Eligible patient randomize equal proportion double-blind treatment AOBO 001 1.6 g twice daily ( 3.2 g daily ) , AOBO-001 3.2 g twice daily ( 6.4 g daily ) placebo capsule twice daily . Efficacy assessment include urinary diary assessment , include number micturition ( daytime , nighttime ) , number urge incontinence episode , number/grading urgency episode ( Patient 's Perception Intensity Urgency Scale PPIUS ) , volume void urine ; Patient Perception Bladder Condition ( PPBC ) questionnaire . Safety assessment include post-void residual urine volume measure bladder scan ; vital sign , 12-lead ECGs , complete brief physical examination , clinical laboratory safety test , treatment-emergent adverse event .</detailed_description>
