	<brief_summary>Many hospitalize infant develop flatten back side head . This condition develop gradually infant 's head rest firm semi-firm surface prolong period time . Premature infant likely positional head shape deformity may spend long period time crib . Infants participate study randomly assign either standard treatment , moldable positioner device , cranial cup device moldable positioner positioning . The purpose prospective single-blinded randomized clinical trial evaluate effectiveness cranial cup prevent positional head shape deformity NICU patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary outcome study cranial index cranial symmetry measure hospital discharge ; secondary outcome measure incidence oxygen desaturation event ( apnea , bradycardia oxygen desaturation ) . The pilot study undertaken evaluate cranial cup successfully incorporate NICU patient care regime , pilot study include 5 infant . The main trial enrollment estimate 160 infant 4 center . Upon enrollment infant randomize one two study group - Cranial cup moldable positioner - Moldable positioner Inclusion criterion : There several inclusion criterion participation study : 1 . Infants born &gt; /= 22 week gestation 2 . Infant &lt; /= 7 day age 3 . Infants receive medical clearance healthcare team 4 . Infants estimate minimum NICU length stay = / &gt; 14 day time enrollment Infants stratify study site weight enrollment ( &lt; 1000 gram versus = / &gt; 1000 gram ) .</detailed_description>

Infants estimate minimum NICU length stay = / &gt; 14 day time enrollment 1 . Infants require prone positioning maintain airway patency ( Pierre Robin Syndrome/Sequence ) eligible participate ; infant must able lie supine least part day use cranial cup 2 . Infants require medical device continuous ventricular drain , subgaleal shunt , intravenous catheter ( unless placement IV temporary ) prevent proper position use cranial cup 3 . Infants craniofacial anomaly , cervical anomaly , critical airway infant 4 . Infants Cutis Aplasia significant skin breakdown scalp , cranial cup may worsen preexist condition 5 . Infants prenatal diagnosis craniosynostosis 6 . Infants deem suitable participation attend neonatologist 7 . Infants transfer nonparticipating hospital within 14 day enrollment timeframe may adequate show difference head shape</criteria>
