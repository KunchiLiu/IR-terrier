	<detailed_description>Liver failure ( LF ) severe life-threatening condition , dramatic clinical syndrome massive necrosis liver cell , liver transplantation available therapeutic option patient suffer condition . However , lack donor , surgical complication , rejection , high cost serious problem . Since current therapeutic option LF usually extremely poor prognosis still limit , recent study indicate mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) , due function immune modulation liver-damage repair , great therapeutic potential disease . Previous study show bone marrow derive mesenchymal stem cell ( BM-MSCs ) replace hepatocytes injure liver , effectively rescue experimental liver failure contribute liver regeneration.The purpose study investigate safety initial efficacy human umbilical cord MSC ( UC-MSCs ) treatment patient LF . In study , MSCs isolate umbilical cord generate appropriate growth medium . 50 LF patient LF receive i.v . transfusion 0.5-1.0Ã—106 cells/kg MSCs treat group 20 LF patient LF transfuse placebo without MSCs control group . All 70 receive routine management liver failure . During 2-year follow , evaluation safty efficacy undergone help establish innovative cell-based therapy treatment disease .</detailed_description>
