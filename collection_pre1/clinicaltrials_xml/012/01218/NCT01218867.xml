	<brief_summary>Background : The National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Surgery Branch develop experimental therapy treat patient metastatic cancer involve take white blood cell patient , grow laboratory large number , genetically modify specific cell type virus ( retrovirus ) attack tumor cell , give cell back patient . This type therapy call gene transfer . In protocol , modify patient white blood cell retrovirus gene anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR2 ) incorporate retrovirus . Objectives : - To determine safe number cell infuse see safety effectiveness cell therapy use anti-VEGFR2 gene modify tumor white blood cell treat recurrent relapse cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals great equal 18 year age less equal 70 year age diagnose metastatic cancer respond relapsed standard treatment . Design : - Work stage : Patients see outpatient National Institutes Health ( NIH ) clinical Center undergo history physical examination , scan , x-ray , lab test , test need - Leukapheresis : If patient meet requirement study undergo leukapheresis obtain white blood cell make anti-VEGFR2 cell . { Leukapheresis common procedure remove white blood cell patient . } - Treatment : Once cell grown patient admit hospital conditioning chemotherapy , anti-VEGFR2 cell aldesleukin . They stay hospital about4 week treatment . - Follow : Patients return clinic physical exam , review side effect , lab test , scan every 1-3 month first year , every 6 month 1 year long tumor shrink . Follow visit take 2 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CAR T Cell Receptor Immunotherapy Targeting VEGFR2 Patients With Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - We construct single retroviral vector contain chimeric T cell receptor ( CAR ) recognize Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) , use mediate genetic transfer CAR high efficiency ( &gt; 50 % ) without need perform selection . Administration VEGFR2 CAR transduce cell inhibited tumor growth several different model different mouse strain . - In co-cultures VEGFR2 express cell , anti-VEGFR2 transduce T cell secrete significant amount interferon ( IFN ) gamma high specificity . Objectives : Primary objective : - To evaluate safety administration anti-VEGFR2 CAR engineer cluster differentiation 8 ( CD8 ) + peripheral blood lymphocytes patient receive non- myeloablative conditioning regimen , aldesleukin . - Determine administration anti-VEGFR2 CAR engineer CD8+ peripheral blood lymphocyte aldesleukin patient follow nonmyeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic cancer . Secondary objective : -Determine vivo survival CAR gene-engineered cell . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old must : - metastatic cancer ; - previously receive non-responder recur standard care metastatic disease ; Patients may : -contraindications high dose aldesleukin administration . Design : - Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obtain leukapheresis ( approximately 5 time 10 ( 9 ) cell ) culture presence anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) aldesleukin order stimulate T-cell growth . - Transduction initiated exposure approximately 10 ( 8 ) 5 time 10 ( 8 ) cell retroviral vector supernatant contain VEGFR2 gene . - Patients receive nonmyeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow intravenous infusion ex vivo CAR gene-transduced CD8+ PBMC plus intravenous ( IV ) aldesleukin . With approval amendment C , aldesleukin ( base total body weight ) administer dose 72,000 IU/kg intravenous bolus 15 minute period approximately every eight hour ( +/- 1 hour ) beginning within 24 hour cell infusion continue 5 day ( maximum 15 dos - Patients undergo complete evaluation tumor physical examination , compute tomography ( CT ) chest , abdomen pelvis clinical laboratory evaluation four six week treatment . If patient stable disease ( SD ) tumor shrinkage , repeat complete evaluation perform every 1-3 month . After first year , patient continue respond continue follow evaluation every 3-4 month study criterion meet . - The study conduct use Phase I/II optimal design . The protocol proceed phase 1 dose escalation design . Initially , protocol enroll 1 patient dose cohort unless patient experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) . Should single patient experience dose limit toxicity due cell transfer particular dose level , additional patient would treat dose confirm great 1/6 patient DLT prior proceed next high level . If level 2 DLTs 3-6 patient identify , three additional patient accrue next-lowest dose , total 6 , order characterize safety maximum tolerate dose prior start phase II portion . If dose limit toxicity occur first cohort , cohort expand 6 patient . If 2 DLTs encounter cohort , study terminate . If IFN-gamma level increase substantially ( define protocol ) patient cohort compare prior patient , cohort would expand n=3 obtain data phenomenon . If one 3 patient experience DLT , cohort expand six patient . Following amendment C , patient enrol cohort 8-11 , non-myeloablative chemotherapy regimen , cell low dose aldesleukin follow conventional 3+3 design . Once maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine , study would proceed phase II portion . Patients enter two cohort base histology : cohort 1 include patient metastatic melanoma renal cancer , cohort 2 include patient type metastatic cancer . - For 2 stratum evaluate , study conduct use phase II optimal design initially 21 evaluable patient enrol . For two arm trial , 0 1 21 patient experience clinical response , patient enrol 2 first 21 evaluable patient enrol clinical response , accrual continue total 41 evaluable patient enrol stratum . - The objective determine combination aldesleukin , lymphocyte deplete chemotherapy , anti-VEGFR2 CAR-gene engineer CD8+ lymphocytes able associated clinical response rate rule 5 % ( p0=0.05 ) favor modest 20 % partial response ( PR ) + complete response ( CR ) rate ( p1=0.20 ) .</detailed_description>
