	<brief_title>The Effect Anti-epileptic Drugs Mitochondrial Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiepileptic drug adverse reaction , include hepatotoxicity , rare potentially fatal , especially among child . Although mechanism liver toxicity remain elusive , mitochondrial oxidative stress , hypothesize play role . Most study address antiepileptic drug effect mitochondria discuss effect valproic acid . The exact mechanism involve drug-induced effect oxidative phosphorylation still far resolve . Most study investigate effect valproic acid use animal model different vitro methods.Mitochondrial disease consider risk factor valproic acid-induced hepatotoxicity , consensus avoid administration drug patientsIs possible antiepileptic drug similar effect ? The knowledge regard effect antiepileptic drug mitochondria relatively scarce .</detailed_description>
