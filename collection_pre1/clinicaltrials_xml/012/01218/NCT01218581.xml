	<brief_summary>To date , uniform agreement appropriate therapeutic method manage woman uterine adenomyosis and/or adenomyoma want preserve fertility . Management hormonal treatment aim reduce proliferation endometrial cell promise , paucity well-designed study guide treatment . There strong need develop pharmacological agent provide efficient outcome . Gonadotripn release hormone analogue ( GnRHa ) use several study , produce constant hypoestrogenic state woman adenomyosis cause amenorrhoea , control pain uterine shrinkage . Pure antiestrogens , however , may offer advantage treatment adenomyosis trial require assess usefulness . Leiomyoma uterine volume successfully reduce use aromatase inhibitor ( AIs ) . Assuming aromatase production activity adenomyosis lesion , Kimura et al , use GnRHa AI concomitantly treatment uterine adenomyosis . This lack information stimulate u run trial compare efficacy aromatase inhibitor vs. GnRHa treat premenopausal woman uterine adenomyosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , non-blind trial perform period December 2005 January 2010 teach hospital affiliate Mansoura University ( Egypt ) private practice setting ( Delta Fertility Center , Egypt ) . Thirty eight patient assessed eligibility , 6 patient exclude 32 uterine adenomyosis include study . Patients include study premenopausal woman age 18-42 year adenomyosis abnormal uterine bleeding , unexplained infertility , pelvic pain , dysmenorrhea , pressure effect . Excluded subject include woman myoma ( ) measure &gt; 2 cm , woman uterine adenomyoma treatment type hormonal therapy recently 1 month , woman history major medical problem and/or previous medical surgical treatment problem . Patients randomly allocate two treatment group ( A B ) use computer-generated random table . Group A receive oral letrozole ( 2.5 mg/day , Femara , Novartis PharmaServices , Basel , Switzerland ) group B receive goserelin subcutaneosly ( 3.6 mg/month , Zoladex @ , Zeneka Pharma International , UK ) 12 week . Because , technical reason , GnRHa supply vial aromatase inhibitor tablet , double-blind study design feasible . Instead assessor-blind design chosen , whereby preparation administration perform person take part decision concern medication administration study . The study approve ethic committee university institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , subject provide write informed consent participate study . All subject underwent baseline measurement , perform early follicular phase . An expert gynecologist perform transvaginal ultrasound scan analysis use D 4000 ( Honda , Japan ) ultrasound machine 5.5-MHz vaginal probe . Ultrasound criterion use diagnosis adenomyosis include uterine enlargement absence leiomyoma , asymmetric enlargement anterior posterior myometrial wall , lack contour abnormality mass effect , heterogeneous , poorly circumcise area within myometrium , hyperechoic island nodule , finger-like projection linear striation . After identification adenomyosis , volume calculate stepwise planimetry method use integrated software program . Measurements whole uterine adenomyoma volume perform baseline treatment week 4 , 8 , 12 . Symptoms start 12 week therapy evaluate .</detailed_description>
