	<brief_summary>There currently useful test identify patient respond cetuximab therapy , notably EGFR level correlate clinical response observe . Thus , investigator investigate role cellular immunity immune escape mechanism explain differential clinical response cetuximab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ERBITUX® Followed Adjuvant Treatment With Chemoradiation ERBITUX® Locally Advanced Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective phase II clinical trial preoperative , single-agent cetuximab treat patient conduct order obtain specimen 4 week cetuximab immune biomarker study . Stage III/IV HNC patient treat definitive surgical resection observe disease recurrence . Cetuximab administer 3-4 week preoperative period study biomarker modulation correlation clinical response CT scan tumor apoptosis/proliferation tumor excision , immediately neoadjuvant cetuximab surgery . We biopsy skin/acneiform rash patient correlate rash biomarker modulation clinical response . Cetuximab may also give adjuvant set . A primary scientific hypothesis test : short term pre-operative exposure cetuximab modulate blood immune biomarkers immune modulation associate anti-tumor effect ? Forty ( n=40 ) patient complete specimen ( tumor , peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) serum ) necessary enable adequate statistical power reach use paired specimen . A secondary set hypothesis evaluate association pre-operative biomarker level modulation disease recurrence . The propose trial accrue stage II , III IV surgical candidate without distant metastasis .</detailed_description>
