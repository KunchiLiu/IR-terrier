	<brief_title>Lapatinib WBRT Patients With Brain Metastases From Lung Breast Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients breast lung cancer develop brain metastasis treat WBRT ( 30Gy 10 fraction ) lapatinib 1250mg daily , follow lapatinib treatment 1500mg daily total duration 6 week . At 6 week timepoint , radiological assessment brain MRI take place evaluate response patient . Subsequent 6 week treatment period lapatinib , patient may discontinue lapatinib monotherapy physician proceed therapy , accord discretion . The patient followed-up every 12 week disease progression survival .</detailed_description>
