	<brief_summary>Malaria one major infectious disease world tremendous impact quality life significantly contribute ongoing poverty endemic country . It cause almost one million death per year , majority child age five . The malaria parasite enters human body skin , bite infected mosquito . Subsequently , invades liver develop multiplies inside hepatocytes . After week , hepatocytes burst open parasite release blood stream , cause clinical phase disease . As unique opportunity study malaria immunology efficacy immunisation strategy , protocol develop past conduct experimental human malaria infection ( EHMIs ) . EHMIs generally involve small group malaria-naïve volunteer infect via bite P. falciparum infect laboratory-reared Anopheline mosquito . Although potentially serious even lethal , P. falciparum malaria radically cure early stage blood infection risk complication virtually absent . The investigator show previously healthy human volunteer protect malaria mosquito ( sporozoite ) challenge immunization sporozoite ( mosquito bite ) chloroquine prophylaxis ( CPS immunization ) . However , unknown many mosquito bite necessary confer protection . Moreover , volunteer protect study , correlate protection could establish . For future development vaccine understand protective immunity malaria , important investigate low dose CPS immunization confers 100 % protection find correlates protection . Therefore , present study aim make CPS immunization protocol sensitive lower number infect mosquito bite , order study underlie mechanism protection .</brief_summary>
