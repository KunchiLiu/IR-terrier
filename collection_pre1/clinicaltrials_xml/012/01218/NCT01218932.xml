	<brief_summary>This standard pharmacokinetic interaction study . Subjects randomized either group A B . Group A . Subjects 3 hospitalization complete . Each hospitalization 12-24 hour depend regimen . Subjects A group receive regimen 1 primaquine ( PQ ) first admission ( visit 2 ) receive regimen 2 primaquine chloroquine combination ( PQ CQ ) second admission ( visit 3 ) 1 week wash period finish regimen 3 Chloroquine ( CQ ) third admission ( visit 4 ) 8 week wash period . Subjects B group receive regimen 1 primaquine ( PQ ) receive regimen 2 chloroquine ( CQ ) second admission ( visit 3 ) 1 week wash period regimen 3 primaquine chloroquine combination ( PQ CQ ) third admission ( visit 4 ) 8 week wash period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chloroquine primaquine , first therapy Plasmodium vivax ovale malaria 50 year , part National policy Thailand decade . Primaquine available hypnozoitocidal drug P.vivax gametocytocidal agent Plasmodium falciparum malaria . Despite enormous use knowledge mechanism activity , pharmacokinetic property , resistance toxicity primaquine limit . Primaquine previously use dose radical cure ( 15 mg base/day 14 day ) also weakly effective asexual stage P. vivax malaria [ 4 ] The high dose 30 mg daily evaluate malaria prophylaxis also generally recommended radical cure . In standard radical cure regimen , primaquine usually give 3-day course chloroquine , study inform time dose decision arbitrary . Despite multistage specificity malaria parasite , extensive recommendation , primaquine currently underused uncertainty safety , efficacy dosage . Primaquine oxidant drug cause haemolysis patient glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency ( G6PD ) . Although several study metabolite primaquine chloroquine conduct past year remarkably little known interaction two commonly coadministered drug . This study open-label pharmacokinetic study . Healthy 16 volunteer recruit establish volunteer facility single site Hospital Tropical Diseases determine pharmacokinetic property primaquine 's main active metabolite evaluate interaction chloroquine.in order provide clinical guidance optimum primaquine/chloroquine treatment regimen .</detailed_description>
