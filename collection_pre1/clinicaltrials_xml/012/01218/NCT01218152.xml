	<detailed_description>Introduction Neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) autosomal dominant disorder occur 1 3500 living newborn . The disease cause heterozygous mutation NF1 gene , locate chromosome 17q11.2 . The NF1 gene encodes tumor suppressor neurofibromin , negative regulator RAS oncogene . Clinically , NF1 patient café-au-lait macula , freckling , Lisch nodules neurofibromas . Cognitive problem , bone lesion optic pathway glioma also common patient . Neurofibromas benign neoplasms peripheral nerve sheath , appear anywhere body NF1 patient . Neurofibromas compose different cell type like Schwann cell , fibroblast , mast cell perineurial cell . If Schwann cell NF1 patient wild-type NF1 allele inactivate , neurofibroma form . There 3 type neurofibromas : cutaneous , subcutaneous plexiform . Cutaneous neurofibromas appear adolescence isolate nodule skin , respectively . Plexiform neurofibromas congenital spread along large segment peripheral nerve . Subcutaneous neurofibromas discrete nodule locate peripheral nerve time origin know , probably also prenatal origin . Every NF1 patient life time risk 8 13 % develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ( MPNST ) . This risk even twice high subpopulation NF1 patient , namely patient NF1 microdeletion . MPNSTs difficult diagnose early phase large number tumor diverse location often see patient . These tumor infiltrate easily surround tissue frequently give rise metastasis . At moment , available treatment surgical removal MPNSTs . Complete resection often difficult due size tumor location important nerve fact tumor frequently already metastasize diagnosis . The five-year survival patient MPNSTs less 25 % . For MPNSTs , like cancer , extent spread disease time diagnosis important factor determine treatment outcome . In regard , tumor marker develop screen tumor , subset cancer secrete specific protein use marker . An increase interest grow new marker like circulate nucleic acid . The detection cell-free circulating nucleic acid plasma , serum body fluids healthy diseased individual open possibility diagnose monitor disease , might also applicable NF1 patient MPNSTs . The presence extracellular circulate nucleic acid blood healthy sick person first describe Mandel Métais 1948 . In 1977 group Leon first quantify cell-free DNA serum . They find cancer patient tend elevated level circulate DNA compare healthy control individual , amount DNA even big patient metastasis compare localized disease , nothing know origin DNA . Significant progress plasma/serum DNA research make , presence tumor-associated microsatellite alteration report plasma serum cancer patient . According finding , suggest circulate DNA could potentials diagnosis prognosis malignancy . Still , mechanism DNA release fully clarify , different hypothesis suggest . A first hypothesis circulate DNA originate DNA leakage due necrosis apoptosis tumor cell , become controversial report DNA level decrease radiotherapy . Another hypothesis micrometastases also reject number cell plasma n't match amount circulate DNA . A third hypothesis spontaneous active release tumoral DNA blood proliferate cell . However convincing explanation latter mechanism . Research protocol A first part study optimization technique DNA extraction plasma . Different DNA extraction method describe literature test sample collect cooperation Prof. Dr. Patrick Schöffski ( UZLeuven ) . When blood take cancer patient routine testing , additional 5 mL ( EDTA tube ) available experiment . Blood sample collect within hour sample process within 24 hour lab ( lab neurofibromatosis research ) . The blood sample centrifuge 1600 rpm 10 minute . The supernatant plasma collect , without disturb buffy coat , re-centrifuged 13000 rpm 10 minute remove particle . The supernatant plasma aliquoted 0.5 mL volume . The sample store -80°C use . Per patient , different aliquot extract use different method , like phenol-chloroform extraction commercial kit , accord literature . Genomic reference DNA extract buffy coat use phenol-chloroform extraction . Depending type DNA extraction , expect difference quantity quality DNA . The method high yield best DNA quality choose extract DNA plasma NF1 patient MPNSTs . Second part work optimization microarray experiment use plasma DNA . Plasma sample NF1 patient MPNSTs collect collaboration group Victor Mautner Eppendorf University Germany . Direct process blood sample do Germany frozen buffy coat plasma aliquots send Leuven encode way . Together buffy coat plasma , frozen tissue patient MPNST send well . DNA tumor extract use phenol-chloroform extraction . Microarray CGH perform tumor plasma DNA buffy coat DNA reference exclude copy number variable region list copy number change . The array profile plasma DNA check tumor-related copy number change . In way , array protocol optimize order detect tumor specific copy number abnormalities cell-free DNA plasma . This study perform Eline Beert , PhD student lab neurofibromatosis research , Radost Ratcheva , master thesis student lab neurofibromatosis research , part achieve degree 'Doctor Biomedical Sciences ' 'Master Biomedical Sciences ' , respectively , Prof. Dr. Eric Legius promotor main researcher . Only Katholieke Universiteit Leuven UZ Leuven , commercial partner ( like company ) participate study . The result obtain described experiment consider pure scientific information none report patient . The blood sample UZLeuven cancer patient use optimize DNA extraction procedure , extract DNA quantify analyzed destroyed afterwards .</detailed_description>
