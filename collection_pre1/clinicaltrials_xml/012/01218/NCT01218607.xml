	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND Atrial septal defect ( ASD ) represent approximately 10 % congenital heart diseases third common form congenital heart defect . The incidence congenital heart disease Belgium 1 % , ASD account 25 % case ( Data database congenital heart diseases UZ Leuven . ) Characterized free communication leave right atrium , may take form ostium secundum defect ( region fossa ovalis ) ; ostium primum defect ( low part atrial septum associate mitral regurgitation ) sinus venosus defect ( upper atrial septum associate anomalous drainage one pulmonary vein ) Patients atrial septal defect ( ASD ) initially present left-to-right shunt , may cause elevate pulmonary artery pressure rest and/or exercise . However , persistently elevate pulmonary blood-flow also cause progressive lesion pulmonary vasculature , first describe Heath Edwards . The early stage present medial hypertrophy and/or intimal proliferation largely reversible closure defect . Later stage , however , irriversible : origin pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . Eventually , volume pressure overload right heart may lead heart failure and/or arrhythmia . As PVR exceed systemic resistance , shunt reverse ( right-to-left shunt ) lead systemic arterial desaturation ( related consequence : polyglobulia , hyperuricemia , decrease renal function abnormal coagulation ) : Eisenmenger syndrome ( ES ) . When occlusive fibrotic lesion develop later life , closure ASD , although still feasible , may result complete normalization pulmonary artery pressure . Moreover , show closure age 40 year associated bad outcome . It suggest abnormal increase pulmonary artery pressure exercise reflect mild pulmonary vascular disease . However , pulmonary artery pressure define cardiac output pulmonary vascular resistance . During exercise , relationship pulmonary artery pressure cardiac output slightly curvilinear natural distensibility pulmonary arteriole . Using bicycle stress echocardiography , pulmonary vascular resistance estimate either ratio pulmonary artery pressure cardiac output stage ( total PVR ) use linear regression analysis pressure-flow plot ( dynamic PVR ) . Prognosis patient unrepaired ASDs think shorten repair avoid right ventricular ( RV ) failure , pulmonary hypertension , thrombo-embolic event atrial dysrrhythmias . So , defect discover early , ASD usually close childhood , unless defect consider clinical significant . Sometimes , patient isolate ASD asymptomatic childhood , ASD come medical attention old age . Patients correct ASD poor prognosis patient control group , especially presence PAH , confers eightfold increase probability functional limitation . In Euroheart survey PAH present 12 % patient close ASD . As PAH progressive disease , early diagnosis treatment may improve outcome patient . A first analysis data obtain registry ASD show transcatheter close ASD patient , mPAP independent predictor atrial arrhythmia ASD repair . Moreover , first prospective study show possible identify patient mild pulmonary vascular disease use stress echocardiography patient ASD close later age unable decrease pulmonary vascular resistance exercise , result high pulmonary vascular resistance peak exercise compare control group . This reflected steep pressure-flow plot compare healthy control . Endothelin show influence vasomotor tone , especially exercise . Moreover , Faoro et al show bosentan decrease pulmonary vascular resistance assess pressure-flow plot hypoxia . Therefore , study design evaluate effect dual endothelin receptor antagonist total pulmonary vascular resistance exercise old ASD patient population . 1.2 DRUG PROFILE Mechanism action Bosentan dual endothelin receptor antagonist ( ERA ) affinity endothelin A B ( ET-A ET-B ) receptor . Bosentan decrease pulmonary systemic vascular resistance result increased cardiac output without increase heart rate . The neurohormone endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) one potent vasoconstrictor know also promote fibrosis , cell proliferation , cardiac hypertrophy , remodel pro-inflammatory . These effect mediate endothelin bind ET-A ET-B receptor locate endothelium vascular smooth muscle cell . ET-1 concentration tissue plasma increase several cardiovascular disorder connective tissue disease , include pulmonary arterial hypertension , scleroderma , acute chronic heart failure , myocardial ischaemia , systemic hypertension atherosclerosis , suggest pathogenic role ET-1 disease . In pulmonary arterial hypertension heart failure , absence endothelin receptor antagonism , elevate ET-1 concentration strongly correlate severity prognosis disease . Bosentan compete bind ET-1 ET peptides ET-A ET-B receptor , slightly high affinity ET-A receptor ( Ki = 4.1-43 nM ) ET-B receptor ( Ki = 38-730 nM ) . Bosentan specifically antagonise ET receptor bind receptor . 1.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE STUDY Although ASD seem easily correctable defect , patient repair ASD poor prognosis patient control group , especially presence PAH , confers eightfold increase probability functional limitation . In Euroheart survey PAH present 12 % patient close ASD . Whether useful treat mild moderate pulmonary vascular disease repair ASD specific PAH treatment order positive effect exercise capacity even outcome outcome still need evaluated . As outlined section 1.1 , investigator able identify patient mild pulmonary vascular disease use bicycle exercise echocardiography . Patients ASD repair age 40 year appear high PVR compare healthy control . Moreover , old patient higher mPAP diagnosis independent predictor occurrence late atrial arrhythmia . Therefore , present study investigate whether bosentan beneficial effect PVR measure bicycle stress echocardiography patient repair ASD WHO FC II mild pulmonary vascular disease use dynamic PVR surrogate endpoint . 1.3.1 DOSE AND POSOLOGY Treatment initiate dose 62.5 mg twice daily 4 week increase maintenance dose 125 mg twice daily 12 week . Dosage elderly patient : No dosage adjustment require patient age 65 year . 2 . STUDY OBJECTIVES The primary efficacy objective ass efficacy dual active endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan patient WHO functional class II mild moderate PAH surgical interventional closure ASD . 3 . STUDY DESIGN This prospective , monocentric , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , pilot study evaluate efficacy dual active endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan patient WHO FC II , mild pulmonary vascular disease ASD repair . 4 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE The null hypothesis study patient receive specific PAH treatment change PVR observe . This trial aim demonstrate efficacy bosentan low PVR assess bicycle exercise echocardiography patient surgically transcatheter closed ASD . 5 RANDOMISATION Patients randomly assign treatment group equal probability assignment treatment arm ( allocation ratio 1:1 ) . The randomisation schedule generate use validated software . The investigator remain blinded randomisation schedule final database lock . The randomisation schedule examine required emergency . Any break document clearly . 6 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION As study design consider pilot trial , primarily aim define mean standard deviation treatment arm order allow future sample size calculation .</detailed_description>
