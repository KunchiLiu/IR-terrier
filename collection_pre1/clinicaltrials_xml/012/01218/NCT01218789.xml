	<brief_title>Safety Study Tasimelteon Treatment Non-24-Hour-Sleep-Wake Disorder Blind Individuals With No Light Perception</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder ( N24HSWD ) occur individual , primarily without light perception , unable synchronize endogenous circadian pacemaker 24-hour light-dark cycle , time circadian rhythm instead reflect intrinsic period endogenous circadian pacemaker . As result , circadian rhythm sleep-wake propensity individual move gradually later later day circadian period &gt; 24 hour earlier earlier &lt; 24 hour . These individual able sleep well night sleep-wake propensity rhythm approximately align 24-hour light-dark social cycle . However , short time , endogenous sleep-wake propensity rhythm 24-hour light-dark cycle move synchrony , may difficulty fall asleep well night . In addition problem sleep desired time , subject experience daytime sleepiness daytime nap . This multicenter , open-label study . The study two phase : screen phase evaluation phase . The screen phase comprise screen visit patient 's general health initial eligibility evaluate . The evaluation phase comprise baseline visit 52 week segment . Patients meet entry criterion study baseline visit enter treatment segment patient ask take 20 mg tasimelteon daily approximately 60 minute prior target bedtime 52 week open-label fashion . An optional sub-study extension phase available subject complete first year treatment consist continued open-label treatment 3 year additional .</detailed_description>
