	<brief_summary>This randomize , double-blind placebo-controlled study evaluate efficacy zoledronic acid biologic incorporation cementless hip prosthesis postmenopausal female patients.The study population consist postmenopausal female patient schedule total hip replacement degenerative hip osteoarthritis . The patient receive either single dose 5 mg zoledronic acid placebo intravenously surgery hospital discharge . The patient followed-up 1 year . Zoledronic acid therapy show promote bone ingrowth porous implant pre-clinical model . The investigator hypothesis zoledronic acid , give single intravenous infusion hip replacement surgery , enhance bone ingrowth porous surface cementless hip prosthesis . As primary outcome , therapy expect reduce periprosthetic bone loss measure DXA . Enhancement bone ingrowth expect increase primary stability hip prosthesis effect detect high-precision three-dimensional RSA image modality faster functional recovery patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Zoledronic Acid Enhancement Early Stability Cementless Primary Hip Prosthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient enrol study receive standard care respect surgical prosthetic replacement diseased hip . The patient receive custom-modified ( RSA mark ) hydroxyapatite-coated prosthesis ceramic-on-ceramic bearing surface ( SYMAX-TRIDENT , Stryker ) . The prosthesis modification provide manufacturer CE mark . The patient active-treatment group receive single 5 mg dose zoledronic acid intravenously prior release hospital ( 5th day post-surgery ) adjunct therapy . The control group receive placebo ( saline ) infusion . The active placebo infusion vial provide Norvartis Pharmaceutical . After surgery , administration zoledronic acid placebo , patient re-screened level serum calcium . In case postoperative hypocalcemia , infusion postpone minimum 3-4 week infusion give repeat measurement serum calcium . All patient receive calcium D-vitamin supplementation throughout study period . Efficacy assessed basis clinical , radiographic ( RSA , DXA , Spiral CT , conventional radiography ) laboratory criterion . The clinical benefit zoledronic acid therapy define term faster functional recovery , analyze two way : ( 1 ) functional outcome ( muscle strength , gait analysis pedometry ) repeatedly evaluate surgery , ( 2 ) subjective outcome procedure well general health assessment determine follow-up visit use standardized outcome measure . The primary objective study test whether single infusion zoledronic acid reduce periprosthetic bone loss measure DXA 12 month . Statistical significance difference periprosthetic bone mineral density active-treatment placebo group analyze use repeat analysis variance .</detailed_description>
