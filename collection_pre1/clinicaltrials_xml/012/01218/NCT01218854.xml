	<brief_summary>Background : - Currently , standard procedure biopsy guide compute tomography ( CT ) image involve CT scan computer program plan illustrate physician place needle obtain required cell tissue . Inserting biopsy needle plan angle easy task , appropriate angle insertion must estimate base prior experience . Researchers study experimental technique might provide good guidance right angle insert biopsy needle thereby improve collection appropriate biopsy cell tissue . Objectives : - To evaluate effectiveness two biopsy needle guidance method CT-guided tissue biopsy . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age schedule CT-guided tissue biopsy . Design : - Participants tissue biopsy guide CT scan either laser system plastic block illustrate appropriate angle insertion . The skin numb anesthetic minimize discomfort procedure . - Before insert biopsy needle , study physician hold needle place Food Drug Administration-approved medical GPS ( electromagnetic tracking ) system measure needle angle enters tissue . - After needle angle data collect , researcher proceed actual biopsy procedure would normally occur , use standard method . - No additional treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Methods Assisting Needle Angle Selection During Image-guided Tissue Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Currently , standard/conventional CT-guided biopsy proceed follow physician : 1. obtains pre-procedural CT scan , 2. plan needle angle base CT scan , 3. selects angle needle insert base pre-procedural CT scan , 4. insert needle aim replicate plan needle angle use visual-spatial ability , 5. re-images patient confirm needle location follow needle repositioning , need . - Improving upon standard method needle placement could widespread benefit ( e.g . improve diagnostic tissue sampling , decrease needle repositioning , etc . ) We study three needle angle selection system . The laser-assisted needle angle selection system LNASS , custom fabricate device use Class II pointer similar one use point slides lecture . Objectives : - To compare angle difference L-NASS ( Method A ) standard method ( clinician intuition/conventional method ) - To compare angle difference B-NASS ( Method B ) standard method ( clinician intuition ) - To compare angle difference mobile device-NASS MD-NASS ( C ) standard method ( clinician intuition/conventional method ) Eligibility : - Ages Eligible Study : 18 Years old - Genders Eligible Study : Both - Inclusion : - Must undergo schedule CT-guided biopsy . - Must ability follow breathe instruction like hold breath ( procedure perform without general anesthesia ) . - Exclusion : - No serious concurrent medical illness would preclude patient make rational informed decision participation . - Any known allergy plastic polymer ( since Ultem polymer could theoretically induce rash patient , even though hypoallergenic ) . - Pacemakers automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator . - Gross body weight CT table limit ( 450 pound ) . Design : - Primary outcome measure first arm : -- The difference plan achieve needle angle laser-assisted needle angle selection system standard method ( clinician intuition conventional method ) CT-guided biopsy . - Primary outcome measure second arm : -- The difference plan achieve needle angle block pre-drilled needle angle standard method ( clinician intuition conventional method ) CT-guided biopsy - Primary outcome third arm : -- The difference plan achieve needle angle mobile device-assisted needle angle selection system standard method ( clinician 's intuition conventional method ) CT-guided biopsy . - The tool measure needle angle FDA-approved electromagnetic tracking system , track needle movement position . - These comparison do bystander study . - Needle guidance system use initially select angle superficial , shallow needle insertion skin surface ( le 1 cm deep ) . - At time needle enter tissue otherwise enter none system use perform biopsy time . - The key portion procedure alter substantive way .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must fulfill follow criterion eligible study admission : All patient must undergo CTguided biopsy . Age great 18 year . No serious concurrent medical illness would preclude patient make rational informed decision participation . The ability understand willingness sign write informed consent form , comply protocol . If question , ethic consult obtain . Ability follow breathe instruction like hold breath ( procedure perform without general anesthesia ) . Patients must actively enrol NIH protocol schedule CTguided biopsy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients alter mental status precludes understand consent biopsy procedure exclude study . Patients unlikely able hold reasonably still procedure table length procedure . Patients know allergy plastic polymer ( since Ultem polymer could theoretically induce rash patient , even though hypoallergenic ) . Inability follow breathe instruction , without general anesthesia . Patients pacemaker automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator . Gross body weight CT table limit ( 450 pound ) .</criteria>
