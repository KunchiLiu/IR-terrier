	<brief_title>Study Everolimus ( RAD001 ) Combination With Lenalidomide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study study combination two anticancer drug , everolimus ( RAD001 ) lenalidomide patient whose cancer longer respond standard treatment patient unable tolerate standard treatment cancer . The investigator seek establish safety take two medication together determine appropriate dos two drug give together well identify potential side effect drug administer together . Another purpose study find medication work patient 's kind cancer side effect combination RAD001 lenalidomide look patient 's response treatment . The investigator want find effect , good bad , drug patient 's cancer . This study also look specific substance call biomarkers patient 's blood tumor tissue involve growth tumor cell determine level biomarkers related patient 's response treatment development side effect . An expansion cohort currently enrol patient adenoidcystic carcinoma , neuroendocrine kidney cancer .</detailed_description>
