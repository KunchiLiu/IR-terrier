	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate safety delivery ALD-401 intracarotid infusion ass efficacy treatment subject unilateral , predominately cortical , ischemic stroke middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) . ALD-401 make stroke patient 's bone marrow infuse 13-19 day stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study ALD-401 Via Intracarotid Infusion Ischemic Stroke Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , sham-controlled , multi-center , parallel-group , study male female subject , design determine safety efficacy ALD-401 treating primary ischemic stroke . Approximately 100 subject randomize 3:2 within site treatment sham control arm . Subjects experience ischemic stroke undergo either bone marrow sham harvest day 11-17 dosed ALD-401 sham procedure 13-19 day primary event . Bone marrow cell process , sort formulated 3 mL suspension ALD-401 . Two day harvest , subject ALD-401 group process bone marrow cell ( ALD-401 ) inject via intracarotid/MCA infusion , control subject sham infusion . All subject follow 12 month monitor safety ass mental physical function . This study seek demonstrate safety ALD-401 derive autologous bone marrow give via intracarotid delivery therapeutic window 13-19 day post primary stroke event . This dose window select allow post-stroke inflammatory response recede therefore minimize impact resident inflammatory cell administration ALD-401 . This dose window consistent information derive pre-clinical model . Intracarotid/MCA delivery may offer minimal loss dilution therapeutic cell prior localization around ischemic area brain . ALD-401 manufacture patient 's bone marrow harvest 11-17 day primary stroke event .</detailed_description>
