	<brief_summary>The goal prospective , observational study investigate clinical , psychosocial , patient satisfaction outcomes patient undergo perforator flap reconstruction breast reconstruction and/or vascularized lymph node transfer ( VLNTx ) treatment lymphedema . The investigator hypothesize ( 1 ) perforator flap breast reconstruction result excellent clinical , psychosocial , patient satisfaction outcome compare non-perforator flap breast reconstruction ; ( 2 ) perforator flap breast reconstruction associate less persistent postsurgical pain form breast reconstruction , even control major cofactor , extent auxiliary lymph node dissection use radiation therapy ; ( 3 ) perforator flap reconstruction treatment Lymphedema ( i.e. , VLNTx ) result reduction symptom complication lymphedema .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcomes After Perforator Flap Reconstruction Breast Reconstruction and/or Lymphedema Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer serious health issue affect 1 8 woman . Although numerous treatment arise recent year aggressively combat disease increase survivorship , many survivor develop cripple condition result devastate physical psychological impairment . Breast reconstruction method may help recovery psychologically . However , individual still report experience pain follow recovery surgery . Additionally , secondary lymphedema common yet poorly understood complication breast cancer patient . For individual undergo axillary lymph node dissection rate incidence lymphedema approach 47 % . These rate tend increase patient receive irradiation treatment mastectomy . Currently know cure lymphedema . Current treatment include non-invasive measure well surgical intervention . Vascularized lymph node transfer ( VLNTx ) fairly recent surgical procedure show promising result . The goal research study analyze clinical outcome subject undergo breast reconstruction perforator flap and/or VLNTx use information collect part standard care . Clinical data collect prospectively . All subject undergo surgical procedure complete online persistent postsurgical pain assessment questionnaire . The BreastQ questionnaire complete patient prior undergoing breast reconstruction and/or lymphedema treatment .</detailed_description>
