	<brief_summary>Background : - Belinostat experimental cancer treatment drug work help turn gene limit cell growth survival tumor switch cancer cell . Belinostat give patient different type cancer measure safety effectiveness , give formal trial cancer patient abnormal liver function . Because belinostat process liver , safety effectiveness need establish individual abnormal liver function . Researchers interested comparing effect belinostat cancer treatment drug individual normal abnormal liver function . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness belinostat individual solid tumor lymphomas also abnormal liver function . - To compare result belinostat treatment individual normal abnormal liver function . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose solid tumor lymphomas responded standard treatment . - Individuals normal liver function vary degree abnormal liver function ( mild , moderate , severe ) eligible . Design : - Participants screen full medical history physical examination , well blood urine test , tumor image study . Participants divide study group base liver function . - Participants receive belinostat cycle treatment . Except cycle 1 , cycle last 21 day . Cycle 1 last 28 day . For cycle 1 , participant receive single dose belinostat 1 week regular 21-day treatment cycle start . - In cycle , participant receive belinostat day 5 day , ask keep medication diary record side effect . - Participants regular clinic visit blood urine sample image study evaluate cancer response treatment . - Participants may continue take belinostat long cancer respond treatment ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Belinostat Solid Tumors Lymphomas Patients With Varying Degrees Hepatic Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Belinostat histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor . HDACs frequently deregulate cancer cell , lead increase deacetylation silence gene normally control cell cycle arrest apoptosis . - Belinostat growth inhibitory activity several malignancy vitro vivo , single agent combination chemotherapeutic agent . Several Phase I II clinical trial conduct date patient solid tumor hematologic malignancy ; belinostat generally well tolerate . - Belinostat metabolize liver therefore , safety dose belinostat need establish patient vary degree hepatic dysfunction . Objectives : - Establish safety tolerability belinostat give day 1 5 21-day cycle patient vary degree liver dysfunction . - Define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend dose belinostat give day 1 5 21-day cycle patient vary degree liver dysfunction . - Evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) one dose belinostat ( 400 mg/m ( 2 ) ) patient vary degree liver dysfunction . - Obtain preliminary evidence anti-tumor activity tolerable dos belinostat patient vary degree liver dysfunction . - Determine polymorphism UGT1A1 28 allele correlate observe toxicity PK belinostat patient vary degree liver dysfunction . - Measure direct versus indirect bilirubin level correlate observe toxicity , PK . Eligibility : -Adults solid tumor lymphomas whose disease progress standard therapy acceptable standard treatment option . Patients normal vary degree hepatic dysfunction ( mild , moderate , severe ) eligible . Study Design : -Patients divide 4 cohort base level liver dysfunction . Belinostat administer IV 30 minute . On day -7 ( Cycle 1 ) , patient receive single dose 400 mg/m ( 2 ) belinostat . On day 1 5 cycle , patient receive belinostat dose dependent level hepatic dysfunction ( see ) . The total length Cycle 1 28 day ; cycle 21 day . No 12 patient normal hepatic function accrue .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically cytologically confirm ( original diagnosis subsequent recurrence progression ) solid tumor lymphoma metastatic , unresectable , progressive , recurrent , standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . No radiation , major surgery , chemotherapy biologic therapy within 4 week prior enter study ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) ; great equal 2 week since prior administration study drug exploratory IND/Phase 0 study . ( also refer `` early Phase I study '' `` prePhase I study '' subtherapeutic dose drug administer ) PI 's discretion . Patients must recover least eligibility level due adverse event and/or toxicity prior chemotherapy biologic therapy . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use belinostat patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric Phase I singleagent trial . ECOG performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 60 percent . Life expectancy great 3 month . Patients must acceptable renal marrow function define : leukocyte great equal 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL platelet great equal 100,000/mcL serum creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min patient creatinine level institutional normal , determine measure 24hour creatinine clearance Baseline evaluation conduct within 7 day treatment start date . Patients abnormal liver function eligible . Patients active hemolysis exclude . No distinction make liver dysfunction due metastasis liver dysfunction due cause . Patients biliary obstruction stent place eligible , provide stent place least 10 day prior first dose belinostat liver function stabilize . Two measurement least 2 day apart put patient hepatic dysfunction stratum accept evidence stable hepatic function . There evidence biliary sepsis . Patients gliomas brain metastasis require corticosteroids anticonvulsant must stable dose corticosteroid seizure free 1 month prior enrollment . Patients know brain metastasis brain irradiation ( whole brain gamma knife ) 4 week start protocol . Note patient steroid taper low dose ( i.e. , &lt; 1.5 mg dexamethasone/day ) . The effect belinostat develop human fetus unknown . For reason HDAC inhibitor know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Prior therapy belinostat . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition belinostat , include hydroxamate compound arginine . Patients take valproic acid , another HDAC inhibitor , least 2 week prior enrollment . Patients uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study belinostat HDAC inhibitor potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother belinostat , breastfeed discontinue mother treated belinostat . HIV positive patient retroviral therapy exclude cohort 1 , normal liver function cohort . HIV positive patient retroviral therapy exclude cohort 24 confound effect potential complication HIV opportunistic infection . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential increase risk liver dysfunction antiretroviral therapy potential PK interaction belinostat . Appropriate study undertake group patient indicate . Patients significant cardiovascular disease ( New York Heart Association Class III IV cardiac disease ) , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within past 6 month , unstable angina , unstable arrhythmia need antiarrhythmic therapy ( use frequency adjust medication atrial fibrillation allow , stable medication least last month prior initiation belinostat treatment medication list cause Torsades de Points ) , evidence acute ischemia ECG . Marked baseline prolongation QT/QTc interval , e.g. , repeat demonstration QTc interval &gt; 450 msec ; Long QT Syndrome ; require use concomitant medication may cause Torsades de Pointes .</criteria>
