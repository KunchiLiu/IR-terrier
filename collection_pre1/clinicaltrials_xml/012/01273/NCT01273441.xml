	<brief_summary>Helicobacter pylori main cause chronic gastritis , peptic ulcer gastric tumor ( adenocarcinoma lymphoma ) . The cure H. pylori infection prevents recurrence duodenal gastric ulcer improve dyspepsia significant proportion case , cost-effective . Eradication therapy change time . The usually recommended pattern consensus conference traditionally triple therapy , compose combination 2 antibiotic ( clarithromycin plus amoxicillin metronidazole ) proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) 7-14 day . Recent meta-analyses current global eradication rate standard triple therapy le 80 % . Several European study find even low eradication rate , 35-40 % case result treatment failure . Treatment failure lead second treatment new diagnostic test confirm eradication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Sequential Concomitant Therapy Helicobacter Pylori Eradication Routine Clinical Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Justification study : One late therapeutic innovation sequential therapy , introduce Italy Zullo et al . The drug delivery strategy involve 5-day induction phase dual therapy ( PPI every 12 hour amoxicillin 1g every 12 hour ) , follow immediately triple therapy 5 day PPI every 12 hour , metronidazole 500 mg every 12 hour clarithromycin 500 mg every 12 hour . Sequential therapy prove effectiveness standard triple therapy seven ten day . In order ass efficacy new treatment area , past year conduct multicentre observational pilot study routine clinical practice condition patient infect H. pylori indication eradication . 139 patient 6 different centre include . Excellent treatment compliance minimal side effect , similar describe triple therapy , show . The result confirm similar efficacy obtain previous study eradication rate significantly higher obtained classic triple therapy area . Several previous study show excellent efficacy quadruple therapy PPI , amoxicillin , clarithromycin metronidazole , administer `` concomitantly '' drug sequential therapy , 5-7 day . Several study find high eradication rate `` concomitant '' therapy compare classic triple therapy . The result randomize study sequential concomitant therapy compare recently report American Congress Gastroenterology . Eradication adverse event rate similar treatment . This data suggest `` sequentially '' administration drug probably complicate unnecessarily treatment . Therefore necessary make control clinical trial directly compare `` sequential '' versus `` concomitant '' therapy . The result study conclude first line treatment H. pylorus eradication .</detailed_description>
