	<brief_summary>Background : - Medically intractable epilepsy term use describe epilepsy control medication . Many people whose seizure respond medication respond surgical treatment , relieve seizure completely almost completely one-half two-thirds patient qualify surgery . The test surgery perform part treatment experimental , researcher interested training neurologist neurosurgeon epilepsy surgery care order well understand epilepsy treatment . Objectives : - To use surgery treatment medically intractable epilepsy child adult . Eligibility : - Children adult least 8 year age simple complex partial seizure ( seizure come one area brain ) respond medication , willing brain surgery treat medically intractable epilepsy . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical examination , neurological examination . Imaging study , include magnetic resonance image computer-assisted tomography ( CT ) , may also conduct part screen . Participants need surgery whose epilepsy treat surgically follow primary care physician neurologist need return National Institutes Health study . - Prior surgery , participant follow procedure provide information correct surgical approach . - Video electroencephalography monitoring measure brain activity normal activity within 24-hour period . Three four 15-minute break allow within period . - Wada test evaluate speech , comprehension , memory center brain , use contrast dye study blood vessel brain short-term anesthetic administration procedure test effect area speech memory . - Depth electrodes and/or brain surface electrode measure brain activity determine part brain responsible seizure ( seizure focus ) . - Participants surgical procedure site seizure focus . Brain lesion , abnormal blood vessel , tumor , infection , area brain abnormality either remove treated way stop help prevent spread seizure without affect irreplaceable brain function , ability speak , understand , move , feel , see . - Participants return outpatient visit brain image study 2 month , 1 year , 2 year surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective This protocol perform study normal human biology disease pathogenesis ( natural history ) patient medically intractable epilepsy , 2 ) provide standard surgical treatment medically intractable epilepsy , 3 ) follow course patient epilepsy surgery , 4 ) investigate neurophysiological correlate human cognitive process memory , learning , attention , language , perception , action , 5 ) provide invasive monitoring patient tumor related epilepsy . Neurophysiologic recording compare rest awake state sleep.. Any treatment protocol base current standard care epilepsy surgery . Study Population Patients 8 year old whose seizure uncontrollable medication may participate study well patient tumor relate epilepsy invasive monitoring indicate . Study Design Patients screen study neurologist confirm diagnosis medically intractable epilepsy . Patients confirm diagnosis medically intractable epilepsy offer evaluation protocol 01-N-0139 , Evaluation Treatment Patients Epilepsy . Patients confirm medically intractable epilepsy offer standard invasive non-invasive diagnostic surgical procedure . Diagnostic invasive monitoring intracranial electrode localization seizure focus may require . The ultimate goal surgically remove modify epileptic focus . Standard procedures perform 1 ) anterior temporal lobectomy 2 ) amygdalohippocampectomy temporal lobe epilepsy , 3 ) focal cortical resection epilepsy arises outside temporal lobe , 4 ) removal brain lesion cause epilepsy , 5 ) multiple subpial transection . In patient invasive monitoring medically necessary , neurophysiologic activity cognitive task capture intracranial surface depth electrode . Analysis focus role neuronal firing aggregate neural activity 1 ) cognitive function , 2 ) state wakefulness sleep , 3 ) period time surround seizure activity . Medically Intractable Epilepsy Patients medically intractable epilepsy follow two year surgical procedure receive standard neurological examination MRI evaluation brain . Patients surgical resection epileptogenic tissue complete participation three-month post-op visit . Participants protocol evaluate potential eligibility NINDS clinical trial . Tumor Related epilepsy Patients tumor relate epilepsy enrol protocol clinical indication arise participation seperate protocol , 16-N-0041 Tumor Related Epilepsy . Patients complete participation three-month post-op visit . Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure patient medically intractable epilepsy change seizure frequency , measure Engel scale 1 year treatment . Secondary outcome measure include 1 ) percentage patient able completely withdrawn anti-epileptic medication ; 2 ) percentage patient seizure-free ( Engel Class I ) ; 3 ) mean Engel Class one year surgery stratify type surgical procedure ; 4 ) percentage patient permanent neurological side-effects surgical treatment ; 5 ) incidence serious complication epileptic seizure , 6 ) neurophysiological correlate cognitive function . Outcomes patient tumor relate epilepsy assess seperate protocol , 16-N-0041 , Tumor Related Epilepsy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible entry study , candidate must meet following criterion : 1 . Be 8 year age old medically intractable epilepsy tumor relate epilepsy . 2 . Have simple complex partial seizure . 3 . Seizures must persist despite medical therapy ( medically intractable epilepsy ) seizures must associate presence brain tumor . 4 . Able give inform consent , parent able provide inform consent child . 5 . Agree undergo brain surgery indicate treat medically intractable epilepsy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Candidates exclude : 1 . Are pregnant ( woman childbearing age test urine pregnancy test agree avoid pregnant practice reliable form contraception abstinence sexual intercourse undergo evaluation epilepsy surgery 1 month epilepsy surgery ) . 2 . Can MRI scan . 3 . Have bleed disorder correct invasive testing surgery , medical condition would make test surgery unsafe , lung cardiac disease would increase risk general anesthesia severe immunodeficiency systemic cancer relate brain lesion .</criteria>
