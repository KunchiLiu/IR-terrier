In hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , BO think manifestation chronic graft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) . Up 45 percent patient undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation NHLBI develop decline pulmonary function . Conventional therapy patient develop BO consist augmentation systemic immunosuppressant . Systemic immunosuppression limit efficacy BO associate deleterious consequence include increase risk infection decrease graft-versus tumor/leukemia effect . Recently , cyclosporine inhalation solution ( CIS ) solution propylene glycol show improve overall survival chronic rejection-free survival lung transplant patient . These finding suggest target delivery immunosuppressive therapy diseased organ warrant investigation may minimize morbidity associate systemic immunosuppression . However , currently exist limited data regard overall efficacy inhale cyclosporine treat establish BO follow lung transplantation . Furthermore , inhale cyclosporine study treatment BO follow hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Here , propose evaluate long-term safety efficacy , inhaled CIS treatment BO . Enrollment offer subject complete end study ( week 18 visit ) initial protocol ( Phase II Trial CIS lung transplant hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient treatment Bronchiolitis Obliterans ) show evidence benefit ( either improvement stabilization ) BO/BOS CIS treatment . Clinical parameter , include pulmonary function test , measure addition laboratory marker anti-inflammatory response CIS . Adverse event associate extended treatment CIS record . The primary objective provide long-term safety efficacy data use CIS hematopoietic transplant patient lung transplant patient establish BO . Secondary objective include investigation inflammatory pathway lead chronic BO ascertainment long term anti-inflammatory effect CSA preparation ex vivo vivo . Primary endpoint efficacy extend use CIS BO/BOS . Secondary endpoint include toxicity profile ( adverse event ) , improvement high resolution chest CT image , result peripheral blood bronchoalveolar cytokine array assess secondary marker inflammation , functional capacity measurement use six-minute walk test .</brief_summary>
