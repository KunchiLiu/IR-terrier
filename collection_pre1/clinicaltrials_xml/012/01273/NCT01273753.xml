	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine impact exercise dialysis use objective measure fluid status determination , specifically bioimpedance analysis ( BIA ) blood volume monitoring ( BVM ) . We hypothesize exercise dialysis associate stable blood pressure reflect different output BIA BVM monitoring .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Achieving dry weight ( DW ) essential optimal health dialysis patient . Despite one basic important factor management hemodialysis patient , many obstacle achieve DW . One problem underlie optimal fluid status management lie clinical assessment use determine DW . The current standard clinical judgment often reactive ( ie . set weight patient develop hypotension cramp ) instead goal direct ( ie . try achieve define target measure ) . Moreover , DW dynamic parameter change patient time , ongoing assessment remain reactive change clinical status instead proactively base monitoring validated measure . A primary impediment achieve DW relatively short time dialysis limit vascular refill leading complication hypotension adverse sequela relatively rapid volume removal . The evaluation intervention aim improve symptom prevent complication scientifically strengthen objective assessment patient 's volume . Fortunately two objective clinically validated tool assess volume status emerge : bioimpedance ( BIA ) allow assessment patient 's hydration status blood volume monitoring ( BVM ) allow direct measure rate vascular refill dialysis . These essential understanding impact therapeutic intervention direct improve achievement DW . The next important consideration select intervention show promise assist patient achieve DW . While many intervention deserve careful analysis select exercise additional cardiovascular benefit exercise , fits outpatient program part achieve overall outpatient wellness objective . To end propose follow specific aim : Specific Aim : Systematically evaluate effect exercise hemodynamic stability achievement dry weight test follow hypothesis . Hypothesis 1 : Exercise bike rid dialysis improve vascular refilling determine BVM . Hypothesis 2 : Exercise bike rid dialysis improves ( lead reduction ) tissue hydration status determine BIA . Hypothesis 3 : Improved intra-dialytic blood pressure stability directly relate improved vascular refilling assess BVM , turn relate improve ( reduce ) tissue hydration assess BIA . Hypothesis 4 : Intravascular refilling ( assessed BVM ) directly relate reduction tissue hydration ( assess BIA ) .</detailed_description>
