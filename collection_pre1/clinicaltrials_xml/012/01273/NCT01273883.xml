	<detailed_description>Descriptions tinnitus date back time ancient Egypt , yet science fail unravel mysterious underlie mechanism produce subjective auditory perception sound . These perception may manifestations damage result noise exposure , ototoxicity , abnormal condition auditory system . However , many individual idiopathic tinnitus specific cause determine . Although often present conjunction hearing loss , magnitude hear loss necessarily correspond severity tinnitus . In addition , individual report tinnitus experience concomitant hyperacusis . This relationship suggest process may link underlying imbalance level hair cell . The possible influence magnesium ( Mg ) antagonist , calcium , discussed literature contribute factor mitigation noise-induced hearing loss , ototoxicity , hyperexcitability auditory system . Permanent temporary change auditory function link nutritional deficiency magnesium . Mg deficiency result increased susceptibility noise-induced hearing loss , ototoxicity , hyperexcitability auditory system . The recommended daily allowance ( RDA ) Mg adult 4.5 mg/kg ; however , age group Americans fall short RDA Mg 100 mg daily . This lack appropriate magnesium intake may negative consequence . For example , putative Mg mechanism within auditory system involve metabolic cellular cascade event . Specifically , Mg deficiency lead increase permeability calcium channel hair cell consequent over-influx calcium , increase release glutamate via exocytosis , overstimulation N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor auditory nerve fiber . Recent study noise-induced hearing loss idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss suggest Mg supplementation may lessen severity tinnitus patient . Mg improve hearing recovery lessen tinnitus patient idiopathic sudden hearing loss . More recently , well-controlled study Mg relatively safe convenient adjunct corticosteroid treatment enhance improvement hear acute-onset sensorineural hearing loss dose 4 g. The protective effect Mg noise-induced hearing loss previously report . Despite encouraging finding , control study examine effect Mg supplementation subject moderate severe tinnitus . In study subject make 4 visit clinic 2 month . At first visit , subject hear test . Prior begin round supplement , subject ask rate severity tinnitus 1-10 scale , complete Tinnitus Handicap Inventory ( THI ) questionnaire . Subjects randomize 1 2 group . One group begin 532 mg Mg 25 day , group begin placebo supplement 25 day . At visit 2 , subject hear test , rat tinnitus , complete THI questionnaire well Treatment Period Survey . Subjects take supplement 2 week , return visit 3 . At Visit 3 , subject hear test , rat tinnitus , complete THI questionnaire take opposite supplement ( placebo Mg ) 25 day . At Visit 4 , subject hear test , rat tinnitus , complete THI questionnaire well Treatment Period Survey .</detailed_description>
