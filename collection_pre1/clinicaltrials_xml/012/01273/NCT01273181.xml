	<brief_summary>Background : - MAGE-A3/12 type protein commonly find certain type cancer cell , particularly metastatic cancer . Researchers develop process take lymphocyte ( white blood cell ) cancer patient , modify laboratory target cancer cell contain MAGE-A3/12 , return patient help attack kill cancer cell . These modify white blood cell experimental treatment , researcher interest determine safety effectiveness possible treatment cancer involve MAGE-A3/12 . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness anti-MAGE-A3/12 lymphocyte treatment metastatic cancer respond standard treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose metastatic melanoma , renal cell cancer , another type metastatic cancer respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen full medical history physical examination , well blood urine test , tumor sample , image study . - Participants leukapheresis collect enough white blood cell modification laboratory . - Seven day start anti-MAGE-A3/12 treatment , participant chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludarabine suppress immune system preparation treatment . - After last dose chemotherapy , participant receive anti-MAGE-A3/12 cell infusion 20 30 minute , follow dose interleukin-2 keep anti-MAGE-A3/12 cell alive active long possible . Participants also receive filgrastim encourage production blood cell . - Participants remain hospital monitor possible side effect , release hospital regular followup exam blood sample image study evaluate effectiveness treatment ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MAGE-A3/12 Metastatic Cancer Treatment With Anti-MAGE-A3/12 TCR-Gene Engineered Lymphocytes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background We construct single retroviral vector contain alpha beta chain T cell receptor ( TCR ) recognize MAGE-A3/12 tumor antigen , use mediate genetic transfer TCR high efficiency ( &gt; 30 % ) without need perform selection . In co-cultures human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A serotype group ( HLA-A2 ) MAGE-A3/12 double positive tumor , anti-MAGE-A3/12 TCR transduce T cell secrete significant amount Interferon ( IFN ) -gamma high specificity . Objectives : Primary objective : - Determine administration anti-MAGE-A3/12 engineer peripheral blood lymphocyte aldesleukin patient follow nonmyeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic cancer express MAGE-A3/12 antigen . - Determine toxicity profile treatment regimen Secondary objective : -Determine vivo survival TCR gene-engineered cell . Eligibility : Patients human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -A*0201 positive 18 year age old must : - metastatic cancer whose tumor express MAGE-A3/12 antigen ; - previously receive non-responder recur follow standard care metastatic disease ; Patients may : -contraindications high dose aldesleukin administration . Design : PBMC obtain leukapheresis ( approximately 10^10 ) cell ) culture presence anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) aldesleukin order stimulate T-cell growth . Transduction initiate exposure approximately 10^7 5 X 10^8 cell retroviral vector supernatant contain anti-MAGE-A3/12 TCR gene . The study begin evaluate safety two range cell , 5 x 10^9 - 3 x 10^10 , great 3 x 10^10- 1 x 10^11 standard phase I dose escalation fashion use 3+3 design . Once safety confirm , patient enrol phase 2 portion trial use 1 x 10^11 cell . In phase 2 portion , patient enter two cohort base histology : cohort 1 include patient metastatic melanoma renal cell cancer ; cohort 2 include patient type metastatic cancer . Patients receive nonmyeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow intravenous infusion ex vivo tumor reactive , TCR gene-transduced peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) plus intravenous ( IV ) aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg every ( q ) 8h maximum 15 dos ) . Patients undergo complete evaluation tumor physical examination , compute tomography ( CT ) chest , abdomen pelvis clinical laboratory evaluation four six week treatment . If patient stable disease ( SD ) tumor shrinkage , repeat complete evaluation perform every 1-3 month . After first year , patient continue respond continue follow evaluation every 3-4 month study criterion meet . For 2 stratum evaluate phase 2 portion , study conduct use phase II optimal design initially 21 evaluable patient enrol . For two arm trial , 0 1 21 patient experience clinical response , patient enrol 2 first 21 evaluable patient enrol clinical response , accrual continue total 41 evaluable patient enrol stratum . For stratum , objective determine combination high dose aldesleukin , lymphocyte deplete chemotherapy , anti-MAGE-A3/12 TCR-gene engineer lymphocyte able associated clinical response rate rule 5 % ( p0=0.05 ) favor modest 20 % partial response ( PR ) + complete response ( CR ) rate ( p1=0.20 ) .</detailed_description>
