	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect well lapatinib ditosylate trastuzumab work treat old patient human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -positive breast cancer spread start nearby tissue lymph node ( locally advance ) part body ( metastatic ) . Lapatinib ditosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill tumor cancer-killing substance . Giving lapatinib ditosylate together trastuzumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tolerability Combination Lapatinib Trastuzumab Adults Age 60 Older With HER2 Positive Locally Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate safety tolerability combination trastuzumab lapatinib ( lapatinib ditosylate ) adult age 60 old locally advanced metastatic breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe full toxicity profile include grade ; estimate rate grade cardiac toxicity ; estimate rate grade diarrhea , nausea , vomit . II . To describe pharmacokinetic parameter lapatinib old adult . III . To estimate objective response rate clinical benefit rate define modify Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . IV . To estimate median progression-free overall survival . V. To explore factor chronological age affect toxicity rate identify use cancer-specific geriatric assessment . VI . To estimate rate adherence lapatinib old adult . OUTLINE : Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) trastuzumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute weekly OR every 3 week . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
