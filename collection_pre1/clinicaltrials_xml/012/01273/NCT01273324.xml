	<brief_summary>The dual mobility design concept acetabular liner , use Restoration ADM Acetabular System , apply various implant since introduction Gilles Bousquet France 1976 . Dual mobility cup show good clinical result particularly laud low incidence dislocation . However , wear performance design concept proven date . As wear particle possible contribute factor aseptic loosening , assessment wear fixation important step prove implant design . The propose study combine RSA peri-prosthetic bone mineral density well outcome questionnaire provide complete vivo evaluation prosthesis fixation , polyethylene wear , objective subjective outcome Restoration ADM Acetabular System .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiostereometric Analysis ( RSA ) DEXA Evaluate Fixation Wear Restoration ADM Acetabular System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Question 1 : ) Do implant component Restoration ADM Acetabular System achieve adequate fixation underlie bone ? Null Hypothesis : There significant increase micromotion implant component 1 year indicate adequate long-term fixation implant - bone interface . Alternative Hypothesis : There significant increase micromotion implant component 1 year indicate inadequate fixation implant - bone interface . b ) What migration pattern ( translation rotation ) Restoration ADM Acetabular System component first three year postoperatively ? c ) For proportion implant migration continue increase three year follow-up ? ) Are inducible displacement , measure weight-bearing follow-up exam , consistent time indicate adequate fixation achieve ? e ) Are significant difference migration pattern ( translation rotation ) Restoration ADM Acetabular System components implant previously study RSA report literature ? Question 2 : ) How much femoral head wear polyethylene liner ? b ) How much backside wear occur polyethylene liner ? c ) How total wear compare implant previously report literature ? Question 3 : Does polyethylene liner demonstrate mobile bear property ? Question 4 : ) Are changes time bone mineral density peri-prosthetic bone Restoration ADM Acetabular System component ? b ) Where change bone mineral density occur ? Question 5 : Does total hip arthroplasty use Restoration ADM Acetabular System result significant improvement health status functional outcome ?</detailed_description>
