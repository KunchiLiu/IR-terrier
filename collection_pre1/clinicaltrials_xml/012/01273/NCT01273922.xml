Als3 ( antigen NDV-3 investigational vaccine ) effective member Als protein family protect mouse challenge either Candida S. aureus . This Phase I study evaluate safety immunogenicity two dos administer 6 month apart NDV-3 vaccine two dose level . At least 40 subject enrol study two group approximately 20 subject . Each group randomize 15 receive NDV-3 vaccine 5 receive placebo . All injection administer intramuscularly . One group receive low dose NDV-3 ten-fold high dose . Subjects follow-up visit assess safety , tolerability immune response day 3 , 7 , 14 , 28 , 90 180 first vaccination compare baseline level day 7 , 14 90 second vaccination .</detailed_description>
