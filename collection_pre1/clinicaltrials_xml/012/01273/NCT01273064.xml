	<detailed_description>Placebo control , double-blind , multicenter study utilize Standard Care ( SOC ) combination CTS-1027 genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C ( HCV ) patient null-responders previous SOC therapy ( y ) . Null-responders define patient fail achieve great 2 log drop HCV-RNA level 12 week treatment ( know early virologic response EVR ) previous SOC therapy . If , previous SOC treatment , patient &lt; 2 log decline HCV-RNA Week 12 &gt; 2 log decline HCV-RNA time Week 12 Week 24 , patient null-responder exclude study participation . If , previous SOC treatment , Week 12 HCV-RNA obtain , post Week 12 response must &lt; 2 log decline ( still HCV-RNA positive ) order patient define null-responder . Patients screen 4 week qualify study entry . During screen period , clinical laboratory test perform . At Week 0/Day 1 , patient undergo centralize , stratify ( base ethnicity ) , randomization one four treatment arm : SOC + one three dose CTS-1027 SOC + placebo . Study treatment last 24 , 48 , 60 week , base patient 's response study treatment . The Principal Investigators , site personnel , patient blind HCV-RNA result first 12 week therapy . At Week 12 , study treatment blind broken study 's Interactive Web Randomization System ( IWRS ) . However , Principal Investigators , investigative site personnel , patient , Sponsor remain blinded treatment allocation Week 24 ( see ) . The patient SOC + placebo arm continue treatment follow : - Patients SOC + placebo achieve least 2 log decline HCV-RNA Week 12 automatically rolled-over SOC + 15 mg CTS-1027 twice day ( BID ) arm . The treatment duration patient 60 week ( i.e. , 12 week SOC + placebo , follow 48 week SOC + 15 mg BID ) . - Those patient SOC + placebo achieve ≥ 2 log decline Week 12 continue SOC therapy Week 48 . Patients SOC + CTS-1027 arm continue treatment regimen initial 24 week regardless HCV-RNA change . At Week 24 , study blind formally break . Patients continue study follow : - Patients SOC + CTS-1027 arm achieve ≥ 2 log HCV-RNA decline Week 24 continue treatment regimen assign Double-Blind Phase additional 24 week . - Patients SOC + CTS-1027 15 mg BID SOC + CTS-1027 30 mg BID arm achieve &lt; 2 log HCV-RNA decline Week 24 escalate next high dose CTS-1027 additional 24 week . - Patients SOC + CTS-1027 60 mg BID arm achieve least 2 log HCV-RNA decline Week 24 discontinue study . All patient see 4 12 week ( Follow-Up Period ) end treatment . If patient 's HCV-RNA undetectable end treatment , he/she see additional follow-up visit 24 week end treatment .</detailed_description>
