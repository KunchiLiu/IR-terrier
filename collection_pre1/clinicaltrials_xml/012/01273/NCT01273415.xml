	<brief_summary>Gene expression study identify least four molecularly distinct subtypes breast cancer include two biologically distinct ER-positive subtypes breast cancer : luminal A luminal B ( luminal B tumor poorer outcomes luminal A tumor ) . Although luminal B tumor identify expression HER2 , major biological distinction luminal A B proliferation signature , include gene CCNB1 , MKI67 , MYBL2 , high expression luminal B tumor luminal A tumor . The high cost gene expression profile limited incorporation general clinical practice . To date , available IHC-based surrogate assay distinguish luminal A luminal B tumor . We hypothesize IHC determination Ki67 index well ER , PgR , HER2 status able distinguish luminal B subtype breast cancer luminal A subgroup .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gene expression study identify five molecularly distinct subtypes breast cancer prognostic value across multiple treatment setting include tow biologically distinct estrogen receptor ( ER ) -positive subtypes breast cancer : luminal A luminal B.The expression ER-associated gene characterize luminal breast cancer , luminal B tumor poorer outcome luminal tumor . Although luminal B tumor identify expression HER2 , major biological distinction luminal A B proliferation signature , include gene CCNB1 , MKI67 , MYBL2 , high expression luminal B tumor luminal A tumors.Therefore , distinction luminal A B tumor base proliferation status among ER-positive luminal patient may important breast cancer biology prognosis . The high cost gene expression profile limited incorporation randomize clinical trial , thus , DNA microarray-defined proliferation status use provide prognostic information general practice . Although Ki67 gene may prognostic value , evaluation marker adjuvant setting raise conflict , absence standardize test Ki67 , difficult draw firm conclusion trials.As result , Ki67 use assign patient specific treatment risk group . Yet despite great uncertainty , panel expert St. Gallen Consensus 2009 propose ( 1 ) classify tumor low , intermediate , high proliferative potential correspond Ki67 label index value less equal 15 % , 16-30 % , 30 % , respectively , ( 2 ) use Ki67 label index criterion select add chemotherapy endocrine therapy HR-positive BCs . Since proliferation uniformly high basal-like HER2 cancer variable within ER-positive cancer , great practical prognostic value proliferative index seem within ER-positive disease . Decisions regard use adjuvant therapy early operable breast cancer depend array factor predict prognosis therapeutic efficacy . Multigene signatures relate cell proliferation show consistent accuracy clinical characterization hormone receptor ( HR ) -positive BC , hence interest biologic factor predict adjuvant response continue increase . Based consensus , hypothesize large patient population long follow-up , could determine cut-off value Ki67 label index sufficiently sensitive specific identify patient HR-positive luminal BC require addition cytotoxic chemotherapy endocrine treatment . In addition , comparison objective significance level Ki67 value confirm biomarkers ( e.g. , HER2 , estrogen receptor , histologic differentiation ) may clarify value Ki67 biomarker HR-positive luminal BCs .</detailed_description>
