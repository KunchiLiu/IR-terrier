We know recent large national enquiry maternal child death UK , know CEMACH , obesity major risk mother child . When deaths woman pregnancy analyse , obesity come common risk factor . Babies obese mother 3 time likely need admission Neonatal Intensive Care Unit . Traditionally , obesity treat lifestyle measure encourage healthy eat increase physical activity . Unfortunately measure often insufficient produce significant improvement weight . If obese woman gain little even weight pregnancy , outcome pregnancy know improve . This show large study 120 , 000 obese woman . The drug metformin use year treatment diabetes recently polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) . Studies pregnant PCOS woman woman diabetes pregnancy show safe effective . Fortunately relatively cheap take tablet meal . Metformin great advantage cause weight gain often lead small amount weight loss . It work improve body 's sensitivity insulin important resistance insulin common obesity . We lot experience use metformin treat woman diabetes pregnancy greatly beneficial . We wish examine potential obese woman diabetes . We hop show benefit woman cause less weight gain , less high blood pressure , less diabetes .

	<detailed_description>Obesity Pregnancy identify Confidential Enquiry Maternal Child Health [ CEMACH ] report ( 2007 ) major health risk mother baby : - 35 % woman die obese - 30 % mother stillbirth neonatal death obese Obesity increase risk miscarriage , GDM , pregnancy-induced hypertension/PET , Caesarean section , deep venous thrombosis , puerperal sepsis LGA baby . There 5-fold increase cost antenatal care . Results various study conclude limited weight gain pregnancy obese woman result favourable pregnancy outcome . By improve insulin sensitivity enhance GLP-1 release , metformin associate weight reduction approximately 5.8 % serious adverse event . The aim study test hypothesis management obese non-diabetic pregnant woman standardise life-style intervention ( diet physical activity ) plus metformin lead improve maternal perinatal outcome compare life-style intervention alone . The study also seek determine whether metformin improve body fat distribution measure bioimpedance pregnancy particular emphasis metabolic active visceral fat . Genetic study investigate whether patient polymorphisms candidate fat gene , FTO gene , differ response metformin whether associate favourable pregnancy outcomes . This randomise , multicentre , double blind , placebo-controlled trial.Assuming power 90 % , significance level 5 % 2-sided testing , recruit 425 subject per arm trial.This allow detection difference mean centile ( z-score ) 0.21 standard deviation . All woman undergo oral glucose tolerance test book 28 wks ; find GDM 28 week commence home glucose monitor receive metformin glucose value outside target range . The primary outcome birth weight centile ( z score ) . Secondary outcome include maternal neonatal outcome , body composition score , patient satisfaction infant development 2 year . The relation FTO gene variant pregnancy outcomes examine . Parametric non-parametric test use appropriate .
