	<brief_title>A Safety Tolerability Study 42037788 ( Referred CNTO 0007 ) Compared With Placebo Patients Who Have Experienced Ischemic Cerebral Infarction ( Also Known Stroke )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first-in-human ( FIH ) study 42037788 ( refer CNTO 0007 ) , cell therapy test see may useful treat patient ischemic cerebral infarction also know stroke . Patients randomize ( assigned chance ) receive single dose CNTO 0007 placebo ( identical appearance CNTO 0007 contain cell ) intravenous ( IV ) infusion ( injection directly vein ) . Patients study staff know patient assign CNTO 0007 placebo . The study conduct 2 stage ( Stage A Stage B ) . In Stage A , high dose CNTO 0007 cause unacceptable side effect , refer maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine administered patient Stage B study . In Stage A , 5 ( 7 ) cohort ( group ) 4-8 patient administer single IV infusion CNTO 0007 placebo 1-5 day ( depend cohort ) stroke ( first cohort patient receive low dose CNTO 0007 placebo subsequent cohort administer high dose CNTO 0007 placebo MTD determine ) . In Stage B , patient administer single IV infusion MTD within specify number day stroke .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patient suffer ischemic stroke , define protocol ( If woman , must postmenopausal , define menses 18 month study start . Premenopausal , surgicallysterilized woman must negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test screen CNTO 0007 placebo administration ) Patients must able remain inpatient least 3 day postinfusion intensive safety monitoring Patients must receive standard poststroke care infusion begin treatment experimental product , include limited appropriate secondary prevention measure blood pressure cholesterol control antiplatelet agent , unless contraindicate Patient must clinical evidence worsen stroke last 24 hour prior start infusion study treatment Patients must general medical condition consistent expect survival least 1 year . Presence history clinically significant disease , medical condition , treatment intervention determine Investigator Need supplementary oxygen cardiorespiratory reason respirator dependency . If supplementary oxygen need cardiopulmonary reason give routine basis , exclusionary Presence history alcohol drug abuse define 4th edition Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSMIV ) within 1 year screen phase .</criteria>
