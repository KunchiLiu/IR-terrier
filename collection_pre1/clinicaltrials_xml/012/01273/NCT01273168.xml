	<brief_summary>Background : - Some type cancer cell hormone receptor surface need hormone estrogen grow . The drug tamoxifen block estrogen bind tumor cell , help slow stop growth cancer . Tamoxifen approve treatment certain type estrogen-linked cancer , breast ovarian cancer . - The experimental drug Z-Endoxifen HCl ( endoxifen ) relate tamoxifen , show work similar estrogen-linked cancer . In many cancer patient , tamoxifen turn endoxifen enzyme liver ; however , people liver enzymes turn tamoxifen endoxifen , mean drug work properly . Taking certain drug time tamoxifen also keep turn endoxifen . Researchers interested determine whether endoxifen tablet effective slow stop tumor growth individual whose hormone-linked tumor respond standard treatment . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness daily endoxifen individual hormone receptor positive solid tumor respond standard treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose hormone receptor positive solid tumor ( breast tumor ) , desmoid tumor , gynecologic tumor respond standard treatment . Individuals breast cancer must least one prior chemotherapy regimen one prior hormonal regimen metastatic disease . Design : - Participants screen full medical history ( include prior hormone use ) physical examination , well blood urine test , tumor image study , eye examination . - Participants take endoxifen tablet daily 28-day cycle treatment , ask keep medication diary record side effect . - Participants regular clinic visit blood urine sample image study evaluate cancer 's response treatment . - Participants continue take endoxifen long cancer respond treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Genetic polymorphism CYP2D6 concomitant medication alter tamoxifen metabolism , limit exposure active metabolite endoxifen . These factor associate high rate recurrence short disease-free survival breast cancer patient receive tamoxifen . - Administration endoxifen directly patient anticipated bypass effect CYP2D6 polymorphisms concomitant medication provide adequate active drug level treat patient , result clinical benefit . - 16 alpha- [ ( 18 ) F ] -fluoro-17 beta estradiol ( FES ) investigational radiolabeled imaging agent use positron emission tomography ( PET ) investigate tumor estrogen receptor activity OBJECTIVES : - Establish safety tolerability oral endoxifen ( Z-Endoxifen HCl ) administer daily schedule patient refractory hormone receptor positive solid tumor ( breast tumor ) , desmoid tumor , gynecologic tumor . - Establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) oral Z-endoxifen HCl administer daily schedule . - Determine pharmacokinetics oral Z-endoxifen ( HCl form ) . - Evaluate change [ ( 18 ) F ] FES uptake use PET/CT hormone receptor-positive tumor treatment oral Z-endoxifen . ELIGIBILITY : - Adults histologically document hormone receptor positive solid tumor ( breast tumor ) , desmoid tumor , gynecologic tumor . - Patients breast cancer must least one prior chemotherapy regimen one prior hormonal regimen metastatic disease . All patient must disease progressed follow least one line standard therapy . - No major surgery , radiation , hormonal , chemotherapy within 4 week prior study enrollment , recover toxicity prior therapy least eligibility level . - Patients 6-patient expansion cohort MTD ask undergo optional tumor biopsy research purpose . STUDY DESIGN : - Z-endoxifen administered orally day 28-day cycle . - Dose escalation proceed MTD establish target maximum dose ( DL8 ) reach . Six additional patient enter expansion cohort ass pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics - When image agent available , optional FES PET/CT scan perform baseline 1-3 hour Z-endoxifen treatment week 1 cycle 1 . - As relative bioavailability study , 6 patient expansion cohort give single dose free base form Z-endoxifen day 1 continue study take Z-endoxifen HCl ; blood urine collect PK baseline , cycle 1 day 1 2 , cycle 2 day 1 . Please note : As Febuary 2017 , long evaluate free base form Z-endoxifen expansion cohort due drug supply issue .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients follow type histologically document solid tumor : ER +/PR+ , ER+/PR , ER/PR+ breast cancer Gynecologic tumor ( endometrial , ovarian , uterine , fallopian tube , peritoneal , etc . ) Desmoid tumor Tumors ER+ PR+ immunohistochemistry ( include lowlevel expression ) nonsmall cell lung , colorectal , prostate Patients breast cancer must least one prior chemotherapy regimen metastatic disease . Additionally , patient breast cancer must receive prior tamoxifen and/or aromatase inhibitor therapy ( postmenopausal ) least one hormonal regimen metastatic setting . Patients HER2+ breast cancer must progress least one prior HER2directed regimen ( trastuzumab , lapatinib ) metastatic disease . All patient must disease progressed follow least one line standard therapy . Prior therapy tamoxifen allow . Patients enrol base tumor ER/PR status must ER/PR status confirm Laboratory Pathology , NIH . ER/PR status determine metastatic site , possible ; otherwise , original site available tissue acceptable . Patients must recover least eligibility level follow display adverse event and/or toxicity due prior chemotherapy biologic therapy . They must hormonal therapy , chemotherapy biologic therapy within 4 week prior enter study ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C , UCN01 ) . Patients must great equal 2 week since prior administration study drug Phase 0 study ( also refer `` early Phase I study '' `` prePhase I study '' subtherapeutic dose drug administer ) PI 's discretion . Patients must great equal 4 week since prior radiation major surgery . However , patient receive bisphosphonates therapeutic anticoagulation eligible trial . Age great equal 18 year The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 Life expectancy &gt; 3 month Patients must normal adequate organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/microL Platelets great equal 100,000/micorL Total bilirubin within less equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal Creatinine &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal OR Creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 ( 2 ) patient creatinine level great equal 1.5 time upper limit normal . The effect Zendoxifen develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate nonhormonal contraception ( barrier method birth control abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 2 month discontinuation study . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test order eligible . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother Zendoxifen , breastfeed discontinue mother treated Zendoxifen . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial , exception patient whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable great equal 3 month treatment brain metastasis , without steroid antiseizure medication . These patient may enrol discretion principal investigator . Patients clinically significant illness could compromise participation study , include , limited , uncontrolled infection , uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled hypertension , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within past 6 month , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , stroke/cerebrovascular accident within past 6 month , psychiatric illness/social situation investigator opinion would make undesirable patient participate trial , would jeopardize compliance protocol . Patients untreated spinal cord metastases metastasis close vital organ ( determine principal investigator ) exclude risk hormonal flare . Patients history deep vein thrombosis must anticoagulation therapy prior enrollment . Patients require prophylactic anticoagulation eligible .</criteria>
