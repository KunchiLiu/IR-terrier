	<brief_title>Risk Factors Concurrent Endometrial Carcinoma Patients With Curettage Diagnosis Endometrial Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We retrospectively review case seventy-seven patient hysterectomy endometrial hyperplasia January 1996 September 2006 Department Obstetrics Gynecology , National Taiwan University Hospital . A preoperative pathologic diagnosis endometrial hyperplasia obtain D &amp; C ( dilation curettage ) patient . Twenty diagnose endometrial carcinoma hysterectomy specimen . All specimen review gynecologic pathologist . Depending final pathologic report hysterectomy , divide seventy-seven patient two group - non-endometrial carcinoma group endometrial carcinoma group . Fifty-seven study patient non-endometrial carcinoma group twenty endometrial carcinoma group . As already mention , investigated clinical parameter include age , menopausal status , obstetrical history , medical history diabetes hypertension , BMI ( body mass index ) preoperative pathology D &amp; C . The clinical pathologic characteristic twenty patient diagnose endometrial carcinoma postoperatively also review . Initial manifestation , histological grading carcinoma , depth myometrial invasion , without adjuvant radiotherapy recurrence include . The histological grading endometrial carcinoma base FIGO ( International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics ) definition . The BMIs patient endometrial carcinoma also analyze receiver operate characteristic curve . The Research Ethics Committee National Taiwan University Hospital approve study . Statistical analysis perform Independent-Samples T test Mann-Whitney test . Subsequently , multivariate analysis risk factor also employ Binary logistic regression model obtain adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) selective variable . P &lt; 0.05 defined significant .</detailed_description>
