	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Uterine Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess activity pazopanib patient persistent recurrent carcinosarcoma uterus measure proportion patient survive progression-free least 6 month proportion patient objective tumor response ( complete partial ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine frequency severity adverse event assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4.0 ( CTCAE v4.0 ) . II . To determine duration progression-free survival overall survival . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
