	<brief_summary>The standard treatment localize breast cancer base conservative surgery ( possible ) follow radiation therapy ( RT ) deliver whole breast . The recommended total RT dose 45 50 Gy deliver 4.5 5 week follow 10 16 Gy boost tumor bed 1 1.5 week . The rationale development APBI base difficulty many patient reach RT center receive standard whole breast irradiation ( WBI ) conservative surgery . APBI offer decrease overall treatment time several theoretical advantage WBI , include decrease dose deliver uninvolved portion breast adjacent organ . If equivalence two treatment show , APBI consider historic evolution breast cancer management . In phase III trial , design postmenopausal woman &gt; 50 year age , objective compare effectiveness safety APBI compare whole breast irradiation . This study also design ensure high quality criterion surgery , pathology RT techniques 3 arm allow provide data economics cost .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Following breast conservative surgery , patient stratify accord follow prognostic factor use minimisation technique : age ( &lt; 70 v ≥70 ) , HER2 status ( HER2+ vs HER2- ) , hormonal receptor status ( RH+ vs RH- ) lymph node invasion ( pN0 v pN0i+ ) . Patients allocate receive either standard treatment , hypofractionated treatment APBI . Radiation therapy start 4 12 week last surgery . Patients treated standard whole breast irradiation receive total dose 50 Gy 25 fraction , 2 Gy per day , 5 day week . The boost 16 Gy deliver 8 fraction patient completion 50 Gy , without interruption . All patient receive one fraction per day , 5 fraction week . Patients treat hypofractionated irradiation receive total dose either 40 Gy ( 15 fraction , 2.66 Gy per day ) 42.5 Gy ( 16 fraction , 2.65 Gy per day ) 5 day week . Patients treat APBI receive total dose 40 Gy 10 fraction , deliver twice day time period 5-7 day . Each daily dose must separate 6 hour . Patients follow 3 6 month last dose irradiation , 12 month date last surgery yearly basis 10 year .</detailed_description>
