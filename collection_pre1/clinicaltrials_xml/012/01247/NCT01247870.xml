	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect tablet medication , call metformin , flare-ups ( exacerbation ) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . The investigator believe metformin may effectively control blood sugar level COPD exacerbation . This important evidence high blood sugar level exacerbation may link bad prognosis . The investigator also think metformin may potentially useful effect inflammation , antioxidant level , effectiveness steroid treatment , recovery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Does metformin low blood sugar level patient suffer exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) ? COPD fourth lead cause death worldwide , major cause ill health . In UK , affect 3.7 million people cause 30,000 death per year . It usually , always , cause smoking . Most people affect 65-years-old . Sufferers experience progressively worsening cough , sputum production , breathlessness exercise limitation . This punctuate 'flare-ups ' ( exacerbation ) , symptoms worsen substantially . Approximately 25 % patient hospitalised exacerbation die within year , 50 % within 5 year . There press need new improve treatment COPD exacerbation . This study assess effect metformin , tablet medication , COPD exacerbation . Metformin common use 50 year patient diabetes , low blood sugar level . In COPD exacerbation , blood sugar level often high , high , likely patient poor outcome . This lead u speculate lower sugar level metformin may improve outcome COPD exacerbation . However , COPD diabetes quite different disease , investigator know whether metformin work sugar-lowering medicine COPD exacerbation . The investigator need confirm investigator perform large study assess effect outcome readmission mortality rate . The investigator test medicine 1-month trial patient hospitalise COPD exacerbation . The target sample size 69 patient , minimum 48 patient require primary endpoint analysis . Two-thirds patient take metformin , one-third dummy ( placebo ) tablet . Neither patient researcher know take . The investigator measure sugar level regular finger-prick test , compare average reading two group . The investigator also assess medicine 's effect marker blood sugar level , carry additional exploratory investigation effect medicine clinical outcome , marker inflammation , marker oxidative/carbonyl stress steroid responsiveness .</detailed_description>
