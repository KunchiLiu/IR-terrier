	<brief_summary>Recently , interest increase sublingual immunotherapy ( SLIT ) treat allergic rhinitis . It often suggest polysensitized patient might benefit specific immunotherapy much monosensitized patient , although research subject need . This study compare efficacy SLIT standardize house dust mite extract mono- polysensitized allergic rhinitis patient . Patients sensitized house dust mite treat SLIT house dust mites least 1 year November 2007 March 2010 include . The mono-allergen sensitized group ( Mgr ) define patient sensitized Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus ( Dp ) D. farinae ( Df ; n = 70 ) . The poly-allergen sensitized group ( Pgr ) define patient simultaneously sensitize house dust mite allergen ( n = 64 ) . A standardized extract house dust mite use immunotherapy . Anti-allergic medication total nasal symptom score ( TNSS ) , include rhinorrhea , sneeze , nasal obstruction , itchy nose , evaluate 1 year SLIT . This study enrol 134 patient . The TNSS improve significantly SLIT group , change TNSS differ significantly group . The anti-allergic medication score also decrease significantly group , significant difference group . In polysensitized allergic rhinitis patient , SLIT Dp/Df give comparable improvement nasal symptom rescue medication score monosensitized patient , regardless positive allergen . SLIT Dp/Df might consider polysensitized allergic rhinitis patient .</brief_summary>
