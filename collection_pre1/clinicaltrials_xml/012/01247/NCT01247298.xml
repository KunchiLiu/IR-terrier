	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Trans Arterial Chemoembolization ( TACE ) , Followed Stereotactic Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective research 1 . Evaluate safety combination TACE high dose SBRT 2 . Measure time progression ( TTP ) local recurrence rate HCC treat combination TACE &amp; SBRT . Secondary objective research 1 . Assess failure pattern survival patient treat TACE &amp; SBRT . 2 . Analyze dose volume characteristic influence Radiation Induced Liver Disease ( RILD ) among patient treat combination TACE SBRT .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis Patients meeting follow criterion consider enrollment : Pathologically confirm HCC OR HCC great 2 cm classic radiographic finding 2 separate test modality , HCC great 2 cm serum alpha fetoprotein great 200 . Lesions : Single liver lesion : measuring 3 cm ≤ 8 cm* . Multiple liver lesion : ≤ 3 liver lesion , none measure 5 cm , provide lesion consider TACE . Lesions &lt; 3 cm unfavorable location ablation† *The size criterion hepatic lesion also subject dose volume constraint radiotherapy , describe . Patient Patient deem liver transplant candidate time study entry ( refuse transplant ) . Patient deem candidate surgical resection time study entry ( refuse surgical resection ) . Patient deem candidate ablation ( refuse ablation therapy ) . Patient must candidate receive TACE . ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) Zubrod Performance Scale = 01 . Age &gt; 19 Patient pregnant . Women childbearing potential male participant must practice adequate contraception . Adequate organ function evidence : Hematology Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1,200 cells/mm3 &lt; 2 week prior entry Platelets &gt; 40,000 cells/mm3 &lt; 2 week prior entry study Hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dl &lt; 2 week prior entry study Liver Functions Bilirubin &lt; 2 time normal limit , INR &lt; 2 , liver enzymes less 3 time normal limit draw within 2 week prior study entry . Patients develop tumor recurrence follow liver transplant , liver resection liver ablation eligible study . Patients Child Pugh Class A &amp; B disease eligible study ; Class C patient ineligible . Patients normal liver function compensate cirrhosis eligible study . However , patient poorly control ascites ineligible study ( see ) . Patients clinically significant liver failure ineligible . Underlying liver cirrhosis contraindication entry , record analysis relationship toxicity development . Signed informed consent document Male female patient ethnic group . Female patient must surgically sterile , postmenopausal ( menses least one year ) , use medically approve method contraception . Men must agree use medically approve method contraception . Age &gt; 19 year . Imaging must complete within 60 day prior study entry . CT Simulation image may use Liver Chest image give image include chest Radiation Oncologists review comment chest image . Patient must evaluate radiation oncologist within 2 week prior study entry . Patients present follow include study : 1 . Prior invasive malignancy ineligible , unless patient free disease 5 year . For example patient register study treatment HCC , history prior colorectal cancer . ( Patients nonmelanoma skin cancer situ cancer breast , oral cavity , cervix eligible ) . 2 . Prior radiotherapy liver surround area would result overlap radiation therapy field ineligibility criterion . Patients know contraindication radiation include systemic sclerosis , ulcerative colitis etc . also ineligible . 3 . Systemic therapy use chemotherapy and/or target agent give within 2 week prior TACE , RT , / within 3 week follow RT completion ground exclusion . Patients receive Bevacizumab vascular endothelial growth factor antagonists 2 month prior follow TACE/ RT ineligible . Administration Anthracyclines chemotherapy agent dominant hepatotoxicity within 8 week completion RT also exclusion criterion . 4 . Severe comorbidity include ( restrict ) unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization within last 6 month , transmural myocardial infarction within last 6 month , uncontrolled arterial hypertension , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , dementia , acute infection ( bacterial , fungal HIV infection require oral intravenous antibiotic time registration , severe chronic airway disease ( COPD ) serious illness require hospitalization preclude study therapy time registration contraindication . 5 . Patients receive anticoagulation treatment Coumadin IV heparin ( include anticoagulation maintain central line ) result INR ( international normalize ratio ) &gt; 2 time upper level normal ineligible . 6 . Uncontrolled symptomatic clinical ascites make patient ineligible study . 7 . Major surgical procedure within 3 week prior study entry . 8 . History hypersensitivity chemotherapy agent , contrast material . 9 . Pregnancy , breastfeed plan become pregnant . 10 . Treatment investigational product last 4 week study entry . 11 . Mental condition render subject unable understand nature , scope , possible consequence study . Patients Reproductive Potential The patient must pregnant breastfeed enrollment study . Absence pregnancy must demonstrate serum urine test prior enrollment study . Female patient child bear potential ( i.e. , ovulate , premenopausal , surgical sterile ) must use medically accepted contraceptive regimen . Male patient must agree use medically approve method contraception .</criteria>
