	<brief_summary>Background : - Pleuropulmonary blastoma ( PPB ) rare fast-growing lung tumor associate , rare tumor type . Most case PPB appear child young 6 year age . Recently , show condition inherit ( e.g. , mutation DICER1 gene ) . Researchers study clinical genetic aspect newly describe condition . They interest collect medical history genetic information individual close relative individual PPB rare associate tumor . Objectives : - To study individual personal family history pleuropulmonary blastoma ( PPB ) rare tumor associate PPB ( e.g. , cystic nephroma , nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma , ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor , ocular medulloepithelioma ) . Eligibility : - Individuals diagnose PPB and/or PPB-related tumor . - Close blood relative ( e.g. , parent , sibling , grandparent ) individual diagnose PPB and/or PPB-related tumor . Design : - Interested participant enroll inquire study call 1-800-518-8474 . - Participants ask complete family history medical history questionnaire . They complete questionnaire least 18 year age , another person complete questionnaire key family member young . - Participants ask sign medical record release form allow researcher examine detailed medical history information . - Participants may ask physical examination image study , provide blood saliva sample , provide tumor tissue prior biopsy cancer surgery . - Annually , participant update family history individual information questionnaire document important change medical history , also update medical record release form . Participants may ask provide additional cheek lining cell and/or blood sample , well tumor tissue new plan biopsy tumor surgery . - Treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DICER1-related Pleuropulmonary Blastoma Cancer Predisposition Syndrome : A Natural History Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : In 2009 , Hill colleague identify heterozygous germline mutation DICER1 , gene encodes crucial component microRNA processing machinery , patient familial pleuropulmonary blastoma ( PPB ) . This disorder represent first report cancer predisposition syndrome due alter microRNA biogenesis , discovery present unique extraordinary opportunity CGB DCEG play substantial role development new area , one virtually certain etiologic ramification far beyond related PPB . PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : 1 . To establish cohort patient PPB and/or specific neoplasm PPB spectrum ( cystic nephroma , nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma , ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell sex cord-stromal tumor , ocular medulloepithelioma , Wilms tumor , embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma , pineoblastoma , others define ) , order determine frequency DICER1 germline mutation patient family member . This also allow u identify DICER1 mutation-negative patient crucial future gene discovery effort . 2 . To characterize clinical phenotype , study incident prevalent cancer rate , patient family member , cancer combine , type cancer , identify confirm specific type cancer benign neoplasms associate disorder . 3 . To identify difference patient germline mutation DICER1 ( another gene ( ) pathway ) develop cancer develop cancer . These difference may include genotype/phenotype/cancer susceptibility difference , modifier gene ( gene-gene interaction ) environmental risk factor ( gene-environment interaction ) . The latter two may informative modification cancer risk general population . 4 . To develop evidence-based management guideline cancer prevention risk-reduction strategy PPB patient family member prior obtain answer questions/objectives . 5 . To evaluate various parameter relate psychosocial behavioral issue result member family increase risk PPB . 6 . To create biospecimen repository carefully-annotated tissue sample use subsequent etiologically-oriented translational research project . These sample comprise invaluable resource current future study relate etiology , outcomes follow , various neoplasm know , later find , part PPB syndrome . ELIGIBILITY : - Individuals PPB relatives interest ( parent , sibling , grandparent , affecteds ) . - Individuals general population one unique tumor report patient family PPB : cystic nephroma , ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor , ocular medulloepithelioma , nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma , associate condition identify objective 2 . Relatives patient eligible study enrollment well ( parent , sibling , mutation carrier , affecteds ) . DESIGN : - Multidisciplinary natural history study self-administered questionnaire , clinical/epidemiologic/genetic evaluation , clinical research laboratory test , review medical record , cancer surveillance , biospecimen acquisition : - Field Cohort : consented subject provide questionnaire data , biological sample , medical record , image result , etc. , home community . - NIH Cohort : consented subject , also travel NIH Clinical Center detail in-person assessment data collection . - Primary endpoint include cancer , specific attention currently think part PPB syndrome spectrum . - Secondary endpoint include non-malignant health issue . - Systematic analysis entire data set occur yearly basis . - Ancillary study perform use data biospecimens collect study participant , new collaborative opportunity research hypotheses become available . We best articulate specific use make information material collect part project . We also recognize knowledge technology progress rapid rate impossible predict way material use future . The Consent Form provide outline kind research anticipate , seek subject approval latitude samples/data use ( opportunity opt us ) , order minimize likelihood additional consent would need sought future , ensure position , public steward incredibly valuable resource , take maximum advantage utility advance scientific clinical knowledge .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients histologicallyconfirmed PPB relatives interest [ parent , sibling , mutation carrier ( e.g. , grandparent ) , affect ] . Given rarity disorder , open patient world , discretion PI ( e.g . availability medical record English , ability patient/family communicate English ) follow NIH travel regulation . Patients general population one unique tumor type see patients/families PPB cystic nephroma , ovarian SertoliLeydig cell sex cordstromal tumor , ocular medulloepithelioma , nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma , Wilms tumor , embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma , pineoblastoma regardless family history . Relatives patient eligible study well ( parent , sibling , mutation carrier , affecteds ) . Additional syndromeassociated neoplasm may identify future , add protocol need . All type amount prior therapy allow . There age restriction . There restriction relate organ marrow function . Ability proband guardian understand , willingness sign , write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals family refer evaluation report diagnosis verifiable . Inability provide inform consent .</criteria>
