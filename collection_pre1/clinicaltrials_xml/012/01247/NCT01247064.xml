	<detailed_description>Acute bronchiolitis frequent cause infant hospitalization United States . Bronchiolitis typically refer viral low respiratory tract infection first two year life manifest constellation clinical symptom include wheezing , cough respiratory distress . In addition tremendous disease burden , bronchiolitis admission United States cost $ 500 million year . The primary pathophysiologic process bronchiolitis include airway wall peribronchial inflammation , increase mucous production , slough necrotic epithelial cell , impair airway clearance . These process result airway obstruction , gas trapping , atelectasis impair gas exchange . Standard therapies bronchiolitis remain supportive , include maintain hydration nutrition , ensure adequate oxygenation , physical suctioning nasal airways clear secretion . Therapies bronchodilator albuterol , although commonly use standard practice , proven impact progression disease improve long-term outcome bronchiolitis . Nebulized hypertonic saline ( HS ) show increase mucociliary clearance airway individual healthy lung . In addition nebulized HS increase airway clearance disease process include asthma , cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis . A recent Cochrane review examine 4 small study suggest nebulized 3 % HS may reduce length hospital stay improve clinical severity score infant acute viral bronchiolitis . None study explore use nebulized HS emergency department ( ED ) . A recent study examine use single nebulized treatment epinephrine mixed 3 % HS 46 infant less 12 month present ED bronchiolitis . This study find difference epinephrine dilute normal saline compare epinephrine dilute 3 % HS . Despite effect clinical score , investigator note trend toward decrease rate hospitalization . Furthermore , since first ED study first negative study , author conclude investigation necessary determine HS role management acute bronchiolitis . The purpose current study determine whether nebulized 3 % HS improve respiratory distress child 2-23 month present ED acute bronchiolitis persistent respiratory distress initial therapy trial nebulized albuterol . Given tremendous clinical financial burden bronchiolitis , effective therapy , particularly one inexpensive , potential result significant health care saving . If nebulized 3 % HS improve clinical score ED , may provide inexpensive , safe effective therapy child bronchiolitis acute care set .</detailed_description>
