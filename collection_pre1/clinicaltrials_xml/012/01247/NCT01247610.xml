	<brief_summary>Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) recognize common ( 5-8 % ) , early-onset , long-term impairing , heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorder high heritability . Due lifelong impairment adulthood , adult ADHD drawn much attention Western study past decade ; however , study Asian country . The ultimate goal longitudinal follow-up study investigate outcome cohort child attention-deficit/hyperactivity ( ADHD ) healthy control young adulthood primary aim ; test whether structural functional brain connectivity endophenotypes ADHD , localize brain area correspond methylphenidate treatment effect , identify genetic variant correspond persistence ADHD , treatment effect methylphenidate , neurocognitive dysfunction , structural functional dysconnectivity brain secondary aim . With accomplishment goal , study provide first-hand data adult ADHD non-western country , one world-class study topic neurocognitive image genomics adult ADHD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary specific aim : To describe manifestation persistence ADHD symptom investigate psychiatric , social , executive functioning outcome young adulthood among child ADHD ; Secondary specific aim 1 . To identify early individual ( clinical , behavioral , executive function neurocognitive variable ) , family , school , environmental factor predict symptom persistence wide-range outcome young adulthood ; 2 . To validate structural functional connectivity frontostriatal circuitry image endophenotypes ADHD demonstrate structural connectivity functional connectivity frontostriatal circuitry alter patient ADHD unaffected sibling , associate ADHD symptom , associate gene relate dopamine neurotransmitter system ; 3 . To identify brain area correspond effect methylphenidate ; 4 . To confirm reported candidate gene relate dopamine noradrenergic neurotransmitter system association ADHD severity subtypes ( persistence , comorbidity , functional impairment , treatment effect ) endophenotypes ( executive function structural functional brain connectivity ) DAT1 , DRD4 , MAO-A , ADRA2A , ADRA2C , NET , COMT . The sample consist cohort 217 young adult ( 180 male , 83 % ) diagnose ADHD childhood 173 healthy control ( 123 male , 71 % ) . At age 17-24 ( around 6 year assessment adolescence ) , receive psychiatric interview ( ADHD+SADS , CAADID ) make diagnosis ADHD psychiatric disorder blood sample collection . They complete follow questionnaire : ASRS CAARS-S : S adult ADHD symptom , TPQ personality characteristic , ASRI-4 DSM-IV psychopathology , AAQoL WFIRS social function , PBI parenting style ; perform WAIS-III current IQ Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Batteries attention control executive functioning . Among cohort subject , 30 subject persistent ADHD same-sex -handedness unaffected sibling ( n = 30 ) , 30 ADHD subject DAT1 and/or good response methylphenidate ( repeat MRI assessment one week later ) base clinical assessment , 30 subject without lifetime ADHD psychiatric disorder receive diffusion spectrum imaging ( DSI ) rest state functional MRI assessment ( total number MRI assessment , 150 ) . We genotype 3'VNTR DAT1 gene candidate gene involve dopaminergic adrenergic system ( DRD4 , MAO-A , ADRA2A , ADRA2C , NET , COMT ) case-control association study use SNP haplotype analysis . We anticipate study ( 1 ) provide first prospective , longitudinal data child ADHD late adolescence young adulthood Asian population ; ( 2 ) one first establish comprehensive , multi-dimensional dataset combine clinical , family , psychosocial , academic/vocational , neuropsychological , neuroimaging , genetic data young adult ADHD . With inclusion image genetics data , behavioral neurocognitive phenotype ADHD validate , image endophenotype test , image genetics approach may help identify genetic variant ADHD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Persistent ADHD combine type ( Group 1 , n=30 ) : Subjects persistent diagnosis ADHD , combine type , adulthood accord DSMIV diagnostic criterion samesex unaffected sibling include . If 30 subject meet inclusion criterion , subject severe ADHD symptom base ASRS KSADS rating include . 2 . Unaffected sibling ( Group 2 , n=30 ) : The sex handedness unaffected sibling Group 1 recruit . They need reassess psychiatric interview confirm lifetime diagnosis ADHD . 3 . Good response MPH ( Group 3 , n=30 ) : Subjects whose ADHD symptoms meet DSMIV symptom criterion adulthood either DAT1 gene ( around 10 % Taiwanese child ADHD15 ) demonstrate good response MPH base clinical interview recruit offand onstimulant DSI rest state fMRI assessment . 4 . NonADHD ( Group 4 , n=30 ) : Among healthy control without lifetime ADHD , control lifetime psychiatric disorder impair neuropsychological function include . The control subject match age , gender , handedness Group 1 . These subject exclude study follow criterion : ( 1 ) Comorbidity DSMIVTR diagnosis pervasive developmental disorder , schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , delusional disorder , psychotic disorder , organic psychosis , schizotypal personality disorder , bipolar disorder , depression , severe anxiety disorder substance use ; ( 2 ) With neurodegenerative disorder , epilepsy , involuntary movement disorder , congenital metabolic disorder , brain tumor , history severe head trauma , history craniotomy ; ( 3 ) With visual hearing impairment , motor disability may influence process MRI assessment . In addition , control subject ODD CD , exclude .</criteria>
