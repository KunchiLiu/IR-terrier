	<brief_summary>The purpose propose study ( 1 ) collect data feasibility offer Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) intervention reduce fatigue psychological distress cancer patient active treatment cancer ( 2 ) estimate effect size intervention fatigue , depression , anxiety , sleep disturbance . The investigator also obtain preliminary effect size degree intervention increase mindfulness , investigator evaluate dosage effect . Findings suggest whether future randomize controlled trial cancer-related fatigue ( CRF ) primary outcome feasible warrant . Participants randomly assign either MBSR intervention arm wait-list control arm . The MBSR intervention consist weekly 2-hour class hold seven consecutive week Indiana University Simon Cancer Center Pavilion ; class week six extend 3-hour `` retreat . '' Participants invited engage daily home practice meditation mindfulness exercise . All participant complete series self-report questionnaire prior start class , immediately follow end class , 1 month class end . Those intervention arm begin MBSR class week enrollment ; control group offer 7-week program 1-month post-intervention follow-up assessment completed—approximately 13 week enrollment . Primary Aim 1 : Obtain preliminary RCT effect size change fatigue MBSR treatment group compare wait-list control group . Hypothesis 1 : Immediately post-intervention ( T2 ) , improvement fatigue compare pre-intervention ( T1 ) great treatment group control group . Hypothesis 2 : At 1 month post intervention ( T3 ) , improvement fatigue compare pre-intervention ( T1 ) great treatment group improvement control group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary Aim 1 : Obtain preliminary randomize control trial ( RCT ) effect size change depression , anxiety , sleep disturbance MBSR treatment group compare wait-list control group . Hypothesis 1 : Immediately post-intervention ( T2 ) , improvement depression , anxiety , sleep compare pre-intervention ( T1 ) great treatment group control group . Secondary Aim 2 : Obtain preliminary effect size degree intervention increase mindfulness relationship mindfulness fatigue , depression , anxiety , sleep disturbance . Hypothesis 1 : At T2 30-days post-intervention ( T3 ) , improvement mindfulness compare pre-intervention ( T1 ) great treatment group control group . Hypothesis 2 : Degree mindfulness negatively correlate fatigue , depression , anxiety , sleep disturbance time-points . Secondary Aim 3 : Evaluate feasibility recruit fatigued cancer patient participate MBSR-CRF , well acceptability dosage effect MBSR-CRF . Hypothesis 1 : At least 30 % patient meet study criterion choose enroll propose study . Hypothesis 2 : The MBSR intervention protocol demonstrate feasibility ( 1 ) least 70 % participant attend least 4 7 schedule class , ( 2 ) least 70 % participant practice mindfulness least 60 minute per week . Hypothesis 3 : Class attendance hour mindfulness practice per week positively associate indicated correlation effect size improvement process variable ( degree mindfulness ) well primary outcome variable ( i.e. , fatigue ) secondary outcome variable ( i.e. , depression , anxiety , sleep disturbance ) .</detailed_description>
