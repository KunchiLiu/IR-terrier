	<brief_summary>Branch retinal vein occlusion lead cause vision loss . Treatment ranibizumab ( vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) inhibitor ) monthly basis associate improved vision result . There subgroup patient peripheral nonperfusion ultrawidefield angiography appear dependent anti-VEGF treatment . In trial investigator compare gold standard monthly ranibizumab injection ranibizumab + peripheral scatter laser area nonperfusion angiography . Each group monthly injection first six month , need either visual acuity decrease increase retinal thickness subsequent six month . The primary outcome visual acuity .
