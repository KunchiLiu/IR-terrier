	<detailed_description>The objective prospective clinical trial demonstrate safety efficacy CorMatrix ECM Pericardial Closure reduce incidence new onset postoperative atrial fibrillation circumferentially reconstruct normal pericardial anatomy follow isolated , first-time , coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) procedure compare subject undergo pericardial closure . Safety establish demonstrate composite clinical event rate ECM treatment group bad control group undergo pericardial closure . The efficacy establish demonstrate reduce incidence new onset postoperative atrial fibrillation ECM treatment group compare control group .</detailed_description>
