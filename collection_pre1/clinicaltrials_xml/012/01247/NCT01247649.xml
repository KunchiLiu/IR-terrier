	<brief_title>Assessing Continuous Non- Invasive Blood Glucose Sensor- Physical Logic AG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The non invasive continuous glucose sense system Physical Logic base vector network analyzer ( VNA ) , monitor blood glucose propriety sensors.Dielectric spectroscopy analytical technique whereby electromagnetic radiation affect electric dipole moment sample interacts . This method utilize change impedance antenna measure change relaxation process interrogated medium . The VNA ( vector network analyzer ) , emit non irradiate electromagnetic wave low power emission , connect via standard coaxial cable propriety sensor attach patient skin without direct contact . Study objective : To evaluate feasibility new noninvasive method measure continuous glucose value use electromagnetic radiation.The glucose value generate investigational non invasive devise compare glucose read reference devise , measure blood glucose level subcutaneous tissue . During study evaluate reliability study device condition alter blood glucose value range 50-400 mg/dl :</detailed_description>
