This study compare three group patient : allergic-like reaction , ORS vaccinate individual adverse event . Pregnant woman participate study . The study three goal . First , investigator want determine , among allergic-like reaction influenza vaccination , proportion ( percentage ) people actually allergic vaccine component .
