	<brief_title>Different Genetic Features Associated With Hepatic Carcinogenesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) lead cause cancer death Taiwan . HCC normally develop consequence underlie liver disease often associate cirrhosis . Surgical resection liver transplantation current best curative option treat HCC . However , recurrence metastasis quite common patient resection survival rate 30 % 40 % 5 year postoperatively . MicroRNAs , small non-coding RNA , act endogenous RNA interference post-transcription regulation . Recent study suggest microRNAs may act tumor suppressor oncogene alter microRNA expression level may play important role cancer initiation progression . Several study , include , show specific microRNAs aberrantly express malignant HCC tissue compare normal counterpart . Although many microRNA profile study do diagnose hepatocarcinogenesis , data prognostic significance postsurgical survival limit . The main point study develop predictive signature postsurgical survival HCC patient .</detailed_description>
