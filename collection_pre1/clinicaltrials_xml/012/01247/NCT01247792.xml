	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND About half patient sepsis relate organ failure die ICU , frequently end-of-life decision ( EOL-D ) , i.e . decision withdraw withhold life-supporting therapy forgo cardiopulmonary resuscitation . Lack SOPs communicate share EOL-decisionmaking among staff communicate EOL-D relative may increase burnout anxiety staff well relatives . Also , uncertainty role patient ' advance directive EOL-Decision-making . HYPOTHESES 1 . SOPs interdisciplinary EOL-decisions alleviate staff burnout ; 2 . A structured strategy communicate EOL-decisions relative lead reduce anxiety depression relatives 3 month event . AIMS 1. develop SOPs EOL-decision-making improve timeliness EOL-D involvement interdisciplinary care-givers . 2. develop strategy communicate EOL-D relative include structured procedure participant , set-up , time content . These aim may adapt accord finding observation period . CONDUCT The study design interrupted time series analysis ( `` before/after study '' ) locate mixed , neurological medical ICUs Jena University Hospital . It compose 3 observation period separate phase data analysis implementation change behavioral practice . After first phase observation data analysis , SOPs include improved communication strategy relatives develop basis collect data . SOPs develop implement participate ICUs . In follow second observation period data collect assess change procedure primary endpoint . A third round data analysis , interpretation observation enable adapt SOPs achieve sustainability ( `` post-implementation phase '' ) .
