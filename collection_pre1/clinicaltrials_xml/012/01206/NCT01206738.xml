	<brief_summary>1 . Do paper-based web-based intervention model experiment ( methodology develop ) identify predictor GP behaviour regard prescribe antibiotic upper respiratory tract infection ? 2 . Can web-based IME system provide trialists richer predictive information upon base development behavioural change intervention paper-based IME system ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Developing Evaluating Interventions Reduce Inappropriate Prescribing Antibiotics Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The NHS need effective quality improvement intervention put clinical practice , require effective behaviour change intervention . Intervention model experiment ( IMEs ) way explore refine intervention move full-scale trial . They deliver key element intervention simulation approximate clinical practice , example , present GPs clinical scenario make treatment decision . Earlier IMEs paper-based , limit do simulation . Web-based IMEs provide potential good clinical simulation , potential lead well intervention . The current proposal run full , web-based IME involve 250 GPs advance methodology IMEs directly compare result earlier paper-based IME . Moreover , web-based IME evaluate intervention put full-scale trial aim reduce antibiotic prescribing primary care . Reducing inappropriate prescribing antibiotic general practice national priority ; indeed , antibiotic use increase UK Scotland 's prescribe second high amongst UK administration . More effective behaviour change intervention need proposal develop one intervention system model test future intervention . This system applicable situation NHS behaviour need modify , include intervention aim directly public .</detailed_description>
