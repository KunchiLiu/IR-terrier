	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give selumetinib together without temsirolimus work treat patient metastatic , recurrent , locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma remove surgery . Selumetinib temsirolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether give selumetinib together temsirolimus effective give selumetinib alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selumetinib With Without Temsirolimus Treating Patients With Metastatic , Recurrent , Locally Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare progression-free survival MEK inhibitor , AZD6244 ( selumetinib ) alone , combination AZD6244 mammalian target rapamycin inhibitor ( mTORi ) , temsirolimus ( CCI-779 ) patient recurrent metastatic recurrent locally unresectable soft-tissue sarcoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine rate apoptosis , autophagy , proliferation AZD6244 alone , combination temsirolimus immunohistochemistry tumor surrogate skin tissue biopsy . ( exploratory ) II . Assess activation status protein kinase B ( Akt ) , 5E-BP1 , eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma , 1 ( eIF-4G ) , ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( S6K ) tumor biopsy sample surrogate skin tissue biopsy sample . ( exploratory ) III . Assess inhibition activate mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 ( ERK1/2 ) stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cell . ( exploratory ) IV . Assess response Choi criterion . V. Compare response rate 4-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate patient treat regimen . VI . Compare response rate , 4-month PFS rate toxicity AZD6244 alone combination temsirolimus . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive selumetinib orally ( PO ) twice daily day 1-28 temsirolimus intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . ARM II : Patients receive selumetinib arm I . Patients experience disease progression may cross arm I . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
