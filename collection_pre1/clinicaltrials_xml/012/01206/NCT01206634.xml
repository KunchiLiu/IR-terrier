Intervention group B include supervised exercise program 32 week combination RIT week 20 , 24 , 28 32 follow-up . For study participant , exercise program consist 4 strengthening exercise participant ask perform 3 set 10 repetition daily . RIT injection : The osteo-tendinous junction insertion sit collateral ligament identify . Patients receive injection 1cc 15 % dextrose 0.6 % lidocaine solution free adrenaline eight administration sit collateral ligament . A 5 cc injection 20 % dextrose 0.5 % lidocaine without adrenaline solution also administer inside knee joint . The intra-articular injection perform use anterior approach . Solutions prepare hospital pharmacist morning injection . Each infiltration precede local sterilization consist three disinfection 2 % chlorexidine 4 % idopropyl alcohol solution . Study variables Several measure functional capacity pain use . The primary outcome Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index severity osteoarthrosis symptom ( WOMAC version 3.1 ) . This self-administered questionnaire ass pain , disability joint stiffness use 24 item 5-point Likert scale . Other outcome include Brief Pain Inventory ( short form ) , administer ass pain intensity pain-related functional impairment ( physical emotional ) . More specifically , four item assess intensity current pain pain least , bad , average past day scale 0 ( `` pain '' ) 10 ( `` pain bad imagine '' ) . Seven item measure pain-related functional interference different domain ( general activity , mood , walk ability , normal work , relation people , sleep , enjoyment life ) rat 0 ( `` interfere '' ) 10 ( `` interfere completely '' ) .

The Timed Up-and-Go Test use evaluate functional capacity . Participants start sit position ( hands resting arm armchair standard height ) , stand , walke 3 meter , turn around , walk back sit chair . The timing start participant 's back come chair , stop buttock touch seat chair . Patients ' severity knee osteoarthritis assess radiologist use Kellgren-Lawrence grade scale . Anteroposterior radiograph knee take prior enrollment study . Follow Participants meet research assistant ( research nurse family medicine resident ) onset study , every four week subsequent 32 week intervention , four week intervention . At visit , participant ask fill measurement questionnaire . Research assistant also investigate presence side effect complication remind participant research protocol restrict take anti-inflammatory medication throughout 32 week intervention . Participants also meet physiotherapist every four week review exercise . At onset study , participant receive study calendar detail appointment . In addition , patient receive appointment card end visit . This card provide time next visit , contact information , well list condition participant contact study center . If participant present sustain deterioration symptom function , experience undesirable side effect , presume contribute part treatment discontinue .</detailed_description>
