	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) complex multi-factorial disease , underlie genetic environmental factor . Different population different susceptibility . The disease characterize 2 main phenotype : relapsing-remitting progressive course . Clinical disability due distraction CNS myelin ( mainly oligodendrocytes ) due 3 process : 1 . Inflammation- immune cell aberrant activity invade brain spinal cord cause distraction CNS myelin . 2 . Primary neurodegeneration - without prominent inflammation 3 . Repair - inflammatory neurodegenerative process follow attempt CNS repair - however , partial incomplete repair often basis residual deficit disability . - The acute MS attack- consider due aberrant acute immune activation inflammatory process CNS - The chronic accumulating disability - consider due Neuro-degenerative process . Repair process mainly note acute attack - recovery function spontaneous . However , severe attack sometimes need add STEROID TREATMENT ( 6 day IV ) acute attack . For long term prophylactic - follow increase understanding disease , last 10-15 year new immunotherapy available ( COPAXON / TEVA ; Interferon -beta ) . However attenuate disease ( reduce number relapse per year ) cure . Also , beneficial ~40 % Relapsing -Remitting patient . Currently biomarkers available MS ( oligoclonal IgG CSF - help confirm diagnosis require invasive procedure correlate disease activity response therapy ) - monitoring MS treatment MRI - expensive . Dr Hossam Haick Technion develop electronic nose base nanomaterials diagnosis disease ( e.g. , cancer , kidney failure , etc . ) via breath sample . Research hypothesis Biomarkers CNS inflammation and/or neurodegeneration and/or CNS repair detect `` electronic nose '' . Aim ( ) Identification biomarkers : 1 . CNS inflammation CNS-autoimmunity 2 . Neurodegeneration 3 . CNS repair may serve marker disease ( v control ) , disease activity ( predict aggressive disease course ( predict Relapse ; predict Malignant v Benign MS ) ; predict response therapy ( Steroid , immunotherapy neuroprotective agent ) . Work plan outline : Evaluate group clinically : - MS patient acute relapse pre - vs- 7 30 day steroids treatment . - Relapsing MS patient vs Progressive MS patient vs Healthy control . - MS patient Good- vs Poor- Responders immunotherapy When available , MRI use surrogate marker , together clinical assessment . Evaluation Electronic Nose Diagnosis MS We apply four-phase approach order achieve objective research . In first phase collect suitable breath sample patient compare patient data age-adjusted healthy control . In second phase analyze collect breath sample electronic nose setup . In third phase carry auxiliary chemical analysis , use gas-chromatography link mass spectrometry ( GC-MS ) , breath sample different aspect . The fourth phase aim improvement electronic nose setup conduct parallel first three phase . We collect breath sample representative group MS patient type age-matched control . Our GC-MS chemical analysis address : ( 1 ) dependence MS breath biomarker level type/stage MS disease ; ( 2 ) effect environmental factor age , diet , lifestyle ( especially smoke drink habit ) chemical composition breath . Based result GC-MS chemical analysis , improve optimize array nanosensors setup achieve : ( 1 ) maximum sensitivity MS biomarkers stage dependent concentration profile ; ( 2 ) minimum sensitivity non-MS related change chemical composition breath , ( 3 ) minimum sensitivity major ingredient breath , water vapor . We attempt define MS sub-categories , support information clinical/imaging report , might relevant clinical management , sophisticated statistical treatment collect data . Towards end proof-of-concept study compare performance electronic nose setup conventional MS diagnostic tool . The comparison do term true positive , true negative , false positive , false negative , sensitivity specificity .</detailed_description>
