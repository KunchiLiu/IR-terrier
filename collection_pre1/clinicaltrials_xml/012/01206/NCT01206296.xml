	<brief_summary>This phase II study evaluate use intraperitoneal gemcitabine give intraoperatively adjuvant therapy patient resectable pancreas cancer . The primary objective study evaluate overall safety intraperitoneal gemcitabine give intraoperatively postoperatively adjuvant treatment resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma . The secondary objective evaluate efficacy treatment regimen reflect overall survival 2-years , study pattern disease recurrence follow treatment , study pharmacology intraperitoneal gemcitabine study change peritoneal cytology pancreatic cancer resection .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma pancreas periampullary cancer ( duodenum , ampulla Vater distal common bile duct ) . Patients without histologically confirm diagnosis prior surgical exploration , intraoperative frozen section confirm diagnosis prior administration intraoperative intraperitoneal gemcitabine . Patients must undergo adequate preoperative imaging evaluation determine resectability include contrast enhance CT scan MRI without endoscopic ultrasound Patients must complete surgical resection grossly negative margin . The margin assess routine fashion : surgeon decide level transection base visual inspection make sure visible/palpable tumor remove negative margin . The specimen assess pancreatic duct bile duct margin intraoperative frozen section attempt make microscopically negative margin case . Patients receive chemotherapy treatment pancreatic cancer prior surgery schedule Washington Hospital Center may include protocol . Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use gemcitabine patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric phase 2 combination trial . Life expectancy great 6 month ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) performance status &lt; 2 Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit compatible preoperative biliary obstruction cause tumor AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal compatible preoperative biliary obstruction cause tumor creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; 45 mL/min The effect gemcitabine develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree avoid pregnancy prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients radiotherapy chemotherapy pancreatic cancer Patients receive investigational agent . Patients metastatic disease liver distant site , intraabdominal lymph node beyond regional drain lymph node malignant ascites History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition gemcitabine . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study gemcitabine antimetabolite ( pyrimidine analog ) potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother gemcitabine , breastfeed discontinue mother treated gemcitabine . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction gemcitabine . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
