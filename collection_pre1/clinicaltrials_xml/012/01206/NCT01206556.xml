	<detailed_description>Genital Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) infection common sexually transmitted infection ( STI ) United States worldwide . Over 50 % sexually active adolescent become infected HPV . HPV infection strongly associate development anogenital dysplasia invasive cancer . Because HPV STI , optimal prevention woman depend prevention partner well . Males remain significant reservoir HPV vaccinate essential rapidly prevent transmission HPV community . P1085 sub study P1047 , investigate safety immunogenicity Quadrivalent HPV ( QHPV ) HIV-infected girl boy , age 7 &lt; 12 year age . This study placebo-controlled trial compare recommend three dose schedule QHPV one study arm ( Arm A ) arm receive placebo ( Arm B ) . P1047 thus far demonstrated QHPV safely administer human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected boys girl stimulate seroconversion 95 % vaccinee . However , antibody level 30-50 % low achieve child without HIV infection . Since level vaccine-induced antibody decline time vaccination , uncertain vaccine-induced immunity life-long . This concern support evidence naturally acquire HPV-specific antibody might decline level permit re-infection . Comparative persistence data HPV-specific antibody available 5-6 year vaccination almost 1000 child without HIV infection ( manufacturer 's data , unpublished ) , information available HIV-infected vaccinee . We seek determine long-term durability kinetics vaccine-induced HPV-type-specific antibody CMI responses HIV-infected child , , immunized P1047 . These subject unique cohort allow u approach specific clinical issue .</detailed_description>
