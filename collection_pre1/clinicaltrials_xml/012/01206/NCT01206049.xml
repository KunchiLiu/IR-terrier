Thrombocytes ≥ 100x10^9/l Biochemistry : Bilirubinemia ≤ 3 x upper normal level . ALAT ≤ 5 x upper normal level . Creatinine ≤ upper normal level . At raise creatinine level measure calculated GFR must least 50 % low normal level Fertile woman must present negative pregnancy test use secure birth control 6 month treatment . Men fertile partner must also take care secure birth control . Written orally inform consent Previous cytostatic treatment inoperable cholangiocarcinoma Adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy , radiation therapy immunotherapy within 4 week prior treatment start Other concomitant experimental treatment Severe medical disease considerable heart disease , serious active infection disease make patient unfit study participation assess investigator Other malignant disease within 5 year prior enrolment except nonmelanotic skin cancer carcinoma situ cervicis uteri Interstitial pneumonitis subsequent pulmonary fibrosis Pregnant breastfeed woman Largescale surgical intervention , excision biopsy significant traumatic lesion within 28 day prior treatment start presumption largescale surgery become necessary study treatment . Significant nonhealing wound ulcer Active hemorrhage increase risk hemorrhage ( e.g . tumor invasion large vessel know esophagus varix ) Known hypersensitivity panitumumab , bevacizumab auxiliary agent Grade IV fistula Uncontrolled hypertension , i.e . symptomatic hypertension nonmedically stabilize hypertension &gt; 160/100 Haemoptysis &gt; 2.5 ml within 2 week prior enrolment Previous serious unexpected reaction know hypersensitivity two apply cytostatics</criteria>
