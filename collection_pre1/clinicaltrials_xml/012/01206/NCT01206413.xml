	<brief_summary>The study investigate effectiveness home-based exercise combine slight caloric restriction weight change 12 month non-obese woman . In addition investigator evaluate effect baseline insulin resistance modulation weight change . A randomized clinical trial factorial design conduct 2003 2005 . Two hundred three middle-aged woman ( Rio de Janeiro/Brazil ) , 25-45 year , randomly assign one two group : control ( CG ) home-based exercise ( HB ) . The HB group receive booklet aerobic exercise could practice home ( 3 times/week - 40 min/session ) , low-moderate intensity , 12 month . Both group receive dietary counseling aim slight energy restriction 100-300 calorie per day . The HB experience great weight loss first 6 month ( -1.4 vs. -0.8 kg ; p=0.04 ) , 12 month difference group ( -1.1 vs. -1.0 ; p=0.20 ) . Of serum biochemical marker , HDL-cholesterol show major change , increase month 12 18.3 mg/dl HB compare 9.5 CG ( p &lt; 0.01 ) . At baseline non-IR group ( n=121 ) compare IR ( n=64 ) similar value BMI ( 26.7 vs. 26.3 p=0.21 ) , statistically significant low value waist , glucose , insulin HOMA-IR , expect . When group non-IR IR stratify GI diet , difference accord diet group . Women classify IR baseline great weight loss 12 month follow-up ( -1.62 kg vs. -1.08 kg ; p=0.01 ) , HB exercise help reduce weight among NIR woman ( -1.51 vs. -0.68 ; p=0.04 ) ; difference observe intervention group IR woman ( -1.54 vs. -1.66 ; p=0.24 ) . There differences IR NIR group lipid profile adjustment weight change . During follow-up , change pronounce among woman high GI diet . These difference statistically significant weight BMI great among IR compare non-IR . Changes HOMA-IR 3 month follow-up different compare non-IR IR baseline . The IR reduction HOMA-IR , whereas non-IR value increase ( -0.73 vs. +0.37 ; p= &lt; 0.001 ) . Also reduction great among high compare low GI diet ( p=0.04 ) .</brief_summary>
