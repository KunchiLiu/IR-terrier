	<brief_summary>Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( 75 % lung cancer ) associate involvement parietal pleura chest wall ( soft tissue and/or bone ) 5-8 % patient . Invasion chest wall increase T stag Tumor , Node , Mestasis ( TNM ) classification system lung cancer T3 associate decreased survival extensive operative procedure . The reported 5-year survival patient T2 tumor 58 % compare 38 % patient T3 lesion . The American college Chest Physician still identify best tool ass chest wall invasion lung cancer , CT-Scan use physician assessment . In study , CT scan show sensitivity range 42 % 68 % assess chest wall invasion , specificity range 66 % 100 % . Trans-thoracic Ultrasound ( US ) capacity allow dynamic real-time imaging pulmonary lesion chest wall . Therefore , US potential allow appreciation subtle finding relate movement lesion lung chest wall . Hence , US might accurate tool ass chest wall invasion lung cancer ; thus improve pre-operative diagnosis , stag operative planning patient chest wall invasion . However US currently utilize pre-operative assessment patient lung cancer invade pleura chest wall , extensively study . In rare study evaluate accuracy US , result show sensitivity range 89 % 100 % specificity range 95 % 98 % US detect chest wall invasion lung cancer . However study get criticize . Bandi et al study , get criticize fact operator study experienced interventional pulmonologists perform hundred thoracic endoscopic ultrasound per year . Nobuo et al study take place 1993 , since device US evolve , investigator apply certainty finding study . Consequently , need conduct study evaluate accuracy US ass chest wall invasion lung cancer . In prospective study investigator assess accuracy US , compare accuracy CT-Scan</brief_summary>
