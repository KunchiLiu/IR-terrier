	<detailed_description>In Phase I/II clinical trial , seek pilot addition HCQ standard front-line therapy colorectal cancer , FOLFOX/bevacizumab . In toxicity term , previous study lead u believe full dose ( 800mg ) HCQ welltolerated set . By start 600 mg , ensure full dose approach eye safety , need , use low dose . Both dos achieve autophagy inhibition current study : reason , comfortable include accrual dose-levels Phase II endpoint . If result particularly striking , consider amend study expand accrual budget permit , 25 patient permits adequate assessment activity novel regimen . The correlative endpoint trial direct pharmacokinetics HCQ , pharmacodynamics autophagy inhibition . We currently construct population pharmacokinetic model HCQ base data several ongoing trial , data patient contribute refine model . We analyze measure modelpredicted index relationship autophagy induction . Autophagy assess accumulation autophagocytic vesicle PMNs treat patient , together induction expression autophagyrelated protein western analysis , quantitated densitometry . An exploratory correlative endpoint induction metabolic change measure 18FDG-PET . Our mechanistic hypothesis work addition HCQ lead great amount cell death hypoxic region tumor , increase consequence bevacizumab treatment . We document rate metabolic response consequence treatment , therapeutic marker may relate degree autophagy inhibition . Finally , since demonistrated key role JNK1 induction autophagy , analyze archival tumor material determine variability marker , baseline potential future trial .</detailed_description>
