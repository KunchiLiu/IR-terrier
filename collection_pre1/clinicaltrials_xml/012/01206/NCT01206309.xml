	<brief_title>Immune Mediated Disorders After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) know curative option many hematologic disorder . After transplantation , many patient develop immune mediate disorder may life-threatening graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . The morbidity mortality associate HCT-associated immune mediate disorder major barrier successful use transplantation cure rare hematologic malignancy leukemia , lymphoma , multiple myeloma , myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndrome amongst disease . With study , investigator investigate biologic basis immune mediate disorder allogeneic HCT , focus develop cutaneous sclerosis , bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome , late acute GVHD chronic GVHD . The study enroll 1118 ( 1018 adult 100 child ) allogeneic HCT patient three year period . Subjects follow two year monitor closely development immune mediate disorder . This study 5 study visit day 1 , 100 , 180 , 365 , 730 . During visit , physical assessment , medication review , blood urine collection occur . If subject develop immune mediate disordered , monitor 3 month , 6 month , 1 year annually date diagnosis . During study visit , physical assessment , IMD status , medication review well blood urine collection occur .</detailed_description>
