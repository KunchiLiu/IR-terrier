	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Pralatrexate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving pralatrexate together fluorouracil may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose pralatrexate give together fluorouracil treat patient recurrent solid tumor</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pralatrexate Fluorouracil Treating Patients With Recurrent Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommend dose PDX ( pralatrexate ) give combination fix dose 5-FU ( fluorouracil ) administer 48-hour infusion give every week . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical response therapy subject measurable disease time disease progression subject . II . To assess toxicity profile combination PDX 5-FU . III . To determine pharmacokinetics PDX 5-FU correlate clinical toxicity . IV . To analyze polymorphisms methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase thymidylate synthase ( TS ) correlate clinical toxicity . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study pralatrexate . Patients receive pralatrexate intravenously ( IV ) 5 minute day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously 48 hour day 2 16 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
