	<brief_title>Effect Minimising Ultrasound Power 1 % During Cataract Surgery Corneal Endothelium .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corneal endothelial damage posterior capsular rupture two undesirable complication cataract surgery , infact significant loss endothelium lead corneal decompensation loss corneal clarity . However , degree endothelial cell loss inevitable cataract surgery . A loss 3.2 % -23.2 % show various study since 1967 . It well know cataract surgery many different factor generate endothelial damage , include impact nuclear fragment , turbulence generate anterior chamber volume liquid . It also relate amount ultrasonic energy use subsequent temperature rise , contact surgical instrument IOL implantation . It also depend release free radical length feature incision , surgical technique use . The risk endothelial cell density loss enhance surgeon deal high density cataract , shallow anterior chamber old age . Since time Kelman introduce technique phacoemulsification , constant conscious effort part phaco surgeon reduce phaco time bring alteration innovation personal technique introduce new technology procedure phacoemulsification . Development Laser emulsifier , SONAAR machine , introduction cold phaco modulation ultrasound form pulse , micropulse burst achievement towards attain end goal . Coaxial microphacoemulsification standard phacoemulsification technique practise globally cataract extraction many occasion intentionally use phaco power either fully per pre set limit . In fact use efficient fluidic control chopper minimizes use phaco energy . If could assess zero/minimal ultrasound technique scientific setting might achieve desire goal without resort major modification instrumentation machine . Coaxial MICS fully utilize advantage small incision provide comfortable platform surgeon use conventional phacoemulsification . We imagine ideal setting would introduce zero phaco power anterior chamber emulsify nucleus do already case Aqualase use warm fluid base system Howard Fines new technique mechanically emulsify lens rotators ( investigation ) . For undertook pilot study 10 patient perform coaxial microincision phacoemulsification , introduce ultrasound power incremental fashion surgery 10 patient till could achieve adequate aspiration fluid fragment . At zero power phacotip tube experience repeat blockage associate prolongation surgical time , thus increment one percent make sit . To surprise , first step introduce 1 % ultrasound power make difference.No increment require technique nuclear management lens aspiration conveniently possible setting . The procedure aspiration fragment smooth continuous , also cause reduction surgical time comparison zero power phaco.The case reveal less corneal endothelial trauma comparison conventional phacoemulsification use high power setting . The surprising observation could dissemble nucleus know technique nucleus fragmentation ( stop chop , divide conquer , phaco-chop ) almost grades cataract .Possibly high vaccum 300-350 responsible nuclear fragmentation cavitational effect ultrasound power . Keeping parameter uniform wish design RCT study effect eliminate phaco power . With view , study compare endothelial status addition various complication visual outcome follow standard coaxial microincision cataract surgery coaxial microincision cataract surgery use 1 % ultrasound .</detailed_description>
