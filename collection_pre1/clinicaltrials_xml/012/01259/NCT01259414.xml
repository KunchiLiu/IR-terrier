	<brief_summary>TACE consider standard treatment unresectable HCC widely use palliative treatment . However consensus protocol TACE.One variation stability suspension emulsify lipiodol contrast medium use dissolve anticancer agent really effect survival.Thus investigator conduct prospective , randomize control study find different method prepare chemotheraputic drug cause different survival benefit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Solvents Used With Chemotherapy Agent Transarterial Chemoembolization Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization currently mainstays palliative treatment worldwide patient unresectable HCC . However standard protocol exist TACE currently . One controversy way emulsified anticancer agent lipiodol get high stability suspension really effect survival rate . Anticancer drug play important role survival benefit . Many study innovate different method get high stability suspension lipiodol anticancer drug , think lipiodol selectively retain HCC use drug-carrying allow slow release anticancer drug lipiodol microdroplets . Thus , A stability suspension might get maximize tumor drug uptake , cause tumor necrosis , minimize systemic drug level , get less toxicity , hence survival benefit . While researcher think stability emulsion ca n't get positive effect , pharmacokinetic systematic toxicity anticancer drug , tumor response , biologic response .</detailed_description>
