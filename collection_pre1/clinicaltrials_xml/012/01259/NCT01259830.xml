	<detailed_description>A fast-track program evidence-based , multimodal approach patient undergoing surgery reduce perioperative morbidity , hospital stay cost increase patient center well-being . Particularly visceral surgery colon gain widespread acceptance ( Schwenk 2009 ) . Optimized pain relief core component fast-track regimen ( Kehlet Wilmore 2008 ) . In context epidural analgesia become standard care early postoperative pain therapy ( Hasenberg 2009 ) , provide superior pain relief compare parenteral opioids ( Block 2001 ) . However , debate whether non-opioid analgesic give adjunct epidural analgesia already present . Some study find reduce pain use NSAID adjunct ( Scott 1994 ) , lead positive recommendation German guideline postoperative pain therapy ( S3-Leitlinie ) . However , study ( Mogensen 1992 ) find effect non-opioids addition epidural analgesia . Further study also need ass whether nonopioid adjunct facilitate change epidural systemic analgesia ( typically 2nd 3rd postoperative day ) reduce opioid consumption day catheter removal . Fast-track surgery multi-model process , every step process need fine-tuned yield best result ( Langelotz 2005 ) . Until study compare group either epidural systemic analgesia , optimal recovery sequential approach combination probably well choice . A typical multimodal analgesia regimen removal epidural institution consist acetaminophen ibuprofen . Opioids avoid possible , add need . An improved non-opioid analgesia regimen sought-after goal fast-track-phase . The study control term type surgery ( laparoscopic colon rectal surgery ) factor multimodal analgesia treatment .</detailed_description>
