	<brief_title>A Representational Intervention Promote Preparation End-of-life Decision Making</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dialysis central survival 450,000 Americans end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Yet patient dialysis significant comorbidities high mortality rate ( 24 % annually ) . One four ESRD patient death occur decision stop dialysis . However , person lose decision capacity prior discussion patient surrogate regard goal care , issue whether continue dialysis pose ethical impasse cause profound psychological distress surrogate decision maker . Using representational approach patient education , develop pilot test SPIRIT intervention ( Sharing Patient 's Illness Representation Increase Trust ) improve discussion end-of-life care patient surrogate decision maker . SPIRIT 6-step , 2-session , face-to-face intervention present patient surrogate train interventionist interview format . The propose randomized control trial test effect SPIRIT intervention improve preparedness end-of-life decision making among ESRD patient surrogates reduce surrogate ' conflict decision make psychosocial morbidity . Subjects 200 Caucasian African-American patient ESRD recruit outpatient dialysis clinic choose surrogate decision maker . Preparedness outcomes ( dyad congruence , patient decisional conflict , surrogate decision make confidence ) measure 2 , 6 , 12 month post-intervention . Surrogate decisional conflict psychosocial morbidity ( anxiety , depression , post-traumatic distress symptom ) measure 2 week patient 's hospitalization require surrogate decision making . To compare effect SPIRIT standard care surrogates patient 's death , psychosocial morbidity measure 3 6 month patient 's death . We also explore potential impact race intervention effect examine mediator moderator intervention effect .</detailed_description>
