	<detailed_description>Background : Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) highly prevalent Veteran population give risk factor male gender , overweight , increase age . OSA cause upper airway obstruction , result arousal sleep hypoxia . While continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) highly efficacious treatment OSA , compliance treatment suboptimal . Because research show adherence pattern establish early treatment , seek use technology enable early frequent productive interaction patient provider Objectives : The objective proposal explore feasibility initially evaluate potential efficacy video teleconferencing system patient Obstructive Sleep Apnea syndrome ( OSA ) facilitate patient- centered , collaborative management patient prescribe gold-standard treatment , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . Methods : The evaluative aspect proposal design pilot randomize , control clinical trial Video Teleconferencing ( VTC ) compare Usual Care ( UC ) . The key feature Video Teleconferencing intervention use telemedicine system allow audio/visual conferencing patient home environment start treatment initialization . The provider able provide direct feedback patient base telemedicine interaction , patient benefit increase contact provider . Specific inclusion exclusion criterion include : age &gt; 18 year ; confirm diagnosis moderate-severe OSA ; newly prescribe CPAP therapy ; chronic symptom note screen symptom checklist ; fluency English . Patients recruit VA San Diego Healthcare System Pulmonary Sleep Clinic . Patients enrol 2-month time period . Groups compare quantitative qualitative measure . Status : Study Complete</detailed_description>
