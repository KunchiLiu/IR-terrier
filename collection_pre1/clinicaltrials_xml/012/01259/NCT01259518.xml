	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study TriN2755 Advanced Solid Tumors Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Classical chemotherapeutic agent include class alkylating agent covalent modification biopolymers particular , base DNA , propose mechanism cytotoxic action . Bifunctional alkylating agent , yield inter- intrastrand cross-link include nitrogen mustard , mitomycin C platinum complex . In contrast , monofunctional alkylating agent act react single electron-rich site base DNA strand . The prominent class latter group triazene , base nitrogen-rich chemistry . It generally accept triazenes , upon metabolic activation via N demethylation , yield highly reactive carbocations , covalently bind biopolymers . The novel triazene TriN 2755 differs triazenes physicochemical property high hydrophilicity photostability , particular potent , dose dependent antitumor activity spectrum cancer include dacarbazine-resistant tumor , treatment option metastatic disease still satisfactory medical need exist . This open-label , parallel-group , two-center , safety , activity pharmacokinetic study TriN 2755 give increase dose level intravenous infusion administer 4 hour . The study divide two part : Part I dose escalation phase Part II extension phase . Part I Study ( Dose Escalation Phase ) : In first part study , two treatment schedule investigate parallel : Treatment schedule A : The study medication infuse every 28 day 4-week cycle ( Group A ) Treatment schedule B : The study medication infuse every 7 day 4-week cycle ( Group B ) In treatment schedule A ( Group A ) , plan start dose investigate 25 mg TriN 2755 give follow recovery period 4 week . Subsequent patient include new dose level safety review patient include precede dose level ( ) Day 28 infusion ( end Cycle 1 ) indicate relevant toxicity . In treatment schedule B ( Group B ) , plan start dose investigate 800mg , give every 7 day 4 week cycle . Subsequent patient include new dose level safety review patient include precede dose level ( ) Day 28 start first infusion ( end Cycle 1 ) indicate relevant toxicity . Plasma sample evaluate pharmacokinetics TriN 2755 collect predefined schedule first administration dose level pre-dose expect peak time subsequent administration within first treatment cycle ( Group B ) . Urine sample collect 24 hour first administration dose level within first treatment cycle . Once MTD reach , two expand cohort patient treat Maximum Recommended Dose ( MRD ) one dose level MTD low dose level , indicate . This second part study ( expansion ) allow enrolment approximately additional 9 patient per treatment schedule , choose dose , order well ass safety possible antitumor activity TriN 2755 . The exact number patient enrol expanded phase decide Monitoring Board . The patient treat near plan phase II dose , without expand prolong study excessively .</detailed_description>
