	<brief_title>Effectiveness Incorporating Tai Chi Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients Primary Health Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects : 192 patient enrol recruit four General Out-patient clinic Yau Tsim Mong Wong Tai Sin district . Study Design : Prospective single blind randomize control trial Subjects randomize Pulmonary rehabilitation program ( PRP ) group ( n = 98 ) Pulmonary rehabilitation program Tai chi group ( TC ) ( n=94 ) . Details PRP PRP + Tai Chi discuss . Both group give booklet COPD information management . Randomization : Computer generate pre-assigned randomization subject group allocation make baseline assessment . At stage , assessor outcome measure data collection blind patient 's grouping . Patients , investigator physiotherapist open group allocation . Standardized medical treatment : All COPD patient manage accord practical guideline recommend Hospital Authority . Medical treatment review change clinically appropriate . In response exacerbation , antibiotic add respiratory infection cause oral steroid may prescribe clinically indicate . Measurement Evaluation Baseline assessment : 1 . Medical aspect : GOLD stag COPD ; Baseline spirometry test include bronchodilator reversibility test . 2 . Self-Efficacy : COPD Self Efficacy Scale ( CSES ) ; Self-Efficacy Managing Shortness Breath ( SEMSOB ) 3 . Quality life related measure : St. George Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) 4 . Exercise Capacity : 6 Minutes Walking Distance Test ( 6MWT ) Reassessment do 2 month 6 month use : 1 . Primary Outcome measure Secondary measure outcome mention outcome measure 2 . Spirometry exclusive bronchodilator reversibility test Statistical method Descriptive statistic include mean , standard deviation , frequency percentage use describe demographic characteristic summarize baseline characteristic variable . Independent T-test use examine difference demographic characteristic baseline outcome measure PRP TC group . Paired T-test perform examine difference outcome measure , include spirometry , 6 MWT , SGRQ-HKC , CSES , SEMSOB intervention program within group . Analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) use examine difference outcome variable PRP TC group adjust age , sex , body mass index BMI , smoke education , correspond baseline value covariate . A p-value 0.05 w use level statistical significance . Confidence interval ( 95 % ) mean difference baseline 6 month post intervention value calculate compare effect minimum clinically important difference ( MCID ) SGRQ-HKC . All analysis conduct use Statistical package Social Sciences SPSS version 16.0 . Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programme ( PRP ) Details : The revise PRP consist 12 session ( twice per week 6 week ) 6-10 subject per session . The standard content consist physical training include warm &amp; cool exercise aerobic exercise . For PRP group , patient perform 5 minute warm exercise . Then 2 aerobic activity include treadmill exercise lower limb ergometry exercise last 20 minute , prescribe . 15 minute rest give exercise . After aerobic exercise , 5 minute cool exercise , follow 15 minute relaxation exercise conduct patient complete session . Each session last 1 hour 20 minutes.They instruct continue unsupervised home exercise consist 5 minute warm-up , 5 minute Thera-Band strengthening exercise , 30 minute aerobic exercise , 5 minute cool 15 minute relaxation exercise least one hour 5-7 days/week . For PRP + Tai Chi group , exercise content totally identical PRP group except 15 minute Tai Chi exercise substitute 15 minute relaxation exercise . Each session also last 1 hour 20 minute . The 5 form Suen Style Tai Chi choose encourage large limbs movement well chest wall movement incorporate diaphragmatic breathe breathe control . Details 5 form Sun Style Tai Chi chosen : 1. commence form 2. single whip : leave right 3. turn slant fly : leave right 4. wave hand like cloud : leave right 5. move shut door The exercise intensity level aerobic activity set target heart rate 60-70 % maximum heart rate rate perceive dyspnea ( RPD ) level 7 . Vital sign monitor , &amp; exercise ensure exercise heart rate exceed target level . Also , time patient feel discomfort RPD level reach 7 , exercise stop patient allow rest .</detailed_description>
