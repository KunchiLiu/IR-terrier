	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether neurofeedback ( NF ) train significantly reduce symptom Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) individual significant affect dysregulation chronic , treatment-resistant PTSD . The primary aim study include : 1 . To examine whether NF potential significantly reduce symptom PTSD . 2 . To examine whether NF train specifically target area affect regulation . 3 . To examine mechanism NF elucidate relationship affect regulation PTSD symptom change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Deficits affect regulation associate high rate treatment failure well-established evidence-based treatment Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) , deficit domain frequently find individual chronic treatment-resistant PTSD . Aside one psychological treatment intervention adult female survivor child sexual abuse , publish study target improve affect regulation treatment refractory PTSD . The aim study test refine EEG neurofeedback ( NF ) effective treatment PTSD associate high level affect dysregulation . We believe improve affect regulation lead overall improvement function address deficit executive function PTSD . Primary Aim : The primary goal research refine evaluate NF training adult treatment-resistant PTSD , specifically target domain affect regulation . We evaluate follow question : 1 . Will NF decrease chronic PTSD symptom treatment-resistant sample adult childhood onset PTSD , measure CAPS DTS ? Hypothesis 1 : Subjects active treatment condition show significantly great decrease CAPS DTS subject placebo condition . 2 . Will NF improve affect regulation , measure IASC ? Hypothesis 2 : Subjects active treatment condition show significantly great improvement affect dysregulation subscale IASC individual placebo condition . 3 . Will affect regulation , measure IASC , mediate relationship NF training PTSD , measure DTS ? Hypothesis 3 : The affect dysregulation subscale IASC significantly mediate relationship NF DTS score DTS score significantly mediate affect dysregulation .</detailed_description>
