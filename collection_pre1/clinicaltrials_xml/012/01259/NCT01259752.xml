	<brief_title>Compression Stockings Ankle Sprain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Ankle sprain frequently encounter trauma lesion emergency department associate important health expense . However , appropriate care trauma lesion remain matter debate . Hypothesis : The tested hypothesis compression stocking enable reduce median recovery ankle sprain least 6 day . Main end point : Delay recovery normal painless walking , without analgesic drug consumption . Secondary end point : Pain rest walk use visual analog pain scale , bimalleolar middle-feet perimeter , number day analgesic drug consumption , observance analysis , patient 's tolerance use visual analog scale , delay recover sport activity subgroup patient regular sport activity . Methods : Multicenter Prospective randomize superiority control trial compare leg stocking standard care standard care ankle sprain . Standard care include RICE ( Rest , Ice , Compression , Elevation ) protocol admission , immobilization ankle bracing ( 3 6 week duration accord severity clinical course ) , recommendation walking ( weight baring , partial weight bearing , total weight bearing ) , administration analgesic drug . The medical device test present study class II compressive stocking ( compression 15 20 mmHg ) . Number patient : With alpha risk 5 % , beta risk 5 % , 70 patient include group able detect 6 day difference delay recovery , define normal painless walk without analgesic drug consumption , take consideration 10 % patient lose follow . Criteria inclusion : Recent ( &lt; 48h ) ankle sprain without fracture without traumatic lesion adult patient age 18 55 year . Patients limb arterial disease , diabetes , disease expect potentially interfere recovery walking , exclude well pregnant woman . Study schedule : Inclusion first visit emergency department , day 7 , 15-21 , 30-45 , 90 . Phone call interview perform define appropriate timing visit .</detailed_description>
