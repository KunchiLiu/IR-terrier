	<detailed_description>Background rational 1 . Definition Low back pain clinical condition characterize pain felt bottom edge costal arch inferior gluteus fold , sometimes radiate back side thigh . It may responsible functional limitation inability perform normal activity daily live . Low back pain define acute symptom duration le 4 week , sub-acute duration 4 week 3 month , chronic last beyond 3 month . It consider recurrent episode shorter 4 week alternate period relief pain . 2 . Epidemiology Low Back Pain common musculo-skeletal disorder , , along common cold , frequent disease among human . Up 60-80 % population expect suffer Low Back Pain time life . Annual prevalence Low Back Pain range 30 50 % amongst people work period life ; individual , percentage 15 20 % necessitate medical assistance . Low Back Pain fifth-ranking cause medical referral second symptomatic condition . A proportion range 25 50 % patient acute Low Back Pain suffer new pain episode follow year 6-10 % progress toward chronic form.Chronic Low Back Pain responsible 75 % medical expense make treatment type Low Back Pain . Direct annual cost ( medication , medical visit , physiotherapy , hospitalization ) Chronic Low Back Pain estimate approximately € 3.100 patient ( year 2002 ) ; indirect cost , mainly due absence work , represent 85 % total cost match € 17.600 patient year . In conclusion , Chronic Low Back Pain disease high prevalence incidence , evenly affect men woman 30 's 50 's , extremely costly individual society , term diagnostic intervention treatment , reduction productivity functional limitation everyday life . 3 . Non-Pharmacologic treatment Non-Pharmacologic treatment Chronic Low Back Pain include : acupuncture , back school , psychological intervention , functional restoration , interdisciplinary rehabilitation , interferential therapy , low-level laser therapy , lumbar support , massage , short wave diathermy , spinal manipulation , traction , superficial heat , transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) , ultrasound therapy , yoga physical exercise . A recent meta-analysis base 43 clinical control trial involve 3.907 subject Chronic Low Back Pain demonstrate physical exercise effective reduce pain improve functional level . The recent Guidelines , publish October 20007 , underline , along cognitive-behavioural therapy , spinal manipulation interdisciplinary rehabilitation , physical exercise non pharmacologic treatment positive effect Chronic ( subacute ) Low Back Pain . 4 . Vertebral instability physical exercise Several theory link etiology Low Back Pain clinical sign symptom mechanical instability lumbar spine . Stability lumbar spine require passive stiffness , osseous ligamentous structure , active stiffness , `` core '' muscle , rectus abdominis , external oblique , internal oblique , transversus abdominis , quadratus lumborum , multifidi , psoas major , iliocostalis , gluteus major . It show therapeutic exercise improve vertebral stability stretch strengthen `` core '' muscle , also enhance neuromuscular proprioceptive facilitation . This reason physical exercise program usually include strengthen trunk-stabilizing exercise . 5 . Joba® Core Trainer Joba® Core Trainer gym equipment make use counterbalance principle efficiently engage trunk muscle , include abdominal trunk extensor . This equipment prove effective improve cardio-respiratory fitness level , increase rest energy expenditure , reduce weight enhance glycaemic control diabetic patient . Furthermore significantly strengthen diverse muscular group ( abdominal , trunk extensor , abductor , thigh flexor extensor ) . Thus Core Trainer Joba® may represent valuable alternative traditional physical exercise protocol treatment subject Chronic Low Back Pain 6 . Study purpose The purpose study ass whether train program base Joba® Core Trainer effective reduce pain improve physical function quality life subject suffer Chronic Low Back Pain . 7 . Materials Methods 7a ) Study design Randomized , one centre , single-blinded , clinical trial three arm : JOBA group ( train JOBA® Core Trainer ) , BACK group ( train traditional protocol Therapeutic Physical Exercise ) Control group sedentary people undergo usual care ( C ) . 7b ) Subjects Subject attend Physiatrist Geriatric Outpatient Clinics Department Gerontology , Geriatric Physiatrist Sciences University Hospital `` Agostino Gemelli '' ( Rome , Italy ) non-specific Low Back Pain , without sciatic irradiation , least 3 month . Exclusion criterion : functional neurosensorial limitation contraindicate impede attend physical exercise program ( spondilolystesis high first degree , disk herniation recent 6 month , disk herniation surgical intervention indicate , previous surgical intervention spine , cognitive deterioration , terminal prognosis ) . 7c ) Main outcome Perceived pain intensity . 7d ) Secondary outcome 1 . Quality life 2 . Level physical function 3 . Level physical activity everyday life 4 . Neuro-muscular proprioceptive control trunk-stabilizing muscle 5 . Medication use/medical visit . 7e ) Duration Twelve week . 8 ) Study phase 8a ) Screening visit enrolment Subjects enrol study individuate visit carry Physiatrist Geriatric Outpatient Clinics Department . Eligible subject inform scope method study ; accept participate sign informed consent . 8b ) Baseline assessment Patients undergo thorough medical visit ( medical history , medication use , physical examination ) . The intensity perceive low back pain , level physical functioning , quality life measure ( Mc Gill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form , Visual Analogue Scale , Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire , Short-Form 36 , respectively ) .The level physical activity everyday life ( daily energy expenditure , physical activity &gt; 3 METs duration , active energy expenditure , average METs , number step , etc . ) assess mean Metabolic Holter ( Armband® ) period least five consecutive days.Proprioceptive neuro-muscular control trunk muscle evaluate mean stabilometric , computerized table ( Libra® ) . 8c ) Randomization Subjects allocate one three study group accord computerized randomization procedure block variable length . 8d ) Intervention 1 . JOBA Group : 3 session per week JOBA® Core Trainer . Each session last 45 minute ( 5-7 minute stretching exercise , 31 ' minute JOBA , 5-7 minute stretch exercise ) . Speed JOBA movement progressively increase study period . All training session take place Fitness Centre University Hospital `` A. Gemelli '' . 2 . BACK Group : 2 session per week ( 55 minute ) calistenic gymnastic stretching , dynamic stabilization , strengthen trunk-stabilizing muscle , accord standardized training protocol supervision qualify technical personnel Fitness Centre . 3 . Control Group ( C ) : usual medical care accord fore mentioned Outpatient Clinic standard . 8e ) Intermediate assessment After 6 week , pain intensity , physical functioning , quality life re-evaluated ; drug use medical visit occur baseline record . 8f ) Final assessment After 12 week , subject undergo complete medical visit new functional evaluation accordin procedure already depict baseline ( pain , physical function , quality life , physical activity , proprioceptive control trunk , care-associated cost ) . Blinding Due characteristic intervention , participant aware specific group allocate ( either traditional training JOBA usual care ) . However , baseline , intermediate , final assessment carry field researcher ( medicine doctor ) uninformed allocation arm subject . Sample size According literature data hypothesize intervention produce 20 ( per cent ) point increase pain scale respect control ; use probability type I error 5 % ( alfa=0.05 , single-sided ) power 80 % ( beta=0.20 ) , estimate group include 12 subject ( total sample size 12x3=36 ) . 9 ) Analisi statistica Statistical analysis carry intention-to-treat approach . Statistical analysis carry use statistical software package SPSS/PC Vers . 18 .</detailed_description>
