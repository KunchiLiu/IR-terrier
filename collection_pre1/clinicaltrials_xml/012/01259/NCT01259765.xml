	<detailed_description>Brief Summary Study investigate efficacy oral administration VHH antibody fragment derive antibody find milk llama camel via prototype food product reduce severity rotavirus diarrhoea child . Detailed Description Introduction Rotavirus lead viral enteropathogen , responsible 11-71 % diarrhoea episodes infant child worldwide . In develop country , rotavirus associate 125 million episode diarrhoea year ( Cook et al . 1990 ) , lead estimate 600,000 death . It responsible 60 % diarrhoeal episode , 20-60 % diarrhoeal hospitalization , 20 % diarrhoea-related death child &lt; 5 year age ( Perez-Schael et al . 1997 ) . In United States America alone , rotavirus associate 3 % hospitalization child young 5 year medical indirect cost US $ 1 billion year ( Glass et al . 1991 ) . In many locality death rotavirus infection persist despite national program encourage use oral rehydration therapy . Current management rotavirus gastroenteritis Current management rotavirus diarrhoea include prevention dehydration , management dehydration use oral intravenous rehydration , appropriate , continue feed . Early resumption normal feed encouraged enhance mucosal repair minimize nutritional consequence infection . The child develop country might benefit zinc supplementation , mode delivery cost effectiveness yet decide rotavirus diarrhoea . No specific treatment currently available reduce duration severity illness . Therefore , rotavirus-induced diarrhoea , consider self-limited disease , responsible significant childhood death develop country ( Glass et al . 1996 ) . Active immunization rotavirus infection The development , test eventual use effective , safe inexpensive rotavirus vaccine would efficient method prevent severe disease death develop country . Rapid progress make , several candidate rotavirus vaccine develop test . Two rotavirus vaccine , Rotarix ( GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals , Belgium ) RotaTeq ( Merck &amp; Co. , USA ) recently enter market develop world . Both vaccine appear safe respect intussusception , highly efficacious prevent severe gastroenteritis due rotavirus strain carry predominantly serotype G1 ( Cunliffe &amp; Nakagomi 2005 ) . Confirmation safety efficacy vaccine develop country still need . Moreover , assessment ability vaccine provide protection increasingly diverse population rotavirus strain depend continuous surveillance strain development new vaccine new serotypes predominate different geographical location , may easy develop country . There thus clear need define improve , cost effective intervention management rotavirus diarrhoea time effective , safe inexpensive vaccine , affordable develop country , available . Passive immunisation rotavirus-induced diarrhoea ; There good reason hypothesize passive immunisation could useful management human rotavirus diarrhoea . For example , oral administration rotavirus-neutralizing antibody find modulate rotavirus-induced diarrhoea child . Beneficial prophylactic ( Barnes et al . 1982 ) therapeutic effect ( Guarino et al . 1991 ) , term reduction duration severity rotavirus diarrhoea , also observe association orally administer human IgG preparation . The use human antibody preparation , however , limit due risk viral contamination high production supply chain cost product ( ) low bio-availability . An alternative source antibody , safe easy produce , later develop hyper immunized bovine colostrum vaccinate pregnant cow human strain rotavirus . This approach also effectively use prophylactic ( Davidsson et al . 1989 ) therapeutic benefit ( Mitra et al . 1995 , Sarker et al . 1998 ) rotavirus diarrhoea hospitalize child . In recently conclude study child rotavirus diarrhoea Bangladesh , observe modest benefit oral administration immunoglobulin extract egg chicken immunized human strain rotavirus ( Sarker et al . 2001 ) . Passive immunization prevention treatment enteric infection generally require relatively large amount antibody , particularly mucosal sit antibody rapidly clear . Therefore , modality , although proven effective , become expensive due requirement large dose antibody . The limitation conventional IgG antibody include poor stability complex nature limit large-scale production . A promising solution problem large-scale antibody production come , rather unexpectedly , nature itself- camel llama posse unusual type IgG antibody ( IgG2 IgG3 ) devoid light chains- `` heavy chain '' antibody . Selection heavy chain antibody fragment In llama camel , `` heavy chain '' IgG antibodies co-exist `` conventional '' IgG ( IgG1 ) ( Hamers-Casterman et al . 1993 ) . In contrast conventional antibody , heavy chain antibody devoid light chain . Therefore , bind domain heavy chain antibody consist variable domain heavy chain ( VHH ) contrast bind domain conventional antibody consist variable domain heavy chain ( VH ) one light chain ( VL ) . The biochemical property llama VHH antibody fragment superior Fv fragment ( VH + VL ) conventional IgG antibody . Although VHH antibody fragment simple antigen binding structure one domain , possess high affinity , extremely thermostable ( van der Linden et al. , 1999 ) . Furthermore , well express secrete baker yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , allow large-scale cost effective production ( Frenken et al. , 2000 ) . This process make VHH fragment affordable ingredient food product widen availability general population develop country . VHH potential food ingredient Many people African/Arabic country regularly consume camel milk . In 1992 , observe camel milk contains high titre antibody rotavirus ( el Agamy et al 1992 ) .The antibody fragment VHH batch 203027 fragment antibody assume present camel/llama milk . Thus , investigational product classify food ingredient As start 1999 , aim Unilever 's `` VHH '' project develop affordable food develop country , `` may help reduce risk rotavirus infection '' . This type claim fit well definition put forward European Union-sponsored Concerted Action Functional Foods Science Europe ( FUFOSE ) ( Diplock et al 1999 ) . The FUFOSE terminology 's 'enhanced function ' ( type A ) 'reduction risk disease ' ( type B ) claim widely adapt many national international code practice , include Codex Alimentarius . It especially develop 1990 's allow delineation functional food drug . In context , would also like refer EC Regulation No 258/97 European Parliament Council 27 January 1997 concern novel food novel food ingredient EU regulation 1924/2006 nutrition health claim make food . The efficacy VHH fragment reduce risk develop rotavirus diarrhoea supply food format test additional trial Safety application VHH antibody fragment Safety oral application VHH antibody fragment proven two study execute Netherlands Bangladesh , include adult child age 6 month . Comparison : We compare effect VHH antibody fragment placebo child proven rotavirus diarrhoea hospitalize ICDDR , B . This intervention top standard treatment , include oral rehydration treatment .</detailed_description>
