	<brief_summary>Background : - Cisplatin carboplatin standard cancer treatment drug use various childhood cancer , include brain tumor . Both drug frequently severe side effect may reduce effectiveness , particularly child , new treatment need may similarly effective less toxic cancer patient . - Satraplatin experimental drug , similar cisplatin carboplatin , yet approve Food Drug Administration . Satraplatin show treat cancer interfere genetic material ( DNA ) cancer cell . Some adult cancer receive satraplatin slow growth shrinkage tumor . Researchers interested determine whether satraplatin effective cancer occur child . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness satraplatin treatment child young adult solid tumor respond standard treatment . - To study effect satraplatin body term side effect blood chemistry . - To examine effect genetic variation may effectiveness satraplatin . Eligibility : - Children , adolescent , young adult 3 21 year age solid tumor ( include brain tumor ) respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen full physical examination medical history , blood test , tumor image study . - Participants receive satraplatin pill take every day morning 5 consecutive day , food 2 hour 1 hour dose . Participants 23 day without drug complete 28-day cycle treatment . Participants also receive medication prevent nausea vomit 30 minute first dose satraplatin . Following first dose satraplatin , medication nausea give need . - Satraplatin dos adjust base response treatment , include potential side effect . Participants frequent blood test image study evaluate effectiveness treatment monitor side effect , well hear test examination require study researcher . - Participants receive satraplatin every 4 week 2 year serious side effect occur tumor stop respond treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND The platinum compound cisplatin carboplatin standard agent treatment variety childhood cancer . However , cumulative long-term renal ototoxicity concern relate cisplatin administration , particularly young child . Several mechanism resistance platinum compound describe include decreased drug accumulation due alter drug uptake presence membrane efflux pump , increase intracellular level thiol-containing group detoxify modulate platinum , removal platinum-DNA adduct DNA repair pathway call nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) base excision repair ( BER ) pathways . Polymorphisms DNA repair gene show cancer predict well treatment response platinum treatment . Satraplatin oral platinum analog similar preclinical vitro vivo activity cisplatin carboplatin , activity platinum resistant model . Dose-limiting satraplatin toxicity adult include nausea , vomit , myelosuppression . Neither renal neurologic toxicity describe . Satraplatin demonstrate clinical activity adult refractory tumor recommend phase II III dose 80 mg/m2/dose daily 5 day every 28 35 day . OBJECTIVES To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) oral satraplatin administer daily 5 day every 28 day schedule pediatric patient relapse refractory solid tumor include brain tumor . To define toxicity oral satraplatin characterize pharmacokinetics oral satraplatin child refractory cancer . To determine preliminary antitumor activity satraplatin . To evaluate pharmacogenomic expression DNA repair gene peripheral blood mononuclear blood cell . ELIGIBILITY Patients great equal 3 year less equal 25 year enrollment relapse refractory solid tumor include brain tumor . Adequate organ function DESIGN This phase I trial satraplatin administer daily orally 5 day every 28 day . A cycle therapy consider 28 day . The start dose level 60 mg/m ( 2 ) /dose escalation 80 , 110 , 140 mg/m ( 2 ) /dose . The MTD define base satraplatin tolerability cycle one . Disease status evaluate prior every odd treatment cycle therapy may continue 2 year absence progressive disease unacceptable toxicity . Plasma pharmacokinetics pharmacogenomics evaluate first treatment cycle .</detailed_description>
