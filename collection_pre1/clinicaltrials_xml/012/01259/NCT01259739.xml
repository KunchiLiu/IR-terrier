	<brief_summary>The purpose study characterize potential improvement cocoa flavanols exercise capacity highly trained cyclist . A placebo-controlled double-blinded randomize control study perform 13 highly trained cyclist ( crossover design ) . Participants perform baseline exercise test ergometer . They receive either flavanol-poor flavanol rich cocoa drink twice daily one week second third exercise testing perform . The order drink randomize balance ( high-flavanol -- &gt; low-flavanol drink low-flavanol drink -- &gt; high-flavanol drink )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>13 participant ( highly-trained cyclist , accustom exercise test ergometer enrol ( VO2max &gt; 50 ml/kg , FMD &gt; 5 % , non-smokers , medication , disease , age 20-36 , male ) . Baseline Testing : Participants perform baseline test consist ergometric test step-wise increase workload exhaustion determine lactate anaerobic threshold cardio-pulmonary exercise capacity . Vascular function monitor Doppler Ultrasound . In second test , participant perform time trial ( goal : fast possible ) Flavanol intervention Participants twice daily receive either flavanol-poor cocoa drink ( 13mg/dl ) flavanol-rich cocoa drink ( 596mg/dl ) period 7 day . Order randomize balance . Subjects crossover second arm washout period 7 day . Testing performed baseline day repeat intake drink In subgroup n=6 participant , test whether blood pressure cuff maneuver use FMD modify nitrite level . For manuever complete 4 time compare n=6 untreated control . another subgroup 6 participant receive 4times maneuver reperfusion limit mean ultrasound probe .</detailed_description>
