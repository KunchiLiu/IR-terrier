	<brief_summary>This research look two condition , Essential Thrombocythemia ( ET ) Polycythemia Vera ( PV ) . ET cause people produce many blood cell call platelet PV cause many platelet red blood cell make . Platelets particles circulate blood stream normally prevent bleed bruising . Having many platelet blood increase risk develop blood clot , result life threaten event like heart attack stroke . When number red blood cell increase PV slow speed blood flow body increase risk develop blood clot . The purpose study look effectiveness give participant diagnose ET PV one two different study regimen time . The study subject follow condition 5 year . The subject randomized one two study regimen , either Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a ( PEGASYS ) Aspirin Hydroxyurea ( also call Hydroxycarbamide ) . The subject must newly diagnose already receive treatment either PV ET . Each study drug use study already use treat subject ET PV currently , investigator unsure study drug well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a Versus Hydroxyurea Polycythemia Vera ( PV ) Essential Thrombocythemia ( ET )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Philadelphia chromosome negative myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPN ) group clonal hematological malignancy characterize chronic course punctuate number disease related event include thrombosis , hemorrhage , pruritis leukemic transformation . These disorder include Polycythemia Vera ( PV ) , Essential Thrombocythemia ( ET ) Primary Myelofibrosis ( PM ) . Recently acquire somatic mutation intracellular kinase , JAK2 ( JAK2V617F ) observe 95 % patient PV , 50 % patient ET 50 % patient primary myelofibrosis . At present chemotherapeutic agent hydroxyurea standard care high risk patient PV . Concern exist prolong use drug lead leukemia inability hydroxyurea eliminate malignant clone . Interferon ( rIFN -2b ) , drug appear non-leukemogenic , may preferential activity malignant clone PV , suggest cytogenetic remission obtain patient treated rIFN -2b . Several investigator recently report patient PV treat rIFN -2b low JAK2V617F allele burden compare control group include patient treated phlebotomy , hydroxyurea , anagrelide , remain untreated . The result confirm hypothesis rIFN -2b preferentially target malignant clone PV raise possibility JAK2V617F allele burden , reversion clonal hematopoiesis monitor female expression X-chromosome polymorphic allele maybe useful monitoring minimal residual disease PV patient . Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a ( PEGASYS ) demonstrate phase II trial patient PV ET clinical efficacy measure normalization myeloproliferation , lack vascular event therapy , decrease JAK2V617F allele burden . Overall tolerability therapy good , trial dropout rate secondary toxicity le 10 % enrol . Although dropout rate toxicity low , say therapy without symptomatic toxicity , indeed spectrum toxicity might encounter need weigh analysis net clinical benefit patient experience clinical trial Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a . A new MPN assessment form utilized study . This 19 item instrument include previously validate 9 item brief fatigue inventory ( BFI ) , symptom related splenomegaly , inactivity , cough , night sweat , pruritus , bone pain , fever , weight loss , overall quality life assessment . The instrument yield independent result symptom ( fatigue composite score ) , methodology ( linear analog scale assessment [ LASA ] ) proven valid past . This instrument validate prospectively ( comparison panel instrument contain aspect MPN-SAF ) administration single time point . This randomized trial hydroxyurea Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a , open label clinical trial two independent disease stratum : ( 1 ) high risk polycythemia vera ( 2 ) high risk essential thrombocythemia .</detailed_description>
