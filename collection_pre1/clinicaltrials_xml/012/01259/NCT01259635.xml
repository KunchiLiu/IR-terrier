	<brief_summary>The freezing burden quantify subject Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) 6 week train . Two type intervention ( 20 subject group ) test : 1 ) Open-loop group ( OLG ) ; 2 ) Closed-loop group ( CLG ) . Each session OLG training include walk course aim provoke freeze episode . The experimenter trigger auditory rhythmic stimulation ( RAS ) walk condition likely invoke freezing ( e.g. , turn ) subject learn synchronize his/her gait auditory cue , i.e. , keep walk pace coordination , result , avoid freezing . Similar principle apply CLG training ; however , RAS elicit automatically device recognizes approach freeze episode .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The freezing burden quantify subject PD 6 week train . Two type intervention ( 20 subject group ) test : 1 ) Open-loop group ( OLG ) ; 2 ) Closed-loop group ( CLG ) . Each session OLG training include walk course aim provoke freeze episode . The experimenter trigger auditory rhythmic stimulation ( RAS ) walk condition likely invoke freezing ( e.g. , turn ) subject learn synchronize his/her gait auditory cue , i.e. , keep walk pace coordination , result , avoid freezing . Similar principle apply CLG training ; however , RAS elicit automatically device recognizes approach freeze episode . We anticipate intensive training , central nervous system ( CNS ) subject PD able anticipate impend freeze episode base awareness environmental condition ( e.g. , approach turn ) and/or base sub-conscious response deteriorate gait pattern . As result , automate motor response pace coordinate gait internally trigger CNS approach freeze episode avert . The overall freezing burden therefore decrease trained subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Have diagnosis PD . 2 . Suffer freeze gait ( FOG ) symptom . Subjects must score 2 item # 3 subjective FOG questionnaire ( FOGQ ) exhibit two FOG episode short , functional FOG evaluation procedure include FOGprovoking condition ( e.g. , turn , doorway ) 5 lap walk figure 8 shape trajectory . 3 . Able walk unassisted least 5 minute ample rest . 1 . Having serious comorbidities acute illness would make training inappropriate . 2 . Have brain surgery .</criteria>
