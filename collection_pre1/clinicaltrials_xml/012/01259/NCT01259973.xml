	<detailed_description>Objective : The preliminary result indicate pharmacological factor ( AP , dose drug availability depend cytochrome activity ) risk factor AP-induced EPS . In clinical trial , investigator study , healthy volunteer , effect pharmacokinetics , occupancy striatal dopaminergic receptor appearance EPS accord genetic polymorphism cytochrome gene CYP2D6 ( *3 , *4 , *5 , *6 Nxn ) CYP3A5 ( *3 ) . The investigator compare typical AP ( Haloperidol ) atypical AP ( Risperidone ) , metabolize CYP2D6 CYP3A5 . Specific objective : - Study relationship genetic polymorphism cytochrome gene CYP2D6 ( *3 , *4 , *5 , *6 Nxn ) CYP3A5 ( *3 ) plasmatic level Haloperidol Risperidone . - Study relationship genetic polymorphism cytochrome gene CYP2D6 ( *3 , *4 , *5 , *6 Nxn ) CYP3A5 ( *3 ) grade occupancy striatal dopaminergic receptor Haloperidol Risperidone . - Study relationship plasmatic level Haloperidol Risperidone grade occupancy striatal dopaminergic receptor two drug . - Study relationship genetic polymorphism cytochrome gene CYP2D6 ( *3 , *4 , *5 , *6 Nxn ) CYP3A5 ( *3 ) , plasmatic level Haloperidol Risperidone , grade occupancy striatal dopaminergic receptor two drug , appearance AP-induced EPS . Methodology : From cohort 200 healthy volunteer ( male female age 18-30 year ) , previously genotyped CYP2D6 CYP3A5 gene ( January June 2010 ) , investigator select subject depend metabolizer phenotype ( poor metabolizers , intermediate metabolizers , extensive metabolizers ultrarapid metabolizers ) DNA extraction whole blood sample SNP detection approach . Finally , investigator include follow four phenotypical group 6-8 subject group ( total N=32 subject , approximately ) : - poor metabolizers ( PM ) CYP2D6* - poor metabolizers ( PM ) CYP3A5** - extensive metabolizers ( EM ) CYP2D6/CYP3A - ultrarapid metabolizers ( UM ) CYP2D6* The design correspond three way cross-over randomize double-blind trial , wash-out period one week among treatment . Measurements occupancy striatal dopaminergic receptor do single photon emission compute tomography -SPECT- SEP measure base Simpson-Angus scale actimetry . General protocol : One week participation trial , volunteer undergo clinical physical exploration ( blood test , electrocardiography , urine drug screening ... ) train different test study ( minimize difference regard experience ) . During study , participant treat single dose AP drug ( 5mg Haloperidol 2.5mg Risperidone ) single dose placebo ( 2.5mL physiological serum ) . Plasma level measure +0.5h , +1h , +2h , +4h , +6h , +8h +12h drug/placebo administration . The tracer [ 123I ] IBZM administer +3h drug/placebo administration SPECT perform +5h . Status EPS , well positive negative AP-derived symptom , measure -1h different time frame post-drug/placebo administration , begin +3h +24h ( depend Scale use ) . Participants hospitalize three complete day ( separated one wash-out week treatment ) 8.00h 8.00h follow day Phase I Unit `` Hospital de Sant Pau de la Santa Creu '' , Barcelona , order monitor result obtain treatment . During hospitalization , participant give food drink every two hour . This clinical trial start February 2011 finish November 2011 .</detailed_description>
