	<mesh_term>Glioblastoma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm diagnosis glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , recurrent progressive disease follow primary treatment curable standard therapy . All patient must formalin fixed paraffin embed tissue available translational study . Presence bidimensionally measurable enhance lesion CT MRI , least one lesion minimum dimension 1 cm x 1 cm ( i.e . dimension must ≥ 1.0 cm ) . Baseline CT MRI must do within 14 day prior registration . ECOG performance 0 , 1 2 . Age ≥ 18 year age . Previous Therapy Chemotherapy : Patients may receive prior adjuvant chemotherapy and/or concurrent chemoradiation part primary therapy , must receive therapy recurrent/ progressive GBM ( i.e . PX866 must first treatment recurrence/ progression ) . A minimum 28 day since last dose chemotherapy must elapse prior registration . Targeted Therapy : No prior therapy phosphatidylinositol 3kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitor . Other targeted agent permissible provide give part front line treatment . A minimum 56 day ( 8 week ) must elapse since last day antiangiogenic therapy minimum 28 day target agent . Radiation : Patients may prior radiation therapy provide least 28 day elapse day last fraction radiation date registration . Previous Surgery : Previous surgery permit provide wound heal occur least 14 day elapse prior registration . 5.1.7 Laboratory Requirements ( must do within 7 day prior registration ) Hematology : Granulocytes ( AGC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L Chemistry : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x UNL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x UNL ALT AST ≤ 1.5 x UNL Glucose ≤ 8.9 mmol/L ( ≤ Grade 1 ) Women must post menopausal , surgically sterile use reliable form contraception study 30 day discontinue therapy . Women childbearing potential must pregnancy test take proven negative within 7 day prior registration must lactate . Patient consent must obtain accord local Institutional and/or University Human Experimentation Committee requirement . It responsibility local participate investigator obtain necessary local clearance , indicate write NCIC CTG Study Coordinator clearance obtain , trial commence centre . Because differ requirement , standard consent form trial provide sample form provide . A copy initial full board REB approval approve consent form must send central office . The patient must sign consent form prior registration ( exception translation ) . Please note consent form study must contain statement give permission NCIC CTG monitoring agency review patient record Patients give inform consent ( i.e . mentally incompetent patient , physically incapacitate comatose patient ) recruit study . Patients competent physically unable sign consent form may document sign nearest relative legal guardian . Each patient provide full explanation study consent request . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 2 hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , response assessment followup . In accordance NCIC CTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 2 work day patient registration . Patients active malignancy ( i.e . document imaging , clinical exam marker ) exclude . ( Please call NCIC CTG question interpretation criterion ) . Known HIVpositive patient . Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus . Patients stable dose steroid ( i.e . change dose 2 week prior registration ) enter study . Patients recently start steroid whose steroid dose increase recent past start protocol treatment least 2 week pass time steroid dose increment initiation . Under circumstance , baseline CT MRI scan purpose assessment response protocol treatment do time initiation protocol therapy ( i.e. , patient must reimaged control steroid effect ) . Note : The idea behind restrict entry subset patient rapidly change : especially rapidly deteriorate . If patient work trial appear need steroid introduce increase , patient treat medically appropriate ( i.e. , steroid introduce increase ) . Steroid NOT withhold clinically indicated patient register study ! Patients upper gastrointestinal condition would preclude compliance absorption oral medication eligible . Patients active uncontrolled infection , serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol . Patients eligible know hypersensitivity study drug component . Patients prior treatment PI3 kinase inhibitor .</criteria>
