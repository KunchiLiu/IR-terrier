	<brief_title>Fish Oil Versus Statins Versus Placebos Reducing Atrial Fibrillation Patients Undergoing Thoracic Surgery Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Atorvastatin design low cholesterol block production liver . This may help decrease chance heart attack stroke . Fish oil supplement design low fat level blood block production liver . This may help decrease chance heart attack stroke . Atorvastatin FDA-approved commercially available lower cholesterol fat level blood . Fish oil supplement also commercially available . Researchers want compare anti-inflammatory effect Atorvastatin fish oil supplement . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study `` Part '' base join study . Up 132 participant enrol Part 1 study . Up 120 participant enrol Part 2 study . If enrol Part 1 , randomly assign ( roll dice ) 1 3 group . You provide enough unmarked capsule fourteen day plus test dose . You take test dose clinic presence research nurse . Beginning 5 day lung surgery ( Day -5 ) , take 1 capsule morning , well 3 capsule 2 time day ( total 7 unmarked capsule day ) 5 day . The capsule take cup ( 8 ounce ) water may take without food . You remind research nurse bring remain capsule home prior admission surgery . - If Group 1 , capsule take fish oil supplement placebo . A placebo substance look like study drug active ingredient . - If Group 2 , capsule take atorvastatin placebo . - If Group 3 , capsule take placebo . You equal chance assign group . Neither study staff know receive study drug placebo . However , need safety , study staff able find receiving . After Part 1 complete , group compare learn group effective others . If neither fish oil supplement atorvastatin show effective placebo , study stop . If fish oil atorvastatin find effective placebo , study continue Part 2 . If enrol Part 2 , randomly assign 1 2 study group . You provide enough unmarked capsule fourteen day plus test dose . You take test dose clinic presence research nurse , begin take capsule 5 day surgery ( Day -5 ) 5 day . If atorvastatin find effective drug Part 1 , take 1 unmarked capsule morning day . If fish oil find effective drug Part 1 , take 3 capsule 2 time day ( total 6 unmarked capsule day ) . The capsule take cup ( 8 ounce ) water may take without food . You remind research nurse bring remain capsule home prior admission surgery . - If Group 1 , capsule take drug find effective Part 1 ( either fish oil supplement atorvastatin ) . - If Group 2 , capsule take placebo . You equal chance assign group . Neither study staff know receive study drug placebo . However , need safety , study staff able find receiving . Surgery : After take study drug/placebo 5 day , standard care lung surgery perform . You give separate consent form read sign surgery . On day surgery , unused capsule collect day , time , reason dos miss record . You continue take study drug/placebo 9 day surgery release hospital ( whichever come first ) . You follow dose schedule follow surgery . Study Visits : Each day hospital , vital sign measure check allergic reaction may study drug/placebo . On Days 1 3 , last day take study drug/placebo , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check liver function . About 4-6 week surgery , follow-up visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask symptom and/or side effect may . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check liver function . Length Study : You take study drug/placebo 5 day surgery , 9 day surgery ( total 14 day ) . Your participation study follow-up visit . You take study early intolerable side effect ( allergic reaction abnormal liver function test ) . This investigational study . Up 252 participant take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
