	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE The HIV TB epidemic disproportionately affect sub-Saharan Africa , catastrophic impact region . The synergy pathogen result dramatic increase TB incidence , 58 % case adult TB 2005 South Africa HIV-associated [ 1 ] . The impact HIV co-infection TB child yet well define due inadequate surveillance diagnostic challenge pediatric TB HIV resource poor setting . Studies demonstrate 10 60 % child TB sub-Saharan Africa co-infected HIV [ 2-5 ] . The risk diagnose TB among HIV-infected child show 8 time high among HIV-infected child among HIV-uninfected child [ 6 ] . The risk TB among HIV-infected child associate degree immunodeficiency , 3-year risk develop TB among immunocompromised child ( CD4 &lt; 15 % ) 12,400/100,000 , compare 3,300/100,000 less immunocompromised HIV-infected child [ 7 ] . TB HIV infect child cause morbidity , also frequent cause death among HIV-infected child [ 8 ] . Even though treatment HIV-associated TB complicate overlap toxicity , high pill burden occurrence immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) , experience concomitant TB HIV treatment child positive , HIV-infected child active TB start ART similar outcome child start ART non-TB diagnosis [ 9 ] . Co-administration TB HIV medication associate clinically significant highly complex drug-drug interaction . Protease inhibitor ( PIs ) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) substrates cytochrome P450 isozymes P-glycoprotein . Rifampin ( RIF ) , key component TB treatment regimen , potent inducer hepatic intestinal cytochrome P450 isozymes P-glycoprotein [ 10 ] . Multiple study demonstrate decreased concentration PIs NNRTIs coadministered rifampin [ 11 ] . The concentration Efavirenz ( EFV ) , nevirapine ( NVP ) LPV/RTV decrease much 22 , 68 75 % , respectively , coadministered RIF [ 12 , 13 ] . While interaction EFV may clinically important could overcome dose increase [ 12 ] , investigation LPV/RTV able provide full confidence high dos LPV/RTV overcome induction enzyme RIF [ 14 ] . In resource-poor country , adult HIV/TB co-infection receive combination EFV-based ART RIF-based TB treatment . In child 3 year age , EFV recommend antiretroviral treatment . The choice ART regimen TB/HIV co-infected child complicate limited option pediatric drug formulation and/or dose information . According World Health Organization guideline , first-line treatment recommendation child TB HIV co-infection triple NRTI regimen consist d4T AZT plus 3TC ABC [ 15 ] . Alternatively , standard first-line regimen two NRTIs plus NVP use . Both regimens suboptimal . The triple NRTI regimen show suboptimal virologic potency [ 16 ] , NVP-based regimen problematic child expose single dose NVP prevention PMTCT many develop resistance [ 17 ] . In South Africa , recommend regimen child age &lt; 3 year age receive concomitant treatment TB combination LPV/RTV NRTIs . A recent study demonstrate regimen also result suboptimal dos LPV/TRV give concomitantly RIF , even double dose LPV/RTV give concomitantly RIF provide adequate LPV exposures [ 18 ] . Another study assess super-boosted LPV alternative approach , use LPV/RTV extra RTV equal dose LPV study stop due safety concern [ 19 ] . Clearly , urgent need safe , effective feasible combine treatment young child HIV-associated TB . Rifabutin ( RBT ) , wide spectrum antibiotic particularly active acid-fast bacillus rifamycin limit CYP450 induction potential thus minimal effect concentration NNRTIs PIs include LPV/RTV [ 20 ] , recommend alternative treat TB combination PI-based ART adult [ 21 ] . In adult , RBT find equally safe effective RIF treatment TB , similar rate adverse event , cure relapse TB RIF RBT [ 22 ] . The information randomize clinical trial however dominate HIV negative individual The comparative randomize clinical trial HIV positive patient find RIF RBT safe effective demonstrate rapid clearance acid-fast bacillus use RBT [ 23 ] . The evidence observational cohort study include HIV-infected patient treat ART point inferior performance rifabutin , less rigorous . To date , publish efficacy study RBT combination boost PIs . In addition , clinical experience RBT TB resource-constrained setting limit , especially context PIs [ 24 ] . In March 2009 , Rifabutin ( RBT ) add WHO essential medicine list substitute RIF treatment TB HIV infect patient treat RTV boost PI-containing antiretroviral therapy [ 25 ] . Listing RBT essential medicine list , important first step toward increase availability RBT large scale use affordable cost resource-limited setting . The high cost RBT compare RIF however make inaccessible tuberculosis control program resource-limited setting . In August 2009 , Clinton Foundation announce price agreement Pfizer low price RBT emerge market 60 % , $ 1 per 150mg dose . This initiative greatly improve prospect use RBT public health approach co-treatment TB HIV develop country . The major remain stumble block use RBT concomitant treatment TB HIV child lack data ( dosing , safety efficacy ) use RBT treatment TB child . Until , dose RBT available treat Mycobacterium Avium Complex ( MAC ) child . Proper dose RBT combination LPV/TRV ART essential prevent failure therapy rise drug resistant TB HIV strain . The propose assessment optimal dosing strategy , pharmacokinetic profile , safety rifabutin give concomitantly LPV/RTV young child ( age &lt; 5 year ) critical step towards improve management TB/HIV child . Availability safe effective treatment regimen young HIV co-infected child TB highly important , especially light result Children HIV Early Antiretroviral Therapy ( CHER ) trial indicate HIV-infected infant treat ART early possible ( first month life ) dramatically decrease risk early death [ 26 ] . HYPOTHESIS AND STUDY OBJECTIVES Hypothesis We hypothesize clinically significant drug interaction exist rifabutin ( RBT ) lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/RTV ) young child ( age &lt; 5 year ) rifabutin dose concomitant administration RBT LPV/RTV need developed Primary Objective To assess dosing , pharmacokinetic profile , safety rifabutin give concomitantly LPV/RTV 14 day HIV-infected child age &lt; 5 year . STUDY PROCEDURES Rifabutin administration , formulation preparation Rifabutin ( RBT ) administer dose 5mg/kg three time per week period 14 day 10 child . All six RBT dosage take direct observation , witness subject 's home ( community base DOT ) . The amount drug dispense return also record pharmacy . A diary card provide parent guardian record dosage administration ( adherence ) drug throughout study . RBT compound Baragwanath hospital use 150mg Mycobutin capsule . Rifabutin suspension provide study 14 day supply . While currently commercially available RBT dosage form use child , rifabutin compound suspension easy use child find stable 12 week 4 40 °C [ 27 ] . Since anticipate minimal change LPV exposures addition RBT ( AUC ratio LPV+RBT/ LPV alone 1.17 , 90 % CI 1.04-1.31 ) [ 28 ] , LPV/RTV dose alter co-administration RBT . Initial Dose Justification There PK data child use RBT alone combination LPV/RTV . In addition , efficacy data use RBT treat TB child . Safety efficacy exist use RBT treat Mycobacterium Avium Complex ( MAC ) infection . The initial RBT dose 5 mg/kg three time weekly base review available pediatric adult data ( see detail ) corresponds recommend dose 150 mg/kg 3 time per week adult . Because direct benefit participate child , opt conservative , safe approach adjust target RBT concentration upwards , even dose recommendation adult increase future ( could happen base preliminary result present Boulanger et al ) [ 29 ] . Data Adults - In adult , recommend dose RBT give together LPV/RTV 150 mg 3 time per week , half dose half frequency compare administration RBT without LPV/RTV [ 21 , 28 ] . - Data adult demonstrate development acquire rifamycin resistance likely AUC 3.0 ( 1.9-4.5 ) [ mean ( 95 % CI ) ] compare AUC 5.2 ( 4.6-5.8 ) [ mean ( 95 % CI ) ] [ 30 ] . Data Children - The USPHS/IDSA guideline suggest RBT 5mg/kg QD child prevent MAC infection without concomitant protease inhibitor , use half dose combine rifabutin PIs . - Dose MAC treatment child 18.5 mg/kg ( age ≤1 year ) 8.6mg/kg ( age 2-10 year ) , maximum 300 mg [ 31 ] . - The minimal inhibitory concentration high Mycobacterium Avium Complex ( MAC ) , treat TB base MAC dose sufficient . - A RBT dose 5mg/kg three time week two week cause minimal toxicity child toxicity observe population use much high dos ( mean 9.2mg/kg ) much long duration ( mean 27 week ) ( Smith ) . - Safety efficacy data treat MAC child sparse . The risk corneal deposit increase prolonged administration RBT [ 32 ] , especially 14 month treatment , much long standard 6 month treatment TB . - `` There nonlinear relationship clearance size . The linear per kilogram model , base adult value , underestimate clearance , consequently , maintenance dose child . An establish scientific framework supportive allometric-based model weight coefficient 0.75 clearance 1 volume '' [ 33 ] . This correspond approximately twice clearance consequently twice per kilogram dose requirement child 2-years old ( range : 1-5 year ) [ 34 ] . Interim Analyses evaluate need dose adjustment An interim analysis PK data perform either completion study activity 10 child occurrence SAE determine related RBT , whichever occur first . A SAE define grade 3 4 laboratory abnormality , development uveitis , hospitalization death . Every SAE review committee consist three external reviewer : Dr. Mark Cotton Dr. Brian Eley , infectious disease pediatrician Cape Town , SA , Dr. Ed Caparelli , US base pharmacologist . If committee decides SAE unrelated RBT , enrollment continue 10 child enrol second SAE occurs . If SAE judge related RBT , interim analysis perform prior completion study activity 10 child . Children study drug start continue administration 6 dos , unless committee decide drug administration need halt . The NIH program officer ( Carol Worrell ) inform SAE decision make committee . Based interim analysis PK data , decision make dose dose interval subsequent child final sample size ( determine base variability observe first 10 child ) . The sample size aim sufficient precision dose reach geometic mean AUC ( 0-48 h ) child 5-6 mg.h/L , approximate AUC ( 0-48h ) rifabutin show effective adult [ 30 ] approximate RBN AUC use alone dose 300 mg/d adult [ 35 ] . PK Sampling safety assessment PK sample consist one intensive PK assessment steady state plasma concentration RBT , 25-o-desacetyl RBT ( desRBT , important active RBT metabolite ) LPV 14 day co-administration sample 0 , 2 , 4 , 9 hour LPV 0 , 2 , 4 , 9 , 24 48 hr RBT desRBT . To perform LPV , RBT , desRBT assay plasma concentration , total 1.5 ml whole blood collect . Safety assessment ( include clinical exam , liver function test ( ALT ) , full blood count ) perform screening , first schedule visit ( within 2 4 week last RBT administration ) , time child present sign symptom possible RBT associate toxicity . Concomitant Medications The following medication allow study : antiretrovirals LPV/RTV NRTIs , Rifampin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Carbamazepine , Fluconazole , Ketoconazole , Itraconazole , Steroids , inducer inhibitors cytochrome P450 PGP enzyme system . ( see appendix ) Any additional medication require study period approve member study team . LABORATORY EVALUATIONS Processing peripheral blood sample Whole blood sample 1.5 ml draw lithium heparin tube , centrifuge 4degrees C 2600rpm 10min ; plasma remove ; ship store -70 degree C future analysis laboratory Dr Maartens , University Cape Town . LPV concentration quantify validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) method use modification method Chi J et al [ 36 ] .The calibration curve linear range 0.05-20 mg/L . Any sample LPV result 20 mg/L dilute drug-free plasma reanalyzed . The low limit quantification ( LLOQ ) LPV assay 0.05 mg/L . Any sample LPV concentration LLOQ report &lt; 0.05 mg/L treat 0 mg/L analysis . LPV assay accuracy range 94.3 103.0 % . The intra-day inter-day precision range 0.14 4.72 % 1.61 4.22 % , respectively . Assays RBT active metabolite 25-o-desacetyl RBT develop LC-MS/MS , The validated concentration range RBT 25-o-desacetyl RBT 5-500 ng/mL ( =0.005 0.5 mg/L ) . Screening Safety Laboratory Assessments Laboratory assessment perform screen require toxicity reason study conduct NHLS laboratory . CLINICAL MANAGEMENT ISSUES Toxicity Subjects may experience toxicity side effect uveitis , arthritis , liver toxicity , neutropenia . All toxicity rare dose use study , reversible upon interruption RBT , describe child receive RBT several month . To maximally limit potential risk toxicity occur , : - carefully screen child pre-existing condition could increase risk toxicity ( see eligibility criterion ) - Perform careful clinical laboratory safety monitoring use DAIDS/IMPAACT grade system grade toxicity . - Have SAE ( death , hospitalization , grade 3 4 AE ) review independent safety committee ( see section 5.1.2 ) . Enrollment halt committee decides whether SAE relate RBT . CRITERIA FOR DISCONTINUATION - Premature Study Discontinuation Any child develop rash SAE ( grade 3 4 laboratory abnormality , development uveitis , hospitalization ) discontinue study . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Endpoints The primary endpoint study dose RBT resultant AUC 4.5-6.0 mcg/mL use combination LPV/RTV child age &lt; 3 year . Stratification If sample size patient characteristic allow , analysis stratify age nutritional status ( weight age z score ≤ &gt; minus 3 ) . Sample Size Accrual We estimate sample size 10 child provide information variability AUC parameter child , sufficient calculate final sample size time interim analysis . We estimate final sample size 30-40 allow sufficient number sample order perform PK modeling ( 210 data time point ) stratify analysis age nutritional status . Analyses LPV/RTV RBT concentration data analyze use standard WinNonLin Pro software determine PK parameter . Drug exposure assess use AUC0-24hr AUC0-48hr RBT desRBT , AUC0-12hr LPV . We also assess C0hr , Cmax , Tmax , oral clearance ( CL/F ) RBT , desRBT LPV . The AUC determine use trapezoidal rule . To analyze factor associate RBT serum level , perform analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) , rifabutin AUC0-24hr adjust drug dose dependent variable demographic , clinical , anthropometric , nutritional laboratory characteristic independent variable . In final analysis population pharmacokinetic model RBT desRBT generate use nonlinear mixed effect method . These model use simulate RBT dos require pharmacokinetic target , thus allow dose recommendation subpopulation , simulation change RBT exposure target . The data also use validate population RBT model build data source HUMAN SUBJECTS Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) Review , Recruitment Informed Consent The study review Institutional Review Board University North Carolina Chapel Hill , University Witwatersrand University Cape Town . Approval study need study activity start . The study also submit South African Medicine Control Council review approval . Potential subject identify routine clinic visit . The health care worker charge care child briefly explain study parent legal guardian child meet eligibility requirement . Caretakers interested refer study nurse inform consent process . The informed consent describe purpose study , procedure follow risk benefit participation . In event study subject 's guardian read , consent perform verbally subject 's native language . All informed consent procedure perform trained study personnel private exam room ensure privacy . A copy consent give subject . General Design Issues The study novel drug regimens child important pose several ethical challenge . The study team ( NIH reviewer ) assess several approach study RBT PK HIV infect child need concomitant ART TB treatment . Children could direct benefit receive RBT need TB treatment , i.e HIV-infected child diagnose active TB . Enrollment child RBT dose find study however raise possibility substandard treatment TB , risk defendable . To reduce risk exposure substandard TB treatment , one could perform real time therapeutic drug monitoring . Unfortunately , `` real time '' therapeutic drug monitoring still turn-around time least one week , still pose unacceptable risk substandard treatment TB child time period . Seen TB substantial risk death HIV infect child , risk unacceptable . Following several round discussion , group expert decide RBT PK study `` healthy child '' , i.e . child free TB . Because difficulty exclude active TB child ( obtain respiratory specimen young child difficult even successful , bacteriological yield low due paucibacillary nature TB child ) , decide optimal characteristic eligible child recently successfully complete TB treatment ( see section 4.1 ) . Realizing HIV infected child potentially vulnerable compare HIV uninfected child , one could suggest include HIV negative child recently complete TB treatment . The disadvantage approach one expose child two drug need ( direct benefit either drug ) compare one drug ( propose study , child receive LPV/RTV eligible ) . Furthermore , drug absorption metabolism HIV infect child may differ HIV uninfected child , phenomenon observe TB drug HIV infect vs. HIV negative adult [ 37-40 ] . For reason , select include HIV infection eligibility criterion . Subject Confidentiality Data collect study enter confidential database .
