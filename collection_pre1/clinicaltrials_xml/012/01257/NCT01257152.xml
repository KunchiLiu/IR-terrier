	<brief_title>Screening MRI Cancer Recurrence Patients Treated With Breast Conserving Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Patients treat breast conserve therapy follow recurrence ipsilateral contralateral breast physical examination every six month image study perform annually . - The image include mammography , physician-performed bilateral whole breast ultrasonography dynamic breast MRI gadolinium-containing contrast medium perform accord standard protocol . Interpretation conduct independently classify accord Breast Imaging Reporting Data System ( BI-RADS ) experience radiologist . - Definitive information presence malignancy obtain biopsy direct image method best depict lesion 14-g 11-g needle device needle localize excision . The absence breast cancer determine mean biopsy , absence positive finding repeat image clinical examination , follow-up . - After three round annual screening , diagnostic yield screen MRI compare physical examination , mammography ultrasonography assess .</detailed_description>
