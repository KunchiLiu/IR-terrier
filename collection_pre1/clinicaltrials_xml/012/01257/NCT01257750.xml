	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety efficacy drug [ Pazopanib ( Votrient ) ] treatment corneal neovascularization . The cornea clear , central portion eye neovascularization mean blood vessel growth . The cornea typically avascular , without blood vessel . Corneal neovascularization cornea put vision risk . Numerous disease cornea inflammation , ischemia ( restriction blood supply ) , infection , degeneration ( deterioration ) , trauma , corneal stem cell deficiency lead corneal neovascularization . This major ocular complication lead corneal scarring , edema ( swell ) , lipid deposit , inflammation may significantly alter vision . In addition , worsen outcome potential future treatment , corneal transplant . A corneal transplant treatment many patient severe corneal disease may ultimately need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Normally avascular , many pathologic condition , vessel may invade cornea limbal vascular plexus . Infection , inflammation , ischemia , degeneration , trauma , loss limbal stem cell barrier cause corneal neovascularization . Growth new vessel may result corneal scarring , edema , lipid deposition , inflammation may alter visual acuity lead cause monocular visual impairment blindness . Additionally , result loss immune response across cornea , thereby worsen prognosis subsequent penetrating keratoplasty ( PK ) . Growth new blood lymphatic vessel preexist vessel mediate member vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) family . In previous study , inhibition new blood lymphatic vessel achieve neutralization vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) . It also show platelet-derived growth factor-B ( PDGF-B ) play role corneal choroidal neovascularization regulate mural cell recruitment . Inhibition PDGF-B VEGF-A signal pathway show effectively promote vessel regression solely inhibit VEGF-A . Pazopanib drug design block pathway , stop new growth , regress old vessel growth .</detailed_description>
