	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study demonstrate FLUENCY® PLUS Endovascular Stent Graft effectively safely treat in-stent restenotic lesion venous outflow Arteriovenous ( AV ) access circuit hemodialysis patient either two predominant vascular access type - AV graft AV fistula .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FLUENCY® PLUS Endovascular Stent Graft In-stent Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study compare use FLUENCY® PLUS Endovascular Stent Graft ( follow Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty ( PTA ) ) PTA alone .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient must voluntarily sign date Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) prior collection study data performance study procedure . Patient must either male nonpregnant female ≥ 21 year age expect lifespan sufficient allow completion study procedure . Patient must willing comply protocol requirement , include followup procedure , contact telephone . Patient must AV access graft ( implanted ≥ 30 day ) mature fistula locate arm , must undergo least one successful dialysis session prior index procedure . Patient must previouslyplaced bare metal stent locate venous outflow AV access circuit ≥ 50 % stenosis originate . The entire target lesion must locate restenosed bare metal stent extend 3 cm outside bare metal stent . The target lesion must ≤ 10 cm length . After angiography , operator must judge lesion amenable angioplasty . The reference vessel diameter restenosed bare metal stent must 5.0 mm 12.0 mm . Additional stenotic lesion ( ≥ 50 % ) venous outflow &gt; 3cm edge target lesion must successfully treat ( define &lt; 30 % residual stenosis ) prior index procedure . The target lesion correspond thrombosis treat within 7 day prior index procedure . The target lesion reference vessel diameter large 12.0 mm . The patient infect AV access graft/fistula uncontrolled systemic infection . A pseudoaneurysm present within target lesion . The location target lesion would require FLUENCY® PLUS Endovascular Stent Graft deploy across elbow joint . The location target lesion would require FLUENCY® PLUS Endovascular Stent Graft deploy across segment graft fistula utilized dialysis needle puncture ( i.e. , `` cannulation zone '' ) . The location target lesion would require FLUENCY® PLUS Endovascular Stent Graft cross cephalic arch ( perpendicular portion cephalic vein region deltopectoral groove junction axillary vein ) . The location target lesion would require FLUENCY® PLUS Endovascular Stent Graft place Superior Vena Cava . The location target lesion would require FLUENCY® PLUS Endovascular Stent Graft place across angle great 90 degree . The restenosed bare metal stent fracture , verify angiography per institution 's standard care . The patient know uncontrolled blood coagulation disorder . The patient know allergy sensitivity contrast medium adequately premedicated . The patient know hypersensitivity nickeltitanium . The subject another medical condition , , opinion Investigator , may cause him/her noncompliant protocol , confound data interpretation , associate life expectancy insufficient allow completion study procedure followup . The patient currently participate investigational drug another device study complete study treatment clinically interfere study endpoint . Note : Studies require extend followup visit product investigational , since become commercially available , consider investigational study .</criteria>
