	<brief_summary>The goal study see type size particle find air pollution affect inflammation nose people skin test positive least one allergen . It observe pollution make allergy bad . It also suggest small particle may affect allergy large particle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Compare Effects Different Sized Particles Cells Nose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cough , bronchitis , asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associate elevated pollution particle level . Researchers believe particulate pollutant exacerbate allergy inflammation affect asthma allergy prevalence . In urban set Los Angeles Basin , particle generate vehicular traffic think important risk factor . Recently , Environmental Health Centre Southern California confirm strong association traffic near home school development asthma . This study help researcher describe effect various size pollution particle cause inflammation nose . There total 20 study visit . The study procedure include physical exam , symptom score nose , nose wash nose challenge particulate matter . The particulate give random order include follow : saline ( sterile salt water ) , inert carbon particle ( Carbon Black ) , diesel exhaust particle ( DEP ) , small ( fine ) particles small ( ultrafine ) particle . These last two ( fine ultrafine ) particle obtain concentrate normal Los Angeles air . The particulate spray nose standard nasal spray .</detailed_description>
