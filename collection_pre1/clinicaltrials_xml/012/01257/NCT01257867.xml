	<brief_summary>This study investigate effect daily use lithia water blood test neuronal oxidative stress , mood , well-being . Lithia water type pure spring water contain trace level lithium , naturally occur mineral . Neuronal oxidative stress cause normal chemical reaction human body sometimes result damage brain cell . Participation study last 8 week include daily use study water drinking . The primary objective pilot study test hypothesis , healthy male participant , daily use lithia water improve neurogenesis antioxidant capacity measure serum level brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) oxidative stress marker . Secondary objective include examine self-reported change mood , cognition , well-being .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There indication epidemiological study area trace concentration lithium drink water low rate suicide . This study evaluate effect drink EDJ ( pronounce `` edge '' ) lithia spring water ( come natural spring Rocky Mountains contain trace amount [ 0.68 mg/litre ] lithium ) 4 week , compare drinking commercially available bottled water ( contain lithium ) 4 week . This pilot study design 8-week randomized , counterbalance , crossover study 15 healthy male participant . Eligible participant use lithia water control water daily ingestion 4 week , cross condition another 4 week . At baseline 4-week condition , participant complete self-report questionnaire mood , cognition well-being , blood sample assay BDNF oxidative stress protein marker .</detailed_description>
