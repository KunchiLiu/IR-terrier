	<brief_title>Measuring Adherence Control Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite presence numerous effective medication , one-half adult receive treatment hypertension United States uncontrolled blood pressure . At least one-third hypertensive patient adherent blood pressure medication . Given high rate non-adherence , clinicians ideally consider whether patient take pill decide whether intensify blood pressure regimen . Yet , practice , clinician often unsure patient ' level adherence . This uncertainty limit clinician ' ability optimally manage hypertension . Electronic medication monitor represent gold-standard objectively measure day-to-day adherence . As result , potential best reduce uncertainty regard medication adherence . The goal study test whether provide clinician objective measure medication adherence obtain electronic monitoring improve clinician management uncontrolled hypertension . When data monitoring indicate poor adherence , may motivate clinician counsel patient adherence . Conversely , data monitoring indicate good adherence among patient uncontrolled hypertension , may motivate clinician intensify treatment rather presume patient non-adherent . To test hypothesis , study first enroll randomize 30 primary care clinician . Clinicians randomized intervention train use quantitative report summarize patient ' adherence blood pressure medication ; receive report visit patient later get enrol study . The study enroll 300 patient uncontrolled hypertension clinic . These patient adherence 4 blood pressure medication measure electronic pillbox . The MedSignals® pillbox ( LIFETECHniques Inc. , San Antonio , TX ) small ( 5 '' x3½ '' x1 '' ) , easily portable , simultaneous monitor adherence four medication . The device record pill take time individual pillbox lid open closed . Data adherence easily upload ( &lt; 1 minute ) connect pillbox telephone line . Patients return clinic 1 month take pill electronic pillbox visit research assistant clinician . At time , data pillbox download used generate adherence report . The report summarize percent day blood pressure medication take prescribed monitoring period provide guidance take action base data . After report generate ( &lt; 5 minute ) , patient attend visit clinician . Clinicians intervention group receive adherence report time visit whereas clinician control group treat patient accord usual care ( without report ) . Hypertension management 1-month clinic visit assess visit 1 ) review medical note determine clinician intensified hypertension treatment 2 ) surveying patient determine clinician counsel adherence . Hypertension management compare group .</detailed_description>
