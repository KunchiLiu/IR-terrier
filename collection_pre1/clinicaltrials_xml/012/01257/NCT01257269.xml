The underlie patho-mechanism severe congenital ADAMTS13 ( disintegrin metalloproteinase thrombospondin type 1 motif , 13 ) deficiency result compound heterozygous homozygous ADAMTS13 gene mutation . Although consider monogenic disorder clinical presentation Upshaw-Schulman syndrome patient vary considerably without apparent genotype-phenotype correlation . In 2006 initiated registry patient Upshaw-Schulman syndrome family member identify possible trigger acute bout TTP , document individual clinical course treatment requirement well possible side effect long stand plasma substitution , e.g . alloantibody formation viral infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Thrombocytopenia microangiopathic hemolytic anemia together severely deficient ADAMTS13 activity confirm diagnosis acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP ) . Today two form classical TTP distinguish . The acquired form cause circulate auto-antibodies , mainly Immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) , inhibit ADAMTS13 ( disintegrin metalloproteinase thrombospondin type 1 motif , 13 ) activity . In contrast , hereditary TTP , also know Upshaw-Schulman syndrome ( USS ) ; # 274150 Online Mendelian Inheritance Man ( OMIM ) , result severe constitutional deficiency ADAMTS13 due compound heterozygous homozygous mutation ADAMTS13 gene . The clinical course USS variable rather mild course patient require plasma infusion special situation ( i.e . pregnancy ) , others severe course important sequela even death early childhood occur . The reason variable clinical presentation treatment requirement elucidate . It seem likely , additional , hitherto unidentified factor besides severe ADAMTS13 deficiency modify clinical course . At present , clinical symptom laboratory value base treatment regimen hereditary TTP poorly understood . Furthermore , increase awareness hereditary TTP result rise number patient need treatment and/or prophylaxis . However , currently little known side effect long stand plasma substitution . Alloimmunization formation antibody act inhibitor treatment well know congenital coagulation factor deficiency ( e.g . hemophilia A ) , far case treat hereditary TTP subsequent antibody formation report . It aim hereditary TTP Registry provide information clinical course disease many patient possible therefore help establish recommendation necessity , modality , risk prophylactic plasma therapy patient hereditary TTP . Furthermore , help gain detailed insight trigger risk factor acute bout TTP . Moreover , hereditary TTP Registry provide information family member risk develop TTP-like TTP-related disorder . Objective Primary objective : Collection much information possible clinical presentation , disease course , disease-modifying factor , treatment modality patient suffer hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP ) . Secondary objective : To document potential adversary effect ( long-term ) plasma treatment patient hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP ) . Methods The TTP Registry design collect retrospective prospective clinical , molecular , observational data patient confirm suspected hereditary TTP . Additionally , Registry collect data family member TTP patient enrol Registry . The Registry enroll many confirm suspected hereditary TTP patient family member possible ; cap enrollment . The Registry enrollment follow-up period open-ended . The endpoint patient confirm suspected hereditary TTP family member death withdrawal consent .</detailed_description>
