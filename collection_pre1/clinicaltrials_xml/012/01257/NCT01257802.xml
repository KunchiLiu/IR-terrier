	<detailed_description>Patients woman age 18-40 either severe rheumatic disease require cyclophosphamide interstitial lung disease require cyclophosphamide administer either daily orally ; monthly intravenously ; intravenously every 2 week 6 dos . Because cyclophosphamide treatment may require urgently indication , study entry may occur either first second dose cyclophosphamide patient receive cyclophosphamide intravenously .</detailed_description>
