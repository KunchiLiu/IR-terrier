	<brief_summary>CSM ( Cervical spondylotic myelopathy ) common cause spinal cord injury worldwide . While evidence recently complete SpineNet prospective study surgical decompression effective treatment CSM , clear many patient remain neurological impairment . While surgery relatively safe , approximately 3 % patient maintain neurological problem . Given background data preclinical model non-traumatic traumatic spinal cord injury , strong evidence consider potential benefit add neuroprotective drug aid treatment patient CSM undergo surgical decompression . Riluzole FDA-approved treatment amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , similar clinical feature CSM . Riluzole currently investigation traumatic spinal cord injury . Given background , strong basis consider study potential neurological benefit Riluzole treatment surgical decompression patient CSM .</brief_summary>
