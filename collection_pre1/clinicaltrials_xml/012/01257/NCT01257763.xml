	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability experimental device introduces microscopic channel skin . Creating microscopic channel skin allow good absorption various medication apply skin , study determine study device offer tolerable method introduce hole . The study population include 54 individual , age 18-74 year old , roughly equal distribution skin color . Each subject total three visit 24 hour apart one another . The study device apply Baseline Day 1 visit . At various timepoints device application , skin assessment irritation complete use 7-point Skin Reaction Scale photograph take . Subjects report pain associate device application use standardized pain scale . At baseline visit , member research staff administer application study device side subject 's forehead , temple area side nose randomly select side face . The side face location receive application study device receive application `` dummy '' device . Subjects informed device study device `` dummy '' device . At Day 1 visit , member research staff administer study device application center subject 's forehead . The subject also self-apply study device chin , instruction research staff member . At Day 2 visit , final skin assessment make subject evaluate treated persistent skin irritation . Differences skin irritation site study device application `` dummy '' device application determine , well several endpoint .</brief_summary>
