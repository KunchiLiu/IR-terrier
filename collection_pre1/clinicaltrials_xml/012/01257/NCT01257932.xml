	<brief_summary>The investigator develop image protocol monitor predict breast cancer response neoadjuvant chemotherapy , prior early possible course treatment . The efficacy practicality conventional imaging approach neoadjuvant chemotherapy set varies identifies need alternate functional imaging strategy . Diffuse optical spectroscopic image experimental image method allow patient follow baseline treatment surgery cost-effective , bedside , handheld scan probe . The researcher evaluate harmonize diffuse optical spectroscopic image technology platform standardize neoadjuvant chemotherapy monitoring . Diffuse optical spectroscopic image academic research platform non-invasive . Studies perform five clinical site approximately 60 neoadjuvant chemotherapy patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator test effectiveness experimental image technology know Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging predict success chemotherapy treatment ( shrinkage tumor ) . Diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging measurement make laser breast scanner . This bedside-capable system combine frequency-domain photon migration steady-state tissue spectroscopy measure complete ( broadband ) near-infrared absorption reduce scatter spectra breast tissue vivo . Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging measurement make place hand-held probe tissue surface move probe discrete location along grid pattern 1.0 cm interval . The portable high-bandwidth Frequency-Domain Photon Migration instrument employ intensity-modulated diode laser conventional steady-state lamp source avalanche photodiode detector . The time require perform Frequency-Domain Photon Migration measurement depend desired precision number sweep .</detailed_description>
