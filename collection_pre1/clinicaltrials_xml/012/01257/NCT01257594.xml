	<brief_summary>The purpose study test effectiveness drug call erlotinib treat tumor . This multi-center pilot study explore efficacy molecular effect high dose weekly erlotinib recurrent EGFR vIII mutant malignant glioma , correlate molecular profile pre-treatment tissue outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EGFR Inhibition Using Weekly Erlotinib Recurrent Malignant Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amplification EGFR gene locus occur also approximately 40 % glioblastoma ( GBM ) . Activating EGFR mutation EGFRvIII occur approximately 50 % GBMs ( 20 % overall ) , lead constitutive receptor activation oncogenic signaling . The high frequency EGFR signal abnormality GBM lead initial enthusiasm clinical trial EGFR TKIs erlotinib gefitinib . However , response rare .</detailed_description>

EGFRvIII mutation detect pretreatment tissue least 1 prior surgery . At least 15 unstained slide least 1 tissue block must collect least one prior surgery . Recovered toxic effect prior therapy . Able undergo contrast enhance MRI scan ( CT scan patient unable tolerate MRI ) . Shown unequivocal evidence contrast enhance tumor progression MRI ( CT patient tolerate MRI ) comparison prior scan . Age &gt; = 18 year . Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; = 60 % . Life expectancy &gt; 8 week . Normal organ marrow function , adequate liver function adequate renal function start therapy . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test document within 7 day prior treatment . Women must agree breast feed . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Ability swallow tablet . Cohort A ( medical ) specific inclusion criterion : Fulfill general inclusion criterion . MRI/CT must demonstrate measurable enhance tumor least 1cm2 crosssectional area allow assessment radiographic response , unless : measurable disease present patient underwent gross total resection recent antitumor therapy . At least 3 month elapse prior brain radiotherapy initiation study therapy . MRI/CT must demonstrate measureable enhance tumor least 1cm 1cm square crosssectional area allow assessment radiographic response . Stable decrease dose corticosteroid minimum 5 day baseline MRI/CT . The baseline MRI/CT must perform 14th day less prior initiation study treatment . Cohort B ( surgical ) specific inclusion criterion : Fulfill general inclusion criterion . An MRI/CT scan show progression require . Received prior treatment convection enhance delivery , catheter base intratumoral treatment , carmustine ( BCNU ) /Gliadel wafer . Prior therapy include stereotactic radiosurgery therapy newly diagnose recurrent disease , reirradiation type , must confirmation true progressive disease rather radiation necrosis base upon surgical documentation recurrent/progressive disease .
