	<brief_summary>Background : - Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) common malignant tumor southern China Southeast Asia . Infection Epstein-Barr virus believe necessary development NPC ; non-viral environmental factor , dietary consumption nitrosamines , cigarette smoking , betel nut chewing , wood dust exposure possibly exposure formaldehyde , implicated disease . Genetic susceptibility may also play important role development NPC . However , information need connection genetic environmental factor NPC , particularly area cancer risk appear great . Objectives : - To examine main effect genetic factor environmental exposure ( e.g. , cigarette smoking , betel nut chewing , formaldehyde , wood dust ) nasopharyngeal carcinoma risk . Eligibility : - Cases : Individuals least 21 year age diagnose NPC one participating hospital resident northern Taiwan least 6 month . - Controls : Hospital patient diseases NPC least 21 year age , match NPC patient base hospital , age diagnosis , gender , ethnicity . Design : - This study involve risk factor interview , medical record abstraction biological sample collection . - Participants respond interview question lifestyle risk factor think involve NPC development . - All participant provide blood saliva sample study . Participants diagnose NPC also provide consent allow researcher study tissue sample take tumor biopsy surgery . - Treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) one common malignant tumor southern China Southeast Asia . While infection Epstein-Barr Virus ( EBV ) believe necessary development NPC , non-viral environmental factor also implicate carcinogenesis NPC include consumption salt fish nitrosamine contain preserve food , formaldehyde wood dust exposure , cigarette smoking , betel nut chew . In addition environmental factor , widely accept genetic susceptibility play important role pathogenesis NPC . Polymorphisms gene involve antigen presentation , nitrosamine metabolism DNA repair suggest associated NPC risk , various chromosomal region link NPC development report . Two recently complete NPC GWAS report strong evidence disease association observe SNPs locate 3.6 Mb Major Histocompatibility Complex ( MHC ) region chromosome 6p21 human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) gene locate . These association highlight role environmental exposure genomic variation etiology NPC . However , specific role EBV NPC pathogenesis completely understood study date difficulty pinpoint specific genetic factor involve NPC pathogenesis due complexity MHC region limit sample size candidate gene study . DCEG investigator Taiwan colleague longstanding history study elucidate role environmental genetic factor associate NPC . A case-control study ( 375 case ; 327 control ) conduct early 1990s follow large multiplex family study complete 2006 ( 358 family ; 3,216 individual ) . Results study provide substantial portion epidemiological evidence regard factor link NPC development date . At time , propose new case-control study Taiwan design 1 ) comprehensively evaluate environmental risk factor NPC ; 2 ) systematically evaluate genetic risk factor NPC previous GWAS candidate-gene study suggest association ; 3 ) explore gene-gene gene-environment interaction strong main effect identify study . In total , 2000 case 2000 control expect recruit five participating hospital Northern Taiwan . Cases consist 550 incident case ascertain retrospectively 1350 incident case ascertain prospectively . Controls hospital base ; frequency match ( 1:1 ) case age , gender ethnicity , exclude individual refer participate hospital due condition associate know NPC risk factor . This project collaborative effort investigator Taiwan NCI . Investigators Taiwan fund field recruitment data collection effort . Results study potential clarify currently controversial environmental risk factor well elucidate genetic factor NPC .</detailed_description>
