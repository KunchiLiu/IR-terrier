	<brief_summary>Dietary fiber likely role body weight management . They may increase satiety , consequence , reduce energy intake next meal . There , however , many different type dietary fiber , diverse physical property therefore impact outcomes differently . It , however , unclear whether dietary fiber different property lead difference energy intake next meal . The objective study study effect pectin 4 different physicochemical state ad libitum energy intake possible underlying mechanism ; i.e . gastrointestinal hormone , gastric empty rate , feeling satiety method fiber supplementation . We hypothesize viscous gel fiber reduce ad libitum energy intake compare low viscous low gel fiber .</brief_summary>
