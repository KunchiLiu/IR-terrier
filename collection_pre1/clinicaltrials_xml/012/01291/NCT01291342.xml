	<detailed_description>Preeclampsia form hypertension unique human pregnancy . The clinical finding preeclampsia manifest either maternal syndrome ( hypertension proteinuria without multisystem abnormality ) fetal syndrome ( fetal growth restriction , reduce amniotic fluid , abnormal oxygenation ) . The incidence preeclampsia range 2 7 percent healthy nulliparous woman . In woman , preeclampsia generally mild , onset near term intrapartum ( 75 percent case ) , condition conveys minimally increase risk adverse pregnancy outcome . In contrast , incidence severity preeclampsia substantially high woman multifetal gestation , chronic hypertension , previous preeclampsia , pregestational diabetes mellitus , preexist thrombophilias . The etiology preeclampsia unknown . Many theory suggest , withstand test time . Some theory : Abnormal trophoblast invasion , coagulation abnormality , vascular endothelial damage , cardiovascular maladaptation , immunologic phenomenon , genetic predisposition dietary deficiency excesses . Preeclampsia clinical syndrome embrace wide spectrum sign symptom clinically observe develop alone combination . The classic triad preeclampsia include : hypertension , proteinuria , edema . However , universal agreement edema consider part diagnosis preeclampsia . The diagnosis preeclampsia require presence elevate blood pressure ( BP ) proteinuria,3 usually start 20th week pregnancy , severity disease process generally base maternal BP consider traditional hallmark diagnosis disease . Women preeclampsia may exhibit symptom complex range minimal BP elevation derangement multiple organ system . The renal , hematologic , hepatic system likely involved . Renal function usually impair almost every case proteinuria always find . In preeclampsia , vasospasm glomerular capillary endothelial swelling ( glomerular endotheliosis ) lead average reduction GFR ( glomerular filtration rate ) 25 percent rate normal pregnancy . Serum creatinine rarely elevate preeclampsia , uric acid commonly increase . Despite fact uric acid level elevate woman preeclampsia , test sensitive specific diagnosis disease . The liver primarily involve preeclampsia , hepatic involvement observe 10 percent woman severe preeclampsia . Fibrin deposition find along wall hepatic sinusoid preeclamptic patient laboratory histologic evidence liver involvement . When liver dysfunction occur preeclampsia , mild elevation serum transaminase common . Bilirubin rarely increase preeclampsia , elevate , indirect fraction predominates . Elevated liver enzyme part HELLP syndrome , variant severe preeclampsia . Thrombocytopenia common hematologic abnormality woman preeclampsia . It correlate severity disease process presence absence placental abruption . A platelet count le 150,000/mm3 report 32 50 percent woman severe preeclampsia , And 15 percent case woman hypertension pregnancy . Review literature reveal 100 clinical , biophysical , biochemical test recommend predict identify patient risk future development disease . The result pool data various test lack agreement serial test suggest none clinical test sufficiently reliable use screen test clinical practice . As result obviously great need develop novel technology early detection pregnancy complication clinical manifestation appear . An early detection help early treatment prevent least minimize sequel disease . Volatile Biomarkers Preeclampsia : The intensity oxidative stress woman normal pregnancy , preeclampsia , nonpregnant woman , express volatile biomarkers exhale breath , study GC-Chromatography/Mass-Spectrometry ( GC-MS ) group Moretti Phillips . A 3-D display abundance C4-C20 alkane monomethylated alkane show mean volume curve significantly high preeclampsia patient normal pregnant woman ( P &lt; 003 ) nonpregnant control subject ( P &lt; 005 ) . A predictive model employ five volatile biomarkers ( undecane , 6-methyltridecane , 2-methylpentane , 5-methyltetradecane , 2-methylnonane ) distinguish preeclampsia uncomplicated pregnancy ( sensitivity=92.3 % , specificity=89.7 % ; cross-validated sensitivity=88.5 % , specificity=79.3 % ) . While promise , clinical value breath test predictor preeclampsia still unknown . This could attribute fact study focus oxidative stress relation preeclampsia time metabolic pathway ignore . A support latter come involvement many disorder ( e.g. , renal , hematologic , hepatic ) , find emit volatile biomarkers , preeclampsia . Putting preliminary study wider perspective , longitudinal study require determine increase breath biomarkers oxidative stress , , also , metabolic pathway earlier stage pregnancy predict onset preeclampsia . While part require knowledge could gain mean mass-spectrometry technique , use technique impede need expensive equipment , high level expertise require operate instrument , speed require sampling analysis , need preconcentration technique ( technique allow detect part ( 15-20 % ) volatile biomarkers find real exhaled breath ) . For preeclampsia 's volatile biomarker test become clinical reality , several advance knowledge specific preeclampsia volatile biomarkers sensor development need occur . Chemical sensor matrix , base nanomaterials , likely become clinical laboratory diagnostic tool , significantly small , easier-to-use , less expensive . An ideal chemical sensor volatile biomarker analysis sensitive low analyte concentration presence water vapour ( breath sample contain 80-90 % RH ) . Furthermore , respond rapidly differently small change concentration , provide consistent output specific give exposure . Objectives : The aim project early detection `` Preeclampsia '' pregnancy complication use volatile biomarkers appear exhale breath and/or blood sample , use simple inexpensive toll term NA-NOSE . Phase-I : The primary phase project comparison volatile biomarkers ' pattern pregnant woman suffer `` Preeclampsia '' , pregnant woman consider `` Normal Pregnancy '' , healthy `` Non-Pregnant '' woman . Phase-II : The secondary phase project ability predict `` Preeclampsia '' , compare , head-to-head , potential predictor use current clinical practice . Methodology : Study Design Outline : Phase-I study concentrate cross sectional breath test three group young woman agree participate sign informed consent form approve institutional Helsinki committee Nazareth Hospital . Groups : - Preeclampsia : 30 preeclamptic pregnant woman gestational age &gt; 24 week chronic medical disorder labor fetus alive . Preeclampsia define blood pressure &gt; 140/90 mm Hg 2 separate occasion least 4 hour one week apart proteinuria . Proteinuria define urinary dipstick value &gt; 1+ ( 30mg/dL ) , 24 hour urine collection protein excretion &gt; 300mg . - Uncomplicated pregnancy : 30 normotensive pregnant woman gestational age &gt; 24 week chronic medical disorder obstetrical problem , labor fetus alive . - Healthy control : 30 healthy non-pregnant control woman recruit mainly employee Nazareth Hospital healthy , medication deliver baby conceive year breath collection . Breath Test Sampling NA-NOSE well blood sample do Technion . Chemical analysis : The LNBD group ( Technion ) determine pronounce electrical feature organically functionalized nanosensor response volatile biomarkers ( breath blood sample ) , entire sensor array , use classical multi-linear regression model neural network model . Different linear nonlinear algorithm seek base principal component analysis chaotic parameter order reduce dimension data , extract important information . The exhaled air also analyze Gas-Chromatography/Mass-Spectrometry ( GC-MS ) conjugation thermal desorption determine nature composition volatile biomarkers relate breath blood sample .</detailed_description>
