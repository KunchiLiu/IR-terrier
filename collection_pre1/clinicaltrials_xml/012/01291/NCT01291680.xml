	<detailed_description>Chronic pain common . Up 10 % Population estimate suffer chronic pain 5 % female population estimate suffer widespread , chronic pain tenderness , thus fulfil American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) criterion classification fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) ( 1 ; 2 ) . FMS consider represent prototype chronic pain mediated central nervous system , i.e . condition chronic pain result augment pain processing ( diminish pain - inhibition ) within Central Nercous System ( CNS ) circuitry ( 3 ) . Clinical characteristic suggestive presence central , versus peripheral ( nociceptive ) neuropathic pain , lifetime history pain condition , diffuse , non- anatomical distribution pain , family history chronic pain co-existence additional `` functional '' symptom chronic fatigue , disturbed sleep , irritable bowel etc . The current paradigm accept pathogenesis central pain involve imbalance multiple neurotransmitter CNS , inhibitory ( e.g . serotonin , norepinephrine ) others facilitatory ( e.g . substance P ) govern process spinal pain transmission . Additional processing take place high center , amygdala thalamus ( 4 ) . FMS characterize presence allodynia hyperalgesia . In addition , medication show effective FMS similar condition different effective acute pain chronic pain condition characterize central ( e.g . malignancy - associate pain ) . Thus , opioids Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDS ) relatively ineffective treatment central pain ( former may even cause paradoxical hyperalgesia ) ( 5 ) medication increase level norepinephrine serotonin ( NSRIs ) often effective . FMS also characterize disturbance autonomic nervous system orthostatic intolerance , postural tachycardia etc . ( 6 ) The effect condition gestation post partum period well know . Parturition complex process involve multiple endocrine physiological change within short period time . Severe pain important attribute natural process . The process labor , delivery also peripartum period characterize acute shift volume , loss blood additional form physiological stress emotional distress . The purpose current study evaluate impact chronic central pain process parturition . Our hypothesis , woman demonstrate sign , symptom history central pain , onset active labor , differ woman demonstrate trait ; woman may require early high analgesia , may demonstrate increase hemodynamic lability labor delivery .</detailed_description>
