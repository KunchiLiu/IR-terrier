	<brief_summary>TGF-β cytokine find upregulated bone marrow patient myelofibrosis . This cytokine likely play dual role promote myelofibrosis myeloproliferation , bone marrow morphologic hallmark MF . The investigator propose inhibit TGF-β signal pathway MF decrease fibrogenic stimulus lead myelofibrosis concomitantly interrupt myeloproliferation . This novel approach treatment patient myelofibrosis .</brief_summary>
