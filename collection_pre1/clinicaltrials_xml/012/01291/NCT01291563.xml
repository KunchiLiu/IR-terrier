	<brief_title>TMC207TBC1003 - A Study Healthy Volunteers Investigating Effect Single-dose TMC207 QT/QTc Interval Under Fed Conditions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TMC207 investigate treatment M. Tuberculosis ( MTB , formerly know TBC ) infection . This study design establish effect single dose TMC207 QT/QTc interval healthy volunteer feed condition . This Phase I , double-blind ( study doctor participant know treatment receive ) , randomize ( study medication assign chance , like toss coin ) , placebo- active-controlled study evaluate effect single-dose TMC207 QT/QTc interval healthy volunteer . A single dose 400 mg moxifloxacin use positive control assess trial sensitivity . The trial population consist 88 healthy volunteer . Forty-four participant randomize Group 1 , 22 participant randomize Groups 2 3 . Each gender represent least 40 % . Each participant receive one Treatments A B one treatment session . Participants Group 1 take single 800-mg dose TMC207 Day 1 single dose moxifloxacin placebo Day 2 ( Treatment A ) . Participants Groups 2 3 take single dose TMC207 placebo Day 1 single 400-mg dose moxifloxacin Day 2 ( Treatment B ) . All intake TMC207 , moxifloxacin , TMC207 placebo moxifloxacin placebo take standardized meal . The duration study 3 day , screen follow-up period include . On Days -1 , 1 , 2 Treatment A B , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) record continuously 24 hour per day Holter monitoring . Safety assessment ( blood urine test , blood pressure , pulse , electrocardiogram , physical examination ) follow similar schedule perform treatment period , 4 week last study drug intake.The pharmacokinetic characteristic ( level-profile TMC207 moxifloxacin time blood stream ) evaluate multiple blood sample Day -1 tol Day 3 . Participants Group 1 take single 800-mg dose TMC207 Day 1 single dose moxifloxacin placebo Day 2 ( Treatment A ) . Participants Groups 2 3 take single dose TMC207 placebo Day 1 single 400-mg dose moxifloxacin Day 2 ( Treatment B ) .Â¿ The study duration 3 day without screen follow-up period include .</detailed_description>
