	<brief_summary>Background Some patient complain excessive evacuation , may become socially disable ( Azpiroz F &amp; Malagelada J-R , 2005 ) . However , systematic investigation range gas evacuation healthy subject subject complain flatulence basal condition response high-flatulogenic diet ( Azpiroz F &amp; Levitt DG , 2009 ) . Hypothesis Patients complain excessive passage gas per anus intestinal gas production anal gas evacuation basal condition response high flatulogenic diet healthy subject . This abnormality related difference colonic microflora . Objectives - To determine normal range intestinal gas evacuation basal condition response high flatulogenic diet . - In patient complain flatulence , determine whether intestinal gas evacuation basal condition response high flatulogenic diet increase . - To identify difference microbiota pattern subject normal excessive anal gas evacuation . - In patient complain flatulence , determine segmental distribution intestinal gas diet challenge . Methods Healthy subject ( n=20 ) patient complain flatulence ( n=30 ) undergo 3-day basal phase current diet 3-day challenge phase high-flatulogenic diet ; patient followed-up 7 day low-flatulogenic diet . The following g measurement perform : daily measurement number anal gas passage event marker , continuous record anal gas evacuation laboratory use electronic leakage-free gas collection system , colonic flora analysis fecal sampling , segmental gas distribution gut abdominal computer tomography ( CT ) imaging . Relevance These study allow develop normal range anal gas evacuation basal condition . Furthermore , provocative test develop diagnosis excessive gas production patient complain flatulence . This data allow proper diagnosis patient pave path rational management development evidence-based treatment strategy . This pilot study allow proper design adequate sample size calculation future interventional study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Some patient complain excessive evacuation , may become socially disable ( Azpiroz F &amp; Malagelada J-R , 2005 ) . However , physiology pathophysiology flatulence remain poorly understood ( Azpiroz F &amp; Levitt DG , 2009 ) . Gas evacuate anus originates by-and-large colon , unabsorbed meal residue ferment colonic bacteria ( Anderson et al. , 1981 ; Levitt et al. , 1987 ; Flourie et al. , 1988 ) . Indeed , show food component incompletely absorb small bowel enter colon ( Wolever &amp; Robb , 1992 ; Grimble , 1989 ; Steggerda FR , 1968 ; Wagner et al. , 1977 ; Steggerda F.R . &amp; Dimmick , 1966 ; Stone-Dorshow &amp; Levitt , 1987 ; Wursch et al. , 1989 ) intraluminal substrate interfere absorption nutrient ( Boibin M et al. , 1998 ; Hamberg et al. , 1989 ; Brugge &amp; Rosenfeld , 1987 ; Taylor et al. , 1986 ; Layer et al. , 1986 ) . Hence , volume gas production anal evacuation determine two main factor : diet , particularly amount fermentable residue , individual composition colonic microflora . Within subject , gas output varies relation diet ( Steggerda FR , 1968 ; Kirk , 1949 ) . However , great interindividual variability , gas evacuation subject maintain similar diet may differ substantially . It show healthy subject normal diet contain 200 g bean evacuate 705 mL gas per 24 hour , whereas fiber diet gas evacuation 214 mL ( Tomlin et al. , 1991 ) . In healthy subject frequency gas evacuation variable , usually around 10 evacuation per day ( Furne &amp; Levitt , 1996 ) . Based observation patient pass large amount flatus , classification foodstuff depend gas produce capacity elaborate ( Sutalf LO &amp; Levitt MD , 1979 ) . Few study specific foodstuff later add complement information ( Wolever &amp; Robb , 1992 ; Wagner et al. , 1977 ; Hickey C et al. , 1972 ) . However , systematic investigation range gas evacuation healthy subject subject complain flatulence basal condition response high-flatulogenic diet . Procedures Recruitment questionnaire A questionnaire use evaluate gas evacuation , bowel habit functional gut symptom . Daily measurement number anal gas evacuation symptoms The number gas evacuation per anus measure use event marker daytime . At end day follow parameter record questionnaire : discomfort relate flatulence evaluation abdominal discomfort/pain ( use 0-10 analogue scale ) ; number bowel movement form ( use Bristol scale ; ( Heaton &amp; O'Donnell , 1994 ) gastrointestinal well-being ( satisfaction/dissatisfaction use 10 point scale grade +5 -5 ) . Analysis colonic flora The composition intestinal flora evaluate measure flora composition stool . Subjects supply two Stool Collecting Kits ( contain two weigh sample tube contain RNA synthesis stabilization buffer ( RNA later , Ambion ) , one spare ) provide small sample stool ( least 30g ) . After mix stool buffer supply tube , subject store tube box home next visit hospital , centrifuge 12000rpm 5 minute , supernatant remove fecal pellet store - 80oC Gastroenterology Research Unit . Samples transport Danone Research , France analyse composition intestinal flora ( bacteria ) . Using molecular base method , concentration dominant sub-dominant bacterial group intestinal flora measure . These include bacteria belong Actinobacteria , Bacteroidetes , Firmicutes , Fusobacteria , Proteobacteria , Euryarcheota group . Continuous record anal gas evacuation Participants study laboratory . After standard breakfast , rectal gas collect via rectal cannula . Anal gas collect via leak proof , low resistance collection line , use barostat volume continuously record either 3 8 hour ( see study design ) . The composition gas collect analyzed . Once subject position bed , non-stretch belt , 48 mm wide , metric scale adjust around abdomen mean two elastic band . All girth change measure subject breathe relaxed , reference mid point respiratory displacement . A graded questionnaire use measure intensity type sensation perceive , anatomical questionnaire measure location extension perceive sensation . The graded questionnaire include five visual analogue scale grade 0 ( perception ) 6 ( pain ) , specifically score : ) sensation increase abdominal pressure , b ) sensation abdominal distension , c ) colicky/rumbling sensation , ) puncture/stinging sensation , ) type sensation ( specify participant questionnaire ) , respectively . The questionnaire include two additional scale score feel difficult evacuation gas per anus , belching , respectively , analyze separately . Subjects ask score perceive sensation ( one perceive simultaneously ) scale . The anatomical questionnaire incorporate diagram abdomen divide nine region correspond epigastrium , periumbilical area , hypogastrium , hypochondria , flank , ileal fossa . Subjects instruct mark location , i.e. , abdominal region ( ) extraabdominal , sensation perceive . Segmental gas distribution gut In patient complain bloating , abdominal CT scan take . This scan used rule organic disorder . Furthermore , use original program , abdominal morpho-volumetric analysis perform measure gas volumes different gut . All female participant childbearing potential undergo urine pregnancy test 24 hour prior scan . Hyperflatulogenic diet challenge For 3 day participant ask consume diet rich fermentable residue increase gas production rate . Low-flatulogenic diet At end study , patient put low residue diet 7 day ; give indication potentially expect response treatment . Working Plan Each subject attend follow visit ; first recruitment visit perform attend physician outpatient clinic , rest , include physiological measurement Digestive System Research Unit ; CT image perform Department Radiology . Visit 1 . Recruitment : entry questionnaire . Visit 2 . Before basal period : instruction , inform consent , delivery event marker , questionnaire , material fecal sampling . Visit 3 . Last day basal phase . Continuous record anal gas evacuation . Delivery dietary instruction ( high-flatulogenic diet ) questionnaires . In 8 patient segmental gas distribution also measure basal phase . Visit 4 . Last day challenge phase . Continuous record anal gas evacuation . CT evaluation segmental gas distribution gut . In patient : delivery dietary instruction ( low-flatulogenic diet ) questionnaires . Visit 5 . Last day correction phase . In patient : collection data material .</detailed_description>
