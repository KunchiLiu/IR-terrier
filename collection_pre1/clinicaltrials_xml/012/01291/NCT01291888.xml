	<brief_summary>The investigator postulate nebivolol effective equivalent dose comparative BB , specifically sustain release metoprolol succinate , improve availability NO , lower blood pressure , reduce albuminuria implication slow progression CKD cardiovascular protection high risk population . The objective proposal conduct randomize pilot clinical trial determine relative efficacy tolerability nebivolol versus sustain release metoprolol succinate improve blood pressure patient CKD albuminuria . The primary endpoint would decrease asymmetric dimethyl arginine ( ADMA ) . Secondary endpoint would include reduction blood pressure , urinary F2-isoprostanes albuminuria .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nebivolol Versus Sustained Release Metoprolol Succinate Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) increase risk mortality relate cardiovascular ( CV ) disease compare general population . Furthermore , reduce glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , define &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m² , show associate increase risk hospitalization , death cardiovascular event independent know cardiovascular risk factor . Albuminuria , marker endothelial dysfunction kidney damage , , frequently accompany reduction GFR development CKD , well-recognized risk factor kidney disease progression . Importantly , presence albuminuria also show powerful predictor CV mortality independent risk factor . Endothelial dysfunction implicate pathophysiology progressive renal disease may link CKD CV mortality . Levels asymmetric dimethyl arginine ( ADMA ) , competitive inhibitor nitric oxide synthase , elevate patient CKD . Elevated level ADMA show correlate presence endothelial dysfunction predict mortality patient CKD . In addition , ADMA show associated progression non-diabetic kidney disease lower ADMA level could potentially prevent progressive renal impairment . Oxidative stress also play fundamental role development endothelial function cardiovascular disease . While marker oxidative stress notoriously difficult measure , F2- isoprostanes consider reliable biomarkers vivo lipid peroxidation . F2-isoprostanes family prostaglandin F2 isomer produce free radical peroxidation arachidonic acid use end point clinical study anti-oxidant therapy . Blood pressure control important factor predict CV mortality . However , patient CKD , blood pressure frequently difficult control . Angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEIs ) , angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARBs ) without diuretic , antihypertensive agent choice patient CKD . More recently , combination ACEI dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker ( CCB ) show effective ACEI thiazide diuretic control blood pressure patient essential hypertension include CKD diabetes mellitus . However , even combination medication , blood pressure control patient CKD often difficult achieve . The effect beta adrenergic block agent ( BB ) lower blood pressure extensively investigated patient CKD . A randomize control trial hemodialysis patient Italy show high two-year survival receive carvedilol . Beta blocker routinely use low blood pressure patient CKD due possibility medication may deleterious effect insulin resistance , although theory disprove large clinical trial . A recent review point beta blocker underused patient CKD although offer many potential benefit patient population . This surprising , sympathetic overactivity important contributor cardiovascular disease propensity sudden death patient CKD . However , despite potential benefit BBs patient CKD use remain limited potential inducing relatively high rate adverse effect lack data regard effectiveness patient CKD . The recent availability third generation beta blocker nebivolol , know improve availability nitric oxide reduce ADMA level , thereby improve endothelial function , provide opportunity effectively control blood pressure , prevent progression CKD , also occurrence CV event . A reduction bioavailability nitric oxide ( NO ) show play significant role endothelial dysfunction hypertension . Therefore , increase availability nitric oxide potentially beneficial . In comparative study patient diabetes mellitus trial nebivolol versus metoprolol show metoprolol raise ADMA level , suggest worsen endothelial function , whereas nebivolol effect . Thus , nebivolol would appear major advantage BBs patient CKD due diabetes mellitus hypertension although yet systematically study .</detailed_description>
