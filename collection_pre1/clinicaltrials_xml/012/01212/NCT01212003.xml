	<brief_summary>Background : - Tuberculosis ( TB ) infectious disease affect numerous people worldwide . However , clinical study individual TB take place international site many few case TB United States elsewhere world . To provide good train infectious disease staff member National Institutes Health Clinical Center Washington , D.C. , researcher interest actively recruit individual TB research treatment study . Objectives : - To provide staff National Institutes Health Clinical Center increase experience hands-on treatment individual tuberculosis , include drug-sensitive drug-resistant form disease . - To collect blood sample study natural history tuberculosis . Eligibility : - Individuals 2 year age old either active latent tuberculosis . Design : - Latent TB patient : Participants single study visit physical examination medical history , provide blood sample test . - Active TB patient : Participants initial visit physical examination medical history , provide blood sample test . Participants also provide sputum sample require , may optional skin punch biopsy collect sample skin tissue study . - Treatment active TB provide part protocol . - Active TB participant return study visit every 2 month receive treatment , return every 6 month 1 year end treatment . Participants may ask return often researcher determine additional care need treat infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mycobacterium tuberculosis slow-growing bacterium establishes latent infection million person worldwide , lead disease 10 % less individual . It typically cause pneumonia , however dissemination almost organ possible . Drug resistance organism , co-infection HIV , paradoxical reaction upon treatment factor may complicate treatment . Host defense mycobacterial infection important . Specific defect within innate immune system lead Mendelian susceptibility mycobacterial infection . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infect individual person treat anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody highly susceptible tuberculosis infection . Genetic influence susceptibility TB disease complex seem confine single gene pathway . Advancement molecular technique expand understanding pathogenesis epidemiology M. tuberculosis . Identification gene mutation confer antibiotic resistance exploit alternative conventional drug susceptibility test . The natural history form TB disease ( include co-infection HIV infection ) follow , M. tuberculosis isolate blood 100 infected patient obtain order study organism virulence host immune function genetic/epigenetic factor . While recognize number tuberculosis case occur Washington , DC area nationally low , imperative mechanism place evaluate treat patient NIH Clinical Center . This protocol allow NIH infectious disease trainee manage challenge case tuberculosis .</detailed_description>
