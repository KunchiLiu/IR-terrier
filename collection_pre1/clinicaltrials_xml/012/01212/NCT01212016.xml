	<brief_summary>Background : - Food allergy characterize abnormal immune system responses certain food , peanut , strawberry , shellfish . Some individual allergy immediate allergic reaction contact food question need immediate treatment prevent severe complication . In contrast , eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorder related disorder white blood cell intestinal tract react certain food , cause abdominal pain , nausea , digestion problem . Researchers interested study condition well understand immune system respond food allergy . Objectives : - To examine immune system respond food allergen . - To examine certain white blood cell contribute disease individual food allergy inflammatory disease . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 65 year age history ( ) severe allergic reaction peanut ( peanut-specific antibody ) , ( b ) allergy inflammatory disease , ( c ) eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorder ( least two document food allergy ) . - Healthy volunteer 18 65 year age know allergy asthma . Design : - All participant screen visit procedure visit . The procedure visit take place within 30 60 day screen visit , take 3 4 hour depend procedure ( ) do . - Participants screen physical examination medical history , provide blood sample test . Participants peanut allergy additional test determine level sensitivity certain food . Participants eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorder provide stool sample test . - At procedure visit , participant peanut allergy participant allergy provide blood sample leukapherisis collect white blood cell examination . - At procedure visit , healthy volunteer participant eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorder provide blood sample leukapherisis collect white blood cell examination . In addition , participant procedure call esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) , examine esophagus , stomach , small intestine . Participants schedule EGD ask fast 6 hour procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Food allergy refers number disorder characterize clinical disease associate abnormal immune response food antigen . Classical IgE mediate anaphylactic food allergy characterize immediate hypersensitivity , prevalence approximately 6 % 3 % child adult , respectively . In contrast , eosinophil associate gastrointestinal disorder ( EGIDs ) , include eosinophilic esophagitis ( EoE ) eosinophilic gastroenteritis ( EG ) , food allergy associate disorder characterize eosinophilic inflammation gut , typically without anaphylaxis . Progress treatment management food allergy require understanding immunological pathogenesis disorder . A subset peripheral blood food allergen specific interleukin ( IL ) -5 produce T cell present EGID peanut allergic subject recently characterize . The primary objective study determine similar IL-5 produce T cell present gut EGID subject . To end , EGID healthy non-allergic subject enrol gastrointestinal biopsy obtain intracellular cytokine staining , RT-PCR ELISA . Additionally , protocol supply blood leukapheresis sample exploratory study immunologic mechanism underlie anaphylactic food allergy EGIDs . A total 400 subject recruit outside physician referral support group , well exist National Institutes Health ( NIH ) protocols enrolled Clinical Center study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects must meet inclusion criterion : All Subjects must : 1 . Be willing sample collect stored future research . 2 . Have document clinical history compatible EGID , peanut allergy , allergic inflammatory disease healthy without know allergic condition . In addition inclusion criterion subject , subject follow group must meet additional groupspecific inclusion criterion . Subjects EGID must : 1 . Be great equal 18 year age 2 . Maintain primary nonNIH physician routine care 3 . Have one type EGID : Eosinophilic gastroenteritis : Have clinical history eosinophilic gastroenteritis include gastrointestinal symptom , histological evidence stomach duodenal eosinophilia know etiology eosinophilia despite careful clinical evaluation . OR Eosinophilic esophagitis : Have diagnosis eosinophilic esophagitis , include evidence esophageal dysfunction peak count great equal 25 eosinophil per high powered field , biopsy obtain proton pump inhibitor treatment . OR Probable eosinophilic esophagitis : Have likely diagnosis eosinophilic esophagitis , base evidence esophageal dysfunction peak count great equal 15 eosinophil per high powered field , biopsy obtain proton pump inhibitor ( per section 6.3 ) . To confirm diagnosis EoE , subject may treat proton pump inhibitor therapy recommend dos gastroesophageal reflux disease least 84 week prior EGD biopsy . The decision recommend diagnostic biopsy accord concensus guideline [ 7 ] current standard care : base severity symptom , history food impaction , evidence remodeling ( stricture ) . Subjects Peanut Allergy : 1 . Be great equal 18 year age less equal 65 year age . 2 . Have history immediate hypersensitivity peanut involvement least one extracutaneous site , include wheezing , laryngeal edema , angioedema , vomit , diarrhea , hypotension circulatory collapse . 3 . Have peanut specific IgE great equal 5 kIU/L . Subjects Other Allergic Inflammatory Diseases : 1 . Be great equal 18 year age less equal 65 year age . 2 . These subject must diagnose allergic inflammatory disease , include anaphylaxis , asthma , hay fever . Diagnosis base establish criterion clinical entity . Healthy , NonAtopic Subjects : 1 . Be great equal 18 year age less equal 65 year age . 2 . Have history allergy , asthma food allergy 3 . Have negative ImmunoCAP fx5 vitro food allergy screen allergen specific IgE egg white , milk , cod , wheat , peanut , soy 4 . Have negative Phadiatop allergy screen EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects follow criterion exclude : 1 . Any condition , investigator opinion , place subject undue risk participate study Subjects Peanut Allergy follow exclude : 1 . Chronic upper GI symptom consistent EGID ( dysphagia , nausea , vomit , abdominal pain/cramps , early satiety ) PROCEDURAL INCLUSIONS : Subjects EoE EG undergo research EGD lymphapheresis must : 1 . Be great equal 18 year age less equal 65 year age . Subjects EG undergo EGD lymphapheresis must : 1 . Histological evidence stomach duodenal eosinophilia peak count great equal 40 eosinophil per high power field 2 . Greater two positive allergen skin test antigen specific IgE test follow panel ( peanut , wheat , soy , shrimp , egg white , milk , walnut , cod , corn ) Subjects either EG EoE undergoing lymphapheresis must : 1 .
