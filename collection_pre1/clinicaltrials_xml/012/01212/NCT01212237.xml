	<brief_summary>Normal tissue response critical brain radiotherapy , especially dose escalation carry increase incidence radiation-induced brain injury . Although radiation toxicity limit dose anatomically critical structure brain well study document , little know functionally critical brain region treatment cognitive sequela cranial radiotherapy limit . The objective clinical protocol accumulate preliminary data future study aim quantify dose response functionally critical brain region brain radiotherapy . We plan achieve objective correlate radiation-induced complication radiological change radiation dose select functionally critical brain region 25 patient . Each participate patient receive brain fMRI identify brain region process visual , work memory language function . The image co-registration algorithm develop previously group use co-register region CT scan radiotherapy treatment planning radiation dose calculation . Radiation-induced change cognitive function evaluate use modify mini mental status exam ( 3MS ) fMRI routine follow-up .

	<detailed_description>Research Question : Our goal answer follow three research question study : 1 . What dose response curve ( degree radiation complications/radiological change vs. radiation dose ) brain region involve process visual , language work memory function ? 2 . What limit dose functionally critical brain region apply radiotherapy treatment planning minimize ( e.g. , less 5 % ) possibility radiation-induced injury ? 3 . Can brain fMRI use guide radiotherapy treatment plan minimize dose functionally critical brain region evaluate treatment response region ? Research Method : Imaging radiotherapy : For patient , active stimulation rest fMRI examination perform addition standard anatomic MRI brain radiotherapy . Activation map region involve visual , language work memory function generate fMRI scan patient 's response work memory task ( i.e. , N-Back task ) record fMRI study . The MRI fMRI , combine , take approximately 90 minute - 60 minute standard MRI 30 minute fMRI . The activation map overlay onto FLAIR MRI image , import radiotherapy treatment plan system co-registered simulation CT scan . Radiotherapy routine follow-up : Functionally critical area fMRI activation map separately contour critical organ consider plan optimization . Dose volume histogram ( DVHs ) functionally critically brain region calculate documented . Each patient receive fractionate brain radiotherapy accord treatment plan follow every three month radiotherapy . Follow-up evaluation : The 3MS examination administer prior initiation treatment onset every three month treatment routine follow-up screen neuropsychological function . Anatomic MRI ( standard ) brain fMRI ( research ) acquire 6 month radiotherapy determine radiological functional change region involve process visual , language work memory function . Minimizing interference tumor recurrence progression : Two action take minimize interference tumor recurrence progression evaluation performance alteration cause radiation . First , patient inclusion restrict patient slow grow tumor , e.g. , meningioma , low grade glioma anaplastic astrocytoma chance tumor recurrence progression small . Secondly , patient develop disease progression post-radiotherapy follow-up exclude study , would possible distinguish effect disease progression radiotherapy side effect fMRI 3MS examination , finding would interpretable . Dose Response Analysis : Logistic regression analysis use assess likelihood complication functionally critical brain region function radiation dose . The dependent variable binary indicator identifies patient ' manifest complication ( decline 3MS examination score N-Back test , radiological/functional change identify MRI fMRI ) attribute radiation exposure . The logistic regression model include relevant subject level factor ( e.g. , age , gender , baseline Karnofsky performance status , tumor location , recent seizure , anti-epleptic medication ) covariates . The fitted logistic normal tissue complication probability ( NTCP ) model permit estimation probability significant complication associate radiation dose area , allow limit dose calculate dose expect induce complication acceptable probability ( e.g. , 5 % ) . Incorporation limit dose radiotherapy treatment planning : The limit dose `` Dose Response Analysis '' use IMRT re-planning consider functionally critical brain region . The optimization goal minimize dose functionally critical brain region maintain similar PTV ( plan target volume ) coverage keep dose critical structure within accepted tolerance . DVHs functionally critical brain region , PTV critical structure compare treatment plan without consider functionally critical brain region . A Wilcoxon match pair sign rank test perform compare plan term calculate NTCP critical organ . The McNemar test use compare plan without dose constraint functional area term yield rate ( i.e. , proportion patient IMRT plan successfully devise ) . The primary study endpoint study normal tissue complication . The primary objective study determine dose response curve limit dose functionally critically brain region brain radiotherapy . The second objective study investigate accuracy active stimulation rest state fMRI avoidance functionally critical brain region radiotherapy treatment planning brain tumor evaluate treatment response critical region .</detailed_description>
