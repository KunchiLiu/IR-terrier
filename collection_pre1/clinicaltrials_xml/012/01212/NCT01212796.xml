	<brief_summary>The allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell marrow curative treatment many hematologic malignancy . However , many patient relapse situation therapeutic possibility scarce mixed . Chemotherapy situation show good result new drug yet demonstrate effectiveness desire . Another therapeutic approach relapse post allogeneic transplant resubmit allogeneic transplant patient patient . In clinical situation little know . All previous study retrospective , data provide little statistical value heterogeneous patient sample . The GETH ( Grupo Espanol de trasplantes hematopoyeticos terapia celular ) include database figure around 350 second allogeneic transplant . Comparing study publish far , would large retrospective series publish size compare second allogeneic transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allo After Allo Stem Cell Transplantation Following Relapse After Allogeneic Transplant Haematological Malignancies : Retrospective Results GETH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It review 350 patient underwent allogeneic 2 begin monitor end 2009 , end follow-up . Is multicenter study row include possible patient take appropriate data . To center contribute patient study , ask fill basic information relate data sheet EBMT report ( MED-A MED-B ) . To collect form EBMT , patient previously authorize informed consent information collection . It include basic descriptive characteristic cohort comparison group conduct check sample homogeneous . The analysis divide descriptive data collection relate transplant , prior transplantation . It also collect data relate transplant do . FINDINGS AND PURPOSE The main variable analyze : overall survival , disease-free survival progression , relapse rate transplant-related mortality . Secondary endpoint analyze vary make data collection . Yet include : incidence graft-versus-host disease ( acute chronic ) , incidence infection . The purpose study description variable predict success failure make second allogeneic transplant first relapse . These variable also analyze third subsequent transplant . Also seek differentiate risk group among patient . The novelty study could provide regard previously publish study description third subsequent transplant , far reference literature date . FINANCING This study require funding . CONFLICT OF INTEREST There conflict interest DATA COLLECTION PERIOD AEMET submission acceptance : 1-2 month . Aceppt ( SEPT-10-2010 ) Data collection : 3 - 6 month Results : 6 - 9 month Publication presentation conference , 12 month</detailed_description>
