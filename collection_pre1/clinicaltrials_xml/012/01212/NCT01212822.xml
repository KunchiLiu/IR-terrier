	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial study well give bevacizumab combination chemotherapy together surgery work treat patient locally advanced esophageal stomach cancer . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bevacizumab combination chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving treatment surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Combination Chemotherapy Before Surgery Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Esophageal Stomach Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate two-year disease-free survival patient resectable esophageal gastroesophageal ( GE ) junction cancer treat perioperative bevacizumab leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin ( FOLFOX ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess , pathological examination surgical resection , complete partial response neoadjuvant therapy . II . To characterize overall progression free survival . III . To compare baseline post-chemotherapy/bevacizumab tissue biomarkers predict response resistance approach . IV . To investigate safety set . OUTLINE : NEOADJUVANT THERAPY : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 . Patients also receive FOLFOX chemotherapy comprise oxaliplatin IV 2 hour leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 , fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1-2 . Treatment bevacizumab repeat every 2 week 4 course treatment FOLFOX repeat every 2 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . SURGERY : Patients undergo plan surgical resection 4-6 week 6 course chemotherapy least 8 week since last dose bevacizumab . ADJUVANT THERAPY : Beginning 8-10 week surgery , patient receive bevacizumab IV , oxaliplatin IV , leucovorin calcium IV , fluorouracil IV neoadjuvant therapy . Treatment repeat every 2 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
