	<brief_summary>The American Heart Association ( AHA ) American College Sports Medicine ( ASCM ) recommend old adult ( 50≤ age ≤ 80 ) perform least 30 minute moderate-intensity aerobic exercise day ( ≥5 day ) week . This suggestion arise , part , data support regular physical activity reduces risk adverse cardiovascular event A portion benefit may reductions incidence severity cardiovascular risk factor , include diabetes mellitus , obesity , hypertension . While recommendation physical activity existence almost 15 year , rate obesity United States continue rise prevalence sedentarism remain best unchanged . Researchers engage investigate novel intervention design increase physical activity reach recommend activity target . One promise intervention involve use inexpensive , easy use pedometer allow individual objectively track number step take set period time . Recent data suggest average 10,000 steps/day measure pedometer accurately estimate activity level recommend AHA , ASCM , US government public health guideline . While benefit habitual exercise well-documented , data demonstrate current recommendation moderate physical activity old adult ASCM , AHA , US public health guideline reduce risk adverse cardiovascular event . Interestingly , prior work indicate pedometer-centered intervention increase physical activity , suggest type intervention could potentially lead cardiovascular benefit . Using validated surrogate marker cardiovascular risk include brachial artery endothelial function , tonometric measurement vascular stiffness , measurement derive transthoracic echocardiography , determine whether increase physical activity sedentary adult average 10,000 step more/day translate improvement cardiovascular health . This determine context randomize control trial employ control group , study group use pedometer alone , intervention couple pedometer internet-based motivational messaging software demonstrate preliminary data encourage old adult reach exceed 10,000 steps/day goal .</brief_summary>
