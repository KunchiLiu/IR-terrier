	<brief_summary>Background : - People epilepsy often auditory process disorder affect ability hear clearly may cause problem understand speech kind verbal communication . Researchers interested develop good way study part brain affect hear disorder epilepsy , need well clinical test measure individual process sound . These test allow researcher examine evaluate effect epilepsy related disorder speech communication . - A procedure call magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) use measure electrical current involve brain activity . Researchers interested learn whether MEG use detect difference process simple sound patient epilepsy , without hear impairment . Objectives : - To measure brain activity hearing impaired person epilepsy compare result people normal hear epilepsy well people normal hear epilepsy . This research perform collaboration Johns Hopkins Hospital epilepsy patient must candidate surgery Johns Hopkins . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 55 year age ( 1 ) epilepsy hear impairment , ( 2 ) epilepsy hear impairment , ( 3 ) healthy volunteer neither epilepsy hearing impairment . - Participants epilepsy must develop seizure 10 year age , must candidate grid implantation surgery Johns Hopkins Hospital.. Design : - This study require one visit approximately 4 6 hour . - Participants screen full physical examination medical history , along basic hear test . - Participants magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain , follow MEG scan record magnetic field change produce brain activity . - During MEG recording , participant ask listen various sound make simple response ( press button , move hand speak ) response sound heard earphone . The MEG procedure take 1 2 hour . - Treatment NIH provide part protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Auditory processing disorder common patient epilepsy adversely impact verbal communication . The neural base auditory disorder remain poorly understood , impede development objective clinical test . The overall goal project develop objective clinical measure auditory processing use computational modeling functional brain connectivity . To address goal , use novel functional connectivity method analyze magnetoencephalographic ( MEG ) intracranial electrocorticographic ( ECoG ) recording . Study Population : We acquire MEG data 48 patient intractable epilepsy prior undergo grid electrode placement neurosurgery evaluation Johns Hopkins Hospital . ECoG data acquire JHU ongoing study . Approximately half patient auditory process impairment . We also acquire MEG 20 healthy control subject auditory processing impairment . Design : Three plan study use within-subject , repeated measure design . The MEG study conduct patient subdural electrode implant intracranial mapping . The MEG study connectivity analyse perform NIH . The ECoG study take place Johns Hopkins Hospital . Data acquire use auditory stimuli task MEG ECoG part study . The functional connectivity analysis perform two data set . Outcome measure : The main outcome measure ( 1 ) functional connectivity pattern intracranial ECoG data differentiate epilepsy patient auditory impairment without auditory impairment ; ( 2 ) corresponding pattern MEG data . Secondary outcome measure consist relationship intracranial ECoG connectivity measure MEG connectivity measure .</detailed_description>
