	<brief_title>Preliminary Trial Effect Glucocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Borderline Personality Disorder ( BPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mifepristone antagonist type II glucocorticoid ( GR-II ) receptor , show safety , efficacy , good tolerability treatment psychotic major depression ( PMD ) . Like BPD , HPA axis hyper-responsiveness appear play role PMD pathophysiology . Belanoff et al . ( 2002 ) hypothesize mifepristone cause normalize `` reset '' HPA axis rhythm , account efficacy PMD . Mifepristone produce mark ( 2- 3- fold ) compensatory increase central cortisol level via antagonism GR-II receptor . This consequent central cortisol elevation may able counteract abnormally heighten CRH activity via enhanced negative feedback mechanism . This proof principle study mifepristone treatment individual BPD history childhood abuse , aim translate neurobiological research concern HPA axis abnormality BPD novel clinical intervention patient . This project also explore innovative approach structure pharmacotherapy BPD . Specifically , employ circumscribed ( finite ) drug administration period use prior study mifepristone neuropsychiatric illness , differs current clinical practice indefinite daily usage medication . We hypothesize mifepristone beneficially impact stress response neurobiology consequently ameliorate associate BPD symptom .</detailed_description>
