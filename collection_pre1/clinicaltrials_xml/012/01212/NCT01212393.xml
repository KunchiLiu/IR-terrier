	<brief_summary>The appropriate use thromboprophylaxis medical patient admit hospital substantially reduce overall burden disease due venous thromboembolism . However , use thromboprophylaxis medical setting appear generally poor leave at-risk patient unprotected . We aim analyse incidence symptomatic thromboembolic disease follow hospitalisation medical set efficacy multicomponent prevention approach emergency department include systematic evaluation thrombosis risk factor remembers thrombophylaxis indication modality acutely ill medical patient . Design : cluster randomize interventional study - Observational study patient level Setting : 30 French emergency department Patients : Patients 40 year old admit participate emergency department hospitalize acute medical reason . Main judgment criterion : rate symptomatic thromboembolic event severe haemorrhage formal 3-months follow-up hospital admission patient hospitalize least 48 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Method : At end observational period week , center randomize two group : intervention current practice . In intervention group , center provide poster pocket card , possible , computer decision support system remember venous thromboembolism prophylactic treatment . We propose change current practice group . Primary outcome : rate symptomatic venous thromboembolic event severe haemorrhage formal 3-months follow-up hospital admission patient hospitalize least 48 hour . All possible thromboembolic event , severe haemorrhage death analyse adjudication committee blind group assignation . Sudden death without obvious cause accord adjudication committee consider possible fatal pulmonary embolism . Sample size : We calculate sample size basis primary outcome . Assuming participation 30 center ( 15 group ) , intracluster correlation 0.01 , rate symptomatic thromboembolic event severe haemorrhage 5 % current practice group , need sample 16170 patient ( 8085 group ) detect 1.5 percentage absolute difference 2 group ( 3.5 % intervention group ) power 80 % significance level 5 % . Considering rate patient hospitalize less 48 hour around 5 % lose follow-up around 3 % , anticipate include 16500 patient main analysis 18000 patient overall study . Secondary outcome : - The appropriateness thromboprophylaxis overall population accord group assignation : - Number patient need prevention treatment accord international recommendation appropriate treatment . - Number patient without indication thromboprophylaxis receive treatment - The rate symptomatic venous thromboembolic event formal 3-months follow-up hospital admission - include patient - patient hospitalize least 48 hour . - inpatient hospitalize less 48 hour - The rate thromboembolic event - patient appropriate thromboprophylactic treatment - patient inappropriate thromboprophylactic treatment - patient thromboprophylactic treatment - The rate severe haemorrhage - patient appropriate thromboprophylactic treatment - patient inappropriate thromboprophylactic treatment - patient thromboprophylactic treatment</detailed_description>
