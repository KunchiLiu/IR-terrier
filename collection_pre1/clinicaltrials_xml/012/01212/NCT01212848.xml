	<brief_title>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) Suicidal Ideation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence suggest depression general , suicidal ideation particular , result dysfunctional regulatory pathway involve prefrontal cortical governance limbic activity . Repeated daily non-invasive stimulation prefrontal cortex TMS would theoretically strengthen reset cortical control pathway reduce suicidal ideation restore healthy circuit behavior . The aim current study ass efficacy TMS therapy treatment suicidal ideation patient depressive episode ( ) either PTSD mild TBI . It hypothesize participant receive repetitive TMS ( Group 1 ) relative sham treatment ( Group 2 ) three time daily three day evidence improvement suicidal ideation baseline end day 3 . Participants follow six month follow treatment assess safety long-term efficacy TMS .</detailed_description>
