Resequencing Pathogen Microarray ( RPM ) technology develop TessArae , LLC cease operation July 2014 ) use microarray chip identify multiple pathogen clinical specimen . The technology limit clinical application , early study show effectiveness accurately identify large number viral bacterial organism . In contrast conventional microbiological procedure base phenotypic trait ( growth characteristic enzymatic activity ) , microarray utilizes DNA sequence analysis detect identify specie , serotype/subtype , strain infectious agent . Aliquots respiratory specimen ( initially , specimen collect bronchoalveolar lavage , BAL ) 200 patient NIH Clinical Center Washington Hospital Center analyze use customized microarray chip . The specimen collect part patient routine clinical care . The result TessArray microarray analysis available clinician therefore effect clinical care patient .
