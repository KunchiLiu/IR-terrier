	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - estimate degree memory loss , follow radiotherapy base skull brain measure standard neurocognitive battery testing . - describe radiotherapy dose-related change vascular perfusion , spectroscopic parameter neuronal injury change degree directionality tissue water diffusivity ( diffusion tensor image ) measure white axonal injury . - relate imaging characteristic degree memory loss .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Skull Base Low Grade Glioma Neurocognitive Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data suggest region normal brain expose radiation dos otherwise regard safe limited current radiation treatment planning may contribute risk late neurocognitive injury . Radiation dose-dependent subclinical vascular effect report irradiated normal brain tissue hypothesize potential mechanism action . Direct neuronal injury another potential mechanism injury . 1 ) Estimate degree cognitive loss follow RT . 2 ) Demonstrate evidence radiation induce subclinical vascular neuronal injury adjacent brain region receive exit dos radiation . Subjects include patient malignancy skull skull base patient low grade glioma require radiotherapy . Baseline MRI image brain utilizing establish technique use identify characterize region interest anatomically adjacent region intend high dose irradiation . The MRI data ROIs register radiotherapy treatment planning CT order create single volume data voxel corresponds vector contain multi-parametric information . Subsequent repeat MRI image 1.5 , 4.5 , 12 24 month follow completion radiotherapy patient low grade glioma 1.5 12 month post radiotherapy patient malignancy involve skull base . Both cohort repeat standard neurocognitive evaluation 1.5 , 4.5,12 24 month follow completion radiotherapy . Analysis : Neurocognitive domain evaluate designated time point .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For Cohort 1 ( Patients tumor involve base skull ) Study subject capable provide informed consent . Study subject ECOG performance status 01 . Study subject age 18 great . Study subject histological diagnosis malignancy paranasal sinuses nasopharynx require either definitive postoperative radiation minimum prescribe dose 60 Gy . Study subject deem capable undergoing standard CT simulation radiotherapy treatment plan delivery include capacity comply standard immobilization device head nexk daily irradiation . Study subject without evidence distant metastasis . Study subject estimate life expectancy least 1 year . Study subject able receive standard MRI study deem capable comply immobilization need . Female study subject reproductive potential negative pregnancy test prior schedule MRI study . For Cohort 2 ( Patients Low Grade Gliomas ) Histological confirm diagnosis low grade glioma CNS WHO grade II Patients must Karnofsky Performance Status great equal 60 . Age great equal 18 . Patients must able provide inform consent . Adequate bone marrow function : WBC great equal 4000/mm3 , platelet great equal 100,000 mm3 . Women childbearing potential long agree use recognize method birth control ( e.g . oral contraceptive , IUD , condom , barrier method , etc. ) . Hysterectomy meopause must clinically document . Study subject deem capable undergoing standard CT simulation radiotherapy treatment plan delivery include capacity comply standard immobilization device brain daily irradiation . Both Cohorts Study subject questionable performance status treat physician suspicious life expectancy least 1 year possible . Study subject anxiety precludes safe administration MRI image time require . Study subject major psychiatric diagnosis prior neurooncologic diagnosis . For neuropsychological study , study subject neurological behavioral issue would preclude compliance study procedure . ( Karnofsky Performance Scale score less 60 , indicate patient need considerable assistance self care frequent medical care ) . Study subject inability undergo MR Imaging reason . Study subject history renal transplant know renal disorder calculate GFR &gt; 45mL/1min [ gadolinium restriction ] For neuropsychological study , study subject mixed language background one year educationin Englishspeaking school . Pregnant woman , woman plan become pregnant woman nurse . Additional Exclusion Criteria Cohort 2 ( Patients Low Grade Gliomas ) Prior simultaneous malignancy within past two year ( cutaneous squamos basal cell carcinoma , melanoma situ well differentiate thyroid carcinoma ) . Patients follow histology exclude : Gliomatosis cerebri , WHO III IV glioma .</criteria>
