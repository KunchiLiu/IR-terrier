	<brief_summary>Background : - Non-invasive functional near infrared ( fNIR ) image technique use infrared light detect change blood volume oxygen level brain activity . fNIR study possible way examine brain activity individual unable undergo standard brain function image technique ( functional magnetic resonance imaging , fMRI ) . For instance , war veteran iron shrapnel body able fMRI scan , young child child autism relate disorder often able willing cooperate long enough MRI environment allow full imaging study take place . Researchers interested compare result fNIR fMRI perform healthy volunteer determine fNIR produce similarly accurate result . Objectives : - To examine capability non-invasive functional near infrared image technique healthy volunteer compare result exist outcomes functional magnetic resonance imaging . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - Participants one study visit . Depending complexity task , whole exam take 5 minute 1 hour perform . - Participants ask sit still possible wear headband include light source detector ( fNIR device ) . - Participants ask perform set task ( e.g. , read sentence count number one head ) . Data collect experiment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : cross-validate near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) image system exist functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) data , b ) investigate significant technical issue associate optode placement motion artifact , explore technique potentially improve feasibility reliability system accord need population exist image system unsuitable . Study population : 100 healthy volunteer Design : The study look correlation NIRS signal change healthy subject perform functional task , exist fMRI data . Outcome Measures : grade change blood flow oxygen , measure NIRS , response different functional task . Note : This study sponsor Center Neuroscience Regenerative Medicine ( CNRM ) . De-identified data include image data send CNRM may share outside investigator collaborator . This data may use variety research purpose . The Henry M. Jackson Foundation Advancement Military Medicine ( HJF ) , USUHS , DoD representative may also access data audit purpose .</detailed_description>
