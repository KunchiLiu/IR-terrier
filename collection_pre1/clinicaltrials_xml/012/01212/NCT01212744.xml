	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability , Efficacy Study rAvPAL-PEG Administered Daily Subjects With Phenylketonuria ( PKU )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 16-week multi-center , open-label , Phase 2 study design evaluate safety , tolerability , efficacy daily SC injection rAvPAL-PEG subject PKU . Subjects naïve prior treatment rAvPAL-PEG met study eligibility criterion enrol approximately 8 site US Canada . Up 6 daily dose level rAvPAL-PEG plan may assess study ( 0.06 mg/kg/day , 0.1 mg/kg/day , 0.2 mg/kg/day ; 0.4 mg/kg/day , 0.6 mg/kg/day , 0.8 mg/kg/day ) . Enrollment begin 0.4 mg/kg/day dose level additional high low dos may add . The additional dose level choose assessment base safety ( systemic reaction clinically significant abnormal laboratory test result assess related study drug ) efficacy ( blood Phe reduction less equal 60 μmol/L ) information least 3 subject least 2 week daily dose rAvPAL-PEG . Initiation dose high low dose level per determination Sponsor 's Medical Officer consultation Investigator .</detailed_description>
