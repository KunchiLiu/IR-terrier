	<brief_summary>Objectives : Sleep characteristic use prediction neuro-developmental outcome . The aim study evaluate influence morphine midazolam development SWC newborns &gt; 32 week ' gestational age major non-cardiac surgery . Study design : This prospective aEEG study include infant &gt; 32+0 week ' gestation admit Neonatal Intensive Care Unit The Royal Children 's Hospital Melbourne undergo major non-cardiac surgery . The BrainZ Monitor ( BRM2 , Version 8.0 , BrainZ Instruments , New Zealand ) apply post-operatively . The time onset quality SWC maximum level morphine midazolam predictor time SWC assess . Results : Forty-seven eligible infant include . Emergence SWC observe mean 13 hour post-surgery . The maximum dose morphine midazolam predictive time SWC . Conclusions : Despite high dos continuous infusion morphine midazolam SWC observe aEEG neonate &gt; 32 week ' gestational age soon major non-cardiac surgery . The main type aEEG background pattern affect maximum dose either morphine midazolam . Abnormalities aEEG post-surgical patient always drug relate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There increase evidence neurodevelopmental impairment survivor non-cardiac surgery ( 1,2,3,4 ) . Psychosocial maldevelopment emotional problem report occur commonly child repair abdominal wall defect , routine assessment survivor non-cardiac surgery recommend throughout later childhood ( 5,6 ) . These report also emphasize need study child undergo major non-cardiac surgery neonatal period neurological substrate subsequent abnormal neurodevelopment well understood . Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography ( aEEG ) increasingly use monitor cerebral activity bedside neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) ( 7 ) . Widely used score system aEEG incorporate consideration background activity , presence sleep wake cycling ( SWC ) seizures ( 8 ) . There several aEEG report indicate analgesic sedative agent routinely use neonate suppress amplitude therefore alter background activity ( 9,10,11,12,13 ) believe interpretation aEEG sedate patient unreliable . Most study conduct investigate pre-term infant infant hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy . Sleep characteristic report predictor neurodevelopmental outcome ( 14,15,16 ) general agreement index stability SWC time positively correlate improved clinical outcome . SWC describe smooth sinusoidal variation , mostly minimum amplitude . Phases broader bandwidth represent discontinuous background activity quiet sleep , whilst phase narrower bandwidth correspond continuous activity wakefulness active sleep . SWC develop increase maturation child . From 31 32 week ' gestational age , quiet sleep period clearly discernable aEEG trace distinct period increase bandwidth . At term-equivalent age period represent trace alternant electroencephalography ( EEG ) pattern ( 17 ) . The average duration quiet sleep period 24 28 minute infant 32 36 week ' gestational age . These period slightly longer night otherwise relatively stable affected incubator cover developmental care intervention ( 18 ) . The internal trigger SWC locate brainstem presence SWC healthy term newborn consider sign brain stem integrity ( 19,20 ) . In newborns hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy sleep organization alter presence SWC aEEG consider good prognostic sign ( 21 ) . Timing onset SWC show predict neurodevelopmental outcome base whether SWC return 36 hour presume hypoxic insult ( 22 ) . There several report indicate analgesic sedative agent routinely use neonate may lead amplitude depression aEEG . However , knowledge currently report aEEG study SWC newborn infant require major non-cardiac surgery neonatal period . Studying background activity emergence SWC aEEG neonate require major non-cardiac surgery may provide useful information relationship analgesia sedation cerebral function post-operative infant . Knowledge effect drug may modify cerebral activity important interpretation aEEG 's critically ill neonate require high dos analgesics sedative . The aim prospective observational aEEG study describe influence analgesic sedative medication background pattern development SWC newborn infant bear &gt; 32 week ' gestation major non-cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
