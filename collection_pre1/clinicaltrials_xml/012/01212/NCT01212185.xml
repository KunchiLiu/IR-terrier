	<brief_summary>Purpose : Test whether intranasal administration neuropeptide , oxytocin , effective decrease alcohol withdrawal symptom , number bout withdrawal require standard medication treatment ( lorazepam ) amount lorazepam require control withdrawal bout individual undergo medical detoxification . Also , determine rate subject recruitment retention inpatient set . Participants : 80 alcohol dependent patient , 18-65 year age , admit medical detoxification . Procedures ( method ) : Subjects inpatient undergo medical detoxification alcohol . Oxytocin placebo administer nasal spray twice daily randomize , double blind manner three day . Withdrawal symptom measure routinely q4 hour prn length hospital stay . Lorazepam give whenever withdrawal symptom increase specific parameter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This double-blind , placebo control comparison efficacy twice daily intranasal administration oxytocin placebo ( saline ) reduce alcohol withdrawal symptom , number bout withdrawal symptom sufficient magnitude require prn lorazepam treatment ( see definition ) amount lorazepam require resolve withdrawal bout . Treatment group assignment random within sex . Subjects patient admit ( University North Carolina ( UNC ) Hospitals Dix Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) medical detoxification . Each treatment group compose 40 subject . Dr. Hamer , study statistician , construct randomization plan randomize 80 subject 2 group 40 subject blocksize 4 . This permuted blocksize blind study . Procedures : Most patient admit UNC Neuroscience Hospital Crisis Stabilization Unit , UNC Hospitals Family Practice Hospitalist Services , Dix CRU medical detoxification alcohol come UNC Hospitals Emergency Department Dorothea Dix Screening Admissions late even early morning . Physical examination , medical psychiatric history lab test ( include complete blood count [ CBC ] , magnesium , sodium , potassium , [ blood urea nitrogen ] BUN , creatinine , glucose , albumin , liver function test [ ALT , AST , LDH , GGT ] , throid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , B12 , folate , urinalysis , urine toxicology screen pregnancy test ) routinely obtain emergency department ( ED ) / Dorothea Dix Screening Admissions and/or inpatient unit admission process . Possibly UNC Hospitals ED/ Dorothea Dix Screening Admissions definitely admission unit , patient vital sign ( VSs ) measure withdrawal symptom quantify use revise Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Alcohol scale ( CIWA-Ar scale , Sullivan et al 1989 ) schedule standard alcohol detoxification order set UNC Hospital electronic medical record system ( CPOE ) system . The CRU Dorothea Dix use hard copy version CIWA use CPOE UNC Hospitals . After consent obtain , subject randomly assign treatment group ( oxytocin placebo ) . Prior receive first intranasal treatment , ECG obtain blood drawn obtain serum assay cytokine allopregnanolone concentration . Subjects also rate symptom use Alcohol Withdrawal Symptom Checklist ( AWSC , Pittman et al 2007 ) prior receive first test dose . These procedure done/overseen research nurse physician . Subjects usually receive first intranasal test dose 1000 1200 hour consist 6 insufflation Syntocinon Spray ( approximately 24 IU ) placebo , insufflation give 30 second apart alternate nostril . Test dose take 1700 hr later day ( Admission Day 1 ) 0900 1700 hr Admission Days 2 3 . Oxytocin test treatment administer 5 ml intranasal spray vial design deliver 0.1 ml meter volume per insufflation . The placebo treatment administer 60 ml intranasal spray vial ( contain 30ml solution ) also design deliver 0.1ml meter volume per insufflation . Vials contain oxytocin placebo spray blind label UNC Investigational Drug Service Dorothea Dix Hospital pharmacy . Research nurse physician oversee subject self-administration intranasal test dos . After enrollment admission day 1 morning admission day 2 3 , subject give multiple copy AWSC questionnaire request complete one time unit nurse CIWA rating . These questionnaire retrieve research staff follow morning . Shortly morning test dose admission day 2 3 , subject complete Alcohol Craving Visual Analog Scales ( ACVAS ) , Penn Alcohol Craving Scale , Profile Mood States ( McNair et al , 1971 ) . On admission day , research nurse also draw ( subsequently process ) blood serum sample assay cytokine allopregnanolone concentration shortly morning test dose . Additional blood drawn morning test dose admission day 2 obtain serum test run McLendon Laboratories ( magnesium , chloride , calcium , sodium , potassium , BUN , creatinine , liver function test ) . Another electrocardiogram ( ECG ) also obtain shortly morning test treatment admission day 2 . Research staff retrieve daily basis CIWA rating vital sign measurement obtain subject electronic medical record . In subject , PRN lorazepam dos administer mouth ( PO ) intravenously ( IV ) ( subject take medication PO ) whenever CIWA rating &gt; 14 per protocol standard alcohol detoxification order set UNC Hospital CPOE system . Lorazepam dose ( 1 - 4 mg ) frequency ( q 2 -6 h ) adjust base severity withdrawal symptom . This order set employ Dorothea Dix CRU .</detailed_description>
