	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial carbidopa treat disable attack nausea vomit patient familial dysautonomia ( FD , also know Riley Day syndrome hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type III ) . FD rare autosomal recessive disease growth development selective nerve impair . Patients FD suffer recurrent uncontrollable nausea vomit crisis accompany skin flushing , tachycardia arterial hypertension . Current treatment nausea ineffective intolerable side side . Our long-term goal treat nausea effectively without side effect , therapeutic intervention would markedly improve quality life patient FD . The investigator recently find rest plasma dopamine level high patient FD increase 40-fold nausea vomit attack . This lead u postulate stimulation dopamine receptor chemoreceptor trigger zone brainstem likely mechanism vomit . Carbidopa reversible competitive inhibitor aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase ( also know dopa-decarboxylase ) cross blood brain barrier . It use successfully many year block extracerebral synthesis dopamine avoid nausea vomit patient Parkinson 's disease take levodopa . The investigator reason carbidopa could similar antiemetic effect patient FD . The investigator propose conduct pilot trial ass safety , tolerability efficacy carbidopa treatment nausea patient FD . The pilot trial recruit 25 patient FD complain severe nausea affect quality life . The trial divide two consecutive , independent part . Part 1 , address safety tolerability carbidopa patient FD use open-label dose titration phase follow 4-weeks open-label treatment . Part 2 , address efficacy carbidopa treatment nausea patient FD use randomize , placebo control , double blind , 4-week cross design . The investigator hope demonstrate carbidopa safe , well-tolerated drug block peripheral formation dopamine thus prevent dopamine-induced nausea vomit attack patient FD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carbidopa Treatment Nausea Vomiting Familial Dysautonomia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients familial dysautonomia ( FD ) , also call Riley Day syndrome hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type III , suffer recurrent attack uncontrollable nausea vomit last several hour day severely disable . Hypertension , tachycardia skin blotch frequently accompany attack . Our long-term objective develop effective treatment nausea vomit patient FD . In preliminary study find plasma level dopamine high attack . Stimulation dopamine receptor chemoreceptor trigger zone brainstem well-known cause nausea vomit . The investigator postulate acute increase circulate dopamine level cause paroxysmal nausea vomit FD . Dopamine synthesized decarboxylation aminoacid L-dihydroxyphenylserine ( L-DOPA ) enzyme aromatic L-aminoacid decarboxylase , also know DOPA decarboxylase . Patients Parkinson 's disease suffer nausea vomit receive treatment L-DOPA . However , L-DOPA administer together carbidopa , reversible competitive inhibitor DOPA decarboxylase cross blood brain barrier , nausea vomiting prevent . The investigator hypothesize block conversion DOPA dopamine thus prevent increase plasma , treatment carbidopa decrease nausea vomit patient FD . Although carbidopa use many year patient Parkinson 's disease , never use patient FD . The first specific aim proposal ass safety tolerability carbidopa patient FD . The second specific aim proposal determine whether block peripheral synthesis dopamine carbidopa improve recurrent nausea patient FD .</detailed_description>
