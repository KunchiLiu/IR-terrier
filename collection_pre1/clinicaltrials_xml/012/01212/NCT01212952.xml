	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Pomalidomide bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Bortezomib may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , dexamethasone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving pomalidomide bortezomib together dexamethasone may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose bortezomib give together pomalidomide dexamethasone see well work treat patient relapsed refractory multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) bortezomib combination pomalidomide dexamethasone . II . To evaluate hematologic response rate ( PR , VGPR , CR ) pomalidomide , bortezomib dexamethasone patient relapse refractory myeloma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Time progression . II . To assess toxicity pomalidomide , bortezomib dexamethasone patient population . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study bortezomib follow phase II study . Patients receive oral pomalidomide day 1-21 ; bortezomib IV day 1 , 8,15 , 22 ; oral dexamethasone day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 8 course . Patients receive maintenance therapy comprise oral pomalidomide day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month .</detailed_description>
