	<brief_summary>When root canal infect teeth close end clean , disinfect fill , result predictable excellent outcome . However , tooth incomplete root development , end root ( ) must close fill root canal . One two-step artificial barrier use mineral trioxide aggregate ( MTA ) use fill root canal teeth . Despite high success treatment , procedure result complete root formation teeth susceptible root fracture . A number case report scientific journal show possibility regeneration nerve within root canal space continue root development teeth dead nerve open end . There little information regard use stem cell growth factor blood patient regenerate nerve teeth . Platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) whole blood mention literature potential ideal material regeneration nerve teeth . The purpose study investigate use PRP regenerate tooth nerve close root end teeth root canal infection open root end .</brief_summary>
