	<brief_summary>Background : - Secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis ( SP-MS ) chronic phase multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . The majority people relapsing-remitting MS eventually develop SP-MS . There currently effective treatment SP-MS . Researchers interested determine whether drug rituximab , use treat rheumatoid arthritis type cancer , able target certain white blood cell think play role progression SP-MS. To ensure rituximab reach brain spinal cord , participant receive intravenous drip intrathecal injection ( lumbar puncture cerebrospinal fluid ) . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness combine intravenous intrathecal rituximab individual secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 65 year age diagnose SP-MS form immunosuppressive therapy least 3 month . Design : - The study involve 1-year pretreatment baseline series visit , follow 2-year treatment period . Participants provide blood sample throughout treatment direct study researcher , additional study may perform study period participant consent investigation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Double Blind Combination Rituximab Intravenous Intrathecal Injection Versus Placebo Patients With Low-Inflammatory Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis ( RIVITaLISe )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The primary goal study define safety efficacy combine systemic intrathecal ( IT ) B cell-depleting therapy ( i.e . anti-CD20 , rituximab ) patient secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis ( SP-MS ) . The secondary goal study collect longitudinal data help identify sensitive outcome measure trial design future Phase II trial SP-MS patient investigate mechanism action rituximab human immune system . Study Population : Patients SP-MS mild moderate level clinical disability , medical contraindication IT intravenous ( IV ) administration rituximab . Design : This double blind , placebo-controlled , single center , baseline versus treatment , Phase I/II clinical trial IV IT rituximab SP-MS patient . Outcome Measures : Quantitative neuroimaging measure central nervous system ( CNS : i.e . brain spinal cord ) tissue destruction clinical functional ( i.e . electrophysiological ) measure neurological disability collect every 6-12 month . Additionally , biomarkers focus analysis cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) B cell immunological response EBV collect baseline treatment . The trial currently power use progression brain atrophy detect SIENA methodology primary outcome measure . However , may sensitive outcome available . In recognition , trial adaptive design : incorporates analysis progression CNS tissue destruction , measure quantitative MRI marker , clinical/paraclinical marker , define secondary outcome measure , first 30 enrol patient year long pre-treatment baseline prior randomization . All define outcome measure collect first 30 enrolled patient transform z-scores compare robustness longitudinal change coefficient variation . As result , primary outcome measure trial comparison individualize rate brain atrophy progression rituximab placebo group 2 year treatment ; unless predetermine analysis establish one secondary outcome measure higher z-score brain atrophy measurement . In case , primary outcome would efficacy rituximab versus placebo inhibit patient-specific slope functional structural deterioration measure sensitive biomarker CNS tissue destruction . Trial also include interim analysis efficacy B cell depletion intrathecal compartment pre-defined stopping criterion futility : le 50 % intrathecal B cell deplete active treatment ( measure &lt; 25 % decrease CSF CXCL13 &lt; 50 % increase CSF BAFF ) , trial deem underpowered demonstrate efficacy clinical MRI outcome would stop .</detailed_description>
