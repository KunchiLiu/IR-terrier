	<brief_summary>Cardiac surgery require use heart-lung machine , also know cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) induce abnormality blood coagulation ( clot ) lead excessive blood loss operation . While significant concern adult , problem take even great importance child due simple fact small blood volume . It well know child previously undergone heart operation , increase risk bleed cardiac surgery require ( `` reoperation '' ) . The process regulate blood coagulation extraordinarily complex , little know exact mechanisms contribute increase bleeding associate cardiac reoperation child . Rotational thromboelastometry ( ROTEM® ) technology provide , bedside , detailed information coagulation abnormality . While currently approve general use United States , Europe ROTEM® use guide administration blood product surgery base upon determination specific coagulation abnormality . Importantly , evidence guideline transfusion therapy base ROTEM® reduce transfusion requirement thus decrease patient exposure blood product . Whether use ROTEM® potential benefit pediatric cardiac surgical patient study . Accordingly , present study design provide preliminary data compare coagulation profile child undergo cardiac reoperation primary procedure . The investigator hypothesize ROTEM® analysis detect pattern impair coagulation child undergoing reoperation . The overall objective four assay ROTEM® analysis therefore , provide information use devise rational transfusion protocol pediatric cardiac surgical subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use ROTEM® Pediatric Cardiac Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific aim propose pilot study : 1 . Use bedside blood analysis ROTEM® pediatric cardiac surgical patient provide preliminary information nature coagulation abnormality . 2 . Compare ROTEM® coagulation profile subject primary surgery undergoing reoperation . In order test study hypothesis , pediatric subject schedule undergo cardiac surgery involve CPB recruit two study group : ) primary surgery ; b ) reoperation . For group , small amount blood obtain ROTEM® analysis induction anesthesia skin incision follow Cardiopulmonary Bypass , 5 minute protamine administration .</detailed_description>
