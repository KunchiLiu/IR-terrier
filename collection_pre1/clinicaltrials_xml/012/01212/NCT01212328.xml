	<brief_summary>Background : Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) currently lead cause death globally Asian Indians account 40-60 % global CVD burden within next 10-15 year . Risk factor control preventive care effective reduce CVD event mortality . The great gain CVD prevention see early target-driven intervention address multiple risk factor together . However , achieve control even individual risk factor ( blood glucose , blood pressure , blood lipid target ) poor , globally . Quality improvement scheme , like propose intervention , show promise high-income country , untested South Asia ; region population extraordinarily high CVD risk . Objective : To test whether clinic-based case management intervention ( consist guideline base treatment , care coordinator assistance decision support software ) reduce cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk among Type 2 diabetes patient South Asia , effective sustainable compare exist care . Trial subject method : The study involve total 1120 patient attend 8 establish out-patient clinic South Asia ( 140 patient clinic ) . Patients enrol trial randomly assign either control ( exist care ) intervention group follow average 30 month . The total trial duration 3.5 year , mid-August 2010 December 31 , 2013 .</brief_summary>
