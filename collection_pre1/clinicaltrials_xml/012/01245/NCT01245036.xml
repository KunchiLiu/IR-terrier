	<detailed_description>Sarcoidosis evolve position disease relative obscurity tropic , towards increase recognition report India around . From time sarcoidosis describe , always belief disease way related tuberculosis . However , inability identify mycobacteria histologic staining culture pathologic tissue continue one strong argument potential role mycobacteria . Of late , molecular analysis ( polymerase chain reaction [ PCR ] technique ) nucleic acid putative agent serve alternative method isolate fastidious organism . A recent meta-analysis suggest 30 % prevalence rate mycobacterial DNA sarcoid sample individual study report detection rate 0-50 % . Moreover , study publish country low prevalence tuberculosis . If indeed mycobacteria etiologically link sarcoidosis detection rate mycobacterial DNA sarcoid sample would high country high prevalence TB . In recent prospective case-control study aim detection mycobacterial DNA patient sarcoidosis India , reinforce hypothesis show mycobacterial DNA PCR 65 kDa protein gene 48 % sample ( BAL biopsy ) freshly diagnose patient sarcoidosis . There numerous factor favor mycobacteria trigger sarcoidosis . These include histopathological appearance granulomas 15 , report mycobacterial disease either exist coincidentally , succeed antedate sarcoidosis find mycobacteria occasional granulomas sarcoidosis.Passage experiment also suggest mycobacteria characteristic M. tuberculosis may incriminate agent.Recent study humoral immunity mycobacterial antigen sarcoidosis patient renew interest potential mycobacteria sarcoidosis . It show mycobacterial ESAT-6 katG recognize sarcoidosis CD4+ T cell present known sarcoidosis susceptibility allele , DRB1*1101 . It possible presence mycobacterial infection BCG vaccination genetically predispose host may involve development autoimmunity.It also suggest organism might exist cell wall deficient L-form may difficult isolate . This possible link implication differential diagnosis two common condition , may also therapeutic implication . Reactivation tuberculosis cortico-steroid treatment instituted sarcoidosis genuine concern , give high prevalence latent infection country . If indeed tuberculosis causal factor sarcoidosis , hypothesis reinforce , anti-tubercular therapy ( ATT ) useful treatment sarcoidosis . Very trials conduct past result trial discourage . These trial generally small study limited time bias use old regimen base isoniazid , amino-salicylic acid streptomycin . In experience nearly one third patient finally diagnose sarcoidosis , receive ATT variable length time , impact final outcome sarcoidosis study . The aim prospective randomize control trial ( RCT ) evaluate efficacy safety Rifampicin Isoniazid along prednisolone compare prednisolone alone treatment Sarcoidosis .</detailed_description>
