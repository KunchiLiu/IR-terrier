	<brief_title>Akt Inhibitor MK2206 Combination With Lapatinib Ditosylate Patients With Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumors Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) MK-2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK2206 ) combination lapatinib ( lapatinib ditosylate ) adult subject advance solid tumor . ( Dose Escalation Cohort ) II . To evaluate safety MK-2206 combination lapatinib administer patient locally advance unresectable metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive ( HER2+ ) breast cancer , previously treat trastuzumab . ( Dose Expansion Cohort ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical activity MK-2206 combination lapatinib administer subject advance solid tumor . ( Dose Escalation Cohort ) II . To describe dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) combine MK-2206 lapatinib . ( Dose Escalation Cohort ) III . To determine safety MK-2206 lapatinib administer combination . ( Dose Escalation Cohort ) IV . To determine pharmacokinetic pharmacogenomic profile MK-2206 combination lapatinib . ( Dose Escalation Cohort ) V. To assess target ( HER2-phosphoinositide 3-kinase [ PI3K ] -protein kinase B [ AKT ] pathway ) inhibition via peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) dose escalation cohort . ( Dose Escalation Cohort ) VI . To determine clinical activity MK-2206 lapatinib administer combination patient locally advance unresectable metastatic HER2+ breast cancer . ( Dose Expansion Cohort ) VII . To determine progression-free rate follow MK-2206 combination lapatinib administer MTD level subject HER2+ metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) . ( Dose Expansion Cohort ) VIII . To determine pharmacokinetic pharmacogenomic profile MK-2206 combination lapatinib . ( Dose Expansion Cohort ) IX . To assess mechanism lapatinib resistance evaluate tumor tissue phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) loss use immunohistochemistry . ( Dose Expansion Cohort ) X . To assess mechanism lapatinib resistance evaluate tumor tissue oncogenic mutation PI3K . Tumor response combination therapy lapatinib MK-2206 correlate presence/absence PI3K activate mutation PTEN loss . ( Dose Expansion Cohort ) XI . To assess mechanism lapatinib resistance assess target ( HER2-PI3K-AKT pathway ) inhibition via peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) . ( Dose Expansion Cohort ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) every day ( QOD ) 28 day ( 35 day course 1 ) lapatinib ditosylate PO daily ( QD ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 ( day 9-35 course 1 ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week patient expand cohort follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
