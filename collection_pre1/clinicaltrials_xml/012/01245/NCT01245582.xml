	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - To evaluate efficacy SECOX regimen add oxaliplatin plus capecitabine sorafenib versus sorafenib alone palliative treatment unresectable HCC patient prolong overall survival ( OS ) advance HCC patient . Secondary Objective : - To compare efficacy SECOX regimen Sorafenib alone progression free survival ( PFS ) - To compare efficacy SECOX regimen Sorafenib alone response rate ( RR ) - To assess overall safety profile SECOX regimen comparison Sorafenib alone</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin Capecitabine Top Sorafenib Versus Sorafenib Alone Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient , study consist baseline period screen 2 week , treatment period 2 week one study treatment cycle . Each patient randomly assign receive either SECOX ( Sorafenib , Oxaliplatin Capecitabine ) Sorafenib alone every 2 week disease progression , intolerable toxicity , patient 's refusal study treatment . There 30-day follow-up visit last study treatment . All patient follow-up every 2 month death observe post-treatment follow-up period .</detailed_description>
