	<brief_title>A Phase 0 Neoadjuvant Lapatinib Infiltrative Bladder Carcinoma Before Cystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients invasive bladder tumor , candidate radical cystectomy . Patients receive Lapatinib 3 week +/- 5 day , cystectomy . A comparison tissue original biopsy cystectomy Lapatinib allow occur . TREATMENT AND STRATEGY Lapatinib bladder carcinoma -Overall argument consider egf pathway involved bladder carcinoma far drug inhibit EGF pathway could impact therapeutical endpoint . Nevertheless unclear previous study add egf inhibit drug chemotherapy clinically relevant , essentially difficulty measure beneficial endpoint downstream EGF pathways modify drug , show lapatinib ( see 2.1.5 ) . Furthermore , argument initial selection patient base initial egfr and/or 2 tumor profile , ask intense knowledge . LAPATINIB TREATMENT Patients receive lapatinib therapy daily standard dose 1500 mg. LAPATINIB TREATMENT DURATION Patients receive 3 week lapatinib therapy + possible 5 day . As study non direct benefit study , exposition drug propose standard window 3 4 week organize radical cystectomy patient muscle invasive bladder carcinoma . In study patient , standard procedure delay purpose study . The duration exposition lapatinib long enough continuous impact biological event induce indeed inhibition EGF pathway also impact complex distal event apoptosis able measure . This justify 3 week treatment + possible 5 day due surgical organization procedure . Surgery take place last day treatment , recommend due half-life lapatinib . Nevertheless surgical purpose , drug could give day surgery .</detailed_description>
