	<brief_title>TPF Followed Cetuximab IMRT Plus Carbon Ion Boost Locally Advanced Head Neck Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TPF-C-HIT prospective , monocentric phase II trial efficacy , measure control survival rate , well toxicity ( acute late effect ) combine treatment TPF-induction follow radioimmunotherapy EGFR-antibody cetuximab carbon ion boost locally advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) . As long-term local control remain therapeutic challenge advance head neck cancer , locoregional control choose primary endpoint . Secondary endpoint survival rate ( disease-free survival , PFS , OS ) , acute late radiation effect well adverse event . For development prognostic marker , proteomic genomic analysis also include secondary endpoint .</detailed_description>
