	<brief_summary>This two-arm , open-label , randomized Phase III study compare single agent GSK1120212 chemotherapy ( either dacarbazine paclitaxel ) subject Stage IIIc Stage IV malignant cutaneous melanoma . All subject must BRAF mutation-positive tumour sample . Subjects receive one prior regimen chemotherapy advanced metastatic melanoma set enrol study . Subjects prior BRAF MEK inhibitor use exclude . Approximately 297 subject enrol 2:1 randomization ( 198 subject GSK1120212 arm 99 subject chemotherapy arm ) . The primary endpoint statistical analysis comparison progression free survival subject receive GSK1120212 compare chemotherapy . Subjects progression chemotherapy offer option receive GSK1120212 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>≥18 year age Stage III unresectable ( Stage IIIc ) metastatic ( Stage IV ) cutaneous melanoma also determine BRAF V600E/K mutationpositive central laboratory Received prior treatment one prior regimen chemotherapy advanced metastatic melanoma . Prior treatment immunotherapy ( exception prior ipilimumab , allow give adjuvant setting ) , cytokine therapy , biological vaccine regimen permit . Prior use sorafenib allow Measurable disease accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST 1.1 ) Women childbearing potential men reproductive potential must agree use effective contraception study . Additionally woman childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior randomization Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 01 Adequate screening organ function Any prior use BRAF inhibitor MEK inhibitor . Subjects receive dacarbazine paclitaxel prior randomization eligible receive chemotherapy study medication ( i.e . subject receive prior dacarbazine receive dacarbazine trial would thus receive paclitaxel randomize control arm ) History another malignancy . Exception : Subjects diseasefree 3 year , subject history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer successfully treat situ carcinoma eligible . Subjects second malignancy indolent definitively treat may enrol . Consult GSK Medical Monitor unsure whether second malignancy meet requirement specify Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) , Hepatitis B Virus ( HBV ) , Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) infection ( exception chronic clear HBV HCV infection allow ) Brain metastases follow exception ALL confirm GSK Medical Monitor : All know lesion must previously treat surgery stereotactic radiosurgery , Brain lesion ( ) , still present , must confirm stable ( i.e . increase lesion size ) ≥90 day prior randomization ( must document two consecutive MRI CT scan use contrast ) , asymptomatic corticosteroid requirement ≥ 30 day prior randomization , enzymeinducing anticonvulsant ≥ 30 day prior randomization History evidence cardiovascular risk include follow : QTcB ≥ 480 msec . History evidence current clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmia . Exception : Subjects control atrial fibrillation &gt; 30 day prior randomization eligible History acute coronary syndrome ( include myocardial infarction unstable angina ) , coronary angioplasty , stenting within 6 month prior randomization . History evidence current ≥ Class II congestive heart failure define New York Heart Association History interstitial lung disease pneumonitis History current evidence / risk retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) central serous retinopathy ( CSR ) : History RVO CSR , predispose factor RVO CSR ( e.g . uncontrolled glaucoma ocular hypertension , uncontrolled hypertension , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , history hyperviscosity hypercoagulability syndrome ) .
