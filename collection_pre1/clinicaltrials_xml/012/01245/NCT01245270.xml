	<brief_summary>Dietary strategy alleviate health complication associate type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) pursue alternative pharmaceutical intervention . Berries bilberries rich polyphenols may influence carbohydrate digestion absorption thus postprandial glycaemia . In addition berry report alter incretins well anti-oxidant anti-inflammatory property may also affect postprandial glycaemia . This study investigate acute affect standardise bilberry extract glucose metabolism T2D . Eight male volunteer T2D control diabetes diet lifestyle alone give single oral capsule either 0.47g standardized bilberry extract ( 36 % ( w/w ) anthocyanins ) equate ∼50 g fresh bilberry placebo follow polysaccharide drink ( equivalent 75 g glucose ) double blind cross intervention two week washout period . This study demonstrate ingestion concentrate bilberry extract reduces postprandial glycaemia insulin volunteer T2D . The likely mechanism lower glycaemic response involve reduce rate carbohydrate digestion and/or absorption .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single Supplement Standardised Bilberry Extract Modifies Glycaemic Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dietary strategy alleviate health complication , premature vascular disease , associate type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) obesity actively pursue alternative pharmaceutical intervention . The genus Vaccinium ( e.g . blueberry , bilberry , cranberry ) use traditionally source folk remedy establish diabetic symptom . Berries genus enriched anthocyanins , polyphenols recognize ability provide activate cellular antioxidant protection inhibit inflammatory gene expression , activity may contribute efficacy Vaccinium genus ameliorators type 2 diabetes . Consumption freeze-dried blueberry beverage 8 week period example decrease plasma concentration cardiovascular risk factor oxidize LDL , malondialdehyde hydroxynonenal . In another trial , bioactives blueberry improve insulin sensitivity obese insulin-resistant men woman . In study investigator report change inflammatory marker follow supplementation although bilberry juice show modulate plasma marker inflammation C-reactive protein IL-6 subject increase risk cardiovascular disease . These beneficial response human study support data demonstrate long-term beneficial effect anthocyanins mouse model obesity diabetes . There also number study vitro vivo suggest polyphenols influence carbohydrate digestion absorption , result improve postprandial glycaemia short term . Polyphenols inhibit intestinal alpha glucosidase activity glucose transport vitro . In association , polyphenols administer rodent suppress elevation blood glucose concentration oral administration mono- di-saccharides . In human , several study examine effect polyphenols post-prandial glycaemic response . In one study test meal mixed berry purée sucrose show low plasma glucose concentration 15-30 min compare control match sugar . Overall , evidence suggest consume edible berry , particularly genus Vaccinium , high concentration anthocyanins could provide supplementary intervention improve glycaemia subject T2D impair glucose tolerance . The object study investigate whether single supplementation standardise ( 36 % w/w anthocyanins ) concentrate bilberry extract could alter glucose metabolism overweight/obese volunteer impair glucose intolerance T2D compare control capsule match sugar explore possible mechanisms action .</detailed_description>
