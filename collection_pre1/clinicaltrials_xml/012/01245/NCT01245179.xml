	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find safety effect drug call panobinostat give adult sickle cell disease . Panobinostat pan histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor . HDAC inhibitor show significantly increase hemoglobin F induction , well document improve outcome sickle cell disease . HDAC inhibitor also know potently inhibit cell-specific inflammation , primary contributor debilitate effect sickle cell disease . Given relevance mechanism action SCD , panobinostat may prove contribute significantly management SCD patient , population critical need effective treatment option .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Panobinostat ( LBH589 ) Patients With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This one-arm , open-label , multi-center , Phase I , dose-escalation study Panobinostat administer via different dose schedule . In schedule , study design determine MTD ( maximum tolerate dose ) DLT ( dose limit toxicity ) panobinostat single agent , characterize safety tolerability panobinostat adult patient sickle cell disease fail respond hydroxyurea therapy ( clinically hematologically ) intolerant refuse hydroxyurea therapy . The study consist Screening Phase , Treatment Phase , Post-Treatment Follow-up.Screening Subjects screen eligibility within 28 day baseline visit ( Day 1 ) . Screening assessment include informed consent , physical exam , vital sign ( height , weight , blood pressure , heart rate , height , weight , respiration ) , review medical history , review concomitant medication , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , echocardiogram , laboratory assessment . Screening laboratory assessment include follow : CBC differential , reticulocyte , complete chemistry panel , LDH , serum ferritin , thyroid function testing , Hb F percentage , F-cells , HIV , urinalysis ( microscopic evaluation indicate ) , serum pregnancy female childbearing potential . Approximately 15 ml ( 1 tablespoon ) blood collect screen visit . Treatment The treatment phase twelve week duration . Each subject assign specify dose level dose schedule remain assigned regimen , tolerate , throughout twelve week period . Regardless specific dose assignment , subject take study drug thrice weekly ( Monday , Wednesday , Friday ) . The first three patient enroll study assign dose level 1 ( 10 mg ) , dose schedule one week treatment ( Monday , Wednesday , Friday ) follow three week treatment entire 12 week treatment period . The next three subject assign dose level 1 ( 10 mg ) , two week treatment ( Monday , Wednesday , Friday ) follow two week treatment entire 12 week treatment period . The following three subject assign dose level 1 ( 10 mg ) , continuous thrice weekly dose entire 12 week treatment period . Patient assignment continue manner three dose level schedule fill maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) find . All three subject give cohort must complete one cycle treatment enrollment begin next cohort . If MTD identify cohort complete , subsequent subject enrol dosage assign one three dose schedule follow entire 12 week treatment period . MTD define one dose level low dose 2/3 patient develop dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) . If MTD reach prior patient start give dose level , remain number patient require complete study enrol identify MTD . During Treatment Phase , safety efficacy assessment perform specified time , include : physical examination , vital sign ( weight , blood pressure , heart rate , height , weight , respiration ) , adverse event assessment , ECG , laboratory assessment . Treatment phase lab assessment perform specified visit include CBC differential , reticulocyte , complete chemistry panel , LDH , serum ferritin , Hb F percentage , F-cells , thyroid function testing , inflammatory marker , exploratory study , urinalysis ( microscopic evaluation indicate ) , urine pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . Approximately 10 ml ( 2 teaspoon ) blood collect treatment visit . For patient , minimum 3 sequential 12-lead ECGs , separate least 5 minute , must perform Day 1 ( baseline ) Day 5 pre-dose 3 hour post-dose . Other ECG 's ( Day 29 Day 57 ) single pre-dose recording Study personnel place telephone call patient Days 50 71 ass interim study drug compliance obtain information regard adverse event may occur study visit . Study drug initially dispense baseline visit every four week thereafter . Study drug accountability assess every visit . All baseline assessment complete prior first dose study drug . Follow-up A follow-up visit perform 4 week Day 85 visit . Follow-up assessment include : physical examination , vital sign , adverse event assessment , ECG , laboratory assessment ( CBC differential , reticulocyte , complete chemistry panel , LDH , Hb F percentage , F-cells , inflammatory marker ) . Approximately 10 ml ( 2 teaspoon ) blood collect follow-up visit . Optional genetic sub-study Exploratory genetic lab do subject agree participate . Histone acetylation methylation assay gamma gene perform assessment mechanism action panobinostat . Approximately 15ml extra blood collect four separate visit .</detailed_description>
