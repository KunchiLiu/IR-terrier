	<brief_summary>The aim study establish whether treatment ST low-molecular-weight heparin preventive therapeutic dos prevents disease progression thromboembolic event ( deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism ) , whether efficacy low-molecular-weight heparin differs regard dosage use ( prevention , treatment ) , recognize group patient treatment heparin efficient , well determine factor influence efficacy ST treatment heparin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Low Molecular Weight Heparin Superficial Vein Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Until recently thrombophlebitis regard benign self-limiting disease . Recent study show various complication , especially vein thrombosis pulmonary thromboembolism , often accompany ST. An observational study ( Prospective Observational Superficial Thrombophlebitis - POST ) show three month onset disease thromboembolic event occur 10 % patient : pulmonary embolism 0.4 % , disease progression 3.1 % disease recurrence 1.9 % patient . Therefore , ST frequently regard part thromboembolic syndrome . On basis evidence refer anticoagulant , especially heparin , use often treatment ST instead anti-inflammatory drug non-steroidal antirheumatics . Several study perform far examine efficacy standard low-molecular-weight heparin various dos , final conclusion efficacy treatment ST heparin establish yet . A study Marchiori colleague show 8-12-day treatment ST preventive therapeutic dos low-molecular-weight heparin significantly reduce progression relapse disease , thromboembolic complication . Another study demonstrate low-molecular-weight heparin combination elastic compression significantly effective compression alone . Comparison preventive therapeutic dos low-molecular-weight heparin give patient period one month disease onset show difference efficacy prevention disease progression thromboembolic complication . The standard ( unfractionated ) heparin also show effective prevent disease progression , however , prevent thromboembolic complication . It also clear long treatment heparin last . So far one study compare efficacy treatment various dose low-molecular-weight heparin one month three month ' duration ; demonstrate 1-month treatment low dos heparin effective 3-month treatment therapeutic dos heparin . A recent study ( CALISTO ) compare efficacy preventive dos fondaparinux ( 2.5 mg ) placebo 3,000 patient ST conclude anticoagulant treatment ST probably significantly influence prevention thromboembolic complication ( Abstract present 5th ASA Annual Meeting American Society Hematology ) . Results recent study therefore show heparin ( standard low-molecular-weight heparin ) various dos prevents ST progression , final agreement emerge whether prevent occurrence thromboembolic complication well . Interpretation result difficult heterogeneity patient include certain study especially unavailability subgroup analysis , would help establish whether treatment heparin effective certain group patient ST present form disease . Latest ( 2008 ) guideline prevention venous thromboembolic event adopt American College Chest Physicians ( ACCP ) recommend treatment least preventive median dose low-molecular-weight heparin standard heparin duration le 4 week . This recommendation base low evidence level ( level 2B ) . In study investigator therefore try ascertain whether extensiveness thrombophlebitis distance end blood clot saphenofemoral saphenopopliteal junction influence efficacy ST treatment heparin . The investigator shall also monitor expression systemic inflammatory parameter might relate efficacy treatment progression disease .</detailed_description>
