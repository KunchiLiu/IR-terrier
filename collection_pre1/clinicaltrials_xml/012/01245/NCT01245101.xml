	<brief_summary>This study examine whether intensification raltegravir suppressive antiretroviral regimen HIV infect patient poor immune restoration beneficial effect cryptic viral replication immune system . Specifically , investigator examine effect raltegravir intensification ART episomal cDNA frequency , immune activation , CD4+ cell count apoptosis , marker microbial translocation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-center , open-label , double-arm , crossover study include approximately 40 HIV-infected subject establish suppressive HAART least 2 year evidence undetectable HIV-1 RNA level ( either &lt; 50 copies/ml RT-PCR &lt; 75 copies/ml bDNA assay ) CD4+ count &lt; 350 cells/mm3 increase CD4+count &lt; 100 cells/mm3 last 2 year . Participants ( ~20 Group 1 ~20 Group 2 ) randomly assign 1 2 treatment arm describe Table 1 : Table 1 . Study group treatment assignment Group A Raltegravir 400 mg PO q12h addition establish ART ( Part 1 ) follow washout period ART ( Part 2 ) follow ART ( Part 3 ) Group B Established ART ( Part 1 ) follow washout period ART ( Part 2 ) follow raltegravir 400 mg PO q12h addition ART ( Part 3 ) The participant ' pre-study HAART monitor ensure distribution NNRTI PI-based regimen roughly 1:1 high 2 ( NNRTI ) :1 ( PI ) . The total duration study 40 week . This include Part 1 ( 16 week ) follow Part 2 ( 8 week ) follow crossover Part 2 ( 16 week ) ( Figure 1 ) . During Part 1 participant Group A receive open-label raltegravir addition establish antiretroviral regimen Group B participant continue take establish antiretroviral regimen 16 week . After completion Part 1 , group enter Part 2 consist washout period 8 week group take establish antiretroviral regimen without raltegravir . This follow Part 3 two study group undergo crossover respect treatment assignment Part 1 Group A continue receive establish antiretroviral regimen Group B receive open-label raltegravir addition establish antiretroviral regimen 16 week . After obtain informed consent , patient enrol study , study number assign , complete history obtain , physical exam perform . Blood drawn follow laboratory exam Day 1 Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 10 , 16 , 24 , 25 26 , 40 Group A Day 1 Weeks 1 , 2 , 16 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 28 , 34 , 40 Group B : - T-cell subset - Plasma viral load - Episomal viral cDNA PCR - HLA-DR level - CD38 level Blood also draw follow laboratory exam Day 1 Weeks 4 , 12 , 16 , 24 , 28 , 36 , 40 Group A Group B determine - Plasma level LPS , 16 ribosomal DNA , sCD14 - T cell receptor excision circle - CD4+ CD8+ T-cell apoptosis At visit , direct physical exam perform as-needed-basis .</detailed_description>
