	<brief_summary>Sepsis contributes nearly 20 % hospital death lead cause death non-coronary intensive care unit . Contamination patient environment common organism MRSA , VRE C.difficile remain viable day week variety material surface . Up 90 % patient note chart critical care may contaminate potential pathogen include MRSA show healthcare worker may contaminate hospital paperwork organism originate patient . Cellomed triclosan base laminate show possess antimicrobial activity MRSA , E.Coli , Enterococcus , Stenotrophomonas Klebsiella . The study present consideration aim compare level contamination critical care observation chart coat either 'standard ' matt antimicrobial Cellomed laminate . It propose paperwork laminate Cellomed may exhibit reduced level contamination decrease potential cross infection critical care potentially area hospital clinical paperwork handle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Comparing Matt Antimicrobial Cellomed Laminates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although hand hygiene remain important intervention reduce incidence nosocomial infection , poor compliance may limit impact especially critical care unit clinical demand staff high . Although focused programme improve compliance show produce good result may sustain longer-term . Hand hygiene reduces completely eliminate hand contamination therefore transmission hand microbes near-patient environment include paperwork inevitably occur . It recommend healthcare professional undertake hand hygiene interact patient environment even contact patient take place . In practice may occur potential environment act reservoir may realise healthcare worker . Doctors review physiological trend critical care observation chart often move bed-spaces without touch patient undertake hand hygiene . Since doctor exhibit low level compliance hand hygiene programme , likely difficult persuade undertake additional manoeuvre hand paperwork recommend . Effective clean disinfection near-patient environment occur concurrently hand hygiene programme order reduce transmission . Critical care observation chart Darlington Memorial Hospital paper-based , locate near-patient hand-touch zone therefore prone contamination . It propose treat paperwork may exhibit reduced level contamination ; decrease potential cross infection result area near-patient hand-touch environment receive little attention past . Recently publish research ( 2009 ) report 90 % critical care observation chart may contaminate potential actual pathogen . It critical care nosocomial infection potentially devastate effect . Cellomed triclosan base laminate available since 2008 Celloglas , UK company specialise decorative print finish . Celloglas claim laminate possess anti-microbial activity cite three report Ciba laboratory ( Switzerland ) , Scientific Services ( UK ) Manchester University ( UK ) . All test show activity MRSA E.Coli recent test report additional activity Enterococcus , Stenotrophomonas Klebsiella compare control . To date study Cellomed carry clinical environment . Cellomed apply hospital paperwork lamination process . It propose 'treated ' paperwork exhibit reduced level contamination use clinical environment compare standard patient documentation . This prospective , randomise study compare percentage increase bacterial total viable count critical care observation chart coat one two different material ; standard matt Cellomed antibacterial laminate . Two-hundred standard white critical care observation chart provide Celloglas ( Leeds , UK ) . 100 laminated standard matt ( group 1 ) 100 anti-microbial Cellomed ( group 2 ) . The two type chart separately package Celloglas , label deliver lead investigator Darlington Memorial Hospital . The package open sterile work surface lead investigator number chart random order determine Excel spreadsheet . Randomisation restrict ensure 100 chart remain group . The lead investigator record chart type assign number analysis purpose . The chart use critical care nurse staff assign order ensure random sequence maintain . The observation chart study stored critical care unit exist non-laminated white chart remove . The observation chart thereafter use normal way define nursing practice ; blue chart patient admission white chart 24 hour period thereafter commence 8 . On placement 24 hour use , standardised section patient observation area swab one data collection researcher . The standardised area define section chart comprehensively complete patient episode therefore likely become contaminate use . Both data collection researcher fully aware standardised area prior commencement study . White chart use standardise length time chart place pre- post- clinical use swab ( white chart present 8 use exactly 24 hour ) . Blue chart use patient admission 8 variable length time therefore suitable analysis . All swab take one two data collection researcher use standard technique agree data collection commences . One dry sterile cotton swab thoroughly sample specified area white chart 8 . These chart use 24 hour therefore swab case mark chart identify number , bed space number word 'post ' . A new white patient observation chart place bed space nursing staff area swab use identical method . The swab case marked chart identify number , bed space number word 'pre ' . Over 24 hour period , chart therefore two swab take ; one pre- one post- clinical use . The exception first last day study pre- post- swab take respectively . Swabs immediately deliver laboratory inoculate onto 'plates ' permit bacterial fungal growth . Following 24 hour incubation 37 degree Celsius air , plate analyse total viable count specific bacteria identify use standard technique within accredited microbiology laboratory . Additional analysis resistance isolate Staphylococcus aureus Enterococci take place use British Society Antimicrobial Chemotherapy ( BSAC ) standard technique . All data relate total viable count specific bacteria retain Data Collection Researchers study period conclude . No interim data generate . The objective compare two group total viable count follow 24 hour clinical use compare number separately identify organism . Unpublished laboratory test show total viable count increase manual handle either laminate therefore assume TVCs increase baseline type observation chart follow 24 hour clinical use . Due claim continuous expression antimicrobial activity , potential baseline count lower Cellomed group receipt lamination factory . In addition , assume baseline contamination identical chart within two group . It therefore propose define primary outcome measure percentage increase total viable count pre- 24 hour level measure clinical use . The null hypothesis primary outcome measure difference percentage increase baseline total viable count two group follow 24 hour clinical use critical care unit . The alternative hypothesis Cellomed laminate result low percentage increase bacteria compare standard matt laminate . The secondary outcome measure compare number different type specific organism identify laboratory analysis . The null hypothesis secondary outcome difference number different type specific organism two group follow 24 hour clinical use critical care unit . The alternative hypothesis Cellomed laminate result fewer different type specific organism compare standard matt laminate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All 200 specifically prepared , laminated white observation chart present critical care include study . White critical care chart place time patient discharge exclude analysis . This due fact would place full 24 hour would available 2nd swab sample take . Blue observation chart exclude since use variable period time patient admission 8 .</criteria>
