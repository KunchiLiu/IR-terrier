	<brief_summary>The aim current project use model painful stimulation skin , muscle internal organ , possible measure activity brain center process pain simultaneously . Magnetic resonance image electroencephalography combine optimize anatomical physiological description brain activation . During administration morphine identify different brain area affect . This knowledge use : 1 . Understand mechanism morphine great extent possible today , include : 1. investigate mechanism morphine versus placebo pain signal spinal cord brain . This do combination experimental pain model , neurophysiological imaging technique ( EEG fMRI ) . This achieve subjective objective measure analgesic effect . 2. examine morphine effect communication center brain involve painprocessing . 3. model morphine pharmacokinetics ( understand body drug , . concentration blood brain ) , since central understand pharmacodynamics ( description drug body thus effect ) . 4. identify biomarkers predict whether healthy subject respond morphine experience analgesic effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The test consist one main study ( I ) one sub-study ( ) : I ) Experiments painlaboratory gastroenterology clinic , 40 healthy subject examine different pain test ) Experiments MRI scanner , 20 40 main study investigate simple pain model . The individual also participate MRI study , consist first sign An equal distribution men woman want . The trial double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover study subject investigate two seperate day receive respectively placebo morphine random order Skin stimulation Skin stimulate thermal electrical stimulus . Stimulated : - Thermal stimulus skin stimulate heat approve termotester ( Medoc termotest ) cold , hand foot immerse ice water . This harmless ice water test possible evaluate DNIC ( diffuse noxious Inhibitory control ) part pain system descend inhibitory system . - Electrical stimulation skin do : 1 ) skin forearm stimulate electrically two small surface electrode ( approx . One cm2 ) . There stimulated pain threshold , 2 ) via surface electrode place foot . This activate nociceptive avert reflex record electrode place leg . Muscle stimulation The muscle stimulate : • mechanical stimulus press muscle approve pressure algometer ( Somedic produktion AB , Sweden ) . There upper limit pressure avoid injury . Bone stimulation Bone associate pain study : • mechanical stimulus press right shin bone 15cm patella , medial tibia . Pressed handheld trykalgometer ( Type 2 , Somedic produktion AB , Sweden ) probe size 2mm diameter trial participant reach pain tolerance threshold . Visceral stimuli Stimuli rectum perform probe specifically design purpose . - mechanical stimulus applied water fill balloon glue probe . The balloon probe extend moderate pain . The expansion do slowly fill balloon 37 degree hot water . - Thermal stimulus apply flush balloon hot water ( 60 ° C ) - Electrical stimulus apply stimulation mucosa weak electrical current ( Less 80 mA ) electrodes probe . This stimulus also use record evoked brain potential .</detailed_description>
