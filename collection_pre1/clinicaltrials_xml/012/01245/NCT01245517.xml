Inclusion criterion : The criterion subject undergo regular hemodialysis longer 3 month baseline . Subjects ' age range 20 85 year old . Their baseline serum albumin &lt; 4.0 mg/dL , serum phosphate &gt; 5.0 mg/dL , eligible inclusion . Subjects enrol trial sign informed consent . We expect recruit 60 subject . Patients exclude liver cirrhosis , malignant tumor , ca n't finish education session and/or ca n't complete dietary record monthly . We recruit control group trial , eligible inclusion n't want participant education session . Intervention protocol : At baseline , investigator collect demography pre-test KAP questionnaire among subject . If subject illiterate investigator conduct face-to-face interview record answer . Dietary Phosphorus Education 6-month program implement dietitian investigator , include education , nutritional counseling dietary record monthly . The first month intensive weekly education session , 20 30 minute . Second third month monthly education session , 20 30 minute . There total 6 session trial . The last 3 month follow-up period , collect anthropometry data monthly , biochemistry measurement 3-day dietary record among subject . If subject illiterate investigator conduct face-to-face interview phone-interview complete dietary record . Investigator collect post-test KAP questionnaire , diet behavior questionnaire satisfaction questionnaires subject end trial , . If subject illiterate investigator interview subject record . This 6-months trial retrospective study collect anthropometry , biochemical measurement 3-day dietary record control subject monthly .</brief_summary>
