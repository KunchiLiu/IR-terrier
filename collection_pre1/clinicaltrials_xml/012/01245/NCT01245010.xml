	<brief_summary>Research Question : Does replace Sugar Sweetened ( SS ) beverages water consumption promote decrease triglyceride blood level 9 month overweight woman ? The primary outcome variable triglyceride blood level . In addition , investigator consider secondary outcome variable follow parameter metabolic syndrome : weight , fast insulin glucose , HOMA , HDL-cholesterol , systolic diastolic blood pressure , waist circumference . The investigator also consider outcome variable glycosylated ( glycated ) hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) . Design : Two group randomize controlled trial , intervention group ( water education provision ) control group ( education provision ) . The investigator propose recruit young adult woman age &gt; 18- &lt; 45 overweight obese ( BMI &gt; 25 &lt; 39 ) , consume least 250 calorie per day caloric beverage ( e.g. , include soft drink , juice , sport drink , sweeten tea coffee , alcoholic beverage ) The intervention group ( water education provision ) compare control condition ( education provision ) . The intervention propose carry 9 month period objective measurement body weight fat , total cholesterol , LDL-C , HDL-C , fast blood glucose , HbA1C , hydration status , blood pressure , 24 hr dietary recall baseline , 3,6 9 month</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study subject The investigator propose recruit young adult woman age 18-45 overweight obese ( BMI &gt; 25 &lt; 39 ) , fast triglyceride level &gt; 150 mg/dl , consume least 250 calorie per day caloric beverage ( e.g. , include soft drink , juice , sport drink , sweeten tea coffee , alcoholic beverage ) . It important note average intake caloric beverage Mexican adolescent adult woman represent average Mexican adolescent young woman behavior Recruitment Participants recruit private weight-reduction clinic Cuernavaca , Morelos ( study site ) . Women invite participate local advertisement . Potential participant screen order evaluate fulfill selection criterion caloric beverage , BMI triglyceride level . Subsequently , order identify woman high sweetened-beverage consumption woman select fist screen follow one-month period ( referred screening stage ) , prior recruitment intervention . Screening stage This stage consist one month period follow-up woman fulfil BMI , age , triglyceride selection criterion . During period , three simplify 24-hr beverage-oriented dietary recall ( 2 week day one weekend ) collect approximately 7-10 day apart . These 24 hr-recalls exclusively seek evaluate high caloric intake come sweeten caloric beverage . Specifically , investigator evaluate consumption commercial homemade caloric sweeten beverage ( include juice , `` agua frescas '' , coffee tea add sugar ) . The investigator also measure triglyceride level blood drop collect finger prick , study site . The specimen collection process quick , minimal discomfort participant . The investigator use special lancet couple drop blood take nick finger deposit onto special analytic strip . Finally , pregnancy test perform first visit confirmation purpose . Upon conclusion screen stage eligible participant randomly assign either intervention control group . Given intervention require participant 's time involvement , throughout intervention period participant receive $ 15 compensation plus snack follow-up visit . This sum establish base estimate cost time take work attend visit cost transportation clinic . The Intervention The intervention group ( water provision ) compare control condition ( control group ) . The intervention propose carry 9 month period objective measurement body weight fat , total cholesterol , LDL-C , HDL-C , fast blood glucose , HbA1C , hydration status , blood pressure , 24 hr dietary recall baseline , 3,6 9 month . Body weight also assess time study . Eligible subject , identify screening stage , randomly assign either receive water control group . Boyh group identical , except water delivery promotion reduce intake sweeten caloric beverage substitution increase water promotion . In order pursuing , specific counsel target rationale strategy replace caloric beverage promote weight loss provide intervention group . In order ensure participant aware study group belong ( intervention control group ) , investigator provide group counsel nutrition topic , except regard water consumption information . Intervention description ( Water group ) contact : The goal subject assigned water group reduce minimum null intake caloric beverage , include carbonate ( fizzy ) non-carbonated ( still ) beverage , coffee tea sugar , milk cream add , juice drink , soy beverage , sugar sweeten `` aguas frescas '' , , energy drink , smoothy . Participants instructed drink water , replace caloric beverage mention . Subjects assign group receive biweekly home delivery water 9 month intervention period . In order answer research question outline , adherence beverage reduction recommendation must strongly promote . To support modification beverage intake intervention group , participant take part monthly face face treatment meeting hold trained dietician weight loss interventionists . These meeting hold convenient time conduct individual basis well group 8 10 participant . Participants weigh monthly meeting weekly beverage consumption data collect . The individual group meeting cover rationale strategy replace caloric beverage promote weight loss . During meeting challenge associate proposed behavior change potential solution discuss , behavioral modification strategy promote compliance also address . In addition , weight loss interventionists and/or trained dietician call participant biweekly basis order maintain enthusiasm , ask water supply status , help solve challenge face week . Water/Beverage Provision : To insure water availability , bottled water home deliver intervention period and/or available pick-up monthly follow-up visit . Based work Ebbeling et al . ( ) , investigator plan provide 2 3 liter water per person per day 2 additional serving per day provide account possible consumption family member , though discourage . Another option investigator identify order address issue consumption water provide family member provide additional water dispenser household additional large bottle water participant . The investigator insure participant receive adequate serving size fit need , instance adequate bottle size take water workplace place . The qualitative component study allow u ascertain size number water bottle provide participant . In addition , investigator meet Bonafont , Mexico , marketing team discus consumer use water bottle size issue . This invaluable selection beverage size also design water consumption nutrition promotion program . Control group contact : Like water group , subject control group receive general nutrition advice relate weight food intake . They grant specific information reduce caloric beverage intake information relate beverage consumption health . Participants group contact follow contact schedule frequency intervention group participant .</detailed_description>
