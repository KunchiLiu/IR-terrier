	<brief_summary>Schnitzler syndrome : Schnitzler syndrome rare disable autoinflammatory syndrome characterize chronic urticarial rash monoclonal gammopathy , accompany intermittent fever , arthralgia arthritis bone pain . Diagnostic criterion establish . The disease never remit spontaneously . Although standard care , promise development therapeutic option , especially anti-interleukin-1 therapy . Anakinra , synthetic analogue endogenous interleukin-1 receptor antagonist , cause rapid clinical remission 24 patient Schnitzler syndrome . However , sustain remission , continuous daily administration ( 100 mg sc ) require . The level monoclonal protein decrease . Side effect anakinra include painful injection site reaction neutropenia . Interleukin-1 autoinflammatory disease : As key proinflammatory cytokine mediate local systemic response infection tissue injury , interleukin-1 induce range response , include fever , pain sensitization , bone cartilage destruction , acute-phase inflammatory response . The so-called autoinflammatory disease mediate entirely interleukin-1 ; reduce interleukin-1 activity bring rapid sustained remission . Autoinflammatory disease include relatively uncommon disorder familial Mediterranean fever , adult juvenile Still 's disease , hyper-IG D syndrome , Behçet 's syndrome , cryoporin-associated periodic syndrome ( CAPS ) , deficiency interleukin-1 receptor antagonist ( DIRA ) Schnitzler 's syndrome . Some common condition gout type 2 diabetes , also likely autoinflammatory disease . Canakinumab : Canakinumab ( Ilaris , Novartis Pharma ) fully human anti-interleukin-1-bèta monoclonal antibody . Treatment subcutaneous canakinumab ( 150 mg ) every 8 week associate rapid remission symptom great majority child adult CAPS . Serum inflammatory marker quickly return normal . In general , side effect see small study ( 35 patient ) serious , though suspected infection ware significantly prevalent patient receive canakinumab receive placebo . The prolonged duration action canakinumab low incidence injection-site reaction may confer certain advantage interleukin-1 inhibitor ( anakinra rilonacept ) , since frequently associate injection-site reaction , require frequent administration ( daily anakinra weekly rilonacept ) . Canakinumab approve treatment CAPS US Food Drug Administration June 2009 European Medicines Agency October 2009 . Canakinumab currently evaluate potential treatment systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis , diabetes mellitus , difficult-to-treat gouty arthritis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Description study : Objectives : - Primary objective : To evaluate canakinumab 150mg every 8 week induce maintain clinical remission patient Schnitzler syndrome . - Secondary objective : - To test canakinumab 150mg induce complete clinical response Day 7 . - To assess addition canakinumab 150mg give Day 7 patient demonstrate partial response induce complete clinical response Day 14 . - To evaluate canakinumab 300mg every 8 week maintain clinical remission patient require canakinumab 150 mg additional dose Day 7 achieve clinical remission Day 14 . - To evaluate safety canakinumab treatment patient Schnitzler syndrome . - To assess change C-reactive protein ( CRP ) level treatment period . Study rationale : Although standard therapy establish Schnitzler syndrome , give rarity auto-inflammatory syndrome , report use Anakinra , synthetic analog endogenous interleukin-1 receptor antagonist , encourage . However , side effect ( include local infusion site reaction neutropenia ) need daily sc administration hamper use . The anti-interleukin-1-inhibitor canakinumab may constitute effective convenient alternative .</detailed_description>
