	<brief_summary>Aim The aim Athena project develop ostomy product softer flexible order improve comfort people stoma . The present investigation aim test well new Athena base plate adhere perspire skin without mechanical exposure ( cycle ) since ability adhere normal daily activity important quality Coloplast product . Success criterion : The investigation explorative investigation adherence Athena perspire skin evaluate . Due explorative nature study possible define specific success criterion front . However , adherence quality Athena may significantly reduce compare SenSura . Design : Two group men , one group colostomy one group without colostomy , include . The men cardiovascular fit , able cycle 1 hour moderate intensity Athena SenSura base plat apply back stomach . The adhesion base plat tested physical activity . Population : The population consist two group . Group A : Men age 50-70 without stoma volunteer . Group B : Men colostomy volunteer . Both group cardiovascular fit ( cardio investigate ) , willing cycle 1 hour moderate intensity exercise bike . The Athena test product non-CE marked , non-sterile , 1-piece ostomy product flat custom cut base plate , close bag size midi maxi intend use collect faeces colostomy . The comparator product Coloplast SenSura , 1-piece ostomy product close bag . SenSura CE-marked launched market .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Controlled Randomized Study With Athena Base Plate Versus SenSura Base Plate Perspiring Skin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim Athena project develop ostomy product , people colostomy , good comfort normal ostomy product . This attempt development soft flexible base plate follow contour body . It aim Coloplast gain knowledge whether Athena base plate adhere peristomal skin degree SenSura base plate situation perspiration without mechanical exposure . Primary endpoint Calculation area base plate detach skin . The area base visual evaluation Athena SenSura adhesives measure skin stomach 1 hour cycling moderate intensity . Secondary endpoint ( ) - Registration weight adhesive physical activity bike 1 hour warm room . - Evaluation effect skin measure number skin cell adhesive use . - Loss liquid . - Peel test ( tractive force ) adhesive skin stomach ( mechanical exposure perspiration ) . - Peel test ( tractive force ) adhesive skin back ( perspiration without mechanical exposure ) . - Calculation area detach skin base visual evaluation adhesive skin back ( perspiration without mechanical exposure ) . - Mechanical evaluation area adhesive long adhere skin stomach back . Safety endpoint ( ) - Test health ( evaluate responsible physician cardiologist ) . - Test fitness ( fitness rating ) . - Unexpected clinical occurrence ( adverse event , AE ) / Serious unexpected clinical occurrence ( serious adverse event , SAE ) . Criteria success The investigation explorative investigation adherence Athena perspire skin evaluate . Due explorative nature study possible define specific success criterion front . However , adherence quality Athena may significantly reduce compare SenSura . Design clinical study Study design The investigation design randomize control study 2 group : A B . Group A include 15 healthy men age 50-70 year volunteer . Group B include 15 men colostomy volunteer . All person include healthy cardiovascular system ( see ) allow accomplish one hour cycling moderate intensity . Both screening test take place Physicians Test Centre ( LÃ¦gernes Test Center ) , Skodsborg Strandvej 215 A , 2942 Skodsborg , Denmark . 40 participant invited screening . Those evaluated suitable invite proceed investigation . If 15 men without stoma 15 men stoma evaluate suitable test additional person invite register wait list inform participation investigation need . If less 15 men without stoma 15 men stoma evaluate suitable investigation proceed person available . There recruitment additional subject screen . The Clinical Protocol sign responsible investigator Physicians Test Centre test take place . The responsible investigator physician act investigator receive thorough information investigation . Before recruitment subject investigator train inform subject investigation fill CRF ( Case Report Form ) ( inclusive training perform different test adhesive quality ) . On day screen subject examine investigator regard health fitness . The examination take place Physicians Test Centre . The examination also include interview regard life style . The cardiological data evaluate cardiologist . Persons invite another one two test day investigator find person able one hour cycling moderate intensity without risk otherwise comply inclusion criterion .</detailed_description>
