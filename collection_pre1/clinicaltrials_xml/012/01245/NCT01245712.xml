	<brief_title>Assessing Cosmesis Toxicity Partial Breast Irradiation Using Proton Beam Irradiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PBI radiation therapy give area breast cancer remove . The study staff use proton-beam radiation deliver radiation therapy dose target way type radiation , less healthy tissue affect . Proton-Beam PBI Treatment : If take part study , proton radiation therapy deliver area lumpectomy 2 time per day , least 6 hour apart , 5 ( rarely 6 ) work day row . You place cradle beam aim area interest . You feel anything treatment deliver . The treatment last minute , may treatment room long radiation therapist need make sure position correctly beam aim correct area . The study staff show video help explain process . Although need proton radiation center 2 time day radiation therapy , free leave proton radiation center 2 treatment , able routine daily activity treatment . This type radiation stay body treatment final treatment . End-of-Treatment Tests : On last ( next-to-last ) day proton-beam PBI , follow test perform : - Your medical history record , ask side effect . - You physical exam . - You doctor fill questionnaire breast change . - Photographs take breast check appearance treat breast radiation . At end radiation treatment , ask much personal time use much personal money spend treatment . This take minute complete . Length Study : You receive 5 weekday radiation . Your participation study complete follow-up visit . Follow-up Tests : You ask return clinic follow-up test total 5 year . During first year , 4 follow-up visit : 2 week treatment , 6 week treatment , 6 month treatment , 1 year treatment . During second third year , come clinic every 6 month , year Years 4 5 . Some visit may complete phone call email . During follow-up visit , follow procedure occur : - Your medical history record , ask side effect . - You physical exam . - You doctor fill questionnaire breast change . This take minute complete . - Photographs take breast check appearance treat breast radiation . You mammogram 6 month treatment , 1 year treatment , year 5 year ( part study ) . You continue mammograms year , part normal medical follow-up health screening . This investigational study . Proton radiation therapy FDA approve commercially available breast cancer . Up 200 woman take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
