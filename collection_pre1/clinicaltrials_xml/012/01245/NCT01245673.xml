	<brief_summary>One purpose study find new combination immune system treatment ( MAGE-A3 vaccine plus activated T-cells ) allow body build protection ( `` immunity '' ) myeloma cell . A second purpose find well combination immune system treatment able control myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Immunotherapy Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) lead complete partial disappearance myeloma 2 3 patient . However , ASCT sometimes lead cure myeloma . In half patient myeloma come back 1-2 year . In 90 % patient come back 10 year transplant . One possible way improve upon result ASCT myeloma help body 's defense immune system recover faster transplant . Another way teach body 's immune system fight myeloma cell . In two early research study include 100 patient , certain type immune cell call `` T cell '' `` T lymphocytes '' take patient 's body use procedure call `` apheresis '' . These cell grow lab . After transplant , T cell put back patient . The replaced T cell help patients'immune system recover faster transplant . In addition , T cell give back patient also receive vaccination . The vaccination injection certain type pneumonia germ call `` pneumococcus '' . We find patient build protection pneumonia-causing germ . In another study , use possible myeloma cancer vaccine . However , find less half patient respond vaccine . In new study , want test different type myeloma cancer vaccine . This different cancer vaccine base protein call MAGE-A3 . The MAGE-A3 protein find 50 % case myeloma . This vaccine consist small piece protein ( call `` peptide '' ) come MAGE-A3 protein . In order help immune system respond well add two new step . First add immune system stimulant call `` Hiltonol速 '' vaccination . Hiltonol速 chemical substance turn several part immune system . It may make immune system well able respond vaccine . It test several hundred patient use dozen different type cancer germ vaccine . Second , start 100 day transplant procedure , patient get medicine call Lenalidomide . Lenalidomide already approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment myeloma . In study , want know whether Lenalidomide could help improve body 's ability respond vaccination help treat myeloma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written inform consent Patients must register Sponsor 's Monitor Patients must diagnosis myeloma Patients must meet one follow criterion : 1 . Myeloma relapse , progress , fail respond least one prior course therapy ( consist least 2 treatment cycle month therapy ) . 2 . Myeloma respond partially initial therapy complete response ( immunofixation negative normal serum free light chain study ) NOT develop minimum 3 cycle month initial therapy . 3 . Myeloma highrisk feature define presence one cytogenetic abnormality know confer poor outcome even standard autotransplants : complex karyotype ( &gt; = 3 abnormality ) , ( 4 ; 14 ) , ( 14 ; 16 ) , del ( 17 ) ( p13.1 ) , and/or chromosome 13 abnormality . Patients must measurable disease study entry Patients must age 1880 ( inclusive ) . Patients adequate vital organ function define protocol . ECOG performance status 02 ( unless due solely bone pain ) Prior Lenalidomide maintenance phase , study participant must register mandatory RevAssist速 program , willing able comply requirement RevAssist速 . Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test per protocol Lenalidomide treatment phase : able take aspirin ( 81 325 mg ) daily prophylactic anticoagulation ( patient intolerant ASA may use warfarin low molecular weight heparin ) . Pregnant nursing female HIV HTLV1/2 seropositivity Known history myelodysplasia Known history chronic active hepatitis liver cirrhosis ( suspected laboratory study , confirm liver biopsy ) . Active Hepatitis B ( define + Hepatitis B surface antigen ) ; + Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) antibody NOT exclusion Prior autotransplant allogeneic transplant More 4 distinct , prior course therapy myeloma History severe autoimmune disease require steroid immunosuppressive treatment . Active immunemediated disease include : connective tissue disease , uveitis , sarcoidosis , inflammatory bowel disease , multiple sclerosis . Evidence history significant cardiac , hepatic , renal , ophthalmologic , psychiatric , gastrointestinal disease would likely increase risk participate study Active bacterial , viral fungal infection .</criteria>
