	<brief_summary>The genotype-phenotype correlation patient Parkinson 's disease specific mutation glucocerebrosidase gene ( Gaucher gene ) know clinical experience well case report literature . The epidemiological study determine frequency heterozygous mutation glucocerebrosidase gene correlate clinical onset development measure document severity symptom ( e.g . cognitive deficit , L-dopa responsiveness , depression ) clinically well-characterized Parkinson 's patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Determine Mutations Gaucher Gene Patients With Idiopathic Parkinson 's Disease Phenotype-genotype Correlation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( also know Parkinson 's , Parkinson disease , PD ) degenerative disorder central nervous system impairs motor skill , cognitive process , function . The obvious symptom motor-related , include tremor , rigidity , slowness movement , postural instability . Among non-motor symptom autonomic dysfunction sensory sleep difficulty . Cognitive neurobehavioral problem , include dementia , common advance stage disease . PD usually appear around age 60 , although young-onset case . Gaucher 's disease genetic disease fatty substance ( lipid ) accumulate cell certain organ . Gaucher 's disease common lysosomal storage disease . It cause hereditary deficiency enzyme glucocerebrosidase ( also know acid Î²-glucosidase ) . The enzyme act fatty substance glucocerebroside ( also know glucosylceramide ) . When enzyme defective , glucocerebroside accumulates , particularly white blood cell ( mononuclear leukocyte ) . Glucocerebroside collect spleen , liver , kidney , lung , brain bone marrow . Symptoms Parkinson 's syndrome classical type 1 Gaucher patient first systematically described 1996 . In GD patient , mark heterogeneity detect term disease-causing mutation . In 17 Gaucher patient symptoms Parkinson 's disease , 12 different genotype sequence compare Parkinson 's patient , low L-dopa responsiveness , high frequency cortical dysfunction relatively early onset symptom describe . Many Gaucher patient clinical Parkinson 's symptom positive family history Parkinson 's disease among relative heterozygous mutation Gaucher gene could confirm systematic study .</detailed_description>
