	<brief_title>Omacetaxine Low Dose Cytarabine Older Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drugs : Omacetaxine design block certain protein , may cause cancer cell die . Cytarabine design insert DNA ( genetic material cell ) cancer cell stop DNA repairing . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive omacetaxine cytarabine injection skin . You receive instruction give injection . You give Research Medication Diary record drug take day . You must bring Research Medication Diary unused drug study visit . You also tell properly store drug . On Days 1-3 cycle , give injection omacetaxine every 12 hour ( +/- 3 hour ) . On Days 1-7 cycle , give injection cytarabine every 12 hour ( +/- 3 hour ) . Each cycle 4-7 week , depend well disease responds study drug . Depending disease responds study drug , number day receive injection may stay , increase , decrease . Your doctor discus . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle , physical exam . Women able become pregnant must negative blood ( 1/2 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test within 3 day receive first dose study drug . Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn every week routine test . Once response treatment , blood drawn every 2-4 week receive treatment . If doctor think need , may blood sample draw Cycles 1 2 . On Day 21 Cycle 1 ( +/- 7 day ) , every 4 week , bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy check status disease . If doctor think need , may do less often , depend response treatment . Length Study : You may receive 24 cycle treatment . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Follow-up : Once stop take study drug , follow-up 5 year . Every 4-8 week , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . If return clinic , may blood drawn clinic close home . Every 3-6 month , contact clinic visit ask . If make clinic visit , call . The phone call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Omacetaxine FDA approve treat patient certain type leukemia . Its use study investigational . Cytarabine FDA approve commercially available treatment AML . The use drug combination investigational . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
