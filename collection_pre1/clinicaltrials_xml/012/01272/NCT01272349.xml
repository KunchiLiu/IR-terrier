	<detailed_description>: The goal study determine whether repeatedly breathe low oxygen level brief period ( termed intermittent hypoxia ) improve limb function spinal cord injury . This idea stem animal study respiration , investigator show mild intermittent hypoxia improve breathe spinally injure rat . These study show intermittent hypoxia induces spinal plasticity , strengthen neural connection motor neuron function within spinal cord . Exposure mild intermittent hypoxia trigger cascade event , include increase production key protein increase sensitivity spinal cord circuitry necessary improve breathing . The investigator initially hypothesize daily exposure intermittent hypoxia 7 consecutive day improve limb function rat humans chronic spinal injury . First , investigator compare limb function spinally-injured rat receive mild intermittent hypoxia treatment rat . The investigator measure grip strength locomotor abilities group treatment several month treatment . The investigator also examine spinal cord rat look key protein , indicator spinal plasticity . The investigator use information guide treatment protocols investigator compare limb function spinal-injured person without intermittent hypoxia treatment . The second hypothesis combine intermittent hypoxia locomotor train improve limb function spinal injury . To test idea , investigator compare limb function spinally-injured rat receive combined intermittent hypoxia treadmill train rat receive intermittent hypoxia locomotor train alone . The investigator examine key protein spinal cord rat determine whether combination hypoxia training alters indicator plasticity . The investigator also compare limb function spinally-injured human receive intermittent hypoxia locomotor treadmill train receive either treatment alone . The ultimate goal research assess potential mild intermittent hypoxia therapeutic approach stimulate recovery limb function human patient .</detailed_description>
