	<brief_summary>In order determine time LNG-IUS insertion result great proportion woman use LNG-IUS 6-months post-partum , perform randomize control trial interval versus immediate post-placenta insertion . Women enrol 36-weeks gestation great . At time vaginal delivery , woman randomize receive either immediate post-placenta insertion LNG-IUS routine insertion 4-8 week post-partum . All patient return 4-6 week post-insertion 6 month post-partum confirm correct position LNG-IUS . The primary outcome sub-study number LNG-IUS correct position 6-months . Secondary outcome include assess safety post-placental LNG-IUS insertion difference acceptability symptom experience participant . This sub-study Contraceptive Choice Project , prospective cohort study aim improve use long-acting contraception remove financial barrier already enrol 5,000 patient . Association study CHOICE offer unique advantage include infrastructure support subject recruitment , retention completion follow-up well cover cost LNG-IUS device . We hypothesize , despite high expulsion rate , woman randomize receive LNG-IUS immediately placenta delivery high rate LNG-IUS continuation due poor rate follow interval insertion group . This likely particularly noticeable patient population , largely uninsured poor access healthcare . Further , typical symptom LNG-IUS insertion include bleed cramping , may disguise post-partum period . Published report immediate post-placenta insertion focus expulsion rate report symptoms satisfaction rate .</brief_summary>
