	<detailed_description>Preschool age child often severe bout cough and/or wheeze lead visit doctor 's office , urgent care , emergency room often hospitalization . APRIL-OCELOT randomize , double-blind , placebo control study 600 preschool child history significant wheezing episode year prior enrollment . All child enter APRIL portion study , compare azithromycin placebo , give 5 day early sign upper respiratory tract illness , prevent development low respiratory tract symptom . APRIL 78 week study , participation end earlier child require fourth course APRIL treatment develop significant low respiratory tract symptom . Only child develop significant low respiratory tract symptom APRIL enter OCELOT portion study , compare oral corticosteroid placebo treat low respiratory tract symptom measure Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure ( PRAM ) . OCELOT participation complete 14 day . Children may reenter APRIL complete OCELOT .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1271 month age . Recurrent significant wheezing past year ( follow ) : &gt; 3 episode , â‰¥1 clinically significant* ; OR &gt; 2 clinically significant* episode ; OR &gt; 4 month daily controller therapy AND &gt; 1 clinically significant* episode . * Clinically significant episode : require follow : ( 1 ) systemic corticosteroid ( oral injectable ) , ( 2 ) unscheduled physician office visit , ( 3 ) ED visit , ( 4 ) urgent care visit , ( 5 ) hospitalization . Up date immunization , include varicella ( unless subject already clinical varicella ) . If subject need varicella vaccine , arrange primary care physician must receive prior randomization . Willingness provide informed consent child 's parent guardian . Participants meet follow criterion NOT eligible enrollment , may reenrolled exclusion criterion resolve : &gt; 4 course systemic corticosteroid past 12 month . More 1 hospitalization wheezing illness within precede 12 month . Use longterm controller medication asthma , include inhaled corticosteroid , leukotriene modifier , cromolyn/nedocromil , theophylline 8 month ( cumulative use ) past 12 month . Current use high step 2 NAEPP asthma guideline therapy ( e.g . mediumhigh dose ICS alone combination therapy lowmediumhigh dose ICS + LABA , montelukast , theophylline cromolyn ) . NOTE : child evidence wellcontrolled symptom immediately precede study entry receive Step 2 controller therapy ( presence selfreported symptoms average 2 time per week le 2 night per month nocturnal awakening , require albuterol , 4 week precede visit 1 ) may enrol controller therapy discontinue upon study entry . Use OCS past 2 week . Daily symptoms &gt; 2 nocturnal awakening , require albuterol , average last 2 week . Use antibiotic past month . Current treatment antibiotic diagnose sinus disease . Participation presently past month another investigational drug trial . Evidence family may unreliable nonadherent , may move clinical center area trial completion . Contraindication use systemic corticosteroid azithromycin . Clinically relevant gastroesophageal reflux . Concurrent medical condition asthma likely require oral injectable corticosteroid study . If receive allergy shot , change dose within past 3 month . Participants meet follow criterion NOT eligible enrollment , may reenrolled : Gestation less late preterm define birth 34 week gestational age . Presence lung disease asthma , cystic fibrosis BPD . Evaluation screen process assure adequate evaluation lung disease perform . Presence significant medical illness ( cardiac , liver , gastrointestinal , endocrine ) would place study subject increase risk participate study . Immunodeficiency disorder . History respiratory failure require mechanical ventilation . History hypoxic seizure . History significant adverse reaction study medication ingredient . The child significant developmental delay/failure thrive , define cross two major percentile line last year age gender .
