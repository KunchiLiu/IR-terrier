	<detailed_description>Epidemiological study definitively show fruit vegetable consumption important factor prevention age-related disease cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) osteoporosis . Citrus fruit among fruit frequently consume worldwide , essentially juice . Citrus fruit exclusive source particular class dietary flavonoid , namely flavanones . Grapefruit consume whole fruit juice correspond quantitatively significant source specific flavanone call naringin . Some scientific data obtain animal study vitro experiment suggest flavanones could exert positive effect several biomarkers cardiovascular osteoporosis risk . However , , clinical proof efficacy compound far obtained clinical trial need . The main goal project ( 1 ) characterize effect long-term grapefruit juice consumption vascular bone protection ( 2 ) ass specific role naringin , potential protective effect . To reach goal , randomize , cross-over clinical trial perform 52 healthy post-menopausal woman ( 50 65 year old , 3 10 year since menopause , waist &gt; 88 cm ) . Such population share increase risk CVD osteoporosis . They consume two period 6 month either 340 ml grapefruit juice control isoenergetic beverage . Major outcome measure baseline end experimental period .</detailed_description>
