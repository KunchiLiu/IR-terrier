	<brief_title>Computed Tomography Dose Reduction Using Sequential Fast Pitch Sprial Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development novel CT scanner capable sequential fast-pitch spiral technique patient ( Siemens Definition Flash ) represent potentially crucial technical innovation particularly critical juncture . National healthcare system pressure deliver accurate cost-effective diagnosis increase number patient CT angiography various setting proven , highly accurate technique show improve diagnostic efficiency reduce cost care . However , increase concern lifetime attributable risk cancer radiation relate diagnostic procedure . Such concern extend radiation-based procedure contribute cumulative lifetime radiation exposure patient . The Flash scanner hold promise substantially reduce exposure result variety examination . The CT DOSE multicenter trial therefore design validate extent dose reduction attendant use Flash scanner cardiothoracic scanning , determine whether image quality preserve spite significant dose reduction .</detailed_description>
