	<detailed_description>The goal study examine effect repeat breathe episode mild intermittent hypoxia ( reduced oxygen ) training hand strength grasp ability follow cervical spinal injury , determine whether change result improved hand function . If , change may indicate hypoxia-induced spinal plasticity ( ability nervous system strengthen neural pathway base new experience ) , could result improvement hand use person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . This idea stem animal study respiration , investigator show intermittent hypoxia induces spinal plasticity , strengthen neural connection within spinal cord mechanism know respiratory long-term facilitation . Exposure mild hypoxia trigger oxygen sensor nervous system result cascade event , include increase production key protein , increase sensitivity spinal cord circuitry necessary improve respiration . Because previous work use animal model show similar event occur along non-respiratory pathway , investigator propose investigate whether comparable dose scheme daily , mild intermittent hypoxia positively affect upper limb function person cervical SCI . First , investigator hypothesize daily exposure intermittent hypoxia training ( 7 consecutive day ) result sustain improvement rat forelimb function dose-dependent . To test hypothesis , investigator quantify effect variation number intermittent hypoxia episode forelimb function cervical spinal injured rat . Second , investigator hypothesize daily exposure intermittent hypoxia training improve hand function person cervical spinal injury . To test hypothesis , investigator quantify effect mild intermittent hypoxia exposure , use protocol derive animal model , volitional grip strength grasp function person cervical SCI . The effect mild intermittent hypoxia , know increase spinal motor activity , assess possible therapeutic intervention promote functionally useful hand recovery . Results study valuable identify novel strategy control spinal neuron excitability improve motor function person spinal cord injury .</detailed_description>
