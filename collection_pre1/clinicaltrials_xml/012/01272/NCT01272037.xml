	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III clinical trial study well tamoxifen citrate , anastrozole , letrozole , exemestane without chemotherapy work treat patient breast cancer spread begin breast surround normal tissue ( invasive ) . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy , use tamoxifen citrate , may fight breast cancer block use estrogen tumor cell . Aromatase inhibitor , anastrozole , letrozole , exemestane , may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether give tamoxifen citrate , anastrozole , letrozole , exemestane effective combination chemotherapy treat patient breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect chemotherapy patient node positive breast cancer high recurrence score ( RS ) Oncotype DX . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival ( OS ) , distant disease-free survival ( DDFS ) local disease-free interval ( LDFI ) receipt chemotherapy interaction RS . II . To compare toxicity across treatment arm . III . To perform assay test ( particular prediction analysis microarray [ PAM50 ] risk relapse score ) , develop validated measure potential benefit chemotherapy compare Oncotype DX . IV . To determine impact management Oncotype DX patient-reported anxiety ( co-primary Health-Related Quality Life [ HRQL ] outcome ) prior screen , disclosure test result , randomized trial . V. To determine impact Oncotype DX initial management cost node-positive , hormone receptor ( HR ) -positive , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -negative breast cancer . VI . To compare patient-reported utility ( e.g. , quality life [ QOL ] ) randomize chemotherapy versus chemotherapy . VII . Using model DFS information trial , estimate cost-effectiveness management Oncotype DX v usual care . VIII . To determine role assay ( e.g. , PAM50 ) predictor DFS , DDFS , LDFI patient randomize chemotherapy versus chemotherapy . IX . To determine impact treatment chemotherapy versus chemotherapy patient-reported fatigue cognitive concern ( secondary HRQL outcome ) . X . To determine impact management Oncotype DX patient-reported decision conflict , perception regard Oncotype DX testing , survivor concern prior screen , disclosure test result , randomize trial ( secondary HRQL outcome ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive protocol-approved chemotherapy regimen base patient and/or physician preference . Patients receive protocol-approved adjuvant endocrine therapy comprise tamoxifen citrate , aromatase inhibitor ( anastrozole , letrozole , exemestane ) , 5-10 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive protocol-approved endocrine therapy comprise tamoxifen citrate , aromatase inhibitor ( anastrozole , letrozole , exemestane ) , 5-10 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 4 year , yearly 15 year .</detailed_description>
