	<brief_summary>Change Reflect What Was Done reason Changes Were Made . The purpose study determine ( 1 ) specific breathe treatment ( intermittent hypoxia ) promote change breathe function ( 2 ) pair breathe treatment ( hypoxia ) locomotor train enhance benefit walk recovery observe locomotor train alone ( without breathe treatment ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Breathing Walking Treatments Recovery Post-Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) disable health problem . Paralysis paresis limb trunk muscle major consequence SCI result inability walk difficulty walking . The commonly state goal individual SCI rehabilitation desire walk . Locomotor training ( LT ) use body-weight support system treadmill ( BWST ) task-specific rehabilitation intervention allow practice walk normal speed load low extremity , facilitate upright posture , hip extension . Substantial improvement ambulation occur follow locomotor training ( LT ) individual motor incomplete spinal cord injury ( iSCI ) . Despite advance activity-dependent rehabilitation , need exists define complementary strategy amplify endogenous neuroplasticity . The propose study assess therapeutic potential ( 1 ) respiratory train intervention ( acute intermittent hypoxia , AIH ) breathe function ( 2 ) combine locomotor ( LT ) respiratory ( AIH ) train intervention enhance walking recovery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults least 18 year age At least 12 month postincomplete spinal cord injury ( ISCI ) , include limited follow syndrome : Brown Sequard Central Cord Syndromes Upper motor neuron lesion ( upper motor neuron sign ( i.e . presence clonus , spasm , and/or hyperreflexia ) ) A diagnosis first time SCI include etiology trauma , vascular , orthopedic pathology Resting oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) level 9599 % Individuals ambulate independently , assistive device , walk provide manual assistance Persons use antispasticity medication must maintain stable medication dosage study Able give inform consent . Medical approval individual 's physician Current participation rehabilitation program/research protocol could interfere influence outcome measure current study History congenital SCI ( e.g . myelomeningocele , intraspinal neoplasm , Frederich 's ataxia ) degenerative spinal disorder ( e.g . spinocerebellar degeneration , syringomyelia ) may complicate protocol Inappropriate unsafe fit harness due participant 's body size and/or joint contracture severe spasticity would prohibit safe provision either training modality . Severe spasticity would prohibit safe provision training . Pregnancy woman childbearing age require undergo pregnancy test prior enrollment Unstable medical condition could interfere safety participation study ( i.e . symptomatic cardiopulmonary complication , osteoporosis , contractures significant medical complication would prohibit interfere test walk function training alter compliance training protocol )</criteria>
