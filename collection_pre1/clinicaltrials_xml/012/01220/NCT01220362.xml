	<brief_summary>Postoperative urinary retention ( POUR ) one common complication surgery neuraxial anesthesia treatment choice bladder catheterization 1 . It common practice place indwell catheter bladder patient receive epidural analgesia leave catheter long epidural analgesia maintain despite lack evidence support approach . Transurethral catheterization associate significant morbidity patient discomfort , urethral trauma urinary tract infection ( UTI ) . Prolonged catheterization primary risk factor catheter associate UTI ( CAUTI ) , one common nosocomial infection prolong hospitalisation 2 . For reason grow focus limit duration catheterization find method avoid unnecessary catheterization perioperative medicine 3,4 . Lower urinary tract function depend coordinated action detrusor muscle external urethral sphincter . Motorneurons muscle locate sacral spinal cord L1 S4 . Most afferent fiber bladder enter sacral cord pelvic nerve segment L4-S2 . Because epidural analgesia perform various level spinal cord , possible block portion spinal cord ( segmental blockade ) . Based innervation bladder sphincter L1 S4 assume epidural analgesia within segment T4-6 T10-12 minimal influence lower urinary tract function . In previous study , find , expectation thoracic epidural analgesia ( TEA ) significantly inhibit detrusor muscle voiding , result clinically relevant post-void residual require monitoring catheterisation 5 . Because study adopt before-after design , could definitively identify mechanisms responsible change bladder function . In particular , could determine whether TEA per se surgery main cause . Concerning TEA , remain unclear compound solution , local anesthetic , opioid responsible observe change low urinary tract function . The aim study compare low urinary tract function TEA two different epidural solution ( group 1 : bupivacaine 1.25 mg/ml v group 2 : bupivacaine 1.25 mg/ml combine fentanyl 2 Âµg/ml ) within segment T4-6 T10-12 postoperative pain treatment patient undergo lumbotomy open renal surgery . We expect well understand low urinary tract function TEA could lead restrictive use indwell transurethral catheter perioperatively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Acute urinary retention one common complication surgery anesthesia . It occur patient sexes age group type surgical procedure . It link several factor include increase intravenous fluid , postoperative pain type anaesthesia 1 . Micturition depend coordinated action detrusor muscle external urethral sphincter . Motorneurons muscle locate sacral spinal cord coordination occur pontine tegmentum caudal brain stem . Motorneurons innervate external urethral sphincter locate nucleus Onuf , extend segment S1 S3 . The detrusor smooth muscle innervate parasympathetic fiber , reside sacral intermediolateral cell group locate S2-4 . Sympathetic fiber innervate bladder urethra play important role promote continence locate intermediolateral cell group lumbar cord ( L1-L4 ) . Most afferent fiber bladder enter sacral cord pelvic nerve segment L4-S2 majority thin myelinated unmyelinated . There study urodynamic effect various anaesthetic agent 2-8 , mainly focus lumbar epidural anaesthesia . Under influence epidural analgesia , patient may feel sensation bladder filling , result urinary retention bladder overdistension . Overfilling bladder stretch case permanently damage detrusor muscle . Because epidural anesthesia perform various level spinal cord , possible block portion spinal cord ( segmental blockade ) . Based knowledge bladder innervation , assume epidural analgesia within segment T4-6 T10-12 minimal influence low urinary tract function . In previous study , find , expectation thoracic epidural analgesia significantly inhibit detrusor muscle voiding , result clinically relevant post void residual require monitoring transurethral catheterisation 9 . Because study adopt before-after design , could definitively identify mechanism responsible bladder dysfunction . In particular , could say whether thoracic epidural analgesia per se surgery cause bladder dysfunction . Furthermore , remain ingredient , whether local anesthetic , opioid behind change void function . Objective In previous study , find TEA significantly inhibit detrusor muscle voiding , result clinically relevant post-void residual require monitoring catheterization similar finding 5,30 . Because study adopt before-after design , could definitively identify mechanisms responsible low urinary tract dysfunction . In particular , could say whether TEA per se surgery cause low urinary tract dysfunction . Furthermore , remain unclear compound epidural solution , local anesthetic , opioid behind observed change low urinary tract function . The objective study determine TEA per se surgery cause bladder dysfunction drug epidural solution responsible effect . Methods Randomised control double-blind study . Patients randomly allocate one two group computer-generated randomization list . Randomization stratify gender , order reach equal number male female two group . Patients investigator blind epidural solution administrate .</detailed_description>
