	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy CollaRx® Bupivacaine Implant Men After Open Laparotomy Herniorrhaphy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inguinal herniorrhaphy common surgery ; common surgical method use include laparoscopic open placement synthetic mesh . The use synthetic mesh greatly reduce risk hernia recurrence regardless method use placement . Managing postoperative pain prevent morbidity open mesh herniorrhaphy remain considerable medical challenge . Bupivacaine local anesthetic ( pain medicine ) establish safety profile . Collagen protein find mammal . The CollaRx Bupivacaine implant thin flat sponge make collagen come cow tendon contain bupivacaine . When inserted surgical site , collagen break bupivacaine release site little absorbed blood stream . The high level bupivacaine surgical site may result less pain several day surgery . This study ass pain intensity surgery patient receive either CollaRx Bupivacaine implant plain collagen sponge .</detailed_description>
