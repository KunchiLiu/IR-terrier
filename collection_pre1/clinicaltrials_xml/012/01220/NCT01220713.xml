	<brief_title>Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy ( HBO2T ) Post-Concussive Symptoms ( PSC ) After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury ( mTBI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persistent post-concussive symptom mild traumatic brain injury severe issue face readiness , retention quality life Department Defense ( DoD ) service member Veterans . The inadequacy establish treatment regimen evidence-based science post-concussive symptom ( PCS ) /MTBI force close look non-conventional treatment condition . Hyperbaric oxygen ( HBO2 ) potent intervention demonstrate efficacy dive-related injury , soft tissue healing , carbon monoxide poisoning . This study prospective , randomize , double-blinded control . A total 60 subject randomly assign one three treatment arm study : 20 subject 1.5 atm ab oxygen equivalent HBO2 treatment , 20 subject 2.0 atm ab oxygen equivalent HBO2 treatment 20 subject sham treatment ( placebo exposure equivalent breathe atmospheric air ) . The protocol utilizes pre- post-treatment comprehensive performance battery allow meaningful clinical outcome broad understanding effect treatment . This project represent collaboration Department Defense ( DoD ) , Richmond Veterans Administration Medical Center ( VAMC ) Virginia Commonwealth University . Service member recruit military bases/treatment facility ( MTF ) , receive hyperbaric oxygen exist DoD hyperbaric chamber evaluate establish Virginia Commonwealth University-Center Rehabilitation Sciences Engineering ( CERSE ) , collaborative research center co-located Richmond VAMC VCU .</detailed_description>
