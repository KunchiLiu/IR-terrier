	<brief_summary>This study hop determine whether nitric oxide along oxygen first 20 minute life infant need help breathe reduce percentage total exposure oxygen time frame . Although use oxygen management breathe important part support baby immediately delivery , evidence much exposure oxygen may lead potential problem baby later . Oxygen exposure harmful premature baby develop lung .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inhaled Nitric Oxide ( iNO ) Adjunct Neonatal Resuscitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current Neonatal Resuscitation Program ( NRP ) guideline suggest use supplemental oxygen fraction inspire oxygen 1.0 neonatal resuscitation term preterm newborn . Exposure supplemental oxygen preterm baby show significant toxicity . Even minimal exposure first hour life show associated morbidity include late onset cancer . The transition fetal circulation neonatal circulation complex process require lung inflation decrease pulmonary vascular resistance . Endogenous nitric oxide , along oxygen , play major role facilitate transition decrease pulmonary vascular resistance . It know whether exogenous nitric oxide would facilitate transition . In study , propose novel approach resuscitation preterm infant inhale nitric oxide ( iNO ) use adjunct oxygen primary goal reduce supplemental oxygen exposure . This study design double-blind , randomize , -placebo- control pilot trial strict monitoring parameter transition delivery room .</detailed_description>
