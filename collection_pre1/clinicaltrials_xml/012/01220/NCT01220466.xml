	<criteria>Male female , race , least 18 year old time consent form sign . The refractive error , base manifest refraction ( adjusted optical infinity ) , must MRSE 15.00 D manifest cylinder 0.00 6.00 D ; MRSE +9.00 D cylinder 0.00 +6.00 D ; manifest cylinder ( 1.00 6.00 D ) great magnitude sphere , cylinder sphere opposite sign . BSCVA 20/20 better . UCVA : Myopes must 20/40 worse . Subjects Hyperopia mixed astigmatism , treatment may base difficulty maintain UCVA 20/40 evidence spectacle/contact lens dependence distance , document investigator . Wavefront diameter ≥ 4.0 mm . Sufficient agreement manifest refraction ( adjusted optical infinity ) iDesign System refraction ( sphere , cylinder , axis ) allow treatment selection generation ablation profile determine investigational iDesign System software . Manifest refraction sphere within ± 0.75 D cycloplegic refraction sphere . Anticipated postoperative stromal bed thickness least 250 micron , base preoperative central corneal pachymetry minus maximum treatment depth ablate ( calculate iDesign System ) intend flap thickness . Anticipated postoperative keratometry value ( base preoperative iDesign System refraction keratometry ) appropriate . A stable refractive error ( base previous exam , medical record , prescription ) compare unadjusted preoperative manifest refraction . Subjects currently wear contact lens must demonstrate refractive stability operative eye . Rigid toric lens must remove least 2 week SCL least 3 day prior first refraction use establish stability . A second refraction change ± 0.50 D MRSE least 7 day baseline . Willing capable return followup examination duration study . Women pregnant , breastfeeding , intend become pregnant course study , determine verbal inquiry , another condition associate fluctuation hormone could lead refractive change . Subjects ametropic amblyopic fellow eye meeting inclusion criterion fall within indication treatment use VISX® STAR S4 IR™ Excimer Laser . Concurrent use systemic ( include inhale ) medication may impair heal , include limited : steroid , antimetabolite , isotretinoin ( Accutane™ ) within 6 month treatment , amiodarone hydrochloride ( Cordarone™ ) within 12 month treatment . Acute chronic disease , illness , treatment would increase operative risk ( e.g. , immunocompromised , autoimmune disease , connective tissue disease , clinically significant atopic disease , diabetes , etc. ) . Subjects cardiac pacemaker , implanted defibrillator , implanted neurostimulator , active electrical implant . Ocular condition ( high myopia ) may predispose subject future complication , history evidence active inactive corneal disease Previous intraocular corneal surgery might confound outcome study increase risk subject . Known sensitivity inappropriate responsiveness medication use postoperative course . Concurrent participation clinical study .</criteria>
