	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) patient dialysis Fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23 ) serum level elevate , effect non calcic phosphate binder : sevelamer carbonate . This treatment could lead diminution FGF23 serum level due diminution intestinal absorption dietary phosphate . In addition , investigator describe impact FGF23 level monitoring main phosphocalcium metabolism marker phosphatemia , intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH ) , serum calcitriol phosphaturia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The total length study 14 week divide 2 part first part screen period stay 1 2 week second period treatment permanent dosage 12 week . During screen visit ( Vo ) inclusion non inclusion criterion check patient consent collect . Biological analysis perform . If patient still eligible reception biological result , randomize receive , either sevelamer carbonate , either placebo . The study treatment begin randomisation visit ( V1 ) dosage 2 tablet 3 time per day ( correspond 4.8g/d sevelamer carbonate patient take active medication ) . Patient see every 2 week first visit ( +/-5days ) 6 week ( visit2/day15 , visit3/day30 , visit4/day45 ) 12 week randomisation visit ( visit5/day90 ) . This visit include biological analysis , compliance evaluation , adverse event report , concomitant treatment report . After consent signature , adverse event collect end study patient ( Visit5 end study visit ) . Serious adverse event collect 30 day date end study . The dosage study treatment follow study period except phosphatemia ( evaluated one analysis ) find normal range plan protocol . In case , dosage adaptation : - If visit phosphatemia equal 0.8 mmol/l superior 0.5 mmol/l , study treatment dosage need reduce 2 tablet 3 time per day 1 tablet 3 time per day . - If next blood punction , phosphatemia still equal 0.8 mmol/l superior 0.5 mmol/l , study treatment stop `` end study '' visit perform . - If one study visit , phosphatemia equal 0.5 mmol/l , study treatment stop immediately end study visit perform .</detailed_description>
