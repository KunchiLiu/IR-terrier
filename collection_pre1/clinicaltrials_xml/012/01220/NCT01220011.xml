	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Conservative Management Laser Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although demonstrate overall benefit fetoscopic laser surgery first-line treatment twin-twin transfusion syndrome ( TTTS ) , indication early stage TTTS controversial . Indeed , conservative management close follow-up offered center first-line management QUINTERO stage 1 TTTS , although strategy formally compare first-line fetoscopic placental surgery . The objective trial compare strategies patient stage 1 TTTS favorable obstetrical parameter international randomize controlled trial . Patients randomize conservative management follow weekly basis long syndrome remain stable use obstetrical fetal parameter adequate gestational age reach allow delivery . Cases progress stage â‰¥ 2 worsen obstetrical parameter follow-up group actively treat percutaneous laser coagulation . Patients allocate `` immediate laser '' group treat fetoscopic laser surgery within 24 h follow randomization . The primary end-point encompasses survival neurological morbidity age 6 month foetus randomize . Analyses power computation use cluster-trial methodology account inter-twin correlation , many benefit traditional design use per-pregnancy outcome . With proportion 60 % 75 % meaning clinically relevant difference 15 % group , 200 fetus equivalently 100 pregnancy would need arm reach power 80 % alpha-risk 5 % , allow 2 interim analysis base upon LAN-DEMETS boundary O'Brien-Fleming function . Inclusion criterion , intervention randomisation investigate preliminary survey across potential participating center . Based survey , anticipate 3 year need achieve request number patient . This trial answer important question help management tailor surgical indication stage 1 TTTS .</detailed_description>
