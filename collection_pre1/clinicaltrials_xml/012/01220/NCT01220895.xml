	<detailed_description>As herpes virus , infection CMV think result primarily reactivation latent virus . Transmission virus also occur donor marrow infusion allogeneic red cell , leukocyte platelet transfusion . However , immunocompromised bone marrow transplant recipient , CMV frequently reactivate disease result progression CMV infection major cause infectious morbidity mortality . CMV infection consequence immunosuppression patient receive also may reflect delay immune reconstitution patient follow transplant . It particular concern recipient VUD ( HLA-Volunteer Unrelated Donor ) transplant often receive low dos donor T cell transplant also require great post-transplant immunosuppression GVHD prophylaxis . CMV reactivation frequent group transplant recipient . One approach improve reconstitution immunity viruses follow allogeneic HSCT adoptively transfer donor-derived virus-specific T lymphocyte , well document proven success . Existing evidence suggest adoptive cellular therapy ( ACT ) effective approach treat viral reactivation follow allo HSCT , minimal risk induce GVHD . The major advantage patient likely avoidance extend period therapy antiviral medication significant associated morbidity , sometimes require inpatient care . From pharmacoeconomic viewpoint would translate reduction cost associated standard antiviral therapy compare cost adoptive cellular therapy . It anticipate use small number highly specific T-cells allow enough CMV-specific T-cells obtain vitro normal healthy CMV-seropositive donor peripheral blood transplant product single leucapheresis procedure absence concurrent lympholytic immunosuppression combine profoundly lymphopenic environment allow expansion maintenance anti-CMV response vivo . This current study randomise prospective phase II study pre-emptive adoptive cellular therapy CMV follow T cell deplete allogeneic HSCT unrelated donor . The study base earlier phase I-II study CMV-specific cellular therapy ongoing phase III study CMV-specific adoptive cellular immunotherapy immunocompromised recipient allogeneic sibling donor HSCT base selection CMV-specific T cell two different methodology ( CMV-IMPACT ) . The proof safety sibling donor set strengthens case extend therapy unrelated donor setting , potential risk benefit great . The current study investigate use CMV-specific T cell select mobilised blood collect time stem cell apheresis multimer technology unrelated donor setting . The selection CMV-specific T cell select mobilised blood time stem cell apheresis contrast methodology use CMV-IMPACT study selection perform non-mobilised blood product produce second study-dedicated apheresis . Two significant issue remain unresolved CMV-ACE/ASPECT study ; infusion safe HLA-matched un-related donor set CMV-reactive T cell derive transplant product equivalent activity vivo cell derive second apheresis use sibling donor study ( CMV-IMPACT study ) . The study test hypothesis ACT augment impair CMV immune function post-transplant reduce requirement CMV antiviral drug therapy without cause increase GVHD ; determine efficacy pre-emptive CMV-specific adoptive cellular therapy follow T cell deplete allogeneic HSCT respect reconstitution CMV-reactive T cell . There multiple method T cell depletion available , difference likely effect immune reconstitution . The study restrict patient receive alemtuzumab-containing conditioning protocol , risk CMV infection great . ACT administer day 21 post transplant receive ex-vivo T-cell deplete graft day 28 receive vivo T cell depletion , single dose immediately upon single CMV-DNA PCR+ result . In summary study multicentre , prospective , control , open label , randomise ( 2:1 ) study pre-emptive infusion CMV-specific T cell select multimer selection technique plus standard CMV antiviral therapy versus standard CMV antiviral therapy alone . The primary objective determine efficacy pre-emptive CMV-specific ACT follow T cell deplete allogeneic HSCT respect reconstitution CMV-reactive T cell subsequent vivo expansion CMV-reactive T cell post infusion ACT . In addition individual group compare duration antiviral therapy number reactivation episode , plus GVHD incidence .</detailed_description>
