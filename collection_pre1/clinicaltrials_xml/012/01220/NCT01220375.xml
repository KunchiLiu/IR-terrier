	<detailed_description>Background High-dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell support current standard procedure first-line treatment young patient myeloma fit intensive treatment . Current practice Switzerland stem cell mobilization combination chemotherapy G-CSF stimulation myeloma patient fit high-dose chemotherapy melphalan autologous stem cell transplant . For mobilization chemotherapy , single dose vinorelbine commonly use , produce mild myelosuppression . G-CSF start day 4 daily basis , allow stem cell apheresis usually day 8 . In subsequent study , evaluate use pegylated G-CSF give single injection day 4 together vinorelbine . We find regimen equally feasible , reliable allow collection stem cell equally high percentage . In current proposal , suggest continue line research investigate mobilization use chemotherapy vinorelbine . We propose study feasibility mobilization chemotherapy absence growth factor , thus without G-CSF , combination Plerixafor . Objective Primary objective : To assess feasibility collection &gt; 6 million CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells/kg body weight 2 day . Secondary objective : Assessment safety plerixafor mobilization collection peripheral blood stem cell ; feasibility intravenous plerixafor application stem cell apheresis one-day procedure ambulatory basis ; evaluation engraftment peripheral blood stem cell mobilize vinorelbine plerixafor ; evaluation cost mobilization plerixafor . Methods Chemotherapy vinorelbine give standard dose day 1 , ambulatory basis . In part A ( 10 patient ) , G-CSF give s.c. , divide two daily dos start day 4 collection stem cell . Plerixafor give i.v . application day 8 dose 240 microg/kg b.w . Stem cell collection initiate 4 hour later day 8 , least 20 x 103 CD34+ cell / ml peripheral blood detect . In case insufficient collection , procedure repeat day 9 , include repetition plerixafor application . Part B ( 30 patient ) : If combination plerixafor vinorelbine find feasible absence unexpected toxicity , additional 30 patient studied part B study . No G-CSF administer part B , otherwise treatment plan part A . High dose Melphalan use condition regimen . After transplantation , G-CSF give subject start day +5 PBPC reinfusion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Symptomatic stage I stage II III myeloma patient standard firstline nonmelphalan contain induction treatment . Patients must fit subsequent consolidation highdose chemotherapy melphalan autologous stem cell support . Standard induction chemotherapy comprise regimens include thalidomide , bortezomib , lenalidomide ( 4 cycle ) , alone combination dexamethasone . Combinations novel agent allow well induction VAD regimen . Patients must achieve least partial response accord Blad√© criterion induction chemotherapy . Patient must age 1870 year , ECOG &lt; 2 give voluntary write informed consent . Platelets count 50 x 109/l without transfusion support within 7 day laboratory test . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) 1.0 x 109/l without use colony stimulate factor . Corrected serum calcium &lt; 3 mmol/L . Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) &lt; = 1.5 x ULN . Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &lt; = 1.5 x ULN . Total bilirubin &lt; = 2 x ULN . Creatininclearance &gt; = 50 ml/min . Negative pregnancy test within 14 day prior registration woman childbearing potential . Patients childbearing potential must implement adequate measure avoid pregnancy study treatment additional 12 month . No pregnant lactating patient allow . Exclusion Criteria Patients previously treat melphalan extensive radiotherapy bone marrow . Patients 4 cycle chemotherapy Lenalidomide . Patients fit autologous stem cell transplantation . Patient receive colony stimulate factor . Patient underwent plasmaphereses within 4 week enrolment . Patient major surgery within 4 week enrolment . Patient serious medical condition could potentially interfere completion treatment accord protocol would impair tolerance therapy prolong hematological recovery . Seropositive HIV antibody . Patient know hepatitis B surface antigen positive active hepatitis C infection . Patient active systemic infection require treatment . Female patient pregnant breast feeding . Compromised renal function evidence measure calculated creatinine clearance &lt; = 50 ml/min . Subject currently enrol , yet complete least 30 day since end another investigational device drug trial receive investigational agent .</criteria>
