	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE Since sedation increasingly administer non-anesthesiologists , patient safety sedation become increased interest Joint Commission Accreditation Healthcare Organisations ( JCAHO ) . The current standard respiratory monitoring patient sedation continuous pulse oximetry visual assessment patient . Clinical research demonstrate hypoxemia , secondary depress respiratory activity , principal risk sedation . Microstream capnography relatively new technology carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) monitoring . The technique base emission selective infrared wavelength exactly match CO2 absorption . Due efficient selective emission process small sample CO2 necessary detect alveolar hypoventilation , accuracy maintain low flow sample rate . Therefore , capnography provide useful information frequency , effectiveness regularity ventilation , pulse oximetry procedure accomplish deep sedation . According previous report capnography provide early detection alveolar hypoventilation hypoxemia occur nonintubated patient thereby improve patient safety sedation . This study provide new information efficacy capnography early detection hypoxemia nurse-administered propofol sedation adult . Previous study , involve paediatric randomize study study adult gastrointestinal endoscopy , outcome study capnography patient sedate midazolam combination fentanyl meperidine.4 5 Therefore , ass efficacy intervention base capnographic monitoring respiratory function nurse-administered propofol sedation . In previously conduct study independent observer monitor capnographic display prompt medical team change respiratory activity . In follow clinical trial examine normal practice assessment capnogram nurse qualify sedation management . 2 . OBJECTIVES At Centre Contraception , Sexuality Abortion ( CASA ) Leiden abortion procedure perform deep sedation use propofol . These procedure attend anesthesiologist patient 's monitoring perform nurse qualified patient sedation management , use pulse oximetry clinical judgement . Supplementary oxygen routinely give . The purpose study investigate use capnography improve patient safety deep sedation . This study examine effectiveness capnography early detection therapy alveolar hypoventilation deep sedation comparison standard monitoring pulse oximetry abortion procedure . The randomized controlled trial determines whether utilize capnography woman undergo deep sedation propofol ( monotherapy ) abortion procedure provide early detection suboptimal ventilation reduce hypoxemia . Unlike previous study determine investigate daily practice nurse qualify sedation management ass capnography instead independent observer assess capnography . Therefore , nurse qualify patient sedation management abortion doctor train assessment capnography trial start . The implication study monitor deep sedation may generalize healthy patient minimal invasive procedure , particularly trained anesthesiologist attendance . 3 . STUDY DESIGN This protocol describe prospective , open , randomize control trial two study arm . All patient receive standard care monitoring perform medical staff . The study examine whether capnography prevents patient respiratory event deep sedation abortion procedures.Patients randomize standard care group receive standard care use pulse oximetry . In capnography arm , respiratory monitoring perform pulse oximetry capnography . If capnogram indicate sub-optimal ventilation and/or apnea , denote flat line capnometer ≥ 15 second , respiratory rate ≤ 6 , end-tidal CO2 &gt; 50 mmHg , medical staff intervene arouse patient , perform chinlift jawthrust , abandon give additional propofol , provision oxygen . The nurse qualified sedation management ass capnography him/ . Medical staff patient blind allocation assignment study open design . 4 . STUDY POPULATION 4.1 Population Participants recruit Centre Contraception , Sexuality Abortion Leiden , Netherlands . The study population comprises female patient ( ≥ 18 year ) undergo abortion procedure first second trimester pregnancy . 4.2 Inclusion criterion Patients consider enrolment fulfil follow inclusion criterion : age 18 year old , abortion procedure perform 22 week gestational age , American Society Anaesthesiologists ( ASA ) class I II , ability ( mental competence ) give inform consent . 4.3 Exclusion criterion Exclusion criterion inability provide inform consent , history allergic reaction propofol , soybean egg protein , American Society Anaesthesiologists ( ASA ) class III- V , sleep apnea syndrome , seizure disorder . 4.4 Sample size calculation The sample size calculation prospective randomize control trial base comparison two proportion . The proportion patient develop hypoxemia sedation report 47 % 51 % observational studies.1 2 Qadeer et al . report reduction hypoxemia ( saturation &lt; 90 % ) additional capnography monitor 69 % 46 % Lightdale et al . report reduction hypoxemia ( saturation &lt; 95 % ) child 24 % 11 % .4 5 Based observation daily practice 58 patient CASA clinic Leiden hypoxemia ( oxygen saturation &lt; 90 % ) record 12 patient , correspond incidence 20.7 % . To show decrease hypoxemia 20 % 10 % significance level 0.05 power 0.80 , 219 patient require within arm , yield 440 patient include total . Give annual number 1600 patient expect participation rate 60 % , expect include patient within period 24 week . 5 . METHODS 5.1 Study parameters/endpoints 5.1.1 Main study parameter/ endpoint The primary outcome occurrence oxygen saturation &lt; 90 % population , measure continuous pulse oximetry . 5.1.2 Secondary study parameters/endpoints Secondary study outcome include occurrence oxygen saturation &lt; 80 % , total administer propofol dose , airway intervention ( reposition head , chinlift , supplemental oxygen , bag-mask ventilation ) , problem abortion procedure ( e.g . arousal movement patient ) , early termination procedure due respiratory problem , episode bradycardia , administration atropine . 5.1.3 Other study parameter Carbon dioxide monitor capnography provide follow parameter : apnea ( absence respiratory activity ) denote flat line capnometer ≥ 15 second , abnormal ventilation denote respiratory rate ≤ 6 , end-tidal CO2 &gt; 50 mmHg ( CO2 &gt; 6.7 kPa ) . Baseline value age , height , body weight , duration pregnancy , American Society Anaesthesiologists class , smoking , abuse alcohol drug , use soporific . 5.2 Randomisation , blind treatment allocation During trial patient randomly assign capnography group ( standard care monitor capnography ) control group ( standard care ) randomisation . The randomisation computer-generated stratified abortion doctor . Participants recruit independent observer nurse . The patient medical staff blind allocation assignment also independent observer aware randomisation assignment start procedure . 5.3 Study procedure - Daily practice CASA clinic : If patient opt abortion procedure five day statutory reflection come clinic appointment . Before procedure start , patient conversation doctor nurse decision abortion . If abortion inevitable pregnancy last longer 16 week , patient immediately admit clinic . If abortion inevitable pregnancy last 16 22 week , cervical priming misoprostol administer least 90 minute abortion procedure . - A routinely perform health questionnaire , blood pressure , heart rate blood group determination perform preparation procedure . Peripheral venous access establish hold area . Baseline characteristic study obtain routinely perform questionnaire include health question ( e.g . weight , height , smoke ) . - Patients ask participant study one nurse researcher hold area . They receive information letter able question researcher participation . - Before procedure start monitoring , include pulse oximetry blood pressure , attach patient - All patient receive standard monitoring continuous display pulse oximetry heart rate . In intervention group capnography measure use cannula nose connect capnograph , Capnostream TM 20 , Oridion Medical 1987 ltd . This capnographic device display respiratory rate , end-tidal carbon dioxide ( ETCO2 ) level , continuous waveform . - All patient sedate initial dose 100 milligram ( mg ) propofol . In addition 20-50 mg propofol administer patient discomfort lighter level sedation notice . The nurse qualified sedation management determine dos propofol previously describe sedation protocol CASA clinic . Local anesthesia cervix perform 10-20 ml lidocaine 1 % . - When abortion procedure finish patient monitored recovery area . If fully awake extensive bleeding occur , allow leave clinic . 5.4 Withdrawal individual subject Subjects leave study time reason wish without consequence . It however note patient sedation longer ability express wish .</detailed_description>
