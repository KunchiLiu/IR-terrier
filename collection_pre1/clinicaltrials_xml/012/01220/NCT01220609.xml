	<brief_title>Ixabepilone Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Leiomyosarcoma Uterus Previously Treated With Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate ( complete partial response RECIST 1.1 ) ixabepilone patient recurrent persistent leiomyosarcoma uterus fail one previous chemotherapy regimen . II . To determine nature degree toxicity ixabepilone assess NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4 cohort patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . II . To determine level beta-III tubulin expression measure IHC woman leiomyosarcoma . III . To determine beta-III tubulin expression measure IHC predicts response ixabepilone woman leiomyosarcoma . OUTLINE : Patients receive ixabepilone intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
