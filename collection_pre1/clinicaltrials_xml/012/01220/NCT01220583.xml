	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether radiation therapy effective give together chemotherapy alone surgery treat salivary gland tumor . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study radiation therapy without chemotherapy see well work treat patient high-risk malignant salivary gland tumor remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With Without Chemotherapy Treating Patients With High-Risk Malignant Salivary Gland Tumors That Have Been Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine feasibility conduct cooperative group prospective clinical trial patient resect malignant salivary gland tumor . - Acquire preliminary efficacy data compare postoperative radiotherapy alone concurrent chemotherapy radiation use weekly cisplatin . Secondary - Compare acute toxicity 2 adjuvant treatment . - Compare long-term efficacy result 5 year late treatment-related adverse event patient receive postoperative radiation receive concurrent chemoradiation . - Investigate quality life patient-reported outcome patient enrol study . - Identify histopathology tumor marker expression patient enrol trial assemble tissue bank future correlative study . - Establish Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) baseline database salivary gland malignancy serve resource future exploration innovative and/or target approach disease . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord histology ( high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma v salivary duct carcinoma v high-grade adenocarcinoma ) nodal status ( N0 vs N1-3 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy ( 3D-CRT ) intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) 5 day week 6-6.5 week . Patients also receive cisplatin IV 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 43 radiotherapy . - Arm II : Patients undergo 3D-CRT IMRT arm I. Tissue blood sample may collect translational research study . Patients may complete quality-of-life assessment periodically . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 24 month , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
