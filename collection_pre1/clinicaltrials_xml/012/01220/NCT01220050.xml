	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND The risk fracture kidney transplant recipients 4 time higher general population . The pathogenesis post-transplant bone disease multifactorial , hyperparathyroidism play key role maintenance development post-transplant alteration bone remodelling . Vitamin D analogues key component treatment aim prevent ameliorate secondary hyperparathyroidism patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . In hemodialysis patient , intravenous paricalcitol ( 19-nor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 ) , new vitamin D analogue , achieve faster effective normalization parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) level calcitriol ( 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ) , effect associate small change serum calcium phosphorus level . Preliminary evidence also available pre-dialysis patient CKD secondary hyperparathyroidism , treatment oral paricalcitol may also reduce urinary protein excretion , effect independent concomitant treatment agent block renin-angiotensin system long-term might translate slow progression end stage kidney disease need renal replacement therapy . Renal transplant patient high risk hyperparathyroidism , largely long-lasting renal insufficiency transplant , progressive deterioration kidney function chronic allograft nephropathy ( disease proteinuria progressive decline glomerular filtration rate ) . Whether oral paricalcitol may help achieve prompt reduction serum PTH level , secondarily , urinary protein excretion renal transplant recipient secondary hyperparathyroidism worth investigate . AIMS Primary To evaluate whether 6-months treatment paricalcitol may achieve prompt effective reduction PTH serum level stable renal transplant patient secondary hyperparathyroidism . DESIGN This Prospective , Randomized , Open label , Cross-over study 6-months Paricalcitol standard treatment hyperparathyroidism . After one month wash-out form Vitamin D therapy , patient satisfy inclusion/exclusion criterion randomize two treatment arm : 1 . Paricalcitol capsule 1- 2 mcg/day/pts 26 week 2 . Standard therapy hyperparathyroidism 26 week At end first treatment period Paricalcitol Standard therapy patient cross-over treatment . After baseline evaluation eligible patient enter 6 month treatment period whit oral paricalcitol ( 1-2 mcg/day ) , standard treatment hyperparathyroidism , added-on background therapy whit calcium phosphate supplementation deem clinically appropriate .</detailed_description>
