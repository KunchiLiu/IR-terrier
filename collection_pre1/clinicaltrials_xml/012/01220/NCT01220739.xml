	<brief_summary>To assess safety preliminary efficacy combine intravenous rt-PA transcranial laser therapy ( TLT ) NeuroThera® Laser System ( refer hereafter NTS ) subject treat acute ischemic stroke . Treatment IV rt-PA must begin within 3 hour symptom onset , initiation TLT procedure must feasible subject within 6 hour stroke onset . The NeuroThera® Laser System investigational device provide noninvasive transcranial laser therapy subject diagnose acute ischemic stroke . The wavelength laser light infrared zone electromagnetic spectrum invisible naked eye .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Rt-PA + Transcranial Emission Low-Energy Lasers Acute Stroke Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study phase II ( n= 200 ) , prospective , double-blind , randomize , sham-controlled , multicenter , safety study intravenous ( IV ) rt-PA alone versus IV rt-PA plus TLT ( Transcranial Laser Therapy ) approximately 10 investigational site ( United States ) . The primary endpoint safety study occurrence symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage 36 - 48 hour stroke symptom onset . Symptomatic hemorrhage define deterioration 4 point NIHSS last least 72 hour accompany intracranial hemorrhage distribution neurological deficit identify neuroimaging scan . All follow neuroimaging scan review centrally independent reviewer presence absence hemorrhage 36-48 hour scan . The secondary endpoint study follow : - Hemorrhagic transformation without clinical consequence ( asymptomatic ) within 36-48 hour . All follow-up neuroimaging scan review centrally independent reviewer presence absence hemorrhage 36-48 hour scan . - Mortality - The modified Rankin Scale ( mRS ) score dichotomize 0-1 versus mRS score 2-6 90 day last rating patient develop intracerebral hemorrhage - Frequency SAEs AEs This study phase II ( N = 200 ) , prospective , double-blind , randomize , sham control , multicenter , safety study intravenous ( IV ) tissue plasminogen activator ( rt-PA ) versus IV rt-PA plus transcranial laser therapy ( TLT ) approximately 10 investigational site . The study population randomize two arm . One group receive sham TLT procedure ( Sham Control Group SCG ) second group receive active TLT procedure ( TLTG ) . The randomization ratio SCG TLTG 1:1 stratify order ensure balance subject distribution treatment sham-controlled group follow factor : - Stroke severity measure National Institute Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) baseline ( stratified 7-9 , 10-13 , 14-17 ) - Study Site There 6 visit study . The purpose Visit 1 determine confirm eligibility patient participation StELLAR Study document baseline information subject stroke event . This include follow standard care test procedure : non contrast head CT scan perform prior rt-PA administration , vital sign , height , weight , physical exam , finger stick blood glucose , serum urine pregnancy test ( woman childbearing potential ) . In addition , follow data obtain : prestroke mRS , NIHSS , presume location stroke vascular territory , start stop date time IV rt-PA treatment dose give , date time stroke onset , date time arrival hospital , demographic data ( date birth , gender , ethnicity ) , sociodemographic data ( education , marital status , social support prior stroke ) , medical surgical history ( specific cardiovascular , neurological , endocrine , standard question ask ) , method contraception use ( woman child bear potential ) , prior ( three day prior Screening ) current concomitant medication use , smoke history , adverse event time obtain informed consent . To eligible study , administration rt-PA follow guideline outline National Institutes Neurologic Disorders . Patients meet inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol study write informed consent obtain patient legally authorize representative .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects may include study meet follow criterion : 1 . Subject least 40 year age screening , 81st birthday . 2 . Subject receive IV rtPA per NINDS rtPA Protocol Guidelines within 3 hour symptom onset acute ischemic stroke . 3 . Subject diagnose acute ischemic stroke present health care facility time initiation NTS procedure feasible within 6 hour time stroke onset . The time stroke onset defined time change baseline neurological function occur . If time know ( e.g. , subject awakens sleep new symptom ) , last time patient observe neurologically intact must consider time onset . 4 . Documented baseline NIHSS score &gt; 7 &lt; 17 prior IV rtPA administration . Subjects transfer facility receive IV rtPA must document NIHSS certify examiner prior initiation rtPA treatment . Documentation NIHSS score via telemedicine acceptable perform certified examiner . Subjects improve prior NTS procedure still treat , unless NIHSS improve 0 . 5 . Full functional independence prior present stroke episode define follow criterion : Estimated prestroke mRS score 0 1 . Ambulates independently , may need cane walker , need assistance another person . Absence medical/physical/mental condition substantially limit subject 's ability work , study , participate leisure activity , look family home Completely independent , need supervision ( may live individual , could live alone necessary ) 6 . Negative serum urine pregnancy test female childbearing potential . 7 . Subject ( legally authorize representative ) provide write Informed Consent compliance local regulation prior enrollment study . 8 . The subject ( caregiver , applicable ) willing participate study least 90 day onset stroke . 1 . Evidence pretPA head CT intracranial , subdural , subarachnoid hemorrhage clinical presentation suggestive subarachnoid hemorrhage even initial neuroimaging scan normal . 2 . Clinical presentation consistent brainstem cerebellar stroke 3 . A rapidly improve neurological status opinion investigator make subject unsuitable participation study patient rapidly improve NIHSS 0 start NTS procedure . 4 . The subject seizure stroke onset within 7 day prior stroke onset . 5 . Sustained blood glucose &gt; 300 mg/dl &lt; 60 mg/dl 6 . Subjects , repeat measurement , systolic blood pressure &gt; 185 , diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110mmHg , post rtPA administration , opinion investigator aggressive treatment reduce blood pressure post thrombolysis require keep pressure within limit . 7 . Presumed and/or confirm septic embolus . 8 . The subject history CNS vascular wall disease ( e.g . aneurysm , AVM ) . 9 . The subject history CNS disease damage ( e.g . neoplasm dementia ) may influence subject 's outcome assessment . 10 . The subject significant skin condition ( i.e. , hemangioma , scleroderma , psoriasis , rash , open wound tattoo ) scalp find directly three TLT procedure sit . 11 . Planned actual use intraarterial thrombolytic medication clot retrieval device , diagnostic therapeutic interventional neurovascular procedure , include mechanical recanalization , whether successful unsuccessful , stroke episode . 12 . Subject previously participate another investigational drug device trial within precede four week . 13 . Subject female pregnant lactating ( within previous 30 day ) , childbearing potential unless surgically sterile and/or partner use medically acceptable method birth control . 14 . The subject implant kind head ( i.e . clip aneurysm , embolised AVM , implantable shunt Hakim valve ) . 15 . Any use lightactivated drug ( photodynamic therapy ) within 14 day prior study enrollment . 16 . The subject participate NEST1 , NEST2 , NEST3 Study . 17 . The subject coexist terminal disease may limit life expectancy medical condition ( e.g . morbid obesity , substance abuse ) may , clinical judgment Investigator , independently influence subject 's outcome course study . 18 . The subject otherwise determine , base opinion Investigator , unsuitable candidate enrollment study .</criteria>
