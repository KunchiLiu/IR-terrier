	<brief_title>Evaluation Anti-cancer Immunotherapy Combined With Standard Neoadjuvant Treatment Patients With WT1-positive Primary Invasive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct two consecutive segment ( Phase I Phase II ) , specific objective . Active follow-up three year . Patients study allocate cohort . Cohort A include postmenopausal patient hormone receptor-positive breast cancer receive aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) neoadjuvant therapy concurrently administration 6 8 dos WT1 anti-cancer immunotherapy ( WT1 ASCI ) /placebo start Day 0 . AI treatment administer daily duration either 18 ( 6 dos WT1 ASCI/placebo ) 24 week ( 8 dos WT1 ASCI/placebo ) . Cohort B include breast cancer patient receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy concurrently administration WT1 ASCI/placebo start Day 0 . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy Cohort B consist either 1 ) 6 dos WT1 ASCI/placebo : 6 cycle-treatment chemotherapy regimen consist 6 , three-weekly cycle anthracycline/taxane-based therapy , 2 ) 8 dos WT1 ASCI/placebo : 8 cycle-treatment regimen consist 4 three-weekly cycle anthracycline-based therapy follow 4 three-weekly 12-weekly taxane administration without trastuzumab . Cohort C include patient Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -overexpressing breast cancer receive neoadjuvant trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) therapy combine chemotherapy concurrently administration WT1 ASCI/placebo start Day 0 . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy Cohort C consist either 1 ) 6 dos WT1 ASCI/placebo : 6 cycle-treatment chemotherapy regimen consist 6 , three-weekly cycle anthracycline/taxane-based therapy , 2 ) 8 dos WT1 ASCI/placebo : 8 cycle-treatment regimen consist 4 three-weekly cycle anthracycline-based therapy follow 4 three-weekly 12-weekly taxane administration trastuzumab . Cohorts D E include patient hormone receptor-positive HER2 non-overexpressing breast cancer receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy . For patient Cohorts D E , WT1 ASCI/placebo ( placebo applicable Cohort E patient ) administer Day 14 three-weekly cycle chemotherapy . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy Cohorts D E consist either 1 ) 6 dos WT1 ASCI/placebo : 6 cycle-treatment chemotherapy regimen consist 6 , three-weekly cycle anthracycline/taxane-based therapy , 2 ) 8 dos WT1 ASCI/placebo : 8 cycle-treatment regimen consist 4 three-weekly cycle anthracycline-based therapy follow 4 three-weekly taxane administration without trastuzumab . Enrolment Cohort E conditional absence safety signal adequate induction immune response WT1 ASCI Cohort D ( define &gt; = 40 % response rate base post-Dose 4 anti-WT1 antibody response least six patient ) . If criterion meet , 60 patient ( 40 receive WT1 ASCI 20 placebo ) identical eligibility criterion enrol Cohort E. In case adequate safety and/or immunogenicity obtain Cohort D , recruitment Cohort E initiate . The protocol update follow Protocol Amendment 4 , April 2013 , lead update study design .</detailed_description>

The patient 's tumor show WT1 antigen expression . The patient one follow histologically confirm breast cancer subtypes : Estrogen receptor and/or progesterone positive tumor . Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) overexpressing breast cancer . HER2negative breast cancer . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( performance status 0 1 time study treatment allocation . Baseline leave ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50 % measure within six week prior study treatment allocation echocardiography multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan . The patient show normal organ function accord follow parameter ( measure within six week prior treatment allocation ) : : Hemoglobin : Within normal range accord institutional standard . Absolute leukocyte count : Within normal range accord institutional standard . Absolute lymphocyte count : Within normal range accord institutional standard . Platelet count : Within normal range accord institutional standard Alanine aminotransferase : ≤ 2.5 x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) Aspartate aminotransferase : ≤ 2.5 x ULN Total bilirubin : ≤ 1.5 x ULN . In case know Gilbert 's syndrome ≤ 2 x ULN Serum creatinine : 1.5 x ULN Calculated creatinine clearance : &gt; 50 mL/min A female patient childbearing potential may enrol study , patient : practiced adequate contraception 30 day prior study product administration , negative pregnancy test within one week prior treatment allocation agree continue adequate contraception entire treatment period 2 month completion study product administration series.In view investigator , patient comply requirement protocol . Written inform consent obtain patient prior performance study specific procedure . The patient inflammatory breast cancer , define clinically significant erythema breast and/or document dermal lymphatic invasion . Diagnosis establish incisional biopsy . Prior concomitant neoadjuvant antibreastcancer treatment chemotherapy , immunotherapy / biological response modifier , endocrine therapy , radiotherapy , unless authorize specifically protocol . The patient know human immunodeficiency virus positive . The patient symptomatic autoimmune disease , limited multiple sclerosis , lupus , inflammatory bowel disease . Patients vitiligo exclude . The patient know difficulttocontrol hypertension , coronary artery disease , arrhythmia require treatment , clinically significant valvular disease , cardiomegaly chest Xray , ventricular hypertrophy electrocardiogram previous myocardial infarction congestive heart failure . The patient history allergic reaction likely exacerbate component investigational product use study . The patient concurrent severe medical problem , unrelated malignancy , would significantly limit full compliance study expose patient unacceptable risk . The patient ( ) previous concomitant malignancy site , except effectively treat malignancy consider investigator highly likely cure . The patient psychiatric addictive disorder may compromise his/her ability give inform consent comply study procedure . The patient receive investigational nonregistered product within 30 day precede first dose study product plan use study period . The patient require concomitant treatment immunosuppressive agent systemic corticosteroid prescribe chronic treatment . The patient significant disorder coagulation receive treatment warfarin derivative heparin . Patients receive individual dos low molecular weight heparin outside 24 hour prior WT1A10 + AS15 ASCI/placebo administration eligible .
