	<brief_summary>Vinorelbine ( NVB ) platinum compound anticancer agent broad spectrum efficacy , clinically preclinically proven synergism partially overlap toxicity . Combinations vinorelbine platinum compound limited neurotoxicity among used palliative regimen variety solid tumor , include NSCLC , breast cervical cancer . The oral platinum analogue satraplatin ( SATRA ) bring clinical development antitumor activity toxicity comparable carboplatin , together good acceptability oral administration.The recent availability oral formulation anticancer agent proven efficacy indication likely become valid option could affect clinical daily management . The oral administration vinorelbine satraplatin might represent reasonable option palliative treatment patient advance breast cancer , NSCL , GU GY tumor curative treatment provide .</brief_summary>
