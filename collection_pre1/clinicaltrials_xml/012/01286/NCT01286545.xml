	<brief_summary>Long term data efficacy safety anti-TNF treatment infliximab patient ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) beyond 5 year lack . These data important patient AS usually young withdrawal anti-TNF therapy patient almost always lead disease relapse . Furthermore still unclear whether long term anti-TNF treatment AS patient inhibit radiographic progression . Patients participate EASIC DIKAS trial respectively treat infliximab within study 7 10 year respectively follow use clinical outcome parameter every 6 month assess efficacy safety long term treatment . Furthermore radiographs spine , do clinical indication , analyze . It hypothesize anti-TNF treatment infliximab effective safe time period 9 12 year respectively long term anti-TNF therapy may inhibit radiographic progression spine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>European Ankylosing Spondylitis Infliximab Cohort ( EASIC ) Follow Registration Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) frequent subtype spondyloarthritides ( SpA ) ( Braun et al.Lancet 2007 , 369:1379-90 ) . Treatment nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) cornerstone treatment disease widely use suppress inflammation ameliorate spinal pain ( Zochling et al . : Ann Rheum Dis 2006 , 65:442-52 ) . There evidence antitumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) therapy highly effective SpA , especially AS psoriatic arthritis . Thus , TNF blocker may even consider first line treatment patient active AS whose condition sufficiently control NSAIDs case axial disease , sulfasalazine methotrexate case peripheral arthritis ( Zochling et al . : Ann Rheum Dis 2006 , 65:442-52 ) . Long-term data anti-TNF therapy patient AS rather limited . Infliximab dosage 5mg/kg show efficacious 5 year , include short period withdrawal readministration ( Baraliakos et al . : Arthritis Res Ther 2005 , 7 : R439-44 ; Baraliakos et al . : J Rheumatol 2007 , 34 : 510-5 ; Braun J et al : Ann Rheum Dis 2008 , 67 : 340-5 ) . In EASIC study investigator also show efficacy safety infliximab treatment patient AS 5 year . Long term data treatment AS etanercept proven efficacy well ( Dijkmans B et al . : J Rheumatol 2009 , 36 : 1256-64 ) . But long term data efficacy safety treatment anti-TNF therapy beyond time period 5 year lack . These data long term treatment essential several reason . At first patient AS predominantly young age . When take account withdrawal anti-TNF therapy lead disease relapse high proportion patient , anti-TNF therapy AS patient often design continuous therapy long term basis . The second reason need long term data beyond 5 year ongoing debate whether anti-TNF agent potential inhibit radiographic progression ( Baraliakos X et al . : Ann Rheum Dis 2005 , 64:1462-6 ; van der heijde D et al : Arthritis Rheum 2008 , 58 : 3063-70 ) . Radiographic data large cohort patient treat infliximab anti-TNF blocker long time period could contribute answer important question .</detailed_description>
