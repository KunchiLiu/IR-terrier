	<brief_title>Study Improve Renal Function After Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delayed graft function ( DGF ) generally define need dialysis first 7 day transplantation although definition also include failure improve preexist renal function . DGF important problem renal allograft transplantation affect approximately 25 % transplant cadaveric kidney . It generally observe delay graft function associate reduced graft survival . In addition association DGF graft loss , DGF impose economic burden due prolong hospitalization dialysis . The strong association occurrence DGF ischemia around time transplantation . Aside approach minimize ischemia time use antibody induction , good specific therapeutic option prevent treat delay graft function . This study design evaluate safety activity investigational drug improve renal function patient undergone renal transplantation sign symptom significant renal injury risk dialysis .</detailed_description>
