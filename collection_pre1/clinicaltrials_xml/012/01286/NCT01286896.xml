	<brief_summary>The purpose prospective study determine safety feasibility pharmacokinetically ( PK ) guide dose sunitinib 30 patient . At day 15 ± 1day , day 29 ± 1day 8 week ± 1day sunitinib treatment sunitinib SU12662 trough level measure . Depending sunitinib SU12662 trough level ( toxicity ) dose adjustment make .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Individual Pharmacokinetically ( PK ) -Guided Sunitinib Dosing : A Feasibility Study Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sunitinib orally available inhibitor vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGFR ) , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , cytokine receptor ( c-KIT ) , receptor tyrosine kinase ( FLT-3 ) activity . Sunitinib proven effective single agent several solid tumor type approve use advance renal cell cancer ( RCC ) imatinib-resistant -intolerant gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GISTs ) . However , large percentage patient ( 30 50 % ) , dose reduction require multiple grade 2 toxicity due grade 3 4 toxicity . Therefore , currently use dose schedule optimal . Recently , dose-efficacy relation establish sunitinib treatment . This large meta-analysis pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data study perform mRCC patient , GIST patient patient solid tumor , clearly show relationship sunitinib exposure efficacy tolerability . Both time progression ( TTP ) overall survival ( OS ) significantly well mRCC patient high area curve ( AUC ) compare low AUC . This observed sunitinib exposure also active metabolite SU12662 . In addition , significant relationship exposure probability partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) mRCC patient ( p=0.00001 ) , indicate dose intensity patient high possible . Target plasma concentration sunitinib plus metabolite ( N-desethyl sunitinib ) range 50 100 ng/mL , deduce pharmacokinetic ( PK ) / pharmacodynamic ( PD ) preclinical data . Since dose-efficacy relation sunitinib treatment solely establish retrospective ( meta- ) analysis patient treat several study , propose perform prospective feasibility study 30 patient PK guide dose sunitinib . If PK guide once-daily continuous sunitinib dose feasible , RCT mRCC patient perform compare PK guide dose standard sunitinib dose schedule .</detailed_description>
