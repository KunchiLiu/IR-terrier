	<brief_summary>Surgical site infection ( SSI ) breast axillary surgery occurs often clean surgical procedure . Infection set tissue expander devastate lead early implant loss fail reconstruction . Surgical drain note potential source surgical site infection . Hypothesis : Bacteria present surgical drain tissue expander reconstruction may decrease simple inexpensive local antiseptic intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Drain Antisepsis After Tissue Expander Breast Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical Site infection breast surgical procedure occur frequently clean surgical procedure . Considering large number patient undergo breast-related procedure per year increase use immediate breast reconstruction placement tissue expanders immediate implant reconstruction , surgical site infection involve implant result removal fail reconstruction . The primary aim study determine chlorhexidine disk application irrigation drainage bulb dilute Dakin 's solution ( buffered sodium hypochlorite solution ) tissue expander breast reconstruction immediate implant reconstruction , effectively decrease rate bacterial colonization drain fluid compare standard care . Methods : Patients undergo bilateral immediate reconstruction tissue expander placement one surgical site treat standard drain care treat drain antisepsis regimen . Drain antisepsis intervention consist two measure : 1 ) placement chlorhexidine sponge dress drain exit site , 2 ) twice daily irrigation drainage bulb dilute Dakin 's solution ( buffer hypochlorite ) . All patient undergo semiquantitative culture drain bulb one week postoperatively . This culture repeat time drain removal , simultaneous culture fluid bulb well internal segment remove drainage tube . All patient evaluate clinical sign infection adverse reaction drain antisepsis follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
