	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess effect bortezomib myeloma-related bone disease , analyze bone mineral density ( BMD ) patient Multiple Myeloma ( MMY ) receive high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation primary treatment MMY ( single- double-transplant ) . Eligible patient randomize ( study treatment assign chance like flip coin ) either bortezomib observation alone . Patients bortezomib arm receive treatment bortezomib total 4 cycle . All subject follow total 24 month randomization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label ( people involve know identity intervention ) , multicenter , multi-country parallel group study ( group patient treat time ) patient Multiple Myeloma ( MMY ) receive high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation primary treatment MMY ( single- double-transplant ) . The purpose study assess effect bortezomib myeloma-related bone disease analyze bone mineral density . Approximately 80 % patient MMY may experience myeloma-related bone disease . Myeloma-related bone disease may cause skeletal complication , include bone pain , bone lesion , abnormal fracture super-elevated calcium concentration blood . This study investigate safety efficacy experimental drug , bortezomib , consolidate response primary treatment compare consolidation treatment . The analysis study exploratory nature , since study address pre-defined statement design generate valid hypothesis safety efficacy issue . Bortezomib currently market treatment different type cancer include MMY . Bortezomib show promote bone formation increase number bone-regenerating cell preliminary study . In present study , effect bortezomib bone formation assess dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) measure bone mineral density , measure quality bone structure . Several bone marker measure serum sample . Bone marker indicator bone activity . Patients evaluated eligibility within 14-day screening period , provide write informed consent . Eligible patient randomise either bortezomib observation alone . Baseline efficacy safety assessment available Cycle 1 Day 1 prior administration study medication . Randomization stratify bisphosphonate treatment ( use ) baseline age ( 65 year versus less 65 year ) . The treatment period define time patient actively receive study treatment . Patients bortezomib arm receive treatment bortezomib total 4 cycle start alternative MMY treatment earlier . Each cycle consist 5 week treatment . Subjects treatment group receive bortezomib 1.6 mg/m2 Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 cycle follow 13-day rest period ( Days 23 35 ) . Bisphosphonate therapy administer medically indicate accord local practice . Patients attend study center visit Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 treatment cycle Days 1 , 36 , 71 , 106 observation arm end treatment ( EOT ) Visit . During visit , different evaluation conduct follow treatment safety : symptom direct physical examination , vital sign laboratory test . In addition , Day 1 Cycle 3 ( prior dosing ) Day 71 observation arm , patient assess disease progression relapse measurement M-protein serum urine . If need , absence M-protein serum urine confirm immunofixation . Additional evaluation may perform document patient 's clinical status ability tolerate additional therapy clinically indicate . All patient follow total 24 month since baseline . After end treatment phase , long-term follow-up period visit 4 , 6 , 12 18 month EOT Visit . In case patient start alternative MMY treatment complete 18 month follow-up , study assessment stop , except QoL assessment , continue 18 month follow-up , long-term follow-up survival , collect every 6 month either telephone call visit study site . The follow-up survival continue patient last patient complete follow-up . In addition schedule visit , patient may additional visit clinically indicate . Every patient randomize enter long-term follow-up phase . Assessment progressive disease ( PD ) relapse complete response ( CR ) perform accord International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) 2009 criterion . Changes serum urine M-protein ( monoclonal paraprotein ) level confirm immunofixation patient without measurable serum urine M-protein level . Karnofsky performance status also assess . Safety assess monitor adverse event , physical examination ( include neurological/peripheral neurological examination ) , vital sign measurement clinical laboratory test . A total two exploratory analysis perform present study : The first analysis ( main analysis ) present completion EOT Visit ( 24-weeks data ) . The second analysis analysis end study 18 month follow-up data . Patients bortezomib arm receive treatment bortezomib 1.6 mg/mÂ² bolus infusion Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 every 5 week total 4 cycle</detailed_description>
