	<detailed_description>Metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) five year survival &lt; 10 % cause death nearly 50,000 individual United States year . Current first second line therapy mCRC include FOLFOX , XELOX , FOLFIRI combination Bevacizumab Cetuximab Panitumumab , well Xeloda , camptosar infusional 5-FU within various less intensive regimen patient tolerate full-dose chemotherapy . Current practice involve evaluation response image 2-3 month initiation therapy . Recent study demonstrate number circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) blood patient mCRC independent prognostic value term reflect disease burden well indicate response therapy . The use CTC count offer possibility predict response treat patient earlier time standard mean use CT scan . The investigator hypothesize subset CTCs cancer stem cell ( CSC ) marker know prognostic marker may improve prognostic value CTC evaluation course therapy patient mCRC . The protocol use Veridex CellSearch technology possible compare emerge technology include microfluidic device isolate CTCs GFP-expressing adenoviruses replicate telomerase-expressing epithelial tumor cell ex-vivo . The protocol enroll 200 patient metastatic colorectal cancer receive therapy . Additional propose laboratory study may unravel important biological insight relationship CTC genomic genetic profile compare primary tumor . Additionally investigator hope gain understanding potential subgroup patient high number CTCs early relapse CTC early reduction CTC number . The impact research may better prediction response mCRC therapy patient treat second line experimental therapy unlikely respond current therapy predict CTC evaluation .</detailed_description>
