	<detailed_description>Accurate epidemiological data severe influenza-associated hospitalization fatality child lack Germany . The purpose study primarily , assess number severe , laboratory-confirmed influenza child hospitalize paediatric intensive care unit due suspect acute respiratory infections/ influenza/ influenza-triggered complication child develop influenza paediatric intensive care unit hospitalization , well number influenza-associated fatality . In addition aim assess clinical feature , severity , risk factor , complication , diagnostic procedure , treatment outcome severe , laboratory-confirmed influenza ( acute respiratory infection ) child . Another objective estimate proportion laboratory-confirmed influenza case child hospitalize paediatric intensive care unit acute respiratory infection evaluate number proportion paediatric intensive care unit hospitalization due viral acute respiratory infection . Additional aim estimate ( minimum ) incidence severe influenza-associated hospitalization Bavarian child estimate ( minimum ) incidence acute respiratory infection . Ideally , study conduct October 2010 March 2012 Bavarian ( Germany ) hospital paediatric intensive care unit paediatric intensive care bed ( neonatology exclude ) . To optimize report one study physician site responsible documentation , diagnostic procedure query . The local study physician receive initiation visit start season , contact study coordination ( situate University Children 's Hospital Wuerzburg ) bi-weekly phone . This local study physician summarize paediatric intensive care unit admittance log sheet , document epidemiological , demographical , clinical data questionnaire suspect acute respiratory infections/influenza patient parental informed consent ( pseudonymous data ) , draws nasopharyngeal swab -wash indicate routine procedure . A sample sent central laboratory ( Institute Virology Immunobiology , University Wuerzburg ) analysis ( influenza-polymerase chain reaction , influenza virus subtyping , viral acute respiratory infection ( respiratory syncytial virus , parainfluenza 1-4 , humane metapneumovirus , adenovirus , rhinovirus , enterovirus ) . The central laboratory analyse sample timely report result respective study site . Additional influenza-tests may also perform local laboratory , discretion hospital . All test , locally perform Wuerzburg , outcome report questionnaire .</detailed_description>
