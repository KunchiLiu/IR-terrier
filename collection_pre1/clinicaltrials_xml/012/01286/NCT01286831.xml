	<brief_title>A Single Dose Study Determine Excretion , Balance Metabolic Disposition Radiolabelled GW642444 .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-centre , open-label , single-dose study characterise metabolic disposition oral [ 14C ] GW642444 . Six healthy male subject enrolled ensure least four fully evaluable subject . Each subject receive single 200μg oral dose GW642444 contain 2 μCi ( 0.074MBq ) [ 14C ] GW642444 . Whilst subject inhouse , blood , urine faecal sample collect minimum 168 hour dose ( 7 day ) 240 hour ( 10 day ) depend amount radioactivity still excrete Day 5 . Faecal sample collection may continue home 14 day . Bile sample collect use Entero-Test string sample duodenal bile . Plasma prepare blood various sample time dose measure parent drug total radiolabelled drug-related material . Urine faeces aliquots take measure total radiolabelled drug-related material . Samples urine , faeces , plasma bile transfer separate study characterise , feasible , quantify metabolite matrix . Safety tolerability assess blood pressure , heart rate , 12- lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , clinical laboratory safety test , collection adverse event ( AEs ) .</detailed_description>
