	<brief_summary>The purpose Phase 2b study evaluate efficacy safety emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( FTC/RPV/TDF ) STR , switch efavirenz ( EFV ) /FTC/TDF STR baseline , maintain HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL Week 12 . HIV-infected patient enrol received EFV/FTC/TDF ≥ 3 month prior study start , experience safety tolerability concern ( particular , EFV-related intolerance ) , wish change alternate , better-tolerated regimen .</brief_summary>
