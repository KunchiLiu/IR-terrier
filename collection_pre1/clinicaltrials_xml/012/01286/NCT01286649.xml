	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study assess safety perform injection human autologous hair follicle cell . The study also measure impact injection hair growth . 20 patient select participation study ( 10 male 10 female ) base health status , current/past medication , ability adhere protocol-related requirement . All patient evidence mild moderate androgenetic alopecia ( AGA ) involve vertex area scalp define Ludwig ( female ) Norwood ( male ) scale . At first visit completing informed consent , patient provide blood sample test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis , syphilis one week biopsy back scalp . The provided scalp biopsy process isolate hair follicle cell replicate . Patients return clinic injection replicate cell ( autologous cell ) medium ( verum ) medium alone ( control ) two pre-selected treatment area scalp . Assessments safety/tolerability injection take place next 60 month in-clinic visit telephone follow-up visit . At visit patient overall health assess subjective objective assessment area inject either verum control . During first 24 month follow-up , digital image take scalp two treatment area inject either verum control . Furthermore 6 , 12 , 24 month post-injection , four patient ( 2 male 2 female ) time point provide biopsy injection sit histopathological analysis . At 60 month time point , patient previously provide biopsy histopathological analysis provide biopsy . Total duration patient participation approximately 63 month .</brief_summary>
