	<brief_summary>The Insulin Sensitivity use Aerobic Interval Conditioning ( ISAIC ) trial compare traditional aerobic training ( AER ) interval training ( INT ) sedentary , overweight/obese men risk pre-diabetes . The investigator randomly assign 42 individual 3 month monitor exercise use randomly assisgned design participant exercise either AER INT training condition . The AER training condition consistent `` standard-of-care '' recommendation . Exercise training entail one 3-month block either AER INT . Training consist 1 ) 1-month ramp period , 2 ) 1-month traditional aerobic training 3 ) 1-month either continue AER INT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It currently estimate type II diabetes ( T2D ) affect 5-8 % adult . Also recognize transitional group individual whose control blood glucose abnormal , yet consider diabetic . These individual classify pre-diabetes , define impaired fasting glucose ( IFG ; fast glucose 100-125 mg/dl ) , impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ; post 2-h glucose load ; 140-199 mg/dl ) . This population represent significant segment population estimate approximately 23 % Americans pre-diabetes ( IGT IFG ) . Two unifying feature associate metabolic impairment strong link obesity physical inactivity . Regular exercise positively influence IFG/IGT obesity , represent important therapy prevent progression T2D enhance several mechanism action include improve : glucose metabolism , muscle respiratory capacity , mitochondrial respiratory chain activity ÃŸ-oxidation . Importantly , dose physical activity require promote metabolic benefit appear obtainable individual little ~1000 kcal/w aerobic activity . While exercise policy statement guideline recommend exercise perform within intensity range 40-85 % V02max , new guideline , recently update Physical Activity Public Health Recommendations recognize study examine effect intensity , duration , frequency physical activity independent contribution total amount physical activity . Accordingly , write group specifically recommend , `` base recent data , indication vigorous-intensity activity may great benefit reduce cardiovascular disease premature mortality moderate-intensity physical activity ... . much work need area .
