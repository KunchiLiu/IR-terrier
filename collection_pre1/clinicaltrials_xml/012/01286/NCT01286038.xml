	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy eltrombopag people myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) thrombocytopenia progress resistant decitabine azacitidine . ( These 2 drug approve U.S. Food Drug Administration [ FDA ] improve platelet count ) . The investigator ( study doctor , study staff , sponsor ) want find effect , good bad , eltrombopag ( study drug ) may people low platelet count due MDS . The investigator also test well eltrombopag may work different dos disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study drug administer outpatient basis . The study divide two part : Stage 1 best dose eltrombopag find take forward Stage 2 . In Stage 1 study , small group participant enrol step . The first group give dose 50 mg per day study drug 8 week . If participant manageable side effect , next group participant enrol receive high dose study drug ( 100 mg per day 8 week ) . This increase dose group participant continue study doctor find high dose study drug give without cause severe unmanageable side effect 300 mg daily dose . Stage 2 include 15 participant best dose base Stage 1 part study . The participant 's dose may adjust low high dose base upon platelet count , determine study doctor . Eltrombopag supply company call GlaxoSmithKline white off-white , round film coat tablet contain eltrombopag equivalent 12.5mg , 25mg , 50 mg , 75 mg 100 mg eltrombopag .</detailed_description>

All prognostic risk group accord International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) MD Anderson Risk Model At least one prior HMTA treatment either azacitidine decitabine subsequent loss response HMTA , progression HMTA , response HMTA , define failure achieve least HI 4 cycle treatment The mean two platelet count take within 1 month prior dose must ≤50 x 10^9/L . Platelets count must reflect pretransfusion trough result obtain sooner 1 week platelet transfusion assure stable baseline platelet count . The platelet count obtain outside expect nadir prior therapy . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % Adequate liver function , evidence total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal ( patient Gilbert 's disease eligible , provided intermittent indirect hyperbilirubinemia ) , aspartic transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) . A serum creatinine concentration ≤ 2 x ULN Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation .
