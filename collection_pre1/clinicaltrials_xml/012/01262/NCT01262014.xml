	<brief_summary>Given low Responses Rates short survival time achieve conventional cytotoxic agent resistant ovarian cancer patient , new treatment option need patient population.Antiangiogenic therapy important role group patient Pazopanib particular . We go study Pazopanib able control disease-related symptom minimize side effect treatment . This aspect important treatment resistant ovarian cancer patient since treatment palliative without impact overall survival . So goal study Clinical Benefit Rate ( objective response plus stable disease rate ) achieve Pazopanib toxicity profile subgroup patient</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Investigating Pazopanib Patients With Platinum-resistant Advanced Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer consider chemo-responsive neoplasm , initial response rate systemic chemotherapy exceed 80 % integrated primary cytoreductive surgery Despite , 50 % woman diagnose epithelial ovarian cancer eventually go die disease . Six major trial publish past 15 year report median PFS patient advance disease range 16 23 month median OS lie 31 65 months.The majority patient achieve Complete Response first-line chemotherapy ultimately develop recurrent disease . These patient subdivide platinum-sensitive platinum-resistant group . In platinum-sensitive patient , disease recurrence occur 6 month cessation initial platinum-containing chemotherapy . Platinum-based therapy typically use retreat patient , light clinically meaningful response observe patient follow second platinum-based treatment.Currently , optimal treatment strategy platinum-resistant patient whose disease recur within 6 month complete initial platinum-based chemotherapy.Despite wide range available treatment , prolong survival show setting , ORR generally less 20 % . As resistant-disease curable , goal treatment patient include palliation symptom improvement quality life . Platinum-resistance therefore significant clinical problem improve treatment regimen need . In regard , molecular target therapeutic agent herald new era cancer treatment . In set epithelial ovarian cancer , grow body evidence support use anti-angiogenic agents.Platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patient often treat sequential line single-agent chemotherapy . Commonly used agent include topotecan , pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( PLD ) , weekly paclitaxel gemcitabine.Topotecan topoisomerase I inhibitor well establish therapy recurrent ovarian cancer , demonstrate efficacy platinum-resistant population . PLD license US Europe use ovarian cancer failure platinum chemotherapy recommend NCCN treatment option set . PLD topotecan compare Phase III study 474 patient tumours recurrent refractory platinum-based chemotherapy . In subgroup patient platinum-resistant tumour treat PLD ( n=130 ) , ORR 12.3 % , median PFS OS 2.1 8.2 month , respectively . The 124 platinum-resistant patient receive topotecan achieve median PFS OS 3.1 month 9.5 month , respectively , significantly different PLD group . For platinum-resistant patient , outcomes significantly different treatment group whatever treatment option acceptable.In recent study platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer patient , topotecan monotherapy show ORR 19 % 9 % use conventional weekly schedule , respectively . Angiogenesis know play critical role growth ovarian tumour may represent important target . For example , several study demonstrate increased microvessel density primary ovarian tumour associate VEGF expression predict worsened survival rate . Likewise , circulate VEGF level significantly high ovarian cancer subject advance stage diagnosis , poorly-differentiated tumour , increased level ascites compare subject early stage , well-differentiated tumour ( ) , less ascites . Tumour-derived VEGF may play role ascites formation . Angiogenesis show negative predictive factor overall survival disease-free survival woman advance ovarian cancer 18 . Blockade inhibition VEGF ( eg , use bevacizumab ) VEGFR ( use TKIs ) show effective Phase II study ovarian cancer . For example , single-agent bevacizumab show 16-21 % overall tumour response rate ( ORR ) two study previously treat patient ovarian cancer.Pazopanib potent , multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) VEGFR-1 , -2 , -3 , PDGFR-α -β c-Kit . Pazopanib show evidence antitumor activity clinical study ovarian cancer . VEG104450 Phase II study pazopanib subject ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer respond first-line chemotherapy high risk clinical recurrence ( evidenced rise CA-125 level ) . 36 subject enrol , 22 ( 61 % ) sensitive platinum relapse previous chemotherapy regimen . Final result obtain recently indicate following:10 36 ( 28 % ) subject experienced CA-125 response pazopanib response occur shortly start pazopanib administration ( median time response 29 day ) median duration response 113 day 21.Taking account thesis result , pazopanib one promising antiangiogenic therapy study ovarian cancer</detailed_description>
