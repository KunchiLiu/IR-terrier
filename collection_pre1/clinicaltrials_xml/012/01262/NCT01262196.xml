	<brief_summary>MP4OX novel oxygen therapeutic agent develop ischemic rescue therapy enhance perfusion oxygenation tissue risk hemorrhagic shock . MP4OX pegylated hemoglobin-based colloid . Due molecular size unique oxygen dissociation characteristic , MP4OX target delivery oxygen ischemic tissue . This study evaluate safety efficacy MP4OX treatment trauma patient suffer lactic acidosis due severe hemorrhagic shock . The study hypothesis MP4OX reverse lactic acidosis enhance perfusion oxygenation ischemic tissue thereby prevent reduce duration organ failure improve outcome patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase IIb Study MP4OX Traumatic Hemorrhagic Shock Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute traumatic injury , include blunt penetrate injury , often associate severe uncontrolled bleed lead hemorrhagic shock . During shock , inadequate blood flow result local ischemia tissue hypoxia ( insufficient oxygenation ) critical organ , detect increase serum lactate level trauma victim . Despite optimal care , 10 % trauma victim reach hospital alive die , many suffer organ failure . Death significant , persistent morbidity consequence trauma , traumatic injury associate lost productivity , reduce quality life , direct cost patient health care system worldwide . The primary treatment trauma support ventilation oxygenation , limit blood loss , maintain cardiovascular function organ perfuse . The patient 's airway may intubate allow oxygenate airflow lung . Mechanical ventilation use patient maintain oxygenation carbon dioxide elimination . Damage-control surgery use limit blood loss intentionally delay definitive repair patient good tolerate procedure . Blood transfusion provide maintain oxygen-carrying capacity circulation . Platelets coagulation factor infuse correct coagulopathy dilution blood consumption clot factor . Vasopressor inotropic agent may use support low cardiac output blood pressure . Renal replacement therapy may institute kidney failure occur . Despite optimal care , organ dysfunction present many patient . Hypoperfusion anaerobic metabolism organ tissue detect presence lactic acidosis . Current therapy aim support fail organ , agent accelerates repayment oxygen debt prevents shorten duration organ failure seek . Blood transfusion improve circulation oxygen-carrying red blood cell insufficient lactic acidosis present , even hemoglobin level restore . Studies critically ill intensive care patient demonstrate elevated initial 24-hour lactate level significantly correlate mortality , prolonged elevation blood lactate level trauma correlate increase organ failure mortality . Support efficacy MP4OX resuscitation severe hemorrhage shock come several preclinical study hamster , rat , swine . Using swine model uncontrolled hemorrhage resuscitation , survival great restoration hemodynamics acid-base status improve MP4OX relative equivalent volume crystalloid , pentastarch , unmodified hemoglobin . Administration MP4OX improve 24-hour survival , stabilize cardiac output arterial pressure nearly normal level , reduce lactate effectively control fluid . Importantly , benefit MP4OX observe without co-administration autologous blood , suggest blood alone sufficient achieve resuscitation , effect MP4OX additional blood . Additional support come recently complete phase IIa trauma study 51 patient lactic acidosis due severe hemorrhage . MP4OX treatment associate rapid sustain reduction high lactate level , great proportion MP4OX-treated patient normalized lactate four hour dose . There also trend toward short median hospital stay great proportion MP4OX-treated patient discharge hospital alive Day 28 . These phase IIa result suggest improve oxygen delivery utilization ischemic tissue MP4OX-treated patient , base reversal lactic acidosis , support positive result preclinical model hemorrhagic shock resuscitation .</detailed_description>
