	<brief_summary>The OtisMed Custom-fit system total knee replacement replace conventional surgical technique templating intra-operative instrumentation preoperative virtual surgery process utilize 3D model affect knee pre-operative MRI CT image . The 3D model affect knee process proprietary algorithm virtually alter pre-arthritic state filling articular defect , remove osteophyte , approximate joint surface . The software shape match knee replacement femoral tibial component preathritic knee model aligns femoral component functional flexion-extension axis femur . The final preoperative step machine custom biocompatible plastic cut block fit arthritic knee . These cut block use knee replacement surgery guide bone cut replacement component align individual patient . In study propose compare patient receive total knee replacement component OtisMed Custom-fit procedure component implant conventional manner Computer Assisted Surgery ( CAS ) . The primary outcome micromotion tibial femoral implant 1 2 year surgery . Secondary outcome include subjective outcome , accelerometric gait analysis , bone mineral density , full leg alignment , change intra-operative frontal plane alignment , intra-operative deviation surgical plan , surgery duration , OR turnover time , number instrument pan use , length hospital stay .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Knee hip arthroplasty profoundly successful operative intervention , however , joint replacement fail life expectancy knee hip arthroplasty finite . This fact largely responsible continue development new device technique joint arthroplasty surgery . The OtisMed Custom-fit technique great potential shift knee replacement surgery patient-specific paradigm . Existing study OtisMed surgery find reduced need soft-tissue release , alignment comparable conventional computer navigate surgery , reduce tourniquet time , reduce instrumentation . Although preliminary result promise OtisMed Custom-fit system still unproven , long-term follow-up study complete date . An initial report question effectiveness procedure although limited series four surgery . To definitively determine technique improvement conventional knee arthroplasty randomize controlled trial high-resolution quantitative assessment outcomes clearly call . Question 1 : Is difference micromotion pattern implant component CAS OtisMed knee system ? - Null Hypothesis : There significant difference micromotion pattern . - Alternative Hypothesis : There significant difference micromotion pattern tibial and/or femoral component . Question 2 : Do CAS knee component achieve adequate fixation underlie bone ? - Null Hypothesis : There significant continuous migration tibial femoral component 2 year indicate adequate long-term fixation implant - bone interface . - Alternative Hypothesis : There significant continuous migration tibial and/or femoral component 2 year indicate inadequate fixation implant - bone interface . Question 3 : Do OtisMed knee component achieve adequate fixation underlie bone ? - Null Hypothesis : There significant continuous migration tibial femoral component 2 year indicate adequate long-term fixation implant - bone interface . - Alternative Hypothesis : There significant continuous migration tibial and/or femoral component 2 year indicate inadequate fixation implant - bone interface . Question 4 : For proportion implant group migration continue increase two year follow-up ? Question 5 : Are inducible displacement , measure load follow-up exam , different 2 group ? Question 6 : Are significant difference bone mineral density operative knee ( proximal tibia ) body sit time ? Question 7 : Are significant difference bone mineral density proximal tibia OtisMed CAS group time ? Question 8 : Is significant difference gait symmetry measure , health status functional outcome OtisMed CAS group ? Question 9 : Is significant difference postoperative full-leg length alignment CAS OtisMed group ? Question 10 : Are significant difference frontal plane alignment curve obtain CAS system CAS OtisMed group ? Question 12 : Are significant difference quantity bone resection CAS OtisMed group ? Question 13 : Are significant difference frontal plane alignment curve obtain CAS system CAS OtisMed group ? Question 14 : Are significant difference number intra-operative deviation surgical plan CAS OtisMed group ? Question 15 : Is significant difference duration surgery ( tourniquet time ) CAS OtisMed group ? Question 16 : Is significant difference number instrument pan use CAS OtisMed group ? Question 17 : Is significant difference length hospital stay CAS OtisMed group ? Question 18 : Are intra-patient difference OtisMed surgical plan CAS surgical procedure term predict versus actual resection alignment ?</detailed_description>
