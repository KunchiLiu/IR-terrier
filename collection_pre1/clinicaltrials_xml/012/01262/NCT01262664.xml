	<brief_title>A First-in-Man , Phase I Evaluation A Single Cycle Prohibitin Targeting Peptide 1 Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : PROHIBITIN-TP01 design destroy `` white fat '' ( type fat collect around stomach associate obesity men ) . Fat known produce substance promote prostate cancer growth . Investigators want learn decrease fat slow growth prostate cancer . This first study use PROHIBITIN-TP01 human . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level PROHIBITIN-TP01 base join study . Up 5 dose level PROHIBITIN-TP01 test . Three ( 3 ) participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose PROHIBITIN-TP01 found . Study Drug Administration : You receive PROHIBITIN-TP01 injection skin 1 time day 28 day . Study Visits : On Days 1 , 8 , 15 22 : - You physical exam , include measurement weight . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . You require fast 8 hour blood test . - You ask symptom side effect may since last visit drug may take . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PK test 10 minute , 30 minute , 1 hour , 4 hour receive Day 1 Day 22 dose PROHIBITIN-TP01 . - You ECG either right within 4 hour receive study drug ( Days 1 , 15 , 22 ) . Length Study Drug Administration : You receive study drug 28 day . You longer able receive study drug disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Follow-up Visit : Within 7 day stop receive study drug , follow procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight , well measurement waist hip . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This test also include measurement PSA , testosterone , cholesterol , research test may show study drug affect . - You ask symptom side effect since last visit . - You CT MRI scan chest x-ray check status disease . - You ECG Thirty ( 30 ) day stop receive study drug , follow procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon - addition list ) collect learn immune system react PROHIBITIN-TP01 forming antibody . - You ask symptom side effect since last visit . - You ECG Long-Term Follow-Up : You contact phone e-mail every 3 month 1 year ask kidney function , current weight , prostate cancer status , side effect may . Each phone call last 5 minute . This investigational study . PROHIBITIN-TP01 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 39 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
