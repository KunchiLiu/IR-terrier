	<brief_summary>Induction chemotherapy gain momentum management locally advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) . The combination docetaxel , cisplatin , 5-FU ( TPF ) superior compare PF Phase III clinical trials73,74 . We complete Phase II clinical trial show docetaxel , cisplatin , cetuximab ( TPE ) highly active well tolerate induction chemotherapy SCCHN ( Argiris et al . ASCO 2008 ; A6002 ) . Preliminary survival result encourage . 39 patient enrolled median follow 26 month 2-year PFS 70 % 2-year OS 84 % .The combination chemotherapy plus cetuximab already standard treatment recurrent metastatic SCCHN47 . Therefore , TPE use platform addition novel agent . EGFR VEGF among important validate molecular target cancer therapy . The incorporation novel target therapy chemotherapy radiotherapy particular interest head neck cancer , may improve efficacy without significantly increase toxicity . A Phase III trial carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab without cetuximab advance NSCLC propose SWOG . Bevacizumab currently investigate SCCHN promise result . A Phase II study investigate combination pemetrexed bevacizumab ( UPCI 05-002 ) well Phase II trial cetuximab bevacizumab ( UPCI 05-087 ) recurrent metastatic SCCHN ongoing University Pittsburgh encouraging result ( ASCO 2008 ASCO 2009 ) . In study , 32 already enrol . There 1 patient grade 3 hemorrhage . The objective response rate 20 % , median PFS 2.8 month median OS 8.1 month . In order improve efficacy TPE rate complete response propose add bevacizumab TPE follow XPE regimen develop University Pittsburgh . Due non-overlapping toxicity base prior experience anticipate regimen well tolerate . Moreover , plan obtain tumor biopsy blood sample first cycle evaluate modulation biomarkers post combination therapy . Data induction TPE ( present ASCO 2009 ) indicate potential significance cytokine level patient outcome . Also , evaluate feasibility subsequent concurrent radiation , cisplatin , cetuximab bevacizumab . Patients stable disease primary could consider candidate surgical resection discretion physician , tumor resectable .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients AJCC 6th edition stage IIIIVB head neck cancer , site , include unknown primary tumor . Prior entry study resectability alternative treatment option patient determine team compose Ear , Nose , Throat Surgeon , Radiation Oncologist Medical Oncologist . Stage determination , optimal local treatment , time accord protocol determine evaluation . The unequivocal demonstration distant metastasis ( M1 ) confers ineligibility . Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis squamous cell poorly differentiate carcinoma , WHO type IIII nasopharynx . Unidimensionally measurable disease require ( RECIST 1.1 ) . No prior chemotherapy , biologic/molecular target therapy ( include prior therapy specifically directly target EGFR pathway ) , radiotherapy head neck cancer . Prior surgical therapy consist incisional excisional biopsy , organ spar procedure debulking airway compromise tumor neck dissection patient exist primary tumor . Any nonbiopsy procedure must take place &gt; 4 week &lt; 3 month initiate protocol treatment . ECOG performance status 01 . Age least 18 year . Informed consent must obtain patient prior begin therapy . Patients ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . All patient tumor tissue test HPV consent available archival tumor sample , unstained slide block previous diagnostic therapeutic procedure submit correlative study , include assessment target molecule EGFR , VEGF relate biomarkers . Also , patient must agree submit blood sample correlative study least baseline . Absolute neutrophil count equal great 1500/µl , Platelet count equal great 100,000/µl Creatinine clearance 60 ml/min high calculate use CockcroftGault formula : Calculated Creatinine Clearance = ( 140age ) X actual body wt . ( kg ) 72 X serum creatinine Multiply number 0.85 patient female Total bilirubin within normal limit AST/ALT less 3 time upper limit normal . Urine protein creatinine ( UPC ) ratio &lt; 1.0 screen NOTE : UPC ratio spot urine estimation 24 urine protein excretion UPC ratio 1 roughly equivalent 24hour urine protein 1gm . UPC ratio calculate use one follow formula : [ urine protein ] / [ urine creatinine ] protein creatinine report mg/DI [ ( urine protein ) × 0.088 ] / [ urine creatinine ] urine creatinine report mmol/L Patients prior history squamous cell basal carcinoma skin situ cervical cancer must curatively treat . Patients history prior malignancy must treat curative intent must remain diseasefree 3 year post diagnosis . Patients may receive investigational agent . History severe allergic reaction attribute docetaxel compound similar chemical biologic composition docetaxel , drug formulate polysorbate 80 . Prior severe infusion reaction monoclonal antibody know hypersensitivity component bevacizumab Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . All patient baseline EKG . If abnormality consistent active coronary artery disease detect , patient refer cardiologist appropriate evaluation management prior treatment study No patient significant baseline sensory motor neurologic deficit ( &gt; grade I neuropathy ) treat study . Because patient immune deficiency increase risk lethal Infections treat marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive patient exclude study . Appropriate study undertake patient HIV receive combination anti retroviral therapy indicate .
