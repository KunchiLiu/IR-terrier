	<brief_summary>For esophageal cancer remove surgery , choice treatment combination chemotherapy radiotherapy . We call combination- ( concurrent ) chemoradiotherapy . Chemotherapy treatment drug kill cancer cell . Both chemotherapy radiotherapy make tumour small enhance 's effect . The goal treatment chemotherapy radiation therapy cure cancer . Unfortunately small proportion patient cure treatment . Improvements outcome treatment may expect use so-called `` target '' treatment . With esophageal cancer , protein ( epidermal growth factor receptor ( kind trap ) , EGFR ) , present many tumour . This protein cause tumor grow . Panitumumab drug block function receptor ( catcher ) , possibly growth spread esophageal cancer prevent . The main objective trial see survival patient inoperable esophageal cancer improve panitumumab added standard treatment chemoradiotherapy . It also investigate whether patient tolerate addition panitumumab standard treatment . Also , biological characteristic tumor examine . In proportion patient determine enhancement cancer visible FDG-PET scan start treatment change treatment . It also evaluate treatment affect survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radio-chemotherapy With Without Panitumumab ( Vectibix® ) Irresectable Squamous Cell Carcinoma Adenocarcinoma Oesophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A complete response rate approximately 30 % achieved standard treatment irresectable carcinoma oesophagus , consist concurrent chemoradiation therapy ( 50.5 Gy + cisplatin/5-FU ) . Attempts improve outcome intensify conventional cytotoxic drug increase radiation dose successful . Future improvement likely require incorporation target agent probably add significant toxicity , use molecular predictor response early identification responder . In squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma oesophagus expression EGFR correlate poor outcome . Furthermore addition cetuximab , chimaeric EGFR antibody , radiation therapy head neck cancer non-small cell lung cancer show gain overall survival . In head neck cancer study addition panitumumab chemo-radiation therapy currently ongoing . Therefore , propose perform randomise phase II study chemo-radiation therapy without combination panitumumab ( human EGFR antibody ) irresectable squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma oesophagus without distant metastasis .</detailed_description>
