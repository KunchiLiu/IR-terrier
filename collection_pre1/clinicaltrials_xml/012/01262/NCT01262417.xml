	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficiency resorbable barrier membrane prevention abdominal peri-hepatic adhesion patient colorectal cancer require two-stage surgery resection hepatic metastasis . Eligible patient randomly assign one 2 arm : - Seprafilm group ( receive resorbable barrier membrane first surgery ) - No-treatment control group ( without seprafilm barrier first surgery ) The primary objective establish , patient colorectal cancer require two-stage surgery resection hepatic metastasis , efficiency resorbable barrier membrane ( Seprafilm ) limit abdominal peri-hepatic adhesion second operation . This study prospective multicentric phase II , control , randomize non comparative trial . A total 60 patient enrol : 45 receive Seprafilm whereas 15 assigned no-treatment control group . The inclusion period approximately 18 month . The follow period second surgery 3 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The secondary objective study : During 1st surgical procedure To evaluate immediate complication ( surgery ) , early complication ( post-surgery hospitalization ) late complication ( 1st 2nd surgery ) relation operate procedure use resorbable membrane . During 2nd surgical procedure - To evaluate abdominal peri-hepatic adhesion ( site 1st surgery ) , qualitative quantitative description . - To evaluate intestinal adhesion ( small intestine ) , quantitative description . - To evaluate immediate complication ( surgery ) , early complication ( post-surgery hospitalization ) late complication ( month follow intervention ) relation operate procedure . - To evaluate post-operative rehabilitation - To assess tumour evolution patient period 3 year 2nd surgery .</detailed_description>
