	<brief_summary>The investigator plan conduct first-stage experiment recruit ten subject , include five PD patient five non-PD patient . In begin , information collect portable motion detector use compare difference activity perform PD non-PD patient . Besides , algorithm develop identify gait pattern PD patient . Once system detect abnormal gait , shuffle festinate step freeze gait , auditory cue give PD patient caregiver side . It help patient maintain normal gait improve effectiveness rehabilitation , well prevent fall daily activity . Moreover , case accident fall , real-time fall detection mechanism alert near caregiver instant support delivers information remote family member medical personnel . After , second-stage experiment carry recruit another five PD patient . By compare gait pattern identify system identify manually staff , performance propose system fall prevention examine . For patient family member , developed system enhance patient ' safety daily activity . As medical personnel , serf affordable tool benefit rehabilitation PD patient easy manner .</brief_summary>
