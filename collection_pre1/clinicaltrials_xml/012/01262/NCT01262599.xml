	<brief_summary>Pedicled transverse rectus abdominus myocutaneous ( TRAM ) flap common post-mastectomy breast reconstructive surgery utilize patient 's tissue . The pedicled TRAM flap involve harvest skin , fat , muscle abdomen create new breast . TRAM flap complication include fat necrosis reconstruct breast , delay wound healing , abdominal bulge hernia . Pain abdominal donor site major contributor need four five day post-operative hospital stay . Pulsed electromagnetic field ( PEMF ) technology useful adjunctive therapy treatment delay union fracture , chronic wound post-operative pain . PEMF device economical disposable , incorporate unobtrusively standard post-operative dressing . The investigator recently report , double-blind , placebo-controlled study breast reduction , post-op PEMF therapy produce significant decrease pain pain medication use , along concomitant decrease IL1-beta wound bed . The propose study seek determine whether similar result obtain significantly extensive surgical procedure , like TRAM flap . Patients schedule pedicled TRAM flap breast reconstruction single breast immediately follow mastectomy enrol double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize study . Subjects assign one two group : treatment group active PEMF device placebo group sham device deliver PEMF . PEMF sham device tap breast reconstruction abdominal donor site . Patients keep device place hospital stay total two week . The investigator hypothesize subject PEMF treatment group compare placebo fast reduction pain , take less pain nausea medication , low level IL1-beta wound exudate , short hospital stay , less wound-healing complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Operations perform one two plastic surgeon perform surgery similar manner . The entire unilateral rectus abdominis muscle harvest fascial-sparing part pedicled TRAM flap . The flap shape suture chest site , abdominal fascial defect close primarily , follow polypropylene mesh overlay . Two 10 mm Jackson-Pratt ( JP ) drain place flap wound , two JPs place abdominal wound . Immediately transfer extubated patient recovery room bed , study device place reconstruct breast abdominal donor site , activate . In treatment arm , PEMF signal automatically deliver every two hour fifteen minute patient hospital .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patient decide immediate unilateral TRAM flap breast reconstruction deem candidate surgery . Patients undergone undergoing sentinel lymph node axillary lymph node dissection include . Patients candidate TRAM flap reconstruction exclude . Specific reason patient candidate determine surgeon , may include patient minimal abdominal tissue , patient multiple medical comorbidities , patient prior abdominal surgery preclude pedicled operation , patient morbidly obese . Additionally , patient opt free TRAM flap DIEP flap exclude since abdominal donor site morbidity different pedicled TRAM flap . Patients undergoing bilateral reconstruction also exclude , extensive nature surgery donorsite morbidity , might confound result .</criteria>
