	<brief_summary>Our team interest do improve function patient suffer glaucoma , chronic irreversible eye disease . Patients vision loss result disease may feel like 'given ' , lose medical system intervention offer treat eye disease . It intent investigate alternative provide patient , instead simply say , 'nothing do ' . We learn study do chronic eye disease , like age relate macular degeneration , low vision rehabilitation improve visual function . What exactly low vision ? It involve loss visual acuity , make activity read write challenge ; involve loss contrast sensitivity , make shape edges hard discern , like stair edge , person 's face . It could also involve loss peripheral , side vision symptom common glaucoma patient . Whatever cause low vision , day-to-day activity become increasingly difficult , many suffer loss independence may even become depressed . Low vision rehabilitation involve help patient use remain vision optimal , sometimes even new , way . This involve assessment person 's baseline vision , idea need . Patients give low vision aid ( magnifier , telescope , video screen magnify image , tool ) well instruction support adapt live function altered vision . Although currently exist cure glaucoma , certainly promise reversal damage do eyes chronic disease , believe type rehabilitation service may offer hope potential visual benefit patient live vision loss . Our hypothesis use state-of-the-art low vision aid patient advance glaucomatous visual loss provide improvement visual task thereby improvement quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Visual impairment , include low vision blindness , rank among ten prevalent cause disability North America ( 1 ) . Leading cause low vision disease also associate age population , include age relate macular degeneration ( ARMD ) , glaucoma , diabetic retinopathy optic neuropathy ( 1 ) . Of , irreversible vision loss commonly cause ARMD glaucoma , diseases exists cure ( 2 ) . Quality life functional ability negatively impacted vision loss blindness ( 2 ) . Loss visual ability impairs mental physical functioning , limit activity daily live ( ADL ) ( eat , dress , reading , write , mobilize , interpersonal communication etc . ) ( 3 ) . Impedance basic function secondary visual impairment lead loss independence , low self-esteem depression ( 3 ) . When pharmacological surgical intervention prove futile advanced vision loss , low vision rehabilitation may option regain lose function patient . The goal low vision rehabilitation restore lose vision rather utilize remain vision full potential thus enable patient reclaim ADL thereby independence . Our study base Veterans Affairs Low Vision Intervention Trial ( LOVIT ) , randomize control trial conduct Stelmack et al ( 4-6 ) . Their goal evaluate efficacy outpatient low vision rehabilitation program patient moderate severe vision loss secondary age relate macular degeneration ( ARMD ) . Their intervention effective improving aspect visual function compare control group . There little evidence support use low vision rehabilitation patient chronic , irreversible visual loss secondary glaucoma , currently randomize trial do . Because pattern visual loss different ARMD glaucoma , possible extrapolate ARMD data beyond ARMD cohort . Yet , ARMD experience establish proof principal use glaucoma protocol design In patient advanced glaucomatous optic neuropathy , functional loss often begin mobility difficulty ambulate ( 7 ) . In one study , patient visual field loss secondary glaucoma show diminished traffic gap judgement cross street , lead increase risk harm . As whole , group make 23 % error identify gap crossable short make safely ( 7 ) . Another researcher find 25 % patient visual field loss eye report moderate severe restriction mobility activity overall . In another study , field loss secondary glaucoma lead lower vision-related quality life score . When examine collectively , report others suggest reduce visual field glaucoma experience fall , motor vehicle accident , great overall difficulty mobility activity overall decrease quality living ( 7 ) . Visual acuity vary wide range among patient moderate severe glaucoma , overall , central vision reduction occur late disease . Some study show mild central diffuse reduction field early stage glaucoma . As visual field visual acuity decline , patient often note difficulty glare sensitivity , leave response time light dark adaptation hinder . In summary , problem often experience patient advanced glaucoma relate ambulation , reading , distance spot glare . Low vision rehabilitation aim maximize independence patient ' daily life address difficulty . It would difficult argue low vision aid rehabilitation patient visual loss positive impact patient family ; however exist little way randomize control clinical trial evaluate efficacy outpatient low vision rehabilitation interdisciplinary strategy deliver service . Given exist shortage inpatient resource staff require manage patient , outpatient program could deem cost effective practical limit health care system . Moreover , available data subject focus rehabilitation patient ARMD . There little support use low vision rehabilitation patient chronic , irreversible visual loss secondary glaucoma . As population age , expect certainty increase prevalence visual loss secondary glaucoma , begin next ten year ( 12 ) . An evaluation efficacy strategy address 'untreatable ' vision loss , patient 'end line ' glaucoma , would great significance see glaucoma devastate effect vision subsequently quality life increase greatly near future . Evidence base model outpatient low vision rehabilitation program need support implementation delivery service patient suffer moderate severe glaucoma , devastate impact daily functioning .
