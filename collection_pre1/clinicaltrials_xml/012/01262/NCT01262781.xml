	<brief_summary>The obesity epidemic reach infant toddler age group . Dietary indiscretion pregnancy , particularly current food environment , major risk factor gestational diabetes neonatal macrosomia ( &gt; 4kg newborn ) , risk factor obesity metabolic syndrome offspring , possibly even childhood . Temporal increase fructose consumption last two decade coincide temporal increase weight gain pregnancy increase birth weight , include high prevalence macrosomic newborn . Our central hypothesis high fructose consumption pregnancy risk factor infant obesity metabolic syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The `` fetal origins hypothesis '' suggest individual 's risk obesity metabolic disorder begin utero ; fetal early postnatal exposure environmental factor , maternal nutrition endocrine disrupting chemical , adversely influence early development result permanent change affect energy storage expenditure . Most study `` fetal origin '' obesity offspring focused maternal high-fat diet ; yet dietary fat consumption change appreciably last two decade . One chemical exposure pregnant mother newborn steadily increase worldwide fructose . Although ostensibly carbohydrate , fructose potent lipogenic substrate , hypercaloric state , much 30 % ingest fructose load undergoes de novo lipogenesis form triglyceride thus effect high-fat high-fructose diet term physiology outcome comparable . Substituting sucrose ( fructose + glucose ) glucose alone increase visceral adiposity , insulin resistance , dyslipidemia adult animal human . For human , fructose ubiquitous food environment , especially pregnant mother , often counsel drink juice pregnancy , deem healthy soda . The effect fructose consumption pregnancy infant birth weight adiposity yet study .</detailed_description>
