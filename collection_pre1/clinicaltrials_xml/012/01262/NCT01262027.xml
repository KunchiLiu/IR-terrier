	<brief_title>TKI258 Metastatic Inflammatory Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Dovitinib design bind protein surface cancer cell call FGF receptor . This may slow growth cancer cell kill cancer cell . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take dovitinib mouth day 5 day 2-day rest period ( 5 day on/2 day schedule ) . The first dose week Day 1 . You take dovitinib morning glass ( 8 ounce ) water least 1 hour least 2 hour eat . It important take study drug time every day . If forget take dose study drug schedule , take dose 2-day rest period , follow guideline call study staff : - If take dose Day 6 , rest Day 7 start take drug Day 1 . - If take dose Day 7 , skip Day 1 next schedule start dose Day 2 . - If take dose Day 6 Day 7 , skip Days 1 2 next schedule start dose Day 3 . - If miss dose Days 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , restart next dosing day rest Days 6 7 . - If miss dose Day 5 , rest Days 6 7 , restart dose Day 1 next week . You take additional medication include over-the-counter product herbal/alternative medication study without ask doctor . It important avoid medication know cause liver side effect . If experience intolerable side effect , study doctor may give drug help control side effect . You store study drug room temperature direct sunlight . The study drug also keep away child . About every 4 week , need bring back empty partially use bottle study drug . During Treatment : At every visit , ask side effect . Before Cycle : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Cycle 1 , around Days 8 22 : ° Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn check liver function . Cycle 2 around Day 8 : ° Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn check liver function . Every 2 cycle ( Cycles 3 , 5 , 7 , ) : - If doctor think need , photograph take skin area affect inflammatory breast cancer . - If doctor think need , x-rays , CT scan chest and/or abdomen , and/or bone scan . Before Cycle 3 : - If doctor think need , positron emission compute tomography ( PET/CT ) scan check status disease . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing . You also one-time blood draw ( 1 tablespoon ) measure level study drug blood . This sample may draw Days 12 26 Cycle 1 , Cycle 2 , Day 12 Cycle 2 . If doctor think need , test procedure may perform early . If doctor think need , ECG , ECHO , MUGA scan check heart function . Length Study : You may remain study long benefit . You take study treatment disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : After study , end-of-treatment visit within 14 day last study visit . - You ask side effect . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - If doctor think need , photograph take skin area affect inflammatory breast cancer . - If doctor think need , x-rays , CT scan chest and/or abdomen , and/or bone scan . - If doctor think need , ECG ECHO MUGA scan check heart function . - If doctor think need , PET/CT scan check status disease . Follow-up Visits : You call e-mailed every 3 month 1 year ask . This investigational study . Dovitinib FDA approve commercially available . At time , dovitinib use research . Up 33 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
