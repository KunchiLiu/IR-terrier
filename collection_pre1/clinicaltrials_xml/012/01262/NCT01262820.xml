	<brief_title>Pazopanib In Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC Lung Cancer After Progression First Line Therapy Containing Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-centered phase II trial examine pazopanib stage IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC patient progress first-line therapy contain bevacizumab . Treatment continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , study withdrawal , death . Patients progress treat discretion physician . patient initiate treatment evaluate disease control rate , primary endpoint study . The primary objective estimate disease control rate pazopanib alone patient stage IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC progress bevacizumab . Disease control rate id define complete ( CR ) + partial response ( PR ) + stable disease ( SD ) last great equal 12 week define RECIST . Secondary Objectives To estimate combine response rate ( CR + PR ) pazopanib accord RECIST To estimate progression free survival ( defined time enrollment disease progression death ) overall survival ( defined time enrollment death ) patient treat pazopanib . To evaluate safety tolerability pazopanib use National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) version 4.0 To explore potential correlation blood biomarkers clinical response . Pazopanib dose continuously throughout study . Cycle lengths identify 21 day purpose calendar . The treatment dosage administration participate subject , Pazopanib , 800 mg mouth daily 21 day cycle disease progression .</detailed_description>
