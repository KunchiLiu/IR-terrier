	<brief_summary>All subject evaluate Research Nurse Clinical Translational Research Center ( CTRC ) Outpatient Clinic obtain informed consent , brief medical history , weight , body mass index , waist/hip circumference vital sign . Additionally , blood drawn visit screen renal dysfunction ( Chem 10 ) , liver disease ( liver function test ( LFT 's ) ) , thyroid dysfunction ( TSH ) , diabetes mellitus ( HbA1C ) , chronic inflammatory state ( erythrocyte sedimentation rate ) . Subjects recruit study place low-carbohydrate diet ( &lt; 20 g/d without caloric restriction ) design either promote weight loss maintain weight stability fourteen day prior protocol consume typical `` Western '' diet design either promote weight loss ( restricted 1300 kcal/d final fourteen day ) maintain weight stability twenty-one day . Subjects recruit study lean , overweight , obese also may carry diagnosis NAFLD . Target accrual total enrollment project set 80 subject accommodate attrition screen failure . The detail low-carbohydrate diet discuss consultation Linda Brinkley , nutrition staff CTRC . Subjects chosen undergo carbohydrate-restriction teaching session CTRC dietician . Subjects initiate dietary carbohydrate-restriction keep daily dietary record seven day . At end seven day , dietary record analyze . The CTRC prepare meal final seven day diet accordance daily caloric intake calculated dietary record . Calorie-restricted participant keep dietary record one week eat typical `` Western '' diet . The dietician analyze record meal restrict 1300 kcal/d prepare CTRC final fourteen day diet . Alternatively , subject eat typical `` Western '' diet may consume prepared meal fix content carbohydrate , fat , protein unrelated pre-study dietary intake . In scenario , dietary carbohydrate content may vary 30 60 % provide information difference hepatic metabolism condition differ , clinically sustainable , carbohydrate intake . All participant admit CTRC night prior study begin overnight fast dinner . Between 18:00 09:00 , subject receive two stable isotope tracer orally : [ U-13C ] propionate 08:00 ( three 400 mg dos give 1 hour ) 70 % 2H2O 22:00 , 02:00 , 06:00 . During study subject also give 0.5 % 2H2O ad libitum . Two 500 mg acetaminophen tablet also give 08:00 . Between 08:00 09:00 subject undergo measurement respiratory quotient ( RQ ) use CTRC indirect calorimeter ( Delta Trac II ) .. Subjects intravenous catheter place infusion tracer amount [ 3,4-13C2 ] glucose , [ 1,2-13C ] β-hydroxybutyrate [ 3,4-13C ] acetoacetate initiate . At 1 ½ 2 hour initiation infusion , 50 cc blood draw perform . Voided urine collect every hour ingestion acetaminophen protocol conclude . The subject give meal discharge CTRC , mark completion protocol . The collected blood urine transport research coordinator Advanced Imaging Research Center lab analysis MRS. Another blood draw ( approximately 10 cc ) do conjunction final MRI order measure change lipid profile diet intervention . The visit entirety follow : 1 screen visit : 20 minute 1. dietician visit : 20 minute 2 . MRS visit : 45 minute 1 ( optional ) overnight visit : 20 hour</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The study compare source hepatic glucose individual age 18 65 year match age , body mass index ( BMI ) , gender , ethnicity . Enrollment number higher accommodate attrition matching . The gender equally represent cohort . The ethnicity participant choose match general population Dallas area . Spanish speaking subject eligible enrollment . No cultural ethnic background systematically exclude . The present study restrict subject overweight ( 25 &gt; BMI &lt; 35 ) . All subject normal nutritional status minimal ethanol intake ( &lt; 10 g/d ) . Because activity level know alter hepatic metabolism , subject choose participate regular exercise amount activity associate daily live . Participation concurrent study determine casebycase basis . Informed consent obtain participant . The investigator also enroll subject diagnose NAFLD Dr. Browning 's clinical hepatology practice . Based upon need study effect macronutrient manipulation variety condition , target enrollment protocol openended . This allow present application act basis study hepatic metabolism variety condition . The enrollment target 80 subject . In order eliminate confounding variable , participant choose stable health , medication know alter hepatic glucose metabolism , weight loss diet diet pill within previous 6 month , without baseline ketonuria . The present study restrict subject overweight ( 25 &gt; BMI &lt; 35 ) . Subjects history renal calculus , gout/hyperuricemia , renal insufficiency , also exclude study . Pregnant woman , child , institutionalize individual also exclude . NAFLD subject metal body exclude .</criteria>
