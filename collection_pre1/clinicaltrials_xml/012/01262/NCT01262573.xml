	<brief_summary>This study compare outcome among patient total laparoscopic hysterectomy . This involve remove uterus cervix use laparoscopic keyhole technique . The top vagina routinely suture closed procedure study compare two different suture material purpose . One suture material barb suture advantage maintain good tension closure wound . The standard smooth suture commonly use procedure . The investigator compare time take close vaginal cuff , well bleed surgery heal top vagina .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Barbed Suture v Smooth Suture Vaginal Cuff Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Barbed suture use close vaginal vault almost 3 year , preliminary study report positive outcome . Unfortunately , retrospective nature study may present outcome overly positive light , since patient may able remember potential complication problem may immediate postoperative period ( recall bias ) . The current standard care vaginal cuff closure appear use Vicryl suture although practice vary widely . The specific aim study evaluate whether use barb suture facilitates laparoscopic closure vaginal cuff total laparoscopic hysterectomy . The inclusion criterion study include patient plan total laparoscopic hysterectomy due benign condition symptomatic uterine fibroid , abnormal uterine bleeding , endometriosis pelvic pain . The laparoscopic hysterectomy proceed per routine . For vaginal cuff closure barb suture use 0 polydioxanone ( PDO ) bidirectional barb suture 36 mm half-circle taper point needle . For cuff closure Vicryl , plan use 2/0 Vicryl vaginal cuff closure proceed similar fashion barb suture . Regardless suture material use important obtain full thickness bite 1 cm margin vagina mucosa bite . Patients stratify either closure attend resident fellow supervision attend . The resident fellow 15 minute complete vaginal cuff closure . If able complete within time frame , attend take complete vaginal cuff closure . This avoid add excess operating time procedure due trainee perform portion procedure . Patients also ask complete short survey regard dyspareunia well standardize sexual function questionnaire ( FSFI ) prior surgery 3 month surgery evaluate use barb suture affect way . Further also inquire male dyspareunia surgery reason . Patients examine postoperative visit 3 week surgery vaginal cuff granulation evidence vaginal cuff infection separation carefully examine document . Patients call 3 month surgery inquire dyspareunia , male dyspareunia , vaginal bleeding readmission hospital . We interested evaluate dyspareunia , since concern raise use barbed suture vaginal apex may result dyspareunia partner dyspareunia . Although found case clinical experience would like evaluate point , especially since use barb suture close vaginal cuff become common practice nationwide . Patients dismiss trial 3 month follow .</detailed_description>
