	<brief_summary>In patient cancer also cancer cell abdominal cavity lung membrane . These cancer cell create much moisture abdominal cavity lung membrane . If fluid abdominal cavity ( ascites fluid ) bring abdominal distension , abdominal pain , loss appetite , fatigue , bloat sometimes wheeze . Too much fluid lung membrane ( call pleural fluid ) give breathlessness , chest pain coughing . The use diuretic may offer small group patient symptom reduction . Additionally , fluid drain needle puncture fluid collection ( biopsy ) . But usually , moisture quickly return . Previous research do hospital cediranib show patient cancer suffer fluid abdominal cavity lung membrane , moisture reduces use drug . It also reduce symptom cause excessive moisture . The current study conduct see whether patient cancer fluid abdominal cavity fluid lung blade benefit use cediranib . This involve whether amount moisture reduces , also complain decrease . In addition , carefully consider possible side effect cediranib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cediranib Palliative Treatment Patients With Symptomatic Malignant Ascites Pleural Effusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant ascites difficult clinical problem . Increasing intra-abdominal pressure result fluid accumulation may cause anorexia , sleep disturbance , pain , dyspnoea , abdominal distension , fatigue , nausea vomit reduce mobility . The main complaint pleural effusion dyspnoea cough . Paracentesis thoracentesis provide relief limited period . Studies show high concentration VEGF malignant ascites pleural effusion . Beneficial effect treatment intravenous intraperitoneal antibody VEGF malignant ascites report . In recent past treat two patient symptomatic malignant ascites ( colorectal cancer ovarian cancer , respectively ) phase I study cediranib . Shortly start cediranib , within couple day , ascites disappear . However , stop cediranib progressive disease sit ascites reappear within day . Therefore , one patient treat cediranib palliative treatment two day death , beneficial patient . In phase II study would like investigate effect treatment cediranib palliative treatment malignant ascites pleural effusion .</detailed_description>
