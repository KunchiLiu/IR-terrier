	<brief_title>Investigating Wrong-Patient Computerized Physician Order Entry ( CPOE ) Errors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Computerized Physician Order Entry ( CPOE ) system show prevent medical error , become major component patient safety movement . To accelerate adoption clinical information technology include CPOE system , American Recovery Reinvestment Act 2009 allocate approximately $ 17 billion incentive payment provider hospital implement health information technology . With increased adoption CPOE system , however , important recognize design flaw result creation new type iatrogenic medical error . In addition , CPOE system develop suboptimal onerous user interface contribute entire system reject physician . The ideal CPOE system maximize medical error reduction , minimize medical error creation , user friendly interface accept nurse , physician , pharmacist . An example new type iatrogenic medical error introduce CPOE system name `` juxtaposition error '' . Juxtaposition error , define Ash , et al . `` error result something close something else screen , wrong option easily click error . '' Juxtaposition error lead patient receive medication , test , treatment intend another patient , sometimes dire consequence . Juxtaposition error likely subclass broad group wrong-patient CPOE error multiple etiology . Other possible cause wrong-patient CPOE order include interruption error , double-interruption error . Primary Objectives : - Specific Aim 1 : Investigate prevalence wrong-patient near miss CPOE error . - Specific Aim 2 : Investigate root cause wrong-patient near miss CPOE error . - Specific Aim 3 : Investigate compare efficacy workflow impact two distinct intervention prevent wrong-patient near miss CPOE error control .</detailed_description>
