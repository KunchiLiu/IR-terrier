	<brief_summary>GERICO 09/0907 Phase II multicentric trial evaluate toxicity activity combination lapatinib capecitabine locally advance metastatic breast cancer express HER2 patient age ≥ 70 fail one line chemotherapy combination trastuzumab . Due minimal participation old people clinical trial , lack data make evidence-based decision regard chemotherapy indication . The study design investigate whether elderly patient locally advance metastatic breast cancer over-expressing HER2 could take advantage combination lapatinib capecitabine term clinical benefit , adverse effect detrimental impact functional status ( part geriatric assessment ) . The main objective ass clinical benefit ( defined 4 month complete response , partial response stable disease ) , safety preserve geriatric independence ( main objective `` bi-criteria '' composite criterion ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Lapatinib + Capecitabine Patients Aged 70 Over With HER2 Metastatic Breast Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More half patient breast cancer Her2-positive tumor treat trastuzumab single agent develop resistance within one year treatment initiation . Recent study population patient show use Capecitabine combine Lapatinib demonstrate improvement TTP without increase serious toxic effect . Our study design investigate whether elderly patient locally advance metastatic breast cancer over-expressing HER2 could take advantage combination lapatinib ( 1250mg/day ) capecitabine ( 1st cycle day 1 day 14 : 850mg/m2/day x2 ; next cycle day 1 day 14 : 1000 mg/m2/day x2 ) term clinical benefit , adverse effect detrimental impact functional status ( part geriatric assessment ) . Treatment continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity occurence . This phase II multicentric trial associate pharmacokinetic study aim assess effect age modification ( absorption , distribution , metabolism elimination ) combination Lapatinib-Capecitabine measure Cmin-Cmax component elderly patient .</detailed_description>
