	<brief_summary>This randomize , control , diagnostic , multicenter trial compare two diagnostic imaging pathway -- coronary compute tomography angiography ( CCTA ) single photon emission tomography ( SPECT ) myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) -- determine incidence major adverse coronary event ( MACE ) , define myocardial infarction ( MI ) cardiac-related death , cross-over revascularization . CCTA may use direct patient symptoms stable angina angina equivalent optimal medical therapy ( OMT ) . The use CCTA diagnostic tool angina symptom associated increase MACE revascularization , decrease cost , reduce risk ( e.g. , less radiation exposure ) , additional insight alternate explanation chest pain , increase cost-effectiveness comparison use SPECT MPI/invasive coronary angiography ( ICA ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Randomized Evaluation Patients Stable Angina Comparing Utilization Diagnostic Examinations ( RESCUE ) multi-center randomize , control trial respond need comparative analysis image technology role OMT clinical care . A total 4300 patient randomize CCTA SPECT MPI/ICA diagnostic assessment angina 80 institution internationally . This study build result COURAGE trial compare CCTA SPECT MPI/ICA integrate care paradigm feature initial treatment OMT patient diagnose CAD without significant disease leave main coronary artery . Participants follow composite endpoint MACE cross-over revascularization follow-up period two year ( two six time point depend diagnostic result time enrollment trial ) . The primary endpoint study combine endpoint occurrence MACE revascularization . We calculate difference combine MACE/revascularization endpoint CCTA SPECT MPI/ICA arm . Participant outcome assess age , gender , comorbidity , angina classification class presentation . Several comparative-effectiveness analysis perform . We hypothesize CCTA arm associate increase MACE revascularization , decrease cost , reduce risk ( e.g. , less radiation exposure ) , additional insight alternate explanation chest pain , increase cost-effectiveness comparison SPECT MPI/ICA . Findings expect result validation evolve new standard care patient stable angina take advantage CCTA OMT cost-effectively drive appropriate care reduce need invasive diagnosis increase radiation exposure SPECT MPI/ICA .</detailed_description>
