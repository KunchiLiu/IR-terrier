	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study side effect well intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) paclitaxel without pazopanib hydrochloride work treat patient anaplastic thyroid cancer . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether radiation therapy paclitaxel effective give pazopanib hydrochloride treat thyroid cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety IMRT , paclitaxel , pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) suspension . ( Run-in component ) II . To evaluate compare overall survival 1 year study registration . ( Phase II component ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate local-regional control 6 12 month . ( Phase II component ) II . To evaluate rate grade 4 ( Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4.0 [ CTCAE , v. 4.0 ] ) hemorrhage , grade 4 febrile neutropenia , grade 5 adverse event assess definitely , probably , possibly relate induction concurrent treatment component protocol regimen . ( Phase II component ) III . To evaluate rate adverse event ( CTCAE , v. 4.0 ) assess definitely , probably , possibly relate induction concurrent treatment component protocol regimen . ( Phase II component ) IV . To evaluate rate treatment discontinuation due toxicity induction concurrent treatment component protocol regimen . ( Phase II component ) V. To evaluate response ( per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] ) primary site follow treatment component subject measurable disease prior chemoradiation . ( Phase II component ) OUTLINE : RUN-IN COMPONENT : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour weekly pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 2-3 week . Patients receive concurrent paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD 6-7 week ( radiation treatment complete ) intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) 5 day per week 6.5 week ( total 66 Gy 33 fraction ) . Beginning 25-31 day completion IMRT , patient receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course ( patient measurable disease ) continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( patient measurable disease ) . RANDOMIZED PHASE II COMPONENT : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD 2-3 week . Patients receive concurrent paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD 6-7 week ( radiation treatment complete ) IMRT 5 day per week 6.5 week ( total 66 Gy 33 fraction ) . Beginning 25-31 day completion IMRT , patient receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly pazopanib hydrochloride PO QD . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course ( patient measurable disease ) continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( patient measurable disease ) . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly placebo PO QD 2-3 week . Patients receive concurrent paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly placebo PO QD 6-7 week ( radiation treatment complete ) IMRT 5 day per week 6.5 week ( total 66 Gy 33 fraction ) . Beginning 25-31 day completion IMRT , patient receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly placebo PO QD . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course ( patient measurable disease ) continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( patient measurable disease ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
