	<brief_title>Low Back Study Compare Traditional Physical Therapy With Combined Therapy Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients place randomly control group receive 10 week standard physical therapy study group receive equivalent 10 week therapy utilizing vibration , unweighting , therapeutic exercise manual mobilization . The study use baseline MRI x-ray show justification surgical intervention course protocol repeat MRI 's x-rays determine statistical change lumbar spine result reduction elimination pain , improve range motion , improvement performance reduction elimination need surgical intervention . Anatomical measure do compare pre-treatment versus post-treatment include foraminal dimension , disc height , canal stenosis , lumbosacral angle facet space . Questionnaires complete course treatment post-treatment 6 month one year . The final follow phone call patient make follow 24 month post initial treatment determine current patient status pertain low back pain , subsequent treatment , surgery , etc . Final study documentation occur time . Intermediate result one year compare control group vs. study group overall result difference .</detailed_description>
