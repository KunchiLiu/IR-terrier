	<detailed_description>Preterm infant ( PI ) predispose loss heat little subcutaneous tissue high ratio surface body weight reduced amount glycogen deposit brown fat ( Gomella , 2005 , p. 43 ) . In Mexico South America 2003 report 207.753 neonatal death , 21.4 per every 1,000 bear alive hypothermia significant among infant low birth weight preterm infant . ( Zuleta , Gomez &amp; Jaramillo , 2009 ) . PRETERM INFANT Official Mexican Norm -007-SSA2-1993 ( 1995 ) considers preterm infant product conception 28-37 week gestation , weigh 1000-2499 g. THERMOREGULATION OF PRETERM INFANT Survival newborn increase excessive loss heat prevent . To achieve purpose newborn keep thermal environment neutral `` allow infant consume least amount energy maintain normal body temperature '' . ( Karlsen , 2006 , p. 49 ) The heat gain lose convection 37 % ( child fluid : air stream bathing ) , conduction 4 % ( two body contact different temperature : field , mattress ) radiation , 43 % ( two solid surface touch : cool wall incubator ) 16 % evaporation ( heat loss conversion water liquid gas , skin , breathing , sweat ) . ( Tamez &amp; Pantoja , 2004 , pp . 29-30 ; Ru√≠z , 2007 ) The understanding form heat exchange provide scientific basis nursing intervention aim modify environment . Response cold stress preterm infant : When sensor central peripheral temperature detect stress cold , send signal hypothalamus . The hypothalamus activate liberation norepinephrine . This hormone cause increment metabolism , increase oxygen consumption glucose utilization . The increment consumption oxygen induce hypoxemia severe , could progress hypoxia . Peripheral vasoconstriction limit infant low birth weight first 48 hour life ; increase heat loss level skin . In preterm infant loss heat occur fast ability produce conserve heat . ( Karlsen , 2006 , p. 56 ) Adverse effect cold stress term preterm neonate : When term preterm neonate hypothermic , metabolism , oxygen consumption glucose utilization increase . If neonate , experience trouble breath , able confront increment demand oxygen tissue . This allow increase hypoxemia , contributes increase pulmonary vasoconstriction . The severe hypoxemia progress hypoxia , lead anaerobic metabolism . During anaerobic metabolism , accumulation lactic acid blood ph drop observe . If reverse , risk death high . ( Jasso , 2005 , p. 91 ; Karlsen , 2006 , p. 58 ) The hypothermia cause hypoglycemia , since glucose primary source energy brain . The level conscience neonate diminish , respiration become slow oxygenation affect . The survivor event hypothermia collateral effect increase difficulty respiration , severe renal failure , disseminate coagulation , increase incidence infection persistence arterial conduit . ( Karlsen , 2006 , p. 58 ) PLACEMENT OF POLYETHYLENE BAG The program STABLE ( sugar , temperature , airway , blood pressure , lab work emotional support ) care post-resuscitation pre-transport sick neonate , recommend cover premature infant plastic cover immediately birth , neck reduce heat loss evaporation convection . ( Karlsen , 2006 , pp . 51 , 53 ) The polyethylene bag , `` cheap device , practical , simple , interfere immediate care resuscitation ( Vohra et al. , 2004 ) put risk integrity security newborn . But clear whether effectiveness similar without prior dry newborn , study compare two technique conduct term infant randomize ( Menesses et al. , 2002 ) . It recommend apnea birth treat secondary apnea delay resuscitation . ( American Academy Pediatrics American Heart Association , 2000 ) At stage every second vital newborn , come concern know polyethylene bag equally effective thermoregulation newborn , without pre-drying , since would save second dry , immediately begin neonatal resuscitation .</detailed_description>
