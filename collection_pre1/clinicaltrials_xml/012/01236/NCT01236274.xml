	<brief_summary>A number study suggest association use antipsychotic agent cardiovascular mortality . However , relationship cardiac event use antipsychotic drug clear . Patients experience psychosis need antipsychotic agent may high risk cardiac event regardless effect antipsychotic medication . Two study specifically investigate association use antipsychotic risk cardiac event use Myocardial Infarction ( MI ) outcome measure , report association positive association respectively . This difference result may explain use different measure well study design study different limitation regard control lifestyle medical risk factor . This study aim assess relationship risk MI recent exposure antipsychotic agent use self-controlled case series method able control fix confounders . The result self-controlled case series method compare result case-control study use data compare estimate method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Risk Myocardial Infarction Users Antipsychotic Agents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study part CALIBER ( Cardiovascular disease research use link bespoke study electronic record ) programme fund 5 year NIHR Wellcome Trust . The central theme CALIBER research linkage Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project ( MINAP ) primary care ( GPRD ) resource . The overarch aim CALIBER good understand aetiology prognosis specific coronary phenotype across range causal domain , particularly electronic record provide contribution beyond traditional study . CALIBER receive Ethics approval ( ref 09/H0810/16 ) ECC approval ( ref ECC 2-06 ( b ) /2009 CALIBER dataset ) . The use antipsychotic associate rise cardiovascular event . Previous study investigate effect antipsychotic agent risk Myocardial Infarction ( MI ) lead conflict result report either association positive association . As patient population antipsychotic agent indicate differ considerably healthy comparison population , confound indication could substantial . Whilst confound account know measure , residual confounding remain potential problem . This study aim assess relationship risk MI recent exposure antipsychotic agent use self-controlled case series method able control fix confounders . The result self-controlled case series method compare result case-control study use data explore role confound indication .</detailed_description>
