	<brief_summary>Malaria one major infectious disease world tremendous impact quality life significantly contribute ongoing poverty endemic country . It cause almost one million death per year , majority child age five . The malaria parasite enters human body skin , bite infected mosquito . Subsequently , invades liver develop multiplies inside hepatocytes . After week , hepatocytes burst open parasite release blood stream , cause clinical phase disease . As unique opportunity study malaria immunology efficacy immunisation strategy , protocol develop past conduct experimental human malaria infection ( EHMIs ) . EHMIs generally involve small group malaria-naïve volunteer infect via bite P. falciparum infect laboratory-reared Anopheline mosquito . Although potentially serious even lethal , Plasmodium falciparum ( P.falciparum ) malaria radically cure early stage blood infection risk complication virtually absent . The investigator show previously , healthy human volunteer protect malaria mosquito challenge immunization mosquito-bites chloroquine prophylaxis ( CPS immunization ) . However , unknown whether protection base immunity direct towards liver- blood stage disease . For future development vaccine understand protective immunity malaria , important investigate level protective immunity generate CPS immunization . Therefore , aim investigate whether CPS immunization confers protection blood-stage challenge .</brief_summary>
