	<brief_summary>The AML18 Pilot Trial evaluate feasibility three intervention plan include forthcoming NCRI AML18 Trial . One intervention evaluate combine Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor AC220 three course standard DAE ( Daunorubicin , Ara-C , Etoposide ) . AC220 give follow treatment course , daily mouth 7 , 14 21 day . AC220 evaluate 3 dose level 60 , 90 135 mg flat dose . A 4th dose level 40 mg introduce patient respond well 60 mg . The second intervention test combination CXCR4 inhibitor Plerixafor three course chemotherapy combination DClo ( Daunorubicin , Clofarabine ) . Patients/investigators able choose intervention enter . Depending recruitment requirement , one intervention might available one time . The third intervention Patients receive 3 treatment 100 mg ganetespib day 1 , 8 15 course day 1 first day chemotherapy . The chemotherapy DAE/DAE/DA . Three course chemotherapy give associated 3 administration ganetespib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Establish Feasibility Combining Either Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor AC220 , CXCR4 Inhibitor Plerixafor HSP90 Inhibitor Ganetespib With Chemotherapy Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukaemia High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The AML18 Pilot Trial available patient primary secondary AML define WHO Classification ( Appendix A ) ( exclude Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia ) , high risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( i.e . &gt; 10 % marrow blast ) consider suitable current NCRI trial younger patient ( MRC AML 17 ) . This trial primary aim assess feasibility three treatment plan forthcoming NCRI AML18 Trial . The first feasibility add AC220 , give sequentially initially 7 day , three course standard chemotherapy . AC220 assess three daily dose level : - 60mg/day , 90mg/day , 135 mg/day also , require , 40mg/day . The protocol also assess separate study cohort feasibility combine CXCR4 inhibitor , Plerixafor , fix dose combination three course chemotherapy . The third intervention patient receive 3 treatment ganetespib day 1 , 8 15 course day 1 first day chemotherapy . The chemotherapy DAE/DAE/DA . Three course chemotherapy give associated 3 administration ganetespib . THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS Therapeutic Interventions AC220 Assessment : Patients enter one 3 dose level cohort either 60mg/day , 90mg/day 135mg/day provision ass 40mg/day require . Each cohort receive three course chemotherapy approximately 4 5 week apart , comprise DAE ( Daunorubicin , Ara-C , Etoposide ) 10 day ( Course 1 ) , DAE 8 day ( Course 2 ) DA ( Daunorubicin , Ara-C ) 5 day ( Course 3 ) . Two day last day chemotherapy patient receive AC220 orally , daily 7 consecutive day . Formal safety pharmaco-kinetic assessment undertaken day 1 , 7 14 course AC220 , interim toxicity also require report . Sufficient patient must enter AC220 dose level cohort ensure least 3 patient evaluable three course . Cohort 2 ( i.e.60mg/day 14 day ) open recruitment minimum 3 evaluable patient complete course 1 . Cohort 3 ( 40mg/day dose level either 7/14 day ) undertake cohort 1 2 unsuccessful i.e . fail satisfy safety criterion . It anticipate 'study dose ' establish experience cohorts 1 5 . Cohort 6 ( 'study dose ' ) receive AC220 21 day chemotherapy course . In cohort must minimum 10 day break end AC220 course start subsequent chemotherapy course . Therapeutic Interventions Plerixafor Assessment : The aim ass feasibility combine fix dose ( 240mcg/kg ) Plerixafor give day chemotherapy 3 course , combine G-CSF course 2 3 . The three chemotherapy course Daunorubicin/Clofarabine ( DClo ) course 1 &amp; 2 Daunorubicin/Ara-C ( DA ) course 3 . Each course last 5 day Plerixafor give 5 day . Cohort 1 receive three course chemotherapy Plerixafor course 1 . Cohort 2 receive three course Plerixafor course 1 2 . Cohort 3 receive chemotherapy Plerixafor three course . Cohort 4 cohort 3 also receive G-CSF course 2 3 . Therapeutic Interventions Ganetespib Assessment : There one feasibility cohort 10 evaluable patient require evaluable 30 day first course , day 1 first day chemotherapy . Patients receive 3 treatment ganetespib day 1 , 8 15 course day 1 first day chemotherapy . The chemotherapy DAE/DAE/DA . Three course chemotherapy give associated 3 administration ganetespib .</detailed_description>
