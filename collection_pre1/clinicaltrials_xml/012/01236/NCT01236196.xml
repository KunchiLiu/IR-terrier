Secondary Aim : determine moderator mediate factor telephone CBT facilitate pain management successful adjustment OEF/OIF/OND veterans chronic pain . Major hypothesis : Hypothesis 1 : Patients receive telephone CBT show significantly great improvement cop skill , reduce emotional distress , increase quality life compare participate telephone pain education ( EDU ) . Hypothesis 2 : The dropout rate telephone intervention study significantly low attrition rate find previous study face-to-face CBT chronic pain . Secondary hypothesis : Hypothesis 3 : An increase use cop skill positively associate treatment outcome measure reflect improve adjustment chronic pain . Hypothesis 4 : A decrease catastrophizing positively associate treatment outcome measure reflect improve adjustment chronic pain . To accomplish aim , conduct randomized clinical trial compare telephone-delivered cognitive behavior therapy pain education control . A total 42 OEF/OIF/OND veteran chronic pain enrol study randomize one two treatment condition .
