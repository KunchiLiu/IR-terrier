	<brief_title>High-dose Cyclophosphamide Moderate Severe Refractory Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic inflammatory demyelinate polyneuropathy ( CIDP ) common under-recognized peripheral neuropathy think immune-mediated . Randomized , placebo control clinical trial CIDP demonstrate benefit treatment corticosteroid , plasmapheresis , IV Ig . However , patient respond therapy . IV cyclophosphamide , cyclosporine , interferon , total lymphoid irradiation , mycophenolate mofetil propose appropriate therapy refractory patient . Patients CIDP often respond immune-modulating treatment . However , high rate relapse treatment-related side effect result poor long-term outcome many patient . CIDP assume autoimmune disease , pathogenesis poorly understood . T cell infiltrate predominantly CD8 , suggest T cell mediate process . There , however , restrict T cell receptor Vbeta utilization see sural nerve biopsy . Immunoglobulin complement deposit note myelin sheaths support antibody-mediated process . Antibodies P0 myelin protein see minority patient . High-dose cyclophosphamide believe eradicate B T lymphocytes . This therapy damage hematopoietic stem cell , allow rapid white cell recovery without stem cell rescue .</detailed_description>
