	<brief_summary>Background : - One experimental treatment certain type cancer cell therapy , involve collect lymphocyte ( white blood cell ) tumor , grow laboratory large number , modify cell gene ( interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) ) stimulate immune system attack destroy cancer cell . Because treatment experimental , researcher interested determine side effect overall effectiveness cell therapy use white blood cell modify IL-12 treatment aggressive cancer . Objectives : - To determine safety effectiveness cell therapy use IL-12 modified tumor white blood cell treat metastatic melanoma . Eligibility : - Individuals great equal 18 year age less equal age 66 diagnose metastatic melanoma . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , image study . - Cells treatment collect tumor biopsy surgery . - Prior start cell therapy , participant image procedure , heart lung function test , blood urine test , well leukapheresis collect additional white blood cell . - For 5 day cell infusion , participant admit inpatient chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludarabine suppress immune system preparation cell therapy . - Participants receive modify white blood cell infusion 1 4 day last dose chemotherapy . The day infusion , participant receive filgrastim stimulate blood cell growth . - Participants remain inpatient least 5 10 day recover treatment , follow regularly treatment study side effect general effectiveness . - Participants initially respond treatment relapse may one additional treatment use procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cell Therapy Metastatic Melanoma Using CD8 Enriched Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) important immunostimulatory cytokine . We construct retroviral vector contain inducible single chain IL-12 driven nuclear factor activate T-cells ( NFAT ) responsive promoter use mediate transfer gene anti-tumor lymphocyte . This construct enable secretion IL-12 follow stimulation T cell receptor . - Transduction IL-12 gene mouse anti-tumor lymphocyte result profound increase ability lymphocytes mediate tumor regression follow administration tumor bear mouse . These cell profound advantage induce anti-tumor response cell need requirement concomitant administration interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) case conventional cell transfer immunotherapy . - Based murine study construct similar retrovirus contains inducible human single chain IL-12 driven NFAT responsive promoter . This retrovirus use transduce tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) suitable therapy patient metastatic melanoma . Objectives : Primary objective : - To evaluate safety administration IL-12 engineer TIL patient receive non-myeloablative conditioning regimen . - Determine administration IL-12 engineer TIL patient follow non-myeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic cancer . Secondary objective : -Determine vivo survival IL-12 gene-engineered cell . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old must : - metastatic melanoma ; - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 ; Design : - TIL resect metastatic deposit grow IL-2 use standard technique . - Prior approval amendment A , 2 week TIL undergo cluster differentiation 8 ( CD8 ) enrichment Miltenyi column undergo rapid expansion exposure Muromoanb-CD3 ) OKT-3 IL-2 presence irradiate feeder cell . Four five day later , transduction initiate addition retroviral vector supernatant contain IL-12 gene . With approval amendment A , TIL undergo CD8 enrichment . Starting cohort 5 , initial growth , TIL undergo rapid expansion exposure OKT-3 IL-2 presence irradiate feeder cell . Four five day later , transduction initiate addition retroviral vector supernatant contain IL-12 gene . - Patients receive nonmyeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow intravenous infusion IL-12 gene-transduced TIL . Cohorts 3 patient receive increase cell dos . - Patients undergo complete evaluation tumor physical examination , compute tomography ( CT ) chest , abdomen pelvis clinical laboratory evaluation four six week treatment . If patient stable disease ( SD ) tumor shrinkage , repeat complete evaluation perform every 1-3 month . After first year , patient continue respond continue follow evaluation every 3-4 month study criterion meet . - The study conduct use Phase I/II optimal design . The protocol proceed phase 1 dose escalation design . - Prior approval amendment A , protocol enrol 1 patient first 3 dose cohort . Cohort 4 proceed phase 1 dose escalation design , n=3 . Should single patient experience dose limit toxicity due cell transfer particular dose level , additional patient would treat dose confirm great 1/6 patient dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) prior proceed next high level . If level 2 DLTs 3-6 patient identify , three additional patient accrue next- lowest dose , total 6 , order characterize safety maximum tolerate dose . - With approval amendment A , additional patient enrol cohort 4 , protocol enroll 1 patient cohort 5 dose 1 X 10^7 bulk young TIL cell . Cohorts 6-12 proceed phase 1 dose escalation design , n=3 . Should single patient experience dose limit toxicity due cell transfer particular dose level , additional patient would treat dose confirm great 1/6 patient DLT prior proceed next high level . If level 2 DLTs 3-6 patient identify , three additional patient accrue next-lowest dose , total 6 , order characterize safety maximum tolerate dose prior start pahse II portion . If dose limit toxicity occur cohort 4 , cohort expand 6 patient . If 2 DLTs encounter cohort , study terminate . - Once maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine , study would proceed phase II portion use phase II optimal design initially 21 evaluable patient enrol . If 0 1 21 patient experience clinical response , patient enrol 2 first 21 evaluable patient enrol clinical response , accrual continue total 41 evaluable patient enrol . - The objective determine combination lymphocyte deplete chemotherapy , IL-12 gene engineer lymphocyte associate clinical response rate rule 5 % ( p0=0.05 ) favor modest 20 % partial response ( PR ) + complete response ( CR ) rate ( p1=0.20 ) .</detailed_description>
