	<brief_title>Discontinuation Orthokeratology Eyeball Elongation Myopic Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children wear ortho-k show slow rate myopic progression wear single-vision spectacle ( Cho et al . 2005 ) soft lens ( Walline et al . 2009 ) . Both study show effect myopic control significant first six month treatment . It unknown whether myopic control effect would dissipate upon discontinuation treatment whether myopic control effect happen first six month lens wear maintain thereafter . The current study aim evaluate effect discontinuation ortho-k treatment myopic control child currently treatment . This knowledge necessary important patients/parents concern permanent dependency ortho-k enrol treatment . Children treatment two year recently complete myopic control study The Hong Kong Polytechnic University , i.e . ROMIO , TO-SEE HM-PRO study , invited participate 14-month study . Ortho-k subject randomly assign study group ortho-k control group . The study group subject require stop lens wear 7 month completion previous study ( Phase I ) resume lens wear next 7 month ( Phase II ) . The ortho-k control group subject require continue current treatment another 14 month . Control subject exist myopic control study require continue use treatment , i.e . single-vision glass , another 14 month . Rate myopic progression among 3 group two study phase determine compare .</detailed_description>
