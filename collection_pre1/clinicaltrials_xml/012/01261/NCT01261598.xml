	<brief_summary>The poor prognosis early-stage lung cancer due potential worsening disease ( local relapse , metastasis ) , insufficient efficacy toxicity actual treatment . FDG-PET medical imaging modality allow quantification tumour glucose consumption . Then , exam use pathology staging , target volume definition RT , treatment efficiency month RT CRT . Our assumption FDG-PET exam course RT CRT might predictive treatment efficiency month later . In study , investigator propose perform 4 FDG-PET : first `` PET1 '' radiotherapy , second `` PET2 '' radiotherapy ( see RTEP1 ) , third fourth `` PET3 '' `` PET4 '' 3month 12 month therapy . The investigator investigate performance FDG-PET perform RT CRT prediction one-year patient heath outcome . If predictive value TEP2 confirm , investigator would able optimize plan treatment course therapy .</brief_summary>
