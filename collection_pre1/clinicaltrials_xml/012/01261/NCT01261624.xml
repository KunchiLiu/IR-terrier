	<brief_summary>The present study design order evaluate efficacy safety two dos Givinostat subject polyarticular course JIA Givinostat ready-to-use suspension especially intend paediatric administration , administer orally different daily dos . Patients establish diagnosis one follow JIA form ( Polyarticular JIA rheumatoid factor positive negative , Oligoarticular extend JIA , Systemic JIA without active systemic feature ) enrol . The treatment regimen remain unchanged 12 week clinical response assess apply ACR Pediatric response criterion . Patients achieve least ACR Pediatric 30 response continue receive assign dose 12 week . After end study ( week 24 ) responder patient allow extend treatment maintain clinical benefit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Non-clinical data Givinostat , support potent anti-inflammatory mechanism action potentially slow arthritic destructive process . This rationale seem confirm preliminary evidence collect previous Phase II clinical trial conduct child young adult systemic JIA . The present protocol aim collect new information safety efficacy two dos Givinostat treatment JIA .</detailed_description>
