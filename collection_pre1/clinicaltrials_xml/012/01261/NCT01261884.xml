	<brief_summary>Preeclampsia high blood pressure disorder pregnancy significant cause maternal fetal complication pregnancy . To date , know `` cure '' preeclampsia , study show exercise may lower risk preeclampsia high blood pressure disorder pregnancy . Resistance training also lower blood pressure , may easier perform pregnant population , lead high compliance . The investigator propose perform novel prospective study resistance train regimen blood pressure pregnant patient high risk develop preeclampsia high blood pressure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Pregnancy Reduction Blood Pressure Obese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension affect 5-10 percent pregnancy , complication hypertensive disorder pregnancy third lead cause maternal death United States . Hypertensive disorder pregnancy , include preeclampsia , lead preterm delivery , morbidity mortality mother , fetus , neonate , predictor development chronic maternal hypertension , cardiovascular disease , renal disease . Maternal obesity increase dramatically patient population , independent risk factor hypertension preeclampsia , increase risk two- four-fold . To date , effective preventative measure find reduce risk preeclampsia hypertension high risk pregnant patient . However , observational study show patient exercise increased physical activity pregnancy low rate preeclampsia , hypertension , gestational diabetes . Exercise show numerous study safe pregnancy , recommend American College Obstetrics Gynecology part routine prenatal care . However , aerobic exercise view patient difficult perform pregnancy , particularly patient obese late gestation . Adherence exercise regimens therefore low patient group . Dynamic resistance train show low mean blood pressure acutely long term non-pregnant hypertensive patient , perform easily patient mobility issue . This intervention study obese pregnant population effect blood pressure throughout pregnancy . The long term goal develop intervention reduce barrier exercise obese pregnant woman , turn , reduce risk develop preeclampsia hypertensive disorder pregnancy . The specific objective proposal study effect structure resistance training exercise intervention blood pressure obese pregnant woman , would consider high risk development hypertensive disorder base pre-pregnancy BMI . The central hypothesis obese pregnant patient participate regular , structure resistance training exercise regimen decrease mean arterial blood pressure compare obese pregnant patient strongly encourage aerobic exercise ( lifestyle intervention ) participate routine prenatal care . The investigator formulate hypothesis , part , base upon previous study find literature perform non-pregnant hypertensive patient . The investigator extrapolate experience method collaborator , study effect exercise gestational diabetes .</detailed_description>
