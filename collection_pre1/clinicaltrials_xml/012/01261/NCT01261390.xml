	<brief_summary>Moderate severe sleep apnea ( high number breathing pause sleep study ) common health problem often associate loud snore sleepiness.The medical term problem obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . People OSA often increase risk develop heart disease may already diagnosis heart disease . A clinical research study conduct Brigham Women 's Hospital Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center compare effect continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) conservative medical therapy participation one four group : - CPAP Therapy Group : Standard medical treatment sleep apnea , CPAP mask worn sleep . Participants randomize either Respiratory Therapist ( RT ) RT Cognitive Behavioral Therapist . - Alternative CPAP Group : Different air delivery level mask CPAP Therapy Group . RT meeting . - Conventional Medical Therapy ( CMT ) Group : Receive one year supply nasal strip follow guideline change sleep habit minimize apnea.Frequent follow-up support research coordinator . A sleep doctor cardiologist indicate potential participant appropriate candidate receive CPAP CMT acceptable approach treat his/her sleep apnea . Participants recruit age 45-75 year diagnosed heart disease 55-75 year risk factor develop heart disease . This 12 month study* evaluate alternative way address potential OSA treatment reduce heart disease identify feature would strengthen later , large-scale randomize controlled trial . *For randomized December 31 , 2012 , study 6 month long . We test hypothesis active treatment OSA CPAP reduce CVD morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In pilot randomize control trial , assess effectiveness CPAP therapy reduce burden cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) CVD risk factor patient moderate severe obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) present sleep disorder clinic . A total 700 patient new diagnosis moderate severe OSA recruit BWH-affiliated sleep disorder clinic , BWH , MGH , Faulkner Hospital Cardiology Clinics ( similar specialize clinic see patient cardiovascular risk factor , endocrinology hypertensive clinic ) , Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Joslin Diabetes Center . After complete 2 week run-in period , randomized participant ( approximately 150 participant randomize ) undergo baseline 6 month assessment key study exposure outcome variable . Participants randomized completion Baseline visit . The treatment arm follow : The active group : - Active CPAP treatment deliver use standard respiratory therapist ( RT ) adherence education support - Active CPAP treatment administer use adherence education support deliver RT enhance behavioral promotion intervention The control arm : - Sham-CPAP - CMT , alone Participants randomize December 31 , 2012 ( n=108 ) also undergo 12 month follow-up assessment . Participants offer 12 month supervise conservative medical therapy ( CMT ) program OSA duration study intervention . Subjects would contact bimonthly interval alternate phone office visit assess safety , identify adverse event , identify health care utilization , reinforce protocol adherence . At 6 12 month , study outcome reassess collect data source . Patients randomize December 31 , 2012 undergo 6 month follow-up assessment . Participants offer 6 month supervise conservative medical therapy ( CMT ) program OSA duration study intervention . Subjects would contact bimonthly interval alternate phone office visit assess safety , identify adverse event , identify health care utilization , reinforce protocol adherence . At 6 month , study outcome reassess collect data source .</detailed_description>
