	<brief_title>Cardiac Hemodynamics Overlap Syndrome ( COPD With Obstructive Sleep Apnea )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Presence chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) patient term overlap syndrome , affect 1 % U.S. population . Despite high prevalence overlap syndrome , little research do field . Overlap syndrome recently report high death rate COPD alone , due effect heart . However , mechanism overlap syndrome affect heart know well . Also , ideal treatment overlap syndrome know . This study do find mechanisms overlap syndrome affect right leave side heart ( use cardiac MRI study heart ) . We also compare effect treatment bi-level positive airway pressure device ( BPAP ) vs. night-time oxygen heart overlap syndrome . These aim allow u test hypothesis overlap syndrome patient bad heart function COPD OSA , treatment BPAP device improve heart function well oxygen . At baseline visit , subject undergo overnight sleep study hospital . In morning , blood draw measure serum inflammatory biomarkers ( C-Reactive Protein , interleukin-6 , P-selectin , ICAM-1 , TNF-alpha ) , urine catecholamine level , six-minute walk test , questionnaire health-related quality life score modify Medical Research Council ( MMRC ) dyspnea score , lung function test , ultrasound forearm blood vessel cardiac MRI do . No follow-up visit need subject sleep apnea . If subject sleep apnea base sleep study , he/she allot treatment BPAP device night-time oxygen 6 month . If subject want treat BPAP oxygen , CPAP device use treat sleep apnea . During duration study treatment , phone call brief study visit 3 month do make sure discomfort relate treatment . After 6 month study treatment , cardiac MRI , ultrasound forearm blood vessel , lung function test , blood draw serum inflammatory biomarkers , urine catecholamine level , six-minute walk test , questionnaires dyspnea score quality life score repeat . This study help u well understand mechanisms high death rate due effect heart overlap syndrome . It also help u understanding good way treat sleep apnea COPD patient .</detailed_description>
