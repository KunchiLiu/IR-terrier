	<brief_summary>Patients severe ischemic hemorrhagic stroke , require mechanical ventilation , particularly bad prognosis . If require long-term ventilation , orotracheal tube need , like intensive care patient , replace short tracheal tube larynx . This call tracheostomy might associate advantage less demand narcotic pain killer , less lesion mouth larynx , good mouth hygiene , safe airway , patient comfort early mobilisation . The best timepoint tracheostomy stroke , however , know . This study investigate potential benefit early tracheostomy ventilate critically ill patient ischemic hemorrhagic stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Tracheostomy Ventilated Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Tracheostomy common procedure critical care patient . Advantages short tracheal tube compare long orotracheal one avoidance laryngeal lesion sinusitis , facilitation nursing care physiotherapy reduction analgosedatives . The optimal point time tracheostomy still unknown , commonly do later 2-3 week one several fail extubation trial . Studies different set critical care patient suggest additional advantage early tracheostomy : le pneumonias complication , patient comfort , less analgosedation , short duration ventilation ICU stay . These question look non-traumatic neurocritical care patient , although might special wean benefit early tracheostomy , mainly compromise secure airway , breathe . Method : Non-traumatic Neurocritical care patient ischemic stroke , intracerebral hemorrhage subarachnoid hemorrhage severly affect 2 week ventilation need estimate , principally eligible study . After randomization , one group receive tracheostomy within first 3 day intubation . The group stay orotracheally intubate either wean extubated receives tracheostomy within 7 14 day intubation . Tracheostomy do percutaneous dilatation neurologist .</detailed_description>
