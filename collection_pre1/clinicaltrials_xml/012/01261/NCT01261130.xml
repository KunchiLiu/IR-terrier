	<detailed_description>Human hookworm infection soil-transmitted helminth infection cause nematode parasite Necator americanus Ancylostoma duodenale . It one common chronic infection human , afflict 740 million people develop nation tropic . The large number case occur impoverished rural area sub-Saharan Africa , Southeast Asia , China , tropical region Americas . Approximately 3.2 billion people risk hookworm infection area . N. americanus common hookworm worldwide , whereas A. duodenale geographically restrict . The primary approach hookworm control worldwide frequent periodic mass administration benzimidazole anthelminthic school-aged child live high-prevalence area . In 2001 , World Health Assembly adopt Resolution 54.19 urge member state provide regular anthelminthic treatment high-risk group target regular treatment least 75 % at-risk school-aged child . However , cure rate single dose benzimidazole varies rate low 61 % ( 400 mg ) 67 % ( 800 mg ) albendazole 19 % ( single dose ) 45 % ( repeat dose ) mebendazole report . These concern prompt interest develop alternative tool hookworm control . Vaccination prevent anemia associate moderate heavy intensity hookworm infection would alleviate public health deficiency drug treatment alone . The current strategy development Human Hookworm candidate vaccine focus antigen express adult stage hookworm life cycle play role digest host hemoglobin , use worm energy source . These antigen relatively hidden human immune system natural infection , hence low likelihood induce antigen-specific IgE exposed/infected individual , reduce potential allergic reaction upon vaccination . The nutritional metabolic requirement adult hookworm living human intestine dependent upon degradation host hemoglobin ingest worm . N. americanus hookworm depend host hemoglobin survival . Following hemolysis , adult hookworm use order cascade hemoglobinases cleave hemoglobin small molecule . Following hemoglobin digestion , free heme generates toxic oxygen radical bind detoxified molecule glutathione S-transferase-1 ( GST-1 ) . GST-1 N. americanus ( Na-GST-1 ) critical enzyme play role parasite blood feeding ; use vaccine , investigator hypothesize antigen induce anti-enzyme neutralizing antibody interfere parasite blood-feeding cause parasite death reduce worm fecundity . Following selection candidate antigen Na-GST-1 successfully manufacture tested laboratory animal Alhydrogel® ( aluminum hydroxide suspension ) Alhydrogel® plus Gluco-Pyranosylphospho-Lipid A Aqueous Formulation ( GLA-AF ) . Na-GST-1 show pure , potent , stable administer either two formulation . The Na-GST-1 vaccine formulation test study consist 24 kDa recombinant protein Na-GST-1 adsorb Alhydrogel® either without addition GLA-AF . For Na-GST-1/GLA-AF formulation , GLA-AF add Alhydrogel® formulation immediately prior immunization . The active ingredient vaccine formulation recombinant Na-GST-1 protein derive fermentation Pichia pastoris yeast cell genetically engineer express Na-GST-1 . In first-in-human study , evaluation safety immunogenicity Na-GST-1 Na-GST-1/GLA-AF formulation conduct two part . First , healthy adult infect exposed hookworm enrol urban center Belo Horizonte , Brazil . Hookworm Brazil primarily rural disease uncommon develop urban area Belo Horizonte . If significant safety concern observe volunteer , study proceed enroll vaccinate healthy adult hookworm-endemic region state Minas Gerais , Brazil . The vaccine formulation test population ( i.e. , non-endemic endemic area ) , give possibility safety profile vaccine formulation may different population chronically expose antigen contain vaccine . In Part I study , 36 volunteer enrol one six cohort . In first cohort , 6 individual receive 10 µg dose Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® ; second cohort , 6 individual receive 10 µg dose Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel®/GLA-AF ; third fourth cohort , 6 volunteer receive 30 µg Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel®/GLA-AF , respectively ; fifth sixth cohort , 6 volunteer receive 100 µg Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel®/GLA-AF , respectively . Enrollment cohort stagger one-week interval : Cohorts 2 3 enrol begin vaccination 1 week Cohort 1 , Cohorts 4 5 vaccinate 1 week Cohorts 2 3 , Cohort 6 vaccinate 1 week Cohorts 4 5 . In Part II study , 66 volunteer progressively enrol one six dose cohort . In first , third fifth cohort , volunteer randomize receive either Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® ( n=8 ) Butang® ( n=2 ) , second , fourth sixth cohort , volunteer randomize receive either Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® ( n=2 ) Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel®/GLA-AF ( n=10 ) . Volunteers randomize receive Na-GST-1 receive either 10 µg , 30 µg 100 µg dose . In order ensure vaccine formulation evaluate individual recently infect hookworm , least 4 individual enrol Part II chohorts infect hookworm base fecal exam conduct screen study , document infection within 3 month date plan first vaccination participant . The investigator choose Butang® hepatitis B vaccine ( Instituto Butantan , Sao Paulo , Brazil ) comparator vaccine five principal reason : ( 1 ) likely confer benefit participant receive , ( 2 ) establish safety record , ( 3 ) yeast-derived recombinant protein adsorb aluminum-containing immunostimulant , ( 4 ) physical appearance Na-GST-1 immunostimulanted Alhydrogel , ( 5 ) dosing schedule permit easy incorporation study design . Furthermore , Butang® widely-used hepatitis B vaccine Brazil , 15 million dos distribute annually . Each participant recieve 3 dos assign study agent give 56 day interval ( i.e . Day 0 , Day 56 Day 112 ) . The trial expect last total 24 month . Each participant follow 16 month time first injection . Safety parameter monitor throughout part study . The primary immunological endpoint part measurement antigen-specific antibody response .</detailed_description>
