	<brief_summary>Carboplatin kill cancer cell mainly induction DNA damage ( drug-DNA adduct ) . The goal clinical trial determine chemoresistance carboplatin identify measure carboplatin-induced DNA monoadducts , precursor Pt-DNA diadducts crosslinks , subtherapeutic drug dos give prior initiation chemotherapy . We hypothesize low level carboplatin-DNA monoadducts rapid drug-DNA adduct repair correlate chemoresistance . A highly sensitive technology , call accelerator mass spectrometry ( AMS ) , used measure carboplatin-DNA monoadducts patient sample . AMS measure C-14 attomole level specimens milligram size . In study , patient receive one non-toxic `` microdose '' ( define 1/100th therapeutic dose ) C-14-labeled carboplatin . Blood specimens draw determination carboplatin-DNA monoadduct formation repair peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) determine serum ultrafiltrate . In patient microdosed prior provide tumor sample , milligram leftover tumor biopsy/resection specimens analyzed formation carboplatin-DNA monoadducts . Patients subsequently receive carboplatin-based chemotherapy . The level microdose-induced carboplatin-DNA monoadducts correlate response chemotherapy . Some blood biopsy sample assay RT-PCR several putative resistance marker mRNA level . Side effect also monitor compare AMS data . This trial also utilize PK , DNA repair pharmacogenomics data order determine underlie chemoresistance mechanism .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants must clinical diagnosis lung bladder cancer . The term `` clinical diagnosis '' mean patient diagnose NSCLC bladder transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) base image study , need biopsy/resection obtain tissue order confirm diagnosis . However , patient may cancer determine pathology examination tissue , may different cancer biopsy/resection perform . If diagnosis NSCLC bladder cancer confirm , platinumbased chemotherapy must plan either neoadjuvant chemotherapy Stage II bladder cancer , palliative therapy stage III IV lung bladder cancer regardless patient participation study . Stage II TCC patient stage IV NSCLC patient receive platinumbased chemotherapy eligible study . Patients Stage III IV lung bladder cancer must measurable lesion ( ) . Prior radiation surgery allow , finish least 2 week prior study enrollment . If participant prior radiation therapy , least one measurable lesion outside radiation field available evaluation response chemotherapy . Participants must 18 year old . We see patient NSCLC bladder TCC diagnose age 18 year . ECOG performance status equal le 2 ( Karnofsky equal great 50 % ) . Life expectancy least 3 month . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count great than/equal 1,500/microL ; Platelet count great than/equal 100,000/microL ; Total bilirubin less 1.5 X ULN ; AST ( SGOT ) less than/equal 2.5 X ULN ; Creatinine le 1.5 X ULN Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry 30 day study participation . Ability understand willing sign write informed consent document . Patients must receive concomitant radiation chemotherapy measurable lesion outside radiation field . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Participants pregnant nursing . Participants allergic platinum agent . Participants receive chemotherapy include cisplatin , carboplatin oxaliplatin .</criteria>
