	<brief_summary>Current antiplatelet therapy acute coronary syndrome focus dual antiplatelet therapy include aspirin clopidogrel . However , patient 's drug resistance aspirin clopidogrel important cause poor clinical prognosis . Therefore , recently , clinical research triple antiplatelet therapy include cilostazol actively conduct . But , clinical research triple antiplatelet therapy acute myocardial infarction inadequate situation , ideal duration triple antiplatelet therapy actively discuss . Therefore , try evaluate clinical outcome triple antiplatelet therapy acute myocardial infarction patient undergo percutaneous intervention drug elute stent compare dual antiplatelet therapy investigate ideal duration triple antiplatelet therapy research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Drug-eluting stent ( DES ) drastically change landscape percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , significant reduction angiographic restenosis rate need repeat revascularization . However , several study show DES associate high incidence in-stent thrombosis compare bare metal stent . Therefore , late guideline antiplatelet therapy PCI DES suggest dual antiplatelet therapy ( aspirin plus clopidogrel ) administer least 12 months.But enough high-risk patient ? Some study show many 50 % patient receive PCI react positively aspirin clopidogrel.Furthermore , increased platelet activity acute coronary syndrome , especially acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) . compare aspirin clopidogrel.A recent study suggest cilostazol could ameliorate platelet responsiveness clopidogrel patient underwent primary PCI . Furthermore , study show administration cilostazol PCI could significantly low incidence in-stent restenosis . Therefore , present study design evaluate safety efficacy additional administration cilostazol aspirin clopidogrel real-world cardiology practice among patient present AMI receive primary PCI DES .</detailed_description>
