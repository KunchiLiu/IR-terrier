	<detailed_description>This study aim investigate whether liver patient may tolerate alitretinoin . Toctino ( alitretinoin ) vitamin A like substance proven effective treatment specially hand eczema . The medicine take capsule daily 3 month . Toctino currently approve patient normal liver function , never study drug metabolism excretion occur liver disease patient . This , however , investigator want examine order achieve additional treatment patient severe hand eczema concomitant liver disease . The study collaboration dermatology medical department , Gentofte Hospital University Copenhagen , blood urine test conduct . From medical department , 8 patient diagnose liver disease recruit . Patients receive single dose Toctino ( 30 mg capsule ) . 20 blood sample one urine sample take next 24 hour ( approximately 250-300 ml ) measure concentration Toctino blood urine . Moreover , urine collect 24 hour . Then investigator recruit 8-person control group match accord gender , age weight . In control group take exactly sample . Based determine concentration blood urine able mathematically calculate Toctino absorb , distribute excrete liver disease patient conjunction healthy control group . The study therefore help determine dose Toctino would preferable liver disease patient . The survey estimate associated low risk participate patient control group . Toctino approve drug side effect occur almost exclusively long term treatment .</detailed_description>
