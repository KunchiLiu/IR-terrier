	<brief_title>Intraocular Pressure During Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Procedures Utilizing Steep Trendelenburg Positioning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The National Cancer Institute estimate 218,890 new case prostate cancer diagnosed 2007 . The three commonly choose option localize prostate cancer radical prostatectomy ( RP ) , external radiation therapy ( XRT ) , interstitial brachytherapy ( BT ) . A variety surgical approach available , include open , laparoscopic , robotic prostatectomy . With current trend towards `` minimally invasive '' technique , laparoscopic prostatectomy ( LP ) , particular , robotic assist LP rise . Since gain FDA approval 2001 , robotic procedure gain 1/3 market share . Preliminary data suggest number may grow 50 % prostatectomy cancer perform United States . The minimally invasive procedure offer advantage relative open alternative : small incision , improve pain control , decrease blood loss , fast recovery well document . Cancer specific quality life ( sexual function , continence ) outcome need long term evaluation definitive advantage minimally invasive technique state . Furthermore , potential risk minimally invasive method fully elucidate . During laparoscopic robotic prostatectomy , patient subject marked Trendelenberg position throughout majority procedure . The effect body position show previously affect intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . However , effect surgical positioning IOP prostatectomy well study definitively know . Anecdotal report postoperative vision loss follow robotic assist laparoscopic prostatectomy surface thus research require study effect procedure prostate cancer may IOP vision .</detailed_description>
