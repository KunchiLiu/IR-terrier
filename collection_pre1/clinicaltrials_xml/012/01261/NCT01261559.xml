	<brief_summary>The primary hypothesis study breast displacement direct plane imaging compute tomography ( CT ) abdomen reduce effective radiation dose female breast . Secondary hypothesis image noise artifacts also decrease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breast Displacement CT Radiation Dose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Computed tomography ( CT ) significant source medical-related radiation , radiation-related cancer risk increasingly recognize medical lay community . One group great risk radiation-induced malignancy young female due radiosensitivity female breast tissue . Breast tissue frequently lie within image plane CT abdomen limit gain diagnostic information . We propose displace breast tissue direct image plane decrease unnecessary radiation exposure may also indirectly improve image quality . A device call Chrysalis design received FDA approval purpose displace female breast tissue CT .</detailed_description>
