	<detailed_description>Labour pain regard one serious kind pain.In many country labour pain effectively treat request labour woman . In The Netherlands , labour pain traditionally approach conservatively . However , policy rapidly change effective treatment request.Epidural analgesia ( EA ) prove one effective method pain relief labour.In addition , EA lead increase patient satisfaction . Compared ( ) method pain relief , however , EA associate use oxytocin , long second stage labour , instrumental vaginal delivery . Other possible adverse effect labour woman EA hypotension , motor block , urine retention , fever . These complication adverse effect possible reason , EA still widely advise accept The Netherlands.However , question whether adverse effect cause EA , observation bias still unanswered . The study perform address item applicable general population woman deliver child , perform woman strong need pain relief.Generally , need pain relief increase progression labour difficult , example case relatively great child ineffective contraction , especially nulliparous woman . It well know group labour woman , also without EA , obstetrical problem increase . On hand , multivariable analysis factor associate arrest labour indicates , woman EA decrease risk arrest labour . At present , randomize control trial study obstetrical consequence EA nulliparous woman without strong need pain relief lacking . Besides , study extensively look preference woman EA . It seem parity status , fear side effect EA , pain catastrophizing , desire pain-free childbirth , positive experience EA family friends influence odds choose EA . So , base international literature , ongoing increase The Netherlands EA 's maternal request delivery may result obstetrical problem increase health cost . Of course change pain treatment surround birth impact woman labour , well society . On one hand cost care likely increase due EA , EA expensive might lead augmentation medical complication , hand EA-group woman less pain labour compare non-EA group . The question remain , whether counteract proactive policy offering EA explicit maternal request pain relief absence obstetrical problem . It assume , proactive policy might result effective pain reduction increase patient satisfaction without increased obstetrical problem without increased health cost .</detailed_description>
