	<brief_summary>Median sternotomy standard incision coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) patient undergo surgery coronary artery disease . Given increase risk profile contemporary cardiac surgery patient , sternal complication subject increase concomitantly . Despite advance many area cardiac surgical procedure , innovation sternal closure technique lack postoperative complication remain . In study , investigator aim assess effectiveness use novel osteoconductive biologic bone cement ( KryptoniteTM , Doctors Research Group Inc. ) adjunct conventional sternal closure post CABG patient median sternotomy . The outcomes interest study include : pain , discomfort , lung function , wound heal analgesic use . The investigator assume use KryptoniteTM decrease postoperative pain lead improvement postoperative lung function . This may also lead improvement patient recovery decrease postoperative complication . The investigator undertake single-blinded randomized , control study consist patient undergo elective coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) randomly assign either Group A ( usual closure stainless steel wire ) Group B ( usual closure stainless steel wire plus application bone cement ) . Each group consist 64 patient total 128 patient . Lung function data use spirometer collect preoperatively 3rd 5th postoperative day well outpatient clinic . Pain data collect 1st 5th postoperative day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sternal Closure With Biologic Bone Cement Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ( CABG )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procedure Research assistant dedicate participant recruitment , data collection , assessment sternal wound . Upon admission , schedule surgery , consecutive CABG surgery patient median sternotomy approach research assistant preoperative screening ( determine eligibility study ) . Thereafter , inform consent seek examine recovery period approximately 16 post-operative week . When undertake clinical trial , randomization participant achieve use opaque envelope . Envelopes keep operation theatre open nurse surgeon prior surgery . This envelope also contain data collection form complete surgeon ( regard bone quality , sternotomy , number sternal wire ) . Following surgery , blind research assistant collect pain data participant 1st 5th postoperative day . These measure use 10-point numeric rating scale . The scale anchor descriptor 0=none , 10=worst . These data collect rest coughing . Lung function data ( FEV1.0 , FVC ) collect use bedside spirometer 3rd 5th postoperative day . Other relevant clinical data ( e.g. , age , graft use nature surgery , analgesic use , complication , length stay ) collect health record audit . Once participant discharge , data collection do return clinic follow-up . Additional Outcomes Other outcome monitor include : postoperative death within 6 week , abnormal prolongation wound healing , length ICU stay , length hospital stay , postoperative pleural effusion , necessity evacuate effusion , atelectasis , pneumonia , reoperation require sternal reentry , sternal dehiscence , wound infection ( superficial deep ) , mediastinitis , amount analgesia , cause morbidity . Sample Size There much information prior study . It assume mean difference change FEV1.0 , FVC pain score 5 day surgery bone cement control group 15 % standard deviation 25 % respectively . With assumption , two-sided test , overall level significance 5 % power 80 % , number patient need enrol study 64 patient per group account 1 % chance patient may major postoperative complication prevent patient extubated 5 day surgery . The total number patient need recruit study 128 patient . Data Collection Participants recruit in-hospital data collect research assistant hire study . Staff nurse ward also collect in-hospital data . They train use study questionnaire measure . Once patient discharged hospital , assistant also follow-up outpatient clinic . Data Analysis For study , investigator wish assess effectiveness KryptoniteTM pain , change postoperative lung function use spirometry . Although investigator interested outcomes time , effectiveness intervention acute period postoperatively well 6 postoperative week great interest . In order investigate difference percentage change FEV1.0 , FVC pain score 5 day surgery bone cement control group , 2 sample t-test carry respectively normality homogeneity variance assumption meet ; otherwise , Mann-Whitney U test use respectively . The association postoperative death early period surgery type group ( bone cement control group ) evaluate use Chi-Square test assumption Chi-Square test meet ; otherwise , Fisher 's Exact test carry . Other outcomes monitor summarize surgery type group use descriptive statistic . All analysis perform use PASW Statistics 18 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) . SAFETY Safety , particularly relate sternal union wound heal , major importance study . In particular , sternal union monitor patient visual inspection . All participant undergo visual inspection palpation sternum , team doctor nurse , regularly throughout course study . Should concern arise sternum wound healing , digital photograph sternum ( use appropriate draping patient privacy ) may take , refer his/her consultant surgeon charge . The photograph use assist document healing process . DESIGN ISSUES There number important issue relate blinding , design co-intervention . Addressing Issues Observer Blinding l All collect data train rigorously standardize study procedure use questionnaire measure . l The nature data collect patient 's opinion/response . l A manual operation develop research associate ' use assistance question/concerns available telephone time . l Although double blind desirable clinical trial design minimize/eliminate observation bias , possible blind surgeon . The data collection member keep blinded regard group participant . Addressing Issues Participant Blinding l The outcome measure study participative nature , particularly compare often used clinical trial research ( e.g. , mortality/morbidity ) . Yet , outcome data highly relevant determine effectiveness use sternal closure technique , particular population . As stated project objective , one goal evaluate effect intervention pain discomfort ; important patient . l A 'placebo ' neither achievable feasible . Surgeons involve participant 's care divulge group participant assign . ETHICAL/SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS The conduct study conform standard DSRB . Data management undertaken use DSRB standard maintain patient confidentiality . FEASIBILITY Cardiac surgeon National University Hospital offer intervention study . The investigator anticipate take approximately 12 month recruit study sample 4 month thereafter complete data collection .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients present elective isolated onpump CABG surgery use leave internal mammary artery graft , firsttime median sternotomy age 50 79 , provide inform consent participate . Patients : emergent need surgery , prior median sternotomy , applicable use leave internal mammary artery graft , highrisk early postoperative bleed require reopen chest ( take antiplatelet medication within 24 hour surgery ) , previous radiotherapy chest , present clinical preoperative state suggest prolonged recovery ( e.g. , concurrent illness significant respiratory disease renal failure require dialysis , current use steroid , residence longterm care facility , current substance abuse ) , present cognitive impairment ( e.g. , confusion , dementia , Alzheimer 's disease ) would preclude completion survey question , ineligible .</criteria>
