	<brief_summary>The recombinant human fusion protein L19TNFα create intention overcome systemic toxicity TNFα directly target tumor tissue . Tumor-targeted L19TNFα would result high sustain intralesional bioactive TNFα concentration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>L19TNFα Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary purpose Phase I/II study define safe potentially active treatment regimen L19TNFα monotherapy evaluate antitumor activity regimen relapse metastatic colorectal cancer subject , standard treatment option exhaust . L19TNFα investigational drug specifically effectively bind ED-B , abundantly express cancer tissue . Accordingly , treatment result high long-lasting intratumoral accumulation biologically active rh-TNFα . Although combined therapy TNFα cytotoxic drug ( e.g . melphalan ) seem strikingly active sarcoma melanoma TNFα alone - least ILP set seem possible repeat intratumoral delivery TNFα via L19TNFα might produce additional biologic effect , induction immunologic antitumor response sustain inhibition tumor-associated angiogenesis ( Lejeune , 2006 ) , potentially could benefit advanced cancer subject .</detailed_description>

Phase II : histologically cytologically confirm relapsed refractory locally advance metastatic colorectal cancer amenable standard therapy . For phase I II : Subjects age ≥ 18 year . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 . Subjects must least one unidimensionally measurable lesion compute tomography define RECIST criterion ( see Section 8 ) tumour marker parameter disease PSA CA125 Prostate cancer Ovarian cancer , respectively . This lesion must irradiate previous treatment . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L , platelet ≥ 100 x 10^9/L , haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥ 9.5 g/dl . All acute adverse effect ( exclude alopecia ) prior therapy ( include surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy ) must resolve ≤ Grade 1 , except elevate liver transaminase judge associated tumor infiltration ( see ) ( grade accord National Cancer Institute [ NCI ] Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events , version 3.0 [ CTCAE , v.3.0 ] ) . Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and/or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/gL unless liver involvement tumor , case transaminase level 5 x ULN allow . Creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN 24 h creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min . Testing negative acute chronic infection hepatitis B C virus , human immunodeficiency virus 1 2 . Negative pregnancy test female childbearing potential screening visit . Commitment subject practice medically appropriate/acceptable method birth control ( e.g. , hormonal , condoms adequate barrier control , intrauterine contraceptive device , sterilization ) begin screen visit continue 3 month follow last treatment study drug . Able provide write Informed Consent . Breastfeeding woman . Presence active infection ( e.g . require antimicrobial therapy ) severe concurrent disease , , opinion Investigator , would place subject undue risk interfere study . Known brain metastasis sign and/or symptom suggestive brain metastasis . Known cancer primary origin ( exclude Stage I nonmelanoma skin cancer ) within prior 5 year . Active autoimmune disease . Cardiac disease manifest follow : &gt; Grade II heart failure , grade per New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) criterion . Unstable angina pectoris . Acute subacute coronary syndrome , include myocardial infarction , occur 1 year prior study treatment . Arrhythmia need continuous treatment . Ejection fraction less institutional low limit normal assess multigated radionuclide angiography ( MUGA ) scan echocardiogram . Uncontrolled hypertension . Ischemic peripheral vascular disease ( Grade IIbIV ) . Severe diabetic retinopathy . Major surgery trauma within 4 week prior start study treatment . Known history allergy TNFα intravenously administer human proteins/peptides/antibodies . Chemotherapy , radiation therapy therapy investigational agent within 4 week prior start study treatment . Previous vivo exposure monoclonal antibody biological therapy 6 week administration study treatment . Growth factor immunomodulatory agent within 7 day prior administration study treatment . Subject require take corticosteroid immunosuppressant drug longterm basis . Limited use corticosteroid treat prevent acute hypersensitivity reaction consider exclusion criterion . Concurrent therapy warfarin dose great 1 mg/day equivalent dos coumarin derivative . Participation another interventional clinical trial participation trial . Expectation subject able complete least 6 week therapy . Any condition opinion Investigator could hamper compliance study protocol .</criteria>
