	<brief_title>Intratumoral Application L19IL2 Patients With Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase II , non-randomized , multicenter , prospective study design test efficacy safety intratumorally administer L19IL2 . L19IL2 bind high affinity EDB domain Fibronectin , marker angiogenesis strongly upregulated malignant melanoma lesion . This binding lead increase residence time protein site disease . The biologic effect IL2 moiety identical one free IL-2 . The study treatment 20 MioIU L19IL2 per week patient suffer histopathologically-proven malignant melanoma presence injectable soft-tissue metastasis either clinical stage III stage IV M1a without visceral metastasis . The duration treatment could 20 week . After end study visit follow-up perform every 6 week 12 month enrollment patient . Tumor assessment perform within 2 week start treatment week 12 use immune-related response criterion RECIST 1.1 . To assure patient develop visceral metastasis treatment , additional tumor assessment perform already week 6 start therapy . Assessments week 24 36 perform accord RECIST vs. 1.1 criterion . Treatment emergent adverse event summarized Common Toxicity Criteria ( version 4.02 , CTCAE ) bad grade treat patient . Laboratory value change vital sign summarize .</detailed_description>
