	<detailed_description>The impact extra pulmonary manifestation Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) physical performance quality life , together notion plasma cytokine COPD due overflow inflammatory mediator lung compartment , raise interest understand potential link lung systemic inflammation . Recent study , perform normal subject use threshold breathing device [ simple method increase respiratory resistance inspiratory muscle load ] show ventilatory muscle activation load breathing may prime reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) production , thus initiate inflammatory response within diaphragm result systemic elevation pro-inflammatory cytokine . These finding provide sound working hypothesis origin systemic inflammation COPD . Endurance task failure inspiratory muscle challenge inspiratory resistive breathing ( IRB ) exercise perform either nonlinear threshold load device [ 4-6 ] , thus allow simulate resistive breathing cause airway narrow occur COPD exacerbation Therapy mineral water widely use modality physical therapy country rich mineral water . Up date , however , consider among treatment option chronic pulmonary disease recent guideline . Mud bath therapy acknowledge antioxidant anti-inflammatory effect several chronic disease . Although full mechanism effect yet fully elucidate , previous vivo study effect several anion duration active state skeletal muscle indicate trace element thermal treatment , particularly iodide bromide , may positively intervene setup maintenance active state . These finding suggest COPD patient element may improve load endurance respiratory muscle therefore blunt ventilatory muscle overactivation ensue inflammatory cytokine response . In study investigator want test two major hypothesis . First , mud bath therapy reduce systemic inflammatory process COPD patient , increase respiratory muscle endurance normalizes ventilatory response . Second , increase systemic inflammation IRB exercise blunt mud bath therapy .</detailed_description>
