	<brief_summary>Robotic device capable provide therapy arm patient weakness due stroke . Robotic therapy improve aspect stroke related arm weakness , use weak arm real life situation often remain limited . The goal study determine best way use robotic device functional task training improve use stroke affect arm real life situation . A secondary goal study determine specific area brain excite training . The use safe painless magnetic field direct brain call transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) use set interval gain good understand brain activity recovery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtain informed consent , participant undergo 3 session baseline test use upper extremity motor assessment shoulder , elbow , wrist , thumb grip . Upper extremity kinematic strength test perform rehabilitation robot measurement mode . The rehabilitation robot module include wrist , planar ( shoulder-elbow ) , alternate wrist shoulder-elbow robot . These robotic device clear marketing register medical device U.S. FDA regulation list FDA evaluation device therapy device . Patients randomize receive 12 week robotic therapy session 12 week robot therapy combine transition task therapy . Study intervention occur 3 time week 12 week . Robot therapy consist progression three robot module : wrist , planar , alternate wrist shoulder-elbow robot . The progression sequential four week train robotic device . All participant complete motor activity log intervention phase . TMS use physiological measurement evaluation conduct participant baseline , week one , week five , eight , final . TMS also occur follow-up week twenty-four . Disability depression questionnaire , upper extremity measure evaluation functional performance conduct study baseline , train completion ( visit 36 ) . Patients return twelve week end training period determine whether observed improvement persist .</detailed_description>
