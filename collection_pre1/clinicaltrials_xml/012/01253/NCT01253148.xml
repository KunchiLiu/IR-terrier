	<brief_title>Study Of Intrahepatic Arterial Injection 90-Y Glass Microspheres Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal treatment TheraSphere allow large dose radiation deliver directly tumor less risk toxic effect radiation part body healthy liver tissue compare currently available treatment . The standard treatment cholangiocarcinoma surgery ( possible ) , external beam radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy . External beam radiation therapy liver may reduce symptom , 20 % patient experience significant tumor shrinkage . Chemotherapy response rate range 6-19 % . More recently , new approach develop , call TheraSphere . Based result earlier study TheraSphere , study doctor Moffitt feel reasonable alternative standard treatment disease . TheraSphere restrict approval United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment hepatocellular liver cancer ; yet approve treatment cholangiocarcinoma . TheraSphere medical device contain yttrium-90 ( Y-90 ) , radioactive material use previously treatment liver tumor . Y-90 incorporated tiny glass bead call microspheres inject liver blood vessel supply liver .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must newly diagnose recurrent ( post surgery ) histologically cytologically proven cholangiocarcinoma . Patients solitary , multifocal unilobar , bilobar disease without evidence extrahepatic involvement . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 10 mm spiral compute tomography ( CT ) scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Age &gt; 18 year Life expectancy great 3 month base physician judgment Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky 50 % ) No prior chemotherapy radiation treatment cholangiocarcinoma ChildsPugh score A ChildsPugh score B without portal vein thrombus Lung shunting predicts lung dose &lt; 30 Gy single treatment The effect TheraSpheres develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason radioactive sphere know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Adequate baseline hematopoietic function : total white blood cell count equal great 3,000/mm³ absolute granulocyte count great 1,500/mm³ platelet count equal great 100,000/mm³ Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 Patients receive investigational agent Patients extrahepatic disease Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Pregnant woman exclude study TheraSpheres radioactive radiation know agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother TheraSpheres , breastfeed discontinue mother treated TheraSpheres . Patients immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . In addition , antiretrovirals know radiation sensitizer could dramatically increase risk fulminant hepatic failure . Therefore , HIVpositive patient exclude study possible lethal side effect . Bulk disease ( tumor volume &gt; 70 % target liver volume , tumor nodule numerous count ) Aspartic transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &gt; 5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dL ChildPugh C Liver Cirrhosis Tumor volume &gt; 50 % combine albumin &lt; 3 g/dL Complete occlusion main portal vein cause portal hypertension</criteria>
