	<brief_summary>Hearing loss one common health concern affect 1 3 Americans 60 year age rise 1 2 85 year old . Contributions hear ability provide cognitive memory process universally recognize essential adequate speech communication , process well understood . Cognitive limitation ability rapidly process sequential sound occur listener may impact old Veterans without hear impairment . The purpose study examine thoroughly characterize change auditory work memory hearing loss increase age . Young old listener without hear loss listen report two target sound embed stream rapidly occur sound . The investigator expect old listener without hear loss difficulty young listener older listener hear impairment difficulty task even sound listen adjust compensate hearing loss .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose pilot study understand memory change age failure work memory rapid sound processing may account speech perception difficulty report old Veteran listener especially hear loss . A period processing interference ( limitation ) identify rapid auditory visual processing . Specifically , subject ask report two targeted event embed rapid stream distractor event , ability report second target diminish occurs interval approximately 200-400ms follow first target . This identified failure work memory consolidation robust visual auditory processing . Much know failure work memory affect young normal hear listener little known effect old listener listener hear loss . A lengthened period processing interference likely present among old listener . This important speech rapid old listener often report difficulty auditory environment multiple speaker present . Further , old listener , likely hearing loss , continue report problem hear noisy environment even hear aid optimally functional . The presence prolong period processing interference auditory system could account complaint , completely understood , could remediate . Up 75 subject , age 18-30 60-75 year invite participate . Subjects undergo complete audiological evaluation do assign one three arms/groups to15 subject . Arms compose young subject normal hearing ( YNH ) , old subject normal hearing ( ONH ) old subject mild hear impairment ( OHI ) . Each subject ask listen 18 26 non-overlapping tone 30ms duration follow 70ms silent interval . Target tone tone complex ( T1 T2 ) embed stream . Sequences could contain ( equal probability ) ) target , b ) T1 , c ) T2 ) target . At end stream , subject require make untimed judgment whether stream contain T1 ( yes/no ) T2 ( yes/no ) . This project self-paced . The hypothesized finding young listener without hear impairment difficulty report T2 follow T1 approximately 200-400ms interval . However , old listener without hear impairment demonstrate prolong period interference ( &gt; 400ms ) slightly poor performance overall old listener hear impairment even longer lasting period process interference overall large deficit ( poor performance ) suggest increase age hearing impairment combine reveal significant processing deficit group . These result would provide much need explanation way rapid processing ( precisely speech ) degrade hear impairment , age , combination two .</detailed_description>
