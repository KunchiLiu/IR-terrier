	<detailed_description>The primary objectiveof clinical trial determine efficacy brivanib treatment metastatic renal cell carcinoma term progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient whi progress treatment sunitinib , sorafenib , bevacizumab , pazopanib . The primary endpoint trial PFS 16 week . The secondary objective examine safety tolerability profile brivanib , examine efficacy brivanib population term best overall response , response rate , progression-free survival , overall survival , describe baseline change I-cG250 PET/CT relation observe therapeutic effects. , describe novel baseline histologic feature tumor relation observe therapeutic effect . Modalities include VHL HIF expression assessment novel 'histocytometric ' assessment tumor microenvironment term p-STAT3 , p-ERK , Ki67 , VEGFR2 , FGFR1 expression. , describe change circulate collagen IV brivanib relation therapeutic effects. , explore relationship single nucleotide polymorphism angiogenesis-related gene activity brivanib treatment patient .</detailed_description>
