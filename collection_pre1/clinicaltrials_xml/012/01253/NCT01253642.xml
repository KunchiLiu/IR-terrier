	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give phenelzine sulfate together docetaxel work treat patient prostate cancer grow , spread , get bad first-line therapy docetaxel . Phenelzine sulfate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Phenelzine sulfate may also help docetaxel work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . Giving phenelzine sulfate together docetaxel may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phenelzine Sulfate Docetaxel Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer With Progressive Disease After First-Line Therapy With Docetaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine proportion patient experience prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) decline least 30 % within 12 week initiation combination therapy phenelzine ( phenelzine sulfate ) add docetaxel patient evidence progression standard docetaxel . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration progression free survival initiation combination phenelzine docetaxel therapy . II . To determine response rate measurable disease Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion initiation combination phenelzine docetaxel therapy . III . To report maximum change PSA baseline 12 week ( early patient discontinue early ) waterfall plot initiation combination phenelzine docetaxel therapy . IV . To determine toxicity combination regimen castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) previously treat docetaxel . V. To determine time death cause . VI . To determine frequency monoamine oxidase A ( MAOA ) overexpression CRPC tumor progress docetaxel . VII . To compare level MAOA expression primary diagnostic tissue ( e.g . biopsy radical prostatectomy ) CRPC tumor progress docetaxel . VIII . To correlate MAOA overexpression CRPC tumor response combination study treatment . IX . To collect blood tissue specimens future molecular correlative study . X . To validate MAOA assessment circulate tumor cell . XI . To assess correlation tissue expression MAOA . XII . To measure hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) -1alpha expression potential biomarkers circulate tumor cell potential measure MAO activity . TERTIARY OUTCOMES : I . To measure expression lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 ( LSD1 ) CRPC tumor progress docetaxel correlate endpoint describe primary objective secondary objective I , II , III , V. II . To conduct gene expression study CRPC tumor progress docetaxel correlate correlate endpoint describe primary objective secondary objective I , II , III V. OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study phenelzine sulfate . Patients receive phenelzine sulfate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day -7 -4 , twice daily ( BID ) day -3 21 . Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day least 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month .</detailed_description>
