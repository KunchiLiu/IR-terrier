	<brief_title>Pulse Oximeter Responses Multiple Levels Stable Hypoxia Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers University California , San Francisco develop method permit test multiple pulse oximeter sensor neonates simultaneously cardiac surgery . During type surgery , arterial oxygen saturation change wide range , provide ideal arena assessment neonatal pulse oximeter sensor many level oxygen saturation . Several arterial blood gas sample typically obtain procedure . Saturation arterial blood sample determine direct oximetry hemoximeter measurement compare reading display pulse oximeter .</detailed_description>
