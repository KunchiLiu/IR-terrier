	<brief_title>Evaluating Strategies Reduce Mother-to-Child Transmission HIV Infection Populations Using Formula Feeding ( PROMISE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence mother-to-child transmission HIV decrease recent year United States , Europe , resource-advantaged country . Several factor contribute decrease , include administration HAART pregnancy , caesarean section delivery method , use formula instead breastfeed feed infant . However , improvement mostly see United States , Europe , resource-advantaged area . In resource-limited country , barrier implementation effective intervention prevention mother-to-child transmission ( PMTCT ) still remain . The PROMISE study evaluate effective method prevent transmission HIV mother baby pregnancy , labor delivery , breastfeed . This version PROMISE study conduct research site Africa part world formula feed standard . This study divide two part : 1 . Antepartum Component : This part study compare safety effectiveness different HAART regimens prevent transmission HIV pregnancy , labor , delivery . Pregnant HIV-infected woman randomly assign one follow three group : Arm A : Participants receive zidovudine ( ZDV ) + single dose nevirapine ( sdNVP ) + emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( Truvada [ TRV ] ) tail . Participants receive ZDV 14 week gestation delivery , sdNVP TRV onset labor , TRV postpartum 7 day Week 1 visit ( 6-14 day postpartum ) , whichever later . Arm B : Participants receive lamivudine ( 3TC ) -zidovudine ( ZDV ) + lopinavir ( LPV ) -ritonavir ( RTV ) . Participants receive triple antiretroviral ( ARV ) study drug regimen 14 week gestation Week 1 visit ( 6-14 day postpartum ) . Arm C : Participants receive TRV/LPV-RTV . Participants receive triple ARV study drug regimen 14 week gestation Week 1 visit ( 6-14 day postpartum ) . Fixed-dose FTC-TDF-RPV ( Complera ) may use alternative first-line regimen mother able tolerate adhere LPV-RTV ATV-RTV . The FTC-TDF-RPV regimen define protocol determine discretion staff study site . All infant bear woman enrol study receive NVP day 42 day age Week 6 study visit , whichever later , regardless study arm mother enrol . Should woman need HAART switch HAART regimens health , move Step 2 Step 3 part study . During pregnancy , participant attend study visit study entry , 2 4 week entry , every 4 week labor delivery . Women infant monitor labor delivery attend study visit 6 14 day delivery . Follow-up visit occur Weeks 1 , 6 , 14 . Thereafter , month infant every 3 month woman . Study visit may include medical history review , questionnaire , interview , physical exam , blood collection . 2 . Maternal Health Component : This part study examine woman receive triple ARV regimen pregnancy good health outcome woman discontinue triple ARV regimen . Participants include woman receive triple ARV regimen Antepartum Component . Participants randomly assign one two study arm : Arm A : Participants continue receive triple ARV regimen ( TRV LPV-RTV ) . Arm B : Participants discontinue triple ARV regimen . Study visit occur Weeks 4 12 , every 3 month thereafter . Women infect hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) additional visit Week 8 . Study visit may include medical history review , questionnaire , physical exam , blood collection . Should woman need triple ARV regimen switch triple ARV regimens health , move Step 2 Step 3 part study . The total duration two study component 5 year . Women remain study follow-up 2 5 year , depend enroll . Infants remain study 74 104 week age . Follow-up woman infant complete end September 2016 .</detailed_description>
