	<brief_title>Pazopanib Patients With Relapsed Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine progression-free survival rate participant relapse refractory small cell lung cancer receive one prior regimen systemic chemotherapy 8 week Secondary - To determine response rate ( measure RECIST 1.1 criterion change blood flow/perfusion measure perfusion CT ) - To determine median overall survival - To characterize toxicity profile pazopanib patient population . Exploratory - To analyze level circulate biomarkers blood urine sample obtain serially throughout study assess utility individual subset proteins serve surrogate marker treatment effect , treatment efficacy , tumor progression - To measure investigate use monocytes surrogate marker angiogenesis inhibition - To analyze subject population identification intra-tumoral biomarkers ( c-kit , VEGF receptor , microvessel density measure available tumor biopsy ) associate efficacy , safety resistance pazopanib - To assess utility perfusion CT scan evaluating change anti-angiogenic activity measure treatment efficacy STATISTICAL DESIGN : This study use two-stage design evaluate efficacy cetuximab base progression-free rate ( PFR ) week 8 define complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) per RECIST 1.1 criterion . The null alternative PFR 30 % 50 % . If few 4 patient enrol stage one cohort ( n=15 patient ) achieve SD good accrual would proceed stage two ( n=15 patient ) . If 13 patient progression-free 30 patient null hypothesis reject . The probability treatment consider promising true PFR rate 30 % 8.4 % 82 % true PFR rate 50 % .</detailed_description>
