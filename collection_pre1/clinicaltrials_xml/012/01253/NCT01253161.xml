	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn study drug , Pasireotide LAR shrink slow growth Metastatic Neuroendocrine Carcinomas . The safety drug also study . The patient 's physical state , change size tumor , laboratory finding take on-study help u decide Pasireotide LAR safe effective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Pasireotide Long Acting Release ( LAR ) Patients With Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors ( NETs )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-institutional , prospective phase II open-label trial . The investigational drug use study pasireotide LAR 60mg . Pasireotide administered intramuscular injection begin every cycle define 28 day ( +/- 3 day ) . Study treatment begin within 14 day follow enrollment study continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent . Safety efficacy assess throughout treatment period .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Locally unresectable metastatic carcinoid pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor Tumors must consider well moderately differentiate ( low intermediate grade ) . Patients poorly differentiate neuroendocrine carcinoma small cell carcinoma exclude study . No prior systemic antineoplastic neuroendocrine tumor treatment ( include prior somatostatin analog ) . However patient receive short course subcutaneous ( SQ ) octreotide ( &lt; 10 day ) past eligible &gt; 1 week elapse last octreotide injection . Minimum four week since major surgery Measureable disease Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤1 Life expectancy 12 week Adequate bone marrow function show : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L , Platelets ≥ 75 x 10^9/L , hemoglobin ( Hgb ) &gt; 8 g/dL Adequate liver function show : serum bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , serum transaminase activity ≤ 2 x ULN , exception serum transaminase ( &lt; 3 x ULN ) patient liver metastases Adequate renal function show serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 x ULN Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . Note : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day administration first study treatment . Women must lactate .
