	<brief_summary>Background : - People cerebral palsy often difficulty walk move leg . Cerebral palsy sometimes identify child almost 2 year age , mean early motor skill development affect repercussion later development . Studies adults neurological injury ( e.g. , stroke , spinal cord injury ) show important start intensive therapy soon injury , may true start intensive therapy young age helpful child cerebral palsy . Researchers interested test effectiveness special body weight support system mobility training young child risk cerebral palsy . Objectives : - To study effectiveness mobility train program motor skill young child risk cerebral palsy . Eligibility : - Children 12 36 month age delay motor skill either diagnosed cerebral palsy show evidence spasticity brain damage . Design : - This study involve two 6-week study phase : baseline phase mobility training program . - Participants screen physical examination medical history . - During baseline phase , participant mobility test session every 2 week . These test measure motor development ability , include ease speed walk . - Participants ' parents/guardians receive mobility sensor child wear home least 6 hour ( awake time ) measure activity mobility level outside test session . - After 6 week baseline testing , participant 6 week mobility train 30 minute 3 day per week . Training involve motor task weight support , conduct pediatric physical therapist . Activities may include walking , climb incline step , squat reach toy . All session videotape . - To evaluate effect therapy program , participant test session every 2 week . - Parents/guardians also complete questionnaire provide feedback effectiveness therapy program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mobility Training Improve Motor Behavior Toddlers With Risk Cerebral Palsy : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose pilot study test feasibility effect functional mobility train program motor ability physical activity young child developmentally delay risk cerebral palsy ( CP ) . The study include sample 10 participant 12-36 month age least 4 month motor delay risk CP single-subject research design repeat measure baseline intervention phase . Participants biweekly assessment 6 week baseline phase subsequent 6 week mobility training phase , follow final assessment 6 week treatment withdraw . Assessments train occur Functional Applied Biomechanics ( FAB ) section . The mobility training program consist three day per week 30 minute treatment session use dynamic body weight support variety functional motor task . Children assist , limited , dynamic weight support system encourage participate variety age-appropriate mobility task . It hypothesize system combined functional activity practice facilitate development postural control strength , thereby improve walk ability . The primary outcome measure completion rate gross motor ability measure Gross Motor Function Measure ( GMFM ) . Secondary outcome measure include amount gross motor delay measure Bayley Motor Scale ( BMS ) , , Functional Mobility Scale ( FMS ) , spatiotemporal gait measure , amount physical activity daily life . Results pilot study use refine mobility training program , evaluate appropriateness select outcome measure , provide preliminary data large scale clinical trial .</detailed_description>
