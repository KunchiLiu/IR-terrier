	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn sapacitabine give combination 2 standard drug ( cyclophosphamide rituximab ) help control CLL SLL . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sapacitabine , Cyclophosphamide , Rituximab Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia , Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma ( CLL/SLL ) With Deletion ( 11q22-23 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Sapacitabine cyclophosphamide design damage DNA ( genetic material ) cancer cell , may cause cancer cell die . Rituximab design attach cancer cell damage , may cause cancer cell die . It also design cause immune system attack cancer cell . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive sapacitabine mouth 1 time day Days 1-3 28-day cycle . Try take sapacitabine least 1 hour 2 hour meal . On Days 1-3 cycle , also receive cyclophosphamide vein 30 minute , start 2 hour take sapacitabine . On Day 3 Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond , receive rituximab vein 6-8 hour . If side effect occur , study doctor may decide low study drug dos . If side effect dose , study staff check problem 2 hour dose . Other Drugs : On Days 1-14 Cycle 1 , take allopurinol mouth 1 time day low risk kidney damage . Before dose cyclophosphamide , receive Zofran ( ondansetron ) vein second low risk nausea . About 30-60 minute dose rituximab , take Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) Benadryl ( diphenhydramine hydrochloride ) mouth low risk side effect fever chill . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You also physical exam , include measurement vital sign , except Cycle 1 . - You ask side effect may . On Days 8 22 Cycle 1 , Day 15 every cycle : - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You ask side effect may . If disease good response doctor think need check status disease , bone marrow aspiration biopsy CT scan chest , abdomen pelvis prior Cycle 4 possibly every cycle ( Cycles 6 , 8 , 10 , ) . Length Study : Once doctor think disease best response , may receive 2 cycle study therapy . You longer able receive study drug disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . End-of-Treatment Visit : The following test procedure perform last cycle study drug : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Follow-Up Visits : At 2 6 month 1 2 year last dose study drug : - You ask side effect may drug may take . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - If doctor think disease completely respond , CT scan neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis confirm response . You also bone marrow aspiration biopsy confirm response . At 3 year last dose study drug 1 time year : - You ask side effect may drug may take . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You bone marrow aspiration biopsy doctor decide need check status disease . If doctor think need anytime follow-up , CT scan neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . Starting Year 3 , follow-up test procedures do local doctor convenient . The test result send MD Anderson . You tell study doctor staff start another cancer treatment follow-up . If occurs , follow-up study stop . This investigational study . Sapacitabine FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Cyclophosphamide rituximab FDA approve commercially available treat CLL SLL . The combination sapacitabine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab investigational . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
