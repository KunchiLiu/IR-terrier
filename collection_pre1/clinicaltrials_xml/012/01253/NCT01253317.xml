	<brief_summary>The investigator recruit child research study use medication know IGF-1 ( mecasermin INCRELEX ) see improve health child Rett syndrome ( RTT ) . To participate study child must female , age 2 12 genetic diagnosis ( MECP2 deletion mutation ) Rett Syndrome . As may know , treatment illness . Currently , standard management Rett syndrome supportive , mean attempt prevent complication treatment symptom . This study involve test investigational drug , mean even though IGF-1 approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use child , use treat Rett syndrome specifically . Information research help determine whether drug approve FDA future treatment Rett Syndrome . There five major goal study : 1 . As one feature Rett Syndrome unstable vital sign , investigator try determine IGF-1 effect normalize child 's pulse , blood pressure breathe pattern . During PHASE 2 , device call BioRadio® use monitor vital sign non-invasive way . This information record stored accompany laptop . Before start PHASE 2 , investigator would like `` beta-test '' BioRadio® PHASE 1 . As , investigator may ask try use BioRadio® child test fit performance equipment . Should choose enroll child PHASE 2 , investigator ask child wear BioRadio® two hour , two consecutive day every four week . 2 . The safety IGF-1 child Rett syndrome . The study personnel ask complete medication diary side effect report form regular basis . They assist complete telephone interview . Your child undergo 2 lumbar puncture perform bedside clinical research facility . In addition , laboratory test perform throughout study evaluate safety IGF-1 . These blood test similar provide routine clinical care . Your child undergo regular non-invasive comprehensive physical examination include neurological eye examination , tonsil evaluation , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , measurement height , weight head circumference . 3 . IGF-1 may improve child 's behavior , communication speech . In order measure , investigator evaluate child month treatment neurodevelopmental assessment neurological exam . All test use evaluation non-invasive . investigator also ask impression behavior day-to-day activity structure parental interview various questionnaire . 4 . We examine child 's cortical function use electroencephalography ( EEG ) conjunction presentation visual auditory stimulus . EEG non-invasive way record electrical activity child 's brain applying net electrode scalp . Through gain insight neural function correlate progression behavioral abnormality see individual RTT . By understand electrical brain activity produce abnormal behavior see RTT , well able identify whether treatment IGF-1 affect way brain communicates body . 5 . Children Rett Syndrome often unable regulate body temperature sometimes experience `` flush '' cheek exceptionally cold hand foot . The Qsensor® non-invasive device worn fabric bracelet continually measure child 's perspiration level body temperature . We would like use Qsensor® determine whether IGF-1 improve child 's ability regulate body temperature . As , ask child wear Qsensor® study visit . This wrist-worn sensor demonstrate safe comfortable may cause slight gray discoloration sensor contact child 's skin . This discoloration go away less day . The Qsensor® waterproof , therefore may wear shower child wash hand . If believe device broken , please contact study team immediately .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There two phase trial . Phase 1 intensive 6-week pharmacokinetic study require 3 inpatient stay 4 half-day outpatient visit . During in-patient session , IV line place frequent blood sample . A lumbar puncture perform physician begin end Phase 1 . The primary goal Phase 1 determine safety IGF-1 therapy girl RS . As , investigator ask monitor child 's blood sugar level use glucometer . Your child 's health utmost concern monitor continuously ensure safety . At end Phase 1 , option enrol daughter additional 20 week treatment IGF-1 Phase 2 trial . The investigator must successfully complete Phase 1 investigator move second phase trial large number patient . The second phase double-blinded ; mean neither family researcher know participant receive IGF-1 . The cross-over design trial mean subject receive 20 week either placebo IGF-1 , 6-week washout period , participant receive another 20 week alternate treatment . All girl enrol Phase 2 receive 20 week treatment IGF-1 . Girls enrol Phase 2 see monthly safety monitoring , developmental evaluation lab work . The investigator ask caregiver fill number questionnaire answer question regard daughter 's health , behavior quality life . The investigator also monitor daughter 's heart function ( ECG ) electrical activity brain ( EEG ) four time throughout Phase 2 . The BioRadio® child-friendly measurement device , capable record heart breathing pattern . The investigator ask child wear BioRadio® Qsensor® 2 hour quiet activity study visit , every 5 week . Data BioRadio® demonstrate treatment IGF-1 improve heart rhythm respiratory symptom girl RS . Data Qsensor® may indicate child 's perspiration level body temperature show sign normalize .</detailed_description>
