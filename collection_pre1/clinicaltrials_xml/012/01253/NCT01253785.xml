	<brief_title>Pulse Oximeter Responses Multiple Levels Stable Hypoxia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The testing conduct 10 healthy , consent , non-smoking subject accordance IRB approve Protocol . The subject shall distribute across gender range skin tone equally practical . An arterial line place radial artery subject 's right arm , sensor attach subject . The subject place semi-supine position allow breathe mouthpiece nose block nose-clip . Hypoxia induce subject , level oxyhemoglobin saturation ( 70 % 100 % ) achieve breathe mixture nitrogen , room air carbon dioxide . Inspired O2 concentration adjust breath-by-breath use computed saturation , base end-tidal PO2 PCO2 , sample mass spectrometer . Predicted level oxyhemoglobin saturation attain held stable . At minimum sixty second plateau , 0.5cc waste blood draw arterial line , follow first 1.0cc sample blood draw . After approximately thirty additional second , second 1.0cc sample blood draw take . The sample immediately analyze Radiometer OSM-3 multi-wavelength co-oximeter record . The SpO2 data oximeter collect via laptop computer . Concurrent end blood draw , marker generate laptop computer identify event .</detailed_description>
