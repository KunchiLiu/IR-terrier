	<detailed_description>The mechanisms food structure impact lipid digestion subsequent metabolic process , include impact satiety satiation , relatively unexplored , may great consequence development effective strategy weight management . Data previous study suggest ( ) droplet size fat emulsion distinct influence GI function visceral perception ( ii ) biomechanical digestive property human gut may induce micro structural change specifically design lipid emulsion result different pattern lipolysis . The study assess effect triglyceride emulsion different particle ( 0.6 , 30 Î¼m ) size sensitivity acidic shear environment stomach GI function kinetics endocrine satiation response . In study healthy participant study four occasion four separate day double blind randomized design . The assessment gastric function monitor novel MRI technique breath test neurohormonal response blood sampling .</detailed_description>
