	<brief_title>AKT Inhibitor MK-2206 Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine proportion patient achieve Morphologic Complete Response ( CR ) , Morphologic CR incomplete count recovery ( CRp ) Partial Response ( PR ) best response within 3 cycle therapy MK-2206 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe disease-free survival patient achieve CR/CRp . II . Determine toxicity profile single-agent MK-2206 patient population . III . To determine biologic effect MK-2206 leukemia cell . OUTLINE : Patients receive AKT inhibitor MK-2206 orally ( PO ) weekly . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
