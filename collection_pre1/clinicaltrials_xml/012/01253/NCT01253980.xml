	<brief_summary>Paraffin ( kerosene ) ingestion develop world account large number visit healthcare facility , especially amongst child . There evidence animal good evidence human use early antibiotic improve clinical outcome paraffin-induced pneumonitis . This randomise placebo-controlled trial investigate whether use early antibiotic affect clinical course child pneumonitis follow paraffin ingestion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The average 100 child per annum attending Red Cross War Memorial Children 's Hospital 9RCWMCH ) diagnosis kerosene ingestion would give sample 200 child two-year period , 100 patient group . From postulated secondary infection rate 15 50 % child receive antibiotic , midway point 25 % estimate treatment failure rate placebo group . With information available treatment failure rate active group , failure rate 10 % 5 % arbitrarily apply . With 25 % 5 % treatment failure rate placebo active group respectively , level significance α = 0.05 sample size 100 per group give power 0.98 failure rate 25 % 10 % power 0.80 . Statistical analysis do use IBM SPSS Version 20 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) . Categorical variable express n ( % ) continuous variable median ( interquartile range ( IQR ) ) . A P value ≤ 0.05 consider significant situation . For categorical variable , Fischer 's exact test use small sample less frequent occurrence . Chi-Square test applied large sample frequent occurrence . Mann-Whitney Kruskal-Wallis test use ordinal continuous variable . Significant correlation factor covariates ( Spearman 's rank coefficient ) favour univariate analysis binary logistic regression model determine potential risk factor treatment failure . Continuous variable categorise clinical relevance logistic regression test . In instance , specific clinical parameter report symptom record presence absence risk factor unknown . The miss value , unknown factor flow patient follow-up account total always add full number study participant . In result Day 3 Day 5 post-ingestion , denominator use calculate proportion report symptom include patient attend telephone interviewed , whereas denominator clinical sign patient attend . The primary outcome measure treatment failure , report . Secondary outcome measure length hospital stay , report symptom ( cough , shortness breath , wheeze fever ) clinical sign ( respiratory rate , flaring , recession , grunt , wheeze , crepitation , temperature alter mental status ) follow-up Day 3 5 post-ingestion placebo active group . Further investigation explore role confounding condition ( upper respiratory tract infection , active Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ) risk factor treatment failure delay resolution ( vomit post-ingestion , household smoking contact , HIV exposure status , prior respiratory history , young age etc ) . Secondary outcome measure , confound condition risk factor report Clinical Trials format , report PI 's Master 's thesis . ( Balme KH .
