	<brief_title>Endoprosthesis Treatment Effects Human Abdominal Aorta Aneurysms ( AAA ) Metabolic Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Abdominal Aorta Aneurysm ( AAA ) frequently occur atherothrombotic disease , link male gender age . Due current age population , incidence rupture may increase . The clinical evaluation AAA usually include morphological assessment ( size localization ) diagnosis , open surgery endovascular prosthesis ( EVAR ) may indicate prevent onset rupture often lethal . Unfortunately , durability endovascular repair AAA remain uncertain rupture risk endoleaks onset require continuous surveillance conventional imaging CT scan often fail predict negative progression . Our hypothesis therapeutic efficacity endovascular surgery AAA link restoration effective compartmentalization blood outer wall ( removal thrombosis interface blood pressure constraint ) . Thus , success EVAR must follow disappearance adventitial inflammation visualize metabolic activity FDG-PET ( 18FDG uptake ) normalization biological marker injury . Conversely , inefficacy endovascular therapy result persistence inflammatory metabolic activity relation saccular endoleak persistent elevation plasma biomarkers . Primary objective : The general aim pilot study assess effect endoprosthesis treatment PET scan functional imaging AAA . Materials method : Seven French Hospitals recruit 50 patient present large AAA schedule EVAR ( Endovascular prosthesis ) within one month . A 18FDG PET scan add conventional follow ( CT scan , usual blood sampling , ECGâ€¦ ) i.e . within one month endovascular surgery ( inclusion visit ) , one month 6 month follow-up . Furthermore , biological marker inflammation , proteolysis coagulation potentially related morphology evolution AAA investigate U698 ( National Institute Medical Research ) Unit , implement already exist database others cohorts patient AAA , include biological sample conserve Nancy clinical investigation center ( U698 ) National Institute Medical Research Unit . Study duration patient : 26 month Perspectives : This pilot study help assess effect EVAR term functional inflammatory response determine require sample size future project . Since aneurysm expansion rate varies widely among patient even one single patient time , study metabolic adventitial immuno-inflammatory activity use 18FDG PET image provide new major information efficacity endovascular therapy AAA . Plasma assay help identify intermediate biological marker aneurysm evolutivity endovascular therapy . Those complementary functional biological criterion paramount importance improve therapeutic management prognosis AAA .</detailed_description>
