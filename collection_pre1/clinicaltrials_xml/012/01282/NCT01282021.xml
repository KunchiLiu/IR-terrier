	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy Volunteers great equal 18 year age . Volunteer healthy donor age 18 year live area since birth least 6 7 generation endogenous family region recruit . A detailed ancestral line descent ( pedigree ) mandatory study perform . Individuals reside rural region mostly conserve may possible donor could closely relate . However identify diverse possible potential blood donor avoid dilution ancestral gene blood sample collect individual know reside region generation know closely related . Donors recruit local school , church community organization . The oral consent include question donor ask anyone his/her family also donate sample close relationship . Blood collection first come , first serve basis individual inform one person among close relative include study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals le 18 year age exclude study . The study population study information obtain individual 18 year expect different 18 year old . Also need involve adult consent individual 18 year old would complicate . All donor healthy volunteer individual time sample collection . Any potential donor physical mental disability , individual know infectious and/or noninfectious disease pregnant woman exclude study .</criteria>
