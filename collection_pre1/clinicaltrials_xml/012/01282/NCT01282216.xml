	<brief_summary>This research do understand effect certain type bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) immune system . Your doctor plan BMT , use one family member bone marrow donor , cancer . Part BMT involve chemotherapy drug , call Cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) , give transplant . This research do understand effect Cyclophosphamide immune system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient-donor Vaccination Context Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplant With Post-transplant Cyclophosphamide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research involve give donor vaccine certain infection , bone marrow donation : either vaccine hepatitis ( hepatitis A vaccine ) , vaccine pneumonia ( Prevnar ) . You get vaccine follow transplant . By study much vaccine may improve immune system , hope good understand effect BMT Cyclophosphamide immune cell . Prevnar pneumococcal vaccine ( pneumococcus bacteria cause pneumonia infection ) . It approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) prevention infection child . It usually give adult . Hepatitis A vaccine approve FDA prevention hepatitis A ( liver infection ) child adult . The vaccine approve bone marrow donor vaccinate adult BMT ( use vaccine research investigational ) . The FDA allow use vaccine research study . Certain people get BMT follow Cyclophosphamide may join , donor might also join . Your bone marrow donor must take part study , order continue study</detailed_description>
