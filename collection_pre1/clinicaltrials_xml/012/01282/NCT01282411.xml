	<brief_title>Anatomic Outcomes Following Ozurdex Injections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Focal laser therapy gold standard treatment macular edema secondary branch vein occlusion ( BRVO ) , though show effective central vein occlusion ( CRVO ) . Intravitreal corticosteroid show many case series effective diminish macular edema secondary BRVO CRVO . Sustained drug delivery model seek relieve need frequent injection . Ozurdex recently find effective treatment macular edema follow BRVO CRVO approve FDA indication . The onset effectiveness duration action anatomic thickness retina yet demonstrate . In addition , uncertain clinician label patient responder nonresponder . We also believe study help identify patient may need frequent dose schedule .</detailed_description>
