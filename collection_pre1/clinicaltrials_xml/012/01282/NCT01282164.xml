	<brief_summary>The purpose study find Glucagon Stimulation Test ( GST ) reliable alternative Insulin Tolerance Test ( ITT ) diagnosis Growth Hormone Deficiency ( GHD ) adrenal insufficiency . In patient accuracy GST evaluation adrenal insufficiency compare adrenocorticotropin hormone ( ACTH ) stimulation test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Glucagon Stimulation Test Evaluation Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency Adrenocorticotropic Axis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Growth hormone protein produce pituitary gland influence metabolism ( fast thing work ) proteins , carbohydrate , fat body . This allow growth hormone help human keep healthy balance fat , muscle bone throughout life . Some people call Growth Hormone Deficiency ( GHD ) , mean produce enough growth hormone . GHD may lead tendency fat , ( especially around abdominal area ) , reduce ability exercise , heart disease , increase possibility break bone , general reduce quality life . GHD usually evaluate growth hormone stimulation test ( ) . One reliable test evaluate someone GHD use arginine + Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone ( GHRH ) test . However , Since 2008 GHRH longer available USA . For reason significant gap alternative test evaluation patient suspect GHD easily perform reliable . The Insulin Tolerance Test ( ITT ) generally consider gold standard test evaluation growth hormone ( GH ) deficiency . The ITT involve give insulin intravenously ( plastic tube insert vein ) low blood sugar follow collection blood sample evaluate body handle low blood sugar . There side effect ITT include hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar cause become weak , perspire , shaky mental cloudiness ) unpleasant . ITT perform patient older 65 year age certain medical condition history heart disease , seizure disorder stroke . At time , ITT need do experienced clinician require trained staff perform . For reason need alternative reliable test evaluation GHD . The second purpose study find adrenal insufficiency . Cortisol hormone produce adrenal gland release response stress . Cortisol production regulate hypothalamus pituitary gland . Its primary function increase blood sugar , regulate immune system aid fat , protein carbohydrate metabolism . Patients low cortisol may experience fatigue , body ache , sleep disturbance , nausea mood change . Pituitary disorder may lead low cortisol level cause symptom associate adrenal insufficiency . The Insulin Tolerance Test ( ITT ) also use evaluation adrenal function . Patients undergo ITT , evaluate ACTH ( adrenocorticotropic hormone ) Stimulation Test , generally well tolerate . Preliminary result previous study indicate Glucagon Stimulation Test ( GST ) may use evaluate adrenal function . The investigator study compare cortisol level two different GSTs cortisol level achieve ITT ACTH stimulation test . Since 1970s , Glucagon Stimulation Test ( GST ) use several research study evaluation GHD adrenal insufficiency . Glucagon hormone produce pancreas secrete time low blood sugar response growth hormone . It use raise low blood sugar diagnostic test stomach digestive organ . Glucagon readily available , relatively inexpensive generally well tolerate ; major side effect include upset stomach lead vomit headache . It use patient diabetes old 65 year age . The glucagon stimulation test ( GST ) suggest alternative test ITT evaluation growth hormone deficiency ( GHD ) adrenal insufficiency . The test similar ITT ACTH Stimulation Test blood sample take medication give . Glucagon give intramuscularly ( injection muscle ) . The few side effect make attractive substitute ITT . The 2007 consensus guideline GH Research Society consider GST test may use evaluation patient suspect GHD . However , statement provide diagnostic cut-off value GH GST . The purpose study see GST accurate substitute ITT evaluation GHD adrenal insufficiency .</detailed_description>
