	<brief_title>Encouraging Walking Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study randomize control trial incentive scheme deliver novel internet-based platform promote walk old adult . The four arm consist follow : financial incentive , peer network , combine arm ( financial incentive &amp; peer network ) , control . Participation study last approximately 26 week , include 2-week run-in period , 4-month intervention period , 2-month follow-up period . The primary goal study : 1 . To test effect financial incentive old adult uptake retention increase level walk . Hypothesis1a : Participants receive financial incentive increase number step per day participant receive financial incentive . 2 . To test effect connection new peer network old adult uptake retention increase level walk . Hypothesis 2a : Participants connect new peer network participant increase number step per day participant connect new network . Hypothesis 2b : Participants connect new peer network participant retain increase number step per day participant connect new network . 3 . To test combined effect financial incentive peer network old adult ' uptake retention increase level walk . Hypothesis 3a : Participants receive financial incentive connect peer network increase number step per day participant connect peer network . Hypothesis 3b : Participants receive financial incentive connect peer network effectively maintain increase number step per day compare participant receive financial incentive . 4 . To develop internet , text email messaging , pedometer-internet interface technology build peer network provide regular feedback subject . Hypothesis 4 : The study platform provide effective mechanism subject recruitment , data collection , communication regular feedback .</detailed_description>
