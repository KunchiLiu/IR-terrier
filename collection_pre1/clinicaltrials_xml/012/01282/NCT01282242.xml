	<brief_summary>This study jointly develop jointly lead investigator Massachusetts General Hospital intramural division NINDS . We research study find Activase ® ( also call alteplase rt-PA ) safely give people acute ischemic stroke stroke onset witness make ineligible standard thrombolytic ( clot bust ) therapy . We also want find rt-PA help people recover good stroke . The purpose study : 1 ) see safe give intravenous ( IV ) rt-PA people unwitnessed stroke MRI evidence early ischemic stroke , 2 ) see rt-PA effective give people select treatment base MRI evidence early stroke , 3 ) get information new MRI diagnostic method guide stroke treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study jointly develop jointly lead Massachusetts General Hospital NINDS . This multi-center , open-label , Phase IIa safety study adult acute ischemic stroke patient determine safe extend intravenous thrombolytic treatment subject evaluate within 24 hour last know well ( `` stroke onset '' ) eligible receive thrombolytic treatment within 4.5 hour symptom discovery assistance MRI-based `` witness '' human witness stroke onset available . The study design investigate safety use standard diagnostic MRI selecting patient thrombolytic therapy last know well time place patient beyond current IV thrombolytic time-window .</detailed_description>
