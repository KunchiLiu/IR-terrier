	<brief_summary>Rapid urease test ( RUT ) commonly use biopsy-based method diagnose Helicobacter pylorus ( Hp ) infection simple , rapid accurate character . However , sensitivity report decrease ulcer bleed recently . So important issue avoid false negative test patient . Siddique et al report sensitivity RUT could increase biopsy number increase 1 4 . Other study demonstrate additional biopsy gastric body would increase sensitivity RUT patient ulcer bleed . Therefore , design study see increase number biopsy different location biopsy could increase sensitivity RUT patient gastroduodenal ulcer bleeding . After receive explanation give consent , patient gastric duodenal ulcer bleed diagnose endoscopic examination enrol . Those unstable , receive antibiotic continuous proton pump inhibitor treatment within 4 week , contraindicate endoscopic biopsy exclude . We take 1 piece , 4 piece biopsy sample prepyloric antrum 1 piece gastric body standard biopsy forceps patient agree RUT test . Then , put sample 3 separate RUT kit respectively . We use 13C-UBT gold standard diagnosis Hp infection . It schedule : ( 1 ) condition patient suitable breath test endoscopic examination , 13C-UBT perform within 2 day , ( 2 ) otherwise , perform 1 hour examination . We plan enroll 100 patient study . We apply McNamer 's test examine difference RUT sensitivity different biopsy number . For RUT sensitivity different location , use kappa statistic method analyze consistency .</brief_summary>
