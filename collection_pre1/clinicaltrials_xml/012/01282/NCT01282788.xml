	<brief_summary>Two every three infant rural area Democratic Republic Congo ( DRC ) suffer stunt linear growth 12 month age . Stunting presumably result breast milk supplementation 6 month age complementary food ( CF ) provide inadequate protein micro-nutrients . Although supplementation select micro-nutrients may avoid certain deficiency state , CF animal source food may necessary avoid stunt . Meat readily available many Central African country . However caterpillar , locally available abundant , common staple adult diet may suitable substitute animal source protein CF . The investigator develop cereal make dried caterpillar nutrient content appear ideal CF demonstrate maternal infant acceptability . This study investigate efficacy prevention stunt growth result inadequate complementary food . A sub-study evaluate biologic effect caterpillar cereal determine whether caterpillar cereal prevents iron deficiency anemia , reduce incidence neurodevelopmental impairment infectious disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A randomize , control trial conduct Equateur Province . The study cluster randomize , non-masked control trial daily intake caterpillar cereal ( Cereal Arm ) versus usual diet provide family ( Traditional Diet Arm ) 6 to18 month age . Eight community ( cluster ) randomize either Cereal Arm Traditional Diet Arm study . A community comprise approximately 10 12 rural village serve one Health Center . Each Cereal community pair Traditional Diet community . Educational Information All participant provide general education include : 1 ) critical message infant feed 2 ) instruction hand hygiene food preparation . The primary educator Community Coordinators ( CCs ; specially-trained research nurse ) work Health Center nurse . Messages deliver reinforce pictorial aid . Mothers arm receive three repetitive message reinforce select feature World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommendation complementary feeding : 1 . Feed thicken gruel cereal every day 2 . Feed infant/toddler least 3 time day 3 . Maximize local food diversity Cereal Arm All infant community randomize Cereal Arm receive once-daily serving caterpillar cereal ( 30 g 6-12 month age 45 g 12-18 month age ) . Study food deliver home weekly CCs , also observe feeding cereal home visit . Feedings observe 3x/week first 3 week enrollment , 1x/week 18 month age . Parents care provider receive specific instruction cereal preparation general education feeding practice , food preparation hygiene . This information reinforce weekly visit . Traditional Diet Arm Infants communities randomize Traditional Diet Arm receive food supplement . Parents care provider arm study receive general education feeding practice , food preparation hygiene , weekly reinforcement . Study Population A total 220 infant ( approximately 27 community ; 110 infant arm ) enrol study . Records birth within study community obtain local Health Center record . When infant reach 5 month age , caregiver randomly select infant approach CCs seek consent participation study . They support Provincial Coordinator ( physician oversee community-based study conduct Kinshasa School Public Health-University North Carolina Partnership ) hold group information meeting introduce study community leader .</detailed_description>
