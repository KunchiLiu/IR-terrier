	<brief_title>Multi-Reader Multi-Case Study Identify Uterine Contractions Recorded From Laboring Patients Practicing Clinicians</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SureCALL® EMG Labor Monitor® ( SureCALL® ) transabdominal electromyography monitor intend measure intrapartum uterine activity . It intend use term pregnant woman labor , singleton pregnancy , use surface electrode maternal abdomen . The device intend use healthcare professional clinical setting . This multi-reader multi-case study design evaluate performance SureCALL® predicate Tocodynamometer device ( TOCO ) use performance Intrauterine Pressure Catheter device ( IUPC ) `` gold standard '' . This study involve 20 woman term , labor , three clinical site . Each study subject instrument three technology measure uterine activity : 1. tocodynamometer attach maternal abdomen 2. set abdominal surface electrode uterine electromyography , 3. intrauterine pressure catheter . An assessment obtain quantified mask , qualified clinical obstetrician reader evaluation equivalence three independent labor monitor device identify isolation individual uterine contraction signal peak contraction signal produce full-term patient term labor independently collect labor monitor device .</detailed_description>
