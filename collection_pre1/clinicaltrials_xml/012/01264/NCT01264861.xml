	<brief_summary>This study safinamide , investigational drug Parkinson disease ( PD ) . Safinamide develop add-on therapy treatment Parkinson disease . It theorize safinamide act increase available dopamine area brain dopamine decrease result Parkinson ; Disease . . Dopamine brain involved control body movement . Safinamide extensively study animal , show increase level dopamine animal . Safinamide also test patient Parkinson disease . The goal research trial see safinamide safe well tolerate well understand affect dopamine system brain individual Parkinson disease . Data trial may provide essential information effectiveness safety dos safinamide patient early Parkinson disease , already receive stable dose normal Parkinson disease treatment .</brief_summary>
