	<criteria>Subject must &gt; 21 year age . Subject ability understand cooperate study procedure agree return require followup visit , test exams . Subjects take warfarin may include dosage reduce procedure result International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) 1.5 less . Warfarin may restart therapeutic dose procedure . The subject must sign write informed consent prior procedure , use form approve local medical ethic committee ( EC ) . The life expectancy subject least one year . The subject lesion locate internal carotid artery ( ICA ) ; carotid bifurcation may involve . The subject must minimum distance 5 cm clavicle bifurcation , assess duplex Doppler ultrasound , compute axial tomographic ( CT ) angiography magnetic resonance ( MR ) angiography . The subject participate another investigational trial would interfere conduct result study . The subject dementia neurological illness may confound neurological evaluation . Presence one follow anatomic risk factor : Previous radiation treatment neck radical neck dissection Tracheostomy tracheal stoma Laryngectomy Contralateral laryngeal nerve palsy Severe tandem lesion Inability extend head due cervical arthritis cervical disorder A total occlusion target vessel . There exist , previously place stent target artery . The subject know lifethreatening allergy contrast medium treat . Subject history intolerance allergic reaction study medication include aspirin , Clopidogrel bisulfate ( Plavix® ) Ticlopidine ( Ticlid® ) , heparin Bivalrudin ( Angiomax™ ) . Subject unable tolerate combination aspirin Clopidogrel/Ticlopidine . The subject GI bleed would interfere antiplatelet therapy . The subject know cardiac source potential embolus . Subject Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) level le 8 gm/dL ( unless dialysis ) , platelet count &lt; 50,000/mm3 , know heparin associate thrombocytopenia . Subject document atrial fibrillation 90 day prior procedure . The subject history bleed diathesis coagulopathy include thrombocytopenia inability receive heparin amount sufficient maintain Activated Clot Time ( ACT ) &gt; 250 , refuse blood transfusion . The subject atherosclerotic disease involve ipsilateral common carotid artery preclude safe placement arterial sheath . The subject abnormal angiographic finding indicate subject risk stroke due problem target lesion , : ipsilateral arterial stenosis great severity target lesion , cerebral aneurysm , arteriovenous malformation cerebral vasculature . There evidence carotid artery dissection prior initiation procedure . There angiographically visible thrombus . There condition precludes proper angiographic assessment make percutaneous arterial access unsafe , e.g . morbid obesity , sustain systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mm Hg , tortuosity , occlusive disease , vessel anatomy , aortic arch anatomy , cerebral protective system . Occlusion ( TIMI 0 flow ) , string sign ipsilateral common internal carotid artery . There evidence bilateral carotid stenosis would require intervention within 30 day procedure . There evidence stroke within previous 30 day procedure . There plan treatment nontarget lesion within 30 day post procedure . There history intracranial hemorrhage within previous 3 month , include hemorrhagic transformation ischemic stroke . There history ipsilateral stroke fluctuate neurologic symptom within one year procedure . Female subject pregnant may become pregnant .</criteria>
