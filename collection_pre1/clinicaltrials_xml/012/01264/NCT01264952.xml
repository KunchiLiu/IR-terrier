	<detailed_description>The study conduct patient colorectal cancer synchronous metachronous liver metastasis . Included 10-15 patient . Predominantly , patient synchronous metastasis include study . These patient present liver metastasis time primary tumor resection . Electrochemotherapy perform one metastasis 3 cm large diameter time primary tumor operation , patient least 2 8 metastasis . These metastasis aim resect follow operation . It standard procedure liver metastasis resect 2-3 month primary tumor resection , meantime standard chemotherapeutic protocol ( FOLFOX , FOLFIRI , Capecitabine ) . Only case solitary metastasis small 3 cm diameter , resect resection primary tumor . In study additional antitumor effectiveness electrochemotherapy treatment ( chemotherapy ) evaluate , compare non-electrochemotherapy treated metastasis . Treatment effectiveness evaluate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ultrasonography ( US ) , monthly interval . Two three month first operation treat untreated metastasis resect thorough histological analysis perform . The second group patient metachronous liver metastasis large 3 cm diameter , location vicinity hollow liver structure would possible resect without extensive potentially jeopardize liver resection . One treat electrochemotherapy . In month interval treatment effectiveness evaluate MRI . In case metastasis decrease size situation metastases resectable , second operation perform , metastasis resect thorough histopathological evaluation perform . Otherwise standard treatment procedure perform ( chemotherapy ) . All patient treat procedure thoroughly describe , sign informed consent .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients measurable liver metastasis , present simultaneously primary tumor , aim primary tumor resection 23 month interval resection liver metastasis . One metastasis treat electrochemotherapy , large 3 cm diameter . Metastasis accessible application electrochemotherapy operation , without major liver manipulation mobilization order create situation would hamper feasibility second operation ; resection metastasis . Patients metachronous liver metastasis , position unresectable liver area , near blood vessel , inoperable patient . Recurrent liver metastasis , 3 , large 3 cm diameter . Histologically cytologically confirm cancer , histological differentiation . Life expectancy 3 month . Performance status Karnofsky ≥ 70 ( World Health Organization ) WHO ≥ 2 . Age 18 . The patient must offer standard treatment . Electrochemotherapy offer patient case disease progression standard treatment , case metastasis recurrence , refuse standard treatment . Treatment free interval 25 week , depend drug use . Patient must mentally capable understanding information give . Patient must give informed consent . Metastases 3 cm diameter . Synchronous unresectable metastasis . Metachronous unresectable metastasis big 3 cm diameter . Visceral , bone diffuse metastasis . Coagulation disturbance . Allergic reaction bleomycin , cumulative dose 250 mg/m2 bleomycin receive . Impaired kidney function ( creatinin &gt; 150 µmol/l ) . Patients hearth failure pace maker . Patients epilepsy . Secondary primary tumor , except surgically treat noninvasive cancer cervix , surgically irradiate basal cell carcinoma . Pregnancy .</criteria>
