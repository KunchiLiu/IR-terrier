	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose veliparib give together radiation therapy treat patient advance solid malignancy ( abnormal cell divide without control invade nearby tissue ) peritoneal carcinomatosis , epithelial ovarian , fallopian , primary peritoneal cancer . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell .

	<brief_title>Veliparib Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies With Peritoneal Carcinomatosis , Epithelial Ovarian , Fallopian , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerable dose veliparib combination low-dose fractionated whole abdominal radiation therapy ( LDFWAR ) patient peritoneal carcinomatosis advance solid malignancy . At dose level 5 6 : determine maximum tolerable dose veliparib combination LDFWAR patient epithelial ovarian , fallopian primary peritoneal cancer intraabdominal disease . II . Determine safety toxicity combination veliparib conjunction LDFWAR patient peritoneal carcinomatosis advance solid malignancy ; dose level 5 6 : determine safety toxicity veliparib combination LDFWAR patient epithelial ovarian , fallopian primary peritoneal cancer intraabdominal disease . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess clinical activity veliparib plus LDFWAR patient peritoneal carcinomatosis advance solid malignancy assess response rate Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion . At dose level 5 6 : assess clinical activity veliparib plus LDFWAR patient epithelial ovarian , fallopian primary peritoneal cancer intraabdominal disease assess response rate RECIST 1.1 criterion . II . Evaluate microsatellite instability baseline level various deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair protein ( excision repair cross-complementing 1 [ ERCC1 ] , x-ray repair complement defective repair Chinese hamster cell 1 [ XRCC1 ] , breast cancer 1 , early onset [ BRCA1 ] , breast cancer 2 , early onset [ BRCA2 ] , poly [ adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) -ribosyl ] ation [ PAR ] ) correlate clinical activity regimen . III . Evaluate change quality life patient treat regimen serial measurement use Quality Life Questionnaire Core-30 ( QLQC-30 ) standardize questionnaire . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study veliparib . Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 ( day 5-21 course 1 ) . Patients undergo LDFWAR BID day 1 5 week 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
