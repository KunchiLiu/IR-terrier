	<brief_title>The Benefit Arthroscopic Partial Meniscectomy Middle-Aged Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Osteoarthritis ( OA ) common form arthritis affect 4.5 % Danish population . The knee one affect joint 45 % OA-related hospital contact relate knee . OA long 'pre-clinical ' phase joint change without symptom . Then come symptomatic phase pain functional limitation . This sometimes accompanied structural change visible plain X-ray examination pathological change like focal area damage articular cartilage , center load-bearing area . After , new bone formation joint margin ( osteophytosis ) develop along change subchondral bone , variable degree mild synovitis , thicken joint capsule . The meniscus play important role development osteoarthritis . Meniscus tear risk factor knee OA well sign disease . Both meniscus injury meniscectomy contribute development knee OA . The surgical removal damage part meniscus tear put knee high risk later develop OA . Surgical resection also lead increase joint cartilage contact stress alter load transmission , decrease shock absorption , decrease joint stability . The current standard treatment degenerative meniscus tear arthroscopic partial meniscectomy ( APM ) . Arthroscopic surgery one frequent orthopaedic procedure approximately 10,000 APM procedure do per year Denmark . The benefit APM procedure , however , uncertain need investigate . As mention , significantly increase risk develop knee OA . The investigator also know significant placebo effect present arthroscopic knee surgery include APM procedure . It furthermore show patient degenerative meniscus tear recover without surgery exercise alone , . The recovery period APM procedure also much long surgeon realize , disability still evident 3 month . The investigator need investigate placebo effect young patient degenerative meniscus tear without knee OA implement additional well-designed , randomize , placebo control trial reveal true effect APM procedure short-and long-term basis . The benefit , short- long term basis APM firstly describe non-controlled study 1980-90 's . , , arthroscopic surgery gain entry . But poorly design study ( retrospective , use non-validated outcome score , small patient population ) lack randomised study show true effect APM procedure . A Cochrane review 2000 ( withdrawn due age ) conclude : '' â€¦lack randomise trial mean conclusion draw issue surgical versus non-surgical treatment meniscus injury '' . This point study show positive benefit APM compare treatment modality . Those study exist beyond point ( Moseley 2003 , Herrlin 2007 , Kirkley 2008 ) show APM good treatment ( placebo , physiotherapy , medication exercise ) . The patient though study older age ( mean 52 62 year ) already develop symptomatic knee OA . There one study recent age non-surgical treatment meniscus tear young patient ( n32 ) recommend initial course non-operative treatment . The investigator wish examine whether condition applies elder patient knee OA also apply young patient without knee OA . A mathematical model propose identify patient receive benefit APM procedure , accord author , RCT would controversial reluctance lack equipoise surgeon patient . Meanwhile several editorial suggest use sham procedure play large role orthopaedic surgery research , , . Furthermore , recent study vertebroplasty show need placebo-controlled surgical trial avoid widespread adoption new unnecessary intervention routine care . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The first thought come many people introduce protocol : `` Is ethical perform placebo-controlled RCTs surgery ? However , initial precept medicine `` First , harm '' . For example , one imagine new pharmaceutical product market without compare placebo least similar drug . The investigator assume process undertaken , spite likely adverse effect drug . An equally valid question , 'Is ethical perform placebo-controlled RCTs within orthopaedics instead , potentially perform under-researched operation may benefit patient , actually , harm ? ' As mention earlier , recent study vertebroplasty effectively show placebo-controlled surgical trial evaluate give procedure adopt widely despite absence robust evidence . There three reason perform another placebo-controlled arthroscopy study apart Moseley 's ( 2003 ) . First , study focus young patient , second patient yet develop knee OA risk , third , replication study require make Moseley 's evidence convincing . A multistep process propose ensure sham-controlled surgical trial perform ethical manner : 1 . There scepticism regard therapeutic merit particular surgical treatment 2 . There disagreements perceived benefit particular procedure compare placebo . 3 . Benefits might due `` experience surgery '' postoperative care regimen . 4 . Risks reduce far possible sham surgery arm without compromise trial design . 5 . There lack superior alternative therapy . Using model , study would follow basis : Ad 1 ) The APM procedure controversial . The investigator know lead knee OA . Substantial disability show APM procedure . Ad 2 ) Earlier study show significant placebo effect arthroscopic surgery knee OA . Other study show difference surgical non-surgical treatment degenerative meniscus tear . Ad 3 ) As show patient recover even degenerative meniscus tear mechanical symptom suggest benefit surgical intervention due `` experience surgery '' usual postoperative regime . Ad 4 ) The risk minimize skin incision general anaesthesia . The overall complication risk knee arthroscopy 0.5 % . Only relatively healthy patient eligible outpatient surgery include avoid increase risk anaesthesia . Ad 5 ) Alternative therapies medical treatment and/or exercise , literature yet show superiority APM procedure . PURPOSE The overall purpose study test whether benefit APM patient age 35-55 knee pain meniscus lesion , due surgery placebo effect . Demonstration additional benefit surgery may reduce development surgically-related osteoarthritis middle-aged patient . The investigator hypothesize benefit arthroscopic partial meniscectomy measure self-reported outcome due placebo effect , meniscectomy contributes development knee osteoarthritis see radiography . PROJECT DESIGN The study design prospective double-blinded randomize placebo-controlled multicentre trial . Patients randomize receive either APM placebo ( sham ) procedure . The patient furthermore stratify without mechanical symptom . Patients refer general practitioner screen initially . If eligible , write information study include 10 minute video give patient view home . They also hand questionnaire fill home . At second contact patient receive MRI scan affect knee perform physical function test . After patient informed MR finding . If MRI confirm medial meniscus lesion patient include study sign surgery . At 3 month , patient call follow-up include physical function test , objective examination request fill questionnaire . At 2 year , new follow-up take place condition . Postoperative regime All patient intervention group give folder include exercise program postoperative patient knee arthroscopy . The folder give presentation 7 different non-weight bearing exercise ( first week surgery ) 3 weight bearing exercise thereafter . The exercise patient carry home . The patient also recommend start unload cycling , swim walk 1 week 2-3 week patient recommend jogging load cycling . Considerations regard anaesthesia : In study patient give general anaesthesia . Considerations minimize patient risk placebo group either induce deep sedation general anaesthesia . In Moseley 's study patient placebo group sedate minimize risk . This lot like endoscopy setting , use deep sedation Propofol wider use . In set goal complete procedure without need anesthesiologist thus reduce cost procedure . There still complication associate deep sedation . No study exist compare complication risk general anaesthesia deep sedation , incidence complication deep sedation endoscopy set compare general anaesthesia arthroscopy set seem . In study account cost procedure risk patient . Therefore general anaesthesia superior airway control versus deep sedation also risk compromise study design choose . A surgical checklist previously show decrease mortality use patient study insure safety . An attend anesthesiologist responsible anesthesia either directly supervisor . All patient fully sedate Ultiva/Propofol larynx mask apply . The overall risk death anesthesia 1:250.00 healthy patient Denmark 3 death per year report due anesthesia There 3 reason regional anesthesia chosen . First , blind patient much difficult awake , due manipulation knee , time perspective none less `` act '' operational staff require . Second , outpatient clinic Hospital South , Region Zealand offer regional anesthesia moment . Third , study design may compromise non-homogenous group patient receive different kind anesthesia . Studies show though regional anesthesia preferable option outpatient arthroscopic surgery show less healthy individual . Patient characteristic baseline At baseline , registration gender , weight , height , work status level education collect . After surgery patient ask procedure think . Likewise patient asked expectation surgical procedure afterwards expectation fulfil . A questionnaire patient self-efficacy modify Danish Arthritis Self-Efficacy Score include . Objective subjective mechanical finding ( decreased range motion , click , lock ) register . All patient receive : 1 . A clinical examination ( joint line tenderness , range motion , swell , mechanical finding , McMurray test ) 2 . Weight-bearing x-rays knee 3 . MRI affect knee 4 . A functionality test 5 . Questionnaires ( see `` Outcome '' ) RADIOLOGY All MRI 's conduct location review radiologist . A meniscus tear , maceration , and/or destruction grade accord Whole-Organ MRI Score ( WORMS ) method ( 28 ) . The anterior horn , body segment , posterior horn medial lateral meniscus grade separately scale 0-4 , 0 = intact , 1 = minor radial parrot-beak tear , 2 = non-displaced tear ( break 2 surface ) , 3 = displace tear partial maceration destruction , 4 = complete maceration destruction . The reader regard increase intra-meniscus signal ( often linear signal within meniscus ) meniscus tear communicate inferior superior margin meniscus least 2 slice . X-ray knee patient stand take fixed flexion angle use Synarflexer . Classification osteoarthrosis accord Kellgren-Lawrence classification : Grade 0 No radiographic finding osteoarthritis Grade 1 Minute osteophyte doubtful clinical significance Grade 2 Definite osteophyte unimpaired joint space Grade 3 Definite osteophyte moderate joint space narrow Grade 4 Definite osteophyte severe joint space narrow subchondral sclerosis All patient ask reason participate study , decline , either case ask material helpful make decision ( write information , video ) reason choice ( e.g . want contribute research , want sham procedure etc. ) . PHYSICAL FUNCTION TEST Single leg hop test The investigator include single leg hop test , one-leg hop . Subjects perform 2 practice trial two test trial leg . The best two test trial use . Symmetry index calculate one-leg hop test ( injure side/uninjured side ) x 100 . Knee-bending test The investigator also include maximum number knee-bends perform 30 second third test physical function . This test use similar patient group study , , find reliable test . Muscle strength test A handheld dynamometer ( Powertrack Commander ) use evaluate quadriceps muscle performance measure knee-extension strength . Isometric muscle test commonly use literature reliability isometric muscle test hand hold dynamometer previously report satisfactory . Prior muscle functional test , subject warm stationary bicycle approximately 10 minute . The responsible test facilitator blind knee affect led patient wear neoprene sleeve knee . In order decide leg test first patient randomize visit avoid bias effect learn . ADVERSE EVENTS All complication adverse event associate intervention register ; Infection ( deep superficial ) , deep-vein thrombosis , nerve vessel injury compartment syndrome . An adverse event define unwanted event . A serious adverse event define event could lead : 1 . Death 2 . A threat life 3 . Hospitalization 4 . Some form handicap 5 . Congenital defect 6 . A significant medical condition Expected adverse event : Superficial infection , Nerve vessel injury , Deep infection , Compartment syndrome , Deep venous thrombosis , Myocardial infarction , Stroke , Death . All adverse event ( include anticipate table ) gather journal review , national database index follow-ups 3 24 month . SAMPLE SIZE This base superiority study . A sample size calculation do use standard formula . SD , standard deviation define 15 , order make study comparable study use KOOS score . Z , standard normal distribution probability Type I ( 0.05 ) Type II error ( usually 0.05 0.20 . Here decide 0.1 = power 90 % . D clinical importance relevant difference . In calculation 10/100 point KOOS questionnaire subscales choose clinical important relevant difference . Based forty patient need group . With expect drop-out rate 20 % , investigator intend recruit 50 patient group result total 100 patient . RANDOMIZATION The investigator use computer-generated randomization schedule annotation treatment accord meniscectomy ( A ) placebo ( B ) use . To ensure equal distribution two group , investigator use block randomization , use block 4 6 . Participants stratify treatment center . To ensure concealment assign intervention , surgeon obtain sealed envelope contain participant 's assign intervention patient operate suite fully sedate . The envelope retrieve briefcase locate actual operating theatre . The allocation sequence generate external co-investigator , enrollment perform author assignment operate room envelope open surgeon . The treat surgeon role trial . BLINDING The RCT double-blinded study . All study personnel participant blind intervention except surgeon , role study external statistician present unblinded data . STATISTICAL METHOD All subject assign treatment include efficacy analysis ( i.e . intention treat analysis ) . Between-group comparison primary end point make use random effect model . 10/100 point KOOS questionnaire subscales choose clinical important relevant difference , thus confidence interval exclude difference great 10 unit group interpret indicate absence clinically meaningful difference .</detailed_description>
