	<brief_summary>Background : - Bronchiectasis type lung condition lung airways abnormally stretch widen . This stretch widening make difficult mucus substance move lung , encourage growth bacteria lead breathe problem infection . Bronchiectasis cause genetic disorder diseases tuberculosis rheumatoid arthritis . Researchers interested develop good way diagnose treat lung problem call idiopathic unexplained bronchiectasis . Objectives : - To good describe physical characteristic , radiographic pattern , airway microbiology unexplained bronchiectasis look possible genetic link risk factor . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age chronic cough CT scan reveal sign bronchiectasis . - Current smoker smoke least 10 year , well individual know cause bronchiectasis organ transplant , eligible participate . Design : - Participants one outpatient clinic visit evaluation physical examination include detailed body size measurement medical history collection blood sample routine lab test genetic analysis chest x-ray recent one available . - Participants also test lung function , measurement gas call nitric oxide nose . Participants whose initial test show abnormal result may also ask nasal scrape collect cell sample and/or skin sweat test measure salt concentration . - Participants also sputum specimen collect visit ask collect two additional early morning sputum sample mouth rinse home within 2 week clinic visit , mail sample collection material research team ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Genetic Disorders Mucociliary Clearance Consortium ( GDMCC ) comprise 6 geographically-dispersed clinical research site design study chronic disorder conduct airway associate bronchiectasis . The first Clinical Center protocol ( 06-I-0217 ) focus airway disease know genetic etiology : primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) , variant cystic fibrosis ( vCF ) , pseudohypoaldosteronism ( PHA ) . This second GDMCC protocol study adult patient non-CF , idiopathic bronchiectasis , whose genetic etiology know . Patients receive level rigorous test allow proper diagnosis patient PCD , vCF , PHA . Idiopathic bronchiectasis reportedly common female certain asthenic morphotypes associate environmental organism , nontuberculous mycobacterium ( NTM ) . Gender predilection due referral bias unclear . Other susceptibility factor predispose bronchiectasis acquisition NTM also unclear . The study attempt broaden understand disease compare gender-associated factor NTM status . A relatively equal number females/males NTM/non-NTM infected subject accrue . Patients stratify gender presence/absence respiratory infection NTM . Approximately 300 people may screen find 260 eligible subject since small number ( e.g. , 40 patient ) may diagnose PCD , vCF , know etiology explanation bronchiectasis . This single-visit protocol use systematic approach characterize clinical , morphological , radiological , microbiological phenotype idiopathic bronchiectasis . Physical feature , radiographic pattern , associate low airway microbial flora assess . There natural history disease course follow-up component protocol . The standard evaluation include quantitative assessment body morphometrics , functional assessment pulmonary physiology , nasal nitric oxide measurement subsequent detail assessment ciliary structure motility select patient , quantitative immunoglobulin level screen humoral immune defect , select genetic analysis candidate allele , CFTR A1AT . Genotype/phenotype correlation research possibly define . Careful evaluation characterization phenotype guide genetic characterization idiopathic bronchiectasis , likely lead improve diagnostic approach . Identification disease cause gene may provide new therapeutic target .</detailed_description>
