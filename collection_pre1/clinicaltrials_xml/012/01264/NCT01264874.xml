	<detailed_description>Cancer chemoprevention use natural , synthetic , biologic chemical agent reverse , suppress , prevent carcinogenic progression ( Sporn MB Cancer Res 1976 ) . Genetic change exist throughout field increase likelihood one premalignant malignant lesion may develop within field . Multistep carcinogenesis describes stepwise accumulation alteration , genotypic phenotypic . Arresting one several step may impede delay development cancer . Several epidemiological , pre-clinical clinical study support Vitamin D preventive therapeutic cancer agent , wide spectrum cancer . Calcitriol ( 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [ 1,25 ( OH ) D ] ) , hormonal derivative vitamin D , establish since 1980s antiproliferative prodifferentiation agent , proapoptotic agent inhibitor cell migration , may imply inhibitory effect cancer . Vitamin D like hormone strictly vitamin accord classical criterion essential nutrient substance body synthesise sufficient quantity . Also , vitamin usually involved biochemical reaction , 1_,25-dihydroxyvitamin D exert action via VDR . Vitamin D group fat-soluble prohormones , two major form vitamin D2 ( ergocalciferol ) vitamin D3 ( cholecalciferol ) . Endogenous synthesis vitamin D3 take place skin influence ultra violet B ( UVB ) radiation . Exogenous vitamin D2 D3 come dietary intake . The overall vitamin D intake sum cutaneous vitamin D nutritional vitamin D D. Vitamin D physiological action . To physiologically active , vitamin D must first hydroxylated liver enzyme 25-hydroxylase , encoded CYP27A1 ( also call 25-hydroxylase ) 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D ) . The 25-hydroxyvitamin D inactive , additional hydroxylation kidney enzyme 1_-hydroxylase , encode CYP27B1 , ( also call 1_-hydroxylase ) necessary production physiologically active vitamin D metabolite , 1_,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ( calcitriol ) . When 1,25 ( OH ) D sufficiently available , enzyme mitochondrial protein encode CYP24A1 metabolise 1_,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 1_,24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D , catabolise calcitroic acid . 25 ( OH ) D 1,25 ( OH ) 2D transport serum vitamin D-binding protein ( gene name : GC , group-specific component ) . Ahn systematically investigate association 48 SNPS four vitamin D metabolizing gene ( CYP27A1 , GC , CYP27B1 , CYP24A1 ) serum 25 ( OH ) D level . Four tagSNPS GC , major serum 25 ( OH ) D carrier , associate 25 ( OH ) D level ( Ahn et al.Carcinogenesis 2009 ) . CYP24A1 encode member cytochrome P450 superfamily enzymes . The cytochrome P450 proteins monooxygenases catalyze many reaction involve drug metabolism synthesis cholesterol , steroids lipid . This mitochondrial protein initiate degradation 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D hydroxylation side chain . In regulate level vitamin D , enzyme play role calcium homeostasis vitamin D endocrine system . Of interest , epigenetic silencing CYP24A1 , overexpressed many cancer , tumour-derived endothelial cell render tumour sensitive anti-angiogenic effect 1,25 ( OH ) D. Various molecule inhibit 24-Ohase . These merit exploration development specific small molecule 24-OHase inhibitor , especially combination 1,25 ( OH ) D vitamin D analogue . These may maximize intracellular 1,25 ( OH ) D content exert optimal antiproliferative effect ( Deeb 2007 ; Mantell 2000 ; Nishimura 1994 ) . Binding 1,25 ( OH ) D vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) suppress proliferation induces differentiation cancer cell tumour tissue , suggest high level vitamin D metabolite may protective cancer ( Deeb 2007 ; Reichel 1989 ) .</detailed_description>
