	<brief_summary>This study compare effect two dos exercise energy intake body weight . The comparison three group ; two exercise group control group . The exercise group provide dietary intervention study design also include non-exercise control group . E-Mechanic trial make important contribution understanding role exercise dose weight management . While accepted regular exercise play important role general health , exact role exercise prevention weight gain , weight loss prevention weight regain remain poorly understood despite exercise widely prescribe purpose . The idea current weight management exercise recommendation may produce increase energy intake ( forms compensation ) result disappointing weight loss important public health issue . The finding study could help shape future exercise weight loss recommendation treatment plan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose E-MECHANIC Trial test effect two dos exercise energy intake , body weight , body composition , activity level , metabolic rate . The exercise dose reflect current recommendation : 1 ) general health ( 8 KKW ) , 2 ) weight loss ( 20 KKW ) . A non-exercise control group also recruit . The primary outcome variable : 1 ) energy intake , 2 ) discrepancy expect weight loss observe weight loss . Energy intake measure use doubly label water laboratory-based food intake test . Secondary outcome variable include rest metabolic rate , activity level ( exclude structure exercise ) , body composition . Following comprehensive baseline assessment , participant randomly assign 8 KKW , 20 KKW , control group 1:1:1 ratio . Additional assessment conduct week 4 , another comprehensive assessment week 24 . The week 4 assessment important determine endpoint change short-term , long-term .</detailed_description>
