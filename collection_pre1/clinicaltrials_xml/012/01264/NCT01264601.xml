	<brief_summary>Historically , provide influenza vaccination egg allergic child young adult ( EAC ) history anaphylaxis egg , severe symptom allergic reaction egg ( e.g. , severe hive , swell , asthma ) , contra-indicated , though vaccination child less severe egg allergy show safe . Though many child severe egg allergy , include anaphylaxis , receive past influenza vaccination anecdotally , data exist show procedure safe . The investigator propose double blind , placebo-controlled randomize , prospective multi-centered study ) demonstrate seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine ( TIV ) safely give single dose ( opposed 2-step grade dose 10 % 90 % vaccine dose ) EAC despite history anaphylaxis previous severe allergic reaction egg ; b ) provide evidence adverse outcomes related ovalbumin ( egg ) content TIV . Study participant must document history severe egg allergy , substantiate history clinical reactivity AND either positive skin test ImmunoCAP/RAST test great 0.7 kUA/L . Participants randomize receive either 2-step graded challenge single dose give small placebo dose saline ( mimic grade challenge ) . If require , participant receive booster vaccination single dose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Seasonal Trivalent Influenza Vaccine ( TIV ) grown embryonated chicken egg , since contains residual egg protein ( ovalbumin ) , provide TIV egg allergic child ( EAC ) could potentially provoke allergic reactivity . Because possibility , historically caution advise provide TIV child , vaccine withhold certain individual , though many safely administer vaccine skin test stepwise administration . In 2009 American Academy Pediatrics Red Book ( previous edition ) , history severe allergic reactivity egg contraindication receive TIV , though acknowledge less severely egg allergic kid safely receive TIV precaution take . In past year , several study emerge demonstrate , , EAC safely vaccinate TIV ad H1N1 vaccine . A recent 5 year review TIV administration EAC age 6 mo-36 mo , show safe administration 135 EAC TIV skin testing , include 14 subject history anaphylaxis egg . Another large , retrospective study non-anaphylactic EAC show TIV could successfully administer use 2-step protocol without skin test TIV . In single center H1N1 vaccine study last fall , 105 EAC receive either full vaccine dose skin test negative , 2-step graded challenge test positive , include 25 subject history anaphylaxis . No allergic reaction result , regardless result skin testing , method administration , ovalbumin content vaccine , use different booster lot without pre-testing . In sister-study , 68 H1N1 participant prospectively receive TIV safely without graded challenge , include 13 EAC history egg anaphylaxis . A large prospective , Canadian multi-centered study , use adjuvanted H1N1 preparation contain 0.03Î¼g/mL ovalbumin , safely give 72 individual either history severe cardiopulmonary reactivity egg history poorly control asthma ( group break ) , via 2-step graded challenge . Thus , study suggest safe EAC history anaphylaxis receive TIV H1N1 without pre-testing , suggest use 2-step graded challenge may unnecessary , show evidence past egg allergy severity may important factor vaccine tolerance . Recent guideline publish AAAAI suggest flexible approach reasonable , EAC receive TIV without prior skin test either single dose 2-step approach . This double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , multi-centered study aim investigate safety TIV give EAC history severe past reaction anaphylaxis egg , aim show single dose route administration safe sufficient . Participants new establish severe egg allergy ( see eligibility criterion ) randomize receive either 2-step ( 10 % , follow 30 min . observation , residual 90 % ) grade challenge single dose TIV give 30 minute placebo dose normal saline administer ( approximate grade challenge ) . Vaccine tolerance analyze compare ovalbumin content vaccine lot , well baseline characteristic participant 's egg allergy allergic history .</detailed_description>
