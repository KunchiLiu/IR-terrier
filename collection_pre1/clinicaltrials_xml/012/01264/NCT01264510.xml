	<brief_summary>A bone-anchored hearing aid ( Baha ) consist titanium implant locate mastoid , sound processor connect implant . The sound processor delivers bone conduct stimuli cochlea , bypass outer middle ear . Some patient unable wear benefit conventional air-conduction hearing aid , candidate Baha . Typically , patient suffer conductive mixed hearing loss . Recently however , Baha 's also recommended patient unilateral deafness . Sound come deaf side capture transmitted bone conduction normal inner ear . The overall benefit Baha difficult ass patient . Therefore , goal current study examine benefit Baha patient different audiological profile ( unilateral bilateral conductive mixed hearing loss , unilateral deafness ) . Special attention give predictive determinant benefit Baha , improvement pre-operative criterion counsel patient .</brief_summary>
