	<brief_summary>Background : - Studies melanoma tumor sample show tumor cell approximately 20 percent melanoma patient contain specific mutation gene involve make protein call ERBB4 , change gene associated cancer . Lapatinib , drug currently approve treatment breast cancer , show laboratory significantly slow growth melanoma cell contain specific ERBB4 gene mutation . Researchers interested determine whether lapatinib effective melanoma individual ERBB4 mutation . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness lapatinib treatment melanoma ERBB4 mutation respond standard therapy . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age stage 4 melanoma respond standard therapy . Design : - Participants screen full physical examination medical history , well test tumor tissue take previous surgery biopsies new biopsy conduct start study . Test result determine eligibility available within 2 week . - Participants take four lapatinib tablet daily ( two morning , 1 hour breakfast two evening , 1 hour dinner ) every 28-day cycle treatment . Participants keep medication diary record tablets take side effect medication . - After first 2 week , every 2 4 week afterward first 12 week , participant clinic visit blood sample test determine lapatinib cause disease shrink control . If disease progress , participant continue receive new lapatinib supply every 28 day 2 year ( 27 cycle ) , continue regular clinic visit monitor progress treatment . - When tumor tissue easily accessible easily biopsied , researcher collect two additional biopsy , one 2 week treatment one 12 week treatment ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib Stage IV Melanoma With ERBB4 Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Patients stage IV melanoma available treatment option overall poor prognosis . - Pre-clinical evidence suggest lapatinib activity metastatic melanoma harbor ERBB4 mutation . Objectives : Primary Objectives : -Determine response rate lapatinib administer 500 mg orally twice daily continuous schedule patient metastatic melanoma harbor ERBB4 mutation . Secondary Objectives : - To determine progression free survival patient stage IV melanoma treat lapatinib monotherapy . - To evaluate safety lapatinib patient metastatic melanoma - To determine impact additional genetic alteration response lapatinib melanoma harbor ERBB4 mutation - To develop clinically applicable biomarker predictive response lapatinib patient melanoma harbor ERBB4 mutation - To determine pharmacokinetics lapatinib administer 500 mg orally twice daily continuous schedule patient metastatic melanoma harbor ERBB4 mutation Eligibility : - Patients great equal 18 year age stage IV melanoma , measurable disease whose tumor express two ERBB4 gene mutation . - Patient must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 1 life expectancy 3 month . - Patients must adequate organ function . - Patients must surgery , chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiation therapy , biological therapy least 4 week prior start study medication . - Patients must acute , critical illness . - All patient sexually active able conceive require use contraception treatment lapatinib . Design : - Patients screen presence ERBB4 gene mutation tumor patient harbor less equal 2 ERBB4 mutation enrol treatment phase study . - Lapatinib administer oral dose 500 mg twice daily ( morning evening ) take one hour meal . Lapatinib give continuously ; one cycle equal 28 day . Course 1 equal cycle 1 ; subsequent course 8 week long ( 2 cycle ) . A patient may receive 27 cycle ( 14 course ) . - Up 25 patient ( allow stag accrual initially 16 patient receive lapatinib evaluable 1st cycle ) enrol 2-3 year trial complete 3-5 year , allow completion follow-up . - The primary objective trial determine whether lapatinib monotherapy set able associate response rate ( Partial Response ( PR ) + Complete Response ( CR ) ) rule 10 % ( p0=0.10 ) favor improve response rate 30 % ( p1=0.30 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically confirm stage IV cutaneous melanoma . Patients must measurable disease define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 . Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) . Each lesion must great 10 mm measure compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) caliper measurement clinical exam ; great 20 mm measure chest xray . Lymph node must great 15 mm short axis measure CT MRI . Patients must two oncogenic somatic ERBB4 mutation detect one 28 exon ERBB4 gene analyze tumor present match normal deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) confirm sequence analysis tumor genomic DNA derive biopsy specimen obtain participate clinical site . Sequence analysis perform National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Molecular Profiling Core , Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) certify laboratory . Note : Patients 3 mutation ERBB4 gene may increase resistance lapatinib eligible lapatinib treatment Patients must chemotherapy , molecular therapy BRAF , mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEK ) , ckit inhibitor , hormonal therapy , radiation therapy , biological therapy least 4 week prior start study medication . Patients receive mitomycin C , nitrosoureas , anticytotoxic Tlymphocyte antigen 4 ( CTLA4 ) , carboplatin must 6 week last administration therapy . Patients must recover acute toxicity relate prior therapy surgery , grade 1 less unless specify . Patients 3 intracranial metastasis , definitively treat surgery radiation therapy may eligible study provide evidence active disease least 2 month requirement anticonvulsant therapy steroid follow treatment . Age great equal 18 year . Note : Because dose adverse event data currently available use lapatinib patient less 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric singleagent trial , applicable . Life expectancy great 3 month . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 1 ( Karnofsky great equal 70 % ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL platelet great equal 100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ( serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) ) /alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ( serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) ) less equal 3 time institutional upper limit normal creatinine less equal institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . Patients must willing return Clinic followup visit . Women childbearing potential must negative betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) ( serum urine ) within 14 day prior study treatment must willing practice effective birth control prevent pregnancy receive treatment four month treatment discontinue . All male child father potential must also willing practice effective birth control . Note : Lapatinib tyrosine kinase inhibitor potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother lapatinib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated lapatinib . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , patient inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign Informed Consent Document .
