	<brief_title>Identification Microcirculation Inflammation After Minimal-invasive Osteosynthesis Proximal Femur</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project investigate microcirculation skin muscle different surgical treatment pertrochanteric fracture femur detect less damaging method . Three different system compare : PCCT osteosynthesis nail ( two minimal-invasive method ) conventional dynamic hip screw ( DHS ) . All three long establish show difference result clinical trial . The method every patient choose randomly . The microcirculation measure parameter tissue damage wind heeling . It register O2c , work measure reflect lightwaves . It strictly noninvasive cause absolutely pain patient . The measurement device consist two small probe , simply stick patientÂ´s skin . There eleven measurement study : one directly one shortly one 6 h surgery , follow three measure appointment 12 , 24 , 48 hour . Afterwards appointment plan 4 , 7 12 day . After 7 day CT control leg-rotation . In addition detects dislocation fracture fix item.The next appointment plan 6 week . In last two session patient question accord establish questionnaire , e.g Harris hip score evaluate loss functionality operate leg . And control physical strength plan appointment . It known today patient reach level physical strength treatment fracture . Additionally EMG record muscle damage . And level pain evaluate Visual Analogue Scale simultaneity O2c-measurements . The last measurement plan 6 month . Then fracture control X-ray . Clinical parameter like operation time , blood loss , ASA score ( pre-existing condition ) include create comparable patient profile . Therefore AO classification fracture grade osteoporosis accord Singh-Classification record , . Also every measuring appointment blood sample test parameter systemic inflammatory response muscle cell destruction . Furthermore project mean establish limit microcirculation measure O2c . So future possible predict wound heel difficulty no-invasive measuring technic . Therefore study research one hand three operation method differ wound heeling , functionality level pain hand establish possibility detect wound heel complication early easily . Both result extremely relevant able choose treatment suit individual patient . So pertrochanteric fracture femur , common old multimorbid population , long result risky re-operations due wound heel complication limited functionality quality life .</detailed_description>
