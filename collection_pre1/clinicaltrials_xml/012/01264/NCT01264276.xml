	<brief_summary>The primary objective multi-center clinical study evaluate validity , reliability , feasibility , safety relative cost-effectiveness retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) telemedicine evaluation system detect eye at-risk baby meet referral warrant ROP ( RW-ROP ) criterion therefore need diagnostic evaluation ophthalmologist experience ROP . We shall : 1 . Calculate accuracy , use sensitivity specificity , system provide remote evaluation compare finding `` gold standard '' indirect ophthalmoscopic examination perform Study-certified ophthalmologist , rigorously train ROP diagnostic examination ( validity ) ; 2 . Determine intra-reader inter-reader agreement decide whether digital image indicate eye baby need diagnostic indirect ophthalmoscopy ophthalmologist experience ROP ( reliability ) ; 3 . Determine whether image evaluation achieve baby ( feasibility ) ; 4 . Examine ocular systemic complication associate digital imaging compare associate diagnostic examination perform ophthalmologist ( safety ) ; 5 . Compare cost benefit adopt telemedicine retinal imaging system compare current cost indirect ophthalmoscopic examination ( cost-effectiveness ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligibility Criteria : • Babies birth weight &lt; 1251 gram ( g ) select large clinical center US Canada . Procedures : • Participants undergo digital retinal imaging clinically indicate indirect ophthalmoscopic examination day . Wide-field digital image ( WF-DI ) eye capture non-physician Certified ROP Imagers ( CRIs ) use standardize imaging protocol . The RetCam Shuttle® ( Clarity Medical Systems , Pleasanton , CA ) , corneal-contact camera capture wide field ( 130 degree field view ) retinal image , use . Masking : • Study-certified Ophthalmologist Study-certified Imager clinical site mask 's finding . The Study Clinical Coordinator ( SCC ) remain unmasked . SCC monitor clinical noteworthy event report adverse event site Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , Project Director Office Study Chair , Data Coordinating Center ( DCC ) . DCC prepare closed-session Data Monitoring Oversight Committee ( DMOC ) report . The PI site monitor adverse event . Outcome Measures : • The primary outcome measure detection referral warrant ROP ( RW-ROP ) digital image . Retinal image grade Trained Readers use standardize protocol identify eyes RW-ROP . Results grading compare diagnostic examination perform child session image take . For comparison , image also grade ROP expert ( Expert Readers ) .</detailed_description>
