	<brief_summary>Vernal keratoconjunctivitis ( VKC ) bilateral , chronic , external ocular inflammatory disease unknown cause . It fairly common disease hot , dry environment , represent much 3 % severe ophthalmic disease 33 % eye pathology see among young patient eye clinic Central Africa . Symptoms sign persist year important visual morbidity social impact . Corneal change ( e.g . corneal ulcer ) sight threaten , occur 10 % VKC child . Topical steroid therapy remain current standard treatment , develop country use often chronic medically supervise , potentially lead bacterial infection , steroid-induced glaucoma cataract . Chromoglycate drop less side effect lack power control flare-up . Topical cyclosporine potential offer efficient safer alternative steroid drop management VKC African setting . Its safety efficiency management vernal keratoconjunctivitis describe several uncontrolled study double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , study relatively small involved population outside Africa predominantly palpebral mixed form VKC . Controversy still remain efficiency cyclosporine severe form allergic conjunctivitis like VKC . We therefore undertake large prospective randomize double-masked , standard treatment control clinical trial Central Africa compare short-term efficiency cyclosporine A ( CsA ) 2 % eye drop , solve olive oil vehicle , steroid drop predominantly limbal form VKC . During 4 week participant randomise either cyclosporine dexamethasone attack treatment VKC . The 4 week thereafter participant receive chromoglycate drop maintenance treatment . Additional objective document difference rebound phenomenon chromoglycate maintenance phase 2 treatment group evaluate safety tolerance test medication .</brief_summary>
