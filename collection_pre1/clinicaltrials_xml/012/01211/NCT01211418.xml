	<detailed_description>Randomization Procedure : Subjects meet DSM-IV cocaine dependence abuse inclusion criterion randomly assign IM NT group , use adaptive urn randomization procedure , adjust gender , referral source ( self-referred count-mandated ) , psychiatric medication ( yes/no ) , type cocaine addiction ( polydrug vs. cocaine ) . Simple randomization may adequate assure balance group know predictive indicator . While primary basis assignment remain randomization , urn randomization bias assignment towards balance group base variable know related treatment outcome sample sizes intermediate . Randomization reduce possibility one group assign disproportionate number patient certain subgroup . Overview Treatment Procedure Twelve treatment session 12 week occur outpatient facility week , 30 minute session . Treatment outcomes assess week 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 ( 3 month treatment ) . The follow-up assessment occur either outpatient facility , office University Maryland ( Kernan Hospital ) . We make follow-up session sit equivalent , provide financial compensation individual travel campus . For want come University , ensure follow-up session treatment facility hold private room separate location staff patient ensure privacy . Subjects clearly assured one treatment facility access treatment outcome data . We consider therapist deliver treatment limit therapist-specific effect independent actual treatment condition . Upon consideration , decide approach could potentially lead overlap delivery two treatment and/or unintentional bias implementation control treatment . Therefore , decide total four therapist similar experience . Two deliver IM therapy , two provide NT . The therapist group similar qualification . To prevent bias , therapists NT blind study hypothesis . Treatment fidelity monitor sample audio record select session ensure separation treatment protocol . If diffusion occur , train utilized . To prevent bias , none therapist involve outcome assessment , blind participant response . Assessment measure conduct research staff available study . Description IM Treatment Procedure Basically , IM RFB combine transition behavior therapy design different stage addiction treatment . Following three stage correspond treatment content include 12-week treatment . 1 . Stage 1 : Treatment Engagement Detoxification ( week 1-2 ) . In pilot study addict difficult sit still 15-mins meditation eye close , could breathe exercise eye open . In study use 6 breaths/minute near resonant-frequency begin IM training . Each subject receive MP3 player customize RFB guide program include wave sound ( audio ) move bar ( visual ) assist subject RF breathing . The subject require abdominal RFB least 15 min per day open-eye first week , close-eye second week , gradually switch combination RFB IM . 2 . Stage 2 : Recovery transition reduce crave irritability ( week 3-6 ) . Based prior feedback RFB , week 3 therapist introduce IM technique one one client practice . Week 3 : introduce 16-mins IM , start close-eye RFB , relax body section section slow breathing , attention plus breathing warm low abdomen . Week 4 : RFB &amp; IM cop tool , therapist help client find key trigger situation stress relapse , apply RFB IM technique copying strategy . Week 5 : add guide imagery IM ( 21 min ) help detoxify brain body , learn scan body part part increase sensation inside . Week 6 : review catch-up miss prior section . 3 . State 3 : Revitalization Relapse Prevention ( week 7-12 ) . Through experience body scan guide imagery , discuss balance work toward change accept experience arise . Integrate IM technique daily life . Week 7 : customize guide imagery problem , balance acceptance change ; Week 8 : introduce full version IM ( 25 min ) technique reverse abdominal breathing , help recharge body vital energy calmness ; conclude IM integrate breath-mind-body oneness - optimal level mind-body integration .

The success IM addiction depend therapist facilitation quality subject 's daily practice ( home-work ) . The description facilitation meeting assign homework list therapist manual available upon request .

Nondirective Therapy ( NT control group ) NT procedure therapist refrain direct client , instead reflect back client latter say , sometimes , restate client 's remark . NT use control treatment previous therapy development study consider good control psychotherapy research . NT chosen study control non-specific effect show contribute outcome therapeutic alliance therapist competency . Thus , treatment condition contain individual therapy interaction . The protocol individualize NT mirror layout IM therapy -12 weekly meeting , 30 minute . Subjects NT group instruct Diaphragmatic Breathing ( DB ) exercise give assign homework ( write journal ) track progress . DB incorporate NT treatment provide non-specific effect associate attention homework completion . In short , Both IM NT group get amount extra contact therapist ( 30 mins/week ) addition regular treatment , breathe exercise ( RFB DB ) homework ( IM write journal ) . Both treatment condition audio-taped evaluation fidelity differentiation . This design make study outcome reliable transferable future therapy development study .</detailed_description>
