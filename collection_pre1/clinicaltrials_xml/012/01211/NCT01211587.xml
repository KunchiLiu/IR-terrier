The word `` experimental '' mean trial drug approve Health Authorities ( government authority ) still test safety effectiveness . Approximately one hundred ( 100 ) patient participate research trial . The research trial conduct approximately thirty ( 30 ) medical center follow country : Argentina , Canada , Italy , Peru , South Africa , Spain USA . The research trial last June 2012 .</brief_summary>
