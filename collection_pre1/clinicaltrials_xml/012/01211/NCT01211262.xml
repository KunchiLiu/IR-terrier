	<brief_summary>IMCgp100 new biological therapy design treatment melanoma skin cancer . The drug design target melanoma cell stimulate immune cell kill . This trial design establish level drug give patient tolerable . It also design establish best dose schedule drug look signal drug work intend .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Tolerability Bispecific Targeted Biologic IMCgp100 Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IMCgp100 bispecific biologic incorporate engineer T cell receptor ( TCR ) specific peptide antigen derive protein gp100 present context HLA A2 surface melanoma cell . The TCR fuse anti-CD3 antibody single-chain variable fragment ( scFv ) recruit activate non-melanoma specific T cell ( killer T cell ) physical contact cancer T cell . This Phase I study design assess safety profile establish tolerable dose IMCgp100 HLA A2 positive malignant melanoma patient . The study two treatment arm different treatment schedule , weekly daily dosing . Each treatment arm study two part . In first part , dose escalation , safety tolerability drug examine optimal dose drug establish . In second part trial , patient receive extended course treatment view assess effect drug disease .</detailed_description>

Haemoglobin ≥9g/dL ( blood transfusion achieve level permit ) 3 . Calculated creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min use modify CockroftGault equation 4 . Neutrophil count ≥1x10⁹/L 5 . Lymphocyte count ≥0.5x10⁹/L 9 . Female patient childbearing potential must use maximally effective birth control period therapy , must willing use contraception 6 month follow last study drug infusion must negative urine serum pregnancy test upon entry study . Otherwise , female patient must postmenopausal ( menstrual period minimum 12 month ) surgically sterile . 10 . Male patient must surgically sterile willing use double barrier contraception method upon enrolment , course study , 6 month follow last study drug infusion . 11 . Patients history adrenal insufficiency , maintain stable replacement dose corticosteroid ( &lt; 10 mg/d prednisone equivalent ) eligible treatment IMCgp100 , unless past history adrenal crisis . Eligible patient history adrenal insufficiency receive replacement dose corticosteroid must receive prophylactic stress dose corticosteroid prior dose first four dos IMCgp100 treatment , regardless weekly daily dose regimen . 12 . Able give inform consent . Patients meet follow criterion exclude study : 1 . Symptomatic brain metastasis unstable , require steroid , require radiation within last 28 day . 2 . Other active malignancy past 5 year except carcinoma situ , completely excise nonmelanomatous skin cancer malignancy opinion investigator consider cure . 3 . Comorbid medical condition would increase risk toxicity opinion investigator sponsor . Symptomatic ongoing infection must resolve patient treat study . 4 . Uveitis 5 . Had myocardial infarction within 1 year enrolment , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association &gt; Class II ) , unstable angina unstable cardiac arrhythmia require medication . 6 . Has ejection fraction &lt; 50 % . 7 . Clinically significant electrocardiogram ( ECG ) change obscure ability ass RR , PR QT interval .
