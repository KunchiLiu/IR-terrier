	<brief_summary>The main objective trial study efficacy bag larva wound debridement comparison classical treatment . The secondary outcome ass wound healing , treatment related pain , microbiological modification , adverse event , comfort dress duration wound care . We perform randomize , double-blind , multicenter , control , prospective phase III trial three referral institutional center hospitalize care Caen , Lisieux Lyon , France . A total 120 patient non-healing fibrinous wound ≤ 40cm2 , less 2cm-deep , ankle-brachial pressure index ( ABPI ) ≥ 0.8 include , March 2005 December 2008 . During two weeks´ hospitalization , patient receive either Maggot Debridement Therapy ( MDT , change bag larva twice week ) classical treatment ( mechanical debridement classical dressing perform three time week ) . At discharge , classical dressing apply follow-up visit perform D30 . Main outcome measure comparison reduction fibrin percentage wound treat MDT classical treatment D15 . The percentage fibrin measure use computerized planimetry software package , Canvas ( ACD Systems , British Columbia , Canada ) , enable quantification color surface variation wind manual delimitation ( use mouse ) series photographic image .</brief_summary>
