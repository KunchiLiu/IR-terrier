	<brief_summary>Background : - Autoinflammatory disease illnesses produce episode inflammation fever , rash , joint swelling . Some disease treat medication block body 's reaction protein call IL-1 , may part cause inflammation . IL-1 block agent helpful treat autoinflammatory diseases become standard care treatment disease . However , research need related disease may treat new currently use IL-1 block agent . - XOMA 052 experimental drug currently test possible treatment type 2 diabetes . Initial study show XOMA 052 neutralizes specific kind IL-1 , also active certain indicator inflammation . Researchers interested determine whether XOMA 052 use treat autoinflammatory related disease . Objectives : - To determine effectiveness XOMA 052 treatment inflammation adult autoinflammatory disease Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome ( FCAS ) /Muckle-Wells Syndrome ( MWS ) Behcet 's Disease . Eligibility : - FCAS/ MWS : Individuals least 18 year age know history typical disease . - Behcet 's Disease : Individuals least 18 year age evidence active disease , oral genital ulcer eye disease . Design : FCAS/MWS Participants - Participants overnight evaluation disease , include optional test ( e.g. , eye skin exam ) . Participants currently take medication treat symptom stop take medication monitor study researcher . At first flare symptom , participant begin receive XOMA 052 . - Participants test day 3 , 7 , 10 initial dose XOMA 052 . If disease remain good control , participant clinical exam every 5 day 10 week another disease flare occur ( determine either symptoms inflammation observe laboratory study ) . If disease well control initial dose XOMA 052 , participant additional dos start day 7 either disease controlled researcher determine medication effective . - Participants option continue XOMA 052 treatment 1 year . XOMA 052 wil ...</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study XOMA 052 Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome / Muckle-Wells Syndrome Behcet 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autoinflammatory disease illnesses characterized episode inflammation , unlike autoimmune disorder , lack production high titer autoantibody antigen-specific T cell . There grow genetic clinical evidence Interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) play pathogenic role several disease . This exploratory study aim examine utility experimental drug candidate , XOMA 052 ( XOMA ( US ) , LLC ) treatment adult subject autoinflammatory disorder familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome ( FCAS ) Muckle-Wells Syndrome ( MWS ) associate mutation cryopyrin-encoding CIAS1 adult subject Behcet 's Disease ( BD ) , disease may responsive IL-1 blockade . XOMA 052 human recombinant IL-1beta antibody picomolar affinity IL-1beta beta half-life 22.4 day human . This agent currently Phase 2 clinical study treatment Type 2 Diabetes initial study show activity clinical biochemical indicator inflammation . This pilot study design address : 1 ) utility XOMA 052 treatment FCAS / MWS , disease know respond IL-1 blockade ( FCAS / MWS ) show response treatment anakinra ( Kineret ( Registered Trademark ) , recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist ) , rilonacept ( Arcalyst ( Registered Trademark ) , IL-1 Trap , fusion protein IL-1 receptor Fc portion IgG ) , canakinumab ( Ilaris ( Registered Trademark ) , IL-1beta block antibody ) ; latter two FDA approve treatment condition ; 2 ) pharmacokinetics dynamic treatment XOMA 052 FCAS / MWS ; 3 ) effect XOMA 052 laboratory biomarkers BD ; 4 ) exploratory assessment utility XOMA 052 treatment BD . For FCAS / MWS , biochemical clinical correlate autoinflammatory disease measure baseline follow withdrawal currently use IL-1 inhibitor . Subjects receive course therapy XOMA 052 predict provide estimate 4 week anti-inflammatory activity . If favorable response obtain , continuation phase last twelve month . For BD , subject receive XOMA 052 three six month patient positive response randomize withdrawal continuation drug six month . Clinical biochemical correlate inflammation measure patient group appropriate interval assess response elucidate disease mechanism .</detailed_description>
