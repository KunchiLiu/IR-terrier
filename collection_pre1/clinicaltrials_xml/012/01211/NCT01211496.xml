	<brief_summary>We explore unique weight-training program men woman 65 year old emphasizes high speed training . We believe speed muscle move may important performance functional task strong muscle . We compare velocity train traditional strength training determine method great effect muscle strength , speed movement , functional performance physical disability . We believe high speed train improve measure great extent simply train increase muscle strength . Aging also result loss bone mass , increase risk fall fracture . Strength training also show maintain bone mass elderly , study examine high velocity resistance training maintenance bone mass . We believe important examine aspect velocity training recommendation make .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study compare 12 week explosive high-speed power train traditional slow-speed strength training . Outcome measure include muscle performance : leg press ( LP ) knee extension ( KE ) one-repetition maximum ( 1RM ) LP peak power ( PP ) , velocity peak power ( PPV ) force peak power ( PPF ) 40 % -90 % 1RM . Measures function consist habitual maximal gait velocity , short physical performance battery ( SPPB ) , forward tandem walk , low limb movement time ( brake speed ) automobile drive simulator . Participants report laboratory 2 week baseline measurement . On visit 1 , subject explain study complete informed consent document . On visit 2 3 , muscle performance functional measure obtain . The following week , muscle performance functional measure repeat establish reliability . At end baseline testing , participant randomize treatment . Following 12-week RT intervention , post-training muscle performance functional measure obtain . Resistance Training Protocol . Volunteers randomize high-speed power training ( HSPT ) slow-speed strength training ( SSST ) exercise 3 time per week 12 week use computer-interfaced Keiser a420 pneumatic leg press knee extension RT equipment ( Fresno , CA ) . For HSPT , train session consist 3 set 12-14 repetition 40 % 1RM . Participants perform explosive movement high speed concentric phase repetition , pause one-second , perform eccentric portion contraction 2 second . Volunteers randomize SSST also exercise 3 time per week 12 week train session consist 3 set 8-10 repetition 80 % 1RM . The participant perform movement slow velocity ( 2 concentric phase repetition ) , pause one second , perform eccentric portion contraction 2 second . CON meet three time week warm-up stretching exercise , perform RT . HSPT SSST participate warm-up stretching exercise CON . Measures Maximal strength power . Leg press seat knee extension 1RM obtain use Keiser pneumatic RT equipment fit a420 electronics . The seat recumbent LP KE apparatus position place hip knee joint 90 100 degree flexion . The 1RM obtain progressively increase resistance subject longer able push one repetition successfully . The Borg Scale use assist evaluate 1RM ( combine perceive maximal effort ) reach . Peak muscle power obtain 40 % , 50 % , 60 % , 70 % , 80 % 90 % 1RM approximately 30 minute 1RM test ( 8,9 ) . Participants instruct exert `` fast possible '' relative percentage 1RM . Three attempt make resistance great PP output obtain resistance use analysis . The corresponding PPV PPF obtain external resistance 40 % -90 % 1RM . The 1RM measure bi-weekly HSPT SSST relative training intensity adjust accordingly ensure adequate overload training . Post-training muscle performance measure obtain use load relative initial baseline 1RM well post-training 1RM .</detailed_description>
