	<brief_summary>When patient come Emergency Department injury infection often need painful procedure perform essential allow recover . To accomplish , doctor often use `` procedural sedation '' . This involve give medication intravenous line order relieve patient 's pain make drowsy painful procedure perform . This allow medical staff perform necessary procedure patient without cause pain anguish . There several type medication combination medication use procedural sedation . Each medication advantage disadvantage . Consequently , research necessary determine medication combination medication effective safest . This study compare use one drug ( Propofol ) versus use combination Propofol another drug ( Ketamine ) . Both drug already use procedural sedation emergency department know best safest . The investigator believe combination ketamine propofol together work good good propofol alone safe option well . Propofol well known sedative use many emergency department clinical experience good act quickly wear quickly . However , propofol good pain-killer also cause patient stop breathing . This monitoring patient 's breathing vital sign essential procedural sedation . It known ketamine good pain-killer help patient maintain breathe . Doctors sometimes use ketamine alone procedural sedation patient take long time wake ketamine use . Thus , investigator think combine ketamine propofol investigator perform painful procedure use procedural sedation without cause patient stop breathe often propofol alone . Also , ketamine investigator use help treat pain make comfortable . The investigator plan enroll 284 patient course one year . The primary outcome adverse respiratory event , well secondary outcome assess course sedation recovery period , approximately one hour . Quality life score pain assess telephone interview 3 day procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ketofol v Propofol Emergency Department Procedural Sedation Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procedural sedation analgesia ( PSA ) painful procedure standard care emergency medicine . The ideal PSA agent safe , easy administer , provide analgesia amnesia rapid onset , quick recovery minimum adverse effect . A variety medication study procedural sedation single medication currently use meet criterion . Two medication well know often used procedural sedation propofol ketamine . Both medication show highly effective important limitation emergency practice . Propofol know cause respiratory depression , apnea , hypotension dose-dependent fashion . Ketamine display long recovery time propofol patient receive ketamine sedation prone vomit unpleasant emergence reaction . The use ketamine propofol combination theoretically compelling sedative effect propofol logically balance nauseant psychomimetic effect ketamine ability achieve deep sedation lower dos ketamine logically permit short physiologic recovery time compare ketamine alone . As well , ketamine provide analgesic effect absent propofol show safer use opioid analgesia fentanyl consider airway event . This study seek evaluate ketamine-propofol combination potentially provide effective procedural sedation analgesia expose patient less risk associated respiratory depression differential effect ketamine propofol may lead few adverse event either medication use alone . Propofol nonopioid , nonbarbiturate , sedative-hypnotic agent whose desirable property include rapid onset , short duration action , reliability produce sedation . It also act anti-emetic analgesic property . Adverse effect include dose-related cardiovascular respiratory depression bradycardia . This dose-dependent respiratory depression , apnea hypotension may present barrier widespread clinical utility propofol . In addition , lack analgesic effect may necessitate use agent provide pain relief procedural sedation . The use opioid analgesia conjunction propofol sedation well know increase risk adverse airway event . Ketamine agent classify dissociative sedative know provide efficacious safe procedural sedation preservation airway reflexes respiratory drive . The use ketamine severe acute pain emergency department show decrease opioid requirement trauma patient well reduce pain propofol injection . During deep sedation propofol , use sub-dissociative ketamine analgesia emergency department procedural sedation result few adverse airway event fentanyl . The main limitation use ketamine alone procedural sedation longer recovery time incidence dysphoric emergence reaction , especially adult . Ketamine-propofol combination use successfully safely variety purpose , include gynecological ophthalmological procedure , sedation spinal anesthesia , cardiovascular procedure adult child . Ketamine propofol mixed syringe show safe effective operating room office setting . Combining ketamine propofol appear provide anesthetic synergy widen therapeutic index , permit induction anesthesia sedation dose less likely lead respiratory depression . Thus , combination ketamine propofol receive interest emergency department procedural sedation regimen allow provision PSA use drug dos lower typically required agent alone potentially result few adverse effect shorter recovery time . Propofol potent sedative anti-nauseant property think likely mitigate problematic adverse psychomimetic nauseant effect ketamine . Ketamine propofol know physically chemically stable mixed polypropylene syrinx mixture display stable respiratory hemodynamic parameter healthy patient general anesthesia . The use ketamine propofol combination ED limit . A pilot study 20 child show ketamine propofol administer separate syrinx ED patient result reliable deep sedation adverse effect . Prospective ED case series child adult show ketamine propofol mixed single syringe 1:1 ratio ( call `` ketofol '' ) appear effective ED PSA agent well tolerated appear safe . To date , randomize trial compare single-syringe ketofol know ED PSA agent , thus theoretical advantage ketamine-propofol combination ( ketofol ) yet definitively know . Methodology Experimental Design : This study prospective , double-blind , randomized clinical trial . A systematic review literature propofol use emergency department procedural sedation use explicit criterion carry . Trials select base follow criterion : 1 ) propofol alone sedation agent use , 2 ) At least 30 minute `` washout '' period pre-procedural analgesic use commencement procedural sedation , 3 ) Propofol use intermittent bolus technique , 4 ) Patients great 14 year age , 5 ) Study publish less 10 year previously , 6 ) Study perform emergency department . Nine study identify total 1679 patient . These review respect report airway event base Quebec Criteria definition airway event . The composite adverse airway event study 21 % ( 95 % CI 19.05 % 22.95 % ) . The composite Quebec Criteria adverse event rate study ketamine-propofol sedation determine available literature . Three study identify total enrollment 166 patient . Airway event data prospective case series ( n=328 ) perform LGH also include . The pooled result yield composite adverse airway event rate 8 % ( 95 % CI 5.87 % 10.73 % ) . Based data ( 21 % event rate propofol arm , 8 % anticipated event rate ketamine-propofol arm ) , 129 subject would need group ( total 258 subject ) 80 % power detect difference magnitude great ( alpha 0.05 , two-sided calculation ) . An additional 10 % enrollment add total enrollment offset potential drop-outs , result total sample size 284 subject ( 142 arm ) . Written , informed consent obtain patient parent/guardian age 18 year . Enrollment Projection : The emergency department Lions Gate Hospital presently perform average 55 procedural sedation per month . Assuming 50 % enrollment rate ( base local enrollment experience ED randomize trial ) , would expect full study enrollment would occur within 12 month . All patient receive pre-procedural analgesia discretion treat physician . For entry study minimum 30-minute `` washout '' period analgesic use commencement procedural sedation . Sealed envelope contain randomized assignment either propofol-alone ketamine-propofol prepared use web-based random number generator . Block randomization do ( random block size ) ensure approximate allocation two arm study throughout enrollment , thus maximize statistical power unanticipated event lead trial termination prior complete enrollment . Data , include crossover contamination ( exceedingly unlikely ) analyse Intent Treat principle . Identical pre-prepared syrinx contain either propofol-alone ketamine-propofol mixture , prepare trained in-serviced registered nurse . Medications overseen emergency department clinical pharmacist . To assist blinding , patient wear reflective sunglass order obscure eye movement ( nystagmus - know effect ketamine ) study investigator . All sedation perform continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring direct Vancouver Coastal Health Authority Guidelines Emergency Department Procedural Sedation Analgesia . All procedural sedation event require attendance certify emergency physician , register nurse , respiratory therapist . Vital sign include heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation , end-tidal carbon dioxide monitor continuously record every 2 minute . Blood pressure record every 4 minute . A separate , standardized data sheet use collect time study drug administration , time procedure start , time procedure completion , time physiologic recovery . Recovery assess completion procedure use modify Aldrete Scale every 2 minute full recovery , define minimum cumulative score 8 . The attend physician ask document complication occur procedure intervention necessary . The nurse caring patient also ask record adverse event occur recovery phase . To evaluate success study blinding , conclusion sedation attend physician nurse ask independently guess whether patient question receive propofol-only ketamine-propofol . Primary secondary outcome assess course sedation procedure recovery , le one hour vast majority case . Quality Life pain score assess telephone interview 72 hour sedation procedure . Analysis : Statistical consultation prior study launch obtain VCHRI Centre Clinical Epidemiology Evaluation ( C2E2 ) . Analysis primary outcome : The number proportion patient suffer respiratory AE report treatment group . A 95 % CI difference treatment group determine . The equality two proportion test use Fisher 's exact test . Analysis secondary outcome : Quality sedation . The number proportion patient RSS &lt; 5 procedure , require sedation time procedure report treatment group . The equality two proportion test use Fisher 's exact test . For secondary outcome descriptive analysis plan . Analysis safety outcome : Frequencies percentages complication adverse event ( exclude respiratory ) treatment group report 95 % CI 's . Interim Analyses : There plan interim analyse either efficacy safety . The Mann-Whitney test use compare difference satisfaction level ( measure ordinal scale ) group . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
