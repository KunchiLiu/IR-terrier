	<brief_title>The FLU-FOBT Program Primary Care Settings Where Disparities Persist</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIM 1 ( Year 1 ) : To adapt pilot test FLU-FOBT Program nurse-run intervention primary care visit San Francisco 's Chinatown Public Health Center . The FLU-FOBT Program design way trigger offer fecal occult blood testing ( FOBT ) eligible patient whenever influenza vaccination ( FLU ) provide . Specific component FLU-FOBT Program develop process active collaboration health center staff . The FLU-FOBT Program implement fall 2008-9 evaluated combination process measure Year 1 study . This formative work use finalize FLU-FOBT Program study efficacy robustness affiliate San Francisco public health center . AIM 2 ( Year 2 3 ) : To test efficacy FLU-FOBT Program improve colorectal cancer screen rate time-randomized , controlled trial involve public health center San Francisco Community Health Network serve ethnically diverse , economically disadvantaged patient . During 2009-10 influenza vaccination season , FLU-FOBT Program test randomized trial within 6 public health center San Francisco . On half randomly select date clinic , nurse follow protocol directs offer FOBT eligible patient whenever offer influenza vaccine ( intervention ) , date nurse direct offer influenza vaccine alone ( control ) . The primary efficacy outcome proportion intervention subject age 50 80 initially due CRCS become date 3 month intervention complete , compare similar subject control group . AIM 3 ( Years 2 3 ) : To evaluate robustness FLU-FOBT Program implement within 6 clinic . In 2009-10 influenza vaccination season , also test robustness FLU-FOBT Program implement 6 site participate time-randomized trial . Robustness measure accord RE-AIM framework ( Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation , Maintenance ) describe Glasgow others [ 2 ] . Reach measure proportion target population offer screening , Effectiveness measure proportion target population get screen intervention . Adoption measure proportion invite influenza vaccination clinic sit clinic staff member participate ; Implementation assess accord fidelity participate site clinic staff follow key element FLU-FOBT Program protocol adapt protocol accommodate local need constraint . Maintenance assess determine number intervention site continue FLU-FOBT Program year intervention complete , overall success program continue . AIM 4 ( Year 3 ) : To develop FLU-FOBT Program Toolkit adopt locally disseminate public health clinic rely annual FOBT primary strategy average risk colorectal cancer screening . Study result participate health center use develop evidence-based FLU-FOBT Toolkit distribute serve practical guide clinical decision maker wish adapt replicate intervention within clinic serve diverse community experience disparity colorectal cancer screening . The Toolkit include key element must preserve order FLU-FOBT Program successful , well examples enhancement successfully implement different clinic</detailed_description>
