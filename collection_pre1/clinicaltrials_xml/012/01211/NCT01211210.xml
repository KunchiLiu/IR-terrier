	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Preoperative 5-Fu base chemoradiation become standard treatment stage 2/3 rectal cancer . However whether patient , especially T3N0-1M0 patient , really need radiation local control total mesentery excision apply routine practice still unknown . And whether new drug add achieve good local distant control worth investigate . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study 5Fu base radiation therapy FOLFOX base radiation FOLFOX alone , compare see well work give surgery treat patient intermediate risk resectable rectal cancer . It yet know whether 5-Fu base FOLFOX base radiation therapy even FOLFOX alone effective treat rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant FOLFOX6 Chemotherapy With Without Radiation Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary Compare objective response rate rate local-regional relapse patient resectable rectal cancer treat either 5-Fu FOLFOX base chemoradiotherapy FOLFOX alone without radiation . Secondary 1 . Compare rate pathologic complete response patient treat regimen . 2 . Compare local recurrence rate 2.Determine increase number patient able undergo sphincter-saving surgery treatment regimen . 3.Correlate genetic pattern presence absence specific tissue biomarkers response prognosis patient treat regimen . 4.Compare preoperative quality life ( QOL ) patient treated oral capecitabine versus continuous infusion fluorouracil . pelvic auto-nerve function 5.Determine impact oxaliplatin neurotoxicity patient treat regimen . 6.Compare toxic effect regimens patient . 7.Compare convenience care patient treat regimen . 8.Determine impact type surgical management QOL 1 year postoperatively patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multi-center study . Patients stratify accord participate center , gender , clinical tumor stage ( stage II vs. stage III ) , surgical intent ( sphincter save vs. non-sphincter saving ) . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . - Arm A : Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously undergo radiotherapy daily 5 day week 5-6 week . - Arm B : Patients receive FOLFOX 4 cycle undergo radiotherapy arm I second cycle FOLFOX . - Arm C : Patients receive FOLFOX 4 cycle Within 4-6 week completion chemo radiotherapy , patient respond stable disease undergo surgery . Patients progressive disease treat discretion investigator continue follow . Patients progressive disease arm III receive radiation . Quality life assess baseline , completion chemo radiotherapy , 1 year surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3years . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 495 patient accrue study within 5 year . Eligibility Ages Eligible Study : 18-75 Years old Genders Eligible Study : Both Accepts Healthy Volunteers : No</detailed_description>
