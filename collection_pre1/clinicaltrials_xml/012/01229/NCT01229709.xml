	<detailed_description>Tinnitus medical term acoustical perception hear ear ( ) head , produce external sound . This sound experience ringing , buzzing , whoosh , hiss . Estimates suggest many 50 million people United States experience tinnitus degree . Approximately 12 million people experience tinnitus bothersome enough seek medical treatment . Two 3 million Americans severely affected tinnitus extent ability function severely impaired . Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) establish treatment broad applicability clinical science . MBSR scientifically show improve well-being health treatment depression ( Mason O , Hargreaves I . 2001 ) , anxiety ( Kabat-Zinn , et al 1992 ) , stress ( Kabat-Zinn , et al . 1992 ) , fibromyalgia ( Grossman , et al . 2007 ) , chronic fatigue ( Surawy , et al . 2005 ) , psoriasis ( Kabat-Zinn , et al . 2003 ) , treatment cancer ( Speca , et al . 2006 ) , multiple schlerosis ( Grossman , et al . 2010 ) , pain ( Kabat-Zinn , et al . 1985 ) . Treatments use pain management particular interest study tinnitus many similarity individual suffer tinnitus pain drawn . Both pain tinnitus patient commonly express perceived lack control symptom , problem aspect attention focus , maladaptive coping strategy , catastrophic thinking , use similar treatment method ( e.g. , cognitive coping strategy , CBT , relaxation technique ) ( Moller , 2000 , Tonndorf , 1987 ) . Like intractable pain , single identifiable cause tinnitus , single medical surgical treatment effective , wide range psychological effect , one 's lifestyle general health particularly affect . One first study look mindfulness mean pain management conduct Jon Kabat-Zinn , Lipworth , Burney ( 1985 ) . They take 90 patient chronic pain train ten-week stress reduction relaxation program . Significant reduction present moment pain , negative body image , inhibition activity pain , mood disturbance anxiety depression show . Significant improvement activity level feeling self-esteem also report . Reductions improvement maintain 15-months post-treatment . Due success mindfulness-based intervention chronic pain , heal benefit mindfulness translate tinnitus care study . To date one pilot study conduct use mindfulness meditation treatment tinnitus . A study conduct Wales Sadlier , Stephens , &amp; Kennedy ( 2008 ) use combination cognitive behavioral therapy mindfulness meditation treat 25 individual chronic tinnitus . The subject split two group . The treatment group receive four one-hour session CBT Mindfulness Meditation practice second group wait 3-months treated intervention . Significant reduction tinnitus post-treatment 4 6 month follow-up record . The propose MBTR study isolate mindfulness CBT approach tinnitus , may important contribution clinical literature care tinnitus . Introduction Specific Aims This study aim determine efficacy MBTR reduce symptom tinnitus adult . Primary objective include : 1 ) Design execute MBTR program within UCSF Department Audiology patient tinnitus . 2 ) Determine patient 's benefit participate 8-week MBTR program measure reduction clinical symptom , present , tinnitus symptom perception shift . 3 ) Compare responses study measure control group . 4 ) Use data patient feedback modify UCSF 's Audiology program guide future program regard treatment care patient tinnitus . The mentioned objective meet test follow primary hypothesis : Hypothesis 1a : MBTR + TAU effective TAU alone reduce tinnitus symptom ( 25-item Tinnitus Handicap Inventory [ THI ] ) adult patient chronic tinnitus 8-week period . Hypothesis 1b : MBTR + TAU effective TAU alone reduce tinnitus symptom ( 25-item Tinnitus Handicap Inventory [ THI ] ) adult patient chronic tinnitus 3-months follow-up . Hypothesis 1c : Reduction tinnitus symptom ( 25-item Tinnitus Handicap Inventory [ THI ] ) MBTR + TAU maintain 12-months follow-up . Secondary hypothesis analyse follow : Hypothesis 2 : Effect Functional Status : MBTR + TAU effective TAU alone reduce anxiety depressive symptom , exist ( 17-item Hamilton Anxiety Depression Scale [ HADS ] ) reduce additional clinical symptom , exist ( 90-item Symptom Checklist-90-Revised [ SCL-90-R ] ) enhance mindfulness ( 39-item Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire [ FFMQ ] ) . Hypothesis 3 : Mediators MBTR Efficacy : The effect MBTR tinnitus severity ( THI , Tinnitus Visual Analogue Scale [ TVAS ] ) functional status ( HADS SCL-90-R ) mediate enhanced mindfulness ( FFMQ ) . Hypothesis 4 : Length Efficacy : We assess whether treatment gain tinnitus severity ( THI , TVAS ) , functional status ( HADS , SCL-90-R ) , mindfulness ( FFMQ ) retain 3-months 12-months follow-up experimental group . Research Design Methods Subject Recruitment A chart review past patient ( approximately 700 ) UCSF Audiology Clinic see Tinnitus Counseling ( Treatment Usual-TAU ) least six-months prior enrollment study take place . A list inclusion/exclusion criterion . Inclusion Criteria Subject Characteristics - Age &gt; 18 - English speaking - Duration subjective chronic tinnitus &gt; 6 month - Received Tinnitus Counseling ( TAU ) UCSF Audiology Clinic &gt; 6 month prior enter study - Moderate strong tinnitus annoyance ( Minimum THI score &gt; 24 per chart review ) Exclusion Criteria Subject Characteristics - Age &lt; 18 - Non-English speaking - &gt; Moderate Hearing Loss - Duration chronic subjective tinnitus &lt; 6 month - Severe depression and/or anxiety ( measure HADS ) - Recent ( within 3-month ) history alcohol drug abuse dependence tobacco caffeine - No recent ( within 3 month ) start new tinnitus treatment - History psychotic disorder dementia - THI score &lt; 24 - Currently undergo litigation legal matter related auditory disorder Three hundred letter mail patient Clinic 's database meet inclusion criterion see tinnitus counsel least six-months prior entry study . Patients respond via postcard whether would like learn study . Patients informed letter response receive via postcard Clinic within two week , research assistant follow phone call reminder respond . To prevent over-enrollment/recruitment subject , letter send wave 100 time . Recruitment stop 80 patient respond participate ( 20 % drop out-rate expect bring number 64 ) . The 80 patient express interest participate study meet inclusion criterion per chart review invite take part 30-minute individual interview one two MBTR course instructor prior begin program . The 30-minute individual interview serve orientation MBTR program time consent sign . Subjects randomly assign 2 group 32 participant , completion 30-minute interview research assistant administer baseline psychometric assessment ( see list measure use ) . Primary Outcome Measures â€¢ Tinnitus Handicap Inventory ( THI ) The THI self-report measure use busy clinical practice quantify impact tinnitus daily living . The measure brief , easy administer interpret , broad scope , psychometrically robust . Convergent validity assess use another measure perceive tinnitus handicap ( Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire ) . Construct validity assess use Beck Depression Inventory , Modified Somatic Perception Questionnaire , symptom rating scale ( annoyance , sleep disruption , depression , concentration ) , perceive tinnitus pitch loudness judgment . The THI comprise 25-item item group functional , emotional , catastrophic subscales . The total scale yield excellent internal consistency reliability ( Cronbach 's alpha=.93 ) . Secondary Outcome Measures - Tinnitus Visual Analogue Scale ( TVAS ) Tinnitus Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) collection straight line 100mm length anchor end extreme ( e.g. , bothersome , extremely bothersome ) tinnitus sensation , feel response . The strength method lie compellation several measurement ( e.g. , weekly average tinnitus annoyance ) . This method measure distress recommend use research ( Axelsson , Coles , Erlandsson , Meikle , &amp; Vernon , 1993 ) . - Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) The HADS ( Zigmond &amp; Snaith , 1983 ) choose measure self-reported depression anxiety .
