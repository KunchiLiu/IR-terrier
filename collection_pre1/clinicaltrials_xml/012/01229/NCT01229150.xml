	<brief_summary>Background : AZD6244 ( ARRY-142886 ) investigational anticancer drug design block critical component ( MEK ( methyl ethyl ketone ) ) pathway ( MAP ( mitogen-activated protein ) kinase pathway ) cause lung cancer cell grow . The MAP kinase pathway could overactive proportion lung cancer , include also another mutation protein know KRAS ( Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ) . Approximately 20 % lung cancer KRAS mutation make cancer treatment include erlotinib , standard anticancer treatment drug less effective . Researchers interested determine whether AZD6244 effective treating advance NSCLC ( non small cell lung cancer ) , include KRAS mutate lung cancer respond standard therapy . Objectives : To determine effectiveness AZD6244 , either alone combination erlotinib , prevent tumor growth individual NSCLC . Eligibility : Individuals least 18 year age diagnose advanced NSCLC respond standard therapy . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical examination , blood test , image study , potentially , tumor biopsy test determine whether participant 's NSCLC contain mutation KRAS protein . - Participants divide two group base status KRAS protein NSCLC tumor cell : - Individuals normal KRAS protein : Half receive AZD6244 erlotinib , half receive erlotinib . - Individuals mutate KRAS protein : Half receive AZD6244 erlotinib , half receive AZD6244 . - Participants take assigned medication daily ( empty stomach morning and/or evening , depend treatment ) 28-day cycle treatment . Participants also keep medication diary record side effect . - Participants frequent blood test first cycle treatment , image study test require study researcher . Participants may also additional tumor biopsy end first treatment cycle . - Treatment continue disease progress , significant side effect develop , participant chooses leave study , researcher end study ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Lung Cancer lead cause death among men woman . Of approximately 172,000 patient diagnose every year non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) US , 55 % present advanced stage disease . The current treatment advance NSCLC first line chemotherapy platinum-based doublet . Second line treatment recurrent progressive disease include treatment chemotherapy treatment oral EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Several mechanism resistance EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor discover . Presence KRAS mutation one . AZD6244 ( ARRY-142886 ) investigational drug orally available target critical kinase ( MEK ) mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase signal transduction pathway activate NSCLC downstream EGFR . Objectives : - Determine progression free survival ( PFS ) use combination AZD6244 erlotinib patient wild type KRAS advance NSCLC - Determine clinical response rate ( PR ( partial response ) + CR ( complete response ) ) either monotherapy AZD6244 combination AZD6244 plus erlotinib patient mutate KRAS advance NSCLC - Evaluate disease control rate ( PR+CR+SD ( stable disease ) ) overall survival patient group . - Determine safety profile use AZD6244 combination erlotinib patient advance NSCLC . - Measure serological marker evaluate marker correlate tumor response . - Measure change tumor MIB-1 ( Ki-67 ) rate pERK level response treatment AZD6244 . Eligibility : - Patients pathologically confirm NSCLC amenable potentially curative therapy progress treat least one prior platinum contain chemotherapy regimen , refuse cytotoxic chemotherapy . - Progressive disease document prior enrollment study . - Patient 2 prior chemotherapy regimen . - Measurable disease RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) criterion . - Adequate renal , cardiac , hepatic hematopoietic function - No major surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy within 28 day enrollment . Design : - Patients stratified basis KRAS mutational status . Wild-Type KRAS patient randomize receive either single agent erlotinib 150 mg/day combination erlotinib 100 mg/day plus AZD6244 150 mg/day . KRAS mutant patient randomize receive AZD6244 monotherapy dose 75 mg twice per day , combination AZD6244 150 mg/day plus erlotinib 100 mg/day . - Treatment continue disease progression . - Toxicity assess every cycle CTCAE ( Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ) Version 4.0 . - Tumor assessment RECIST 1.1 criterion perform every 2 cycle ( one cycle 28 day ) . - Correlative study include initial tumor mutational analysis tissue immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) study do exist tumor block , re-biopsied tissue prior enrollment . - Patients evaluate potential undergo repeat tumor biopsy 1 cycle therapy . Tumors assess MIB-1 ( Ki-67 ) pERK level IHC . - The study accrue 40 patient wild-type KRAS NSCLC 60 patient mutate KRAS NSCLC .</detailed_description>

Patients must measurable disease RECIST criterion , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) great equal 20 mm conventional technique great equal 10 mm spiral CT ( compute tomography ) scan . Patients must least one prior platinumcontaining chemotherapy regimen , refuse cytotoxic chemotherapy . Patients two prior chemotherapy regimen . Chemotherapy regimens limit maximum minimum number cycle . Patients enrol trial complete last chemotherapy regimen least 4 week ago . Patients complete radiation therapy least 4 week prior enrollment . Adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy count prior chemotherapy advance disease year enrollment . Age great equal 18 year , dose adverse event data currently available use AZD6244 ( ARRY142886 ) monotherapy combination erlotinib patient less 18 year age . Children exclude study eligible future pediatric phase 2 combination trial . Life expectancy great 3 month .
