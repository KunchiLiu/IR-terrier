	<brief_summary>The primary aim study test etoricoxib decrease perioperative blood loss compare diclofenac . Secondary question explore : - Does etoricoxib prevent Heterotopic ossification Total Hip Arthroplasty well diclofenac ? - Do diclofenac etoricoxib reduce pain rest movement ? - Does etoricoxib compare diclofenac reduce amount rescue medication ( Oxycodon ) ? - Does etoricoxib improve gastrointestinal tolerability compare diclofenac ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Etoricoxib Compared Diclofenac Perioperative Treatment Patients After Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total Hip Arthroplasty ( THA ) common surgical procedure orthopaedic surgery associate perioperative blood loss severe postoperative pain . Adequate pain management important achieve early mobilisation order avoid immobility-induced complication . Non steroidal antirheumatic agent ( NSAIDs ) selective Cox-2 inhibitor commonly use management postoperative pain . There exist non-selective selective Cox-inihibitors . Non-selective NSAIDs block systhesis prostagandins two iso-enzymes cyclooxygenase , Cox-1 Cox-2 . For reason bleeding risk operation ( e.g.tonsillectomy ) increase . In regard , perioperative use Cox-2 selective NSAIDs advantageous pain management tonsillectomy . This could show Rifecoxib , selective Cox-2 inihibitor . For THAs treatment Etoricoxib , also selective Cox-2 inhibitor , possible complication increase risk haematoma , gastrointestinal bleed need blood transfusion could possibly reduce . Selective Cox-2 inhibitor interfere coagulation system . Study result show selective Cox-2 inhibitor like meloxicam reduce perioperative blood loss . Thus , besides ensure good perioperative pain management , selective Cox-2 inhibitor may addition cause less blood loss non-selective NSAIDs.This possible reduction blood loss pain management Etoricoxib ( Arcoxia ) investigate described clinical trial . Heterotopic ossification ( HO ) complication occur THA lead postoperative pain reduce function . Non-selective NSAIDs commonly use prophylaxis heterotopic ossification THA . The exact mechanism prevention bone formation unclear . Some result indicate development HO follow Cox-2 pathway . A aim clinical trial investigate efficacy Etoricoxib prevention heterotropic ossification .</detailed_description>
