Obtain record infant weight medication dose weight calculation appropriate study drug dose different actual weight 5 . Record follow lab obtain within 72 hour prior start study drug . Use laboratory value closest enrollment multiple test . a. Hematology : hematocrit , hemoglobin , white blood cell count differential , platelet count b. Serum chemistry : glucose , creatinine , blood urea nitrogen , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase , total direct bilirubin , sodium , potassium , chloride , calcium , magnesium , total protein , albumin f. Record result sterile body fluid culture ( blood , urine , CSF , peritoneal fluid ) obtain standard clinical care 72 hour prior study drug administration . Record urine culture obtain sterile catheterization suprapubic aspiration g. Document antimicrobial vasopressor 72 hour prior study drug administration 4.3.2 Procedures During Study Drug Administration ( Day 1 Day 2/3 ) 1 . Record study drug time infusion - include start/stop time infusion amount give 2 . Record AEs ( definitely probably related study drug ) time first dose study drug 3 . Record SAEs time first dose study drug 4 . Record concomitant antimicrobial vasopressor administer 5 . Collect blood PK analysis ( see Appendix 2 ) 6 . Record follow lab obtain 72 hour follow 1st dose study drug . Use laboratory value closest end 72 hour period multiple test a. Hematology : hematocrit , hemoglobin , white blood cell count differential , platelet count b. Serum chemistry : glucose , creatinine , blood urea nitrogen , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase , total direct bilirubin , sodium , potassium , chloride , calcium , magnesium , total protein , albumin . ( * A serum creatinine must record within ( ) 72 hour 1st dose study drug ) g. Record result culture sterile body fluid ( blood , urine , CSF , peritoneal fluid , sterile body fluid ) obtain per standard care . Record urine culture obtain sterile catheterization suprapubic aspiration 4.3.3 Procedures follow Study Drug Administration ( Day 3/4 Day 9/10 ) 1 . Record AEs ( definitely probably related study drug ) 72 hour follow last dose study drug 2 . Record SAEs 7 day follow last dose study drug 4.4 Protocol Deviations When deviation protocol deem necessary individual infant , investigator responsible physician must contact study PI immediately , unless delay would endanger subject , timely decision make whether infant enrol continue study . The deviation protocol authorize particular infant . A description departure protocol reason ( ) must record appropriate CRF . Additionally , site adhere local IRB reporting rule protocol deviation . 5.0 Safety 5.1 Adverse Events 5.1.1 Definition Adverse Event An AE define untoward medical occurrence sign ( ) , symptom ( ) , and/or laboratory finding ( ) concurrent use drug human . AEs include worsen baseline symptom . The event may/may necessarily causal relationship administration drug . AEs may report subject , detected investigator , competent observer . The investigator also evaluate change laboratory value . If investigator determines laboratory abnormality clinically significant , consider laboratory AE ; however , laboratory value abnormality consistent current diagnosis , may document accordingly . 5.1.2 Reporting period AEs ( definitely probably related study drug ) record time first dose study drug 72 hour follow last dose study drug . All SAEs record form time first dose study drug 7 day last dose study drug . The AE reporting period extend subject continue ticarcillin-clavulanate follow 6 dos study drug . AEs possibly relate study drug NOT record . 5.1.3 Procedures assess , record report AEs Throughout duration study , investigator closely monitor subject clinical evidence drug intolerance monitor clinically obtain laboratory value laboratory evidence AEs . All SAEs report study 's medical monitor within 24 hour . The description AE include description event , start date , stop date , intensity , serious , relationship study drug . The investigator must verify information . The intensity severity AEs grade follow : - Mild - awareness sign symptom , easily tolerate . Not expect clinically significant effect subject 's overall health well-being . Not likely require medical attention - Moderate - discomfort enough cause interference usual activity affect clinical status . May require medical intervention - Severe - incapacitate significantly affect clinical status . Likely require medical intervention and/or close follow-up AEs increase intensity record stop date AE CRF milder AE equal date condition worsen . A new AE start date equal date worsening report . AEs decrease severity need report way . The start date date enter date resolution report stop date . The Investigator responsible assess relationship study medication use follow definition : - Not relate : An AE due pre-existing illness use another drug , relate study drug . - Possibly relate : An AE little relationship study drug exists likely alternative cause . - Probably relate : An AE likely related administration study drug alternative cause less likely compare study drug . - Definitely Related : An AE strong temporal relationship study drug . AE recur continue repeat use study drug , another cause unlikely less likely . 5.1.4 Follow-up AEs AEs follow resolution stability reach use good clinical practice . 5.2 Serious Adverse Event A SAE define ( 21 Code Federal Regulations part 312.32 ) AEs , meet follow serious outcome criterion : - Is fatal - Is life-threatening , meaning , subject , view investigator , immediate risk death reaction occur , i.e. , include reaction , occur serious form , might cause death ; - Is persistent significant disability/incapacity , i.e. , event cause substantial disruption person 's ability conduct normal life function ; - Requires prolongs inpatient hospitalization ; - Is congenital anomaly/birth defect ; - Is important medical event , base appropriate medical judgment , may jeopardize subject subject may require medical surgical intervention prevent one outcome . 5.2.1 Procedures assess , record report SAEs All SAEs must report facsimile electronic transmission study 's medical monitor within 24 hour onset SAE ( awareness investigator event ) . The study 's medical monitor notifies study PI SAE within one work day receive report clinical site . In addition , clinical site must report death life-threatening event telephone soon possible within 24 hour study 's medical monitor . An SAE CRF must complete sign site investigator . All SAEs must also enter AE CRF ( select `` serious '' ) . The FDA require SAEs unexpected potentially relate study medication must report FDA write within 15 calendar day . SAEs unexpected related study drug meet criterion death immediately life-threatening also require study 's medical monitor notify FDA telephone , facsimile transmission write soon possible later 7 calendar day , follow-up write report within 15 calendar day . The study 's medical monitor prepare expedite report FDA copy distribute site investigator . Expedited report place Study Binder investigator upon receipt . The investigator also forward copy expedite report local Investigational Review Boards accordance local guideline . 5.2.2 Follow-up SAEs All SAEs follow resolution , stabilization 7 day last dose study drug , whichever occur , first . 5.3 Blood Volume PK Safety Laboratory Tests Blood sample volume minimize : 1 . Most hematology chemistry laboratory measure record laboratory draw standard care . Any lab need protocol count total blood volume study . 2 . A limited PK sample scheme employ 1.4 mL blood ( 7 sample ) obtain subject PK analysis . 6.0 Administration 6.1 Trial Termination A data safety group member expertise biostatistics , neonatology , clinical pharmacology , pediatric infectious disease monitor data study AEs , patient safety , potential toxicity . If two subject develop unexpected SAE relate study drug , stop enrollment evaluate data safety product population . Dr. Brian Smith ( neonatologist ) receive SAEs call ad hoc meeting safety group need . 6.2 Investigational Product 6.2.1 Description Investigational Product Ticarcillin-clavulanate sterile injectable antibacterial combination consist semisynthetic antibiotic ticarcillin disodium , β-lactamase inhibitor clavulanate potassium ( potassium salt clavulanic acid ) intravenous administration . Ticarcillin derive basic penicillin nucleus , 6-amino-penicillanic acid . Clavulanic acid produce fermentation Streptomyces clavuligerus . It β-lactam structurally related penicillin possess ability inactivate wide variety β-lactamases block active site enzymes . 6.3 Drug Accountability Study drug provide local site pharmacy .</detailed_description>
