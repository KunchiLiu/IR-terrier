	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well everolimus octreotide acetate without bevacizumab work treat patient pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor remove surgery spread nearby place body . Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Octreotide acetate may interfere slow growth tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Bevacizumab everolimus also may stop growth pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether give everolimus octreotide acetate together effective without bevacizumab treat pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus Octreotide Acetate With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : l. To assess progression-free survival rate patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor treat everolimus alone everolimus plus bevacizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) among treatment arm show efficacious . II . To estimate overall tumor response rate patient metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor treat one two novel regimen . III . To estimate overall biochemical response rate ( measure plasma chromogranin A level ) patient metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor treat regimen . IV . To assess toxicity regimen patient metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor . V. To assess overall survival patient pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive everolimus orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 octreotide acetate intramuscularly ( IM ) day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive everolimus octreotide acetate Arm I . Patients also receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 15 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
