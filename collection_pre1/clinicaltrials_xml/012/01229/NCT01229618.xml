	<brief_summary>Current imaging option assess prostate cancer well . This study combine two magnetic resonance imaging modality , MRI MRSI , order determine utility physicians patient prostate cancer make treatment decision see well various type treatment work . Hyperpolarized pyruvate ( 13C ) investigational product may enhance image capability MRI MRSI . Hyperpolarized pyruvate inject body determine metabolize 's metabolism assess use MR imaging . The purpose study determine safety metabolism hyperpolarized pyruvate human , use increase effectiveness MR imaging regard patient care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyperpolarized Pyruvate Injection Subjects With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1 clinical study investigational medicinal product ( IMP ) , hyperpolarized Pyruvate ( 13C ) Injection . The study include acquisition magnetic resonance ( MR ) data perform men prostate cancer intact prostate . A standard dose-escalation design use ; initially , 6 subject receive IMP dose level . As data dynamic arrival IMP potential image efficacy need dose level , require use separate MR acquisition sequence , modify 3+3 design apply dose cohort . The first 3 subject undergo dynamic 13C image define kinetics delivery metabolism IMP , second 3 subject undergo 13C MR spectroscopic imaging ( MRSI ) obtain 3-dimensional ( 3-D ) spatial information metabolism IMP region prostate without cancer involvement . After apparent maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) establish , expansion 3-D imaging cohort 6 subject ( 9 subject total dose level ) obtain additional information regard safety MTD . If &gt; 2 subject cohort 9 subject experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , next low dose define MTD . At dose level high contrast noise ratio ( dose level less equal MTD ) expansion image cohort include another 15 subject total 18 subject undergo 13C 3-D scan dose , obtain exploratory information concern time course SNR ( signal noise ratio ) presence hyperpolarized [ 1 13C ] pyruvate metabolite region cancer benign prostate tissue . The information provide data use develop MR image protocol future clinical trial seek address sensitivity specificity technology .</detailed_description>
