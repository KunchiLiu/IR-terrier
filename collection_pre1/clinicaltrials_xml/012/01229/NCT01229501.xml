	<brief_summary>Endothelial dysfunction , abnormal function line blood vessel , appear key process development cardiovascular disease . Endothelial dysfunction appear caused sleep disorder breathing obesity . As endothelial dysfunction among first clinical marker predict future cardiovascular event , understand molecular mechanism lead impairment endothelial function important . Endothelial function require proper function endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) . eNOS activity tightly regulate caveolin-1 , protein important formation cellular structure call caveolae . Low level caveolin-1 facilitate optimal nitric oxide synthesis endothelial cell caveolin-1 help spatially organize eNOS close proximity signal protein important eNOS activation . In certain disease however , balance caveolin-1 eNOS disrupt result impaired nitric oxide synthesis lead endothelial dysfunction . The investigator therefore seek characterize level caveolin-1 , correlate presence absence sleep disorder breathing , obesity , cardiovascular disease . The current IRB protocol cover performance fat biopsy subject recently complete sleep study either Center Sleep Medicine sleep laboratory find sleep disordered breathe sleep disorder breathing , subject sleep disorder breathing treat successfully continuous positive airway pressure 3-6 month , subject undergo study lab obese non-obese subject know cardiovascular disease subject without know cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>
