	<detailed_description>Actinic keratoses ( AK ) common cutaneous lesion associate chronic ultraviolet radiation exposure . Ultraviolet radiation produce local systemic immunosuppression , mutation p53 tumor suppressor gene , deoxyribonucleic acid pyrimidine covalent dimmer , believe contribute dysplasia see AK . While authority consider AK pre-malignant lesion , consider incipient squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) . The risk progression SCC individual AK reportedly low highly variable ; however , patient often multplie AKs , overall risk progression lifetime significant ; thus treatment AKs warrant . In addition , skin around clinically obvious AK lesion subject chronic ultraviolet exposure , result genetic damage mutation , result `` field cancerization . '' Subclinical AKs may progress clinical AKs , even de novo invasive SCCs . Among current therapy treatment AK excisional surgery , cryosurgery , electrodessication curettage , topical chemotherapy light therapy . With provider-administered device , temperature utilize , time contact , variation administration , influence efficacy treatment . Efficacy improve increase freeze time , often associate great discomfort , severe skin necrosis , increase risk post-treatment hypopigmentation . In addition , lesion-directed therapy , cryosurgery treat subclinical lesion surround skin . Treated lesion clearance rate 3 month post-treatment double-freeze thaw cryotherapy report around 76-88 % ; however , new lesion treatment field include . Overall lesion clearance rate , include new subclinical lesion , approximately 5 month post-cryosurgery report 35-51 % . There limited information long-term AK clearance rate cryosurgery report differ method calculation . In study compare cyrotherapy , imiquimod 5-fluorouracil , 12 month post cryotherapy 28 % ( 7/25 ) complete clearance baseline lesion undergone cryotherapy , 4 % ( 1/25 ) complete clearance treatment field . Imiquimod topical immune response modifier activate innate immune system via Toll-like receptor 7 , well enhance acquire immune system . A 5 % topical formulation approve treatment AKs US 2x/week 16 week regimen Europe 3x/week 4 week regimen 1 2 course therapy . Topical imiquimod treatment may also reduce subclinical lesion treatment area , result few `` new '' AK lesion develop period time compare focal treatment . In comparison cryosurgery versus imiquimod treatment AKs , Krawtchenko et al report initial complete clearance rate 68 85 % clinical assessment , respectively . However , treatment field sustain clearance rate 4 % versus 73 % , respectively . Tan et al report application imiquimod vehicle follow cryosurgery result comparable target AK clearance rate 12 week 79 % versus 76 % , respectively , imiquimod group few total AKs few subclinical AKs . The imiquimod 5 % formulation limitation treatment AKs . It approve treatment small area skin ( 25 cm2 ) , use less intuitive 2 time per week ( 2x/week ) dosing schedule , prolonged treatment period ( 16 week ) . Dosing frequently 3x/week imiquimod 5 % cream well tolerated subject AK . Imiquimod cream concentration 3.75 % find Phase 3 study superior placebo cream respect clearance AKs use regimen 2 packet ( 250 mg cream per packet , 500 mg total ) apply daily entire face ( approximately 200 cm2 ) two 2-week treatment cycle separate 2-week no-treatment period .</detailed_description>
