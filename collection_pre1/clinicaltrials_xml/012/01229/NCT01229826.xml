	<brief_summary>The purpose study gain additional information regard use Magnetic Resonance Elastography ( MRE ) uterine fibroid characterization . In study , investigator use new noninvasive technology , MRE , characterize elastic property uterine fibroid . To date , little known concern tissue composition uterine fibroid may affect treatment Magnetic Resonance Guided Focused Ultrasound ( MRgFUS ) . In study , investigator use new noninvasive technology , magnetic resonance elastography ( MRE ) , characterize elastic property uterine fibroid . This information gather routine magnetic resonance image symptomatic uterine fibroid . It known fibroid increase T2-signal Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) difficult treat . This information gather routine magnetic resonance image symptomatic uterine fibroid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-site , non-randomized pilot study determine whether Magnetic Resonance Elastography ( MRE ) optimize clinical use part patient routine clinical imaging correlate MR signal characteristic uterine fibroid . MRE perform end examination standard Magnetic Resonance Imaging protocol . Aims : Specific Aim 1 : To acquire magnetic resonance elastography image woman clinically order pelvic magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) uterine fibroid . Specific Aim 2 : To examine correlation MRE stiffness value MR T2 signal characteristic uterine fibroid . For subset patient go surgery correlation pathology also perform . This study seek determine whether MRE perform pelvis routine clinical basis well correlate MRE finding magnetic resonance signal characteristic . There additional risk patient additional cost MRI exam .</detailed_description>
