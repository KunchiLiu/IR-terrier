	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give cediranib maleate together combination chemotherapy work treat patient advanced biliary cancer . Cediranib maleate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving cediranib maleate together combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate AZD2171 ( cediranib maleate ) modify folinic acid-fluorouracil-oxaliplatin-6 regimen ( FOLFOX 6 ) subject advance biliary cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall assessment toxicity AZD2171 modify FOLFOX6 . II . To determine progression-free survival subject advance biliary cancer treat AZD2171 modify FOLFOX6 . III . To determine overall survival subject advance biliary cancer treat AZD2171 modify FOLFOX6 . OUTLINE : Patients receive cediranib maleate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-14 modified FOLFOX6 comprise oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV 46 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
