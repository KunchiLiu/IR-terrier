	<detailed_description>Cross-sectional study Northern America , Northern Europe Asia indicate increase prevalence severity asthma obese whereas longitudinal study indicate increase BMI associate increase risk incident asthma woman . However , mechanisms where-by obesity increase risk asthma remain unclear . There study North America Asia suggest obesity associate increase skin test reactivity atopic diseases many suggest obesity association atopy . In adult asthmatic , also show medical surgical weight loss consistently associate dramatic improvement lung function , asthma symptom , medication usage . However , child study elaborate potential benefit reduce weight . Total fat intake also associate diagnosis asthma . N-3 fatty acid note inversely correlate body fat , level N-6 fatty acid correlate positively body fat . Increased dietary intake N-3 fatty acid ( eicosapentaenoic acid ) ( mainly fish oil ) generally associate protection asthma , intake N-6 fatty acid ( linoleic acid ) may increase asthma risk , although remain controversial . Linoleic acid may act precursor arachidonic acid subsequently serve precursor 4-series leukotrienes highly active mediator inflammation . There two study investigate level exhale nitric oxide ( ENO ) indicator airway inflammation relation obesity asthma . One study show significant increase ENO increase BMI healthy adult . However , level ENO exhale leukotriene B4 recently find increased lean obese asthmatic child relate BMI 's . In Southern European country , representative epidemiological data contribution obesity asthma burden . In area world , also study effect important lifestyle factor include diet physical activity association adiposity asthma pathophysiology . In addition , information exists level airway inflammation non-asthmatics asthmatic subject relation body content fat impact weight reduction airway inflammation . In year 2001-2003 , national health survey conduct Cyprus focus nutrition physical fitness child age 11-12 year ( attend 6th form primary school ) . With project propose approach group child year 2007-2009 investigate follow hypothesis : AIMS : The aim study follow : Part I To investigate association asthma prevalence age 15-17 body mass index ( BMI ) age 15-17 independently BMI age 11-12 year Part II To investigate association BMI age 16-18 independently BMI age 11-12 year : 1 . Prevalence allergic sensitization 2 . Lung function 3 . Levels airway inflammation age 16-18 year 4 . Severity asthma Secondly , assess diet physical activity involvement effect modifier possible association . PART I METHODOLOGY : Study population Part I take place month January 2007 June 2007 child attend 1st ( 15-16 year ) 2nd ( 16-17 year ) class public private Lyceia school across Republic Cyprus invite participate . The targeted population 19849 child participate earlier study year 2001-3 amongst assessment anthropometric measurement , assessment cardio-respiratory fitness serum lipid take time . For assessment child 's asthma status use Greek version ISAAC ( International Study Asthma Allergies Childhood ) core questionnaire supplement question relate potential person-based risk factor place birth child , ethnic origin parent , birth order , parental education level , parental smoking , history atopy immediate family ( siblings parent history asthma , eczema hay fever ) , personal uptake smoking , pet ownership place residence . All participate student also weight , percentage body fat Body Mass Index ( BMI ) measure . The subject ' BMI classify normal weight , overweight obese accord sex age specific cut-offs ( six month interval ) , suggest International Obesity Task Force ( IOTF ) . Compilation Dataset An effort match subject 2007 cross-sectional database subject 2001-2002 old cross-sectional database carry use various match parameter . A dataset 5384 subject construct match BMI value 2007 ( age 15-17 year ) 2001-2003 ( age 11-12 year ) . Statistical Analysis Using answer basic question asthma respiratory morbidity ISAAC questionnaire case definition refine : 1 . Active asthma : positive answer question ever asthma current wheeze night time cough unrelated cold past 12 month 2 . Inactive asthma : positive answer question ever asthma negative answer question current wheeze night time cough unrelated cold past 12 month 3 . Respiratory symptom without asthma : negative answer question ever asthma positive answer ( ) question current wheeze night time cough unrelated cold past 12 month . The association disease outcomes obesity predictor ( BMI z-score body fat % ) , analyzed univariate analysis odds ratio ( OR ) calculate 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) . In addition univariate analysis , multiple logistic regression also perform investigate association obesity predictor disease outcomes adjust confounders stratify significant effect modifier . Statistical significance set P &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
