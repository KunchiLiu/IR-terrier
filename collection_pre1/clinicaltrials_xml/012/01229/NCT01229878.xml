	<brief_summary>This double-blind placebo control pilot study determine vitamin D supplementation hemodialysis ( HD ) patient improve physical function cognition . HD patient high prevalence vitamin D deficiency , cognitive impairment , physical impairment . Despite standard clinical care active IV vitamin D dialysis , HD patient still markedly low level nutritional dietary vitamin D. IV treatment vitamin D dialysis aim treat HD related bone disease . Recent literature show oral nutritional vitamin D multiple extra-skeletal effect include improvement cognition physical function . In study , investigator plan administer oral vitamin D vitamin D deficient HD patient already receive standard care IV vitamin D therapy . Patients randomize receive either placebo 50,000 IU vitamin D ( cholecalciferol ) weekly 6 month . The investigator ' specific aim 1 ) Assess benefit correct nutritional vitamin D deficiency cognitive physical function HD patient receive routine standard care , 2 ) Assess feasibility recruit HD patient study , 3 ) Evaluate propose regimen safely effectively increase nutritional vitamin D level oral supplementation . The investigator anticipate correction nutritional vitamin D deficiency optimal level improve high prevalence cognitive impairment physical impairment population . These result use evidence support large study aim treat nutritional vitamin D deficiency patient receive HD . These result may also contribute change current guideline place little emphasis monitoring treatment nutritional vitamin D level HD patient . These result important Veteran dialysis population since many require perform high-level cognitive task management complex medical regimen physical task orchestrate independent transportation HD session multiple physician appointment .</brief_summary>
