	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Cediranib maleate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether carboplatin paclitaxel effective give without cediranib maleate treat patient cervical cancer remove surgery . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study give carboplatin paclitaxel together cediranib maleate see well work compare give carboplatin paclitaxel together placebo treat patient metastatic recurrent cervical cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin Paclitaxel With Without Cediranib Maleate Treating Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Cervical Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To provide preliminary evidence regard whether addition cediranib maleate combination carboplatin paclitaxel increase progression-free survival 50 % 4 6 month patient metastatic recurrent , undetectable cervical carcinoma . Secondary - To provide estimate difference response , survival , toxicity , quality life , pharmacodynamic end-points study arm . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive carboplatin IV 30-60 minute paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 . Patients also receive oral placebo daily . - Arm II : Patients receive carboplatin paclitaxel therapy Arm I . Patients also receive oral cediranib maleate daily . In arm , treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete response , partial response , stable disease follow completion therapy receive cediranib maleate placebo evidence progression toxicity . Blood sample may collect periodically evaluation VEGFR signal inhibitor cediranib maleate identification suitable biomarkers predict cediranib maleate response . Quality-of-life assess EORTC QLQ-C30 QLQ-CX24 cervix subscale questionnaire baseline periodically study follow . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 2 month 3 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK .</detailed_description>
