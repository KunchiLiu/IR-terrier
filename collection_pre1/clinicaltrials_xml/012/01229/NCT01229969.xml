	<detailed_description>Accidental fall old adult highly prevalent major source morbidity . Over 30 % people age 65 old fall year half case recurrent . Falls may result head trauma , bone fracture , even death lead cause nonfatal fatal injury older adult . Falls also costly . An estimate $ 20 billion dollar annually spend hip fracture associate fall ; amount project rise next decade . Risk factor fall elderly usually multi-factorial . These include increase age , environmental factor , acute chronic illness , medication use , cognitive impairment , sensory deficit , balance gait impairment . The Nintendo Wii Fit system engage , low-cost , standardize may feasible exercise modality improve balance elderly . While virtual reality use research context new , study commercially available low-cost video game virtual reality capability do . These demonstrate encouraging result , indicate potential use rehabilitation child adult . Twenty ambulatory old individual age 60 old reside community recruit participate study.This group participant select represent general community dwell old adult much possible . They demonstrate wide range ability term balance mobility healthy ( non-fallers ) , risk fall , faller . Efforts make equal distribution among three group . Subjects consent research study ask question age , gender , educational background , medical history , fall past year . They also evaluate clinically actual study ass vision , cognitive status , balance . Qualified subject randomize two study group one group begin study Wii Fit test follow NeuroCom EquiTest evaluation group reverse order . This counterbalancing subject design negate potential order effect . Balance data collect NeuroCom EquiTest compare performance score obtain play two Wii Fit balance game determine whether performance score two Wii Fit balance game indicative participant ' balance ability.All study intervention complete 1 day session .</detailed_description>
