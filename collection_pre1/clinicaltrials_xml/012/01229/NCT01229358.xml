	<detailed_description>Rationale : One common post-operative complication surgical procedure remain surgical site infection , cause significant morbidity healthcare cost ( estimate $ 1.5 billion per year ) among hospitalized patient . Surgical wound low extremity revascularization particularly prone infection dehiscence , rate series high 44 % ( Kent , Bartek et al . 1996 ) . Currently , Guideline Prevention Surgical Site Infection recommend use sterile dress protect close incision 24 48 hour postoperatively . However , evidence-based recommendation make regard dress type use post-operative incision care . A plethora wound dressing available market , silver-based dressing among recent innovation . Topical silver treatment effective bactericidal agent induce bacterial resistance use therapeutic level . Acticoat Absorbent速 ( Smith Nephew , Inc. ) , antimicrobial barrier dress coat nanocrystalline silver delivers control , sustain ( three day ) dose silver ion . Additionally , dress absorbs moisture ( minimize wound maceration ) , safe effective broad range microorganism . Acticoat Absorbent速 ( Acticoat ) indicate surgical wound , chronic wound , burn wound ; however , data lack regard potential role postoperative surgical incision wound infection prophylaxis . The Principal Investigator recently complete non-concurrent , single-institution study patient receive conventional non-silver contain dress Acticoat post-operative dressing follow define low extremity revascularizations ( Childress , Berceli et al . 2007 ) . The study population comprise 216 patient underwent 248 case meet inclusion criterion . Both group similar regard age time first procedure , gender , race , diabetes , hypertension , current smoking , renal insufficiency ( creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/L ) . Furthermore , group tissue loss common indication lower extremity revascularization procedure , 47 % ( 55/118 ) control group 38 % ( 49/130 ) treatment group . Moreover , autogenous vein bypass graft common procedure perform control ( 65/118 , 55 % procedure ) treatment ( 54/130 , 42 % procedure ) group . The surgeon provider find dress regimen easy apply care post-operatively . Revascularization pulse could palpate dress , low profile permit identification post-operative soft tissue change hematomas . Compressive ace bandage could apply without disturb original dressing . Regarding primary finding , substantial dress material specific complication note , include apparent allergic reaction . The wound complication rate control group 14 % ( 17/118 ) , treatment group 5 % ( 7/130 ) . Over intervention phase , wound overall complication rate fell 64 % ( c2 = 5.76 , df = 1 , p = 0.016 ) . These finding provide clinical evidence Acticoat base dress system offer potentially efficacious , cost-effective adjunct reduce surgical site infection low extremity revascularization . Based data , believe investigation via multi-center randomized clinical trial warrant . Thus current proposal hypothesize immediate application Acticoat Absorbent速 post-operative dressing would reduce close incisional wound complication patient undergo low extremity revascularizations involve infrainguinal skin incision result clinically significant reduction wound complication rate compare standard non-silver elute dress material . Procedure : - Patient randomize OR wound closure complete - Wound closure technique discretion surgeon ( Dermabond dress utilized ) - Final OR dress test ( silver vs standard ) dressing , secure per surgeon preference - Original OR dressing stay place gross soil impairs standard wound hygiene , clinical need remove , POD # 3 , whichever come first - Subsequent dressing , wound care discretion provider - Visual wound check least 2 4 week ( +/- 5 day ) Clinical , economic , patient quality life , resource utilization data collect standard clinical encounter Primary Endpoint : Any wound complication within 30 day Power Sample Size Calculations : - Current endpoint rate least 25 % ( Kent , Bartek et al . 1996 ; Nguyen , Brahmanandam et al . 2007 ) - Anticipate 10 % absolute ( 40 % relative ) wound complication rate reduction ( Childress , Berceli et al . 2007 ) - Power 0.8 - alpha 0.05 - control event rate 0.25 - treatment event rate 0.15 - 1:1 randomization - -- &gt; total study sample size 250 per group ( 500 total ) .</detailed_description>
