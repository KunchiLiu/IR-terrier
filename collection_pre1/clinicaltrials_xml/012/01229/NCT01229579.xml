	<brief_summary>Pakistan one 4 develop country case poliomyelitis still identify . Despite incessant effort WHO UNICEF , disease far control . There need develop new innovative strategy contain disease eradicate country new case continue identify . Zinc essential component score enzymes human body . Recent report indicate trace element along micronutrient enhances protective function immune cell . Moreover , zinc deficiency lead dysregulation balance host response infection result decrease antibody production suppress immunity . Zinc also essential cofactor thymulin know modulate cytokine release induce immune cell proliferation . Zinc deficiency also find impair individual 's epithelial barrier function , may depress vaccine entry mucosal cell . Role zinc prevention diarrheal diseases infection child well document . However , report contribution enhance immunity support body 's natural defense system . Zinc insufficiency widespread socioeconomically deprive child South Asia recent national nutrition survey ( 2003 ) . Moreover , diarrhea also common infant Pakistan . Such diarrheal episode limit entry attenuate polio virus mucosal cell , thereby , lead inadequate immune response . Association recent diarrheal history increase vaccine failure infant show study Brazil . The recent Lancet Nutrition series also recommend regular zinc supplementation address child undernutrition stunt underscored need treat diarrheal episode zinc expedite recovery . Other recent study zinc supplementation low birth weight infant South Asia also show significant improvement diarrheal disease burden mortality . On basis line evidence , possible case vaccine failure region could consequence compromise immunity , hence , diminish response OPV . This could potentially reverse address gross undernutrition micronutrient deficiency . It thus hypothesize zinc supplementation community scale would enhance immune response infant OPV . In order test research question , investigator propose undertake 12-month randomize controlled trial among cohort Pakistani infants 0-14 day age . Such trial would enable u understand synergistic role zinc ( ) OPV enhance immune response polio sero-conversion rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Zinc Supplementation Response Oral Polio Vaccine Infants Pakistan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose carry randomize controlled clinical trial Pakistan ass efficacy zinc supplementation first 18 week life seroconversion due OPV . Infants 0-14 day age recruit randomized 2 group ; group would receive respective OPV dose accord EPI schedule , intervention group , addition , would receive 10 mg elemental zinc daily basis , 18 week , start age 14 day . At 18 week ( 4 week last OPV ) , investigator provide additional dose bOPV challenge collect stool sample 0 7 day delivery bOPV . Study settings The rural settlement Hala ( population ~ 200,000 ) , locate 200 km north-east Karachi , Pakistan would select study site , high proportion at-risk 5 child reside area . The large proportion population fall low socioeconomic group , accord recently conduct census 2008 , make site eminently suitable test trial hypothesis . The Department Pediatrics &amp; Child Health , AKU establish liaison community member local government stakeholder , research office locate district-level tertiary care hospital . The nearby vaccination center would assist deliver OPV dos , accord EPI schedule , along EPI vaccine . The tertiary health care center ( Taluka Hospital , Hala ) would provide place evaluation treatment unforeseen adverse reaction / event , free cost . Study population The trial would recruit full term healthy infant either sex soon birth randomize supplementation soon possible birth ( within 72 hour tandem first OPV dose ) . Infants beyond age preterm infant ( &lt; 37 week gestation &lt; 2 kg birth weight ) would exclude . Sampling strategy Eligible subject would identify randomized respective intervention comparative group use computer generate three cell block randomization permutation table . Group A : Standard OPV schedule oral zinc supplement ( 10 mg zinc sulfate liquid preparation ) daily 18 week . Group B : Will receive standard OPV schedule standard care . An identical placebo preparation , similar taste , color consistency also administer daily 18 week . The group would receive standard OPV dose birth , 6 week , 10 week 14 week age , recommend expand program immunization ( EPI ) . As practice WHO UNICEF , OPV dos would also administer cohort , polio mass vaccination campaign , schedule twice every 3 month . The zinc placebo preparation administer equal volume ( 2.5 ml daily ) , prepared Atco Laboratories Limited , one lead pharmaceutical industry Pakistan . . They would hold allocation code , replenish supply fortnightly interval maintain consumption record . The research monitoring staff fully blind preparation . Given need follow individual level response , investigator choose individual randomize trial oppose cluster randomize trial . The investigator shall employ computerized block randomization strategy group match block 20 , code maintain Atco Laboratories Limited Chair AKU ERC . Trained field worker visit household , 2 time week ass compliance assign intervention respective time schedule , motivate family evaluate child per standard format . For recruit research study , incentive would provide form soap cloth provide field team visit household collection blood sample study subject . These select view immediate need recruit child reside area Hala year formative research comparable project rural Sindh . These incentive deliberately keep modest pose undue incentive participation . The health worker would replenish zinc placebo supply every 12 day ( 30 ml bottle ) . Enrollment participant Sample size estimate There scarcity research indicate seroconversion rate OPV among infant reside rural population Pakistan . The investigator assume conservative estimate seroconversion OPV among infant till 14 week age rural population Pakistan would 50 % . These seroconversion rate consistent low limit OPV seroconversion rate observe among breastfed young infant one solitary study subject Pakistan . To detect 20 % improvement seroconversion rate upon zinc administration , investigator would require minimum 242 subject ( 121 subject occupy group ) 5 % level significance 90 % power . Estimating 30 % maximum dropout refusal rate comparable study involve serological testing , investigator would require total 320 subject , 160 subject occupy group . Identification inform consent A cohort pregnant woman ( third trimester ) would identify baseline census subsequent update surveillance period . The investigator identify birth within 24 hour birth information system employ assistance Lady Health Workers ( LHWs ) area traditional birth attendant ( TBAs ) . Families visit prior birth sensitize study provide information sheet . Following notification birth , family visit informed consent seek prior initial randomization . The recruited infant family visit , 3 time per week ass morbidity growth ( height , weight , mid-arm circumference head circumference ) . Close liaison would maintain local vaccination center , OPV dose would administer infant accord EPI schedule Immunization . Efforts would make research staff maintain record vaccination recruit cohort , along date subsequent vaccination . Surveillance data collection A research team would assemble , constitute research supervisor , field supervisor , research medical officer , phlebotomist community health worker . For census update , data collector capable visit least 30 household per day ; thus census update could cover month ' time . Recruitment subject trial could get cover less 2 month . For trial activity , least 8 team would delegate , cover least 40 household per day . Each household ( bear one potential subject ) would visit 2 time week . A 3-day training program would impart familiarize research protocol , field operation activity census/survey research trial measure complete form . A series data collection form would draft ( initially English ; translate Urdu Sindhi languages ) collect information entire research period . A case recruitment form ( CRF ) would draft , would fill research medical officer would bear questions/items birth history , immunization status , medical history , anthropometry physical examination . The subject would follow regular basis ( 2 time week ) research appoint community health worker minimum qualification matriculation ( grade 10 education ) , use pre-defined follow form . The CHWs record data immunization status , medical history management ailment ( especially diarrhea ) , anthropometric assessment medical examination , laboratory test result ( blood serology ELISA ) . Immunization status recruit would maintain every OPV dose provide recruited infant . The data would collect CHWs regular follow ups area assessment vaccination record finger mark campaign . A supplementation form would maintain regularly ensure compliance group replenish . This would record community health worker undertake household surveillance . All form would bear general information child intervention code allot Atco laboratory . Research medical officer , addition lead field team , would also entrust oversee untoward events/reactions , among study subject . These would bring notice circulate CHWs . If encounter , adverse event would document follow clinically appropriate treatment . If child , outside recruit cohort identify need health care , CHWs may refer child Taluka Hospital , Hala . Laboratory Analysis Blood sample ( approximately 3 ml cubital fossa either arm ) would collect birth , 6 week 18 week age recruit infant , phlebotomists relevant experience draw blood among infant . The blood sample would analyze polio seroconversion rate . Neutralizing antibody would determine use method recommend WHO [ 9 ] . The investigator evaluate antibody response OPV serotype close collaboration CDC ( Atlanta ) . A subset sample also locally test ELISA determine sensitivity specificity ELISA compare gold standard neutralization assay detect polio antibody . In order investigate impact zinc immune response OPV , investigator would determine status zinc ( serum level ) infant group . These would determine blood sample collect birth , 6 week 18 week age analyze use atomic absorption spectrophotometry use establish micromethods . Other micronutrient indicator influence systemic mucosal immunity ( hemoglobin , ferritin vitamin A ) would also analyze collect blood specimen recruit subject . The blood sample would collect field transport Nutrition Research Laboratory , Department Pediatrics &amp; Child Health , AKU . A transport mechanism well establish brings blood biological sample Hala/Matiari field site main laboratory AKU daily basis . To save cost mechanism would also employ transportation blood sample Research Laboratory AKU . Study duration The study expect last total 12 month ; initial 3 month census activity field preparation training activity , 6 month actual research trial , inclusive recruitment , intervention , follow laboratory test last 3 month finalization data analysis preparation final report . In addition , investigator collect stool sample 0 7 day delivery bOPV . The stool sample would collect field transport National Institute Health ( NIH ) , Pakistan process accord standard protocol use global polio laboratory network , include poliovirus isolation , ITD sequence . Non-polio enterovirus ( NPEV ) isolate characterize . A transport mechanism well establish brings stool biological sample Hala/Matiari field site Aga Khan University daily basis , sample store shipment NIH ( WHO Regional Polio Network Laboratory ) Islamabad . Study variables - Outcome variable : Seroconversion rate polio virus ( type 1 type 3 ) , blood sample collect time recruitment , 6 week 18 week , prevalence excretion poliovirus serotypes 1 , 3 0 7 day administration bOPV - Other variable : Data would collect birth history , immunization status , medical history management , number rate diarrheal episode , breast feeding practice , laboratory nutritional index , anthropometric measurement ( weight age , weight height height age ) , physical examination vital sign , laboratory parameter , like serum zinc , C-reactive protein , polio virus seroconversion rate , etc . Statistical analyse The collect data would dual enter data base develop use Foxpro , analysis use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) version 18 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) . Frequencies continuous variable would express mean ± standard deviation . Proportions would calculate categorical outcome . Means would compare use paired t-test . Chi square test independence would employ determine difference association . Differences seroconversion rate prevalence excretion , , would evaluate use ANOVA non-parametric test . Multiple logistic regression analysis undertaken determine nature relationship serum zinc status optimal vaccine seroconversion .</detailed_description>
