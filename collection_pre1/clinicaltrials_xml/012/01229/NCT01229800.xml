	<brief_summary>: In several study compare sodium phosphate solution versus PEG , regimen similar efficacy bowel cleanse sodium phosphate solution acceptable patient patient require consume small volume . But sodium phosphate solution associate fluid electrolyte disturbance , use sodium phosphate solution routine medical check-up outpatient problematic . PEG provide rapid peroral approach colon lavage without cause fluid electrolyte disturbance . However , need ingest large volume fluid reduce patient compliance , result suboptimal bowel preparation . In order overcome disadvantage , several study prove split dose PEG regimens good quality preparation acceptable single dose regimen . In Korea , need outpatient screen colonoscopy without laboratory test increase split dose PEG use frequently country bowel preparation safety . But , superiority split dose PEG sodium phosphate solution demonstrate . The study yet exist comparison split dose PEG solution sodium phosphate solution bowel cleanse tolerability colonoscopy preparation . To use split dose PEG bowel preparation medical evidence , want demonstrate split dose bowel preparation PEG compare sodium phosphate solution provide good colon cleanse efficacy similar tolerability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : Investigator-blinded , prospective , randomize control trial Subjects 1 . Entry criterion : Adult outpatient ( least 18 year age , 65 year ) undergo schedule colonoscopy screening , cancer surveillance want procedure with/without non-specific gastrointestinal symptom . 2 . Exclusion criterion : age 18 year , elderly patient ( &gt; 65 yr ) , pregnancy , breast feeding , patient bowel obstruction , structural intestinal disorder , gut hypomotility ( chronic constipation ( &lt; 2 bowel movement/week 1yr ) , hypomotility syndrome , megacolon , idiopathic pseudoobstruction ) , renal failure , congestive heart failure , liver failure , pre-existing electrolyte disturbance ( hypercalcemia , hyperphosphatemia ) ; refusal consent participate study . Sampling design : Consecutive recruitment consent patient Variables Predictor : split dose PEG sodium phosphate Primary Outcome : Quality bowel preparation ( Ottawa scale ) Secondary Outcome : Tolerability ( preparation completion , side effect ) Confounding variable : age , gender , BMI , experience colonoscopy , surgical history , bowel movement , comorbidity , indication , presence GI symptom , medication Statistical issue Hypothesis : Split dose bowel preparation PEG provide good quality preparation similar tolerability sodium phosphate morning colonoscopy . Sample size . : Improving rate 20 % bowel cleanse efficacy ( Ottawa scale ) , study power 80 % , alpha-error ( level significance , P-value ) 5 % , mean value scale=5 , effect size 1 , SD=2.5- &gt; sample size= 100/100</detailed_description>
