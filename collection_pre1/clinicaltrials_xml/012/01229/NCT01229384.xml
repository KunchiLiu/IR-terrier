	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : That administration nebulized therapy bronchiolitis use positive airway pressure superior standard mask ventilation reduce hospital admission . Bronchiolitis low respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ) syndrome cause variety different virus . It common LRTI child 24 month old . Multiple study document variation treatment , hospitalization rate , length hospital stay bronchiolitis , suggest lack consensus opportunity improve care common disorder . Research determine optimal delivery method respiratory medication may augment oxygenation decrease atelectasis ( Lung cell collapse ) increase oxygen saturation do . Currently bronchodilator deliver passive process , inhale nebulized ( make liquid gas ) face mask . This study evaluate whether use newly develop positive pressure nebulization device use pressure expand lung cell , hypothetically , deliver medication well , improve oxygenation reduce atelectasis ( lung cell collapse ) decrease hospitalization infant moderate severe bronchiolitis . Positive pressure nebulization relatively new adaptation previously exist modality , already currently use PCH .</brief_summary>
