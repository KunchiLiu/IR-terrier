	<brief_summary>The main aim phase II proposal continue complete development cellular phone-based system assist patient medication adherence . Adherence report develop feedback patient provider . Software patient report four day recall adherence text message short message service ( SMS ) interactive voice response ( IVR ) built . An initial qualitative study evaluate adherence report , 4-day adherence recall , inform development content reminder text message could resistant user fatigue . A redesigned system test 3-week longitudinal study 15 patient human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV/AIDS ) . An intervention module analytics engine track adherence level personalize delivery reminder message . A clinic appointment module perform patient appointment reminder . The final system module test 24-week efficacy study . A total 115 patient provider involve three user study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ARemind : A Personalized System Remind Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific study aim describe : 1 . Organize Design , Evaluation , Implementation Teams : The development ARemind guide design , evaluation implementation team . The design team build software architecture execute software development input user study . The evaluation team prepare institutional review board ( IRB ) submission , develop qualitative instrument , analyze qualitative quantitative data . The implementation team guide clinical commercial design aspect include input remote adherence assessment , intervention clinic appointment module , commercialization plan . 2 . Run first user study qualitative assessment patient provider preference ARemind : A web-based adherence report provider develop . Software modules assess adherence phone 4-day SMS IVR recall create along protocol perform phone-based unannounced pill count . The interface test part in-depth qualitative semi-structured interview 15 provider 15 patient guide system design . 3 . Study content preference second user study : A new version ARemind ( version 2.0 ) build base feedback first user study . It include three remote adherence assessment module . It test longitudinally 3 week 15 patient HIV/AIDS . The patient use Medication Event Monitoring System ( MEMS ) software , form MEMS cap , weekly clinic visit adherence counselor generate composite adherence score visit . MEMS cap electronic device attach pill bottle detect record time bottle open close , use estimate number pill take . These compare adherence score remote adherence assessment module . The patient give qualitative feedback visit reminder message guide design content resistant user fatigue . 4 . Explore feasibility ARemind third user study : An intervention module analytics engine build . It personalize reminder message base adherence level facilitate patient phone call social workers/adherence counselor appropriate . A clinic appointment reminder module create interfaced health information exchange Boston Medical Center ( BMC ) . A new version ARemind ( version 3.0 ) contain new module content improve base upon second study . ARemind 3.0 test 24-week longitudinal study 70 patient . Thirty five patient randomize use cell phone ARemind 3.0 ( intervention ) 35 patient use beeper ( control ) . Patients use MEMS cap composite adherence score do 9 adherence visit study . Analysis feasibility , efficacy , user-fatigue cost-savings improve adherence medication clinic appointment perform aim . NOTE : OF THESE THREE USER STUDIES , THE FIRST TWO ARE CONSIDERED FEASIBILITY STUDIES WHILE THE LAST IS A MORE LONGITUDINAL CLINICAL STUDY . THIS REGISTRATION IN CLINICALTRIALS.GOV DEALS WITH THE THIRD USER STUDY , WHICH IS THE LONGEST , INVOLVES THE MOST PARTICIPANTS , AND DEMONSTRATES THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF INTERVENTIONS .</detailed_description>
