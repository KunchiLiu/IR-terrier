	<detailed_description>Darifenacin muscarinic receptor antagonist drug use treat overactive bladder . There new formulation darifenacin extend release develop argentinian pharmaceutical company . A bioequivalence study perform validate pharmaceutical development introduce product market . The purpose study evaluate relative bioavailability , pharmacokinetic profiling safety brand generic formulation darifenacin [ Darisec ( R ) 7.5 mg ] vs. innovator [ Enablex ( R ) 7.5 mg ] 24 healthy uruguayan volunteer high fat breakfast 1000 calorie ( 50 % fat , 35 % carbohydrate , 15 % protein ) establish average bioequivalence . The bioequivalence evaluate use : - The Area Under Curve ( AUC ) , - The peak plasma concentration ( Cmax ) . The pharmacokinetic characteristic drug formulation describe calculate : - The time peak concentration ( Tmax ) - The elimination constant ( Ke ) - The elimination half-life ( t1/2e ) - The systemic clearance ( Cls ) Safety evaluate recording : - Reported adverse event - Vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , body temperature ) - Laboratory analysis ( hemogram , hepatic enzyme , creatinine , sugar blood , etc . ) - EKG chest XRays Bioequivalence claim drug comply local FDA regulatory requirement : - Mean AUCt/AUCr 90 % confidence interval within 0.80-1.25 - Mean Cmaxt/Cmaxr 90 % confidence interval within 0.80-1.25 Pharmacokinetic profiling evaluate describe pharmacokinetic characteristic drug adequate two-way table . Safety evaluate compare incidence adverse events/adverse effect product .</detailed_description>
