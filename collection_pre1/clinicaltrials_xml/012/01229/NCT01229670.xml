	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) major increasingly common cardiovascular syndrome , end result many cardiovascular disorder . It report HF patient pharmacological therapy often remain burdened dyspnea fatigue , diminish exercise tolerance , reduce quality life , recurrent hospitalization , early mortality . HF associate neurohumoral change body attempt reverse effect reduce cardiac output organ perfusion .

Physical training beneficial effect neurohumoral , inflammatory , metabolic central hemodynamic response , well endothelial , skeletal muscle cardiovascular function , lead improvement functional capacity quality life . All training-induced change effectively counteract progression deleterious compensatory mechanism HF . Which exercise intensity yield maximal beneficial adaptation controversial . Several line evidence suggest great aerobic cardiovascular adaptation high-intensity exercise low moderate level patient coronary artery disease leave ventricular dysfunction function healthy subject . Aerobic interval training ( AIT ) involve period 90 % VO2peak show rescue impaired cardiomyocyte contractility , attenuate myocardial hypertrophy , reduce myocardial expression atrial natriuretic peptide animal model post-infarction heart failure . However , underlie mechanism AIT-improved regulation cardiac hemodynamics risk factor patient CHF remain unclear . Pathological erythrocyte deformability aggregation reduces capillary perfusion oxygen transfer tissue , result tissue ischemia infraction . Shedding procoagulant-rich microparticles activate monocyte accelerate pathogenesis atherothrombosis . Bone marrow-derived , circulate endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) contribute maintenance endothelial function organ perfusion mechanism range endothelial repair angiogenesis . However , different effect AIT moderate continuous training ( MCT ) hemorheology , atherothrombosis angiogenesis modulate erythrocyte , monocyte EPC patient CHF investigate yet . Accordingly , conduct three-year study include 1st year study : effect AIT MCT hemorheology modulate erythrocyte patient CHF ; 2nd year : effect AIT MCT atherothrombosis modulate monocyte patient CHF ; 3rd year study : effect AIT MCT angiogenesis modulate EPC patient CHF clarify two exercise training affect cardiovascular hemorheological characteristic atherothrombosis/ angiogenesis-related variable patient chronic heart failure . We expect result obtain study aid determine appropriate exercise intervention improve aerobic fitness well simultaneously improve hemodynamic control minimize risk thrombogenesis patient CHF .</detailed_description>
