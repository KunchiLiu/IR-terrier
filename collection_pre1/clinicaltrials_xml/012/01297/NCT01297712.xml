	<brief_summary>Polyps find screen colonoscopy remove least biopsied . Attempts save cost include endoscopic assessment polyp regard differential diagnosis adenomas ( remove ) hyperplastic polyp ( could leave place remove examine histologically ) . Such concept would feasible endoscopy make differential diagnosis high accuracy . Such high accuracy rate - 80 % 95 % - report reference center specific scientific interest . The investigator want test whether result ) reproduce private practice set perform large-volume screening colonoscopy b ) whether late generation endoscope provide benefit term well accuracy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Assessment Polyp Histology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo screen colonoscopy randomize use two different colonoscope , namely late generation ( Pentax iScan , Hi Line ) versus previous generation ( Classic Line ) . On withdrawal , polyps find diagnose accord pit pattern ( classification scheme mit example image provide ) differential diagnosis make live examination . Pit pattern I/II classify hyperplastic polyp , pattern III-V adenoma ( subgroup IV V classify pre-/malignant ) . All polyp photograph near distance allow later blind review do patient one polyp ( avoid mix-up polyp ) 3 examiner 2 independent hospital expert .</detailed_description>
