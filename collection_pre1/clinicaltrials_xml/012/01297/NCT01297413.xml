	<brief_title>A Study Allogeneic Mesenchymal Bone Marrow Cells Subjects With Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke remain major global healthcare problem . Recent data compile American Heart Association ( AHA ) 2008 show annual incidence new recurrent stroke United States 780,000 , approximately 600,000 stroke first attack . Among adults age 20 old , estimate prevalence stroke 2005 5.8 million United States , result &gt; 150,000 death annually , 4.8 million stroke survivor alive today . Stroke rank country 's third lead cause death , behind cancer heart disease . The approved treatment acute ischemic stroke involve restore blood flow affect region use thrombolytic mechanical device physically remove clot . However , use thrombolytic limit due therapeutic window &lt; 3-6 hour post onset stroke symptom small fraction stroke patient receive therapy . Following completion stroke , little therapy offer patient promote recovery physical , occupational , speech therapy . Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell use number clinical trial different indication demonstrate safety allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell treatment . In addition ability differentiate multiple different cell type would contributory recovery repair brain replace destroyed cell , mesenchymal stem cell also secrete angiogenins , cytokine trophic factor support stimulate multiple cell type . The cascade cellular event follow release cytokine trophic factor would also potentially lead beneficial effect restore blood supply , rescue cell risk , stimulate remain cell population repair propagate new cell synaptic connection .</detailed_description>
