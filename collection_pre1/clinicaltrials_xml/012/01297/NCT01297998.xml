	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Adjuvant Chemotherapy With GC Biliary Tract Cancer Undergoing Resection Without Major Hepatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgery currently remain potentially curative treatment biliary tract cancer ( BTC ) , patient develop recurrence . Therefore , effective adjuvant chemotherapy require increase curability surgery prolong survival patient . However , date , standard adjuvant chemotherapy establish , guideline BTC treatment recommend trial adjuvant chemotherapy carry . Based result clinical study unresectable BTC , gemcitabine , platinum agent , fluoropyrimidine consider activity BTC . These agent expect effective postoperative adjuvant therapy BTC , Thus , randomize control trial gemcitabine ongoing , result expect . Recently , ABC-02 study , first prospective multicenter phase III study patient unresectable BTC , gemcitabine/cisplatin combination chemotherapy compare gemcitabine monotherapy show combination therapy significantly prolong MST ( 8.1 11.7 month ; P &lt; 0.001 ) . Gemcitabine/cisplatin combination therapy consider standard regimen unresectable BTC , expect regimen effective postoperative adjuvant therapy . Though hepatectomy frequently perform surgery BTC , unclear effect anticancer agent affect hepatectomy . Because gemcitabine metabolize cytidine deaminase primarily liver , consider decreased metabolic ability gemcitabine hepatectomy . Some clinical study demonstrate patient hepatectomy could tolerate standard dose schedule gemcitabine . In adjuvant chemotherapy gemcitabine , necessary examine separately whether hepatectomy undergone . In study , aim assess safety efficacy gemcitabine/cisplatin combination chemotherapy patient biliary tract cancer undergo curative resection without hepatectomy .</detailed_description>
