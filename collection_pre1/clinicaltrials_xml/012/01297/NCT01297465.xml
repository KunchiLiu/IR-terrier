	<brief_summary>This multicenter , multi-national , randomize , open-label comparative trial . After screen , subject start down-regulation treatment Day 21-22 cycle . Down-regulation treatment start within 2 month follow screen visit . The routine long luteal phase protocol gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist treatment follow . Once down-regulation confirmed , pregnancy test perform randomization start recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone ( r-hFSH ) treatment rule pre-existing pregnancy . If result negative , subject randomly assign one two treatment arm trial : - GONAL-f® : ( Liquid Pen ; 300 international unit [ IU ] per day ) stimulation Day 1-5 follow Pergoveris® ( vial/powder , 300 IU per day ) stimulation Day 6 require recombinant human chorionic hormone ( r-hCG ) criterion meet . The dose adjusted stimulation Day 6 ( increase decrease ) base upon subject 's ovarian response accord center 's standard practice . - Pergoveris® : ( vial/powder , 300 IU per day ) stimulation Day 1 require r-hCG criterion meet . The dose adjusted stimulation Day 6 ( increase decrease ) base upon subject 's ovarian response accord center 's standard practice . Randomization across two treatment arm keep balanced 1:1 ratio . Follicular development monitor accord center 's standard practice ultrasound ( US ) and/or estradiol ( E2 ) level , protocol r-hCG requirement meet ( i.e. , least one follicle great equal [ &gt; = ] 18 millimeter [ mm ] two follicle &gt; =16 mm ) . After , single injection r-hCG administer order induce final oocyte maturation . At time 34-38 hour r-hCG administration , oocytes recover vaginally US monitoring . Oocytes fertilized vitro embryo replace 2-5 day oocyte recovery . Ovum pick ( OPU ) , vitro fertilization ( IVF ) , embryo transfer ( ET ) luteal support perform per center 's standard practice . A post-treatment safety visit perform subject receive r-hCG ( pregnant non- pregnant ) Day 15-20 post-hCG . For subject withdraw treatment ( i.e . start Pergoveris® Gonal-f® hCG give ) visit take place 20-30 day first Pergoveris® Gonal-f® treatment injection ( exclude pregnancy test ) .</brief_summary>
