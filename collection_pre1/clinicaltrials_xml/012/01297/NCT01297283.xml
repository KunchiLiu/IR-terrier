	<detailed_description>The leadless electrocardiogram ( LECG ) new technology incorporate Consulta CRT-P obtain ECG signal Consulta CRT-P similar surface ECG obtain device programmer ( PECG ) external ECG machine . The LECG signal measure three electrode mount outside pacemaker housing provide electrical far field signal electrical activity heart . The LECG provide three ECG channel different projection electrical activity heart , similar surface ECG . Clinical interest LECG threefold . First , ECG record routinely use perform pacemaker cardiac resynchronization system in-office follow-up mainly determine pace threshold . Connection ECG electrodes patient well time need acquire acceptable ECG signal routine follow-up could save use LECG would make follow-up easy less time consume . Secondly , connect ECG electrode require patient present clinic follow-up . Use LECG conjunction transmit system allow remote patient follow-up . In case , correct ventricular capture confirmation LECG key importance . Finally , LECG store device memory time arrhythmia episode occurrence , help good classify . The following factor might influence quality LECG and/or axis LECG : - temporal change electrode tissue interface due device pocket heal process - change device position orientation time - body motion - poor LECG contact due oversized device pocket replacement procedure . The purpose study obtain data leadless ECG ( LECG ) determine whether LECG standard CRT follow-up indeed adequately replace surface ECG evaluate use remote follow-up evaluation .</detailed_description>
