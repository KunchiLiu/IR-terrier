	<detailed_description>Coughing distress symptom major impact quality life . It estimate cough cost UK economy £1 billion year . Currently effective anti-tussive agent treat subject cough . Although drug morphine may anti-tussive effect , side effect unacceptable . Currently understand mechanism lead cough different disease poor . Many mechanistic study rely test sensitivity cough reflex inhalation capsaicin ( chilli-pepper extract ) citric acid . These challenge differentiate well health disease different disease state . Other agent prostaglandins bradykinin know stimulate coughing responses agent rarely used measure cough reflex sensitivity compare standard challenge . It clear patient common airway disease COPD asthma cough significantly healthy subject . Moreover subject present chronic cough cough rate order magnitude high patient airway disease . These difference poorly represent difference current cough challenge test . The investigator hypothesize pattern cough response different tussive agent may better differentiate health different disease state . These pattern may also suggest different mechanism lead cough different disease .</detailed_description>

ACE inhibitor , codeine phosphate , morphine sulphate , 4 ) Patients severe respiratory disease i.e . FEV1 &lt; 1 litre , 5 ) Significant medical comorbidities likely affect ability participate trial affect cough reflex sensitivity e.g . diabetes , stroke , Parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis etc .</criteria>
