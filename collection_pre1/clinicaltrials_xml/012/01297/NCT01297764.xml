	<brief_summary>This study evaluate feasibility combine four active agent available treatment multiple myeloma . Further investigator attempt assess activity combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Carfilzomib , Lenalidomide , Vorinostat , Dexamethasone Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I/II study novel proteasome inhibitor , carfilzomib , show significant activity patient advance multiple myeloma , include patient bortezomib refractory disease . This drug , unlike bortezomib , minimal neurotoxicity appear minimal gastrointestinal ( GI ) toxicity . Experience combination bortezomib , lenalidomide dexamethasone show neuropathy chronic diarrhea limit . Vorinostat histone deacetylase inhibitor modest single agent activity multiple myeloma . Dysesthesia , GI issue fatigue problematic patient population . More recent study combine vorinostat lenalidomide dexamethasone bortezomib demonstrate much robust activity , include patient refractory lenalidomide bortezomib-based combination . Again , neuropathy , fatigue GI issue problematic . The investigator anecdotal experience combination proteasome inhibitor , histone deacetylase inhibitor , immunomodulators dexamethasone show combination extremely active well tolerate . The combination vorinostat , carfilzomib , lenalidomide dexamethasone offer opportunity maximize activity limit toxicity , particularly neuropathy GI .</detailed_description>
