	<brief_summary>This investigation design study brain function perform explicit memory task , furthermore brain system support performance test change function age . Implicit memory task may distinguish explicit memory test explicit memory characterizes direct intentional recollection previously learn information event . In contrast , implicit ( nonconscious ) memory express facilitation performance task judgment stimulus owe prior presentation stimulus , without necessary conscious awareness prior presentation . The investigator propose use functional Magnetic resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) measure brain activity performance carefully design explicit memory task . Comparison brain activity different test condition provide information brain area involve mediate specific aspect performance . Both old young individual test order understand age relate change brain activity . In order examine interaction participant ' differential level amyloid burden performance cognitive task fMRI neural activation , investigator also propose PET image old participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The basic approach measure brain activity associate give cognitive process ( process ) follow : It know increase brain neuronal activity associate local increase energy metabolism . Under normal circumstance , increase brain metabolism lead local change blood oxygenation venule large vein . This change blood oxygenation detect image method sensitive difference magnetic state oxygenate deoxygenated hemoglobin . The ultimate benefit research well understand change performance brain organization underlie performance affect age .</detailed_description>
