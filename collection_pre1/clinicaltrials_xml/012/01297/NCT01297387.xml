	<brief_summary>This observational prospective study evaluate , accord usual local clinical practice , feasibility endoluminal revascularization diabetic patient type C D lesion , accord TASC II Criteria . About 300 patient treat usual revascularization procedure . Each patient follow least 12 month evaluate clinical outcome limb salvage intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Peripheral Angioplasty Type D TASCII Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2000 , Trans Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus ( TASC ) state patient CLI treat revascularization , provide sufficient blood flow relieve rest pain heal skin lesion . TASC also suggest best procedure avoid general anaesthesia , pose less systemic stress fewer serious complication . All consideration pose peripheral angioplasty ( PTA ) procedure choice , feasible . Unfortunately , TASC Recommendations , publish 2000 confirmed 2007 , use morphological criterion define guideline choice revascularization procedure . According recommendation , type C D lesion , comprise serious stenosis occlusion , affect long tract vessel , candidate bypass intervention , PTA . This choice due first impression , deny BASIL study , PTA could affect reduce efficacy limb salvage . Diabetic Patients characterize high prevalence long occlusion crural artery anatomical asset reduces , accord TASC II criterion , feasibility Bypass Graft ( BPG ) large number patient . Our preliminary experience show feasibility PTA diabetic patient Chronic Critical Limb Ischemia ( CLI ) , high percentage efficient revascularization , regardless morphology number obstruction . This study aim evaluate outcome PTA procedure also patient lesion 20 cm longer superficial femoral artery `` long lesion '' subpopliteal artery . All diabetic patient refer Diabetic Foot Centre either foot lesion rest pain assess presence Critical Limb Ischemia ( CLI ) accord TASC II Criteria . These patient , accord usual local clinical practice , undergo angiographic evaluation , feasible , peripheral angioplasty . The peripheral pulse evaluate palpation auscultation continuous-wave Doppler technique , ankle-pressure record , assessable ( foot artery absent compressible medial calcification ) , transcutaneous oxygen tension ( TcPO2 ) evaluate dorsum foot duplex scanning perform . In patient one reduce absent foot pulse , TcPO2 &lt; 50 mmHg , ankle-pressure &lt; 70 mmHg , significant obstruction present duplex scanning , arteriography carry . In patient obstruction &gt; 50 % vessel diameter , PTA first-choice revascularization procedure perform session angiographic study . In patient PTA feasible , by-pass operation consider . The patient PTA BPG possible , receive therapy prostanoids lumbar sympathectomy plus prostanoids , possible . In patient therapy relieve rest pain gangrene extend Chopart joint , above-the-ankle-amputation propose perform . PTA procedure PTA consider indicate angiographically document obstruction great 50 % vessel lumen . The procedure perform local anesthesia antegrade puncture ipsilateral common femoral artery . If obstruction present iliac trunk duplex scanning , puncture perform contralateral approach . Vessel recanalization consider successful direct flow obtain treated vessel , residual stenosis &gt; 50 % vessel diameter along artery . BPG procedure The choice proximal distal BPG anastomosis depend angiographic picture aim obtain least one patent foot artery . The inflow optimize , possible , combine femoral-popliteal bypass PTA iliac trunk . Moreover , also view follow distal angioplasty , distal anastomosis perform suitable popliteal tibial artery segment use intraluminal clamp microsurgical technique . The surgery always carry epidural anesthesia . The autogenous saphena vein employ present good condition . If venous conduit could use , alloplastic prosthetic material ( polytetrafluoroethylene : PTFE ) employ peripheral below-the-knee anastomosis consist venous cuff use Miller 's technique , `` composite '' bypass interposition distal venous segment . The absence available saphena angiographic score run &gt; 7 Rutherford scale exclude patient , otherwise could eligible major amputation , revascularization distal bypass . Treatment non revascularized patient Prostanoids ( alprostadil-α-cyclodextrine 60-120 μgr/day ) infuse intravenously average 5 day hospital discharge . When possible accepted patient , lumbar sympathectomy perform . In patient pain change record TcPO2 ankle-pressure value reassess 5 day PTA , BPG , lumbar sympathectomy medical therapy . Limb salvage In patient complain rest pain without foot ulcer , disappearance pain consider successful limb salvage . In patient foot ulcer consider limb salvage successful ulcer heal plantar stand maintain , even achieve tarsal-metatarsal amputation patient able walk without crutch artificial leg . Conversely , above-the-ankle amputation consider failure . Limb salvage consider early pain disappear ulcer heal 30 day hospital admission . Follow-up After hospital discharge All patient foot ulcer examined weekly ulcer heal . All patient provide extra-deep rocker shoe soft thermoformable leather customize insole . Evidence PTA restenosis assess clinically , base pain reappearance ulcer recurrence . In situation ankle-pressure TcPO2 reassess duplex scanning perform ( 22 ) . If ankle pressure TcPO2 significantly bad ( &lt; 15 % post-PTA value ) Duplex scan positive , patient underwent repeat angiographic evaluation PTA , possible . Morphological restenosis investigate : absence rest pain ulcer reappearance perform revascularization ( 23 ) , therefore consider morphological restenosis clinically irrelevant . BPG treat patient follow vascular surgery protocol ( 24 ) . The graft patency assess clinical examination ultrasound study 30 day , 3,6,12 month thereafter every 6 month . Pulse systolic velocity anastomosis morphology assess ultrasound study . Finally , inflow compare pre-operative condition . For every invasive treatment ( PTA , BPG , sympathectomy , surgical operation foot ) write informed consent form propose obtain patient .</detailed_description>
