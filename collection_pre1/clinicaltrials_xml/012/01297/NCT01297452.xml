	<criteria>Pathologically confirm recurrent metastatic advance solid tumor , curativeintent treatment option . Pathology confirmation must perform MSKCC . Age ≥ 18 year ECOG performance status ≤ 1 Life expectancy ≥ 12 week Adequate bone marrow function show : ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L , Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L , Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL Total calcium ( correct serum albumin ) within normal limit ( biphosphonate use malignant hypercalcemia control allow ) Magnesium ≥ low limit normal Adequate liver function . Serum bilirubin must within upper limit normal . ( ULN ) . AST ALT Alkaline Phosphatase must within range allow eligibility . In determine eligibility abnormal two value ( AST ALT ) use . Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN 24hour clearance ≥ 55 mL/min Fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) ≤120 mg/dL ≤6.7 mmol/L HbA1c ≤ 8 % Negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day start study treatment woman childbearing potential Ability swallow oral medication EXPANSION COHORT B ONLY : Documented genetic alteration ( mutation homozygous deletion ) PTEN gene , identify MSKCC IMPACT assay platform CLIAapproved test . Patients receive prior treatment P13K inhibitor . Patients know hypersensitivity BKM120 excipients Patients untreated brain metastasis exclude . However , patient metastatic CNS tumor may participate trial , patient &gt; 4 week therapy completion ( incl . radiation and/or surgery ) , clinically stable time study entry receive corticosteroid therapy Patients acute chronic liver , renal disease pancreatitis Patients follow mood disorder judge Investigator psychiatrist , result patient 's mood assessment questionnaire : medically document history active major depressive episode , bipolar disorder ( I II ) , obsessivecompulsive disorder , schizophrenia , history suicidal attempt ideation , homicidal ideation ( immediate risk harm others ) *≥ CTCAE grade 3 anxiety At screening , mood rating score ≥ 10 PHQ9 and/or ≥ 15 GAD7 , unless overrule psychiatrist 's assessment Patient select response `` 1 , 2 , 3 '' question 9 PHQ9 questionnaire regard potential suicidal thought ideation ( independent total score PHQ9 ) Note : The psychiatric judgment overrules mood assessment questionnaire result/investigators judgment . If mood rating score meet eligibility criterion and/or investigator deems patient mood disorder render patient ineligible , patient may register study unless subsequent psychiatric clinic consultation psychiatrist overrules mood assessment questionnaire result/investigator judgment . Patients diarrhea ≥ CTCAE grade 2 Any follow concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition could compromise participation study : ST depression elevation ≥ 1.5 mm 2 lead Congenital long QT syndrome History presence sustain ventricular arrhythmia atrial fibrillation Clinically significant rest bradycardia ( &lt; 50 beat per minute ) QTc &gt; 480 msec screen ECG Complete leave bundle branch block Right bundle branch block + leave anterior hemiblock ( bifascicular block ) Unstable angina pectoris ≤ 6 month prior start study drug Acute myocardial infarction ≤ 6 month prior start study drug Other clinically significant heart disease congestive heart failure require treatment ( NYHA Class III IV ) uncontrolled hypertension ( please refer WHOISH guideline ) Patients uncontrolled diabetes mellitus Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical condition ( e.g. , active uncontrolled infection ) could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption BKM120 ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) . Patients unresolved diarrhea exclude previously indicate Patients treat hematopoietic colonystimulating growth factor ( e.g. , GCSF , GMCSF ) ≤ 2 week prior start study drug . Erythropoietin darbepoetin therapy , initiate least 2 week prior enrollment , may continue Patients currently receive treatment QT prolong medication know risk induce Torsades de Pointes treatment either discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug . Please refer Appendix E list prohibit drug . Patient currently treat drug know moderate strong inhibitor inducer isoenzyme CYP3A , treatment discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug . Please refer Appendix B list prohibit CYP 3A4 inhibitor inducer . Patients receive systemic corticosteroid ≤ 2 week prior start study drug . Systemic corticosteroid administer BKM120 ( Usage steroid premedications antiemetic paclitaxel carboplatin , per MSKCC guideline , allow ) . Steroids give part premedications image study exclusionary. ) . Patients receive chemotherapy target anticancer therapy ≤ 4 week ( 6 week nitrosourea , antibody mitomycinC ) prior start study drug recover side effect therapy ( except alopecia ) Patients receive continuous intermittent small molecule therapeutic ( exclude monoclonal antibody ) ≤ 5 effective half live prior start study drug recover side effect therapy ( except alopecia ) Patients receive radiotherapy within ≤ 4 week prior registration Patients undergone major surgery ≤ 2 week prior start study drug recover side effect therapy Patients currently take therapeutic dos warfarin sodium coumadinderivative anticoagulant . Patient currently treat olanzapine and/or drug know moderate strong inhibitor inducer isoenzyme CYP3A , treatment discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug . Women pregnant breast feeding adult reproductive potential employ effective method birth control . Double barrier contraceptive must use trial sex . Oral , implantable , injectable contraceptive may affect cytochrome P450 interaction , therefore consider effective study . Known diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection History another malignancy within 3 year , except cure basal cell carcinoma skin excise carcinoma situ cervix Patient unable unwilling abide study protocol cooperate fully investigator More 2 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens recurrent metastatic disease Patients multifocal peripheral sensory alteration paresthesias ( include tingle ) interfere function , per patient report ( example : activity daily live ) . Patients receive investigational therapy Patients receive herbal preparations/medications Patients prior history whole pelvic radiation therapy ( WPRT ) EXPANSION COHORT A ONLY : More one prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen ( set recurrent and/or metastatic disease ( cytotoxic chemotherapy give part neoadjuvant therapy , adjuvant therapy , concurrent chemoradiation curative intent include exclusion item ) .
