	<criteria>Cancer Patients Patient Fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) /Computer tomography ( CT ) perform 14 day prior treatment BAY869596 detection , stag , restaging , therapy response assessment still show tumor mass high certainty , cancer Colorectal cancer , Breast cancer ( female patient ) , Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cancer colorectal cancer hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) histologically confirm ( Exception , base diagnostic criterion management hepatocellular carcinoma : Histological diagnosis hepatocelluar carcinoma necessary nodule large 2 cm , visualize two dynamic image study show arterial hyperenhancement wash venous phase . ) Patient prostate cancer ( primary recurrent ) , still show tumor mass ( primary tumor and/or lymph node metastasis and/or distant metastasis ) primary cancer disease histologically confirm Patient brain metastasis ( strong evidence image modality ) , primary cancer disease histologically confirm . Patient primary malignant brain tumor either confirm histology , positive cytology cerebrospinal fluid , image modality ( MRI , CT ) strongly support diagnosis brain tumor . Patient cancer ( ovarian cancer , melanoma ) , preferably FDG PET/CT available , primary cancer histologically confirm . Inflammation Patients Patient inflammatory disease inflammatory focus/foci . An FDG PET/CT inflammation available . Patient underwent FDG PET/CT inflammation . The maximum interval FDG PET/CT examination BAY869596 5 day , performance examination two subsequent day recommend . Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable medical disease cancer inflammation ( e.g . poorly control diabetes , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 12 month prior plan injection BAY869596 , unstable uncontrolled hypertension , severe pulmonary disease , chronic renal hepatic disease could compromise participation study . When consider hepatic function hepatocellular cancer patient , ChildPugh score apply , score &gt; 7 consider exclusion criterion . Known sensitivity study drug component preparation Drug abuse/dependence history recover alcohol dependence . Patient complete participation another clinical study involve administration investigational drug precede 4 week participate clinical trial study Previous participation treatment phase study Unwillingness inability comply protocol Patient fulfils criterion opinion investigator preclude participation scientific reason , reason compliance , reason patient 's safety . Patients inflammatory disease know tumor image tumor lesion may overlap inflammatory lesion , tumor patient know inflammatory disease ( e.g . autoimmune disease ) , image inflammatory lesion may overlap tumor lesion .</criteria>
