	<brief_title>A Biomarker Study Tivozanib Subjects With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , open-label , single arm , multi-center , study orally administer tivozanib approximately 100 subject advance renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . This study design evaluate biomarkers blood archive tissue sample , correlation clinical activity and/or treatment-related toxicity subject advance RCC , estimate percentage tivozanib-treated subject progression-free 6 month , overall response rate ( ORR ) , progression free survival ( PFS ) , safety tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) . Subjects stratify histology ( clear cell vs. non-clear cell ) . Enrollment non-clear cell subject limit ≤ 30 % entire study population . Study enrollment anticipate complete approximately 9 month . Treatment duration estimate last approximately 6 month subject 's first dose tivozanib follow-up period 30 day . After 6 month , treatment tivozanib may continue participation rollover protocol ( AV-951-09-901 ) . Maximum duration subject participation Phase 2 study approximately 8 month .</detailed_description>
