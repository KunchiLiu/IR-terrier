	<brief_summary>Recent development continuous glucose sensor insulin infusion pump motivate research toward closed-loop strategy regulate glucose level patient type 1 diabetes . In closed-loop strategy , pump ( ) infusion rate alter base computer-generated recommendation relies continuous glucose sensor reading . In study , aim compare effectiveness dual-hormone ( insulin+glucagon ) closed-loop strategy open-loop conventional continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump ( CSII ) therapy regulate glucose level even exercise night follow exercise adult type 1 diabetes .</brief_summary>
