	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Evaluation PNEUMOSTEM® Treatment Premature Infants With Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) common cause death child bear prematurely , low birth weight . In addition , many child recover disease suffer many side effect prolong hospitalization , pulmonary hypertension , failure thrive . The purpose BPD treatment make baby able spontaneous breathe spontaneous breathe baby need much energy baby may difficulty feed . For reason , medication steroid , diuretic respiratory drug currently use . However , effective cure far . It report bone marrow derive mesenchymal stem cell ( BM-MSC ) differentiate pulmonary epithelial pulmonary endothelial cell . Some animal study show BM-MSC differentiate bronchial cell type 2 pneumocytes rat pneumonia improve fibrosis occur administration bleomycin . Based finding , consider mesenchymal stem cell therapy help regenerate damage lung well BPD cause lung inflammation , fibrosis , deficiency type 2 pneumocytes , . PNEUMOSTEM® human umbilical cord blood derive mesenchymal stem cell intend treat premature infant BPD . The main purpose study evaluate safety tolerability study drug establish maximum toxicity dose . The latent efficacy also assess .</detailed_description>
