	<detailed_description>Depression common mental disorder present depress mood , loss interest , feeling guilt low self-worth , disturbed sleep appetite , low energy , poor concentration . These problem become chronic recurrent lead substantial impairment individual 's ability take care everyday responsibility , bad , depression lead suicide.Depression reliably diagnose primary care . Antidepressant medication brief , structure form psychotherapy effective 60-80 % affect delivered primary care . In patient depression cerebral metabolism derange specific area hypoexcitability frontal cortical area . High-frequency rTMS dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) investigate treatment hypoexcitability disorder . Pilot data indicate mild effect rTMS could increase special kind TMS , Theta-burst stimulation .
