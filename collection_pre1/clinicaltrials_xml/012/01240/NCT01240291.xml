	<brief_title>The Clinical Role Intravenous Glutamine Trauma Patients Receiving Enteral Nutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trauma Patients characterize alteration immune response , increased exposure infectious complication , sepsis , consequently organ failure death . Glutamine supplementation parenteral nutrition one nutritional intervention proven associate improved survival rate , decrease infectious morbidity , cost , intensive care unit , hospital length stay . However , glutamine supplementation patient receive enteral nutrition best route still controversial . A number trial investigate beneficial effect intravenous alanyl-glutamine supplementation critically ill patient receive enteral nutrition . However , trial : pilot trial , investigated surrogate outcome , supplementation short period time . Therefore , well design trial need investigate effect intravenous alanyl-glutamine supplementation critically ill patient multiple trauma receive enteral nutrition major clinical outcome . Our hypothesis trauma patient receive standard enteral nutrition supplement intravenous alanyl-glutamine demonstrate improve clinical outcome compare patient receive standard enteral nutrition without supplementation .</detailed_description>
