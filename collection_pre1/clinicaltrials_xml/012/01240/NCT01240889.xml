	<brief_title>Effects Intranasal Corticosteroid Montelukast On Nasal Allergen Challenges*</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal proposal assess ability intranasal corticosteroid , fluticasone , montelukast affect upper airway systemic physiologic , biologic clinical parameter occur early late upper airway allergic response ragweed ragweed allergic rhiniticsThe assessment early allergy response nose fairly well establish laboratory use method detail previous publication ( 21 , 23 24 ) . One potential challenge sample upper airway mediator cytokine without affect clinical parameter symptom score acoustic rhinometry reading . Moreover , need sample time point throughout six hour order accurately determine effect late phase allergic response . Nasal filter paper sample technique currently engage use , work Roche elute sample measure multiple mediator cytokine .</detailed_description>
