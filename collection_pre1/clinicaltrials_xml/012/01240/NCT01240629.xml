	<brief_summary>This research study advance prostate cancer . An experimental drug call AN-152 ( also know AEZS-108 ) use . The purpose study test safety , tolerability benefit experimental drug call AN-152 . The participant tumor test expression receptor ( use old biopsy ) . If participant cancer receptor , participant eligible participant study . AN-152 ( AEZS-108 ) administer intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour give specify dose every 3 week . Premedication dexamethasone 8mg recommend . Participants continue treatment death , disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , participant refusal , treatment delay &gt; 3 week , completion 6 cycle . Continuation beyond 6 cycle leave discretion study doctor . The study plan last 2 year . Up 55 ( 18 Phase I portion , 37 Phase II portion ) .</brief_summary>
