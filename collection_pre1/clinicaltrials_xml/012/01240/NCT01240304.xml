	<detailed_description>The purpose phase II clinical trial study assess resection rate among subject initially diagnose unresectable borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma . This do provide preoperative treatment include alternate cycle chemotherapy radiotherapy treatment . In addition , clinical trial ass safety preoperative chemotherapy radiation therapy subject unresectable borderline resectable adenocarcinoma pancreatic head , assess margin-negative resection rate , disease-free survival , assess overall survival rate , determine pattern local distant recurrence . The study population clinical trial consist untreated subject 18 year old histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis unresectable borderline resectable adenocarcinoma pancreatic head . Once patient undergone necessary test tumor stag , principal investigator co-investigators determine patient suitable inducted clinical trial . The course preoperative treatment study consist alternate combination 6mg/M² Gemzar 24 hour 7.0 Gy radiation therapy . The subject undergo one therapy alternate daily total 10 day subject allow rest 4 week undergo restaging surgery . After surgery , subject undergo conventional chemotherapy regimen consist 6 cycle 1000mg/M² Gemzar 30 minute infusion rate . The primary outcome clinical trial margin-negative resection rate . This determine tumor 's response pre/post-operative treatment tumor remove surgically via pancreaticoduodenectomy . Once subject complete treatment describe protocol , he/she continue followed assess survival pattern local distance recurrence . The purpose clinical trial attempt provide subject hopeful alternative treatment disease otherwise offer grim prognosis .</detailed_description>
