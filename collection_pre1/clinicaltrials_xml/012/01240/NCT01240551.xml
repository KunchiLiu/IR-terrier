	<brief_summary>Background : - Sodium fluoride ( NaF ) common compound find various food use increase bone strength . When compound add small dose radiation ( F-18 ) , collect bone , high amount area bone rapidly change , site healing fracture tumor . By give F-18 NaF combine positron emission tomography/ compute tomography ( PET/CT ) scan , researcher hope able good measure change bone may indicate certain type cancer ( prostate cancer ) spread bone . Objectives : - To evaluate effectiveness F-18 NaF image study measure bone tumor change time compare clinical course , individual prostate cancer . - To determine small amount change bone tumor F-18 NaF accurately measure . Eligibility : - Men least 18 year age diagnose prostate cancer image study determine whether cancer spread bone . Both patient without know bone involvement enrol . Design : - Participants screen physical examination , medical history , image study , provide baseline blood sample evaluate kidney function . - For study , participant two F-18 NaF PET/CT scan separate day baseline . These repeat scan use determine amount change due image process alone ( i.e . due disease get good worse . Participants receive dose F-18 NaF intravenously , PET/CT scan body ( mid ear upper thigh ) 1 hour , body follow complete whole-body PET/CT scan approximately 2 hour F-18 NaF injection . Participants watch closely side effect F-18 NaF scan do , ask drink plenty water void F-18 NaF body scan . - As followup study , participant two F-18 NaF PET/CT scan , one 4 8 month first scan one 10 14 month first scan . Participants provide additional blood sample followup scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Evaluating response therapy prostate cancer limit inability quantify bony metastatic disease - F-18 sodium fluoride ( NaF ) PET radiopharmaceutical localizes region bony turnover , 1st bone scan agent ( prior Tc-99m MDP ( methylene diphosphonate ) availability ) - Today high sensitivity PET camera image distribution F-18 NaF whole body volume permit quantification uptake time . The addition co-registered CT increase diagnostic accuracy detection metastatic disease Primary Objective : -To evaluate feasibility use NaF PET/CT quantitatively measure extent bony metastatic disease patient prostate cancer patient - To determine intra-patient reproducibility F-18 NaF PET/CT - To explore relationship biodistribution change F-18 NaF PET/CT parameter clinical response Eligibility : - Participant must pathology proven adenocarcinoma prostate . - Participant must - A history PSA &gt; 10ng/mL history PSA double time le equal 6 month , know bone metastatic involvement standard care image ( Tc-99m MDP bone scan , CT etc ) . OR -- Any PSA ( prostate specific antigen ) level know bone metastatic disease standard care image ( Tc-99m MDP bone scan , CT etc . ) - Participant must 18 year old ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) Performance grade 0 2 - Ability provide inform consent . All subject must sign document inform consent indicate understanding investigational nature risk study protocol relate study perform . Design : This pilot , 2-arm , open label study patient prostate cancer . One arm accrue patient know bone metastasis second accrue patient risk develop bone metastasis ( 30 patient per group ; total enrollment 60 patient ) . As possible different rate bone lesion detection dependent hormone responsiveness tumor , stratification ( castrate sensitive vs. castrate resistant tumor ) may perform evaluate predominant trend . All participant undergo static F-18 NaF image session baseline , 4-8 month , 10-14 month follow enrollment ( 3 session 1-year ) . Half participant ( 15 group ) undergo two baseline F-18 NaF PET/CT image session ( within 14-days ) order evaluate reproducibility F-18 NaF PET image total 4 session 1-year period . The change bone uptake F-18 NaF measure , reproducibility determine , preliminary comparison clinical response make .</detailed_description>
