	<brief_summary>The aim Study Protocol provide basis clinical development 131I-F16SIP anti-cancer therapeutic agent . The study follow greatly motivated promising result Phase I/II study similar investigational drug develop Company , 131I-L19SIP , several Italian center .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Dose Finding Efficacy Study Tumour Targeting Human 131I-F16SIP Monoclonal Antibody Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The F16SIP antibody fully human antibody , capable preferential localization around tumour blood vessel spar normal tissue . The formation new blood vessel rare event adult ( exception make female reproductive cycle ) , pathological feature aggressive type cancer . The study aim determine therapeutic potential F16 antibody SIP format , label radionuclide 131I , treatment patient different cancer type .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Phase I : Patients cancer , progressive disease prestudy period , refractory conventional standard treatment . Solid Tumor : Histologically/cytologically confirm diagnosis cancer , preferably lung cancer , prostate cancer colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . At least one measurable ( minimum 2.0 cm ) , non irradiated lesion define accord modify RECIST criterion i.e . whenever measurable disease restrict solitary lesion , neoplastic nature need confirm cytology/histology . Lymphoproliferative Diseases : Histologically/cytologically confirm diagnosis lymphoproliferative disease . At least one measurable ( minimum 2.0 cm ) non irradiate lesion define accord modify RECIST criterion , i.e . whenever measurable disease restrict solitary lesion ; neoplastic nature need confirmed cytology/histology . Phase II : Patients lymphoma , breast cancer lung cancer progressive disease prestudy period , refractory conventional standard treatment , enrol study . Presence brain metastasis time screen represent exclusion criterion .
