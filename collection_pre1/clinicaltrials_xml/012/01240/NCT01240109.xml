	<brief_title>Effect Remifentanil Cough During Emergence From General Anesthesia : Trial Compare Between Sevoflurane Anesthesia Propofol Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During recovery general anesthesia stimulus endotracheal tube lead coughing , hypertension , tachycardia , cause serious complication . It demonstrate opioid , intravenous topical lidocaine administration attenuate cough reflex . Administered opioid emergence , effective prevent cough reflex recovery delay , difficult predict emergence . However , remifentanil opioid widely use rapid context-sensitive half-life , target-controled infusion method adequately maintain effect site concentration could help predict recovery time alert state general anesthesia . It consider proper method continuous infusion remifentanil reduce emergence cough . Recent reporter suggest antitussive effect remifentanil differs depend main anesthetic agent , incidence cough tracheal extubation reduce propofol anesthesia compare sevoflurane anesthesia . However , study raise important question failure maintain effect site concentration remifentanil group . The objective study compare effect remifentanil suppression cough reflex emergence patient anesthetize use either propofol sevoflurane additionally infusion identical concentration remifentanil .
