	<brief_summary>MultiStem ( r ) new biological product , manufacture human stem cell obtain adult bone marrow nonembryonic tissue source . Factors express MultiStem cell believe reduce inflammation regulate immune system function , protect damage injured cell tissue , promote formation new blood vessel , augment tissue repair heal . MultiStem cell treatment result significant efficacy mouse model Graft versus Host Disease almost complete reversal gastrointestinal pathology ( similar pathology would expect Ulcerative Colitis ) . These data , together safety data generate 2 clinical trial , suggest MultiStem potential new treatment option patient ulcerative colitis . This first study MultiStem patient population cautiously explore safety/toleration potential benefit new treatment patient moderate severe disease .</brief_summary>
