	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose viral therapy treat young patient solid tumor come back responded standard therapy . Some tumor cell genetic weakness make unable fight virus call wild-type reovirus . The virus cause cell weakness die , may therefore able kill tumor cell without damage normal cell . Cyclophosphamide drug use chemotherapy stop tumor cell divide cause die . Giving wild-type reovirus together cyclophosphamide may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) REOLYSIN ( wild-type reovirus ) administer intravenous infusion daily 5 day , every 28 day child relapse refractory solid tumor . II . To define describe toxicity Reolysin patient . III . To define toxicity tolerability combine Reolysin oral cyclophosphamide patient . IV . To characterize pharmacokinetics ( time course viral clearance ) Reolysin child refractory cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define antitumor activity Reolysin within confines phase I study . II . To evaluate development neutralize antibody Reolysin follow intravenous administration Reolysin alone combination cyclophosphamide . III . To assess biologic activity Reolysin . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study wild-type reovirus . Patients receive wild-type reovirus intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute daily ( QD ) day 1-5 . Some patient also receive cyclophosphamide orally ( PO ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 1 year .</detailed_description>
