	<brief_summary>Increased mammographic density recognize important risk factor develop breast cancer , however , underlie mechanism explain relationship unclear . The investigator hypothesize Molecular Breast Imaging ( MBI ) accurately distinguish dense tissue mammography high risk dense tissue low risk indicate cellular activity dense tissue radiotracer uptake ( functional density ) breast . In pilot study , investigator want compare histological characteristic breast tissue patient similar density mammography different level functional density MBI .</brief_summary>
