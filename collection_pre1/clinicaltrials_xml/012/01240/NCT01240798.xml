	<brief_summary>People report feel sad low ( depression ) worry ( anxiety ) appear likely subsequently suffer heart attack , angina . However know whether depression anxiety actually cause heart disease . If mental health problem heart disease cause effect important implication world health . Previous research topic several limitation . First , study study heart disease one thing . There need study distinguish different type heart disease ( e.g . different type heart attack , angina ) may link mental health problem different way . Second , clear whether symptoms heart disease come depression anxiety way round ? Much available research look detail rely data occasional snapshot study population rather continuous record . The investigator propose use linkage national registry coronary event general practice record GPRD , allow u address limitation . The investigator research help u understand well whether mental health problem cause onset different type coronary disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Depression Anxiety Aetiology Prognosis Specific Cardiovascular Disease Syndromes : CALIBER Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study part CALIBER ( Cardiovascular disease research use link bespoke study electronic record ) programme fund 5 year NIHR Wellcome Trust . The central theme CALIBER research linkage Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project ( MINAP ) primary care ( GPRD ) resource . The overarch aim CALIBER good understand aetiology prognosis specific coronary phenotype across range causal domain , particularly electronic record provide contribution beyond traditional study . CALIBER receive Ethics approval ( ref 09/H0810/16 ) ECC approval ( ref ECC 2-06 ( b ) /2009 CALIBER dataset ) . Overall aim To elucidate role depression anxiety aetiology prognosis specific acute chronic coronary disease phenotype . Background Coronary disease depression major cause mortality morbidity globally public health impact causal association two profound1 . But meta-analysis 22 aetiologic cohort study ( 4016 event ) presence depression associate 70 % increase risk CHD event . This systematic review , others , identify several limitation exist research , include ) clinical phenotype resolution : broad aggregate CHD , rather specific coronary phenotype , b ) small size , insufficient event number compare risk woman men , c ) temporal resolution : Single time point exposure depression ( usually prevalent ) ; unclear temporal relation onset symptom depression onset symptom associate coronary disease lack study assess whether exposure depression prior onset symptomatic coronary disease influence prognosis ( future progression ) coronary disease establish , ) incomplete inconsistent assessment potential confounders mediator : unclear role social deprivation , smoking , alcohol behaviour may confound association ; unclear role detection , treatment control cardiovascular risk among patient depression lack consideration co-existing psychiatric morbidity . Study design Observational study , use cohort case series analyse initially healthy population , among patient specific manifestation coronary disease . Sample size calculation We ample statistical power main hypothesis . For example estimate relative risk effect depression ( v ) STEMI , compare relative risk effect depression v non-STEMI . Assuming depression exposure prevalence 10 % , 500 link case type alpha 0.01 , able distinguish relative risk , say 1.7 . Data analysis Our overall analytic approach involve distinction different coronary disease phenotype form endpoint aetiologic , start-points prognostic , analyse different temporal pattern evolution risk . Furthermore consider separate , joint , effect depression anxiety , distinguish solitary measure cumulative impact serial measure , specific coronary disease phenotype . A structured Statistical Analytic Protocol detail analyse data extent analytic choice pre-specified , make available request . Expected value result This provide opportunity investigate large scale association depression specific coronary syndrome come linkage GPRD MINAP .</detailed_description>
