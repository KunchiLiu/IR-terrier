Measurable disease presentation disease measurable Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) require phase II cohort . A life expectance least 3 month evidence Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . Age great equal 18 year Last dose chemotherapy experimental therapy 4 week ( 6 week case nitrosourea ) prior enrollment date ; unless last therapy consist oral agent whose average half life know less 48 hour case 2 week need elapse .
