	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate prototype quadrivalent influenza vaccine ( QIV ) , license 2010-2011 trivalent influenza vaccine ( TIV ) contain primary B strain ( B1 ) , investigational TIV contain alternate B ( B2 ) strain child . Primary Objective : To demonstrate non-inferiority antibody responses QIV compare license 2010-2011 TIV ( contain primary B strain ) investigational TIV ( contain alternate B strain ) assess geometric mean titer ( GMT ) ratios four virus strain separately among child age 6 month le 9 year age Secondary Objective : To demonstrate superiority antibody responses B strain QIV compare antibody titer follow vaccination TIV contain correspond B strain , assess GMT ratio seroconversion rate . Observational Objective : To describe safety profile QIV among subject 6 month le 9 year age , assess solicit injection site systemic adverse event ( AEs ) collect 7 day post-vaccination , unsolicited adverse event collect 21 day post-vaccination , adverse event special interest serious adverse event ( SAEs ) collect Visit 1 Visit 2 .</brief_summary>
