	<brief_summary>Background : - The experimental drug IPdR break body IdUrd , give patient find improve radiation therapy . IdUrd give vein ; therefore new drug ( IPdR ) make take mouth . Researchers interested determine whether IPdR also study find improve radiation therapy . The current study find people absorb drug give mouth . Objectives : - To evaluate level drug breakdown product blood follow single dose IPdR mouth . . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose cancer ( solid tumor lymphomas ) respond standard treatment . Design : - This study involve initial dose visit , one day admission hospital blood work , follow-up visit 14 day later . - Participants screen physical examination medical history , well blood urine sample . - Participants receive single dose IPdR , provide multiple blood urine sample 24 hour administration drug . - Fourteen day receive IPdR , participants another physical examination additional blood urine test evaluate IPdR broken body . - Cancer treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - The nucleoside analog iododeoxyuridine ( IdUrd , NSC 39661 ) show promising activity radiosensitizer preclinical model evaluate Phase I/II clinical trial . The extent radiosensitization directly relate incorporation IdUrd tumor DNA replacement thymidine . - IPdR ( NSC 726188 ) orally administer prodrug IdUrd well therapeutic index preclinical model . - This first human study IPdR evaluate whether IPdR absorb plasma level IPdR major metabolite , IdUrd , achieve single oral dose . Objectives : - Measure plasma concentration IPdR , IdUrd , IdUrd metabolites single oral dose IPdR - Determine safety administer single oral dose IPdR . Eligibility : -Patients must great equal 18 year age histologically confirm solid tumor lymphoid malignancy refractory least one line standard treatment standard therapy available . Patients adequate organ function disease-associated symptom require immediate therapy intervention . Study Design : - Patients receive single oral dose IPdR day 1 . - The initial IPdR dose 150 mg ; dose escalation 100 % increment maximum 2400 mg. One patient accrue dose level reach high dose level . Six patient accrue dose level 5 ( 2400 mg ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically document ( confirmed Laboratory Pathology , NCI ) solid tumor lymphoid malignancy refractory least one line standard treatment standard therapy available . Patients lymphoid malignancy may enrol disease standard therapy currently indicate . Patients diseaseassociated symptom require immediate therapy intervention . Any prior chemotherapy radiation therapy must complete great equal 2 week prior enrollment ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) , patient must recover eligibility level prior toxicity . Age great equal 18 year . Patients 18 year age exclude inability protect population give appropriate consent nontherapeutic study . ECOG performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 60 % ) . Life expectancy least 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/microL platelet great equal 100,000/microL total bilirubin le 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 3.0 time ULN creatinine less 1.5 time ULN OR : creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min patient creatinine level great equal 1.5 time ULN IPdR nucleoside analog therefore potentially teratogenic . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry 30 day study drug administration . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary IPdR administration mother , nurse mother receive IPdR . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients may receive investigational agent . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing uncontrolled infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , GI condition limit absorption , serious skin condition , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Women pregnant nursing . INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES : Both men woman member race ethnic group eligible trial .</criteria>
