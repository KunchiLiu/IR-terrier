	<criteria>Extreme Risk Only : Subject must comorbidities one cardiologist two cardiac surgeon agree medical factor preclude operation , base conclusion probability death serious morbidity exceed probability meaningful improvement . Specifically , predict operative risk death serious , irreversible morbidity ≥ 50 % 30 day . High Risk Surgical Only : Subject must comorbidities one cardiologist two cardiac surgeon agree predict risk operative mortality ≥15 % ( predict operative mortality serious , irreversible morbidity risk &lt; 50 % ) 30 day . Subject senile degenerative aortic valve stenosis : mean gradient &gt; 40 mmHg , jet velocity great 4.0 m/sec either rest dobutamine stress echocardiogram , simultaneous pressure recording cardiac catheterization ( either rest dobutamine stress ) , AND initial aortic valve area ≤ 0.8 cm2 ( aortic valve area index ≤ 0.5 cm2/m2 ) rest echocardiogram simultaneous pressure recording cardiac catheterization Subject symptomatic his/her aortic valve stenosis , demonstrate New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Functional Class II great . The subject subject 's legal representative inform nature trial , agree provision provide write informed consent approve IRB respective clinical site . The subject treating physician agree subject return require postprocedure followup visit . Clinical Evidence acute myocardial infarction ≤ 30 day intend treatment . Any percutaneous coronary peripheral interventional procedure perform within 30 day prior intend treatment . ( High Risk Surgical Only : Including bare metal stent . Additionally , drug elute stent place within 6 month prior index procedure . ) Blood dyscrasia define : leukopenia ( WBC &lt; 1000mm3 ) , thrombocytopenia ( platelet count &lt; 50,000 cells/mm3 ) , history bleed diathesis coagulopathy . Untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease require revascularization . Cardiogenic shock manifest low cardiac output , vasopressor dependence , mechanical hemodynamic support . Need emergency surgery reason . Severe ventricular dysfunction leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 20 % measure rest echocardiogram . Recent ( within 6 month ) cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) . End stage renal disease require chronic dialysis creatinine clearance &lt; 20 cc/min . Active Gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleed within past 3 month . A known hypersensitivity contraindication follow adequately premedicated : Aspirin Heparin ( HIT/HITTS ) Bivalirudin ( Extreme Risk Only ) Nitinol ( titanium nickel ) Ticlopidine clopidogrel Contrast medium Ongoing sepsis , include active endocarditis . Subject refuse blood transfusion . Life expectancy &lt; 12 month due associate noncardiac comorbid condition . Other medical , social , psychological condition opinion Investigator precludes subject appropriate consent . Severe dementia ( result either inability provide inform consent trial/procedure , prevents independent lifestyle outside chronic care facility , fundamentally complicate rehabilitation procedure compliance followup visit ) . Currently participate investigational drug another device trial . Symptomatic carotid vertebral artery disease . Subject offer surgical aortic valve replacement decline . ( High Risk Surgical Only ) Anatomical Native aortic annulus size &lt; 18 mm &gt; 29 mm per baseline diagnostic imaging . Preexisting prosthetic heart valve position . Mixed aortic valve disease ( aortic stenosis aortic regurgitation predominant aortic regurgitation ( 34+ ) ) . Moderate severe ( 34+ ) severe ( 4+ ) mitral severe ( 4+ ) tricuspid regurgitation . Moderate severe mitral stenosis . Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy . New untreated echocardiographic evidence intracardiac mass , thrombus vegetation . Severe basal septal hypertrophy outflow gradient . Aortic root angulation ( angle plane aortic valve annulus horizontal plane/vertebrae ) &gt; 70° ( femoral leave subclavian/axillary access ) &gt; 30° ( right subclavian/axillary access ) . Ascending aorta diameter &gt; 43 mm aortic annulus diameter 2329 mm ; ascend aorta diameter &gt; 40 mm aortic annulus diameter 2023 mm ; ascend aorta diameter &gt; 34 mm aortic annulus diameter 1820 mm . Congenital bicuspid unicuspid valve verify echocardiography . Sinus valsalva anatomy would prevent adequate coronary perfusion . Vascular Transarterial access able accommodate 18Fr sheath .</criteria>
