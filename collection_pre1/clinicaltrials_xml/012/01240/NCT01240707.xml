	<detailed_description>Fire smoke inhalation may contribute intrabronchial inflammation , airway obstruction impair gas exchange . The scope injury fire smoke victim range cough minor airway irritation severe respiratory failure long term mechanical ventilation Intensive Care Unit . Some patient high HbCO-levels also treat hyperbaric oxygen therapy . In study investigator examine scope inhalation injury assess soon admission base clinical marker , biochemical marker , Peak Expiratory Flow ( PEF ) , spirometry bronchoscopy . The clinical effect fiberoptic bronchoscopy severe smoke inhalation also examine . At 6 month lung function test metacholine test perform examine whether develop asthma/increased bronchial hyperreactivity initial fire smoke exposure . Lab staff ( flowcytometer cytokine analysis ) unaware patient identity whether patient smoke-exposed patient healthy volunteer control group non-exposed person .</detailed_description>
