	<brief_summary>Diaphragmatic dysfunction alteration thoracoabdominal motion common patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Several study describe impairment diaphragmatic mobility COPD patient compare age match control subject associate increase dyspnea , exercise intolerance mortality . COPD patient also experiment high activity accessory breathe muscle , greatly increase work breathe dyspnea sensation . Breathing strategy consider important component pulmonary rehabilitation refer range technique , including/which include diaphragmatic breathing ( DB ) . The principal aim DB improve participation abdominal motion reduce accessory muscle activity . The role DB adjunctive treatment modality rehabilitation COPD patient remain controversial . Despite conflict result , improvement abdominal motion reduction thoracic excursion , voluntarily DB , describe common find several study . The investigator hypothesize 4-week DBTP could induce high participation diaphragm modification would relieve respiratory symptom improve exercise tolerance HRQoL . Therefore , randomize control trial investigator aim test effect short-term DBTP thoracoabdominal motion , pulmonary function , diaphragmatic mobility , dyspnea , HRQoL exercise tolerance patient mild severe COPD .</brief_summary>
