	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare safety efficacy r-hLH r-hFSH late follicular phase young woman undergo controlled ovarian stimulation oocyte donation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use r-hLH ( Luveris ) Donors Previously Treated With r-hFSH ( Gonal F )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While role FSH consider fundamental driver folliculogenesis , role LH process controversial . FSH associate stimulate growth recruitment follicle LH associate selection dominant follicle destine ovulation . We use open , prospective , cross-over study compare safety efficacy two different treatment protocol control ovarian stimulation egg donor . 20 participant undergo two cycle stimulation . The first one r-hFSH though cycle second r-hFSH r-hLH . The participant 1 month rest cycle treatment cycle . r-hFSH dos adjust accord patient response . r-hLH dose begin 2 follicle great equal 14mm diameter . The 300IU/day continue day r-hCG administration .</detailed_description>
