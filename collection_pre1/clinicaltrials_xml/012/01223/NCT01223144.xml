	<brief_summary>The present study aim investigate cognitive function require orbitofrontal control , namely decision-making facial emotion recognition . The investigator hypothesize decision-making facial emotion recognition impair patient essential tremor ( ET ) due frontal lobe dysfunction may consequences daily social life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Decision-making Emotion Recognition Essential Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Beyond tremor , ET patient display wide spectrum clinical abnormality ataxia , deafness , olfactory disturbance , cognitive dysfunction personality change . Cognitive dysfunction mainly consist dysexecutive syndrome . Personality change characterize increased harm avoidance . These finding suggest complex modification frontal lobe function ET patient , include aspect dorsolateral orbitofrontal control . Previous study exclusively focus dorsolateral prefrontal control , orbitofrontal aspect remain elucidated . Orbitofrontal area involve process emotion reward , well normal social behavior . Dysfunction region may direct consequence daily social life . We hypothesize decision-making facial emotion recognition impair ET patient due frontal lobe dysfunction may consequences daily social life . The first aspect assess Iowa Gambling Task , simple paradigm simulate real-life decision-making . Briefly , player give four deck card , loan $ 2,000 ask play lose least amount money win . Turning card carry immediate reward sometimes unpredictable penalty . Decks A B disadvantageous lead overall loss money , deck C D advantageous overall gain money . In contrast control subject , patient damage orbitofrontal ventromedian cortex continue perseverate bad deck , sometimes even though know lose money overall . The second aspect , i.e . recognition facial emotion assess simple paradigm patient choose best fitting response among six facial expression ( happiness , sadness , fear , surprise , disgust anger ) present random order . All study subject test Benton Visual Retention Test exclude impairment visual perception , visual memory visuoconstructive ability . Performances Iowa Gambling Task facial emotion recognition test compare ET patient control . All study subject also test follow battery : Modified Card Sorting Test , Stroop , Trail Making Test Verbal Fluency , Beck Depression Inventory Mattis Dementia Rating Scale . These test allow assess impact executive function , depression memory loss performance Iowa Gambling Task facial emotion recognition test . Finally , performance Iowa Gambling Task facial emotion recognition test relate sex , age , disease duration tremor severity .</detailed_description>
