	<brief_title>Fall Risk Assessment Inpatient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introductions : Fall important challenging question among acute care long-term care facility . The average incidence rate fall approximately 40 % total anomalous report among hospital United States . Fallers may suffer many severe injury , include fracture brain concussion . Even fall become interesting popular topic medical issue , effort precaution fall incident still evident . After Wanfang Hospital establish 1997 , fall problem associate inpatient faller one emphasize issue medical care . Since 1998 , begin implement policy screen risk factor associate fall involve precautionary measure faller . But result come effectively . Specific Aims : The specific aim research proposal follow : 1 . Among inpatient , investigate causes/reasons risk factor associate faller incidence rate fall . The consequence relate fall also study . 2 . We evaluate strategy efficacy precautionary measure inpatients faller . Experimental design : The `` Observational cohort experimental design '' apply research proposal . Data collection : 1 . Data collect mainly ward medicine surgery . The project period 1/1/2009 12/31/2009 . 2 . The inpatient history , diagnosis , prescribe drug , hemoglobin value , blood sugar value inpatients faller collect analyzed . 3 . Associations variable fall among individual faller assess evaluate thoroughly . If fall incident actually occur , data patient fall gather within 48 hr compare relevant individual case full evaluator . Statistical analysis The Student-t test , Chi-square test , one-way ANOVA preform whole experimental data analysis . Goals future prospect : 1 . To finish survey high risk factor ratio high incidence rate associate fall among inpatient faller . 2 . To investigate risk factor associate fall consequential analysis relate fall among inpatient faller . 3 . A good precautionary measure fall reduce damage injury faller , especially inpatient welfare . Our accomplishment research proposal provide sufficient information reference precautionary strategy associate fall incident . More importantly , experience result explore share among hospital .</detailed_description>
