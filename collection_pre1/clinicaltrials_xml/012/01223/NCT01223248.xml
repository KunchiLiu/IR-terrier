	<brief_summary>The purpose study find way give high-dose radiation work best treatment cancer spread bone , spine , soft tissue , lymph node . This study look effect , good and/or bad , give 27 Gy three fraction ( 3 day ) 24 Gy one fraction ( 1 day ) use image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IG-IMRT ) . IG-IMRT radiation give directly cancer site reduce exposure normal tissue . Currently study compare effect give radiation either hypofractionated dos ( high total dos radiation spread several treatment day ) single-fraction dose ( entire radiation dose give one treatment session ) . The patient may ask participate additional part study get ( DW/DCE ) MRI treatment start within one hour radiation treatment . If patient ask take part portion study , need get 3 MRIs standard contrast injection . The purpose see result treatment change blood flow go cancer could suggest treatment may successful . In addition patient present new lesion may ask would like new lesion treat protocol . If give option , extend follow period . The follow new lesion match prior follow date .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis cancer ( include epithelial carcinoma , sarcoma , melanoma ) The diagnosis do MSKCC participate institution . Sites metastatic disease treat protocol limit bone , spine , soft tissue , lymph node . Patients American Joint Committee Cancer ( 6th edition , 2002 ) Stage IV cancer distant metastases Age 18 year old Life expectancy &gt; 3 month Maximum tumor dimension ≤6 cm lymph node , soft tissue , osseous metastasis , spinal metastasis see image ( compute tomography [ CT ] , magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] , PET/CT ) consider amenable RT . If lesion ( ) treat softtissue lymph Nodes unidimensionally measurable disease require . Bone &amp; spine lesion eligible even consider nonmeasurable . Measurable disease define : ≥ 10mm softtissue lesion ≥ 15mm short axis lymph node KPS ≥ 80 Patients must normal bone marrow function define : ( within 2 month registration ) Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dl Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500/μl Platelets ≥100,000/μl Prior radiotherapy deliver target region Disease treat protocol le 2 mm spinal cord therefore meet dose constraints* Pregnancy BreastFeeding ( Participants childbearing potential eligible must consent use effective contraception therapy least 3 month complete therapy ) . Chemotherapy give day plan radiotherapy treatment Lesions comprise &gt; 70 % width weight bearing bone , femur . Existing cortical bone destruction , orthopedic stabilization would require . Areas treat protocol include metastasis liver , brain lung . Note : Patients eligible ineligible lesion accrue protocol . Only target eligible lesion treat per protocol . Other eligible ineligible lesion treat discretion treat physician . ''</criteria>
