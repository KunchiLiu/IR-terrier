	<brief_summary>This exploratory study compare effect ranibizumab treatment conventional macular laser therapy patient diabetic macular oedema . The study hypothesise treatment ranibizumab may superior laser treatment term improve vision decrease retinal thickness . Patients randomise receive either repeat injection ranibizumab every 4 week 48 week macular laser therapy every 12 week 48 week . At baseline , 12 , 24 48 week , patient undergo detailed test provide information structure function retina treatment .</brief_summary>
