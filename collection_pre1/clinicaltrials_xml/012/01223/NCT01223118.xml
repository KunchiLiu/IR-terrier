	<brief_title>Evaluation Impact Vitrification Oocytes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study recruit patient NY/NJ/CT/eastern PA area . Cryopreservation human oocytes great potential preserve extend fertility face disease whose treatment would result loss ovarian function . ( malignancy , severe autoimmune disease , etc. ) . It would also provide mean quarantine oocyte use oocyte donation provide low possible risk infection . There two method storage oocyte : slow freeze vitrification . Slow freeze conventional method successfully use embryo since 1983 recently oocytes . Recent report indicate vitrification may successful slow freezing . However , technique rigorously validated date . The aim study determine rate cryosurvival mature oocytes follow vitrification , compare reproductive potential vitrify oocyte relative cryopreserved . Patients undergo ovarian stimulation vitro fertilization ( IVF ) accord protocol recommend primary doctor . After retrieval , mature oocyte divide half . One half undergo vitrification , immediate thaw intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) . The half undergo ICSI . All embryos develop identical culture day 3 day 5 . Prior transfer , best embryo group undergo biopsy genetic fingerprinting . The patient 2 embryo transfer ( one group ) . All extra embryo biopsied pre-implantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) prior cryopreserved . If patient becomes pregnant , follow additional blood draw approximately 9 week gestation buccal swab delivery infant ( ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>This study recruit patient NY/NJ/CT/eastern PA area . 1 . No prior fail IVF treatment cycle 2 . Female partner le 35 year age time onset IVF cycle 3 . Normal maximum prior day 3 follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level ( &lt; = 10 IU/L ) 4 . Total basal antral follicle count great equal 12 5 . Male partner great 100,000 total motile spermatozoon Donor sperm acceptable couple require provide one additional vial DNA analysis 6 . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) â‰¤ 32 kg/m2 1 . Diagnosis chronic oligoovulation anovulation ( cycle typically occur less often every 38 day ) 2 . Diagnosis endometrial insufficiency 3 . Clinical indication PGD ( undergo IVF PGD rule know genetic defect ) 4 . Use testicular aspiration biopsy procedure obtain sperm 5 . Unevaluated ovarian mass 6 . Presence hydrosalpinges communicate endometrial cavity 7 . Any contraindication undergo vitro fertilization gonadotropin stimulation</criteria>
