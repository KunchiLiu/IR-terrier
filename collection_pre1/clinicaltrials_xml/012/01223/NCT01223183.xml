	<brief_summary>Blockage breathe tubes lung thick , sticky mucus major cause lung problem people cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . Many researcher believe people CF absorb much water inside lung , mucus lung become thick sticky enough water . The investigator try develop way measure fast water absorb breathe tube lung investigator quickly test new medication develop fix problem CF patient . The investigator already do study show people CF absorb particular radioactive drug ( Indium-111 DTPA In-DTPA ) lungs quickly people without CF . Now investigators try prove absorption drug relate absorption water . The investigator measure absorption In-DTPA delivering aerosol ( inhaled mist ) along another radioactive drug ( Technetium 99m sulfur colloid ) . This drug help u measure much material clear lung way ( like cough ) without absorb . In study , investigator measure absorption In-DTPA affect inhale isotonic saline hypertonic saline ( salt water ) , investigator know affect absorption water airway .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There substantial need new biomarkers study cystic fibrosis ( CF ) lung disease . Conventional endpoint , rate FEV1 decline , require prolonged trial large sample size demonstrate therapeutic efficacy . Ideally biomarkers would provide quantitative window basic aspect CF pathophysiology , allow development evaluation therapy prior large scale clinical trial . The basic defect CF lung disease occur airways dysfunction cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) epithelial sodium ( ENaC ) channel think create ionic gradient cause excessive liquid absorption across epithelium . This result dehydrate airway surface liquid ( ASL ) layer , defective mucociliary clearance , increase proclivity infection inflammation . Aerosol-based method develop measure mucociliary clearance lung use demonstrate efficacy inhale osmotic therapy . We develop aerosol technique measure mucociliary clearance absorptive clearance hydrophilic small molecule ( Diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid - DTPA ) whole , central , peripheral lung region . We estimate DTPA absorption deliver aerosol contain Indium 111 DTPA ( In-DTPA ) Technetium 99m sulfur colloid ( Tc-SC ) airways . The clearance radiopharmaceutical image independently two separate clearance curve calculate . In-DTPA clear absorption mucociliary clearance Tc-SC clear mucociliary route . The difference clearance rate radiopharmaceuticals provide estimate DTPA absorption rate . Our previous study demonstrate absorption Indium-111 label DTPA occur high rate central ( airway dominate ) lung zone CF subject compare control ( 42 vs. 32 % /hr , CF n= 9 , control n=10 , p=0.03 ) . We believe increase DTPA absorption cause increased liquid absorption occur airway , however potential cause increase tight junction permeability epithelial denuding . In study propose measure DTPA absorption delivery intervention know affect liquid absorption airways see change DTPA absorption mirror change liquid absorption know caused intervention .</detailed_description>
