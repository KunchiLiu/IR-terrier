	<brief_summary>Objective/Rationale : The investigator objective demonstrate intervention program base motor learn principle apply train subject Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) suffer freeze walk way minimize occurrence freezing . Since sufficient motor learn capability preserve PD , investigator hypothesize intervention program target time period prior approach freeze episode modify walk strategy episode avert . Project Description : The freeze burden quantified subject PD 6 week train . Two type intervention ( 20 subject group ) test : 1 ) Open-loop group ( OLG ) ; 2 ) Closed-loop group ( CLG ) . Each session OLG training include walk course aim provoke freeze episode . The experimenter trigger auditory rhythmic stimulation ( RAS ) walk condition likely invoke freezing ( e.g. , turn ) subject learn synchronize his/her gait auditory cue , i.e. , keep walk pace coordination , result , avoid freezing . Similar principle apply CLG training ; however , RAS elicit automatically device recognizes approach freeze episode . Relevance Diagnosis/Treatment Parkinson 's Disease : If even partially successful , investigator show , first time freeze gait amenable motor learn appropriate training external cueing alleviate motor blockade . While future study need assess long-term efficacy important question clinical efficacy mechanism involve , study go long way towards improve investigator understand freeze gait amenability appropriate therapy . Anticipated Outcome : The investigator anticipate intensive training , central nervous system ( CNS ) subject PD able anticipate impend freeze episode base awareness environmental condition ( e.g. , approach turn ) and/or base sub-conscious response deteriorate gait pattern . As result , automate motor response pace coordinate gait internally trigger CNS approach freeze episode avert . The overall freezing burden therefore decrease trained subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overview : This randomized trial demonstrate effect 6-weeks train open-loop trigger , closed-loop cueing . PD+ FOG patient study 6 week training ( total 18 session ) one month later ( begin assess retention ) . The two intervention group receive training session design enhance implicit motor learn avoidance FOG . This first study ass novel paradigm . If result support hypothesis , study need include placebo-controlled trial . 20 subject include feed-forward , open-loop group ( OLG ) 20 feedback , closed-loop group ( CLG ) ( base power analysis provide 80 % power Î±=0.05 ) . Participants recruit roll admission basis ( 2 subject per week ~20 week ) randomly assign one 2 group . Pre , post retention effect test without knowledge group assignment . A ( repeat measure ) mixed model statistical approach use evaluate within across group effect time , adjust baseline value . The study conduct auspex Laboratory Gait Neurodynamics Movement Disorders Unit ( MDU ) Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center . At time train testing , subject closely monitor research assistant ensure safety .</detailed_description>
