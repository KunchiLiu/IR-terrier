	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular Diseases ( CVD ) accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) lead cause death represent 30 % global deaths 48 % death Europe . Moreover , current trend predict increase death cause Cardiovascular Diseases next year . Secondary preventive effort decrease mortality risk well improve health among Cardiovascular Disease patient . This study suggest innovative approach support self-management Cardiovascular Disease patient rehabilitation . The implied Randomized Controlled Trial two arm aim investigate effectiveness tailor Information Communication Technology ( ICT ) base intervention . The tailor base concept derive health psychology theory , contribute development . More specifically : - Aim 1 : To assess need CVD rehabilitation patient potentially meet use ICT . - Aim 2 : To assess effect tailor Internet-based intervention maintenance self-management behavior rehabilitation stay . Hypothesis : The intervention group ( tailor ) high adherence ) Internet-based intervention , b ) self-management . - Aim 3 : To assess effect mobile technology activity sensor physical activity . Hypothesis : There relationship data collect activity sensor self-reported physical activity level .</brief_summary>
