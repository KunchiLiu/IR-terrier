	<detailed_description>Several previous multicenter study use intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) image reveal statin attenuate progression atherosclerosis even provide regression plaque volume . Indeed , Japan Assessment Pitavastatin Atorvastatin Acute Coronary Syndrome ( JAPAN-ACS ) trial [ NCT00242944 ] reveal early aggressive statin therapy patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) significantly reduce plaque volume non-culprit coronary lesion On hand , direct relationship atheroma progression regression IVUS clinical event clearly define . To verify relationship , long term follow JAPAN-ACS study perform . Clinical outcome patient regress plaque progress plaque compare . In addition , objective study evaluate effect serum lipid level different type statin cardiovascular prevention .</detailed_description>
