	<detailed_description>Pioglitazone show potent anti-inflammatory well anti-atherosclerotic effect . However , mechanisms pioglitazone exerts effect clear . We propose tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase-3 ( TIMP-3 ) TNF-alfa convert enzyme ( TACE ) play major role pioglitazone mediate improvement insulin sensitivity endothelial function . In animal model , low dose pioglitazone inhibits lesion progression matrix metalloproteinase expression advance atherosclerotic plaque . We believe low dose Pioglitazone also anti-inflammatory effect without potential adverse effect weight gain . In order examine effect low dose Pioglitazone ( 15mg/day ) TIMP-3 TACE Pioglitazone mediate improvement insulin sensitivity endothelial function , propose study subject type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) participate follow study : ( ) OGTT ; ( ii ) DXA body fat content , ( iii ) euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp , ( iv ) skeletal muscle biopsy . This study examine effect Pioglitazone ( 1 ) TIMP TACE substrate activity skeletal muscle relationship insulin sensitivity adipocytokines- resistin , TNF-α Visfatin ; ( 2 ) marker inflammation atherosclerosis- C-reactive protein , VCAM-1 , ICAM-1 , endothelin 1 , E-selectin , P-selectin , TNFrecI , TNFrecII , IL-6 rec . Fifteen subject receive placebo 15 receive pioglitazone . Study Design . Double blind placebo control parallel design . ENDPOINTS PRIMARY : Reduction TIMP-3 TACE gene expression TACE substrate activity skeletal muscle adipose tissue.. SECONDARY : Improvement : ( 1 ) Skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity , ( 2 ) plasma FFA ( Free Fatty Acid ) lipid level ( 3 ) reduction VCAM ICAM concentration . RESEARCH PLAN - EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL Subjects - We plan study subject T2DM ( BMI 30-40 Kg/m2 , age=18-70 year , HbA1c &lt; 10 % ) ; equal number subject group receive placebo/study drug . With study design , able discriminate effect pioglitazone TIMP3 TACE substrate activity gene expression patient T2DM non-diabetic subject metabolic syndrome . Subjects arm study ( placebo study drug ) match age , BMI HbA1c effect Pioglitazone subject independent glucose lower effect drug . Diabetic subject previously receive insulin take thiazolidinedione exclude . Only diabetic patient free major organ disease study . Only subject whose body weight stable least three month participate strenuous exercise study . Prior start pioglitazone subject participate follow study : ( ) Qualification visit : Physical examination , medical history , EKG tracing , complete blood cell count , SMA 24 lipid profile perform . Also , fast level plasma total/HDL/LDL cholesterol , triglyceride , marker atherosclerosis inflammation ( CRP : C-reactive protein ) , hypercoagulability ( plasminogen activator inhibitor -1 ) , adiponectin , TNF-α , HbA1c measure day . ( ii ) OGTT ( 75 gram ) evaluate overall glucose tolerance insulin secretion . Biopsy vastus lateralis muscle perform 30 minute start OGTT . ( iii ) Measurement lean body mass fat free mass Dual Energy Xray Absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan . ( iv ) Brachial artery reactivity post ischemic flow mediate vasodilation response sublingual Nitroglycerine do day DXA do . Upon completion study , subject randomly assign receive either placebo pioglitazone dose 15 mg day 24 week . Subjects receive dietary counseling prior initiation pioglitazone therapy ask consume standard ADA , weight maintain diet throughout study . Patients see follow every 2 week . On follow visit interim medical history , blood pressure , pulse , weight fast plasma glucose concentration determine . Every 4 week TIMP TACE substrate activity , adiponectin , visfatin , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) marker inflammation atherosclerosis ( VCAM-1 , ICAM-1 , endothelin 1 , E-selectin , P-selectin ) measure . In addition , every month measure HbA1c , plasma lipid liver function test . After 24 week pioglitazone treatment subject repeat : ( ) measurement fat lean body mass DXA , ( ii ) OGTT , ( iii ) vastus lateralis biopsy . The total length study start pioglitazone/placebo 26-30 week . The baseline study perform period 1 4 week . The repeat study perform last 24-30 week pioglitazone therapy . Methods OGTT AND PERCUTANEOUS SKELETAL MUSCLE BIOPSY All subject admit General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) South Texas Veterans Healthcare System , Audie Murphy Division , San Antonio , Texas day study 6:45 8 AM . Subjects allow eat drink anything 10 PM night , study complete . At 7:30 AM subject ingest 75 gram glucose . Plasma sample glucose , insulin C-peptide concentration drawn -30 , -15 , 0 minute every 15 minute thereafter two hour . At 30 minute start OGTT , muscle biopsy vastus lateralis muscle perform . After injection xylocaine , 5 mm incision make 10-15 cm patella , biopsy needle inserted muscle . The needle connected suction , approximately 200 mg muscle tissue obtain . All muscle biopsy store liquid nitrogen within 15 second , process specific assay . We able derive OGTT reliable estimate insulin secretion well insulin sensitivity calculate `` MATSUDA '' index well OGIS ( Oral Glucose Insulin Sensitivity ) index . These index show repeatedly correlate extremely well result obtain euglycemic clamp . Three seven day later , body fat content determine DXA . EUGLYCEMIC HYPERINSULINEMIC CLAMP : On separate day , subject admit General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) South Texas Veterans Healthcare System , Audie Murphy Division , San Antonio , Texas , 6:45 8 AM hyper-insulinemic euglycemic ( 80 mU ( milli-Unit ) /m2•min ) clamp . Continuous indirect calorimetry ( Deltatrac , Sensormedics , Anaheim , CA ) perform 30 minute prior start insulin clamp , 150-180 minute period insulin clamp calculate rate glucose lipid oxidation . After obtain basal sample insulin , C-peptide , prim dose insulin give first 10 minute follow constant infusion . At 5 minute variable rate glucose infuse maintain plasma glucose ~100mg/dl 180minutes . Upon completion study , subject ( diabetic , non diabetic metabolic syndrome ) start pioglitazone dose 15 mg day continue 24 week . Subjects receive dietary counseling prior initiation pioglitazone therapy ask consume standard ADA , weight maintain diet throughout study . Patients see follow every 2 week . On follow visit interim medical history , blood pressure , pulse , weight fast plasma glucose concentration determine . Every month measure HbA1c , plasma lipid , liver function test , adipocytokines , inflammatory marker describe earlier . After 4 month pioglitazone treatment subject repeat : ( ) measurement fat lean body mass DXA , ( ii ) OGTT vastus lateralis biopsy .</detailed_description>
