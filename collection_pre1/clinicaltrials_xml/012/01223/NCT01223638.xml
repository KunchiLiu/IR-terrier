	<brief_summary>Congenital hypothyroidism ( CH ) occur 1:4000 live birth . Neurological disturbance like speech delay , motor delay lower IQ report child CH . Evidence animal experiment indicate CH associate high frequency deafness . Morphological change external internal cholera hair report mutagenic mouse CH . Anatomical change internal ear low hearing threshold report mice bearing Dual oxidase 2 ( Duox2 ) gene mutation , responsible oxidation iodide . Knockout Pax8 gene mouse result agenesis thyroid gland deafness . Early L-thyroxin therapy prevent development deafness mouse . The expression thyroid receptor α ( TRα ) external internal cholera hair mouse indicate thyroid hormone important role development internal ear . The etiology deafness human genetic environmental . The prevalence deafness live birth 1:1000 among 60 % genetic . Connexin 26 gene mutation common cause inherited deafness account 40 % genetic case . In two condition human coexistence hypothyroidism deafness report ; Pendred syndrome thyroid hormone resistance syndrome . The prevalence hearing loss human CH explore study result contrary . The aim current study study prevalence hearing loss among child CH compare clinical , biochemical genetic characteristic subject hear loss without hear loss .</brief_summary>
