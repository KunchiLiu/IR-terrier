	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability Efficacy Lytixar™ ( LTX-109 ) Uncomplicated , Gram-positive , Skin Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment uncomplicated , Gram-positive , skin infection may include application antiseptic desiccant , importantly topical antibiotic . Guidance use antimicrobial therapy publish , poor prescribing practice still exist facilitate development bacterial strain resistant available therapy . The issue antimicrobial resistance particularly important Gram-positive cocci Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pyogenes . Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) problem many year hospital setting , recently community acquire MRSA ( CA-MRSA ) emerge pose additional challenge physician manage skin infection . The medicinal product development , Lytixar™ , synthetic antimicrobial peptidomimetic agent membrane lysing mode action . Lytixar™ demonstrate activity several Gram-positive Gram-negative bacteria vitro . The compound appear equally effective antibiotic-resistant specie methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , vancomycin resistant Enterococci ( VRE ) multi-resistant Pseudomonas isolates . The novel membrane lysing mode action may result low propensity development resistance date Lytixar™ demonstrate vitro target-specific cross-resistance class antibiotic .</detailed_description>
