	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 ) compare mortality postoperative morbidity extremely low birth weight ( ELBW ) infants underwent initial laparotomy drainage necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) isolate intestinal perforation ( IP ) ; 2 ) determine ability distinguish NEC IP preoperatively importance distinction outcome measure ; 3 ) evaluate association extent intestinal disease determine operation outcome measure . All ELBW infant bear participate NRN center screen presence NEC IP think pediatric surgeon neonatologist require surgical intervention . Data collect enrolled infant , include : intraoperative finding record surgeon specific post-operative complication . Neurodevelopmental examination conduct survive infant 18-22 month correct age .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Observational Study Surgical Treatment Necrotizing Enterocolotis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) condition , generally affect premature infant , intestine become ischemic ( lack oxygen and/or blood flow ) . NEC occur 5-15 % extremely low birth weight ( ELBW ) infant . Isolated focal intestinal perforation ( IP ) less common condition , affect estimate 4 % ELBWs , hole develop intestine leak fluid abdomin . The outcomes infant NEC IP poor : 49 % die half survive infant neurodevelopmentally impaired . Surgical option NEC IP include two possible procedure : peritoneal drainage , tube place abdominal cavity small incision fluid drain ; laparotomy , incision make abdomen diseased intestine remove . Infants treat initial drainage sometimes go need laparotomy . Most surgeon believe diagnosis intestinal perforation ( IP ) may actually either true NEC different distinct pathology , term isolated intestinal perforation . The ability distinguish 2 condition preoperatively , base perinatal characteristic , physical examination finding , finding abdominal plain film imaging , remain unknown . If 2 entity distinguish preoperatively , intervention choose outcome may different . From two available surgical option , tt know whether initial laparotomy peritoneal drain placement effective either NEC IP . This study prospective , multicenter observational study describe surgical outcome ( mortality , post-operative intestinal stricture , intra-abdominal abscess formation , etc . ) ELBW infant either NEC IP underwent initial laparotomy peritoneal drainage . We also evaluate ability surgeon distinguish NEC IP pre-operatively relevance distinction outcome . Finally , analysis impact extent intestinal involvement NEC outcome measure report . All ELBW infant bear participate NRN center screen presence NEC IP think pediatric surgeon neonatologist require surgical intervention . Data collect enrolled infant , include : intraoperative finding record surgeon specific post-operative complication . Neurodevelopmental examination conduct survive infant 18-22 month correct age .</detailed_description>
