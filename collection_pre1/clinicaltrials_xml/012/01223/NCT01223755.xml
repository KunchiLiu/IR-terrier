	<detailed_description>Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease ( ADPKD ) common hereditary renal disease , responsible 8 % 10 % case end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) Western Countries . ADPKD show genetic heterogeneity , least three different gene implicate : PKD1 gene ( 85 % case ) , PKD2 ( 15 % case ) , probably PDK3 gene yet identify . Recently , report PC1 tail interacts tuberin , product TSC2 gene . The main function tuberin inactivate Ser/Thr kinase mTOR , whose activity link increase cell growth , proliferation , apoptosis differentiation . In ADPKD experimental animal model , researcher show cyst line epithelial cell exhibit high mTOR activity ; thus , hypothesize PC1 normally suppress mTOR activity , defect PC1 ( protein ) may lead aberrant mTOR activation . Studies rat model ADPKD show short-term treatment sirolimus ( SRL ) result dramatic reduction kidney size . Recently document ADPKD patient normal kidney function moderate renal dysfunction short-course SRL halt cyst growth increase parenchyma volume . At effective SRL dose ( target trough blood level 5-10 ng/ml ) relevant adverse effect observe patient development aphthous stomatitis , relieve topical treatment alone use mouthwash . Interestingly retrospective study small number SRL-treated ADPKD transplant patient show treatment significantly reduce native kidney volume average 24 month follow-up . This reduction three time higher report control group ADPKD transplant recipient give SRL 40 month period . These result suggest SRL may similar beneficial effect human experimental animal . Overall , findings basis design study ADPKD patient severe renal dysfunction ( GFR 40-15 ml/min/1.73m2 ) aim assess safety efficacy SRL slow renal function decline compare conventional therapy .</detailed_description>
