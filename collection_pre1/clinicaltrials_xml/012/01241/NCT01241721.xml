	<brief_title>Pre-Surgery Positron Emission Mammography Patients With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research Phase 1 determine low dose radionuclide 18F-FDG use Diagnostic use Positron Emission Mammography diagnosis multifocal breast cancer patient wish Breast Conservation Surgery newly diagnose breast cancer . Low dose injection ( radioactive count ) 18F-FDG compare equivalent radioactive count standard high dose 10 millicurie use standard PEM study current clinical practice . Images post process computer aid software place two category : Low dose group , high dose group . Images randomly blind reader assess ability see positive lesion warrant biopsy include current surgical planning prior breast conservation surgery mastectomy . Images assess ability see PEM positive lesion low dose image compare ability see PEM positive lesion standard high dose image . Each three breast cancer category assess Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma , Lobular infiltrate Carcinoma , Ductal Carcinoma Insitu . Phase 1 30 patient . The purpose research Phase 2 use low dose identify Phase 1 image primary breast cancer patient identify breast MRI unsuspected second lesion breast expect Mammography Ultrasound require biopsy diagnosis prior biopsy compare reliability PEM MRI identify breast cancer 2nd site . Parameters assess include standard statistical analysis sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value negative predictive value MRI PEM image new low radionuclide dose select Phase 1 . Phase 2 100 patient .</detailed_description>
