	<detailed_description>There lack objective data relate variation treatment practice resource utilisation Multiple Myeloma ( MMY ) patient country . This void continue hamper attempt create meaningful health economic model MMY treatment impedes understand MMY clinical arena . This non-interventional observational study design address problem provide definitive picture routine treatment resource utilisation practice MMY patient stage treatment , independent drug ( ) use treatment line across different country take part . A non-interventional study design select facilitate data collection routine clinical practice . This study seek obtain appropriate subset true population patient MMY throughout Europe Middle East Africa . Many concern exist attempt develop unbiased study sample , include bias regard selection patient enrol . Therefore , multi-staged site patient selection model use reduce bias associate patient site selection . The study seek enroll least 3,000 patient . It deliver description everyday treatment practice MMY . Additional retrospective medical review also perform collect information regard disease history . The primary objective study document describe current treatment regimen disease progression patient MMY . Secondary objective study involve understand MMY patient population generalisability treat MMY patient . Additional goal study document compare : ( ) utilisation current treatment regimen MMY ; ( b ) quality life health economic parameter associate MMY treatment regimen ; ( c ) safety profile current treatment regimen MMY impact resource utilisation ; ( ) effectiveness current treatment regimen MMY . The study collect prospective data efficacy , outcomes , health economic safety parameter patient whenever available . The result database allow future health economic , pharmaco-epidemiological , outcomes research , provide important data clinical arena . At least 3000 patient recruit study . As observational study , decision patient take part study impact care receive . All treatment decision make discretion participate physician . Only data available routine clinical practice collect . There two phase data collection study : ( ) baseline , patient 's historical treatment resource utilisation data , possible stretch back diagnosis , record via electronic data capture ; ( b ) follow baseline visit , patient enter prospective data collection phase data collect least every three month . At data collection point , change since previous data collection point collect . Prospective data collection continue study complete patient withdrawn study . Data continue capture three year last patient recruit study . Interim analyse conduct least annually update current data . To monitor safety profile MMY treatment relate Johnson Johnson product , unwanted effect occur MMY treatment record Observational Study - No investigational drug administer</detailed_description>
