	<brief_summary>To determine response combination azacitidine + lenalidomide patient relapsed/refractory CLL SLL Hypothesize - lenalidomide 's activity combination azacitidine may enhance activity durability treatment response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Examining Combination Lenalidomide Azacitidine Relapsed/Refractory CLL SLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A promising untested combination CLL combination lenalidomide DNA methyltransferase inhibitor azacitidine . The combination lenalidomide azacitidine novel CLL , test phase I clinical trial involve patient MDS find safe promising activity disease . Studying activity combination CLL may allow u shift CLL treatment paradigm cytotoxic chemo-immunotherapies therapy towards epigenetic-immunomodulatory approach offer unique opportunity understand complex biology disease , mechanism resistance interaction microenvironment .</detailed_description>
