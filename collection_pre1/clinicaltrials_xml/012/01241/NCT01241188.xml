	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis ( TB ) continue important bacterial infection worldwide therefore new improve diagnostic test need help doctor diagnose TB . The new skin test name C-Tb . Like current Tuberculin Skin Test ( TST ) , C-Tb test inject skin positive show redness and/or swell injection site negative test leave reaction . The aim trial test C-Tb skin test adult diagnose TB determine TB infect individual truly positive test result ( call find sensitivity skin test ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial C-Tb Skin Test , When Given Intradermally Adult Patients Recently Diagnosed With Active Tuberculosis ( TB )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial design investigate sensitivity C-Tb use various size cut-off induration double blind randomise , split-body study compare 0.1 µg/0.1 mL C-Tb reference agent 2 T.U . Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI . ( Each volunteer receive C-Tb agent one arm 2 T.U . Tuberculin PPD RT 23 SSI arm ) . Two group adult patient recently diagnose active TB investigate ; patient main group NOT co-infection HIV patient second group co-infection HIV . The C-Tb 2 TU Tuberculin PPD RT 23 SSI agent give concomitantly volunteer RIGHT AND LEFT forearm accord double blind randomisation scheme . The primary objective assess sensitivity C-Tb test function cut-off value ( i.e. , small size induration measure mm result positive outcome C-Tb test ) test administer intradermally Mantoux technique HIV negative adult patient recently diagnose active TB ass sensitivity C-Tb test function cut-off value ( i.e. , small size induration measure mm result positive outcome C-Tb test ) test administer intradermally Mantoux technique HIV positive adult patient recently diagnose active TB The sensitivity define relative frequency patient induration response ≥ cut-off TB patient . Similarly specificity C-Tb test define relative frequency subject healthy population ( i.e. , exposure M. tuberculosis ) induration response &lt; cut-off C-Tb test . An optimal cut-off point infect determine comb result present sensitivity study parallel specificity study ( BCG vaccinate ) individual previous exposure M. tuberculosis . The secondary objective trial compare induration response C-Tb induration response 2 T.U . Tuberculin PPD RT 23 SSI , compare induration response C-Tb in-vitro IFN-γ response measure screen use QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In Tube assay , correlate induration response initial CD4+ count HIV positive patient record adverse event ( local systemic ) occur within 28 day application agent</detailed_description>
