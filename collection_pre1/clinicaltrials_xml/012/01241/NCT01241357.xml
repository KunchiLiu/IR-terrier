	<brief_summary>The propose research project continue application development new method ( biomagnetic susceptometry ) measure magnetic field determine much iron liver . The amount iron liver best indicator amount iron whole body . Measuring amount iron body important either much ( iron overload ) little iron ( iron deficiency ) harmful . At present , reliable way measure amount iron liver remove sample liver biopsy , either surgery use needle pierce skin liver . Iron store liver magnetize small degree place magnetic field . In patient iron overload , investigator previous study show magnetic measurement liver iron patient iron overload quantitatively equivalent biochemical determination tissue obtain biopsy . In past investigator develop device measure amount magnetization , call SQUID ( Superconducting QUantum Interference Device ) susceptometer . This device validate use 20 year . The safety , ease , rapidity comfort magnetic measurement make frequent , serial study technically feasible practically acceptable patient . The investigator develop new susceptometer , use similar technology SQUID , investigator believe accurate precise . This study aim validate new instrument . The investigator prospective , serial study diagnosis management patient iron overload , include thalassemia major ( Cooley 's anemia ) , sickle cell disease , aplastic anemia , myelodysplasia , hereditary hemochromatosis , disorder .

	<brief_title>High-Tc Susceptometer Monitor Transfusional Iron Overload</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project validate new high-transition-temperature ( high-Tc ; operate 77°K , cool liquid nitrogen ) superconducting magnetic susceptometer clinically effective mean monitor iron overload patient require chronic red blood cell transfusion . Transfusional iron overload orphan disease develop patient require regular blood transfusion treatment variety refractory anemia orphan disorder , include sickle-cell disease , thalassemia major ( Cooley 's anemia ) , Diamond-Blackfan anemia , aplastic anemia , pure red cell aplasia , hypoplastic myelodysplastic disorder . In United States , number anemic patient transfusional iron overload estimate less 50,000 . Without iron-chelating therapy , potentially lethal amount iron accumulate patient . Because body lack effective mean eliminate excess iron , iron contain transfused red cell progressively deposit liver , heart , pancreas organ . Cirrhosis , heart failure , diabetes disorder develop . Treatment chelate agent capable sequester iron permit excretion body provide mean manage transfusional iron overload prolong survival avert ameliorate iron-induced organ damage . Two iron-chelating agent approve use U.S. treatment transfusional iron overload : ( 1 ) deferoxamine B ( Desferal® ) , parenteral agent use almost four decade , ( ii ) deferasirox ( Exjade® ) , orally administer agent introduced 2005 . With chelators , optimal management patient require careful monitor body iron prevent iron-induced toxicity avoid adverse effect excessive chelator administration . Our laboratory originally propose storage iron ( ferritin hemosiderin ) could non-invasively assessed vivo measurement magnetic susceptibility . We subsequently develop low-transition-temperature ( low-Tc ; operate 4°K , cool liquid helium ) superconducting quantum interference device ( SQUID ) susceptometry clinical method quantitation hepatic iron store . The transition temperature temperature electrical resistance superconducting material drop zero . The safety , ease , rapidity comfort magnetic measurement make frequent , serial investigation technically feasible practically acceptable patient . Susceptometry permit accurate , direct , reliable , repeat measurement hepatic iron store . Despite advantage , cost ( $ 1,000,000 per device ) , instrumental complexity need liquid-helium cool low-Tc susceptometers restrict clinical adoption method . Worldwide , four low-Tc susceptometers use clinically ( New York , Oakland , Hamburg Turin ) . Recently , support Bioengineering Research Partnership Grant ( R01 DK057209 ) , make series technological breakthrough instrumental innovation make possible replacement , redesign refinement element low-Tc susceptometer , operate 4°K liquid helium , component able function 77°K liquid nitrogen . This new high-Tc susceptometer , first medical device utilize phenomenon high-temperature superconductivity , inexpensive instrument easily use hospital environment . These Phase 2 clinical study design test hypothesis measurement hepatic iron store new high-Tc susceptometer clinically superior available method supply essential data need FDA approval medical device . The propose project three specific aim : 1. calibrate high-Tc susceptometer result biochemical analysis tissue liver explants adult pediatric patient undergo liver transplantation clinically indicate liver biopsy ; 2. prospectively validate high-Tc susceptometer use result biochemical analysis tissue liver explants adult pediatric patient undergo liver transplantation clinically indicate liver biopsy ; 3. prospectively compare measurement hepatic iron concentration high-Tc susceptometer ( ) estimate derive liver magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) relaxation rate ( R2 , R2* , signal intensity ratio ) , ( ii ) determination serum ferritin , ( iii ) histopathological examination , use biochemical analysis liver storage iron concentration reference standard . FDA approval affordable , readily usable instrument non-invasive measurement hepatic iron store would lead major advance management patient transfusional iron overload would find immediate widespread clinical use U.S. worldwide .</detailed_description>
