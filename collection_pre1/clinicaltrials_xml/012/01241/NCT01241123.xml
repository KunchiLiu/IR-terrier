	<brief_summary>`` Fast-track '' `` enhance recovery '' program , new standardize accelerated clinical pathway post-operative care colorectal surgery , three goal : 1 ) quicken return bowel function ( evidenced passage flatus stool ) , 2 ) decrease length hospital stay , 3 ) decrease rate overall complication . Aside several component , intervention vary institution institution , program share three common modality : early oral feeding , protocol pain management regimens less dependent opioid use , early mobilization ( i.e . ambulation ) . Evidence-based practice show modality individually contribute significantly program goal except post-operative ambulation , show increase bowel function although contributes decrease pulmonary complication early discharge patient . Still , surgeon continue advocate early ambulation aid return bowel function despite lack clear evidence support notion . The investigator propose randomize , prospective clinical trial explore impact post-operative ambulation outcome colorectal surgery , particularly return bowel function length hospital stay . With use pedometer measure physical activity , investigator subject patient either current traditional post-operative care one aggressive ambulation regimen . Through use radiopaque marker , investigator hope correlate increase ambulation increase gastrointestinal motility function prove impact early ambulation post-operative care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Subject patient undergo colorectal surgery NMCP . Colorectal surgery define surgery involve gastrointestinal tract ileocecal valve dentate line include laparoscopic approach . This surgery include , limited : Ileocecetomy Partial colectomy ( include right , leave , sigmoid colectomies ) Hartmann procedure Total abdominal colectomy Proctocolectomy Colostomy formation takedown Low anterior resection Abdominoperineal resection Reasons subject exclusion nonambulatory condition condition whereby subject walk move place place . Examples nonambulatory condition include limit : severe vasculopathy limit claudication ( leg pain ambulate due poor blood flow ) less 100 meter , wheelchair bound condition ( anatomically miss leg without adequate prosthesis , severely limit pulmonary disease , neurologic disorder Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis , severe multiple sclerosis , paraplegia ) , fracture leg bone require temporary and/or permanent use walk aid congenital disorder limit ambulation ( osteogenesis imperfecta , muscular dystrophy , cerebral palsy ) . Any patient take Alvimopan ( Entereg Â® ) exclude terminate study . Alvimopan FDAapproved drug accelerates bowel motility use prevent and/or treat postoperative ileus . In addition , patient underlie gastrointestinal motility issue , gastroparesis , chronic constipation , etc may complication may able ambulate hospital course ( i.e . prolong intubated postoperatively ) exclude well . Pregnant woman also exclude study .</criteria>
