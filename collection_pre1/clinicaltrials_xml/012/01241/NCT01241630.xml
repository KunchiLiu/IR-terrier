	<brief_title>Somato-sensory Reflex Arch Spinal Cord Injury - Effect Clinical Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Spinal cord injury profound impact life affect . Quality life restrict immobility also severe neurogenic bladder bowel dysfunction . For example , 66 % SCI patient empty rectum digitally , 75 % suffer faecal incontinence 9 % spend 60 minute time defecate . Neurological impairment due SCI permanent average age injury 28 year . The longevity individual SCI approach general population , accordingly , patient live several decade severe bladder bowel symptom . It estimate number individual SCI Denmark 3.000 year 10.000 person European Union sustain SCI . Even though clean intermittent catheterization successfully reduce mortality due urinary tract infection reflux though several new treatment modality neurogenic bowel dysfunction introduce , bladder bowel dysfunction still rank among top three cause impairment quality life SCI . Somato-sensory reflex arch : The concept pioneer professor Xiao . Animal study basic clinical research perform United States later human clinical study do Wuhan , China . The surgical procedure principle briefly summarize follow : All spinal nerve anterior efferent root posterior afferent root . For somato-sensory reflex arch ( `` Xiao procedure '' ) posterior ( afferent sensory ) root 5th lumbar nerve ( L5 ) keep anterior root cut anastomose anterior root lower segment , usually third sacral segment ( S3 ) . Thereby , new reflex arch create skin leg sensory part L5 spinal cord anastomosis via S2 S3 bladder bowel . Strong stimuli L5 dermatome , i.e . scratch electrical stimulation , initiate voiding ( 6,7 ) . Effects somato-sensory reflex arch neurogenic bowel dysfunction study , clinical experience indicate bowel management substantially facilitate . The Xiao procedure introduces completely new concept management spinal cord lesion greet optimism worldwide . The number patient operated China alone 3.000 centre United States , Germany Israel introduce modify . Furthermore , centre Australia , Finland Denmark plan introduce within present year . There , however , serious concern need address : Clinical follow-up do patient physiological study procedure equally small . In spite large number patient operated China logistic cultural factor prohibit effective follow-up . A minor improvement bladder bowel function may important Chinese patient without access treatment unknown whether Xiao procedure advantage patient western healthcare system . The mode action somato-sensory reflex arch incompletely study mode action bowel function study . Before widespread use somato-sensory reflex arch find utmost importance well design study validate even objective endpoint perform . Results study international impact either define indication completely new treatment principle , otherwise , prevent widespread use ineffective treatment . Hypotheses : In March 2009 core member multidisciplinary study team go study tour Wuhan , China . In Wuhan stagger number 600 patient somato-sensory reflex arch procedure perform 2008 . Based experience visit pose follow hypothesis : 1 . In `` western setting '' somato-sensory reflex arch create adult SCI patient minor morbidity complication . 2 . Somato-sensory reflex arch reduces bladder bowel symptom SCI patient . Patients Methods : Spinal cord injure patient Internationally , two indication somato-sensory reflex arch emerging : Adult patient bladder dysfunction due supraconal SCI ( conus medullaris ) Children bladder dysfunction due spinal bifida . Most child spinal bifida motor incomplete lesion , accordingly , surgical procedure carry risk long-lasting even permanent loss motor function - typically loss dorsiflexion foot . Whether result procedure justify risk remains determine . In contrast , patient motor complete supraconal SCI , thereby complete loss voluntary muscle function level injury , run risk . Therefore , decide patient group ) offer procedure Department Neurosurgery NK , AUH . Initially , 20 patient undergo procedure . As method new , surgery follow-up perform strict monitoring emphasis neurophysiologic test potential complication . Approval obtain Ethics Committee , patient carefully inform neurosurgeon ( Dorte Clemmensen ) inform consent sign . Surgical procedure : The relatively minor surgical procedure describe previously . In summary : A hemilaminectomy L5-S1 performed . By mean neurophysiology test 5th lumbar root 2nd 3rd sacral root identify one side . The perineurium open motor root separate sensory . The motor root transsected microanastomosis create L5 S2 S3 . After surgery sprouting occur 12-18 month reflex arch functional . Time till clinical effect therefore also 12-18 month . The advantage procedure perform hemilaminectomy two segment surgical stress relatively small . The patient expect habitual condition within 48 hour . Post surgical monitoring : Through informal contact agree complication basic functional result three centre adopt procedure ( Melbourne , Australia ; Helsinki , Finland ; Aarhus , Denmark ) record standardized way . Preliminary principle assessment agree upon centre introduce procedure future invite participate . This allow comparison result centre . Study A ) . Detailed assessment functional result somato-sensory reflex arch To patient main concern whether procedure safe reduces symptom . Detailed internationally accepted evaluation form adult SCI patient recently develop . The call International Spinal Cord Injury Data Sets endorse International Spinal Cord Organisation ( ISCoS ) American Spinal Cord Association ( ASIA ) . Information within data set mainly symptom base low urinary tract function urodynamic assessment include bowel function radiographically determine colorectal transit time include . From bowel function data set commonly use score bowel dysfunction , include Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score , develop unit , compute . Patients undergo surgical procedure assess use basic extend low urinary tract data set bowel function data set surgery 18 month . Before Based investigation , aim publish follow sub-studies : A1 ) . Prospective study urodynamic function bladder symptom somato-autonomic reflex arch spinal cord injury patient . A2 ) . Prospective study colorectal symptoms somato-autonomic reflex arch spinal cord injury patient . A3 ) . Prospective study colorectal transit time rectal wall property somato-autonomic reflex arch spinal cord injury patient .</detailed_description>
