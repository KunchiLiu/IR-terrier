	<brief_summary>Purpose : To compare diagnostic yield endoscopic ultrasound guide fine needle aspiration biopsy ( EUS-FNA ) patient pancreatic mass without use stylet place within biopsy needle . Hypothesis : In patient undergo EUS FNA pancreatic indication , patient fine needle aspiration biopsy ( FNA ) without internal stylet great diagnostic yield compare internal stylet . Justification : EUS-FNA increasingly important mean obtain tissue sample lesion within thorax abdomen . In experienced hand EUS-FNA safe alternative invasive procedure mediastinoscopy laparoscopy . EUS-FNA use sample suspected cholangiocarcinoma , pancreatic mass cyst , submucosal gastric lesion , peripancreatic , perigastric mediastinal lymph node case adrenal liver mass . Therefore , powerful tool diagnosis tumour staging . For example , diagnosis pancreatic adenocarcinoma , common indication EUS-FNA , sensitivity varies 75 &gt; 90 % , specificity 82-100 % mean accuracy 85 % . Improving diagnostic yield may lead early diagnosis reduce number investigation earlier institution treatment patient . The FNA needle system consist 22 19 gauge needle manipulate handle piston attache biopsy channel endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) linear scope . The tip needle groove disperse ultrasound wave make tip needle easily see . The sample take insert specially design needle area interest EUS guidance . Inside needle removable stylet round bevel tip facilitate passage needle tissue . The usual practice stylet extract needle pass optimum position within tissue re-inserted pas . However , recent prospective trial 111 patient , publish abstract form , find approach associate significant reduction proportion adequate sample compare stylet remove pass needle . Although significant difference diagnostic yield two group study raise issue stylet leave place detriment tissue sample , ultimately , may reduce diagnostic yield increase number pass need obtain satisfactory sample . One limitation study include heterogenous patient population . Yields EUS-FNA vary considerably depend type tissue biopsied . The second limitation consecutive patient randomize stylet remove versus stylet remove time FNA . There control group compare two group . An improvement study design would patient control group . Successive pass FNA needle increase bloodiness sample , randomization order group do help eliminate potential bias . It clear current publish literature remove stylet increase cellularity sample . However , increased cellularity may result contamination GI tract FNA needle need pas order get extra-luminal sample . Blood traumatic FNA also lead increased cellularity compromise diagnostic accuracy . Diagnostic yield depend adequacy sample enough cell lesion interpret . A preliminary result base air dry slide often lead few FNA pass diagnosis make . If possible , cell block preparation make washing EUS-FNA needle . No study examine diagnostic accuracy two type sample use EUS-FNA needle without stylet within patient . Objectives : To determine diagnostic yield EUS-FNA increase stylet remove FNA needle compare leave place .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Method : All patient refer EUS also likely require FNA screen study eligibility way inclusion exclusion criterion . After informed consent obtain patient randomized 2 different group random number generation 1 . Stylet FNA first , Stylet FNA second 2 . Stylet FNA first , Stylet FNA second As method tissue sample use patient effectively act control . In patient randomize first group stylet leave place within needle first three pass needle area sample . A new 22 gauge EUS FNA use obtain FNA stylet . In patient randomized second group 22 gauge EUS FNA needle stylet use first three pass . A new needle stylet subsequently use sampling . Three pass do FNA biopsy . For patient sample adequacy , number bloody pass number pass require obtain adequate sample record cytopathology technician . Each tissue sample prepare analysed experienced on-site cytopathology staff , blind group allocation respective patient . A positive negative diagnosis record final cytology result available . At end study period comparison two group make relation parameter outline . Statistical Analysis : Endpoints : The primary endpoint study number sample positive diagnosis group . Secondary end-points number bloody pass , sample adequacy number pass need obtain adequate sample . Sample size calculation : The outcome represent proportion FNA sample positive diagnosis . The effect size stylet FNA stylet FNA expect 30 % . This significance level p= 0.05 80 % power . The number patient arm therefore 36 . Description methodology All patient refer pancreatic EUS likely require FNA identify screen eligibility entry study accord inclusion exclusion criterion . Those patient see office prior EUS appointment invite enter study research nurse research assistant involve procedure . They provide write verbal information study prior make decision . For patient refer directly EUS-FNA another physician see office beforehand write invitation enter study send advance . This provide detailed information research proposal well helpline number patient use contact one study co-ordinators advice . A follow phone call patient make study co-ordinator attend EUS ; initial contact letter outline call make , . If patient elect enter study inform consent obtain prior randomization . Summary procedure In patient randomize first group , intravenous sedation , linear endoscopic ultrasound examination perform . The pancreatic mass identify endoscopic ultrasound use 22 gauge EUS FNA needle stylet use first pas . The stylet withdrawn 10cc suction apply FNA needle . A sample obtain move needle lesion minimum 15 time . The sample collect cytopathology . The stylet replace needle another pas perform technique . Three pass do FNA biopsy . A new 22 gauge EUS FNA use obtain FNA stylet technique outline . In patient randomized second group , intravenous sedation linear endoscopic ultrasound examination perform . The pancreatic mass identify endoscopic ultrasound use 22 gauge EUS FNA needle stylet use first pas . The stylet withdrawn 10cc suction apply FNA needle . A sample obtain move needle lesion minimum 15 time . The sample collect cytopathology . The stylet replace needle loaded position , stylet remove prior start another pas perform technique . Three pass do FNA biopsy . Adverse event potentially occur include oversedation ( 1:500 ) , pancreatitis ( 1:1000 ) , perforation ( 1:5000 ) , bleed ( extremely rare one report case press ) For patient sample adequacy , number bloody pass number pass require obtain adequate sample record cytopathology technician . Each tissue sample prepare analysed experienced on-site cytopathology staff , blind group allocation respective patient . A positive negative diagnosis record final cytology result available . At end study period comparison two group make relation parameter outline . Follow-up : Within one day , patient contact determine adverse event occur .</detailed_description>
