	<brief_summary>Pilonidal disease , chronic infection involve skin subcutaneous tissue along sacrococcygeal area ( natal cleft ) common disease affect mostly young adult male make majority military workforce . Surgical treatment option pilonidal disease vary widely invasive ( e.g . wide open excision ) minimally invasive procedure ( e.g . removal line sinus tract use minimal excision ) well popular treatment involve myocutaneous skin flap ( Limberg flap Z-plasty ) . All surgical procedure associate vary degree early late recurrence rate ; however , current , popular procedure treatment pilonidal disease involve wide open excision . A recent advancement minimally invasive surgical technique pilonidal disease involve use Keyes trephine ( 2-to-9 mm diameter biopsy instrument ) excise individual pit drain cyst cavity . Although procedure proven effective pilonidal disease overall low early recurrence rate , clinical trial perform rate procedure minimal excision current , common procedure wide open excision . A recent report suggest recurrence rate pilonidal disease minimal excision may comparable wide excision . Furthermore , report also suggest minimally invasive procedure perform minimal ( possibly local ) anesthesia , less post-operative pain medication , may involve short convalescence time patient . In order compare early recurrence rate pilonidal disease overall patient satisfaction procedure involve minimal wide open excision , propose perform prospective , randomized clinical trial compare two surgical procedure . Randomly assign patient undergo either 1 ) wide excision pilonidal-diseased tissue ( e.g . pit , cavity , sinus tract ) , include surround rim normal tissue leave open heal , 2 ) minimal excision line sinus tract use vary size trephine . Overall patient satisfaction evaluate amount analgesic use procedure , number dressing change , length convalescence , overall patient tolerance procedure , intra- post-operatively . In addition , vary data point collect use quality life survey visual analog pain scale analyze overall patient satisfaction . Patients follow period two year follow surgery evaluate early recurrence pilonidal disease .</brief_summary>
