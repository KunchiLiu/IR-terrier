	<criteria>participant confirm diagnosis CDI define : a. diarrhea , define passage 3 loose stool 24 few hour , AND b . A positive test toxigenic C. difficile stool collect 7 day study infusion . participant must receive SOC therapy CDI . SOC therapy define receipt oral metronidazole , oral vancomycin , IV metronidazole concurrent oral vancomycin , oral fidaxomicin , oral fidaxomicin concurrent IV metronidazole . participant highly unlikely become pregnant impregnate partner since meet least one follow criterion : . A female participant reproductive potential eligible without require use contraception . A female participant reproductive potential define : one either ( 1 ) reach natural menopause ( defined 6 month spontaneous amenorrhea serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level postmenopausal range determine local laboratory , 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ) ; ( 2 ) 6 week post surgical bilateral oophorectomy without hysterectomy ; ( 3 ) bilateral tubal ligation . Spontaneous amenorrhea include case underlie disease cause amenorrhea ( e.g . anorexia nervosa ) . b . A participant reproductive potential agrees remain abstinent use ( partner use ) 2 acceptable method birth control start enrollment 12 Week study period . Acceptable method birth control : intrauterine device ( IUD ) , diaphragm spermicide , contraceptive sponge , condom , vasectomy register marketed hormonal contraceptive contain estrogen and/or progestational agent ( include oral , subcutaneous , intrauterine , intramuscular agent ) participant legal representative must voluntarily agree participate provide write informed consent nature study fully explain . participant uncontrolled chronic diarrheal illness normal 24hour bowel movement habit 3 loose stool . participant plan surgery CDI within 24 hour . participant positive pregnancy test 48 hour infusion unwilling undergo pregnancy test premenopausal female sterilize therefore potential bear child . participant breastfeeding plan breastfeed prior completion 12week study period . A female participant plan donate ova prior completion 12week study period , male participant planning impregnate provide sperm donation prior completion 12week study period . participant previously participate study , previously receive MK3415 MK 6072 ( either alone combination ) , receive C. difficile vaccine , receive another experimental monoclonal antibody C. difficile toxin A B. participant plan donate blood and/or blood product within 6 month follow infusion . participant receive immune globulin within 6 month prior receipt infusion planning receive immune globulin prior completion 12week study period . treatment SOC therapy plan long 14 day . participant receive 24hour regimen cholestyramine , colestimide , rifaximin , nitazoxanide within 14 day prior receipt infusion plan receive medication prior completion 12week study period . participant plan take medication give decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis , loperamide ( Imodium™ ) diphenoxylate hydrochloride/atropine sulfate ( LOMOTIL™ ) , time 14 day follow infusion . Participants receive opioid medication onset diarrhea may include stable dose anticipation dose decrease cessation use . participant plan take probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii receive fecal transplant therapy , therapy demonstrate decrease CDI recurrence time follow infusion ( Day 1 ) completion 12week study period . participant receive another investigational study agent within previous 30 day , currently participate schedule participate clinical trial investigational agent 12week study period . participant expect survive 72 hour . participant condition , opinion investigator , would jeopardize safety right participant participate study , would make unlikely participant complete study , would confound result study .</criteria>
