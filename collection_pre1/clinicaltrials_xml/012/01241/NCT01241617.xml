	<brief_summary>The objective study confirm superiority test treatment group use Endo GIA stapler Duet Tissue Reinforcement System ( TRS ) current international standard care group use conventional stapler patient undergoing pulmonary lobectomy surgery , use randomize comparative study frequency intraoperative air leak .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ENDO GIA Stapler With Duet Tissue Reinforcement System ( TRS ) Used Pulmonary Resections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Air leak complication pulmonary surgical procedure include pulmonary lobectomy , segmentectomy , bullectomy , report occur 33 % 75 % case . Prolonged air leak continue 7 day report prevalence great 15 % . The presence history smoking , preoperative steroid use , emphysema , low pulmonary function , pleural adhesion , apical lung wedge resection show risk factor prolong air leak lengthen duration drain placement , increase day hospitalization , reduce patient ADL QOL . Prolonged air leak may also result serious complication , empyema . Tissue reinforcement material widely use pleural reinforcement prevent air leak lung surgery , report safe effective material body tissue reinforcement . Covidien Japan Inc. develop surgical stapler ( Endo GIA Duet TRS ) attach reinforcement material . This study investigate reinforcement effect staple line use newly develop surgical stapler attach reinforcement material .</detailed_description>
