	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate microvascular endothelial function retina lean , obese , type 2 diabetic subject compare microvascular endothelial function retina several establish marker endothelial microvascular function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Skin Retina Microvascular Endothelial Function Healthy , Insulin Resistant Type 2 Diabetic Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Insulin resistance early feature obese patient last hyperinsulinaemia normal glycaemic control impair glucose tolerance clinically manifest type 2 diabetes . Insulin resistance closely associate endothelial dysfunction many cardiovascular risk marker summarise definition metabolic syndrome . During recent year , insulin resistance development endothelial dysfunction recognize important pathogenetic driver development atherosclerosis major predictor development micro macrovascular complication like retinopathy , nephropathy , myocardial infarction stroke . Several different technology develop measurement endothelial function distinct vascular compartment like flow mediate vasodilatation brachial artery , numerous laser Doppler base technology measurement endothelial dependent microvascular blood flow response skin . Even retinal vascular morphology could easily visualize direct fundoscopy , investigation retinal endothelial function diagnostical challenge decade . During recent year , laser doppler scan retina become widely use technology measurement microvascular blood flow retina . Recently new stimulation technology investigation endothelial function retina develop validate . Application flicker light retina increase retinal blood flow stimulation endothelial nitric oxide ( NO ) release , laser Doppler scan retina flicker light application could use investigation microvascular endothelial function eye . For assess stage retinopathy retinal image 45Â° ( papilla-centered ) perform use digital non-mydriatic fundus camera ( Kowa Nonmyd 5 ) . The image evaluate respect diabetic hypertensive retinopathy standardize method . Also equivalent arteriolar venous diameter retinal vessel measure arterio-venous ratio calculate .</detailed_description>
