	<brief_title>Study Effect Vaginal ph Acidification Vaginal Misoprostol Its Efficacy Induction Midtrimester Abortion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>100 Pregnant woman , mid-trimester , medical indication termination pregnancy approach participate study Methods : - 1 . A formal consent woman study full notification explanation method , importance study possible unwanted effect . 2 . During pre-selection visit , exclusion inclusion criterion apply . Baseline investigation ; Blood sugar , Serum Glutamate Oxaloacetate Transaminase ( SGOT ) , Serum Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase ( SGPT ) , S. Creatinine , Complete Blood Count ( C.B.C . ) Coagulation profile ( PTT , serum fibrinogen level ) do . 3 . Following admission , patient undergo complete clinical examination detail medical history obtain . Each patient Case Record Form ( CRF ) follow data record . - Patient initial . - Patient number ( accord randomization schedule ) . - Age , height , weight , - Known allergy . - Past medical surgical history ( longer present ) . - Medications take within last 4 week discontinue . - Concomitant illness . - Concomitant medication discontinue . - Clinical examination : include full gynaecologic assessment include vaginal speculum examination record vaginal cervical condition . 4 . The vaginal Ph measure use Universal indicator paper pH ( 1-14 ) digital vaginal examination . Through speculum examination , indicator hold artery forceps vaginal wall-high vagina-until becomes wet . Color change strip immediately compare colorimetric scale measurement record . Patients divide 2 group : - - Group 1 : -those Ph &lt; 5 . ( n=50 ) . - Group 2 : -those Ph &gt; or=5 . ( n=50 ) . 5 . Each group subdivide another two group : - - Group 1A ( n=25 ) . - Group 1B ( n=25 ) . - Group 2A ( n=25 ) . - Group 2B ( n=25 ) . 6 . All woman group 1A group 2A receive intravaginal misoprostol tablet moisten 3 ml 5 % acetic acid , woman group 1B group 2B receive intravaginal misoprostol tablet moisten water , 400 microgram every 4 hour maximum 5 dos within 24 hour . If patient adequate uterine contraction , regimen repeat follow 24 hour , response achieve , consider failure therapy , another method use like large dos oxytocin cervical dilatation foley 's catheter no.16 . 7. assessment though occurrence uterine contraction progress abortion induction -termination interval primary outcome . 8 . The investigator supervise application medication dose dose . Subjects withdraw study onset spontaneous labor</detailed_description>
