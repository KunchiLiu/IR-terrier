	<brief_summary>Earlier investigator determine safety feasibility tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell therapeutic adjuvant mesothelioma patient . Because pre-clinical data mouse show well result obtain regulatory T cell deplete use low-dosis cyclophosphamide , ten patient respond chemotherapy select DC-treatment combination Endoxan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dendritic Cell-based Immunotherapy Combined With Low-dose Cyclophosphamide Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently satisfactory low-toxicity treatment patient mesothelioma ( MM ) . Based study type cancer humans beneficial effect obtain , base pre-clinical data mouse model MM , lead introduction DC-immunotherapy human MM 2005 . A beneficial effect immunotherapy MM patient without major side effect find , however , research show DC immunotherapy might improve . The objective propose phase study : - To define safety toxicity low dose CTX combination MesoCancerVac patient MM . - To determine vaccination low dose CTX combination MesoCancerVac result detectable immune response skin DTH reaction MM crude antigen KLH vitro laboratory analysis . - To observe document anti-cancer activity laboratory evaluation ( e.g . decrease Tregs , increase CTLs use 51Cr release IFN-gamma ELISPOT ) - To observe document anti-cancer activity clinical evaluation ( e.g . CT scan )</detailed_description>
