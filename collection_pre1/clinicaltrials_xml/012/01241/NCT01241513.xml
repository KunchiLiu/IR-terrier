	<brief_summary>The main purpose study determine drug ( acetyl-cysteine ACCY ) increase amount oxygen body high altitude 11,500 foot . ACCY approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment antidote Tylenol overdoses . Other form ACCY also sell over-the-counter nutritional supplement . In study , FDA-approved form ACCY use `` off-label '' ( mean way approve FDA ) . This study conduct researcher United States Army Research Institute Environmental Medicine ( USARIEM ) . The study take place Altitude Chamber locate basement USARIEM . A total approximately 30 volunteer ( men woman , military civilian ) take part study . They expect study minimum hour day two week . The investigator hypothesize ACCY improve ventilation oxygenation altitude .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study determine modulate reduction/oxidation ( redox ) status temporary increase blood ratio reduced-to-oxidized glutathione ( i.e. , GSH/GSSG ) increase carotid body chemosensitivity thus increase ventilation arterial oxygen saturation ( SaO2 ) 32 hour hypobaric hypoxia exposure 3500 ( 11,500 foot ) . To end , study use FDA-approved oral suspension form acetylcysteine ( ACCY ) modulate blood redox status control condition Hypobaric Chamber Facility USARIEM . Up 30 healthy , active-duty military personnel civilian local area recruit . Two independent treatment group ( placebo ACCY ; 15 group ) assess sea level altitude use between-group experimental design . The two group match closely possible age , ventilation , fitness , gender prior treatment assignment . Neither staff volunteer know treatment receive group study complete . Included men woman : 18 39 year old , bear altitude 2100 ( 7000 foot ) , take medication interfere oxygen delivery transport ( include sedative , sleep aid , tranquilizer medication depresses ventilation , diuretic , alpha beta blocker ) ; evidence physical , mental , and/or medical condition would make propose study relatively hazardous . All volunteer participate two-week long study period multiple standardized assessment include rest ( e.g. , rest ventilation , SaO2 , questionnaires ) , sleep ( e.g. , heart rate , SaO2 ) exercise ( e.g. , steady-state time-trial performance , SaO2 ) measurement . The potential risk test volunteer include risk associate hypobaric hypoxia exposure ( e.g. , acute mountain sickness [ AMS ; headache , nausea , insomnia ] ) associate exercise ( e.g. , acute musculoskeletal strain sprain , blister ) . The investigator aware study report problem oral administration ACCY dose duration use present study . There direct benefit volunteer , except knowledge well perform altitude test participate . If use ACCY prof effective altitude , soldier deploy altitude future may mean beneficially increase ventilation SaO2 manner similar experience natural altitude acclimatization .</detailed_description>
