	<brief_summary>The standard care therapy DLBCL relapse set RICE plan patient proceed transplant . This protocol add Revlimid first 7 day RICE therapy transplant maintenance . To improve outcome survival . Hypothesis combine lenalidomide standard care ( RICE ) may increase overall response rate thus increase number patient able proceed autologous stem cell transplant . This turn may translate improve overall survival progression free survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Lenalidomide Combination With RICE With Lenalidomide Maintenance Post-Auto Transplant DLBCL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 3-Stage , phase I/II , single-arm , open-label study . The first second stage study assess safety efficacy lenalidomide , rituximab , Ifosfamide , etoposide , carboplatin ( RICER ) treatment DLBCL patient first relapse . The third stage study assess safety efficacy post-ASCT lenalidomide maintenance patient DLBC . In stage I study , escalate dos lenalidomide ( 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 mg daily x 7 day Days 1-7 ) along RICE therapy give cohort subject standard 3+3 design ( see section 5.4.2 dose escalation schema ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . In stage II , subject give RICE plus MTD lenalidomide . The start dose lenalidomide Stage II modify reduce renal function outline Section 5.4.2 . In stage I stage II , subject stable disease progression disease 2 cycle RICER take study . Subjects achieve &gt; PR 2 cycle RICER receive third cycle follow stem cell collection ASCT . Each cycle 14 day . Delays initiate new cycle allow 14 day Stages I II . The planned number cycle 3 . After second cycle , restaging PET CT scan perform . Patients progressive disease remove study , chemosensitive patient ( CR/Cru PR ) proceed third cycle RICER . Stem cell collection complete within 10-14 day third cycle RICER . HDCMT-autoSCT perform patient recovers stem cell collection toxicity . HDCMT ( high dose chemotherapy ) follow autologous stem cell transplant involve administration chemotherapy BEAM ( BCNU , Etoposide , Ara-C , Melphalan ) follow infusion autologous stem cell . Involved-field radiation sit bulky disease allow prior HDCMT-SCT . Stage III , recovery aSCT , exceed 90 day eligible subject receive lenalidomide maintenance therapy ( po daily Days 1-21 q28 day ) 1 year . Delays initiate new cycle 28 day allow Stage III . Subjects follow progression- free survival overall survival 2 year . The start dose lenalidomide maintenance treatment base calculated creatinine clearance within 28 day prior start lenalidomide maintenance</detailed_description>
