	<brief_summary>High joint load walk link cartilage degradation . Biomarkers , find blood urine , protein fragment release cartilage degradation characteristic OA . They potential enable direct immediate disease state monitoring identification early cartilage change . Little known association biomarkers joint load exercise aim reduce joint load change biomarker level , thus reduce risk OA progression . This study provide novel information relationship guide future intervention study . The investigator hypothesize certain biomarkers highly correlate joint load walking level biomarkers blood urine decrease follow exercise intervention aim cartilage unload .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants test twice ( baseline 11 week later ) undergo gait strength analysis blind assessor , complete self-report questionnaire , blood urine sample draw . Participants randomize either : ( ) exercise ; ( ii ) usual care ( additional treatment ) . Those exercise group complete 10-weeks strengthen target low limb muscle . Once weekly , consult study physiotherapist ( MAH ) UBC ensure proper performance safe progression exercise . Participants give cuff weight resistance band complete exercise home five time per week . Exercise compliance monitor use log book . All participant encourage maintain usual treatment regimen ( except exercise complete exercise group ) , document unexpected alteration medication change physician visit .</detailed_description>
