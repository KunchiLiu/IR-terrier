	<brief_summary>The primary objective study compare overall survival ( OS ) patient receive ON 01910.Na + best supportive care ( BSC ) OS patient receive BSC population patient myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) excess blast ( 5 % 30 % bone marrow blast ) fail azacitidine decitabine treatment . This patient population available therapy short life expectancy ( approximately 4 month ) . The high level bone marrow activity ON 01910.Na document Phase 1 2 study potential delay substantially transition MDS Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) , significant severe complication , shorten survival MDS patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Study ON 01910.Na Refractory Myelodysplastic Syndrome Patients With Excess Blasts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III open-label , randomize , control , multicenter study ( 50 center ) . Approximately 270 patient MDS classify RAEB-1 RAEB-2 use WHO classification RAEB-t chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) use FAB classification fail , become intolerant , progressed treatment 5-azacitidine decitabine administer past 2 year , randomize 2:1 ratio follow 2 treatment regimen : - Best Supportive Care ( BSC ) + ON 01910.Na 1800 mg/24 hr administer 72-hr continuous intravenous ( CIV ) infusion Days 1 , 2 , 3 2-week cycle ( N = approximately 180 patient ) - BSC ( N = approximately 90 patient ) . Patients stratify entry bone marrow ( BM ) blast ( 5 % 19 % vs. 20 % 30 % ) . After complete first eight 2-week cycle ( i.e. , 16 week treatment ) , frequency 72-hr CIV infusion decrease administration Days 1 , 2 , 3 4-week cycle . Patients remain treated study 2006 International Working Group ( IWG ) progression criterion meet ( i.e. , 50 % increase BM blast worsen cytopenia ) death cause , whichever come first . Patients progress Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) study offer either standard treatment AML enrollment appropriate investigational study eligible . These treatment start end date document patient survival time document randomized patient . Cross-over BSC patient ON 01910.Na progression allow . However , patient BSC-only group allow , medically justified , access low-dose cytarabine 20 mg/m2 subcutaneously ( SC ) daily first consecutive 14 day 28-day cycle , 4 cycle , progression unacceptable toxicity develop . Low-dose cytarabine delay need recovery blood count . All study participant allow , medically justified , access RBC platelet transfusion growth factor ( erythropoietin , Filgrastim [ G-CSF ] ) . Hydroxyurea allow manage blastic crisis hyperleukocytosis patient transition leukemia .</detailed_description>
