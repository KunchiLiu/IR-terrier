	<brief_summary>Rationale : Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli ( ETEC ) bacteria adhere mucosa proximal intestine . There produce toxin present local relevant challenge intestine . This propose give indication general resistance and/or local resistance intestine . The sequel event mucosal inflammation characterize study . In addition evaluate effect probiotic compare infection symptom measure faecal weight mucus faeces . Objective : The main objective study investigate effect probiotic sequel ETEC administration intestinal permeability , inflammation clinical sign total faecal output , relative faecal dry weight mucin excretion faeces . In addition , sequel mucosal inflammation characterize biomarkers search .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study population : 36 Healthy male volunteer ; age &gt; = 21 &lt; = 40 year . Intervention : One group receive twice daily two sachet contain 450 billion live freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria per sachet group receive twice daily two placebo sachet . Study design : The study design randomize , parallel , placebo-controlled , double-blind study . Study substance ( probiotic ) placebo give 4 week . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study parameter percent change faecal dry weight total faecal output probiotic group placebo group . In addition , intestinal permeability , inflammation clinical symptom evaluate . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : In study healthy male volunteer challenge attenuated ETEC strain three week either probiotic placebo . This infection lead mild traveller 's diarrhoea subject approximately three day maximally . Sequels infection effect commercially available probiotic compare placebo follow . The subject therefore collect faeces several day , record defecation pattern gastro-intestinal complaint four week , undergo physical examination five venapunctions , visit facility total 8 day ( exclude two pre-study visit ) . The oral administration probiotic healthy population associate risk .</detailed_description>
