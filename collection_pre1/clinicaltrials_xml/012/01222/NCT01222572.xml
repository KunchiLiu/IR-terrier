	<brief_summary>In research study investigator look high dose stereotactic radiation boost give safely . Because stereotactic radiation precise , investigator test whether use increase dose primary tumor without significantly increase side effect participant experience ; goal improve likelihood kill tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Boost Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives Phase I : Determination MTD dose-limiting toxicity stereotactic boost chemoradiotherapy stage II/III non-small cell lung cancer . Phase II : Two-year local control rate Secondary Objectives - To evaluate safety tolerability stereotactic boost chemoradiotherapy . - To determine 2-year overall survival . - To determine 2-year disease-free survival . - To determine 2-year regional control rate . - To characterize change pulmonary function test first 2 year chemoradiotherapy . Statistical Design The Phase I study follow standard 3+3 dose escalation design . Three dose level evaluate . The DLT observation period 7-week chemoradiotherapy period subsequent 8-week recovery period . To good study toxicity MTD stereotactic boost , 10 patient expansion cohort.The primary endpoint phase II portion study two-year local failure rate protocol treatment . Local failure define biopsy-proven recurrent disease , biopsy attainable , increase FDG-avidity PET-CT 2 consecutive scan least 1 month apart . Based prior study , 2-year local failure rate 15 % would worthy study , 2-year local failure rate 35 % would justify utilization treatment . With 32 eligible patient study , treatment deem promising least 25 patient free local failure 2 year . Using design , 8 % probability declare treatment worthy study true 2-year local failure rate 35 % , 90 % probability declare treatment worthy study true 2-year local failure rate 15 % use one-sided one-sample exact binomial test .</detailed_description>
