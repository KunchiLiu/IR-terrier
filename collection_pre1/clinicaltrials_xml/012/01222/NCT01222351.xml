	<brief_summary>The overall goal project establish validate biomarkers associate risk progression late onset Alzheimer 's disease , mild cognitive impairment cognitive decline . The investigator use baseline longitudinal measurement plasma amyloid beta-40 amyloid beta-42 investigate risk develop mild cognitive impairment late onset Alzheimer 's disease , well rate cognitive decline Alzheimer 's disease progression . Participants select basis change plasma amyloid beta level prior assessment interval . The purpose study examine whether brain amyloid plaque load , measure positron emission tomography x-ray computed tomography brain image use Florbetaben Bayer , vary function change plasma level amyloid beta . The drive hypothesis study high plasma level amyloid beta antecedent indicator increase risk cognitive decline , mild cognitive impairment , incident late onset Alzheimer 's disease , decline plasma level amyloid beta associate onset cognitive decline . Further , high plasma level amyloid beta relate increased level amyloid beta brain measure positron emission tomography positivity , specific pattern positron emission tomography positivity decline plasma amyloid beta time associate onset cognitive decline associate late onset Alzheimer 's disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project sub-study Washington Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project , multidisciplinary , epidemiological study Alzheimer 's disease relate neurodegenerative disorder . We obtain positron emission tomography scan simultaneous x-ray compute tomography scan use Florbetaben Bayer selection ongoing participant select basis change plasma level amyloid beta time . Approximately 200 participant receive scan begin 2009 2010-2012 assessment wave 2014-2015 assessment wave . Our intention examine whether uptake Florbetaben brain varies function previous history change plasma level amyloid beta order validate plasma amyloid beta viable biomarker late onset Alzheimer 's disease .</detailed_description>
