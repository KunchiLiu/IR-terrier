	<brief_summary>Granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) frequently use among patient cancer include haematological malignancy . Filgrastim recombinant human CSF whose biological activity similar endogenous G-CSF . In treatment chemotherapy-induced neutropenia patient various type cancer CSFs significantly reduce time neutrophil recovery length hospitalization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSFs ) stimulate proliferation differentiation myeloid progenitor cell , improve cell survival affect end-cell function , bind G-CSF receptor present cell neutrophilic granulocyte lineage . Filgrastim ( recombinant G-CSF ) frequently use among patient cancer include haematological malignancy . In-vivo study study healthy people show SC administration CSF result low peak prolong stable level G-CSF compare Intravenous ( IV ) administration , similar high neutrophil count . It safe assume IV administration G-CSFs would comfortable patient hospitalize , especially chemotherapy patient central catheter thrombocytopenic . However , necessary ensure effect obtain method administration . Objectives : To compare time neutropenia resolution Intravenous ( IV ) versus Subcutaneous ( SC ) filgrastim administration among patient acute leukemia , lymphoma multiple myeloma hospital . Secondarily , investigator aim assess comparative rate infection , adverse effect patient ' satisfaction . Methods : The investigator plan randomize controlled trial comparing effect IV versus SC filgrastim ( NeupogenÂ® ) give per clinical indication neutrophil count hospitalize patient . The investigator include patient hospitalized haemato-oncology ward start filgrastim treatment chemotherapy-induced neutropenia . The investigator compare SC vs. IV filgrastim , give single daily dose 5 mcg/kg ( round 300 mcg 480 mcg ) . No blinding use . Patients approach obtain informed consent randomize mode filgrastim administration decision administer drug make . Patients cross alternative study arm subsequent chemotherapy course , filgrastim clinically indicate . Outcomes : Primary efficacy : Time stable neutrophil recovery , define number day start filgrastim ( day 1 ) neutrophil count reach &gt; 500/mcL 3 consecutive day . Primary safety : 30-day mortality document infection ( CDI , MDI , bacteremia probable/ proven IFI , see definition ) within chemotherapy course ( neutrophil recovery ) . Secondary outcome include rate infection , fever day , hospital stay , patient 's satisfaction , clinical endpoint adverse event . The investigator assess distribution pattern time neutrophil recovery compare group use Student 's t-test Mann-Whitney U test , appropriate . The investigator construct Kaplan-Meier curve time neutrophil recovery compare treatment arm use two-tailed log rank test . Dichotomous outcome compare use chi-square test . A sample 96 patient AML ( 48 group ) calculate demonstrate equivalence allow 2-day difference treatment arm ( power 90 % , alpha 0.05 ) . Interim analysis stop rule : We conduct interim analysis safety assessment every 50 patient recruit . Stopping rule base primary safety outcome ( p &lt; 0.1 stop ) death alone ( p &lt; 0.2 stop ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients hospitalize haematooncology ward start filgrastim treatment chemotherapyinduced neutropenia .
