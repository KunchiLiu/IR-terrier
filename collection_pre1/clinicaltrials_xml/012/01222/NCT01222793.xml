	<brief_summary>Background : - Although second-generation antipsychotic medication fewer serious side effect complication first-generation one , strongly associate weight gain reason yet unknown . Comparing effect second-generation antipsychotic high weight-gain liability ( HWGL ) low weight-gain liability ( LWGL ) antipsychotic may provide information medication best suit different individual . Researchers interested study people take various antipsychotic compare control regard food crave eat behavior . This knowledge help guide practitioner advise patient weight-gain effect medication . Objectives : - To examine eat behavior food crave patient schizophrenia take HWGL antipsychotic compare take LWGL antipsychotic healthy control take antipsychotic . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 45 year age diagnose schizophrenia relate disorder , body mass index 25 29.9 , never eat disorder . - Healthy individual 18 45 year age body mass index 25 29.9 never eat disorder . Design : - This study involve initial screen visit four study visit . - Participants screen medical history physical examination , well questionnaires stress level , food craving , smoking , exercise , eat habit ; taste test ; saliva collection ( measure stress hormone ) . - Visit 2 : Participants optional overnight stay , provide blood sample breakfast beverage answer question tiredness , anxiety , hunger , alertness 1.5 hour session . Visit 3 : Participants optional overnight stay light breakfast , follow blood draw question hunger food craving . Visit 4 : Participants optional overnight stay , follow question food preference .

	<detailed_description>Objective Some second-generation antipsychotic , olanzapine clozapine , seem especially prone induce metabolic complication substantial increase weight . The mechanisms side effect unknown , may include antagonism histamine H1 receptor . We refer olanzapine clozapine antipsychotic high weight-gain liability ( HWGL ) . The primary aim project examine eat food crave patient schizophrenia take HWGL antipsychotic compare take LWGL antipsychotic ( mid- high-potency first-generation antipsychotic , aripiprazole , ziparasidone ) compare healthy control take antipsychotic . The antipsychotic classify LWGL group appreciable H1 receptor antagonism . We exclude participant take antipsychotic middle degree H1 receptor antagonism ( e.g . quetiapine ) . This study help u understand people schizophrenia differ control eat food craving , well effect different class antipsychotic . This knowledge help guide practitioner advise patient weight-gain effect medication . For example , find participant HWGL antipsychotic tend crave high-fat food , practitioner work patient anticipate mitigate side effect . Study population . The study population in- outpatient DSM-IV diagnosis schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder stabilize either olanzapine clozapine ( HWGL antipsychotic ) ( N=20 ) , aripiprazole , ziprasidone , first-generation antipsychotic ( LWGL antipsychotic ) ( n=20 ) , normal control ( people Axis I psychiatric disorder take antipsychotic medication ) ( n=20 ) , total 60 participant . All participant age 18 45 year consider overweight ( BMI great equal 25 less equal 29.9 kg/m ( SqrRoot ) ) . The pediatric population exclude rule certain hormonal effect ( e.g . puberty ) eat behavior . A BMI range encompass participant overweight select maximize recruitment minimize confound effect BMI eat behavior . Exclusion criterion include weight-related condition current dietary restriction . Experimental design method . In between-subjects design , three study group compare term four domain eat behavior : ( 1 ) food craving , ( 2 ) satiety signal , ( 3 ) meal size ( satiation ) , ( 4 ) food preference . Assessments occur five study visit ( include initial visit consent screen ) . Outcome measure : Primary outcome measure include preload-test meal paradigm ( satiety ) , meal size perception satiation , food preference , food craving , gustatory functioning . Secondary measure include : Weight Eating Assessment questionnaire , Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire ( RPAQ ) , State Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) , Exercise Motivations Inventory ( EMI ) , Childhood Trauma Questionnaire , Tobacco Craving Questionnaire-Short Form ( TCQ-SF ) , Fagerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence ( FTND ) , BMI , hip/waist measurement , fast blood work : CBC , CMP14 , lipid panel , leptin , ghrelin , adiponectin , thyroid panel .</detailed_description>
