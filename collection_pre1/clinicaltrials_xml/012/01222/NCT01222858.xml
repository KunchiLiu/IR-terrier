The problem , however , physician currently limit option referral . The challenge field develop program physician refer overweight/obese patient . The program must low cost , easily accessible , must promote adherence weight loss regimen consequently improve weight loss outcome . The goal Challenge Grant application develop test innovative web-based program would provide accessible effective approach enhance adherence clinical recommendation weight loss .

Periodic report patient ' progress also send refer physician . We test program randomize trial 250 patient referred physician randomly assign either Internet Education ( Control ) ( N=125 ) Innovative Technology program ( N=125 ) . Participants group receive 12 week Internet program either basic weight loss education Innovative Technology program weigh start end 3 month program 3 month follow-up . The primary hypothesis patient assign Innovative Technology program achieve large average weight loss control group 12-week program . Secondary hypothesis Innovative technology group adhere well 12-weeks ( assessed log-ins web site self-reported change diet activity ) achieve good weight loss 6 month control group . The propose project address significant problem obesity use innovative technology improve adherence behavioral weight loss strategy . If program effective , would provide outstanding resource physician use patient thus would tremendous clinical impact .</detailed_description>
