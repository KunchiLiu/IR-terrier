	<brief_summary>Background : - Cocaine addiction often difficult treat , particularly exposure others use cocaine picture cocaine may evoke cocaine crave lead person resume cocaine use quit . Breaking link cocaine craving might improve treatment cocaine addiction . Research suggest repetitive pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) apply skull change nerve cell fire brain . rTMS recently approve treatment depression , study way reduce drug craving . However , small study look effect rTMS cocaine craving , research need whether effective reduce cocaine craving use individual currently use cocaine regular basis . Objectives : - To determine whether transcranial magnetic stimulation lower crave cocaine give connection cocaine-related image . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age use cocaine least 2 year currently use least 3 time per week . Design : - This study involve initial screen visit , two brain imaging session , five rTMS session , two follow-up visit . - Participants screen medical history , physical examination , urine sample , question drug use history previous effort quit , test breath alcohol nicotine level . - Participants two magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan session : one baseline scan session start rTMS session second scan session last rTMS session . Part scan session involve functional MRI ( fMRI ) scan . During fMRI scan , participant look picture related cocaine use picture related cocaine use . Participants also perform simple decision task scan . - Participants five rTMS session , one per day 5 day row . Each session last 1 2 hour . Participants either real sham ( simulate ) rTMS look picture may may relate cocaine use , also perform simple decision task one give MRI scan . The decision whether participant get real sham rTMS make chance . Neither participant investigator know type participant get . - Participants two follow-up visit one two week last rTMS session . At visit check cocaine substance use possible side-effects rTMS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Cocaine Craving</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective : Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) provide non-invasive mean alter brain neural activity . This pilot study test whether 5 day rTMS reduces cue-induced cocaine crave cocaine use cocaine user . Hypothesis : We predict active rTMS significantly low crave cocaine compare sham rTMS . Study population : Thirty healthy adult cocaine user ( least 2 year , currently average least 3 time weekly ) major psychiatric disorder except nicotine dependence ( DSM IV criterion ) recruit community . Design : Following baseline phase evaluate subject characteristic , subject randomly assign receive 5 day active sham rTMS treatment . rTMS 1 Hz strength 120 % motor threshold applied dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) use H-coil ( HADD version ) contain helmet , begin 1 second presentation cocaine-associated visual cue last 30 second . Brain site localization use computerize navigation system base structural MRI scan obtain first session . Each treatment session ( last around 31 minute ) consist 54 trial ( cue presentation ) : 36 cocaine-associated cue 9 non-drug-associated positive neutral cue . No rTMS administer non-cocaine-associated cue . Subjects return follow-up assessment one two week final rTMS session . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure cocaine crave assess 100-mm visual analog scale every TMS treatment one- two week follow-up . Secondary outcome measure 14-item Cocaine Craving Questionnaire , self-reported cocaine use , urine drug test rTMS session follow-up visit , change regional brain response cocaine-associated visual cue assess fMRI do 5 rTMS session . Benefits : There direct benefit individual subject . The future benefit society may development good method treatment cocaine addiction . Risks : The primary risk rTMS transient headache , scalp discomfort , decrease spatial recognition memory , hear loss ( minimize wear ear plug ) . Seizures rare rTMS administer within accept safety guideline individual increase risk seizure exclude . The risk induce manic episode minimize exclude individual history non-drug-induced mania/hypomania .</detailed_description>
