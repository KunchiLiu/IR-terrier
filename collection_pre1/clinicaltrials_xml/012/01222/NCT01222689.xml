	<brief_title>Selumetinib Erlotinib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : l. To assess overall survival ( measured median survival proportion patient alive 24 week ) patient advanced pancreatic cancer receive one prior line systemic therapy treat combination AZD6244 ( selumetinib ) erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Progression-free survival ( median progression-free survival [ PFS ] proportion patient PFS 12 24 week ) . II . Cancer antigen ( CA ) 19-9 biomarker response ( defined 50 % decline serum CA19-9 level baseline patient &gt; 2 x upper limit normal [ ULN ] CA19-9 measurement ) . III . Objective radiographic response Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . IV . Safety toxicity profile combination AZ6244 erlotinib . OUTLINE : Patients receive selumetinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) erlotinib hydrochloride PO QD day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2-3 month .</detailed_description>
