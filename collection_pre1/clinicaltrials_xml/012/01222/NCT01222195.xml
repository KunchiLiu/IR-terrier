	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Darbepoetin Low-Intermediate Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lenalidomide design change immune system may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may decrease prevent growth cancer cell . Darbepoetin alfa design stimulate production red blood cell . If find eligible take part study , take lenalidomide day mouth Days 1-21 . On Days 22-28 , take lenalidomide . Swallow lenalidomide capsule whole water time day . Do break , chew open capsule . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next schedule day ( NOT take double regular dose make miss dose ) . Due uncertain amount re-absorption lenalidomide , re-dose lenalidomide vomit pill . Every 28 day call study `` cycle '' . Since lenalidomide may cause blood clot , take aspirin every day , mouth , unless platelet count low . Darbepoetin alfa give needle skin ( subcutaneously ) every 2 week . You give drug diary . In diary , record take study drug side effect may . During Cycle 1 , study visit receive lenalidomide month first 3 month , every 3 month . At visit , physical exam . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Your drug diary check return bottle study drug unused drug . You receive one cycle supply lenalidomide . At end first 3 cycle , early doctor think necessary , bone marrow aspirate . If doctor think necessary , may additional bone marrow aspirate study . You may remain study long benefitting . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Once off-study , end-of-study visit . At visit , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . If woman able child , portion blood use blood pregnancy test . You contact phone 30 day take study , every 3 month . You ask side effect experience , new treatment , need blood product . The phone call take 10 minute . This investigational study . Lenalidomide FDA approve commercially available . Lenalidomide approve treatment patient transfusion-dependent anemia due low- intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndrome associate chromosome 5 abnormality without chromosome abnormality . Lenalidomide also approve combination dexamethasone treatment patient multiple myeloma receive least one prior therapy . Its use study investigational . Darbepoetin alfa approve FDA treatment low red blood cell patient cancer kidney disease . The use drug together consider investigational . Up 39 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
