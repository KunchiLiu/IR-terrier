	<brief_title>Investigating Re-Dosing With Otelixizumab Adults With Newly-Diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective phase IIa , open-label , multi-centre study ass safety , tolerability immunogenicity re-dosing 6 month 8 consecutive day series otelixizumab intravenous ( IV ) infusions 8 adult subject newly diagnose type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) . Although hoped β cell preserve effect otelixizumab long-lasting , possible effect may decline time thus T1DM subject may require re-treatment . Six month minimum time expect treatment . After baseline assessment , eligible subject receive 8 consecutive day otelixizumab infusion , give 30 minute period . Prophylaxis cytokine release syndrome AEs give . At Month 6 , follow review new medical condition , concomitant medication , lymphocyte count , Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) viral load re-dosing eligibility criterion , subject re-treated dose regimen . Subjects follow 24 month study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female , age 18 45 year . Women allow nonchildbearing potential agree use one contraception method list protocol . Diagnosis type 1 autoimmune diabetes mellitus accord ADA WHO criteria No 90 day diagnosis first dose study drug . Currently require insulin T1DM treatment , require insulin time diagnosis first dose study drug . Positive one autoantibodies typically associate T1DM : antibody glutamic acid decarboxylase ( anti‑GAD ) ; antibody protein tyrosine phosphataselike protein ( anti‑IA‑2 ) ; insulin autoantibody ( IAA ) . A subject positive insulin autoantibody ( IAA ) negative autoantibody eligible subject use insulin le 7 day total . Stimulated Cpeptide level great 0.20 nmol/L less equal 3.50 nmol/L Body mass index great 32 kg/m2 . QTc &lt; 450 millisecond ( msec ) &lt; 480msec patient Bundle Branch Block Pregnant , breastfeeding , plan become pregnant begin screen period least 14 day prior initial dose least 60 day last dose second treatment course study drug . Current prior malignancy , nonmelanoma skin cancer ( subject must fewer 5 occurrence nonmelanoma skin cancer , last occurrence must within 3 month study entry ) . Clinically significant abnormal laboratory value Screening period , due T1DM . Permitted range select laboratory value show protocol . A clinically significant abnormal value result exclusion , upon test , abnormality resolve becomes clinically insignificant . Significant and/or active disease body system likely increase risk subject interfere subject 's participation completion study . Examples significant disease include , limited , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , renal failure , emphysema , history bleed peptic ulcer , history seizure ( ) , addiction illicit drug , alcohol abuse . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) , presence hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , positive hepatitis C test result within 3 month screen Significant systemic infection 6 week first dose study drug ( e.g. , infection require hospitalisation , major surgery , IV antibiotic resolve ; infection , e.g. , bronchitis , sinusitis , localise cellulitis , candidiasis , urinary tract infection , must assess casebycase basis investigator regard whether serious enough warrant exclusion ) . History current past active tuberculosis infection latent tuberculosis infection . Further detail give protocol . A positive test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody risk factor predispose subject HIV infection . EBV viral load great = 10,000 copy per 10xe6 peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) determine quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) . If clinical suspicion subject EBV seronegative EBV PCR &lt; 10,000 copy per 10xe6 PBMCs symptom consistent infectious mononucleosis prior administration study drug , monospot test result must negative subject dose . A positive test syphilis . Had potent immunosuppressive agent ( e.g. , systemic highdose corticosteroid chronic basis , methotrexate , cyclosporine , antiTNF agent ) within 30 day first dose study drug , expect require treatment within 3 month last dose study drug . ( Intranasal , inhale , topical corticosteroid medication permit use recommended dosage . ) Used atypical antipsychotic drug ( e.g. , risperidone [ Risperdal ] , quetiapine [ Seroquel ] , clozapine [ Clozaril ] ) within 30 day first dose study drug , expect require treatment study . Received vaccine within 30 day first dose study drug , expect require vaccine dose period 30 day last dose study drug . Previously receive otelixizumab anti CD3 monoclonal antibody , e.g. , OKT3 ( muromonab Orthoclone ) , ChAglyCD3 , hOKT3γ1 ( ala ala ) , willing refrain use antibody plan duration study participation ( 18 month last dose study drug ) . Previously receive anti lymphocyte monoclonal antibody , antiCD20 , antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) , rituximab ( Rituxan ) , alemtuzumab ( Campath ) , plan use antibody plan duration study participation ( 18 month last dose study drug ) . Had investigational drug within 3 month first dose study drug plan take investigational drug within18 month last dose study drug . Have donate plasma blood within 45 day first dose study drug . Prior allergic reaction , include anaphylaxis , human , humanise , chimeric , rodent antibody . Undergone major surgical procedure within 30 day first dose study drug , plan undergo surgery within 3 month last dose study drug .</criteria>
