	<brief_summary>Background : - Neurofibromatosis type II ( NF2 ) associate tumor nerve , brain , spinal cord . Most people NF2 develop vestibular schwannomas , tumor hear balance nerve . As grow , vestibular schwannomas cause hearing loss balance problem . If grow large cause serious problem , seizure , loss eyesight , weakness , speech problem , problem sense touch . More research need NF2 researcher completely understand tumor occur make grow time . - Currently , tumor size measure magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . However , MRI scan predict fast tumor grow . By use positron emission tomography ( PET ) scanning , researcher hope able predict sudden growth spurt tumor associate NF2 develop well treatment method type cancer . Objectives : - To use magnetic resonance image positron emission tomography well understand growth brain tumor people neurofibromatosis type II . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 50 year age diagnose NF2 least three untreated intracranial tumor . Design : - This study require initial set outpatient visit NIH Clinical Center last 7 10 day . - Participants physical neurological examination blood test first visit . Participants follow image study examine tumor : - MRI scan brain - PET scan brain , combine compute tomography ( CT ) scan . The PET scan perform separate day . Different contrast agent use scan , researcher inform participant need fast follow procedure scan . - After initial imaging study , participant additional MRI scan every 6 month 2 year track tumor growth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The objective prospective observational study intracranial tumor patient neurofibromatosis type 2 ( NF2 ) gain insight use 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose ( FDG ) 3 -deoxy-3 -18F-fluorothymidine ( FLT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) predictive measure future tumor growth pattern . STUDY POPULATION : &lt; TAB &gt; Twelve patient , age 18-50 , clinical genetic diagnosis NF2 harbor least 3 unoperated intracranial tumor ( meningiomas and/or vestibular schwannomas ) participate study . DESIGN : Study participant evaluate thorough physical neurologic examination upon enrollment . This initial outpatient evaluation include contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain , FDG-PET/CT FLT-PET/CT scan . Subjects follow outpatient two year , time MRI evaluation perform every six month . OUTCOME MEASURES : Based data derive study , hope correlate FDG-PET/CT FLT-PET/CT scan metabolic activity cellular proliferation within tumor . These finding help u good forecast tumor growth senescence . These finding permit safe treatment subset tumor grow cause symptom avoid unnecessary treatment lesion remain stable ( require treatment ) patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Clinical diagnosis NF2 establish clinical criterion genetic testing . Age 18 50 . A minimum 3 intracranial tumor ( meningiomas and/or VSs ) measure = &gt; 1cm size , include : 1 . At least one unoperated VS &gt; 1 cm size AND 2 . At least one unoperated meningioma &gt; 1 cm size No pregnancy intent become pregnant , proper use contraception duration study . Normal liver enzyme : test complete within 14 day injection radiopharmaceutical ; SGOT , SGPT &lt; 5x ULN ; bilirubin le equal 2x ULN If prior radiation therapy tumor : &gt; 2 year must pass radiotherapy administration tumor must demonstrate growth radiotherapy ( signify viable tumor study present ) If prior chemotherapy : must complete chemotherapy &gt; 6 month prior enrollment allow washout chemotherapeutic agent EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Clinically unstable condition precludes serial clinical imaging evaluation ( i.e . Class 3 congestive heart failure , severe chronic renal insufficiency , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) . Contraindication MRI scanning , include pacemaker implant electrical device , brain stimulators , type dental implant , aneurysm clip ( metal clip wall large artery ) , metallic prosthesis ( include metal pin rod , heart valve , cochlear implant ) , permanent eyeliner , implanted delivery pump , shrapnel fragment Severe chronic renal insufficiency ( glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) , hepatorenal syndrome postliver transplantation .</criteria>
