	<brief_summary>Treatment multidrug-resistant TB ( MDR-TB ) 100 time expensive treatment drug-susceptible TB , require intensive clinical management prolonged time ( 18-24 month ) toxic treatment course . In prior open label study investigator show add V-5 Immunitor ( V5 ) , reduce treatment duration one month enhance 4-5 fold efficacy TB drug . Furthermore , V5 show reverse reduce liver damage cause chemotherapy . The cost V5 modest . The investigator propose conduct placebo-controlled clinical trial patient treatment refractory TB clinical benefit V5 confirm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The first-diagnosed Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ( TB ) curable first line anti-tuberculosis drug ( ATT ) 90 % case within 6 month . The treatment TB , refractory conventional ATT , require deployment second line TB drug . This represent significant challenge , particularly resource-poor country . The incidence TB Ukraine prior 1992 40 case per 100,000 people . Ten year later , TB case increase 80/100,000 , mortality double 10.2/100,000 21.6/100,000 . Drug-resistant TB common Ukraine . Isoniazid rifampicin resistance , define MDR-TB , find 44 % 32.9 % TB isolate . The first Ukrainian case HIV report 1987 . Today , Ukraine high HIV rate Eastern Europe , increase proportion dual infection . For example , 2002 prevalence TB HIV co-infection 6.3 % , 2006 least 15.5 % TB patient HIV co-infection . It clear alternative improve treatment option need . If intervention find , impact healthcare clinical management treatment-refractory TB TB-HIV patient tremendous . The significant effort direct find new drug vaccine TB . Immune-based intervention actively seek adjunct therapy conventional ATT . In early study investigator accidentally observe patient chronic hepatitis C HIV-TB give V5 together TB drug result negative sputum conversion 95 % patient within one month . This startle finding prompt study . The aim present study compare clinical benefit TB therapy combination V5 versus combination placebo ATT representative population patient poorly manageable due relapse TB , MDR-TB , TB-HIV co-infection .</detailed_description>
