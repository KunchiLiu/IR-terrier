	<detailed_description>Background : Brain tumor common solid neoplasm childhood second common group pediatric cancer . Standard therapeutic option brain tumor consist surgical resection , radiation therapy chemotherapy ; yet overall survival rate malignant brain tumor remain low . Radiation therapy play key role treatment diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) high-grade glioma ( HGG ) , thalidomide show animal model radiosensitizer . Lenalidomide , thalidomide analog antiangiogenic , cytotoxic immunomodulatory effect , evaluate treatment CNS tumor , show tolerability activity pediatric study . Objectives : To determine tolerability toxicity profile oral lenalidomide administer child newly diagnose HGG DIPG concurrent radiation dose 116 mg/m ( 2 ) /day . To evaluate long-term tolerability lenalidomide child newly-diagnosed HGG DIPG . To evaluate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) sequence noninvasive monitoring metabolic biologic change malignant brain tumor therapy . To estimate 6 month 12 month progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient population . To determine angiogenic and/or immunomodulatory biomarkers blood urine correlate toxicity disease response . To determine rate CNS metastatic disease patient treat antiangiogenic chemotherapy . To determine correlation steady state pharmacokinetics lenalidomide time progression , number type toxicity , dose limit toxicity . Eligibility : Children newly diagnose HGG DIPG , less 22 year age , prior chemotherapy radiation therapy , performance score great equal 60 % . Children HGG must inoperable incompletely resected tumor . Clinical laboratory test must within state limit . Design : There two phase therapy study , Radiation Phase Maintenance Phase . The MTD determine tolerability Radiation Phase . Eligible patient receive radiation therapy five day per week prescription dose 54-59.4 Gy , concurrent administration lenalidomide daily standard Phase I dose escalation design . At conclusion radiation therapy , two week break follow maintenance dose lenalidomide 21 day 28 day course , unacceptable toxicity , disease progression completion 24 course lenalidomide beyond radiotherapy ( unless otherwise approve PI ) . Using multi-center , standard phase I dose escalation design , total sample size study duration expect 18 30 patient 5-6 year , respectively</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : Histological diagnosis : Histological confirmation highgrade malignant glioma require . Histologic diagnosis include , limited , anaplastic astrocytoma glioblastoma multiforme . Patients DIPG exempt histologic verification typical MRI finding DIPG ( i.e . hypo isointense T1weighted imaging , hyperintense FLAIR T2weighted imaging , epicenter pons , great 50 % pons involve ) face typical clinical presentation . Inoperable tumor residual disease resection Prior therapy : No prior chemotherapy radiation therapy HGG DIPG permit . Prior chemotherapy radiation therapy treatment malignancy permit . Age : Patients must less 22 year age time diagnosis . Able swallow capsule whole Performance Score : Patients Karnofsky/Lansky score great equal 60 . Patients require special assistance due tumorrelated paralysis , bed day consider ambulatory purpose calculate performance score . Patients must able communicate symptom . Laboratory Evaluation : The follow laboratory value must assess within seven ( 7 ) day prior start therapy . Laboratory test repeat within 48 hour begin therapy significant clinical change . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,000/mcL platelet great equal 100,000/mcL total bilirubin le 1.5 time upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal creatinine ageadjusted maximum limit OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 ( 2 ) Age ( Years ) Maximum Serum Creatinine ( mg/dl ) : Less equal 5 year ; 0.8 Age great 5 , less equal 10 ; 1.0 Age great 1 , less equal 15 ; 1.2 Less 15 year age ; 1.5 Females : urine serum pregnancy test negative No overt renal , hepatic , cardiac pulmonary disease . Steroids : Newly diagnose patient may need steroid due surgery control neurologic symptom . Patients steroid postoperatively control tumorrelated edema eligible , attempts keep patient lowest dose necessary control symptom make . Patients childbearing potential : Female Subjects : Definition female childbearing potential ( FCBP ) This protocol define female childbearing potential sexually mature woman : 1 ) undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy 2 ) naturally postmenopausal ( amenorrhea follow cancer therapy rule childbearing potential ) least 24 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) . Criteria female child childbearing potential ( FCCBP ) This protocol define FCCBP female : Achieved menarche and/or breast development Tanner stage 2 great Onset fertility typically occur within 312 month menarche . Menarche vary considerably person person , thus age cut attribute . One primary tool use follow girl progress puberty Tanner stag system , describe pattern development secondary sex characteristic . Tanner stage 2 corresponds begin breast development , first visible sign puberty girl . Breast development estrogen stimulate , since ovulation occur without estrogen , Tanner stage 2 reliable marker definition fertility . Has undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy . Note : Amenorrhea follow cancer therapy rule childbearing potential Criteria female child childbearing potential ( FCNCBP ) This protocol define FCNCBP female : Who yet experience menarche breast development Tanner stage 2.

Patients significant medical illness , investigator opinion , adequately controlled appropriate therapy , would compromise patient ability tolerate therapy result inability ass toxicity . This include , limit uncontrolled intercurrent illness include ongoing active infection , cardiac disease , renal impairment psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients history Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis ( TEN ) StevensJohnson syndrome exclude occurred patient receive lenalidomide . Patients receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition lenalidomide ( i.e . thalidomide ) . Patients know hypersensitivity anhydrous lactose , microcrystalline cellulose , croscarmellose sodium , magnesium stearate . Pregnant breast feeding female : Pregnant woman exclude study lenalidomide class potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother lenalidomide , breastfeed discontinue mother treated lenalidomide . Known HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction lenalidomide .
