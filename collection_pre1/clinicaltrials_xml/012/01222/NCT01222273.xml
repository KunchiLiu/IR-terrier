	<brief_title>Open-label Vitamin D Trial Patients With Cystic Fibrosis Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) cough mucus throat culture grow common fungus call Aspergillus . In patient CF , aspergillus know cause direct damage lung , patient respond allergic reaction cause wheeze , cough , difficulty breathing . This allergic reaction call ABPA . Current treatment ABPA include high dose steroid `` anti-fungal '' medicine . Treatment steroid may problematic people due side effect blood sugar level bone . Steroids medication decrease inflammation , include prednisone , medrol , dexamethasone others . Ongoing research UPMC study `` Mechanisms Immune Tolerance ABPA '' study people CF ABPA versus patient CF grow A. fumigatus ( Af ) sputum , ABPA . You may participate study . This study show people CF fungus , Af , sputum ABPA certain type cell blood help body regulate suppress allergic reaction people CF ABPA . Recent study demonstrate Vitamin D critical factor development cell suppress allergic reaction . People CF , due pancreatic insufficiency cause difficulty absorb fat , also low level fat soluble vitamin include vitamin D. In study do UPMC , `` Mechanisms Immune Tolerance ABPA '' , people CF ABPA significantly low vitamin D level people CF ABPA .</detailed_description>
