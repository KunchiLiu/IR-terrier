	<brief_summary>The purpose study explore volume change location volume change reconstruct breast use Contour Profile® tissue expander . Our purpose also investigate safety use CPX3® tissue-expander breast reconstruction via comparison complication rate result study complication rate use tissue expander type , report literature . We also hope demonstrate use 3-D imaging technology objective measure upper low breast volume change location volume change reconstruct breast . Finally , intend provide reconstructive surgeon scientific study quantifies patient satisfaction aesthetic result CPX3 tissue expander-implant breast reconstruction . We hypothesize CPX3 tissue expander provide low pole volume expansion compare low pole volume expansion round , standard tissue expanders report literature . Additionally , hypothesize CPX3 , combination human acellular dermis , less prone complication standard tissue expanders ( , report literature ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tissue expansion accept widely use method breast reconstruction . A drawback use standard tissue expanders unwanted fullness upper pole insufficient expansion lower pole breast . Round expanders result poor ptosis ( sag ) unwanted upper pole fullness without risk complication [ 1 , 2 ] . Anatomically-shaped expanders also shortcomings complication malposition [ 3-7 ] . A tissue expander design counteract upper pole fullness necessary achieve natural appear ptotic breast well-defined inframammary fold ( IMF ) [ 8 ] . The inframammary fold crease breast breast meet chest wall . Mentor 's Contour Profile® ( CPX3 ) tissue expander provide design great height width ratio great low pole expansion . It also suture tab back expander hold expander place prevent malposition . Another recent advancement tissue expander breast reconstruction use cadaveric-derived human acellular dermis rapid intraoperative expansion early projection [ 9-14 ] . The crescent-shaped expander study John YS Kim , MD retrospective review 40 consecutive patient underwent acellular dermis assist breast reconstruction . He find crescentric tissue expansion acellular dermis well tolerate high patient surgeon satisfaction likely due selective low pole expansion relate crescent shape , well significant immediate expansion relate large subpectoral pocket . To date , study report investigate low pole expansion result vary tissue expander dimension objective computer software [ 15 , 16 ] . The advent three-dimensional image technology objectively measure lower pole expansion provide quantitative mean study advantage use CPX3® tissue expander . We propose study show whether CPX3® tissue expander 's unique design ultimate effect shape location volume change postoperative breast . Three-dimensional camera also provide advantage assess patient undergoing bilateral mastectomy reconstruction desire reconstructive outcome bear resemblance current breast [ 15 ] . The 3-D imaging calculation evaluate follow parameter : absolute volume , absolute volume change , location expansion , base width , breast projection contour symmetry . Older method volume assessment would assume base breast flat plane . The Vectra system take account curvature chest wall , result accurate breast volume measurement . With 3-D imaging exposure radiation [ 16 ] . Another advantage 3-D imaging option view subject 's image angle , 360 degree [ 17 ] . Our study would show postoperative result use CPX3® tissue expander objective analysis degree lower-pole expansion . This prospective study . Fifteen patient enrol receive Contour profile tissue expander ( CPX3 ) reconstruction .</detailed_description>
