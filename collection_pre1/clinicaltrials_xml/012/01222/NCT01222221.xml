	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make peptide may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving vaccine therapy together temozolomide radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect vaccine therapy give together temozolomide radiation therapy treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess safety tolerability glioblastoma multiform multi-antigen vaccine IMA950 plus sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) combination standard chemoradiotherapy comprise temozolomide radiotherapy follow adjuvant temozolomide patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme . - To determine immunogenicity regimen patient . Secondary - To determine anti-tumor effect regimen patient . - To determine effect pre-treatment level regulatory T-cells immunogenicity regimen patient . ( Exploratory ) - To evaluate potential effect steroid dose immunological response glioblastoma multiform multi-antigen vaccine IMA950 plus GM-CSF . Tertiary - To assess level O6-methyl-DNA-methyltransferase ( MGMT ) promoter methylation tumor tissue potential association observe anti-tumor effect . - To evaluate kinetics observed immunogenicity glioblastoma multiform multi-antigen vaccine IMA950 plus GM-CSF . - To explore possible biomarker signature may predict immunological response glioblastoma multiform multi-antigen vaccine IMA950 plus GM-CSF . ( Exploratory ) - To explore possible effect regimen observe pseudo-progression pseudo-regression patient . ( exploratory ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients recruit cohort 1 2 priority recruitment cohort 1 . All patient undergo standard chemoradiotherapy follow adjuvant temozolomide plan . - Standard therapy ( chemoradiotherapy adjuvant temozolomide ) : Beginning surgery , patient receive chemoradiotherapy comprise oral temozolomide daily 6 week radiotherapy daily , 5 day week 6 week . Beginning 35 day completion radiotherapy , patient receive adjuvant oral temozolomide alone day 1-5 . Treatment temozolomide repeat every 28 day 6 course . - Vaccine therapy : Patients also receive vaccine therapy begin one two time point . Patients recruit 1 2 cohort differ time vaccination schedule relation patient 's standard therapy . - Cohort 1 : Vaccination begin 7-14 day prior chemoradiotherapy . - Induction phase : Patients receive first 6 dos sargramostim intradermally ( ID ) follow glioblastoma multiform multi-antigen vaccine IMA950 ID day 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 15 , 22 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Maintenance phase : Patients receive sargramostim follow glioblastoma multiform multi-antigen vaccine IMA950 ID day 50 78 day 21 adjuvant temozolomide course , begin course 1 , 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Cohort 2 : Vaccination begin least 7 day chemoradiotherapy 28 day prior adjuvant temozolomide . - Induction phase : Patients receive first 6 dos sargramostim follow glioblastoma multiform multi-antigen vaccine IMA950 ID cohort 1 induction phase , begin different time point . - Maintenance phase : Patients receive sargramostim follow glioblastoma multiform multi-antigen vaccine IMA950 ID day 21 adjuvant temozolomide course , begin course 1 , 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect periodically pharmacodynamic , biomarker , immunologic study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 41 week .
