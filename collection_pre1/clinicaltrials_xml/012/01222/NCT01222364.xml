	<detailed_description>This study test hypothesis delay clamp umbilical cord extremely low birthweight ( ELBW ) infant would result additional blood transfusion placenta baby , increase infant 's blood volume blood pressure . Higher blood pressure may improve blood flow brain may reduce potential risk hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE ) and/or intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) . The additional placental flow may also increase amount stem cell cytokine flow baby , improve immune status reduce risk infection , time reduce need blood transfusion neonatal period . This pilot study test feasibility obstetricians delay cord clamp 30-45 second , confirm whether procedure significantly increase baby 's hematocrit first 4 hour life .</detailed_description>
