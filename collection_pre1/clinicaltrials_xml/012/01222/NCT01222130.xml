	<brief_summary>This study design develop evaluate set non-virologic diagnostic algorithm monitor HIV-exposed child unknown infection status treatment eligibility first year life . The result cross sectional study expect used development series non-virologic algorithms determine treatment eligibility among HIV-exposed child setting polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test available guide judicious use PCR testing among HIV-exposed child setting PCR available .

	<brief_title>Non-virologic Methods Diagnose Treatment Eligibility HIV-exposed Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite recent scientific advance prevention mother-to-child transmission ( PMTCT ) , substantial donor investment , national commitment PMTCT program roll-out , pediatric HIV/AIDS remain largely uncontrolled epidemic . Unless intervention undertaken , half child become HIV-infected die second birthday . Yet sub-Saharan Africa , majority infect child die without ever confirmation HIV status , never chance begin life-saving antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . Recognizing need provide child great access care , World Health Organization ( WHO ) advise country least 10 % patient receive ART child . However , program fall well short target . Unlike diagnosis adult , definitive diagnosis HIV child less 18 month age require virologic test . Maternal IgG antibodies cross placenta fetal circulation pregnancy also secrete breast milk . As infant may retain maternal antibody 18 month birth , conventional HIV antibody test limit use determine positive infection status . Instead necessary directly identify HIV infection use virologic method , typically polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test detect viral DNA RNA . PCR test expensive , develop country , available specialty laboratory . Because PCR test complex common HIV laboratory assay ( e.g . CD4+ cell count ) , require technician considerably train technical skill , involve long sample preparation time , considerably costly diagnostic test . Thus , country large population HIV-infected child extremely limited capacity carry PCR testing . Even PCR available , pediatric HIV diagnosis may remain difficult breastfeed population infant continue risk infection breastfeed completely stop . A negative PCR test breastfeed guarantee infant remain uninfected . The alternative - serial test HIV infection - would result exponential increase cost . Indeed , convince argument make rather monitoring HIV-exposed breastfeeding child HIV infection , may appropriate simply monitor treatment eligibility , follow definitive antibody test 15-18 month month breastfeed stop . Those child meet criterion treatment could commence ART ; would continue undergo periodic screening wean old enough final ( definitive ) antibody test . For HIV-exposed infant without access HIV PCR test - vast majority Africa - development algorithm would obvious benefit provide reliable evaluation treatment eligibility first 18 month life . Even setting HIV PCR test available - may limit - introduction algorithm could reduce volume HIV PCR test require programmatic level , thus lead substantial cost-savings . The overall goal protocol develop evaluate set non-virologic diagnostic algorithm use monitor HIV-exposed child unknown infection status treatment eligibility first 12 week life , validation model among HIV-exposed child 12 month age . We evaluate performance different algorithms two separate common scenario Africa : ( 1 ) infant PCR test available , ( 2 ) infant PCR may available , poorly accessible due cost resource consideration . Although DNA PCR test become available Zambia , three site currently provide type test capacity may limit country-wide screening . Our study design determine HIV infection antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) eligibility use commonly use `` non-virologic '' test , CD4 , CD8 , HIV antibody , total lymphocyte count , hemoglobin , clinical staging . Previous study demonstrate indicator perform well absence DNA PCR test . In exploratory study , hypothesize combination test - formalize algorithm - yield high performance use rural setting reliable DNA PCR service yet available remain limited .</detailed_description>
