	<brief_title>Impact Vitamin D Therapies Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D help form strengthens bone allow body absorb calcium . Vitamin D help immune system fight infection well help keep muscle strong . Without enough vitamin D , bone become weak , thin brittle . Vitamin D useful people different type health issue . CKD slow loss kidney function time . The main function kidney remove waste excess water body . This loss function usually take month year occur Patients CKD often low level vitamin D blood . This study two group patient CKD one group patient normal kidney function , group low level vitamin D. The two group CKD ( group 1 group 2 ) receive either cholecalciferol calcitriol . The purpose control group ( group 3 ) without CKD evaluate change witness response vitamin D therapy specific patient kidney disease apply patient vitamin D deficiency receive vitamin D supplement . There two different drug study . One call Calcitriol approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) vitamin D supplement . The drug call cholecalciferol approve FDA . Unlike calcitriol , cholecalciferol nutritional form vitamin D often find various type food chemical structure must change body become active form vitamin D. It believe cholecalciferol may different effect body compare calcitriol . It possible CKD patient would benefit receive drug , currently unclear . While study receive either one study drug , depend group assign .</detailed_description>
