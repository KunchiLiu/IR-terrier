	<brief_title>Bendamustine Dexamethasone Patients With Relapsed AL Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic light-chain amyloidosis ( AL ) protein conformation disorder due clonal plasma cell dyscrasia . There establish approve second-line therapy patient systemic AL amyloidosis fail initial melphalan-based treatment , high-dose melphalan stem cell transplant oral melphalan dexamethasone ( MDex ) . Therefore new treatment need fail initial therapy initially respond subsequently relapse . Therapy AL generally base treatment regimen use multiple myeloma ( MM ) . Bendamustine achieve partial response relapsed/refractory MM . Based high anti-MM activity , anticipate bendamustine also active clonal plasma cell disorder associate AL .</detailed_description>
