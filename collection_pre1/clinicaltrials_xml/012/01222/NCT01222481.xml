	<detailed_description>Cancer second lead cause death United States today , account nearly quarter total death .

Investigations quality life experience survivor therefore become necessary survivor effectively manage course cancer . The increase number cancer survivor open relatively new avenue cancer research term Cancer Survivorship Research . Cancer Survivorship Research seek investigate physical , functional psychosocial consequence cancer . Despite advance make survivorship research , gap remain knowledge concern ability cancer survivor reintegrate life function pre-cancer level . These knowledge-gaps especially true head neck cancer patient demonstrate paucity study literature evaluate functional psychosocial consequence cancer cohort . This significant short-coming especially since head neck cancer patient increase risk adverse consequence due advance age time cancer diagnosis , comorbidity burden substantial history alcohol tobacco use . This study evaluate functional cognitive change occur head neck cancer patient result cancer treatment , attempt understand consequence cancer treatment quality life experience survivor . Our study use self-report questionnaire , neurocognitive assessment novel performance-based assessment evaluate functional cognitive health status two time-points : 1 . At Baseline ( cancer treatment modality ) 2 . After first stage cancer therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation surgery ) Assessments utilized include Center Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale ( CES-D ) , University Alabama Life Space Assessment Aids form ( LSA Aids ) , Dysexecutive Questionnaire ( DEX ) , Katz Index Activities Daily Living ( ADLs ) , Lawton Index Instrumental Activities Daily Living ( IADLs ) , University Alabama Life Space Assessment ( LSA ) , Short Blessed Test ( SBT ) , Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) , Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 ( ACE-27 ) , Delis Kaplan Executive Function Scale ( DKEFS ) - Sorting task , Color Word Interference task , Trail Making task . Participants also assess use Executive Function Performance Test ( EFPT ) . The EFPT performance-based measure cognitive function develop Program Occupational Therapy Washington University School Medicine ass ( direct observation ) amount assistance need participant complete five basic task essential self-maintenance independent living . The task include hand-washing , cooking , use telephone , take medication pay bill . Head Neck cancer patient undergo comprehensive assessment two time-points , allow ability follow change function cognition course cancer therapy . Statistical analysis perform SASÂ® software version 9.1.3 obtain descriptive statistic investigate statistically-significant change functional cognitive health status time-points evaluate .</detailed_description>
