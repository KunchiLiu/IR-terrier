	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers interested study disorder make individual susceptible fungal infection , specifically infection Candida yeast . These disorder often relate problem immune system may genetic factor , suggest researcher study individual disorder , also first- second-degree relative ( parent , sibling , child , first cousins ) . To provide material future research , individual immune disorder first- second-degree relative ask provide blood sample test comparison sample take healthy volunteer history immune disorder . Objectives : - To collect blood biological sample study immune disorder make individual susceptible fungal infection . Eligibility : - Individuals age abnormal immune function characterize recurrent unusual fungal infection , recurrent chronic inflammation , type immune dysfunction . - First- second-degree genetically relate family member ( limited mother , father , sibling , grandparent , child , aunt , uncle , first cousins ) . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age ( comparison purpose ) . Design : - Participants provide blood sample buccal ( cell inside mouth near cheek ) sample . - Participants immune disorder also ask provide urine sample , saliva mucosal sample , skin tissue biopsy , may also image study ( x-ray ) collect information research . - Samples may collect National Institutes Health clinical location sample send National Institutes Health . - No treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design evaluation , diagnosis , long-term follow select patient primary immune deficiency condition associate fungal , specifically Candida spp . infection . The primary immune deficiency study include , limited , autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy ( APECED ) , chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis ( CMC ) , myeloperoxidase deficiency ( MPO ) , immune dysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked ( IPEX ) , Job syndrome , chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) , biotinidase deficiency . Diabetic patient infant also show increased susceptibility infection might study . Patient participant ( refer patient study ) undergo evaluation include history/physical , blood sampling , genetic testing , possible tissue sample . We may use blood cell investigate utility induce pluripotent stem cell ( iPS ) immune cell derivation target gene correction . First second degree genetically relate family member ( limited mother , father , sibling , grandparent , child , aunt , uncle , first cousin affect patient refer relative study ) might also screen clinical , vitro , genetic correlate immune abnormality . Healthy volunteer enrol source control sample research test . Among aim protocol good understand genetic pathophysiologic factor lead defect host defense , use modern evolve method molecular cellular biology elucidate pathogenesis particular susceptibility . A good understanding primary immunodeficiency could allow rational development novel therapy diseases benefit future patient , might benefit current patient participant directly . Routine follow-up may occur every 6 month -with evaluation blood sample . Under circumstance , may provide treatment relate immune deficiency . These treatment follow standard medical practice .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patient Participants ( simply Patient ) : Patients abnormality immune function manifest recurrent unusual fungal infection , recurrent chronic inflammation , previous laboratory evidence immune dysfunction eligible screen assessment protocol . Of particular focus study patient : APECED ( autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy ) CMC ( chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis ) MPO ( myeloperoxidase deficiency ) IPEX ( immune dysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy Xlinked ) Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome ( Job syndrome ) CGD ( chronic granulomatous disease ) Biotinidase deficiency Other condition show increased susceptibility infection describe infant type 1 diabetic patientts There limit due age , sex , race , disability . All patient must primary physician outside NIH . Women childbearing potential , pregnant lactating , may eligible undergo test procedure , and/or receive medication prove minimal risk fetus child . Only diagnostic test without radiograph perform . All patient require blood store future study and/or medical condition . Relatives : Relatives may mother , father , sibling , child , grandparent , aunt , uncle , first cousins patient participant . There limit due age , sex , race , disability . Relatives require blood store future study and/or medical condition . Healthy volunteer must : Be adult either sex age 18 85 year old Have hemoglobin concentration great equal 11 g/dL Weigh great equal 110 pound EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patient : The presence certain type acquire abnormality immunity solely due human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , chemotherapeutic agent ( ) , underlying malignancy could ground possible exclusion subject . Relatives : The presence certain type acquire abnormality immunity solely due HIV , chemotherapeutic agent ( ) , underlying malignancy could ground possible exclusion relative . Healthy volunteer eligible : Receiving chemotherapeutic agent ( ) , underlie malignancy Pregnant lactating Have history heart , lung , kidney disease , bleed immunologic disorder lead significant incapacity Have history recurrent severe infection Have history HIV seropositivity Have history viral hepatitis ( B C )</criteria>
