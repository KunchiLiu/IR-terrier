	<brief_summary>Infants bear 34 36 week gestation , know 'late preterm ' , likely admit special care nursery , likely suffer respiratory complication infant born term . The use antenatal corticosteroid show improve lung function premature infant , evaluate likely deliver late preterm period . This research study attempt answer follow primary research question : Do steroid , compare steroid , decrease baby ' need oxygen support give pregnant woman least 12 24 hour deliver 34 week 36 week gestation ? The research study also collect information whether steroid improve chance baby get sick cause .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Antenatal Late Preterm Steroids ( ALPS ) : A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial : The rate preterm birth steadily increase United States past 10 year . This increase driven part rise rate late preterm birth , define birth occur 34 36 week . Late preterm infant experience high rate readmission term counterpart , infant likely suffer complication respiratory distress , kernicterus , feed difficulty , hypoglycemia . Late preterm infant also high mortality cause compare term infant . The use antenatal corticosteroid show beneficial woman risk preterm delivery prior 34 week evaluate likely deliver late preterm period . If show reduce need respiratory support thus decrease rate special care nursery admission improve short-term outcome , public health economic impact considerate . This protocol describe randomize placebo control trial evaluate whether antenatal corticosteroid decrease rate neonatal respiratory support , thus decrease rate neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) admission improve short-term outcome late preterm infant .</detailed_description>
