	<brief_summary>This K23 award application relevant multiple topic area recent Institute Medicine ( IOM ) research priority list , well recent IOM report brief White House `` Let 's Move '' Campaign focus childhood obesity . The US prevalence childhood-onset obesity type 2 diabetes , predictor cardiovascular risk , increase epidemic proportion recent decade . Children mental illness , especially treat antipsychotic medication , additional risk obesity relate risk condition . Despite known increase obesity-related outcome , include premature mortality , associate childhood-onset versus adult-onset obesity , remain under-appreciation risk child . A variety noninvasive technique assess cardiometabolic risk begin applied child , include carotid intima medium thickness ( IMT ) measure ultrasound , hepatic triglyceride content ( IHTG ) measure 1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) . These measure allow early , noninvasive study metabolic risk . Unfortunately , none promise method apply high-risk population child psychiatric disorder , cardiac triglyceride content evaluate child , prevent accurate characterization risk effectiveness intervention reduce risk vulnerable population . The overall aim two-study research plan characterize level measurable risk use sensitive marker treat untreated child mental health disorder , evaluate magnitude change risk observe use biomarkers child receive well establish behavioral weight-loss intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose research seek increase knowledge regard biomarkers metabolic risk child mental health condition , building measure body composition insulin sensitivity use MEAC . This project utilize sensitive , early biomarkers disease risk , include hepatic triglyceride content ( HTGC ) carotid IMT , directly relevant diabetes cardiovascular disease risk , respectively . The overall aim characterize metabolic risk associate weight use sensitive biomarkers child mental health disorder , evaluate magnitude change observe biomarkers child receive establish behavioral weight-loss intervention . This accomplish two phase . Study PHASE 1 involve pilot test 17-week behavioral weight loss intervention , well feasibility evaluate HTCG IMT value 3-5 overweight/obese psychiatrically ill youth age 6-18 treated antipsychotic medication . Aim 1 : To test feasibility deliver exist family-based behavioral weight loss program family psychiatrically ill youth overweight obese . Primary Hypotheses : psychiatrically ill youth family participate exist intensive behavioral weight loss intervention . Study PHASE 2 involve randomize control trial , test effect family base weight loss intervention weight metabolic biomarkers overweight obese mentally ill child ( 30 ) compare age- , gender- BMi % ile-matched healthy control ( 30 ) . Participants antipsychotic treat group randomize 2:1 either weekly `` study '' group monthly `` standard care '' group . A group healthy control receive weekly `` study '' treatment ( 20 ) reference group receive monthly standard care condition ( 10 ) . In addition , pilot study perform determine feasibility explore association obesity treatment response , measure executive function reward sensitivity , rs-fcMRI default mode network ( DMN ) reward network antipsychotic-treated healthy control youth participate 17-week behavioral weight loss parent study describe . Each participant pilot study undergo baseline fMRI brain image cognitive processing evaluation . Aim 1 : To evaluate effect 17-weeks behavioral weight loss intervention DEXA-measured whole body adiposity overweight/obese antipsychotic-treated child compare healthy control . Aim 2 : To evaluate effect 17-weeks behavioral weight loss intervention hepatic tissue triglyceride concentration ( HTGC ) overweight/obese antipsychotic-treated child compare healthy control . Aim 3 : To evaluate effect 17-weeks behavioral weight loss intervention carotid IMT overweight/obese antipsychotic-treated child compare healthy control . Aim 4 : To characterize baseline cognitive processing 15-20 obese antipsychotic-treated healthy control youth prior participation 17-week behavioral weight loss intervention . Aim 5 : Characterize baseline brain volumetric rest state functional connectivity 15-20 obese antipsychotic-treated healthy control youth prior engagement 17-week behavioral weight loss intervention . Primary Hypothesis : Change DEXA-measured total fat HGTC/IMT pronounce weight loss intervention group compare diet exercise education alone . Exploratory Aims : To evaluate change standard cardiometabolic risk factor ( e.g. , fast lipid , insulin , glucose , adiponectin , fibrinogen , high sensitivity C-reactive protein low density lipoprotein particle size ) differences adherence intervention mentally ill non-mentally ill youth .</detailed_description>
