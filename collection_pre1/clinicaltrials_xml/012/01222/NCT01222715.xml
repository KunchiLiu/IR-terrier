	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well vinorelbine tartrate cyclophosphamide work combination bevacizumab temsirolimus treat patient recurrent refractory rhabdomyosarcoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , vinorelbine tartrate cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth rhabdomyosarcoma block blood flow tumor . Temsirolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy effective give together bevacizumab temsirolimus treat rhabdomyosarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vinorelbine Tartrate Cyclophosphamide Combination With Bevacizumab Temsirolimus Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Rhabdomyosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : l. To determine feasibility administer bevacizumab combination intravenous vinorelbine ( vinorelbine tartrate ) cyclophosphamide ( VC ) patient recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma ( RMS ) . II . To determine feasibility administer temsirolimus combination VC patient recurrent RMS . III . To estimate event-free survival ( EFS ) patient recurrent/refractory RMS treat bevacizumab VC compare EFS treat temsirolimus VC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate initial ( 2 cycle ) response rate patient recurrent/refractory RMS treat bevacizumab VC compare response rate treat temsirolimus VC , also compare best response rate regimen protocol therapy . II . To evaluate surrogate biological marker patient recurrent RMS estimate difference marker follow treatment bevacizumab temsirolimus . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive vinorelbine tartrate intravenously ( IV ) 6-10 minute day 1 8 cyclophosphamide IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive vinorelbine tartrate cyclophosphamide arm I . Patients also receive temsirolimus IV 30-60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . In arm , treatment repeat every 21 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
