	<brief_summary>Background : - Marqibo ( Registered Trademark ) new anticancer drug . It combine Vincristine sulfate , widely use anticancer drug , package tiny fat bubble know liposome . The goal improve drug 's ability destroy cancer cell help reduce potential side effect treatment . - Vincristine sulfate originally develop chemical find periwinkle plant act multiple type malignant cancer . It approve multiple cancer type include solid tumor blood cancer . - Research show Marqibo ( Registered Trademark ) able slow stop growth cancer cell adult , alone combination chemotherapy drug , research need determine use child . - There one previous small study Marqibo ( Registered Trademark ) child . Although anti-cancer activity see , side effect optimal dose fully determine . - As see standard Vincristine suflate , common side effect Marqibo ( Registered Trademark ) involve nervous system . It cause numbness tingle hands foot . Symptoms commonly improve drug discontinue dose lower . Objectives : - To determine safety efficacy Marqibo treatment child diagnose certain type malignant cancer respond standard treatment . Eligibility : - Children adolescents 2 21 year age diagnose certain type malignant cancer respond standard treatment . - These cancer type include solid tumor , primary brain tumor , leukemia , lymphoma ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Evaluate Safety , Activity Pharmacokinetics Marqibo Children Adolescents With Refractory Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND - Vincristine sulfate widely use antineoplastic agent alkaloid class drug derive periwinkle plant ( Vinca rosea Linn. ) . It activity wide number malignancy . It cell-cycle-specific agent arrest cell growth M-phase ( metaphase ) bind specifically tubulin disrupt cell division . Its dose limiting toxicity ( DLT ) virtually always neurological . - Investigations past two decade demonstrate liposomal drug carrier capable increase therapeutic index anticancer drug alter drug pharmacological behavior . - Marqibo ( Registered Trademark ) vincristine encapsulate sphingomyelin/cholesterol ( SM/CHOL ) liposomes , developed increase activity vincristine . It show activity Phase 2 study adult . Previous investigation Marqibo ( Registered Trademark ) child limit . A small phase 2 study conduct dose 2.0mg/m2 every 14 day . The agent appear well tolerate activity see , although data quite limited . OBJECTIVES - To define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , toxicity profile , dose-limiting toxicity , pharmacokinetics child adolescent solid tumor hematologic malignancy receive weekly intravenous dos Marqibo ( Registered Trademark ) . - To define tolerability potential activity Marqibo ( Registered Trademark ) child adolescent relapse refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) pediatric MTD . ELIGIBILITY - Children adolescent ( great equal 2 year &lt; 21 year age ) histologically confirm relapsed refractory malignant disease measurable evaluable . DESIGN - Marqibo ( Registered Trademark ) administer intravenously 60 minute ( + -10 minute ) every 7 day ( + - 3 day ) ( Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ) four dos ( 1 cycle ) . Cycles may repeat every 28 day maximum 6 cycle ; additional cycle may offer evidence acceptable toxicity clinical benefit . - The trial follow standard phase I design 3 6 subject per dose level standard definition MTD DLT . At MTD , total 6 additional subject relapse refractory ALL evaluate . - Detailed pharmacokinetic study perform first treatment cycle .</detailed_description>

Isolated CNS testicular disease NOT allow . MEASURABLE/EVALUABLE DISEASE : Subjects must measurable evaluable malignant disease . PRIOR THERAPY : The subject cancer must relapse failed respond frontline curative therapy must potentially curative treatment option available subject time study entry . Subjects must last dos therapy prior receive first dose investigational agent follow ( provided complete recovery acute toxic effect ) : 1 . Chemotherapy least 14 day ( 6 week nitrosoureas ) ; 2 . Radiation least 21 day ; 3 . Any investigational cancer therapy monoclonal antibody therapy ( e.g. , rituximab ) least 30 day . Exceptions requirement : Intrathecal chemotherapy : There time restriction regard prior intrathecal chemotherapy provide complete recovery acute toxic effect . Radiation therapy : There time restriction regard prior radiation provide volume bone marrow treat less 10 % measurable disease outside radiation port . Patients receive corticosteroid hydroxyurea eligible provide follow condition meet . Patients CNS tumor manage steroid eligible stable decrease dose steroid worsen neurologic deficit great equal 7 day prior registration . The subject corticosteroid hydroxyurea Corticosteroids use manage GVHD . There increase hydroxyurea dose 2 week prior start Marqibo . Subjects must recover toxic effect ( Grade 1 baseline ) prior therapy entry onto trial . Subjects hematopoietic colony stimulate factor least 72 hour prior study entry . Subjects prior history stem cell transplantation must immunosuppressive therapy least 4 week active graftversushost disease ( GVHD ) exception Grade 1 acute time entry onto trial .
