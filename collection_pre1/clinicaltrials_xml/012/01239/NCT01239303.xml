	<brief_title>Effects Citrulline Gut Functioning During Excercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract play important role human body . The wall GI system regulate digestion absorption nutrient also important function barrier internal external environment . The penetration harmful substance microbiota GI lumen ( external environment ) systemic circulation ( internal environment ) depend barrier . Previous study show exercise healthy subject provide hypoperfusion splanchnic area , result intestinal damage , increase small intestinal permeability liver damage . Similar splanchnic hypoperfusion occur patient compromised circulation . During episode splanchnic hypoperfusion , de novo synthesis nitric oxide ( nitric oxide , NO ) arginine compromise . This impaired NO synthesis may play role development organ dysfunction exercise . L-citrulline administration , precursor arginine NO , may result improved NO availability organ perfusion , thereby prevent organ damage .</detailed_description>
