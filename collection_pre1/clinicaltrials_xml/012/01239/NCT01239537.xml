	<brief_summary>In 2009 World Health Organization ( WHO ) declare Influenza A H1N1 ( swine 'flu ) outbreak first global pandemic century . It think responsible 16,226 death globally 21st February 2010 . The investigator know previous influenza outbreak number case also tend increase winter season year pandemic . There concern last year 's pandemic influenza strain return winter , therefore , include WHO 's recommendation seasonal influenza vaccine combination . This study assess duration immune response H1N1 influenza vaccine give last year , child respond year 's seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine ( include H1N1 strain ) . Participating child would receive one dose license seasonal influenza vaccine blood test would take vaccination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Swine Flu ( Influenza A H1N1 ) Follow Vaccine Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Autumn 2009 investigator undertake study assess safety immunogenicity two-dose schedule two Influenza A ( H1N1 ) vaccine purchase UK Government , non-adjuvanted whole virion vaccine ASO3-adjuvanted split-virion , child age 6 month 12 year age . 937 child complete study protocol main finding adjuvanted vaccine , reactogenic , immunogenic especially young child ( seroconversion child 3 year age 98.2 % vs. 80.1 % , p=0.001 ) . Following event Australia , regardless formal investigation outcome , imperative study reactogenicity UK seasonal influenza vaccine child previously receive immunization adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine . It would particularly important gain early information fever rate young child order ass whether high expect carry potential risk febrile convulsion . It also important determine immunogenicity trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine child previously give univalent pandemic influenza vaccine . There emerge data different prim strategy adjuvanted non-adjuvanted vaccine may lead considerable difference response subsequent influenza vaccine . In head head paediatric study unpublished analyse show significantly low immunogenicity child receive seasonal influenza vaccine past , despite receipt two dos either Pandemrix Celvepan . In addition , unpublished data manufacturer study suggest negative effect two dos Pandemrix immune response subsequent seasonal vaccine give 3 week second dose ( personal communication E Miller MHRA ) . Alternatively , show pandemic H5N1 influenza vaccine , may significant booster response subsequent dose follow prim 6 14 month previously . However , demonstrate either Pandemrix Celvapan , unknown previous vaccination vaccine affect immunogenicity H1N1 component unadjuvanted trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine give year later . The investigator therefore propose follow-on study compare firstly , persistence antibody A/California/7/2009 ( H1N1 ) virus use novel H1N1 influenza vaccine secondly immunogenicity reactogenicity one dose non-adjuvanted trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine child , receive two-dose immunisation regimen either Pandemrix Celvapan . In previous pandemic , wave infection subsequent influenza season , particularly pandemic strain drift antigenically . It important therefore study persistence antibody pandemic influenza A ( H1N1 ) infection child , particularly seasonal influenza vaccine recommend next year . Should drift H1N1 strain emerge next season , serum child vaccinate 2009 A/California/7/2009 ( H1N1 ) strain could use assess likely cross protection drift strain . The existence unique cohort almost 1000 child allow information antibody persistence generate non-adjuvanted whole virion vaccine ( Celvapan ) ASO3-adjuvanted split-virion vaccine ( Pandemrix ) would provide valuable source serum ass cross protection event emergence drift strain . The investigator therefore propose follow-on study compare firstly , persistence antibody A/California/7/2009 ( H1N1 ) virus use novel H1N1 influenza vaccine secondly immunogenicity reactogenicity one dose nonadjuvanted trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine child , receive two-dose immunisation regimen either Pandemrix Celvapan . This follow-on study also provide important opportunity provide data long term safety Pandemrix Celvapan vaccines prior enrolment follow-on study . The study use non-adjuvanted trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine , FluarixÂ® ( GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals , Dresden , Germany ) . It approve EMEA prophylaxis influenza age market since 1987 . It consistently show meet exceed regulatory criterion immunogenicity three strain H1N1 , H3N2 B , good safety profile . ( 18 ) Although option receive vaccine ( blood test ass immune response vaccine ) offer participant study , participant ( parents/ guardian , participant 's behalf ) may decline receive vaccine second blood test . These participant would still eligible take part study first blood test assess persistence antibody original study . Persistence seroprotection assess haemagglutination inhibition ( HI ) microneutralisation ( MN ) . Although EMEA guideline licensure influenza vaccine base HI assay , primary objective study use MN titre measure . The decision preference MN titres HI titre make base recently publish observation Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) ( 19 , 20 ) result Health Protection Agency 's analysis , show MN assay generally yield high titre detect seroconversions A/California/04/2009 HI assay ( although generally show high correlation ) . The investigator therefore used MN titres primary outcome measure original NIHR fund study ( Clinicaltrials.gov registration number : NCT00980850 ) ( 1 ) The cellular immune response influenza immunisation assess child sufficient blood available local laboratory facility permit . Elispot assay carry use PBMCs isolate blood determine T cell response internal influenza antigen , haemagglutinin ( pandemic H1 , seasonal H1 seasonal H3 ) . Exploratory flow cytometry assay may also use determine whether T cell CD4+ CD8+ , examine cytokine secretion . RNA expression profile pre post vaccination scrutinise 20 participant group elucidate gene differentially express response immunisation . This analysis could highlight gene particular importance vaccine response . Furthermore , comparison RNA profile correlate vaccine immunity may identify profile could useful 'biomarkers ' vaccine induce cellular humoral immunity future study . With appropriate consent , serum sample remain analysis require study store use future infection immunity relate research study relevant study site .</detailed_description>
