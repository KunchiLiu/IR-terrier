	<brief_title>Insulin Detemir Obesity Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Together obesity , diabetes epidemic US ( 20 ) worldwide ( 21 ) . Increased body weight risk factor diabetes ( 22 ) consequence initiation intensification insulin therapy , illustrate landmark diabetes control trial ( 1-3 ) . Weight gain worsen insulin resistance lead high insulin requirement , , thus perpetuate vicious cycle ( 36 ) , ultimate effect may enhance metabolic risk ( 15 , 35 ) . For example , analysis diabetes control complication trial ( DCCT ) reveal high quartile weight gain intensive treatment lead hyperlipidemia increase blood pressure ; i.e . metabolic syndrome ( 35 ) . Thus , glycemic control clearly critical metabolic target diabetes outcomes , additional consideration , include body weight ( adiposity ) weight gain , fundamental importance clinical management complex disease diabetes . Of course , overweight obesity clearly critical risk factor development type II diabetes first place ( 10 ) , weight gain generates significant negative `` biofeedback '' patient physician struggle achieve control ( 33 ) . Mechanisms involve weight gain insulin therapy incompletely understood : hypoglycemia potent stimulus feed ( 11 ) , improve glycemic control reverse negative energy balance associate glycosuria ( loss energy glucose urine ) , insulin clearly potent anabolic hormone peripheral tissue ( 37 ) . In contrast ample evidence associate insulin therapy weight gain , distinct body evidence indicate insulin function adiposity negative feedback signal brain ( 23 ) limit food intake weight gain . It generally accept insulin play important role neural control energy homeostasis ( match caloric intake energy expenditure maintain body weight ) well glucose homeostasis via neural effect ( 23 ) . Of course , discuss , insulin numerous effect CNS range modulation reward ( 12 ) , cognition ( 31 ) , mood ( 32 ) . Indeed , overarch hypothesis study insulin modulate brain function manner beneficial . Food reward loosely described process involve liking , want , learn acquire food aspect represent separate overlap neuropsychological substrate . To put even simply , reward sense satisfaction pleasure derive eat . Food reward sensory , integrative , motor component , contribute consummatory behavior ( 38 ) . Relevant focus particular study , monoamine neurotransmitter dopamine , heavily involve generation food reward . Insulin , signal generate response food intake , function decrease , control food reward ( 12 ) . Reward , define sense satisfaction , indeed , pleasure result feed increasingly recognize potentially potent influence food intake share neuoranatomical neurochemical correlate substance abuse ( although clear difference well ) . Although neurotransmitter ( particular opioids endocannabinoids ) involve reward , monoamine neurotransmitter , dopamine ( DA ) strongly implicate mediate reward food ( stimulus ) . The midbrain particularly rich dopamine neuron , originate ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) project ventral ( nucleus accumbens , NAc ) dorsal ( caudate putamen ) striatum , brain area integrate subserve reward food seek behavior . While circuitry involve feed reward complex , discreet brain area ( dorsal ventral striatum ) heavily dopaminergic , implicated reward , brain area group great deal expertise study . Dopamine secrete synapse pre-synaptic nerve terminal either bind activate dopamine receptor signaling , clear synaptic cleft specific transporter molecule . The dopamine receptor interest study D2 receptor , well studied isoform involve feeding . Similarly , dopamine transporter well study , play critical role dopamine neurotransmission , regulate insulin . In study utilize PET radioligands quantify expression D2 receptor . We additionally utilize functional brain imaging ( functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) ) quantify change dopamine circuit response food cue ( visual image obesogenic food ) response probe dopamine transporter function . Although weight-gain insulin initiation intensification common , numerous report randomize , control human clinical trial describe attenuation effect basal insulin analogue , detemir ( ( 17 ) , review ( 18 ) ) . Intriguingly , observe weight spar effect detemir appear amplify obese ( 18 ) , i.e . effect detemir evident even amplified situation insulin resistance severe . This scenario entirely consistent overarch hypothesis describe throughout . The current study utilize insulin detemir tool understand weight effect insulin mediate CNS effect identify mechanism involve observed weight spar effect . Insulin detemir approve FDA treatment diabetes 2005 . Detemir long-acting , basal insulin analogue unique pharmacological property believe confers capacity regulate brain insulin sensitive process . Compared regular human insulin , detemir one amino acid delete , medium chain fatty acid conjugate amino acid B29 . Conjugation fatty acid confers prolong absorption subcutaneous depot mediates polymerization slow release . Additionally fatty acid confers albumin bind plasma , increase half-life , provide second buffering mechanism prolongation duration action . We hypothesize fatty acid additionally confers enhance transport CNS and/or , enhance signal insulin receptor context insulin resistance establish . In clinical development program , insulin detemir note cause significantly less weight gain , safety perspective also associate less hypoglycemia . Rationale study . Firstly , dopamine neurotransmission underlies reward . Several high visibility study human provide proof-of-principle data support hypothesis defect dopamine homeostasis contribute pathophysiology obesity ( 40 , 41 ) . By PET imaging , dopamine D2 receptor availability ( radioligand bind potential ) reduce BMI dependent fashion ; i.e . increase body mass , less dopamine D2 receptor available brain dopamine signaling ( lead reduce dopamine signaling ; hypodopaminergia ) . Similarly , brain activation , measure functional MR imaging ( use technique similar utilized herein ) , reduce obese individual posse polymorphism gene regulate dopamine signal . This work , together ever expand body preclinical work indicate obesity chronic state reduce dopamine signaling , hypodopaminergia ; indeed condition term `` hypodopaminergic reward deficiency syndrome . '' As preliminary data support dopamine neurotransmission regulatory influence insulin ; insulin regulate intracellular trafficking transporter ( analogous insulin regulation glucose transporter trafficking ) , traffic require maintain fidelity dopamine signal via D2 receptor</detailed_description>
