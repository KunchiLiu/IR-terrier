	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize , control trial determine whether vibration platform exercise program effective standard platform exercise program improve quadriceps strength woman age 45-60 risk factor knee osteoarthritis . Each platform exercise program conduct 2 time week 12 week . The session consist series exercise Wave Pro-elite vibration platform ( 1-3 minute rest set ) stretch platform vibration either turn ( intervention group ) ( control group . ) Quadriceps strength ( primary outcome ) , leg press power , vibration sense assess baseline 12 week , change score compare group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) common disable disease old adult , ( 1 ) affect 25 million Americans , result significantly impair function mobility ( 2 ) societal economic burden . ( 3 ) The knee weight-bearing joint commonly affect , ( 10 ) prevalence symptomatic knee OA 9 % 21 % among 65 year old . ( 2 , 11 , 21 ) Loss knee range motion lead significant difficulty bathing , low body dressing , stair mobility , walk . Impaired mobility due knee OA increasingly significant societal impact , 67 million adult project arthritis 2030 , 25 million arthritis-attributable activity limitation . ( 22 ) Women great risk knee OA compare men . Knee OA lead chronic disability , ( 23-25 ) functional limitation , ( 26 ) dependence . ( 27 ) Patients knee OA frequently limit activity joint stiffness buckling , decrease range motion , muscle weakness , poor balance , impaired proprioception , reduce vibration sense , and/or pain . Currently , limit option available patient improve outcome knee OA . At time , patient may use analgesic pain total knee replacement last option . However , recently find great quadriceps strength protect development incident symptomatic knee OA progression knee OA woman . ( 19-20 ) Thus , strengthen quadriceps muscle may prevent worsen knee joint . Though study whether strengthen effective reduce risk knee OA , necessary first determine effective tolerate mean exercise . Vibration platform exercise may provide benefit strength training without add potentially harmful load knee joint . In one study nursing home resident limit functional capacity , balance mobility improve 6-week whole body vibration exercise program . ( 12 ) In another study compare whole body vibration ( WBV ) resistance train old woman , great improvement knee extensor strength speed movement find WBV exercise . ( 13 ) Additionally , 2-month exercise program older adult age 59 86 , walk speed , step length , maximum standing time one leg significantly improve WBV exercise . ( 14 ) WBV exercise safe well tolerate elderly . ( 14 , 15 , 16 ) There also indication WBV may improve flexibility . While study test range motion ( ROM ) find WBV control group significant increase hamstring flexibility , WBV group show significantly large increase ( 30 % ) ROM control group ( 14 % ) . ( 17 ) There also indication WBV may improve proprioception ( joint position sense ) woman knee osteoarthritis . One study compare control versus exercise vibration platform balance board vibration platform find improvement muscle strength proprioception , respectively . ( 18 ) Thus , study suggest beneficial effect WBV exercise addition muscle strengthening , balance , walk exercise improve walk ability elderly . Exercises conduct vibrate platform induce muscle reflex , increase muscle fiber activation high level compare performing exercise non-vibrating platform . We select frequency duration program base 1 ) frequency use previous study recommend manufacturer 2 ) duration 12 week base previous data find gain knee extensor strength speed movement occur week 12 24-week program . ( 13 ) Vibration exercise may better option strength train alone , exercise complete less time similar strength gain resistance training , without additional load contribute stress patient ' joint .</detailed_description>
