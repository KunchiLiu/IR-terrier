	<brief_title>Vismodegib Treating Younger Patients With Recurrent Refractory Medulloblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate efficacy GDC-0449 ( vismodegib ) treatment pediatric patient recurrent refractory medulloblastoma , measure sustain objective response rate patient without ( stratum A ) ( stratum B ) evidence activation Hedgehog ( Hh ) signal pathway tumor . II . Characterize pharmacokinetics ( plasma ) GDC-0449 children/adolescents refractory medulloblastoma . III . To document pathologic genomic method identify medulloblastomas activation Hh signal pathway . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Document describe toxicity associate GDC-0449 administered daily schedule . II . Estimate duration objective response progression-free survival ( PFS ) . III . Characterize pharmacokinetics ( cerebrospinal fluid ) GDC-0449 children/adolescents refractory medulloblastoma . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord evidence activation Hedgehog signal pathway tumor ( without v v unknown ) . Patients receive vismodegib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 26 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Plasma cerebrospinal fluid sample collect periodically pharmacokinetic correlative study . After completion study treatment , patient follow every month 12 month .</detailed_description>
