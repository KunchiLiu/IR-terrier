	<brief_title>MK2206 Treating Patients With Advanced Liver Cancer That Did Not Respond Previous Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate median progression-free survival patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma treat MK-2206 failure one prior line anti-angiogenic therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate objective response rate ( CR + PR ) . II . Evaluate median overall survival . III . Evaluate tolerability toxicity profile MK-2206 patient population . IV . Explore , preliminary fashion , potential molecular predictor efficacy . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral Akt inhibitor MK2206 day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3-6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
