	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) currently second common cause cancer death United States , one preventable cancer . It show several randomized control trial screen use fecal occult blood testing ( FOBT ) reduce CRC mortality 13-33 % . While strong consensus amongst expert regard value CRC screening , best approach screen clear . Of widely recommended modality , FOBT colonoscopy commonly use within United States . FOBT inexpensive , non-invasive , use screen tool support high quality evidence ( i.e . randomize controlled trial ) . Moreover , new FOBT , fecal immunochemical test FITs , advantage conventional FOBT term test characteristic ease use make quite attractive population-based screening tool . While colonoscopy invasive high up-front risk cost FOBT , afford opportunity directly assess colonic mucosa widely believe best test detect colorectal cancer . In addition , colonoscopy allow detection removal colorectal adenoma -a well recognize colorectal cancer precursor . There indirect evidence suggest colonoscopy effective reduce colorectal cancer mortality , date , large clinical trial complete support assumption . While colonoscopy use increase , data emerge colonoscopy may effective previously believe . Prior support colonoscopy screen test rely upon effectiveness estimate appear overly optimistic . Given invasive nature colonoscopy , associate small , real risk complication , dramatically high cost screen test , especially important determine true comparative effectiveness colonoscopy relative proven non-invasive option . The investigator propose perform , large , simple , multicenter , randomize , parallel group trial directly compare screen colonoscopy annual FIT screening average risk individual . The hypothesis colonoscopy superior FIT prevention colorectal cancer mortality measure 10 year . Individuals enrol currently eligible CRC screening ( e.g . colonoscopy past 10 year FOBT past 1 year ) 50 75 year age . The investigator exclude individual colonoscopy indicate ( e.g . sign symptom CRC , first degree family member CRC , personal history colorectal neoplasia inflammatory bowel disease ) . All participant complete baseline demographic , medication , lifestyle questionnaire ( e.g . diet , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory use , frequency exercise ) prior randomization 1:1 ratio either screen colonoscopy annual FIT screening ( Figure 1 ) . Those test positive FIT undergo evaluation determine appropriateness colonoscopy . Screening perform manner consistent currently accept standard care order determine comparative effectiveness two screening strategy . Participants survey annually determine undergone colonoscopy diagnose CRC . The primary study endpoint CRC mortality within 10 year enrollment . The secondary endpoint ( 1 ) incidence CRC within 10 year enrollment ( 2 ) major complication colonoscopy . Mortality determine query VA Vital Status File . Cause death determine primarily use death certificate National Death Index-Plus database , augment adjudication medical record know CRC case CRC list cause death death certificate . The investigator postulate screen colonoscopy result 40 % reduction CRC mortality 10 year relative annual FIT screening . Using log-rank test 2-sided test significance , =0.05 , sample size 50,000 participant require test primary hypothesis 82 % power , assume 1 % annual rate crossover FIT colonoscopy 0.5 % annual rate loss follow-up . The plan study duration 12.5 year 2.5 year recruitment 10 year follow-up enrol participant .</brief_summary>
