	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer third common form cancer find United States . To date surgical resection provide best chance cure . Unfortunately , despite `` curative '' surgery , tumor recurrence develop 30-40 % patient either unforeseen residual metastasis viable tumor cell shed circulation time surgery . There evidence human mice suggest tumor growth stimulate surgery period time . This study call administration green tea extract milk thistle extract , two orally ingested supplement , week immediately week surgery . It current standard care give anti-cancer drug perioperative period . The basic idea behind study beneficial inhibit cancer growth day lead follow surgery . Why case ? It make sense limit inhibit tumor growth surgery drug provide do safely interfere surgery . It also logical give anti-cancer drug surgery , unfortunately , 35 percent colorectal cancer patient , resection , hidden tumor cell remain body . There also strong human evidence tumor growth stimulate first month tumor resection result surgical injury heal process . Therefore , good reason give anti-cancer drug soon possible surgery order offset surgery 's negative effect . Although supplement give safely wide variety patient number different medical problem , two supplement together never give cancer patient week follow surgery . We hypothesize administration two supplement together safe period surround colorectal cancer surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Green tea extract Silibinin ( milk thistle plant ) show experimental study anti-cancer effect well limited toxicity . Epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG ) major active catechin green tea ; show prevent limit tumor growth murine models1-3 . Silymarin , extract seed milk thistle plant , use clinically hepatoprotective agent Europe4 . Its major active component , Silibinin , well-tolerated largely free adverse effects5-6 . In recent study , Silibinin show inhibit growth number cancer mouse model , include lung7 , bladder8 , liver9 , prostate10 , colon11-12 . Silibinin EGCG similar anti-neoplastic mechanism include : 1 ) cell cycle arrest via upregulation P21 P27 downregulation CDK , 2 ) induction apoptosis via Caspase-3 activation cleavage poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) , 3 ) suppression angiogenesis metastasis via inhibition vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP-9 )</detailed_description>
