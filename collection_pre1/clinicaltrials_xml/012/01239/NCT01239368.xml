	<brief_summary>Background : - Cancer development associate problem immune system function , prevent body attack destroy abnormal cell lead tumor growth . Research suggest certain white blood cell , know Th1 Th2 T cell , affect individual kind cancer -- proportion Th2 cell great Th1 cell , immune system ability fight growth malignant tumor weaken . Researchers interested determine infusion specially modify Th1 cell , addition stem cell transplant , safe effective treatment individual form multiple myeloma might respond well standard treatment alone . Objectives : - To determine safety effectiveness infusion modify Th1 white blood cell , conjunction standard treatment , treatment individual diagnose high-risk form multiple myeloma . Eligibility : - Individuals age 18 75 newly diagnose high-risk multiple myeloma receive minimal treatment ( 4 month less ) yet.. Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , image study . Some participant may also bone marrow type biopsy evaluate state disease . - White blood cell collect participant apheresis procedure , collect separate white blood cell return rest blood participant . - The collected cell grow expand special condition laboratory store frozen participant receive standard care treatment multiple myeloma , include stem cell transplant . - Participants receive infusion modify Th1 cell week transplant , remain hospital day receive cell monitor possible immediate effect treatment . - Participants regular follow-up visit study long-term effect modify Th1 cell infusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Th1/Tc1 Immunotherapy Following Stem Cell Transplantation Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation ( AHCT ) , represent standard care newly diagnose Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) , curative therapy . New approach prevent relapse AHCT treat relapse need . - In murine model , use ex vivo culture generate rapamycin-resistant , Th1/Tc1 polarize T cell ( Th1/Tc1.Rapa cell ) rapamycin-resistant apoptosis-resistant increase vivo survival vivo function . - Because Th1 /Tc1 polarize lymphocyte pivotal anti-tumor effect , hypothesize adoptive transfer Th1/Tc1Rapa cell benefit MM patient . Objectives : Primary Dose escalation study Evaluate feasibility toxicity infusion autologous , ex vivo rapamycin-generated , anti-CD3 anti-CD28 co-stimulated , Th1/Tc1 lymphocytes ( Th1.rapa cell ) subject diagnose high-risk multiple myeloma follow AHCT . MM Relapse Prevention Treatment Cohorts - For Cohort A , newly diagnose MM patient receive AHCT , evaluate safety define regimen Th1/Tc1.Rapa cell therapy determine progression-free survival . - For Cohort B , relapse MM , determine PR/CR rate Th1/Tc1.Rapa cell therapy . Eligibility : - For CohortA relapse prevention , patient MM ( normal- high-risk ) receive induction therapy subsequent AHCT . - For Cohort B relapse therapy , patient MM measurable disease least 2 prior treatment regimen . Design : - For Cohort A , patient receive two infusion autologous Th1/Tc1.Rapa cell ( one two month post-AHCT ; infusion precede 7-day course immune modulate chemotherapy [ pentostatin plus low-dose cyclophosphamide ; PC regimen ] . - For Cohort B relapse therapy , patient four infusion Th1/Tc1.Rapa cell , infusion precede either 7-day 14-day PC regimen .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : MULTIPLE MYELOMA CRITERIA : Criteria Cohort A ( recently diagnose subject ; receive AHCT ) : Must presence clonal plasma cell bone marrow great equal 10 % biopsy proven plasmacytoma Must either : 1. presence Mcomponent ( IgG IgA ) serum great equal 1g/dl urine great equal 200 mg/24 h ; 2. presence abnormal serum free light chain ( FLC ) ratio serum FLC assay . Criteria Cohort B ( multiply relapse multiple myeloma ) : Must measurable MM , define : serum Mprotein great euqal 1 g/dL , urine Mprotein great equal 200 mg/24 hour , involve serum free light chain ( FLC ) level great equal 10 mg/dL , biopsy proven plasmacytoma , 30 % bone marrow plasma cell . Must receive least 2 different treatment regimen MM . Other eligibility criterion ( applies Cohort A Cohort B , unless specify ) : Age great equal 18 year less equal 75 year . In subject 65 75 year age , physiologic age comorbidity thoroughly evaluate enrol . Specifically , history cardiovascular pathology symptom , clearly fit exclusion criterion prompt evaluation Clinical Center Cardiologist eligibility consider casebycase basis . For Cohort A , highdose chemotherapy AHCT must plan ; amendment K , posttransplant maintenance therapy permit . Karnofsky performance status 70 % great . Lower KPS 50 % may acceptable restriction activity solely due intractable pain myeloma lesion . Ejection fraction ( EF ) MUGA 2D echocardiogram within institution normal limit . In case low EF , subject may remain eligible stress echocardiogram perform EF 35 % increase EF stress estimate 10 % . Serum creatinine less equal 2.5 mg/dl , AST ALT less equal 3 time upper limit normal , Bilirubin less equal to1.5 ( except due Gilbert 's disease ) . Corrected DLCO great equal 50 % Pulmonary Function Tests No history abnormal bleeding tendency predisposition repeat infection . Patients must able give informed consent EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation Hypertension adequately control 3 less medication . History cerebrovascular accident within 6 month enrollment.. History document pulmonary embolus within 6 month enrollment . Clinically significant cardiac pathology : myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment , Class III IV heart failure accord NYHY , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Patients history coronary artery bypass graft angioplasty receive cardiology evaluation consider casebycase basis . HIV seropositive Patients know find pregnant unwilling stop breastfeeding.. Patients childbearing age unwilling practice contraception mean avoid pregnancy . Patients may exclude discretion PI deem allow participation would represent unacceptable medical psychiatric risk .</criteria>
