	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study side effect well Akt inhibitor MK2206 everolimus work treat patient kidney cancer respond treatment . Akt inhibitor MK2206 everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Everolimus may also stop growth kidney cancer block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether Akt inhibitor MK2206 everolimus effective treat kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Akt Inhibitor MK2206 Everolimus Treating Patients With Refractory Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression free survival ( PFS ) vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) therapy refractory renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) patient receive either MK-2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK-2206 ) everolimus . II . To assess safety MK-2206 patient VEGF therapy refractory RCC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall response rate ( ORR ) overall survival ( OS ) . ( Clinical ) II . To assess time treatment failure ( TTF ) . ( Clinical ) III . To determine whether baseline AKT activation predictive clinical benefit treatment MK-2206 everolimus . ( Pre-clinical/exploratory ) IV . To determine whether circulate cytokine angiogenic factor predict clinical benefit treatment MK-2206 everolimus . ( Pre-clinical/exploratory ) V. To assess impact karyotype outcome patient treat MK-2206 everolimus . ( Pre-clinical/exploratory ) OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients progression free 1 year may receive 12 week study drug supply Akt inhibitor MK2206 . ARM II : Patients receive everolimus PO daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
