	<brief_summary>The treatment lymphedema major focus attention physicians scientist several decade . At time , successful technique develop prevent lymphedema , therefore , great deal emphasis place treatment modality lessen severity impede progression debilitate condition . The treatment offer usually consist maintenance phase use compression garment intensive treatment phase , include use skin care , compression bandaging , exercise manual lymphatic drainage ( MLD ) . The intensive phase usually describe complex decongestive therapy ( CDT ) . This time consume require high resource usage . Pneumatic compression device ( PCD ) offer alternative MLD use patient . There number device market categorize 1. without calibrate gradient compression 2 . With calibrated gradient compression . This trial compare two PCDs , simple device without calibrated compression , advanced device calibrate compression , reduction swell maintenance reduce limb volume 262 patient low limb lymphoedema . The primary end point limb volume reduction 12 week treatment , secondary outcome 24 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Multicentre , prospective , single ( assessor ) blind randomise study . The primary objective study ass volume reduction treatment lymphoedematous leg advance PCD compare simple PCD patient low limb lymphoedema . The main outcome percentage volume reduction affect limb end treatment compare baseline . Secondary objective study Assessment safety Quality life Health economic parameter In total 262 patient leg lymphoedema enrol study . Patients eligible study suffer late stage II stage III accord International Society Lymphology lymphoedema stag . Lymphoedematous legs primary secondary origin uni bilaterally affect . Medical history take baseline . Patients taught use device randomise . Visits take place week 1,4,8,12 24 week . The device use 60 minute day trial limb . At visit sequential circumference affect unaffected limb measure tape measure . All adverse event document . At begin end study quality life questionnaires health economic information complete patient . At Derby site assessment tissue quality make use ultrasound moisture meter ass tissue fluid .</detailed_description>
