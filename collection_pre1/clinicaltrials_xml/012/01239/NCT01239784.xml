	<detailed_description>Neurodevelopmental deficit common morbidity among child receive surgical treatment complex congenital heart defect infancy . Over 40 % child complex heart defect neurodevelopmental deficit persist throughout childhood even successful surgical procedure infancy1 . These deficit typically related basic motor perceptual motor visual motor skill . Problems integrate see ( visual perception ) body movement ( motor skill ) make difficult child participate peer play limit ability succeed school , thereby significant impact child 's quality life . Traditional , therapist-delivered rehabilitation programme address delays neurodevelopment previously attempt . It would difficult provide direct rehabilitation program patient give defect rare patient locate within geographical area . Home-based , parent-delivered rehabilitation program previously show effective improve motor skill school-age child complex heart defects5 . Since home-based parent deliver model would enable participation infant regardless geographic location , feasibility use model deliver neurodevelopmental rehabilitation investigate .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Families eligible participate study child : Had arterial switch operation ( transposition great artery ) Glenn procedure ( functional single ventricle ) . Is medically stable normal infant activity . Is 12 24 month age January 2010 . Families exclude study participation : The child recognize syndrome disability affect neurodevelopment . The child medical procedure 3 month precede baseline study assessment . The cardiologist responsible child 's care refuse allow child 's participation . The child performs substantially ageappropriate developmental milestone initial assessment ( case intervention unlikely detectable additional benefit ) .</criteria>
