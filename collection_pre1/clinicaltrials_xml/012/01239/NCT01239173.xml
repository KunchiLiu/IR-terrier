	<detailed_description>Post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) type anxiety disorder 's trigger extremely traumatic event . Traumatic event may trigger PTSD include violent personal assault , accident , natural human-caused disaster , military combat . Converging line evidence implicate amygdala pathophysiology posttraumatic stress disorder . Initially base animal study , idea memory emotional material human modulate noradrenergic system amygdala , receive strong support last decade . Evidence mainly come study investigate effect emotion encode process ( Mc GAUGH , 2000 ) . In view , propranolol use somewhat successfully shortly trauma reduce development PTSD symptom ( Pitman et al. , 2002 ; VAIVA et al. , 2003 ) . As already mention , `` reconsolidation '' study develop rat provide treatment strategy use long PTSD induction . Recent evidence indicate consolidated long-term memory human also influence event deliver memory reactivation ( Walker et al. , 2003 ; HUPBACH et al. , 2007 ) , suggest human memory retroactively alter treatment deliver conjunction memory reactivation . This seem confirm yet unpublished human base study suggest propranolol may impair reconsolidation condition fear-response ( Miller et al. , 2004 ) The primary purpose study assess effect propanolol , beta adrenergic antagonism , amygdala activation symptom provocation state traumatize subject without posttraumatic stress disorder . One Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) perform ( week 1 ) 32 patient PTSD 32 control ( exposure traumatic event without PTSD ) examine amygdala activation provocation state . One half patient PTSD one half control receive propranolol prior fMRI double blind condition . In addition , cognitive test battery perform ( screen , week 0 , 1 , 2 ) fRMI acquisition follow visit .</detailed_description>
