	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine anti-thymocyte globulin ( Thymoglobuline ) administration kidney transplant recipient able reduce amount damage kidney transplant deceased donor sustain reperfusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thymoglobulin Induction Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The increase disparity organ availability number patient wait list transplant lead different strategy improve half life transplant . One method reduce amount damage organ sustain period preservation reperfusion recipient . Thymoglobulin , anti-lymphocyte antibody show ability reduce damage experimental study . This study aim ascertain role Thymoglobulin kidney transplant donor cardiac death , type kidney transplant high risk sustain injury preservation . The study involve comparison conventional immunosuppressant therapy , comparison Thymoglobulin administer different dos , observation pattern blood cell repopulation ( lymphocytes mainly ) first year follow kidney transplantation .</detailed_description>
