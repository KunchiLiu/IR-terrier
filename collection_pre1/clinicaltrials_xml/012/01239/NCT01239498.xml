	<brief_title>Saline Injection - Assisted Anesthesia Eyelid Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : To carry prospective randomise control clinical trial compare efficacy saline injection prior injection Lidocaine/Adrenaline reduce pain local anaesthetic injection upper eyelid . Hypothesis : Injection saline upper eyelid prior lidocaine/adrenaline injection reduces pain anaesthetic injection upper eyelid surgery . Justification : In many surgical procedure perform local anaesthetic , frighten painful aspect procedure patient anaesthetic injection , various technique advocate address . Simple measure reduce pain anaesthetic injection widely practise include administer injection slowly use fine-bore needle ( 30 Gauge ) . Other technique show effective include warm buffer local anaesthetic . The use 0.9 % bacteriostatic saline solution conjunction lidocaine demonstrate significantly reduce patient ' perceive pain injection operative procedure eyelid surgery . Cooling skin immediately prior treatment show reduce pain dermatological laser procedure although might difficult perform around eye risk injure cornea . Similarly , topical anaesthetic agent , EMLA ( eutectic mixture local anaesthetic ) cream , apply skin one hour prior injection commonly employ use limbs infant child safe use around eye since inadvertent ocular application cause corneal de-epithelisation . Sedative agent , midazolam may useful anxious patient , require input anaesthetist often difficult finely control level sedation ; usually preferable patient sedate eyelid surgery patient cooperation require intra-operatively assess height eyelid , example ptosis surgery . The investigator notice clinical practice whenever investigator inject saline upper eyelid prior injection mixture lidocaine/adrenaline patient report pain . The investigator assume use isotonic saline cell tissue harm minor effect anesthesia achieve . The anesthetic solution inject later dilute , however eyelid properly anesthesized . Research Methods : The study prospective , interventional , randomise , control clinical trial . All patient fit inclusion criterion offer participation trial day surgery book . They give information leaflet trial , explain aim study without describe effect saline injection prior anesthetic solution injection order reduce risk bias perception . They advise non-participation affect care anyway . The intervention risk patient affect surgical procedure way . Any question patient address beforehand require sign consent form prior inclusion trial . They advise beforehand require verbally rate pain score scale 0 10 immediately side anaesthetise , 0 pain 10 bad imaginable pain . All participant include study undergo bilateral surgery therefore act control : Saline inject prior injection anaesthetic one side . The test placebo randomly assign either first second eyelid ; right eyelid inject first patient , routine practice . Computer-generated sequential binary randomisation use . Allocation conceal surgeon immediately prior anaesthetic injection . All anaesthetic injection consist xylocaine 1 % 1:100,000 adrenaline administer short 30 Gauge needle constant slow speed multiple ( 6-7 ) sit along upper lid single oculoplastic consultant . Patients ' verbal pain score elicit document immediately oculoplastic fellow . Planned sample size On scale 0 10 difference pain score 1.5 may consider clinically significant . The power calculation pair t-test 90 % power p=0.05 demonstrate sample size 80 patient sufficient detect significant difference . The result submit publication peer-reviewed ophthalmological journal presentation international ophthalmological meeting .</detailed_description>
