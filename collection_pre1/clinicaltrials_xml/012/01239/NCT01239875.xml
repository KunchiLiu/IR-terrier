	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines , dendritic cell therapy ( DC ) make person 's tumor cell white blood cell may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Cryosurgery kill cancer cell freeze . Giving vaccine therapy together cryosurgery may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study give vaccine therapy together without cryosurgery treat patient B-cell Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With Without Cryosurgery Treating Patients With Residual , Relapsed , Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluation safety tolerability measure incidence significant toxicity autologous DC vaccine injection cryoablated tumor site ( Arm A ) . II . Evaluation safety tolerability measure incidence significant toxicity autologous mature DC vaccine + tumor lysate generate vitro deliver intradermally ( ID ) ( Arm B ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . For cryoablation candidate : To assess feasibility , overall response rate , clinical benefit rate , time response , duration response ( Arm A ) . II . For patient receive ID vaccine without cryoablation : To assess feasibility , clinical response rate , time response , duration response ( Arm B ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . For cryoablation candidate : To assess change time non-cryoablated node select index lesion ( Arm A ) . II . For patient receive ID vaccine without cryoablation : To assess change time measurable node select index lesion ( Arm B ) . III . To monitor patient ' immune response vaccine therapy . IV . Assess immune response Prevnar cancer patient . V. Assess effect DC vaccination presence myeloid suppressor . VI . Assess effect tumor antigen delivery method ( vivo DC cryoablated tumor vs. ID injection vitro generate DC + lysate ) T cell response . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2.5 year .</detailed_description>
