	<brief_summary>Stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) technique use deliver radiation , sit body . All participant study treat SBRT use proton beam radiation . Proton beam radiation use tiny particle deliver radiation tumor . The purpose research study determine SBRT proton prevent tumor growth reduce treatment side effect liver metastasis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Participants receive SBRT proton , receive radiation treatment outpatient Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center Massachusetts General Hospital . - Not everyone participate study receive dose radiation . The dose receive determined size location tumor ( ) . - Participants receive 2-3 SBRT treatment per week two week . - During radiation therapy visit follow tests/procedures perform : vital sign , physical examination , routine blood test , research blood test , radiation planning . - Follow-up assessment perform 9 week study treatment , 6 month , 12 month , 18 month 24 month treatment .</detailed_description>

Extrahepatic disease allow stable 3 month prior study entry , dominant disease burden intrahepatic patient refer definitive radiation therapy disease liver Measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension 10mm great spiral CT scan Patients may prior chemotherapy , target biological therapy , surgery , transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) , radiofrequency ablation , cryosurgery disease long prior therapy occur great 3 week elapse first radiation treatment . Patients may prior liver direct radiation , include radioembolization . 18 year age older Expected survival must great three month ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 Patients must least 800mL uninvolved liver Normal organ marrow function outline protocol If patient underlying cirrhosis , ChildPugh classification Group A patient include study . Clinical assessment ascites encephalopathy require . ChildPugh classification must determine study participant time eligibility analysis . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry duration study participation Women pregnant lactating Patients gross ascites encephalopathy Local condition systemic illness would reduce local tolerance radiation treatment , serious local injury , active collagen vascular disease , etc . Prior liver direct radiation treatment , include selective internal radiation No serious medical illness , may limit survival less 3 month No serious psychiatric illness would limit compliance treatment Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 3 week prior start study treatment recover adverse event due agent administer 3 week earlier Participants may receive investigational agent , anticancer therapy treatment Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia . Only solid tumor permit . Thus , individual liver mass diagnosis lymphoma leukemia exclude</criteria>
