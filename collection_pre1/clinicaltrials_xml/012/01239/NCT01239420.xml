	<detailed_description>Cardiac arrest ( CA ) lead cause death , affect 700.000 individual year Europe . Acute Myocardial Infarction ( AMI ) primary arrhythmia common cause CA , whereas respiratory arrest lead cause secondary CA . Patients undergone cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) often remain unconscious hospital admission , either result severe permanent brain damage merely reversible metabolic disturbance due post-ischemic global reperfusion . Early prediction neurological cardiac outcome remain difficult task physician . The decision continue , limit terminate intensive care therapy carry huge ethical socioeconomic implication . Optimal emergency cardiovascular care , cardiac failure therapy CA prevention hospitalisation also remain difficult issue cardiologist intensive care doctor . In prospective study run 2010 , prognostication in-hospital treatment study population 150-250 patient out-of-hospital cardio-respiratory arrest . The use combine clinical-neurological , neurophysiologic , neuroradiological biochemical marker study asses whether poor neurological outcome ( Cerebral Performance Category 3-5 ) predict ~100 % specificity sensitivity sufficient practical clinical use . Pre-disposing trigger cause cardiorespiratory arrest also register . Patients pre-existing condition coherent prophylactic ICD implementation current international guideline identify , order ass improve ICD-prophylactic treatment Norway . The potential benefit invasive PICCO-monitoring CA also evaluate , subproject identify biomarkers CA risk establish . NIRS ( Near-Infrared spectroscopy ) also use register cerebral oxygenation early day cardiorespiratory arrest . The overall aim NORCAST study provide physician well tool asses cardiac neurological outcome early accurate possible .</detailed_description>
