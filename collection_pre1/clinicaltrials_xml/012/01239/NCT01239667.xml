	<detailed_description>Rehabilitation people serious illness , focus last 10-15 year also valid heart field ( 1 ) . The focus cardiac rehabilitation efficacy treatment relation mortality , morbidity health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) . Purpose rehabilitation : `` Rehabilitation target time-bound collaborative process individual , relatives professional . The aim citizen risk significant limitation physical , mental / social functioning , achieve independent meaningful life . Rehabilitation base citizen 's whole life situation decision make coordinate , coherent , knowledge-based action ( 1 ) . Background . Worldwide , estimate around . 50 million people suffer heart disease ( 2 ) . In Denmark assume 60,000 people live chronic heart failure , prevalence increase increase age ( 3 ) ( 4 ) . In 2005 142,245 hospitalization cardiovascular disease Denmark , 86,336 people , 1,786 per 100,000 men 1,409 per 100,000 woman . Viewed isolation heart-related death period 1998 -2005 decrease mortality general , 30 day mortality AMI decrease 10 4 % ( 5 ) . Cardiac rehabilitation make traditional hospital setting documented effect effort term patient ' physical function , decrease relapse disease , decrease morbidity mortality ( 2 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) ( 9 ) . Hypothesis objectives study Hypothesis : Systematic preparation rehabilitation plan Phase III base identification self care behavior patient heart failure NYHA class II III , lead patient ' self-care behavior strengthen , result improve health status ADL level 6 month discharge hospital heart failure . Target 1 . To develop evidence-based protocol patient rehabilitation phase III 2 . To test effect individual rehabilitation plan base evidence-based knowledge patient rehabilitation Phase III . Efficacy evaluate relation change self-care behavior , health status ADL function . Materials method . 3.1 Population : Patients recruit Zealand Region Hospital South Naestved Slagelse . There print annually 55-60 patient heart failure respective hospital . The material study woman men heart failure NYHA class II - III participant calculate base strength calculation . Inclusion : Patients NYHA II-III Participation happen write informed consent . Patients include respective intervention control group depend hospital site . Exclusion : Patients wish participate . Patients language communication impedes Sufficient participation . Patients understand information , well patient diagnose neurological deficit . Calculation sample size : Calculation patient number base strength calculation . The level type 1 error set 5 % type 2 error 20 % , expect improvement ADL level 50 % , Power Calculation show participate 60 patient control 60 patient intervention group ( http : / / statpages.org / proppowr.html ) . With expect dropout rate 25 % , therefore , invite 72 patient group Design . quasi experimental study patient Regions Hospital Naestved hospital Slagelse . Each intervention patient receive end hospital rehabilitation design specific rehabilitation plan also contact patient specially trained nurse telephone 4 12 week completion rehabilitation hospital patient opportunity contact department need . The effect rehabilitation assess send questionnaire SF 36 EHFScB Scale 9 ( 36 ) ass patient ' ADL functioning , self-care behavior self-rated health . Patients include experimental control group . Randomization blind possible since staff resource sufficient enable staff contact respective intervention control patient . All patient participate plan rehabilitation hospital , baseline end Phase II . Intervention base analysis individual 's need continue rehabilitation ( selfcare behavior , health status , ADL function ) patient 's perception situation . Draw plan program together patient . The program must tailor individual patient 's possibility . The program supply guides patient . The patient acknowledge copy plan physician home care . Furthermore , patient contact specially trained nurse telephone 4 12 week initiation phase III rehabilitation , provide telephone support structure interview guide . Patients also opportunity outside agree time contact specialist nurse . Variables : Demographic data , sex , age , live alone , dependent / independent help others , diagnosis , status job , comorbidities , NYHA class NYHA classification carry specialist discharge hospital transition rehabilitation Self-Care Behavior ADL function , estimate use European Heart Failure Self-Care Behavior Scale . The instrument translate face validate pilot test use . The test measure patient ' ability ass situation ability act observation make ( 36 ) . Health Status Assessed Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ) . The form generic cover patient 's perception health . SF-36 translate Danish validate ( 37 ) . SF-36 include 36 question self-assessment health status include eight specific area : physical functioning , physical constraint , pain , general health , energy / fatigue , social functioning , psychological constraint psychological wellbeing . For eight strand transformed response interval scale 0-100 0 indicates impairment full restriction 100 indicate full function restriction . Process variable : compliance nursing program examine self-reported data . Statistical analysis : Data analyze statistical program SPSS . Ratio-scaled data two group test F test MHP . distribution . For normally distribute data compare use parametric method ( test ) , otherwise non-parametric method ( Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test ) . Nominal Scale Data compare chi-square test use 95 % confidence interval . The project report Data Inspectorate . Furthermore , experiment report local Research Ethics Committee , www.Clinicaltrials.gov right project ensure .</detailed_description>
