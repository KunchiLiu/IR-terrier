	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - To determine dose SAR240550 study combination chemotherapy regimens Secondary Objectives : - To determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) SAR240550 SAR240550 combination chemotherapy regimen ( gemcitabine carboplatin - To assess safety profile : significant laboratory change adverse event ( AEs ) - To make preliminary assessment antitumor effect study subject per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) measurable disease - To characterize SAR240550 metabolite , 4-iodo-3-amino benzamide ( IABM ) 4-iodo-3-amino-benzoic acid ( IABA ) , pharmacokinetics - To collect blood sample glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) genotypes baseline ) Based data generate BiPar/Sanofi , conclude iniparib posse characteristic typical PARP inhibitor class . The exact mechanism yet fully elucidate , however base experiment tumor cell perform laboratory , iniparib novel investigational anti-cancer agent induces gamma-H2AX ( marker DNA damage ) tumor cell line , induces cell cycle arrest G2/M phase tumor cell line , potentiates cell cycle effect DNA damage modality tumor cell line . Investigations potential target iniparib metabolite ongoing .</brief_summary>
