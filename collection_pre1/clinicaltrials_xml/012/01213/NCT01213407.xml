	<detailed_description>Vaccination represent success story modern medicine principle find valid different specie , least case infectious disease . As today , little reason believe would true case tumour . It generally acknowledge human tumour carry mutational antigenic ( non-self ) repertoire immunogenic potential may suitable target antitumour immune therapy . During last year accumulate evidence mouse experiment indicate one immunise prophylactically cancer effectively infectious agent . However , contrast experimental mouse tumour model , human tumours general within host long time thus opportunity influence microenvironment large immunological environment . Antigens capable mediate specific rejection find human well mouse tumour . Many clinical trial use dendritic cell ( DC ) -based cancer vaccination technique design treatment melanoma . Other important disease DC-based cancer vaccination study include prostate cancer , B cell lymphoma , renal cell carcinoma , glioma glioblastoma , breast ovarian cancer , gastrointestinal cancer , select solid paediatric tumour . In trial vivo and/or vitro evidence generation anti-tumour immunity find even complete partial remission tumour observe select case . The first phase III trial demonstrate efficacy DC cancer vaccination treatment prostate cancer report recently ( www.dendreon.com ) . Also patient suffer glioblastoma multiforme appear benefit DC cancer immune therapy . The side effect observe DC cancer vaccination usually describe mild limit application . We develop DC cancer vaccine technology , Trivax , advance design DC cancer immune therapy one critical aspect . It first vaccine enable release immune modulatory cytokine interleukin ( IL ) -12 . Trivax comprise IL-12 secrete DCs mixture protein tumour antigen derive individual patient 's tumour cell . No synthetic tumour antigen component involve . Both component Trivax derive individual patient use treatment patient . Trivax therefore represent fully individualise somatic cell therapy medicine . Trimed 's early clinical evaluation patient suffer kidney cancer , prostate cancer , bone tumour , malignancy childhood confirm safety feasibility Trivax technology . Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) ( ICD-O M9440/3 ) malignant astrocytic tumour , compose poorly differentiate neoplastic astrocyte . Histopathological feature include cellular polymorphism , nuclear atypia , brisk mitotic activity , vascular thrombosis , micro-vascular proliferation necrosis . GBM typically affect patient various age begin childhood high age . It preferentially locate cerebral hemisphere . GBM may develop diffuse astrocytomas WHO grade II anaplastic astrocytomas ( secondary GBM ) , frequently , manifest short clinical history de novo , without evidence less malignant precursor lesion ( primary GBM ) . In spite modern oncological treatment , prognosis GBM remain dismal , median survival little 1 year . GBM-Vax randomise , open-label , 2-arm , multi-centre , phase II clinical study group undergo surgery receive standard therapy Temozolomide radiotherapy ; treatment group addition standard therapy receive cancer immune therapy Trivax . Our aim extend therapy option presently include surgery , irradiation Temozolomide DC cancer vaccination improve poor prognosis patient GBM . Primary objective • Progression free survival measure percentage non-progressive patient newly diagnose GBM 12 month post-operative MRI scan treat accord current standard ( surgical resection , irradiation , oral chemo-therapy Temozolomide ) , Trivax , autologous DC cancer vaccine charge autologous tumour protein , add-on therapy ( group A ) , comparison patient receive standard treatment without Trivax ( group B ) . Secondary objective - Progression free survival measure percentage non-progressive patient newly diagnose GBM 18 24 month post-operative MRI scan receive standard treatment Trivax add-on therapy ( group A ) , comparison patient receive standard treatment without Trivax ( group B ) . - Extension overall survival patient newly diagnose GBM receive standard treatment Trivax add-on therapy , comparison patient receive standard treatment without Trivax . - Quality life patient treat Trivax add-on therapy use ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) performance status compare qual-ity life patient receive standard therapy ( study patient older 18 year ) . Number subject In total , 56 patient enrol study . The study consist 2 arm least 28 patient randomly assign one two arm . It expect recruit study patient within period one year . Randomisation base stratification accord study sit 1:1 ratio . Patients young 18 year randomise receive add-on therapy Trivax . We feel would expect child understand accept new treatment available every second patient receive . Obviously , patient young 18 year analyse together adult patient context study ; paediatric patient count towards recruit number 2 x 28 . Thus , result obtain paediatric GBM patient influence outcome study patient older 18 year .</detailed_description>
