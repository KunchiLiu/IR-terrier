	<detailed_description>Individuals new-onset severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy retinal neovascularization present retinal service UBC/VGH Eye Care Centre offer participation study . Subject inclusion criterion parallel DRS ( Diabetic Retinopathy Study ) ETDRS ( Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ) . One PRP session consist 800 1000 laser burn . Subjects discomfort laser ( know side-effect ) treat local anesthetic . As noted , participate subject receive PRP accord present standard care ; however , subject randomize either 10-day course oral Trientine 1500mg administer 7-days prior 3 day PRP session , placebo . Serum copper level urinary copper level evaluate Trientine administration determine amount free copper present systemically time PRP treatment . Ocular outcome include visual acuity testing ( ETDRS ) , fluorescein angiography ocular coherence tomography ( OCT ) . These study use evaluate retinal morphology photoreceptor function pre post laser . All evaluation consider part routine evaluation diabetic retinopathy subject treat PRP . Outcome measure assess day 2-post laser , week 1 , Day 28-30 . Further clinical PRP treatment administer necessary Day 28-30 discretion patient ' ophthalmologist . The primary analysis involve compare retinal thickness measurement subject undergoing PRP without Trientine use . Secondary analysis involve evaluation visual acuity fluorescein angiography . As well , change visual acuity , angiographic leakage , retinal thickness regress serum copper level . Sample size calculation suggest 15 subject per arm adequate demonstrate 40 % reduction retinal thickness power 80 % compare subject receive Trientine control . Subjects randomize Trientine receive 1500 mg Trientine PO daily 10 day . Subjects , study-coordinators , investigator mask treatment group . The primary analysis comparison OCT thickness measurement . This single centre study involve 30 subject ( 15 case 15 control ) . A 1:1 randomization employ ( Trientine 1500 mg : Placebo ) . No normal subject enrol .</detailed_description>
