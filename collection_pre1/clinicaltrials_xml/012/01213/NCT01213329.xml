	<brief_summary>The purpose study check T B cell immune system 50 newly transplant patient receive kidney ( 50 recipient 50 donor total 100 anticipated participant ) . This do see Standard Care ( SOC ) anti-rejection medication , Alemtuzumab ( Campath 1-H® ) affect cells- Campath 1-H® reduces number T cell produce one 's body . We look cell use number laboratory test ; It require subject give 65mL blood 3 visit occur phase 1 . Up 12 subject choose phase 1 participate phase 2 depend lab result . In phase 2 , subject randomize one three follow group : Group one : Continue normal immunosuppression tacrolimus Cellcept® ( control group ) Group two : Cellcept® taper 70 % three month . Tacrolimus continue dosage . Group three : Tacrolimus reduce 70 % three month . Cellcept® continue dosage . There analysis cell different time point , pre post kidney transplant . The data collection allow u study stability time particular phenotype ( cell structure ) T cell function . We also evaluate two different `` minimizing protocol '' effect cell structure . Results laboratory testing may allow u define certain criterion broadly apply solid organ transplant recipient . This may allow safe reduction anti-rejection medication transplant recipient receive .</brief_summary>
