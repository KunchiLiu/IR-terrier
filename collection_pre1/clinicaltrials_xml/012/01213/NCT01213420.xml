If suit study ( = two equal donor site ) inform consent , patient observe start day skin prelevation . A coded file make patient file contain localization donor site , depth determine set dermatome treatment . Treatment donor site always equal . The date wound heal donor site , may differ maximum five day , note . Digital photograph heal donor site take scar evaluate local researcher use Adapted Vancouver Scar Scale prior start hydration . From moment one donor site treat Aruba Aloe formula F-BC-096 one control product apply second site . Per group five patient per centre different control product apply second donor site .
