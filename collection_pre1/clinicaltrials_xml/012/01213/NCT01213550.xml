	<detailed_description>Failure perform oral hygiene adequately gingival margin result formation pathogenic plaque potential initiate gingivitis individual progress periodontitis . However , factor , dexterity motivation , limit effectiveness daily self-performed oral hygiene . The use chemical plaque-inhibitory mouthrinse adjunct toothbrushing may improve oral health individual inadequate mechanical plaque control maintain gingival health . Chlorhexidine ( CHX ) effectively use treatment gingival inflammation consider gold standard oral antiseptic . The effectiveness CHX reduce formation dental plaque prevent gingivitis addition professional mechanical debridement study several clinical study , limited number study investigate effect CHX untreated gingivitis subgingival microbiota .</detailed_description>
