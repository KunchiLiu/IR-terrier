	<detailed_description>Background Cardiovascular disease belong major cause mortality western population . Atherosclerosis arterial system may result ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) peripheral artery disease possible fatal consequence acute myocardial infarction stroke . Atherosclerosis chronic slowly grow pathological lesion remain asymptomatic clinical event occur . In pre-clinical stage atherosclerosis may difficult diagnose . As disease surrogate , large number risk factor atherosclerosis recognize . Some responsible epidemiologically serious metabolic syndrome , account development hyperlipidemia ( preventive point view 25 % population normal blood lipid level ) , obesity , diabetes arterial hypertension . In condition , oxidative stress represent substantial pathogenic factor deleterious chemical reaction damage biomolecules , include formation atherogenic- oxidatively-modified LDL particle ( 1 ) direct destruction cell tissue free radical ( 2-4 ) . Lifestyle , particular dietary scheme , belongs important factor contribute formation development atherosclerosis . The usefulness dietary component contribute low cardiovascular mortality population mediterranean basin well recognize . After pioneer study Ancel Keys ( 5 ) , Mediterranean diet become popular worldwide health diet . Several component diet advocate contribute counteract atherosclerosis , include panel antioxidant unsaturated fatty acid . Health provider continental diet-based country suggest embrace Mediterranean diet order contribute reduce cardiovascular mortality . However , country Mediterranean area experience shift dietary habit towards continental diet potential harmful change mortality rate . Recently , Trichopoulou et al . ( 6 ) report adherence mediterranean diet survival Greek population . These author find adherence diet associate significant reduction mortality . Italy challenge lifestyle dietary habit issue drift already cause increase obesity prevalence child . Paradoxically , much high south Italy expect strictly associate mediterranean style . It know , however , component Mediterranean diet act protectively organism . It suggest certain component diet may importantly affect oxidative stress ( 7 ) thereby also occurrence cardiovascular ( 8 ) tumor disease ( 9 ) . There also interest data relation regional dietary habit diet composition , occurrence cardiovascular disease . From point view Mediterranean region seem exemplary . Low incidence cardiovascular disease demonstrate already 50´s spite relatively high fat intake , whose major source , however , olive oil rich monounsaturated fatty acid antioxidant polyphenolic compound 12 ( 10 ) . Mediterranean diet prove also control study mark protective effect development cardiovascular disease ( 11 , 12 ) , also total mortality ( 6 ) probably action antioxidant substance increase total antioxidant capacity ( 13 ) . The role dietary factor total antioxidant status describe numerous study , show marked increase antioxidant potential administration vitamin A ( 14 ) , vitamin C ( 15 ) , tomatoes tomato product contain high amount antioxidative terpen lycopene lycopene together olive oil ( 16 ) . On hand , emerge previously unrecognized product lipid metabolism may profound effect metabolic syndrome potentially induction diabetes . Palmitoleate recognize adipose-tissue derive lipid hormone strongly stimulate muscle insulin action suppress hepatosteatosis ( 17 ) . If palmitoleate act lipid hormone human know . In human , fatty acid demonstrate altered clinical condition opposite obesity . In fact , cystic fibrosis patient , usually malnourish , detected increase saturate monounsaturated fatty acid ( 18 ) decrease n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid . C24:0 positively correlate BMI , plasma cholesterol vitamin E , significantly negatively correlate oxysterols.Taken together , data possibly identifies C24:0 indicator adequate nutriture , couple observation C24:0 level reduce patient pancreatic insufficiency . A comprehensive study oxidative stress , include free radical-driven product protective antioxidant , fatty acid metabolism never report healthy subject . In particular , high sensitive mass-spectrometry method study oxidative stress fatty acid metabolism rarely applied epidemiological study . The aim present grant project therefore assess large cross-sectional study prevalence oxidative stress marker , fatty acid find causal relation variable metabolic syndrome . This population sample follow prospectively study metabolic variable relation development oxidative stress-mediated disease , particular cardiovascular system , longitudinal basis ( prospective epidemiological study least 10 year ) . At time able define importance individual marker oxidative stress fatty acid early detection disease . During time propose project , want examine , 500 healthy subject divide decade group range 20-60 year group 60 year . To identify healthy cohort among blood donor . Blood donor request healthy condition devoid cardiovascular risk factor , include metabolic syndrome . Subjects inform detail study proposal accord ethic principle prior enrollment sign inform consent . In examined subject detailed medical history take special interest disease cardiovascular system risk factor atherosclerosis . A complete physical exam include basic anthropometric examination ( BMI calculation determination waist circumference ) EKG perform subject . Blood urine collection perform determine specific analytes : 1 . Routine determination - basic biochemistry ( total cholesterol , HDL LDL cholesterol , triglyceride , urea , creatinine , uric acid , glucose , AST , ALT , GMT , ALP , bilirubin ) , 2 . Antioxidant vitamin plasma - vitamin E , include α- γ-tocopherol . 3 . Markers cholesterol oxidation ( 7β-hydroxycholesterol , 7keto-cholesterol ) ( determination GC-MS ) 4 . Markers arachidonate oxidation , F2 isoprostanes ( determination GC-MS ) 5 . Fatty acid profile ( determination GC-MS ) Since random population sample analyze measured variable determine continuous time scale , mention population sample ( 500 subject ) sensitive enough ass relation metabolic syndrome indicator oxidative stress marker lipid metabolism . Epidemiological approach ( analysis stratify data , linear logistic regression , statistical model multipath relation ) use suppress effect confound factor ( e.g . age , smoking , sex ) data interpretation .</detailed_description>
