	<brief_summary>To determine anatomic site offer consistent ( superior ) absorption insulin . To determine injection technique allow consistent subcutaneous injection insulin ( pinch spread ) . Hypothesis : Based age-related change amount subcutaneous fat anticipate absorption insulin various anatomical site differ . Justification : To date health care professional extrapolate data obtain young adult apply result elderly . Objectives : To determine rate insulin absorption different anatomic site diabetic patient age 70 . To determine best practice subcutaneous injection old adult . Research Method : Measurement serial glucose insulin level use 360 minute euglycemic clamp study . Statistical Analysis : Paired test , repeat measure ANOVA</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consist 5 visit UBC VITALiTY Research Centre . At screen visit subject follow information collect : height , weight , blood pressure , heart rate , BMI , medical history concommitant medication . Approximately 15cc blood drawn analyze A1C , CBC platelet , AST , ALT , alk phos , BUN , creatinine , fast blood sugar . The subject undergo 4 euglycemic clamp study least 30 day apart random order . During one study subject receive insulin injection abdomen use pinch technique . In another study subject receive insulin injection use spread technique . During third study subject receive insulin injection deltiod area use pinch technique . During fourth study subject receive insulin injection deltoid use spread technique . Subjects randomly assign study . After injection subject complete questionnaire rate comfort injection . Subjects report Research Centre 0700 fast since midnight night . An intravenous line normal saline place one hand facilitate blood draw . This hand place heat box . A second intravenous insert arm infusion glucose . Prior subcutaneous insulin injection , blood sample collect -30 , -15 , 0 minute . At time 0 subcutaneous injection lispro insulin ( 0.1 u/kg ) administer glucose infusion start . Glucose level measure bedside every 5 min insulin level every 15 min 0-360 min . Glucose infusion adjust maintain glucose level constant level duration study , use glucose clamp protocol .</detailed_description>
