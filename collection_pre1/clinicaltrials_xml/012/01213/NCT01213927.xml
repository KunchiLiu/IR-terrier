	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) major public health problem , whose incidence increase developed country lead cause death patient cirrhosis . The diagnosis early management key issue could improve prognosis . In France , alcoholic cirrhosis lead cause HCC , aetiology underlie chronic liver disease mainly hepatitis C ( HCV ) Southern Europe Japan , hepatitis B ( HBV ) Asia Africa . In next year , due improve result anti-viral therapy , trend reinforce decrease proportion HCC related viral cirrhosis increase proportion HCC relate alcoholic cirrhosis . However , natural history alcoholic cirrhosis remain poorly understood , study retrospective include small number patient . This project file consortium CIRRAL include French Academic hospital center currently involve referee field alcoholic liver disease HCC ( 8 moment , next month ) . It national multicenter prospective study include 1200 patient alcoholic cirrhosis histologically proven 3 year . The main goal cohort describe natural history large number patient alcoholic cirrhosis prospectively follow , identify predictor occurrence HCC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients select study meet inclusion criterion , without non-inclusion criterion , ie compensate Child Pugh A alcoholic cirrhosis without viral chronic hepatitis B C , without detectable HCC . They offer , consultation part usual care , participate study . An information note issue . Patients agree participate date sign inform consent . Usual biological test liver ultrasonography perform do within 90 day prior inclusion . During visit , 20 ml blood collect freezing storage serum plasma , constitution DNA library . From review conduct baseline , patient least one exclusion criterion ( ie decompensation cirrhosis , Child Pugh score ≥ 7 , co-infection HBV HCV , liver focal lesion suggestive HCC exclude ( serum sample achieve BioBank destroy ) : Monitoring : According current guideline , patient periodical surveillance liver ultrasonography medical consultation least every 6 month , blood test least every year , periodic assessment esophageal gastric varix ( every 1 3 year ) prevention rupture . An additional blood sample 20 ml take baseline every year order perform serum , plasma , DNA libraries ; Data standardize centralize single database . Statistical Analysis : Methods censor data competitive risk . Number subject include : The plan number 1200 subject include 3 year . Assuming minimal annual incidence HCC 2 % patient alcoholic cirrhosis , proportion lose follow-up around 20 % poorly compliant population , sample 3000 patient could demonstrate existence predictive factor occurrence HCC associate relative risk least equal 2 , power 90 % . However , enrollment 3000 patient recruit three year realistic goal . For practical reason since data currently available limited regard precise incidence HCC strength association risk factor HCC patient alcoholic cirrhosis , minimum number patient include cohort CIRRAL set 1200 . Regarding expected percentage patient lose follow close 20 % , final number patient sufficient follow-up 1000 . Expected result 1. description incidence HCC occurrence patient alcoholic cirrhosis ; 2. identification predictive factor occurrence HCC c ) identification prognostic factor survival . In addition , nest scientific project use database collect sample prospective cohort , thus constitute significant saving resource . However , nest scientific project include specific need organization finance clean , may involve fraction population include . The area involve varied ( immunology , genetics , image , evaluation fibrosis , biostatistics , , quality life , economy , etc . ) .</detailed_description>
