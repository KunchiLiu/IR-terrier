	<brief_title>Hepatic Arterial Infusion Oxaliplatin , Capecitabine With Without Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Oxaliplatin design keep new cancer cell grow . Capecitabine design interfere growth cancer cell . Bevacizumab design block growth blood vessel supply nutrient necessary tumor growth . This may prevent slow growth cancer cell . Bevacizumab long FDA approve treat breast cancer . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study `` arm '' base result screen test . All patient receive oxaliplatin capecitabine . If doctor think best interest , also receive bevacizumab . - If Arm 1 , receive oxaliplatin , capecitabine , bevacizumab . - If Arm 2 , receive oxaliplatin capecitabine . Arm 1 : You assign dose level capecitabine base join study . Up 4 dose level capecitabine test . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose capecitabine find . All participant receive dose level oxaliplatin bevacizumab . Arm 2 : You assign dose level capecitabine base join study . Up 4 dose level capecitabine test . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose capecitabine find . All participant receive dose level oxaliplatin . Additionally , high tolerable dose find arm , certain tumor type find respond well study drug combination , 14 participant tumor type receive study drug dose level . In arm , high tolerable dose study drug combination find , 20 extra participant tumor type receive dose level . Additionally , high tolerable dose find arm , certain tumor type find respond well study drug combination , 14 participant tumor type receive study drug dose level . Catheter Placement Study Drug Administration : You hospitalize receive study drug combination . On day admission hospital , catheter ( sterile flexible tube place hepatic artery [ blood vessel liver ] local anesthesia ) receive study drug . The catheter place removed cycle . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form . You must lay bed entire time catheter place . The catheter either remove right chemotherapy may remain overnight . Study Drug Administration : Arm 1 : After completion oxaliplatin bevacizumab , receive total 28 dos capecitabine , 1 dose twice daily . You receive bevacizumab vein 1Â½ hour . The first time receive bevacizumab , give 90 minute . If tolerate well , rest dos give 30-60 minute . On Days 1-14 cycle , take capecitabine mouth 2 time day . You take cup ( 8 ounce ) non-carbonated water within 30 minute meal . Arm 2 : On Day 1 21-day cycle , receive oxaliplatin catheter 2 hour . After completion oxaliplatin bevacizumab , receive total 28 dos capecitabine , 1 dose twice daily . You take cup ( 8 ounce ) non-carbonated water within 30 minute meal . Study Visits : At study visit , ask drug may take side effect may . On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn test blood 's ability clot . - If able become pregnant , urine pregnancy test . At end every even cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , ) : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn test tumor marker . - You scan check status disease . This may include chest x-ray , CT scan , MRI scan , PET scan , and/or PET/CT scan . If study doctor think appropriate , type scan may need perform . Length Study : You may continue take study drug combination long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug combination disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . If disease liver respond treatment , may eligible receive surgery . If eligible , receive surgery 6 week take last dose study drug Arm 1 4 week take last dose study drug Arm 2 . The study doctor discus detail sign separate consent form surgery . Your participation study complete follow-up visit . Follow-Up Visit : About 6 week last dose study drug , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You CT scan , MRI scan , PET scan , PET/CT scan check status disease . If study doctor think best interest , type scan may also perform . This investigational study . Oxaliplatin FDA approve commercially available treatment colorectal cancer . Bevacizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment colorectal lung cancer . Capecitabine FDA approve commercially available treatment colorectal breast cancer . Giving study drug together advance cancer investigational . Up 116 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
