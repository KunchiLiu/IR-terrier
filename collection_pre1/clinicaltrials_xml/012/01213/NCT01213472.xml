	<detailed_description>In study , patient receive maximum 24 dos recNY-ESO-1 + AS15 ASCI accord four cycle period four year . An active follow-phase ( five year registration study ) plan patient . As Amendment 3 , longer active follow-up patient discontinuation completion treatment . The study end 30 day last dose administer . In addition , biological sample collect protocol research purpose . For biological sample already collect scope study test yet , test perform default , except scientific rationale remain relevant . Blood sample safety monitoring per protocol continue .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female patient histologically proven , measurable metastatic cutaneous melanoma , document progressive disease within 12 week first administration study treatment . Written inform consent NYESO1 expression screen gene profile resect tumor tissue complete study obtain patient prior shipment sample expression test prior performance protocolspecific procedure . Patient &gt; = 18 year age time signature inform consent . The patient 's tumor show expression NYESO1 , determine realtime quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RTPCR ) analysis update technique fresh tissue sample ( ) . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 1 . The patient normal organ function show follow : Hemoglobin ≥ 12 g/dL Absolute leukocytes count ≥ 3.0 x 1000000000/L Absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 1.0 x 1000000000/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 1000000000/L Serum creatinine ≤ Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( except patient Gilbert 's syndrome limit 2 x ULN ) Lactate dehydrogenase ≤ ULN Aspartate aminotransferase ≤ 2 × ULN Alanine aminotransferase ≤ 2 × ULN These test must do 3 week first ASCI administration . Female patient nonchildbearing potential may enrol study . Female patient childbearing potential may enrol study , patient : practiced adequate contraception 30 day prior first ASCI administration , negative pregnancy test specify study visit , agree continue adequate contraception entire treatment period 2 month completion ASCI administration series . In view investigator , patient comply requirement protocol . The patient time receive systemic chemotherapy , biochemotherapy , small molecule ntiCTLA4 monoclonal antibody metastatic disease . The patient schedule receive anticancer treatment specify protocol , include limited ( bio ) chemotherapeutic , immunomodulating agent radiotherapy . The patient receive cancer immunotherapy contain NYESO1 antigen cancer immunotherapy his/her metastatic disease . The patient require concomitant treatment systemic corticosteroid , immunosuppressive agent . Use investigational nonregistered product ASCI within 30 day precede first ASCI administration , plan use study period . The patient ( ) previous concomitant malignancy site , except effectively treat nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix effectively treat malignancy remission 5 year highly likely cure . The patient allergy component study investigational product history previous allergic reaction vaccination . The patient autoimmune disease , limited , multiple sclerosis , lupus , inflammatory bowel disease . Patients vitiligo exclude . The patient family history congenital hereditary immunodeficiency . The patient know positive Human Immunodeficiency Virus . The patient uncontrolled bleed disorder . The patient family history congenital hereditary immunodeficiency . The patient psychiatric addictive disorder may compromise his/her ability give inform consent , comply trial procedure . The patient concurrent severe medical problem , unrelated malignancy , would significantly limit full compliance study expose patient unacceptable risk .
