	<brief_summary>Gastric bypass surgery propose effective treatment strategy type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , thus far algorithms management T2DM immediately surgery establish . The investigator design algorithm achieve good glycaemic control patient insulin-requiring T2DM upon discharge gastric bypass surgery , evaluate algorithm feasibility , efficacy , safety .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective randomise control intervention study obese human subject Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus undergo obesity surgery ( n=80 ) . Patients recruit already due undergo bariatric surgery within context obesity clinic ( Imperial College London ) . Patients randomise either two treatment protocol . Protocol A-Conservative Management : On admission hospital pre-operative oral antidiabetic agent insulin stop glucose monitoring carry every four hour time routine observation . Actrapid insulin administer glucose per standard slide scale ( Appendix A ) . Just prior discharge , total insulin administer previous 24 hour post-operative period calculate . Based result ward base glucose monitoring , post-operative patient divide two broad category . The first group include patient able maintain euglycaemia without exogenous insulin administration . These patient discharge home preoperative Metformin dose advise continue monitor fast glucose level home . If fast glucose level le 4 10mmol/l record home , patient encourage contact obesity clinic physician advice . The second group include patient experience hyperglycemic episode immediate post-operative period . These patient discharge home preoperative Metformin dose daily insulin Glargine decide discharge doctor ( base half last 24 hour requirement ) advise continue monitor fast glucose level home . If fast glucose level le 4 10mmol/l record home , patient encourage contact obesity clinic physician advice . Protocol B-Intensive management : On admission hospital pre-operative oral antidiabetic agent insulin stop glucose monitoring carry every four hour time routine observation . Actrapid insulin administer per standard sliding scale ( appendix A ) . Just prior discharge , total insulin administer previous 24 hour post-operative period calculate . Based result ward base glucose monitoring patient discharge home metformin 1000mg BID and/or equivalent amount Glargine insulin requirement previous 24 hour prior discharge . These patient also advise continue glucose monitoring home contact every day medication adjust maintain fast glucose 5 7mmol/l . When consistently achieve investigator stop call , patient encourage continue monitoring blood sugar contact investigator experience problem glycaemic control . Venesection take place 10 day , 3 , 6 12 month post-operatively yearly thereafter fast glucose HbA1c part routine care patient obesity clinic . As part clinical management ensure patient diabetes kidney ( 2 sample morning urine albumin creatinine ratio ) , nerve ( nerve conduction study , include thermal threshold testing ) eye ( retinal photograph ) test within 1 , 2 3 year surgery . These test non invasive except nerve test perform routinely patient diabetes least yearly perform community repeated.Therefore , nerve conduction study , extra burden patient result study .</detailed_description>
