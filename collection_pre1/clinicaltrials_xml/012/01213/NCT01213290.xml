	<brief_summary>Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) become important tool diagnostic evaluation gastrointestinal tract lesion organ sit mediastinal intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy , pancreatic mass , liver mass , leave adrenal mass gastrointestinal submucosal lesion . It provide crucial information tremendous impact patient management . FNA typically perform use 22- 25-gauge needle stylet EUS guidance . The lesion puncture stylet place needle . After withdrawal stylet , needle move fro within lesion process repeat needle pas . It currently believe use stylet EUS-FNA improve quality specimen prevent tip needle clog tissue hence enhances diagnostic yield specimen obtain . However , data demonstrate clearly use stylet improves yield EUS-FNA . The reason question important use stylet EUS-FNA cumbersome , time energy consuming increase cost EUS-FNA needle system . In prospective randomize controlled trial , patient refer EUS-FNA mediastinal intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy , pancreatic mass , liver mass , leave adrenal mass gastrointestinal submucosal tumor include . FNA perform 22-gauge needle EUS guidance use suction 10 mL syringe two experienced endosonographers . The technique use fine needle sample i.e . stylet place without stylet FNA pas assign use preprinted randomization scheme obtain seal envelope clearly document . Each lesion sample minimum four needle pass . The pathologist provide final interpretation blind technique EUS-FNA ( without stylet ) . The degree cellularity , contamination , amount blood , adequacy sample , frequency positive diagnosis make compare two group ( EUS-FNA stylet vs. EUS-FNA without stylet ) . The sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , positive predictive value negative predictive value technique compare final diagnosis calculate . Inter-observer agreement among cytopathologists assess specimen obtain EUS-FNA stylet obtain EUS-FNA without stylet .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial Of Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Fine-Needle Aspiration With And Without A Stylet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Various technique describe optimize accuracy , efficiency , quality EUS-FNA specimen . FNA typically perform use 22- 25-gauge needle stylet EUS guidance . The lesion puncture stylet place slightly withdraw needle . After puncture , stylet push needle tip needle move fro within lesion process repeat needle pas . It currently believe use stylet EUS-FNA help prevent clog needle gut wall tissue , could limit ability aspirate cell target lesion . This may improve quality specimen hence enhance diagnostic yield specimen obtain . This logical assumption , data demonstrate clearly use stylet increase yield EUS-FNA . At present time , recommend stylet re-inserted back needle prior FNA pas . The use stylet EUS-FNA cumbersome , time energy consuming increase cost EUS-FNA needle system . In circumstance , stylet may actually make EUS-FNA difficult may impossible advance remove stylet target puncture . This tend occur echoendoscope needle bent large ( 19 gauge ) needle use . In addition , data compare effectiveness EUS-FNA stylet FNA without stylet limit . Paquin et al compare adequacy , bloodiness , yield FNA sample obtain stylet FNA without stylet . In study , use stylet EUS-FNA associate reduced specimen adequacy bloody pass . 13 Thus use stylet EUS-FNA questionable need investigation . If diagnostic yield , adequacy quality specimen obtain EUS-FNA without stylet find equivalent stylet , could potentially make strong case use stylet thus make procedure easy , time- cost-efficient . The hypothesis specific aim prospective randomize controlled trial follow : First hypothesis : There difference degree cellularity , contamination , amount blood sample obtain EUS-FNA without stylet Specific Aim # 1 : To compare degree cellularity , contamination , amount blood sample obtain EUS-FNA without stylet Second hypothesis : There difference diagnostic yield malignancy specimen obtain EUS-FNA stylet compare EUS-FNA without stylet . Specific Aim # 2 : To compare diagnostic yield malignancy specimen obtain EUS-FNA without stylet . Third hypothesis : An acceptable level inter-observer agreement exist among cytopathologists assessment specimen obtain EUS-FNA stylet EUS-FNA without stylet . Specific Aim # 3 : To assess inter-observer agreement among cytopathologists evaluation specimen obtain EUS-FNA stylet specimen obtain EUS-FNA without stylet .</detailed_description>
