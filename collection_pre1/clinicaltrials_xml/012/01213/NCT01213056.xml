	<brief_summary>The literature efficacy Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) treatment chronic pain well establish . Support efficacy Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) mindfulness base treatment chronic pain building . Recently , research demonstrate efficacy Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy ( MBCT ) simultaneously address outcome variable target CBT mindfulness base treatment modality . Although efficacy MBCT depression population investigate , extant literature report MBCT chronic pain . The current application proposes investigate feasibility efficacy MBCT protocoll adapt chronic pain series pilot group headache pain patient . We select headache pain patient trial headache pain common complaint general population , frequently report cause pain medical practice , one disabling condition gender combine . To examine feasibility adapt protocol , investigator investigate number treatment related outcome recruitment , completion , drop rate . Both primary secondary outcome variable investigate determine treatment efficacy . This study provide research base examine feasibility efficacy MBCT pain . Results study lay foundation future randomize control trial compare MBCT attention control , future comparative effectiveness study MBCT CBT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) well establish efficacious treatment wide variety chronic pain condition , include headache pain . A promising trend within behavioral medicine field recent year integration mindfulness traditional treatment modality development innovative treatment base upon principle . Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) maintain patient-centered approach focus upon mindfulness meditation key mechanism teach people cope pain , take good care , improve overall quality life . MBSR successfully utilized number disorder include chronic pain 1,2,3 general medical population 4 Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy ( MBCT ) ,5 originally develop target relapse prevention major depression , essentially modification MBSR incorporate traditional cognitive-behavioral intervention extant MBSR framework . Studies MBCT support efficacy elicit cognitive change similar demonstrate CBT , still incorporate general salutary effect see MBSR,6,7,8,9,10While MBCT apply population , publish work date adapt chronic pain patient . This surprising gap literature give effectiveness CBT mindfulness independently chronic pain . Therefore , present proposal seek begin fill gap test feasibility efficacy MBCT chronic pain series pilot group . Primary Specific Aims The propose project feasibility study design test MBCT protocol chronic pain treatment provide pilot data support subsequent research proposal submit National Institutes Health . In initial trial investigator use patient primary complaint headache pain treat collaborate headache clinic . We select target population headache pain highly disable common pain related complaint treat medical practice . Furthermore , give time frame study , feasible recruit patient PI establish ongoing collaborative relationship . The propose project emphasize research area health , medicine , behavior . Aim 1 : To examine feasibility treatment , data collect regard participant flow across stage study design , include recruitment , participation , drop-out rate , percentage session attend . Furthermore , pre-treatment expectation , post-treatment satisfaction , global rating self-perceived improvement assess . Hypotheses : It expect feasibility MBCT , measure indicator , comparable similar data psychosocial treatment pain , CBT . Aim 2 : As initial test efficacy MBCT chronic pain , investigator compare immediate treatment condition delay treatment ( OT ) control pre- post-intervention measure . Time constraint current project necessitate follow-up assessment part future proposal . Hypotheses : Participants immediate treatment condition obtain significantly great pre-post treatment gain compare OT primary outcome measure pain acceptance , pain catastrophizing , pain interference ; secondary outcome measure mindfulness , pain intensity , perceive disability , selfefficacy , quality life , depression . Long-term objective : Future project include randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) compare MBCT attention control condition ( education support group ) , eventually comparative effectiveness stUdy CBT vs. MBCT . Innovative aspect propose study : This first examination MBCT chronic pain , incorporate specific component mindfulness cognitive behavioral therapy form comprehensive treatment approach .</detailed_description>
