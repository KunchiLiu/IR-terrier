	<brief_summary>Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) fluorine-18 fluoromisonidazole ( FMISO ) use several year non invasive imaging technique study tumor hypoxia . Several experimental clinical study indicate FMISO uptake tissue correlate tissue oxygen tension FMSO PET allow non-invasive differentiation hypoxic normoxic tumor . Currently , FMISO-PET represent best characterize validated noninvasive hypoxia imaging technique . Nevertheless , clinical study also show limitation FMISO PET . Accumulation FMISO hypoxic tumor relatively low , result low contrast hypoxic tumor surround normal tissue . In addition , image need start relatively late tracer injection ( 3 hour post-injection ) , significant percentage fluorine-18 label already decay count statistic PET image relatively low . Because limitation , FMISO PET still use research center , despite high clinical interest hypoxia imaging .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective study The aim study : - evaluate hypoxia image agent , HX4 , patient solitary tumor ( i.e. , locally advanced head neck cancer ) - gain information bio-distribution [ F-18 ] HX4 - compare PET image [ F-18 ] FMISO [ F-18 ] HX4 resolution , signal background ratio , tumor/blood ratio</detailed_description>
