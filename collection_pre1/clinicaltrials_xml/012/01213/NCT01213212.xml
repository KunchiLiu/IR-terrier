	<brief_summary>The study investigate whether caloric restrict dietary regime prevent onset and/or progression chronic kidney disease type 2 diabetic patient abdominal obesity , amelioration concomitant metabolic abnormality insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , hypertension inflammation , possible risk factor onset kidney disease . The main aim study therefore evaluate renoprotective effect caloric restriction ( CR ) subject risk nephropathy . Secondary aim well understand dietary implementation modulate renal disease associate metabolic abnormality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Renal Functional Abnormalities With Calorie Restriction Subjects With Abdominal Obesity Type 2 Diabetes Increased Renal Cardiovascular Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Obesity major risk factor type 2 diabetes , turn associate nephropathy one third patient . Obesity also independent risk factor chronic renal disease , regardless association diabetes . Furthermore , chronic renal disease strong risk factor cardiovascular morbidity mortality people diabetes without . However , mechanism responsible adverse nephrologic effect obesity type 2 diabetes clear , likely involve insulin resistance , low-grade systemic inflammation , hyperlipidemia , increase synthesis vasoactive fibrogenic substance , include angiotensin II , insulin , leptin transform growth factor β1 . These substance may individually interactively affect glomerular hyperfiltration , renal venous pressure , mesangial cell hypertrophy matrix production , ultimately leading renal scarring , impair glomerular filtration rate , micro- macro- albuminuria end-stage renal disease ( ESDR ) . Of interest , risk glomerular hyperfiltration hyperperfusion enhance especially subject abdominal obesity . Both condition predispose microalbuminuria , early marker renal disease increase cardiovascular risk . A grow body evidence show calorie restriction ( CR ) improve many metabolic abnormality associate obesity type 2 diabetes . In particular , recently demonstrate long-term CR result profound sustained beneficial effect major atherosclerosis risk factor , serum Total cholesterol , Low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) -C , High density lipoprotein ( HDL ) -C , triglyceride , blood pressure . CR also provide powerful protective effect obesity , insulin resistance , inflammation , reflect extremely low C reactive protein ( CRP ) level tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha , cardiovascular aging ( i.e . leave ventricular stiffness ) . We also find long-term CR reduces serum concentration proinflammatory cytokine , triiodothyronine growth factor platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , transform growth factor ( TGF ) -beta-1 , also factor actively involved progression chronic kidney disease . Taken together , preliminary evidence suggest CR might prevent renal function deterioration diabetic , obese patient . However , hypothesis test far . Objectives : - The major goal pilot , explorative study provide comprehensive evaluation effect CR pathophysiological mechanism may affect onset progression chronic kidney disease subject abdominal obesity type 2 diabetes . - Evaluate whether CR reduce glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) subject abdominal obesity type 2 diabetes , still evidence renal disease [ serum creatinine &lt; 1.2 mg/dL albuminuria &lt; 20 μg/min ( median 3 consecutive measurement overnight urine collection ) ] , assess whether CR reduces also kidney perfusion and/or filtration fraction , whether hemodynamic change correlate concomitant reduction urinary albumin excretion rate . - Investigate relationship change renal hemodynamics and/or albuminuria concomitant change abdominal circumference , body weight , body mass index , blood pressure , insulin sensitivity ( assessed euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp ) , serum lipid , adipokines level ( namely adiponectin , leptin ) , angiotensin II , marker chronic inflammation . - Assess whether CR may reduce risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) diabetic , obese patient ( insulin resistance , visceral obesity , hypertension ) . Design : After baseline evaluation clinical ( blood pressure , body weight , abdominal circumference ) routine laboratory parameter , renal hemodynamics [ glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) renal plasma flow ( RPF ) assess iohexol PAH plasma clearance , respectively , filtration fraction ( FF ) renal vascular resistance ( RVR ) calculate standard formula ] , insulin sensitivity ( estimate euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp ) , full lipid profile assessment , urinary albumin excretion rate ( mean three measurement three consecutive overnight urine collection ) , patient satisfy selection criterion randomly allocate either CR intervention ( 25 % CR ) `` ad libitum '' diet ( AL ) 6 month . The dietary guideline calorie restrict diet base measurement individual food-intake diary `` rest metabolic rate '' ( RMR ) ( measure use indirect calorimetry ) baseline . CR correspond calorie decrease 25 % calculated baseline calorie intake measure 7-days food-intake diary `` RMR x activity level '' ( activity level calculate use physical activity questionnaire ) . A food-intake diary provide specific instruction Investigator ( write form ) . Baseline evaluation repeat every three month end study ( except renal hemodynamics study euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp repeat month 6 ) .</detailed_description>
