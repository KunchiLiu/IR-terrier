	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine add increase dose CellCept lower dose tacrolimus ( Prograf Advagraf ) cyclosporine ( Neoral ) , and/or steroid reduce likelihood develop coronary heart disease next 10 year . The investigator calculate change risk develop coronary heart disease use Framingham score . The Framingham score mathematical equation include follow information : Age , Gender , Diabetes status , Smoking status , Lipids , Blood Pressure . The Framingham score estimate likely someone develop coronary heart disease next 10 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mycophenolate Mofetil Reducing Cardiovascular Risk Renal Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidney transplant recipient require take medication call immunosuppressant low immune system help protect donated kidney . The medication improve year result donate kidney generally work longer . This allow Transplant Team focus long term complication kidney transplantation cardiovascular disease . There prospective ( look forward ) research study look kidney transplant recipient cardiovascular risk factor transplant . We know immunosuppressive medication number serious side effect increase cardiovascular disease risk factor high blood pressure , high lipid ( fat blood ) , high blood sugar . Medications tacrolimus , cyclosporine prednisone work well protect donate kidney also know increase risk develop worsen cardiovascular disease . CellCept another type immunosuppressive agent . CellCept associate much risk develop cardiovascular disease . This pilot study do collect information cardiovascular risk factor kidney transplant recipient see adjust immunosuppressive medication help low overall risk develop heart disease future . This research study plan enroll 45 participant 2 different transplant centre Canada : St. Michael 's Hospital Toronto St. Paul 's Hospital Saskatoon . The study duration approximately 7 month per participant . The study look participant 30 year age old least 6 month transplant operation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Renal transplant recipient ≥ 6 month postday transplant surgery . 2 . Single organ kidney recipient ( may first repeat transplant ) . 3 . Age ≥ 30 year age Day 0 visit . 4 . Immunosuppressive regimen consist CNI ( cyclosporine [ CsA , Neoral ] tacrolimus [ TAC , Prograf Advagraf ] , corticosteroids either MMF ( CellCept ) , ECMPS ( Myfortic ) , AZA ( Imuran ) SRL ( Rapamune ) baseline visit . Patients maintain dose ( ) least 4 week prior study enrolment . 5 . If patient take MPA immunosuppressant time screen visit , MMF ( CellCept ) dose must ≤ 1500 mg/day ; ECMPS ( Myfortic ) dose must ≤ 1080 mg/day . 6 . Framingham risk factor score exceeds low comparative 10year CHD risk , base age gender . 7 . Presence least one establish CV risk factor baseline warrant modification immunosuppressive regimen include : Hypertension : Blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg systolic and/or ≥ 90 mmHg diastolic and/or require ≥ 1 antihypertensive medication . Diabetes mellitus : Established diabetes require treatment oral hypoglycemic agent insulin , know IFG IGT base 75g oral glucose tolerance testing ( 2003 Canadian Diabetes Association criterion ) . Hyperlipidemia : TC ≥ 5.2 mmol/L , LDLC ≥ 2.6 mmol/L , TG ≥ 1.7 mmol/L , TC : HDL ≥ 4 and/or require ≥ 1 antihyperlipidemia agent . 8 . Willingness ability complete protocol requirement . 9 . Written informed consent . 1 . Contraindication receive MMF ( CellCept ) increase CellCept dose . 2 . Clinically suspected acute rejection ( AR ) BPAR within 3 month prior baseline visit . 3 . Proteinuria ≥ 1 g/24 hour 4 . Treatment AZA ( Imuran ) , ECMPS ( Myfortic ) SRL ( Rapamune ) patient physician decision discontinue agent switch MMF ( CellCept ) time randomization . 5 . MDRD ( 4variable ) eGFR &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 6 . Patients currently exceed threshold plasma glucose , cholesterol blood pressure . Patients may reconsider 1 month treatment place therapeutic change anticipate . 7 . Patients require change blood pressure , blood sugar blood lipid management Screening Visit Day 0 . Patients may reconsider 1 month adjust treatment place therapeutic change anticipate . 8 . Pregnancy , lactation ( woman childbearing potential ) inability decision use reliable method contraception entire study duration . 9 . Active infection require treatment . 10 . Treatment unlicensed investigational drug , device prohibit medication see Section 4.4.1 11 . Participation interventional clinical trial previous 4 week trial . 12 . History malignancy , nonmelanoma skin cancer totally excise recur &gt; 2 year . 13 . History psychological illness condition could interfere patient 's ability understand comply study requirement . 14 . Presence significant diseases issue , opinion sponsorinvestigator , may : Put patient risk result study participation Influence study result Affect patient 's ability participate study Require change immunosuppression medication use dose change within next 6 month ( unstable renal function , gout may require treatment prednisone , etc ) Reduce life expectancy . Examples include limited history noncompliance transportation issue could affect participant 's ability successfully complete study requirement . Inability refusal provide blood sample , endstage disease organ lung , liver heart . 15 . Exclusion patient hypersensitive CellCept ( mycophenolate mofetil ) , mycophenolic acid component drug ) .</criteria>
