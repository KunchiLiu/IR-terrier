A chronic generalize immune activation recognize main driving force T cell depletion , loss anti-HIV-1 immunity disease progression chronic HIV-1 infection . However , still unknown whether reduce immune activation restore CD4 T cell count lead immune reconstitution chronic HIV infection . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) demonstrate decrease immune responses host , suppress inflammation HIV-infected non-responders . Here , investigator propose hypothesis MSC reduce immune activation subsequently lead restoration CD4 T-cell count dependent dose transfuse MSCs HIV-infected patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although HIV-1 infection characterize progressive depletion CD4+ T cell eventually lead clinically significant immunodeficiency , chronic generalize immune activation recognize main driving force T cell depletion , loss anti-HIV-1 immunity disease progression chronic HIV-1 infection . In particular , immune activation identify disease determinant independent viral load cell death HIV-1 infection . A series clinical evidence indicate activated CD8 T cell may attack body cell infected virus . Because , CD4 cell infect HIV frequently destroy CD8 cell . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) adult stem cell originate mesenchymal connective tissue bone marrow , adipose tissue , placenta , umbilical cord , cord blood , peripheral blood , liver , etc . These cell show immunomodulation , self-renewal , multi-directional differentiation potential . In particular , MSCs recently emerge promising candidate cell-based immunotherapy modulate immune response various way . A series study indicate secretion dissoluble cytokine direct contact MSCs block development function antigen-presenting cell , inhibit differentiation B cell , suppress immune response T cell natural killer cell . The immunosuppressive effect infuse MSCs successfully employ treatment acute severe graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . Thus , MSC may reduce inflammatory response promote tissue recovery human disease . The purpose study learn dose transfuse MSC reduces level activation CD8 cell people infect HIV . The decreased activation CD8 cell may lead CD4 T cell restoration HIV infection . This study also look dose MSCs tolerate safety HIV- infected patient . Participants study randomly assign one three treatment arm : Arm A : Participants receive 48 week low dose MSC treatment follow 48-week follow-up observation . Arm B : Participants receive 48 week high dose MSC treatment follow 48-week follow-up observation . Arm C : Participants receive 48 week saline placebo follow 48-week follow-up observation . Study treatment give 0 , 4 , 12 , 24 , 36 48 week since onset treatment . There additional 48 week follow-up purpose safety . After treatment start , participant ask come clinic Weeks 4 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48,60,72,84 96 . At visit participant receive enough study treatment last next visit . Each visit last 2 3 hour . At visit participant physical exam , answer question medication take feeling , blood drawn safety ass CD4/CD8 cell count viral load . Some additional blood also store immunology testing . At visit participant ask question medication medical history , pupil dilate , hear test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . Some visit require participant arrive fasting . Pregnancy test may also conduct participant able become pregnant pregnancy suspect .</detailed_description>
