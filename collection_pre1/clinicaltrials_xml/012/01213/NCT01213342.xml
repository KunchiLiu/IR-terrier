As dry eye disease associate inflammation ocular surface ( DEWS report , Ocular Surface , 2007 ) , investigator hypothesize omega-3 fatty acid supplement use study help improve dry eye sign , eye surface irritation ( stain ) tear film osmolarity , overall measure tear film stability dry eye status .

	<detailed_description>Dry Eye disorder tear film due tear deficiency excessive tear evaporation cause damage expose ocular surface associate symptom ocular discomfort . If leave untreated , severe dry eye lead desiccation corneal epithelium , increase discomfort sometimes loss vision . Abundant evidence animal model clinical evaluation confirm inflammation integral part moderate severe Dry Eye Disease ( DED ) state likely significant pathogenesis lead chronicity DED . Omega-3 essential fatty acid ( EFAs ) show anti-inflammatory effect inhibit multiple aspect inflammatory response . DED common grow problem population age , cause chronic pain visual disturbance adequately treat current approach . If leave untreated , severe dry eye lead desiccation corneal epithelium , increase discomfort sometimes loss vision.The benefit possibility alleviate eliminate symptom DED clinical data gain safety efficacy omega-3s , already market over-the-counter treatment DED without hard scientific data . The potential benefit treatment outweigh minimal risk participation . This study hop discover efficacy tolerability omega-3 EFA 's treatment dry eye ocular surface disease .</detailed_description>
