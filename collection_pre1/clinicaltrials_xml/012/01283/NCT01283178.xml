	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . CT PET scan treatment-planning system may help plan radiation therapy . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving radiation therapy together cisplatin may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose intensity-modulated image guide adaptive radiation therapy give together cisplatin treat patient locally advanced head neck squamous cell cancer</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility integrate molecular imaging ( PET FLT tracer ) current state-of-the-art image-guided adaptive radiation therapy ( IGART ) head neck cancer . II . To determine within predefined range maximum tolerate radiation dose concurrent cisplatin molecular anatomic image-based IGART head neck cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I . To compare gross tumor volume define FDG-PET , FLT-PET , CBCT , regular FBCT , , follow completion chemo-radiation therapy . II . To evaluate impact escalate dos tumor sub-volumes high FLT FDG uptake prior radiation therapy use post-treatment FDG image early surrogate sub-volume-specific local control . III . To develop database consist molecular anatomic image , include daily CBCT data set , obtain chemo-radiation therapy support research . Potential application include determination optimal adaptive re-planning frequency benefit base IGART 4D anatomic data set derive deformably register daily CBCT FBCT data set . IV . Determine patient long-term toxicity survival . V. To evaluate impact daily image-guided setup ; off-line every week adaptive re-planning ; molecular-image base target spar tissue organ responsible late early treatment sequela . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study intensity-modulated radiotherapy . Patients undergo intensity-modulated image-guided adaptive radiotherapy daily 5 day week 6 week . Patients also receive cisplatin IV day 1 22 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 4 week , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 12 month , every 6 month 2 year , annually 2 year .</detailed_description>
