	<brief_summary>The purpose study test drug RAD001 combination chemotherapy drug , Carboplatin Cetuximab . Because RAD001 use combination , clear dose best use combination . The investigator test safety RAD001 combination Carboplatin Cetuximab see effect ( good and/or bad ) cancer , find high dose RAD001 give without cause bad side effect . The dos Carboplatin Cetuximab vary drug consider part current standard care patient condition .</brief_summary>

Sexually active woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use effective method birth control course study , manner risk failure minimize . Prior study enrollment , WOCBP must advise importance avoid pregnancy trial participation potential risk factor unintentional pregnancy . In addition , men enrol study understand risk sexual partner childbearing potential practice effective method birth control . All WOCBP instruct contact Investigator immediately suspect might pregnant ( e.g. , miss late menstrual period ) time study participation .

Uncontrolled brain leptomeningeal metastasis , include patient continue require glucocorticoid brain leptomeningeal metastasis . Patients neurological symptom must undergo CT scan/MRI brain exclude brain metastasis . Patients currently receive anticancer therapy receive anticancer therapy within 4 week start study drug ( include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , antibody base therapy , etc. ) . Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 4 week . Any unresolved toxicity ( except alopecia ) great NCICommon Toxicity Criteria Adverse Effects ( CTCAE ) v3.0 grade 2 prior systemic anticancer therapy . Patients receive prior treatment mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor ( sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus ) .
