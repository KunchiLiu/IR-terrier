	<detailed_description>Schistosomiasis one major communicable disease public health socio-economic importance develop world . More 600 million people risk infection schistosomiasis , 207 million infect 120 million suffering severe morbidity due schistosomiasis . Soil transmit helminth ( hookworm , Trichuris trichura Ascaris lumbricoides ) infect 2 billion people child risk age group . Common clinical outcome soil transmit helminth ( STHs ) include anaemia , impaired physical development , cognition malnutrition area especially primary school child . Global estimate indicate 243 million case malaria worldwide ( 85 % ) report African region . It account estimate 863 000 death 2008 , 89 % occur Africa alone . The high prevalence schistosomiasis , STHs malaria striking similarity condition favour survival , reproduction transmission include poverty , lack preventive measure , health care , safe water sanitary facility , similarity temperature condition , make polyparasitism parasites `` norm exception '' tropical sub-tropical area . Separate study show endemicity schistosomiasis , STHs malaria Zimbabwe study demonstrate high prevalence schistosomiasis , STHs malaria among primary schoolchildren . Though single parasite investigate separate study , result previous study indicate geographic overlap helminth Plasmodium thus polyparasitism especially primary schoolchildren . However data scarce extend polyparasitism schistosomiasis , STHs Plasmodium malaria Zimbabwe else . Delineation area co-endemic helminthiasis malaria knowledge proportion population co-infections first step allocate limited public health resource integrate control programme . Using parasitological method study seek determine distribution polyparasitism primary schoolchildren live rural commercial farm area Zimbabwe . Prevalence anaemia among child 5 year age Zimbabwe 58 % ( range 55.4 % -63.1 % ) 38 % ( range 30.7 % -47.5 % ) woman . However prevalence anaemia primary school age child ( 5-15 year ) report . Neither report etiology anaemia age group . Data also lack contribution STHs , schistosomiasis Plasmodium falciparum report anaemia prevalence Zimbabwe although major contributor disease . There also paucity evidence impact polyparasitism helminths Plasmodium anaemia especially among susceptible primary schoolchildren develop world include Zimbabwe . These gap derail policy decision appropriate integrate control strategy base scientific evidence field study . The impact polyparasitism anaemia among primary schoolchildren live commercial farm area determine study . The grow interest global control polyparasitism combine different intervention economically consider cost effective global attention focus strategy . However number operational research question include choice different integrate control strategy , time treatment cycle , feasibility implementation impact prevalence polyparasitism , anaemia require evaluation roll large scale control program . A longitudinal study conduct investigate impact combine regular school base treatment delay treatment parasitic disease polyparasitism anaemia . Zimbabwe among WHO member state place control schistosomiasis , malaria STHs high agenda . Wide spread use Praziquantel inevitable . However whilst global use Praziquantel scaling , also grow concern use single drug treatment disease affect 200 million people especially wake low cure rate report Senegal Egypt . Consequently recommendation continue monitor Praziquantel resistance pressure wide spread use drug make . Current data lacking efficacy Praziquantel treatment schistosomiasis Zimbabwean population . Praziquantel drug efficacy determine study order advice health manager implication mass drug administration pending Zimbabwe prepare mass treatment use school base approach . The World Health Organization recommend large scale control programme precede baseline survey order monitor evaluate control strategy implementation . For control helminthiasis , conduct baseline survey grade three child ( 8-10years ) recommend since harbour high prevalence intensity infection community follow least two year monitor evaluate effectiveness control strategy implement . Thus prevalence helminth age group use index assess community prevalence . However data Knowledge attitude practice ( KAP ) grade three child relation schistosomiasis , STHs malaria lacking . The impact school health education behaviour modification school child towards prevention helminthiasis malaria Zimbabwe also scarce . A follow KAP study conduct grade three child school base health education integrate treatment .</detailed_description>
