	<brief_title>Prevention Treatment Induced Neuropathy Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuropathy one side effect occur patient receive thalidomide and/or bortezomib . Usually mild sometimes improve go away thalidomide bortezomib treatment stop . However , patient , numbness tingling remain even treatment stop . It make difficult patient feel object hand , feel ground foot .

If assign Group A , take placebo ( pill look like study drug contain active ingredient ) Day 1 . Staring Day 2 , take pill 2 time day ( every 12 hour ) , 10 week . If assign Group B take large dose minocycline 1 time mouth day start therapy study , small dose minocycline mouth every 12 hour 10 week . Minocycline take without food , need take liquid . No matter group assign , receive thalidomide and/or bortezomib accord standard schedule . Neither doctor clinic research staff know medication ( placebo minocycline ) receiving . Only pharmacist give medication know . If serious concern safety medication might receive , doctor tell medication receiving .
