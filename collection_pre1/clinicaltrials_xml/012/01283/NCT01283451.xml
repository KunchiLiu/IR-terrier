	<brief_summary>Near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) provide non-invasive mean continuously monitor tissue oxygenation , may useful diagnosis acute compartment syndrome ( ACS ) . Placement sensor pad surface skin must light penetrates intend compartment without inadvertently obtain measurement adjacent compartment . The objective study examine whether NIRS measurement compartment truly represent tissue perfusion intend compartment , indicate predictable decrease muscle oxygenation give compartment response muscle fatigue . The investigator hypothesize tissue oxygenation value stimulate compartment significantly decrease follow muscle stimulation , indicate intend muscle compartment successfully isolate . Additionally , investigator hypothesize NIRS value unstimulated muscle compartment change baseline .</brief_summary>
