	<brief_summary>In recent year , robotic device become common medical practice . Such device provide effective way communicate within clinical setting , recent study show far diverse us robot , range training future surgeon diagnose patient . In investigator study , investigator would like investigate whether effective employ robotic device administration neurostimulation treatment . It investigators hypothesis introduction robotic device yield minimal inaccuracy standard neuromodulation treatment protocol . In addition , investigator also predict high satisfaction rating participant involve condition involve robot .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients neuromodulation system implant either movement disorder chronic pain require program system approach enter study . Those consent consecutively assign either normal standard care ( i.e . program system experienced clinician ) program system inexperienced programmer ( nurse ) direct experienced programmer via remote presence robot . Both nurse patient complete questionnaire rating satisfaction program experience . They receive one questionnaire end programming session . There test point .</detailed_description>
