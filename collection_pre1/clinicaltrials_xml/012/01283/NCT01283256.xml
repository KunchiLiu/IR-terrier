	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Zonisamide Antiepileptic Drug Monotherapy Adjunctive Therapy Treatment Adult Patients With Partial , Generalized Combined Seizures .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label non-comparative , multicentric observational post marketing surveillance study compare safety efficacy zonisamide adjunctive therapy monotherapy patient partial , generalize combined seizure , initiate dose 100mg/day titrate maximum 600mg per day base seizure control tolerability 24 week treatment period . This study include total 900 patient partial , generalize combined seizure across 30 centre country . The patient enrol base inclusion exclusion criterion evaluate safety efficacy every 4 weekly interval 24 week . There total 7 study visit patient evaluate clinically reportable adverse event , safety Patients Global Assessment Tolerability Therapy ( PGATT ) 4-point scale efficacy evaluation reduction seizure frequency primary objective study . For secondary objective patient data evaluate determine responder rate ( &gt; = 50 % reduction seizure frequency baseline ) seizure freedom 24 week study period .</detailed_description>
