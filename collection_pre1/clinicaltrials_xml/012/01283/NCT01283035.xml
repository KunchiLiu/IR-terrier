	<brief_summary>Akt inhibitor MK2206 drug may stop cancer cell grow block protein call protein kinase B ( AKT ) inside cell . AKT interact protein cell part P13K/AKT pathway , pathway know play role growth cancer cell . Mutations P13K AKT , change another protein call phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) pathway lead become active normal . This study investigate effective MK-2206 treating ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer mutation P13K AKT low level PTEN .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Akt Inhibitor MK2206 Treatment Recurrent Platinum-Resistant Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess activity MK-2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK2206 ) patient recurrent grade 2 3 platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian , fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer , measure frequency patient experience objective tumor response Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion survive progression-free least 6 month initiation therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess duration progression-free overall survival follow initiation therapy MK-2206 cohort patient enrol study . II . To determine toxicity MK-2206 , assess active version National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v4.0 III . To explore association select biomarkers response MK-2206 ( assess objective tumor response , progression-free survival , overall survival ) IV . To explore development feedback loop activation target inhibition MK-2206 via analysis pre-treatment post-treatment biopsy select patient enrolled trial . OUTLINE : Akt inhibitor MK2206 take orally ( PO ) week four week ( one cycle ) . Treatment continue long subject benefiting study drug . During cycle subject physical exam , blood sample electrocardiogram ( EKG ) ( first 2 cycle ) . Every 2 cycle compute tomography ( CT ) scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) chest , stomach area , pelvis perform . Optional tumor biopsy may perform .</detailed_description>
