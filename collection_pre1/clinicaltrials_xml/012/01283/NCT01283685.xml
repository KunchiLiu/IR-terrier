	<brief_summary>Regular exercise help patient lung disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . But COPD patient hard time train breathe . To improve program train one leg time . Another way make exercise easy breathe helium . Putting two method , one-legged helium , together may improve program even . This project plan ass whether breathe helium improve one-legged exercise endurance . If , may reason combine one-legged exercise breathe helium part respiratory rehabilitation program . The aim study determine whether breathe helium-hyperoxia enables increase constant power endurance time one-legged exercise ventilatory limited subject COPD . The null hypothesis patient sufficient peripheral muscle limitation ventilatory unload use helium-hyperoxia additional benefit exercise tolerance . The investigator hypothesize patient COPD ventilatory limit relative peripheral muscle helium-hyperoxia improve exercise endurance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breathing Helium-Hyperoxia During Exercise Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize cross-over comparison trial determine effect helium-hyperoxia performance muscle specific one-legged cycling . Each participant complete two constant power exercise test cycle right leg . The test separate least 24 h. The condition two test except , randomized order , participant breathe helium-hyperoxia ( 40 % O2 , 60 % He ) mask , room air unencumbered mask supplemental oxygen ( 4 L/min ) provide nasal cannula . Participants perform three exercise test . First complete one incremental power exercise test use leg ( exercise capacity ) standardize manner . Then complete two constant power ( exercise endurance ) cycle ergometer test limit tolerance ( symptom base ) ; intent set exercise level comparable ideal training session patient would experience respiratory rehabilitation program . The exercise regimen use two session except participant breathe helium-hyperoxia ( 40 % O2 , 60 % He ) one session room air , supplemental oxygen ( 4 L/min ) provide nasal cannula , . During exercise session , heart rate , SaO2 , Borg scale rating dyspnoea leg fatigue monitor . For exercise test , participant adhere usual medical regimen , eat 2 h test drink caffeinated beverage 2 h test . All test separate least 24 h .</detailed_description>
