	<brief_summary>Non-invasive , energy-based , aesthetic treatment become increasingly popular among female male patient age . Different technology presently available rejuvenate skin , include therapeutic ultrasound , laser intense pulse light ( IPL ) , however radiofrequency emerge effective versatile modality broad range body facial treatment , include non-invasive wrinkle treatment . The apollo™ system RF system , base TriPollar™ technology . The technology base three electrode design deliver RF current focus skin , thus generate heat dermal layer . Selective focus electro-heating skin intend stimulate collagen remodel dermal layer result non invasive wrinkle treatment . The apollo™ system intend use dermatologic general surgical procedure non invasive treatment facial wrinkle rhytides . This study design order evaluate safety efficacy Apollo™ System facial wrinkle rhytides treatment .</brief_summary>
