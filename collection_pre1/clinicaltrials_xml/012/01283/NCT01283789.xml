	<brief_title>Lapatinib RAD-001 HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty twenty five percent Human Breast Cancers HER2 positive . HER2 positivity confers poor prognosis absence HER2 target therapy ( trastuzumab lapatinib ) . With targeted agent often combine chemotherapy , treatment HER2 positive breast cancer improve greatly , metastatic adjuvant setting . However patient metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer eventually develop resistance agent succumb disease . Therefore , need test new agent new combination increase efficacy HER2 target therapy and/or prevent resistance HER2 target therapy . A unique feature HER2 positive breast cancer rather high incidence brain metastasis population . Brain metastases develop one third one half patient advance HER2+ breast cancer CNS frequent site trastuzumab failure . Effective therapy patient central nervous system ( CNS ) progression cranial radiation extremely limit represent major clinical challenge . Compared trastuzumab , CNS activity , lapatinib , epidermal growth factor receptor/HER2 inhibitor , modest CNS activity . In study 200 patient Lin et al , 21 % patient experience 20 % volumetric reduction CNS lesion lapatinib . An association observe volumetric reduction improvement progression-free survival neurologic sign symptom . Of 50 evaluable patient enter lapatinib plus capecitabine extension , 20 % experienced CNS objective response 40 % experience 20 % volumetric reduction CNS lesion . Mammalian target Rapamycin ( mTOR ) serine/threonine kinase regulate key function associate cell growth , survival angiogenesis . mTOR activate HER signaling , PI3K oncogenic mutation loss PTEN function . In vitro data suggest activation mTOR PTEN loss PI3K mutation induces trastuzumab resistance . Preclinical study show mTOR inhibition enhances efficacy trastuzumab revers trastuzumab resistance cause PTEN loss . This preclinical finding confirm 2 recent Phase 1 study addition mTOR inhibitor ( RAD-001 ) trastuzumab chemotherapy reverse resistance Trastuzumab patient heavily pretreated metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer . Thus , mTOR inhibition would attractive modality add HER2 target therapy improve outcome woman HER2 positive breast cancer . Everolimus ( RAD001 ) , rapamycin analogue , orally administer inhibitor mTOR . Everolimus show promising activity solid tumor . PK data mouse model indicate penetration rapamycin Everolimus CNS substantial . Everolimus brain level approximately one-third systemic level 48 hour dose . A small molecule inhibitor HER2 , lapatinib clinically active woman advance HER2-positive breast cancer progress trastuzumab treatment . However , effectiveness class agent limit either primary resistance acquire resistance . Using unbiased genetic approach , Eichhorn et al perform genome wide loss-of-function short hairpin RNA screen identify novel modulators resistance lapatinib . Tumor suppressor PTEN identify modulator lapatinib sensitivity vitro vivo . In addition , show two dominant activate mutation PI3K pathway prevalent breast cancer , also confer resistance lapatinib . They also show PI3K-induced lapatinib resistance could abrogate use NVP-BEZ235 , dual inhibitor PI3K/mTOR . This suggest deregulation PI3K pathway lead lapatinib resistance , effectively reverse inhibition PI3K/mTOR pathway . In summary , combination Everolimus lapatinib need study woman metastatic breast cancer progress least one prior anti-HER2 therapy . If RAD-001 able overcome resistance anti-HER2 therapy , desirable response rate prolongation TTP expect . Moreover , lapatinib Everolimus appear able cross blood brain barrier , combination may prove effective controling CNS metastases population . The investigator hypothesize combine mTOR inhibitor Everolimus lapatinib effective strategy patient progress prior anti-HER2 therapy , systemically within CNS .</detailed_description>
