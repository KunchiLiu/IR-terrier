	<brief_title>Vaginal Rectal Clostridial Carriage Among Women Reproductive Age United States</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since 2000 , clostridial pelvic infection claim life least 17 young , previously healthy woman . The majority infection detect molecular method among woman test positive Clostridium sordellii ; 5 case , death due Clostridium perfringens ; 3 case , woman positive . These death occur among non-pregnant recently pregnant woman . Clostridium isolate vagina 4-18 % normal , health non-pregnant woman , Clostridium perfringens common isolate . Most study differentiate small percentage clostridia present vaginal microenvironment . The vaginal carriage rate Clostridium sordellii remain unknown , probably low , less 1 % . The correlate clostridial carriage unknown , data etiology lethality clostridial infection among woman reproductive age insufficient guide possible course safe effective prevention . In woman infected strain Clostridium perfringens Clostridium sordellii produce lethal toxin , clear whether effective treatment .</detailed_description>
