	<brief_summary>This study randomize , double-blind , sham-controlled , two-arm study conduct subject receive chemoradiation therapy treatment head neck cancer ass efficacy MuGard . The study evaluate ability MuGard reduce symptom oral mucositis . The study include treatment period approximately 7 week depend subject 's prescribe radiation plan . MuGard liquid classify medical device . It hydrate polymer system ( oral hydrogel ) intend management oral mucositis/stomatitis . When gently distribute within mouth , mucoadhesive formulation result formation protective coat oral mucosa . Subjects undergo chemotherapy radiation treatment head neck cancer high risk develop oral mucositis adverse side-effect cancer treatment . MuGard previously show reduce incidence severity mucositis head neck cancer patient undergo radiation therapy compare data historical control group .
