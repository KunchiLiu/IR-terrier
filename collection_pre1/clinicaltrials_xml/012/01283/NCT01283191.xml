	<brief_summary>While physical activity associate decreased craving increase abstinence rate smoker , publish study examine effect exercise recovery drug cocaine . One factor impede research low level patient compliance exercise protocol . One robust strategy promote maintain behavior change contingency management Behavioral Incentives ( BI ) . BI deliver incentive ( prize , voucher ) contingent upon target behavior cocaine abstinence ( Higgins et al. , 1994 ) ; treatment attendance ( Svikis et al. , 1997 ) pro-social behavior ( Kirby et al. , 1998 ) . While literature replete study demonstrate benefit BI compare control condition ( Stitzer &amp; Petry , 2006 ) , translation BI method research clinical practice meet resistance . Contributing factor include philosophical difference ( e.g. , counselor feel extrinsic reinforcement undermines recovery ) practical barrier ( e.g. , monetary cost incentive may prohibitive ) . The latter concern address Petry ( 2005 ) develop `` fish bowl '' method , use escalate variable ratio procedure reduce per patient cost BI similar effect size . As Stage 1 behavioral therapy development grant ( Rounsaville et al. , 2001 ) , primary aim research pilot test BI intervention design promote regular physical activity sample woman receive inpatient treatment SUDs . The target behavior , physical activity , objectively define 30 minute observe treadmill walk intensity 3 days/week Level 1 , 30 minute higher intensity physical activity meet ACSM criterion moderate exercise Level 2 . Specifically , pilot randomize clinical trial compare rate physical activity 6 week study period sample N=50 woman Cocaine Dependence . All participant complete baseline assessment , attend 45-min Health Fitness ( HF ) education group , follow random assignment either experimental ( BI ) control ( C ) group , equal daily access on-site treadmill . Those randomized BI , however , also eligible 3 days/week , receive incentive complete 30 minute treadmill walk . Incentives dispense use Petry Fish Bowl method . Women assign BI group receive behavioral incentive ( form gift card prize ) complete schedule exercise session ( Level 1 ) , opportunity earn `` bonus '' draw meeting moderate intensity exercise criterion , specify ACSM ( 2007 , revise ) guideline ( Level 2 ) . In Level 1 , number token participant draw gym bag ( present study equivalent `` fishbowl '' ) visit link exercise session attendance , consistent attendance result great number draw . In Level 2 , number token participant draw gym bag link intensity participant 's exercise . Specifically , begin Week 2 study , participant re-evaluated exercise capability . Those pass safety screen encourage exercise high intensity , re-evaluated obtain safety clearance . Once clear , participant meet criteria moderate exercise schedule session , allot `` bonus '' draw ( Level 2 ) meeting Level 2 criterion , addition escalate number draw would receive scheduled exercise session completion ( Level 1 ) . Scheduled treadmill walk monitor record BI C group woman . Follow-ups occur study midpoint completion ( 3 6 week post-randomization , respectively ) , 4 week post-discharge . Assessments focus drug craving , mood , stress , motivation/self-efficacy , physical health well . The investigator hypothesize woman BI group complete treadmill session spend time treadmill walk C group . As Stage 1b therapy development RCT , study data use effect size estimation preparation Stage 2 RCT . This dissertation proposal provide benchmark data utility BI promote physical activity . Further , promote exercise compliance , allow scientist well evaluate potential benefit physical activity treatment outcome woman SUDs .</brief_summary>
