	<brief_summary>The goal study determine whether provide early treatment glucocorticoid drug , call methylprednisolone , improve survival critically ill patient severe community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) . Pneumonia develop bacteria agent invade lung . The body 's immune system create response produce inflammation kill bacteria . A moderate amount inflammation beneficial . But , patient sick enough admit ICU , inflammation frequently control . When body regulate inflammation vital organ ( brain , heart , lung , kidney , liver ) may damage , contribute death residual organ damage survive . Glucocorticoids help reduce inflammation . Recent study show body unable produce sufficient amount glucocorticoid , inflammation get control . Under circumstance , glucocorticoid give small dos may help aid body 's ability reduce inflammation improve recovery . In small preliminary trial , glucocorticoid treatment , addition standard antibiotic treatment , speed recovery pneumonia . It also decrease length hospital stay , increase survival . This Cooperative Studies Program study first large-scale , prospective , randomized clinical trial evaluate whether treatment improve recovery . In study , site , patient severe CAP assign one two treatment group . One group receive methylprednisolone receive placebo ( inert substance look like drug ) . The investigator choose total duration treatment 20 day ( 7 day full dose follow slow reduction 13 day ) prevent relapse inflammation allow body recover ability produce glucocorticoid . All patient also receive standardized management CAP accordance current practice guideline . The study take consideration assign treatment participate site , whether patient require mechanical ventilation time assignment . Patients follow clinically 180 day . The primary outcome cause 60-day mortality . Secondary outcome ( 1 ) in-hospital morbidity-mortality , include ventilator-free day , multiorgan dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) -free day , duration ICU hospital stay , hospital discharge ; ( 2 ) posthospital discharge morbidity-mortality , include cardiovascular complication , functional general health status first 180 day , rehospitalization , mortality 1 year . Serial blood sample also collect stored future translational research relate longitudinal inflammation marker clinical outcome . This study advance knowledge relationship inflammation long-term outcome severe CAP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>VA Cooperative Study # 574 design prospectively evaluate efficacy prolong glucocorticoid ( methylprednisolone ) treatment short- ( hospital ) long-term ( hospital discharge ) , morbidity mortality Veteran patient admit ICU ( include intermediate care unit ) severe community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) . CAP sixth common cause death ( acute mortality ) United States lead cause community-acquired infection require intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission . Despite significant advancement medical care , little change crude mortality respiratory tract infection 5 decade ( 1950-2000 ) . In United States alone , 1.3 million people admit hospital 2002 severe CAP ( 262 per 10,000 population ) estimate inpatient cost approximately $ 4.4 billion . In addition , severe CAP patient survive hospitalization experience significant increase long-term morbidity ( cardiovascular complication , impair functional status , recurrent hospitalization ) sizable mortality 1 year ( 25 % ) independent patient 's chronic health condition . Dysregulated systemic inflammation , characterize persistent elevation circulate inflammatory cytokine level time , central pathogenetic process contribute short- long-term morbidity mortality patient severe CAP . Even patient survive ICU hospital admission , elevation inflammatory cytokine last great 3 week , interleukin ( IL ) -6 level hospital discharge predict subsequent mortality . Endogenous exogenous glucocorticoid important physiologic inhibitor inflammation . In meta-analysis four , small , publish study include total 198 patient severe CAP , prolong glucocorticoid treatment associate significant reduction short-term mortality ( RR = 0.40 , 95 % CI 0.18-0.89 ; p = 0.03 ; I2 12 % ) . This Cooperative Studies Program study first large-scale , prospective , randomized clinical trial evaluate efficacy prolong methylprednisolone treatment severe CAP . In study , site , patient severe CAP randomize 1:1 ratio receive methylprednisolone placebo double-blind fashion . The investigator choose total duration treatment 20 day ( 7 day full dose follow slow reduction 13 day ) forestall relapse systemic inflammation allow recovery suppress hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis . All patient also receive standardized management CAP accordance current practice guideline . Randomization stratify separately within participate site whether patient require mechanical ventilation time randomization . Patients follow clinically 180 day . The primary outcome cause 60-day mortality . Secondary outcome ( 1 ) in-hospital morbidity-mortality , include ventilator-free day , multiorgan dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) -free day , duration ICU hospital stay , hospital discharge ; ( 2 ) posthospital discharge morbidity-mortality , include cardiovascular complication , functional general health status first 180 day , rehospitalization , mortality 1 year . Serial blood sample also collect stored future translational research relate longitudinal inflammation marker clinical outcome . Based published study VA Decision Support System , investigator estimate cause 60-day mortality severe CAP patient admit ICU 28 % . The investigator hypothesize prolonged methylprednisolone treatment reduce 60-day mortality 28 % 21 % ( 25 % relative reduction ) . A total 1406 patient ( 703 per group ) require give 85 % power detect hypothesize improvement , use two-sided 5 % significance level test . Adjusting 1 % attrition , target sample size 1420 . Assuming 5 year accrual intake rate 8 patient per year per VAMC , investigator need 36 participate VAMCs . Treatment severe CAP particular importance VA health care system large patient population single episode severe CAP associate significant short- long-term morbidity mortality . In fiscal year 2006 , 17,890 patient admit VA hospital system diagnosis CAP . Of , 3727 ( 21 % ) require ICU admission hospital stay . For ICU-admitted patient , mortality rate hospital 60 , 90 , 180 , 365 day 26 % , 34 % , 37 % , 44 % , 51 % , respectively . They average hospital stay 17.7 day hospital cost $ 49,936 , 48 % readmitted within 12 month hospital discharge . This study investigate effect off-patent , inexpensive treatment , base strong experimental translational evidence encouraging finding preliminary trial , potential significantly decrease mortality morbidity . Equally important , study advance knowledge relationship inflammation long-term outcome severe CAP . Given methylprednisolone off-patent , little incentive pharmaceutical industry fund study . The VA system Cooperative Studies Program uniquely suit conduct study .</detailed_description>
