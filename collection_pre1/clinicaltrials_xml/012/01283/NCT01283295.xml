	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop well-characterized library blood , biopsy tissue , urine sample transplant patient . Subjects without transplant also enrol comparison . Samples use study characteristic patient undergo transplantation influence response transplant therapy reaction drug use transplantation . This knowledge important help physician design new drug tailor transplant therapy individual thereby reduce side effect . In study , people ask donate blood , biopsy tissue urine . Donation sample influence patient ' treatment . These sample test use variety biological test well understand immunosuppressive drug change various component immune system . The test research ; change individual 's treatment base result test perform study . If extra sample , sample store use test later date . The ultimate goal find right combination medication individual patient keep new organ work well . This study first step direction perfect test use characterize patient 's immune system</brief_summary>
