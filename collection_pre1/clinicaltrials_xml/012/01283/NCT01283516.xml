	<criteria>ECOG Performance Status ≤ 2 life expectancy ≥ 12 week . Diagnosed locally advanced metastatic malignancy progress despite standard therapy , effective standard therapy exist . Only patient tumor characterize genetic abnormality ALK enrol . For NSCLC , ALK translocation must detect FISH ≥ 15 % tumor cell . In patient disease NSCLC , ALK translocation require overexpression ALK protein may consider indicative genetic abnormality ALK . Patients measurable nonmeasurable disease determine modified RECIST version 1.0 doseescalation phase , patient least one measurable lesion determine RECIST 1.0 expansion phase . Patients symptomatic central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases neurologically unstable require increase dos steroid control CNS disease exclude . Patients prior current history second malignancy , impaired GI function , history pancreatitis increase amylase lipase , know diagnosis HIV , clinically significant cardiac disease exclude . Patients treat chemotherapy biologic therapy investigational agent &lt; 2 week prior start study drug compound halflife ≤ 3 day , &lt; 4 week prior start study drug compound prolonged halflife exclude . Further , patient treat medication know strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A4/5 could discontinue least week prior start treatment LDK378 duration study also exclude . Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply</criteria>
