	<brief_summary>The investigator would like investigate whether clopidogrel help low level harmful marker patient coronary artery disease , time help increase cell useful repair damage blood vessel . The investigator give half patient clopidogrel half sugar pill , placebo , check level marker helpful cell group . At time investigator check well patient 's blood vessel work use ultrasound image forearm see blood vessel relax tonometry see stiff patient 's blood vessel . After 6 week drug therapy , patient switch drug test perform additional 6 week therapy . The drug take patient know patient researcher . The patient continue prescribed medical therapy duration 12 week study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation Athero-Protective Effects Clopidogrel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blockages blood vessel heart cause atherosclerosis . Atherosclerosis main cause chest pain heart attack . Gradual narrowing vessel heart cause blockage cause chronic symptom , chest pain . Those finding often cardiac catheterization detect blockage . Additionally patient may angioplasty stent place help relieve symptom . With angioplasty/stent procedure , patient place drug clopidogrel help prevent clot form narrow blood vessel . Clopidogrel blood thinner prevents clot form similar aspirin , powerful effective . Markers , substance , identify cause worsen blockage blood vessel heart . Many substance show decrease use clopidogrel . This occur separately clopidogrel 's ability prevent clot . Endothelial progenitor cell , EPCs , come mostly bone marrow helpful repair damage line blood vessel heart . The EPCs help balance damage incur blood vessel harmful marker . Several drug commonly use heart disease recently show improve EPCs function . With mind , important understand clopidogrel 's function . A decrease marker cause worsen blockage , increase number cell help repair damaged blood vessel heart important avoid future chest pain heart attack . This may clopidogrel currently protect patient develop new blockage . The investigator would like investigate whether clopidogrel help low level harmful marker patient coronary artery disease , time help increase cell useful repair damage blood vessel . The investigator give half patient clopidogrel half sugar pill , placebo , check level marker helpful cell group . At time investigator check well patient 's blood vessel work use ultrasound image forearm see blood vessel relax tonometry see stiff patient 's blood vessel . After 6 week drug therapy , patient switch drug test perform additional 6 week therapy . The drug take patient know patient researcher . The patient continue prescribed medical therapy duration 12 week study .</detailed_description>
