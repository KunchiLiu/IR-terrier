	<brief_summary>Co-selective inhibition VEGFRs FGFR potential benefit block two relevant player tumor angiogenesis simultaneously target proliferation FGF-driven tumor . Lucitanib novel dual-targeted small molecule inhibitor VEGFR1 , 2 , 3 FGFR1 show strong anti-angiogenic anti-tumor activity preclinical model well-tolerated oral dos , favorable pharmacokinetic profile . These property make attractive candidate development human . This open-label , uncontrolled , non-randomized , PhaseI/IIa study primary objective determine Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) Lucitanib administer orally , daily , continuous schedule initial 28-day cycle . Secondary objective determine safety profile , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics antitumour activity Lucitanib , give single agent adult patient advance solid tumour . The study consist two phase , dose escalation phase follow dose-expansion phase identify Recommended Dose ( RD ) . Eligible patient histologically cytologically confirm locally advanced metastatic solid tumour , relapse refractory standard therapy . For dose expansion , patient tumours bear FGFR1 11q 12-14 amplification , assess FISH CGH array , `` sensitive '' antiangiogenic treatment . These latter define patient relapse experienced stable disease ( last least six month ) partial response prior treatment approve antiangiogenic regimen patient tumour type know potentially responsive antiangiogenic agent without pretreatment antiangiogenic agent approve and/or available specific condition ( e.g thyroid cancer , thymic carcinoma ) . Serial safety assessment , include evaluation symptom , physical examination blood urine laboratory analysis perform throughout study . Cardiac function blood pressure monitor consultation cardiologist . PK parameter determine plasma sample collect first 4-week cycle analyze use validate LC-MS/MS method . Correlative study include : ( ) quantitative assessment effect E-3810 tumor vasculature DCE-MRI DCE-US imaging ; ( ii ) assay angiogenesis biomarkers i.e . soluble VEGFR2 , VEGFR1 , VEGF , bFGF , Collagen IV , FGF23 PIGF ( ELISA ) circulate endothelial progenitor cell ( CEC CEP ) . Tumor response base image accord RECIST ; circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) measure immunomagnetic CellSearch method . In patient tumours bear FGFR1 amplification efficacy Lucitanib formally test accord phase IIa design ( one-stage Flaming design , H0=0.05 , H1=0,30 , power 0,80 .</brief_summary>
