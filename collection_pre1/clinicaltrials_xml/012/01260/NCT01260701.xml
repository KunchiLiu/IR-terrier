	<brief_title>Akt Inhibitor MK2206 Treating Patients With Advanced Gastric Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate overall survival ( OS ) patient advance gastric gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) adenocarcinoma treat MK-2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK2206 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression free survival ( PFS ) patient population . II . To estimate response rate ( confirm unconfirmed complete response [ CR ] partial response [ PR ] Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] 1.1 ) patient population . III . To assess frequency severity toxicity associate regimen . OUTLINE ( CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 05/01/13 ) : Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) every day day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
