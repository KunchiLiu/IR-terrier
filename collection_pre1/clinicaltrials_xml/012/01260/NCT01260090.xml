	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury high morbidity mortality civilian military population . Blast mechanisms traumatic brain injury damage brain causing neuron disconnect atrophy . Such traumatic axonal injury lead persistently vegetative minimally conscious state , extremely limited treatment option exist , include physical , occupational , speech cognitive therapy . More 50,000 patient receive vagus nerve stimulation epilepsy depression . In addition decrease seizure frequency severity , patient report enhance mood , reduce daytime sleepiness independent seizure control , increase slow wave sleep , improve cognition , memory , quality life . The purpose study demonstrate objective improvement clinical outcome placement vagus nerve stimulator patient recover severe traumatic brain injury . Our hypothesis stimulation vagus nerve result increase cerebral blood flow metabolism forebrain , thalamus reticular formation , promote arousal improve consciousness , thereby improve outcome traumatic brain injury result minimally conscious persistent vegetative state . If study demonstrate vagus nerve stimulation safely positively impact outcome , large randomize prospective crossover trial propose . The investigator achieve objective evaluate whether vagus nerve stimulation impact clinical recovery minimally conscious persistent vegetative state cause traumatic brain injury assess FIM™ instrument Functional Assessment Measure ( FIM+FAM ) well JFK Coma Recovery Scale Score . The investigator also evaluate whether vagus nerve stimulation alters rest activational functional MRI . Twelve patient enrol initial crossover pilot study . These patient sustain severe traumatic brain injury ( Disability Rating Scale score 22 29 ) twelve month start study , concurrent active severe medical problem . Baseline EEG magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) perform prior left vagus nerve stimulation implantation . Patients randomize alternate three month period device . Outcomes assess three month interval FIM™ instrument Functional Assessment Measure ( FIM+FAM ) JFK Coma Recovery Scale neuropsychologist blind status device . Outcomes also assess use quantitative eye movement track functional magnetic resonance imaging . Patients cross every 3 month follow least 18 month .</brief_summary>
