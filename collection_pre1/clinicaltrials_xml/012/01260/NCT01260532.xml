	<brief_summary>Autoimmune thyroid disease common organ-specific autoimmune disease . AITD include Graves ' disease Hashimoto 's thyroiditis . Although pathogenesis AITD remain unclear , generally think mechanism disease complex disease susceptibility gene environmental trigger act concert initiate autoimmune response thyroid . The initial step thyroid autoimmunity activation T cell . The activation T cell require two signal : firstly , thyroid follicular cell antigen present cell bind T cell receptor antigenic HLA complex . Secondly , activation T cell also require interaction costimulatory molecule thyroid follicular cell immune cell , include CTLA-4 , CD 40 , CD28 , ICOS . PPAR- kind intranuclear transcription factor , associate adipogenesis inflammation . Some report show PPAR- polymorphism may protective effect Graves ' ophthalmopathy . The goal study investigate relationship among SNP mRNA costimulatory molecule PPAR- , serum cytokine include TNF- sIL-2R , clinical characteristic AITD patient . From study , hope clarify role costimulatory molecules PPAR- polymorphism AITD .</brief_summary>
