	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether [ 18F ] -ML-10 use conjunction PET image effective image tool early detection response oncological tumor lung , head neck chemoradiation therapy . The study evaluate potential [ 18F ] -ML-10 use conjunction PET image distinguish early course chemoradiation therapy tumor respond therapy , tumor respond therapy . Currently , distinction available physician several week month completion therapy , use anatomical imaging ( example Computed Tomography [ CT ] Magnetic Resonance Imaging [ MRI ] ) .</brief_summary>
