	<brief_summary>This phase II study ass whether treatment chemotherapy drug FOLFOX ( 5-Fluorouracil ( 5FU ) , Oxaliplatin ( Eloxatin ) Leucovorin ( Folinic Acid ) ) FOLFIRI ( 5-Fluorouracil ( 5FU ) , Irinotecan ( Camptosar ) Leucovorin ( Folinic Acid ) ) panitumumab surgery improve outcome patient liver metastasis ( cancer spread part body liver ) resectable ( surgically remove ) , colorectal cancer non mutant ( wild-type ) K-ras gene . FOLFOX/FOLFIRI intravenous ( give vein ) chemotherapy combination approve colorectal cancer panitumumab also intravenous drug approve treatment refractory ( respond treatment ) metastatic colorectal cancer whose cancer K-ras gene . These drug approve treatment colorectal cancer liver metastasis ( CRCLM ) surgery . Patients receive FOLFOX/FOLFIRI panitumumab four 2-week cycle surgery . Surgery do sooner 4 week later 8 week , completion fourth cycle chemotherapy . If liver metastasis chemotherapy surgery decrease stop grow , chemotherapy give surgery . Treatments start sooner 4 week , later 12 week , surgery . Patients receive maximum 8 cycle treatment combination drug receive panitumumab alone maximum 12 cycle . On treatment visit , patient also test procedure do . As part study , patient provide archival tumor tissue sample tissue remove surgery K-ras testing . Patients also give option allow collect tissue research ( biomarker ) study bank future study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Perioperative Chemotherapy Plus Panitumumab Patients With Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emerging data suggests KRAS mutation strong predictor resistance EGFR antagonist therapy . In KRAS wild-type cohort , addition EGFR antagonists chemotherapy show improve RR PFS . Improved response rate neoadjuvant chemotherapy would expect improve surgical outcome patient CRCLM . We therefore wish test hypothesis combination FOLFOX/FOLFIRI panitumumab , give perioperatively patient wild-type KRAS CRCLM improve outcome , compare historical control , optimally resectable patient . As patient population remain high risk recurrence post-chemotherapy , also wish explore tolerability efficacy continue panitumumab monotherapy additional 6 month . As opposed clinical trial advance colorectal cancer majority treat palliative intent , patient trial treat aggressively curative intent outset . There also additional benefit assessment tumor tissue treatment biologic agent .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm colorectal cancer available tissue test KRAS mutation . Biopsy require archived tissue available . KRAS mutation status must confirm prior registration . Only patient KRAS wildtype cancer eligible . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . Patients must resectable hepatic colorectal metastasis . Patients may synchronous unresected primary disease upon registration . Primary must resectable , either laparotomy separate laparotomy liver resection . Age &gt; 18 year . Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ( ECOG PS ) 0 1 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL hemoglobin &gt; 90 g/L total bilirubin &lt; 2 x upper limit normal ( &lt; 1.5 x ULN FOLFIRI ) , AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 5 x upper limit normal ( &lt; 3 x ULN FOLFIRI ) ; creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Appropriate imaging investigation , include CT MRI chest/abdomen/pelvis . Other scan clinically indicate may perform . All imaging study must perform within 28 day study entry . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study period six month cessation study therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Exclusion Criteria Patients must previous systemic treatment adjuvant metastatic setting within 6 month registration . Patients may prior treatment EGFR antagonist . Patients may history malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer cervix , solid malignancy curatively treat evidence disease â‰¥ 5 year . Patients may extrahepatic metastatic disease . Patients prior surgical resection hepatic metastasis extrahepatic disease ( eg . pulmonary metastasis ) also exclude study . Patients may preexist chronic hepatic disease ( eg . cirrhosis , chronic active hepatitis B C ) History allergic reaction , intolerance , attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition 5fluorouracil , oxaliplatin , panitumumab . Patients consider irinotecan must history Gilbert 's syndrome . Patients may uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction agent use study . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Patients active cardiovascular disease , i.e. , unstable angina , New York Heart Association grade II great congestive heart failure , serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication , grade II great peripheral vascular disease . In addition , patient arterial venous thrombosis , myocardial infarction , cerebral vascular accident ( stroke / transient ischemic attach ( TIA ) ) within 6 month prior study entry exclude . Patients history interstitial pneumonitis pulmonary fibrosis exclude . Organ allograft require immunosuppressive therapy .</criteria>
