	<brief_summary>Dr. Sherie Novotny Department Psychiatry UMDNJ-RWJMS collaborator start treatment trial determine whether Docosa Hexanoic Acid ( DHA ) , major omega-3 fatty acid find brain component fish oil , effect symptoms autism . We propose carry trial test effect DHA compare placebo ( pill drug ) several aspect autism child adolescent , 12-week clinical study child adolescent age group 5-17 diagnosis Autism Spectrum Disorder . Additionally trial study gene relate therapeutic agent , DHA , biomarkers relate DHA urine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Growing evidence support oxidative stress may contribute autism . Docosa Hexanoic Acid ( DHA ) normal substance present large amount brain use body produce natural antioxidant . Our hope supplement DHA individual autism may improve aspect function . Specifically aim : Aim 1 . To assess effect DHA vs. placebo treatment global severity child adolescent autistic disorder , via 12-week double blind placebo-controlled parallel study . Global severity assess Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic ( ADOS-G ) additionally young child Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale . Aim 2 . To assess effect DHA vs. placebo treatment behavioral symptom functional ability child autism . Assessment Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) -Community Version11 . Aim 3 . To develop improve protocol study design base upon study future large scale study DHA autistic population . Aim 4 . Monitor effect therapy isoprostane biomarker . Aim 5 : Develop additional biomarkers correlate autism therapy . We extend analysis neuroprostanes resolvins . We measure : ( ) Urinary excretion isoprostane metabolite , 2,3 Dinor-5,6 dihydro-PGF2t iPF4Î±-VI . ( ii ) DHA derive resolvins D2 , D4 , D5 D6 neuroprotectin . Aim 6 : Confirm preliminary result correlate increased isoprostane excretion GSTM1*0 copy number individual autism . Aim 7 : In way , correlate GSTM1*0 copy number response therapy assess diminution isoprostane excretion therapy . Aim 8 : Study additional biomarkers develop Hypothesis # 2 correlation GSTM1*0 copy number response therapy identify additional gene-biomarker correlation . Aim 9 : Study additional polymorphism gene relate DHA metabolism , association autism , gene-biomarker correlation , correlation response therapy .</detailed_description>

Subjects pregnant nursing mother . Sexually active female childbearing potential use adequate birth control measure ( detail inclusion criterion ) . Subjects overall adaptive behavior score age two year Vineland Adaptive Behavior Rating Scale . Subjects active unstable epilepsy . Subjects follow past present mental disorder : schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , major depressive disorder , bipolar I II disorder substance abuse disorder . Subjects serious suicidal risk . Subjects clinically significant unstable medical illness would contraindicate participation study , include hematopoietic cardiovascular disease , pancreatitis , liver toxicity , polycystic ovary syndrome Subjects report history encephalitis , phenylketonuria , tuberous sclerosis , fragile X syndrome , anoxia birth , pica , neurofibromatosis , hypomelanosis Ito , hypothyroidism , Duchenne muscular dystrophy , maternal rubella . Patients history follow : gastrointestinal , liver , kidney , know condition presently interfere presently absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion drug , cerebrovascular disease brain trauma , clinically significant unstable endocrine disorder , hypo hyperthyroidism , recent history presence form malignancy Treatment within previous 30 day drug know welldefined potential toxicity major organ Subjects clinically significant abnormality laboratory test physical exam Subjects likely require ECT . Subjects unable tolerate taper psychoactive medication necessary . Subjects history hypersensitivity severe side effect associate use divalproex sodium , ineffective prior therapeutic trial omega three fatty acid . Subjects receive follow intervention within prescribed period start treatmentinvestigational drug within previous 30 day . Subjects begin new alternative nonmedication treatment , diet , vitamin , psychosocial therapy , within previous three month . Subjects organic systemic disease patient require therapeutic intervention , otherwise specify , would confound evaluation safety study medication . Subjects reside remote geographical area regular access transportation clinical facility . If patient well enough ( define CGIAD Severity score 3 '' mildly ill '' better )</criteria>
