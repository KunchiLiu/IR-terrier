	<brief_summary>Background : - Two area surface brain , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) motor cortex ( MC ) , play key role learning . Researchers interested determine effect transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) DLPFC MC participant ' performance learning task . By study effect TMS reaction time , learn , memory , researcher hope good understand treat condition Parkinson 's disease traumatic brain injury affect part brain . Objectives : - To study effect transcranial magnetic stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex motor cortex . - To learn area brain use perform certain learn memory task . Eligibility : - Healthy , right-handed individual 18 70 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical neurological examination medical psychiatric history . - Participants ask take part one five different part study . Most participant four 2-hour visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center . Some participant ( involve Part 5 ) one 2-hour visit . - Parts 1 2 ( four visit ) : Participants TMS , learn task may provide small monetary reward . On first visit , TMS , participant take intelligence test base reading aloud word give card . Participants routine magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain within past year also scan . - Parts 3 4 ( four visit ) : Participants functional MRI scan learn task may provide small monetary reward . On first visit , functional MRI , participant take intelligence test base reading aloud word give card . Participants routine magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain within past year also scan . - Part 5 ( one visit ) : Participants take intelligence test base reading aloud word give card . Then , participant TMS follow functional MRI scan . During functional MRI , participants button-pressing task may provide small monetary reward . - Participants also ask provide small blood sample genetic analysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Learning With Reward Healthy Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective Theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TBS ) produce functional change human motor cortex . Continuous inhibitory TBS , ( cTBS ) primary motor cortex ( M1 ) produce temporary impairment learn healthy individual similar see patient traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) Parkinson disease ( PD ) . The depression learn cTBS may serve model learn memory deficit disorder provide mean screen treatment efficacy explore mechanism . Our immediate goal see whether manipulation behavioral contingency task , particularly add reward , overcome virtual lesion produce cTBS . The first aim project examine inhibitory effect cTBS implicit ( serial reaction time /SRT ) explicit ( trial-and-error ) motor learn sequence target location . The second aim project examine effect cTBS non-motor implicit explicit probabilistic classification learn use weather prediction task ( WPT ) . We investigate involvement M1 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) implicit explicit learn study participant perform task follow cTBS : 1 ) M1 , 2 ) DLPFC 3 ) sham TBS . Our third aim examine effect manipulate reward implicit explicit learn follow inhibitory TBS M1 DLPFC possible learn deficit cause TBS improve increase amount reinforcement learning . Our fourth aim examine neural network underlie implicit explicit learn without reward study participant perform task functional MRI ( fMRI ) . Finally , also perform fMRI implicit sequence learn cTBS M1 identify effect neural network involve implicit learning . Study population Healthy volunteer ( n = 272 , age 18 70 ) , without contraindication TBS MRI . This number include 60 participant Experiments 1 2 , 24 participant Experiments 3-5 . In addition , 35 participant include pilot behavioral imaging procedure . In order account potential dropout withdrawal ( 20 % ) , total accrual ceiling include 45 participant equal 272 . Design The study contain five , mixed crossover design experiment appropriate control eliminate order effect . Outcome measure We examine effect reward TBS interaction measure learn . Secondary outcome measure TBS reward interact alter pattern BOLD activation MRI effect relevant genetic variation learning variable BOLD activation . We examine effect genetic variation relevant gene outcome .</detailed_description>
