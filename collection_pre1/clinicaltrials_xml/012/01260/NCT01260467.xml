	<criteria>Patients histologically proven World Health Organization ( WHO ) grade IV glioma . Patients eligible original histology grade II grade III glioma long subsequent histological diagnosis grade IV glioma confirm . Patients must show unequivocal radiographic evidence tumor progression magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . A scan performed within 10 day prior registration steroid dose stable least 5 day . If steroid dose increase date image registration new baseline MRI require . Patients prior therapy include interstitial brachytherapy stereotactic radiosurgery ( include gammaknife cyberknife ) must confirmation true progressive disease rather radiation necrosis base upon either positron emission tomography ( PET ) Thallium scanning , magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) , magnetic resonance perfusion , surgical documentation disease . The decision modality use make confirmation discretion investigator . All patient must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study . Patients must sign authorization release protect health information . Age great 18 year old , life expectancy great 8 week . Karnofsky Performance Status great equal 60 Patients must interval least 28 day investigational agent prior cytotoxic therapy , 6 week prior nitrosureas , 3 week procarbazine 2 week vincristine . Patients must fail prior radiotherapy must interval great 42 day completion initial radiation therapy study entry 28 day since radiation therapy use recurrent tumor . Since memantine associate myelosuppression , patient persistent effect bone marrow function prior cytotoxic chemotherapy eligible long : white blood cell &gt; 1,000/Âµl , absolute neutrophil count &gt; 500/mm3 , platelet count &gt; 50,000/mm3 , hemoglobin &gt; 8 gm/dl ) . Patients must adequate liver function adequate renal function start therapy . These test must perform within 2 week prior treatment initiation . Eligibility level hemoglobin may reach transfusion . Patients must calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 30 milliliters/minute . Patients within 3 month treatment radiation concurrent temozolomide eligible unless new enhance abnormality outside high dose radiation field ( i.e beyond 80 % isodose line ) surgical demonstration active tumor . Patients must pregnant must agree practice adequate contraception . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test document within 7 day prior registration . Women must breastfeed . Patients history cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer cancer cervix ) , unless complete remission least 3 year ineligible . Patients must significant medical illness history investigator 's opinion adequately control appropriate therapy would compromise patient 's ability tolerate therapy . Patients must disease obscure toxicity dangerously alter drug metabolism . Patients must prior concurrent use memantine treatment Nmethyl Dasparate ( NMDA ) receptor block therapy . Active drug alcohol use dependence , opinion investigator , would interfere adherence study requirement . Inability unwillingness subject legal guardian/representative give write informed consent .</criteria>
