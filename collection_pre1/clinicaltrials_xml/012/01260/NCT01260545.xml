	<criteria>Male female subject age ≥ 18 year age Subject must relapsed/refractory leukemia standard therapy anticipate result durable remission . Subjects previously treat highrisk myelodysplasia ( MDS ) ( Intermediate 2 highrisk IPSS ) chronic myelomonocytic leukemia2 ( CMML2 WHO classification ) also candidate protocol . Relapsed/refractory leukemias include acute nonlymphocytic leukemia ( AML ) WHO classification , acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) blast crisis . Subjects myelofibrosis also eligible . Untreated patient diagnosis consider unfit standard therapy also eligible . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 03 . Women child bear potential ( i.e. , woman premenopausal surgically sterile ) must use acceptable contraceptive method ( abstinence , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , oral contraceptive double barrier device ) , must negative urine pregnancy test within 2 week prior begin treatment trial . Nursing subject exclude . Sexually active men must also use acceptable contraceptive method duration time study . Pregnant nursing subject exclude effect CA18C3 fetus nursing child unknown . In absence rapidly progress disease , interval prior treatment time study drug administration least 2 week cytotoxic agent , least 5 halflives noncytotoxic agent . If subject hydroxyurea control peripheral blood leukemic cell count , subject must hydroxyurea least ¬48 hour initiation treatment protocol . Persistent clinically significant toxicity prior chemotherapy must great grade 1 . Subjects must follow clinical laboratory value ( unless range value consider result leukemic organ involvement ) : 1 . Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl . 2 . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x upper limit normal unless consider due Gilbert 's syndrome . 3 . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 3x upper limit normal unless consider due organ leukemic involvement . Signed date institutional review board ( IRB ) approve informed consent protocolspecific screening procedure perform . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited uncontrolled infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Active heart disease include myocardial infarction within previous 3 month , symptomatic coronary artery disease , arrhythmias control medication , uncontrolled congestive heart failure . Subjects receive standard investigational treatment hematologic malignancy . Subjects time evaluation participation study evidence active leukemic involvement brain spinal cord ( CNS ) . Dementia alter mental status would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent Subjects immunocompromised due process unrelated leukemic disease treatment , include subject know infected human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) Subjects detectable level endogenous antibody IL1α time screening .</criteria>
