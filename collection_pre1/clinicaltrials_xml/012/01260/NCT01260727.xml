	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response HIV Vaccine Followed Booster , Administered Two Devices , HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite advance treatment , HIV/AIDS rate remain high low- middle-income country resource-limited area world . Preventive HIV vaccine would effective way decrease spread HIV/AIDS . This study evaluate experimental HIV preventive vaccine follow booster : PENNVAX-G DNA vaccine Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Chiang Mai Double Recombinant ( MVA-CMDR ) booster vaccine . The MVA virus mild form vaccinia virus use smallpox vaccine cause smallpox infection . It safely use vaccine many year . Study researcher examine combination two vaccine provide effective way body build defense HIV . The PENNVAX-G vaccine administer participant use one two devices—the Biojector 2000 needleless device CELLECTRA intramuscular ( IM ) electroporation ( EP ) device—to evaluate immune response vaccine change base device use . The purpose study evaluate safety immunogenicity PENNVAX-G vaccine , administer either Biojector 2000 injection CELLECTRA EP , follow MVA-CMDR vaccine boost , healthy , HIV-uninfected adult . This study conduct two part . Participants first part study attend baseline study visit , undergo blood urine collection , medical history review , physical examination , HIV test counseling . All participant receive PENNVAX-G vaccine baseline Day 28 . They randomly assign receive vaccine either Bioinjector 2000 needleless device CELLECTRA IM EP device . On Days 84 168 , participant receive MVA-CMDR vaccine IM injection deliver via needle syringe . Participants remain clinic 1 hour vaccination observation vital sign monitoring , record temperature symptoms diary 7 day vaccination . Study staff contact participant 1 2 day vaccination follow-up monitoring . In addition vaccination study visit , participant attend study visit Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 13 , 14 , 25 , 26 , 37 , 50 , 52 repeat baseline study procedure . At conclusion first part study , participant ' study data review safety vaccine regimen determine . If regimen find safe , second part study begin . Participants second part study randomly assign receive PENNVAX-G vaccine administer either Bioinjector 2000 device CELLECTRA EP device baseline Day 28 , follow MVA-CDMR boost Days 84 168 , receive placebo PENNVAX-G vaccine administer either Bioinjector 2000 device CELLECTRA EP device baseline Day 28 , follow placebo MVA-CDMR boost Days 84 168 . All study visit procedure occur first part study also take place second part study . Participants second part study option enrol substudy . The purpose substudy evaluate antibody response reproductive tract mucosa PENNVAX-G DNA , MVA-CDMR , placebo vaccine administer main part study . The substudy also evaluate effectiveness use Instead Softcup collection method collect vaginal secretion test . Mucosal specimens urine sample collect participant screen visit Week 2 , 6 , 14 , 26 , 50 study visit .</detailed_description>
