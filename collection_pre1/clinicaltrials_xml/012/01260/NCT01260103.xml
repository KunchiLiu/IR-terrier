	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives To compare progression free survival ( PFS ) , time randomization progressive disease , child optic pathway glioma ( OPG ) age ≥ 6 month &lt; 18 year , receive combination antineoplaston therapy ( ANP therapy ) vs. temozolomide ( TMZ ) ; study subject 1 ) receive prior treatment carboplatin cisplatin , terminate secondary toxicity progression OPG , 2 ) develop recurrence OPG completion carboplatin cisplatin therapy . PFS data censor date last tumor assessment document absence progression study subject : - Who alive , study progression-free time analysis ; - Who discontinue , receive subsequent therapy progression-free time analysis ; - Who given/change therapy study treatment prior observe progression ; - Who discontinue ( due personal preference toxicity ) change therapy , withdraw , lose follow-up ; - For documentation disease progression death occur ≥ 2 consecutive miss tumor assessment . - To describe toxicity profile ANP therapy vs. TMZ . Secondary Objectives : - To compare overall survival ( OS ) subject treated ANP therapy vs. TMZ ; - To compare disease stabilization rate subject treat ANP therapy vs. TMZ ; - To compare complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) , progressive disease ( PD ) rate subject treat ANP therapy vs. TMZ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3 Study ANP Therapy vs. TMZ Optic Pathway Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , phase 3 , open-label , multicenter , protocol study child age ≥ 6 month &lt; 18 yr. , recurrent and/or progressive OPG 1 ) receive prior treatment carboplatin cisplatin , terminate secondary toxicity progression OPG 2 ) develop recurrence OPG completion carboplatin cisplatin therapy . A total 158 subject enrol randomize equally one two therapy group : ANP therapy ( 79 subject ) TMZ ( 79 subject ) . If average 4 subject enrolled month , enrollment complete 3 year 3 month . There additional three year follow-up . Children either gender racial/ethnic group eligible protocol study meet criterion outline Section 3 . Upon determination eligibility , include obtain informed consent , study subject randomize ANP therapy TMZ . The randomization stratify prior RT ( Y/N ) , hypothalamic involvement ( Y/N ) age ( &lt; 5 year / ≥ 5 year ) . In group child treat TMZ develop progressive and/or recurrent disease follow first-line chemotherapy , 2-year PFS 49 % 4-year PFS 31 % report Gururangan associate . Based result , assume exponential distribution , least square estimate hazard 0.333 per year . For study subject , BRI Phase 2 study ANP therapy OPG , 1 ) receive prior treatment carboplatin cisplatin , terminate secondary toxicity progression OPG 2 ) develop recurrence OPG completion carboplatin ( cisplatin ) therapy , least square estimate hazard 0.075 per year . Since sample size Phase 2 study small may overstate effect ANP therapy general use , hazard 0.167 per year utilized determine sample size propose Phase 3 protocol study , give hazard ratio ( TMZ : ANP ) 2.0 . The primary efficacy hypothesis propose protocol study ANP therapy provide significantly well PFS TMZ . This protocol study event-driven ( PD death cause ) , complete 90 event occur . The required sample size treatment group 79 . A log rank test equality survival curve , 0.05 two-sided significance level , 90 % power detect difference PFS child treat ANP therapy vs. child treat TMZ . Assuming accrual rate 4 subject per month , accrual period 3 year 3 month . There additional 3 year follow-up . A common exponential dropout rate 0.05 per year assume . This study utilize intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis . It event-driven ( PD death cause ) , complete 90 event occur . All subject evaluable PFS time randomization time PD death , regardless therapy group , eligibility , adequacy follow-up . All study subject receive least one dose ANP therapy TMZ evaluable safety .</detailed_description>

At recommended therapeutic dose , effect ANP therapy develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior protocol study entry duration protocol study eligible . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participate protocol study , inform treat physician immediately . 10 . Children able understand write informed consent document , willing sign , eligible . A subject parent guardian able understand write informed consent document , willing sign subject 's behalf , eligible . 1 . Children receive prior ANP TMZ therapy eligible . 2 . Children uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , uncontrolled hypertension ( &gt; grade 2 ) psychiatric illness and/or social situation would limit compliance protocol study requirement eligible . 3 . Children history congestive heart failure , deep venous thrombosis , cardiovascular renal condition would contradict administration high dose intravenous sodium insertion subclavian venous catheter eligible . 4 .
