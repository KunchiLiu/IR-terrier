	<brief_summary>The objective pilot study compare PFS-eluting stent ( ISAR Rapa G1 ) PPS-eluting stent ( Cypher® ) regard uncovered stent strut segment 5 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Test Long-Term Safety Efficacy Sirolimus-Permanent-Polymer Eluting Stent ( Cypher ) - Sirolimus-Polymer-free Eluting Stents ( PPS/PFS ) Assessed Optical Coherence Tomography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mid-term efficacy drug-eluting stent well-established , ongoing debate potential increase incidence late stent thrombosis , particularly discontinuation thienopyridine therapy , well delay onset restenosis catch-up phenomenon permanent polymer-based DES . The extent strut coverage reduction expose thrombogenic material show associated inflammatory reaction grade incidence stent thrombosis . The optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) intravascular image modality base light . The principle similar intravascular ultrasound , due much short wave length light , offer much good resolution 10µm , enable exact determination strut coverage , neointimal thickness , vessel size , presence dissection , even presence inflammation . Patients receive polymer-free permanent-polymer sirolimus-eluting stent 5 year ago without in-segment intervention since , evaluate OCT regard heal pattern late lumen loss stent .</detailed_description>
