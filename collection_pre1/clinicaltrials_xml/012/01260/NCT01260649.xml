	<brief_summary>Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) , consider effective treatment severe treatment resistant major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , require 3 week treatment cause considerable acute deficit memory . It would major advance treatment ECT could work faster few treatment result decrease incidence memory problem . Ketamine excellent candidate augmentation ECT acute effect depression , short half-life , safety profile give low dos . Ketamine give infusion could easily incorporate routine management patient undergo ECT , never evaluate prospectively context . The investigator propose assess efficacy , feasibility , tolerability safety N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist augmentation ECT use ketamine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>N-methyl-D-aspartate Antagonist ( Ketamine ) Augmentation Electroconvulsive Treatment Severe Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim # 1 : To assess efficacy ketamine augmentation reduce time remission major depressive episode ( MDE ) . Aim # 2 : To assess efficacy ketamine augmentation ECT-related cognitive side effect . Aim # 3 : To assess feasibility , safety , tolerability ketamine augmentation ECT . Exploratory aim # 4 : We propose assess pattern functional connectivity , ECT use standard clinical EEG good characterize effect ECT correlate clinical effect change EEG measurement . Thirty ( 30 ) participant recruit 24 month . Participants male female , age 18-60 , severe MDD ( baseline score HAM_D-28 &gt; = 20 ) deem appropriate ECT treatment treat physician , agree receive ECT treatment part clinical care , able provide inform consent . Exclusion criteria DSM-IV primary diagnosis include major depressive disorder psychotic feature , bipolar disorder , schizoaffective disorder , schizophrenia , dementia , history psychosis , substance use disorder ( abuse dependence active use within last 6 month ) , lifetime history ketamine abuse dependence , organic mental disorder , seizure disorder chronic antiepileptic medication , severe unstable medical illness , pregnancy . Study procedure : eligible patient randomize double-blind administration ketamine ( 0.5 mg/kg ) saline first three ECT treatment . Right Unilateral ECT ( RUL-ECT ) administer 6 time seizure threshold , use d'Elia placement electrode . Electroconvulsive therapy give 3 time per week , per standard care MGH . Depression severity assess weekly HAM-D 28 ( main outcome measure ) , administer clinician blind randomization . The neuropsychological assessment battery design include instrument sensitive cognitive impairment associate depression general ECT treatment particular repeat baseline , end acute treatment series 3 month follow-up . Also patient undergo repeat EEG monitoring , baseline one week treatment follow aim possibly identify EEG feature associate response .</detailed_description>
