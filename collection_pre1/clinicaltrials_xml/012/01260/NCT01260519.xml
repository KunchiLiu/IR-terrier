	<brief_title>Effect Heparin Femoral Arterial Sheaths Thrombosis During Diagnostic Coronary Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE : The purpose study evaluate incidence blood clot femoral arterial sheath coronary angiographic procedure effect heparin administration thrombus formation . BACKGROUND : A heparinized saline flush use diagnostic coronary angiography prevent thrombus formation within lumen sheath . However , use prophylactic intravenous heparin follow femoral arterial sheath insertion controversial . The aim study evaluate effectiveness 2000 unit heparin intravenous bolus versus saline placebo thrombus formation within arterial sheath diagnostic coronary angiography . Methods A randomize control trial examine efficacy intravenous heparin bolus compare placebo prevention femoral arterial sheath thrombus formation patient undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography . The study include adult patient undergoing cardiac catheterization . Eligible patient recruit day-case in-patients ward Prince Sultan Cardiac Centre ( PSCC ) , Riyadh . Patients abnormal coagulation profile , abnormal platelet count receive enoxaparin , glycoprotein IIb/IIa antagonists exclude . Since coronary intervention require anticoagulation procedure , study interested diagnostic part . After insertion femoral arterial sheath one group allocate 2 milliliter solution contain 2000 unit heparin group similar amount placebo solution blind patient operate catheterization laboratory staff . Arterial access obtain via femoral approach 6F 7F Sheaths use . The femoral sheath aspirate flushed presence thrombus obstruction catheter exchange end procedure . Two step aspiration perform 5 cc blood extract one syringe another saline fill syringe use flushing . We use clean white gauze look presence thrombus , thrombus notice aspiration perform followed saline flush . Any visible thrombus stage procedure consider positive . The patient evaluate assess clinically hospital stay presence leg ischemia , Femoral Pedal pulse , Local hematoma bleeding . All patient give inform consent , study protocol approve PSCC Ethics Committee . Randomization Patients randomize base catheterization laboratory flow , first laboratory assign treatment number one second laboratory assign treatment number two alternate day , seal label syrinx contain treatment allocation come pharmacy daily basis handle independent laboratory staff nurse assign maintain conceal patient healthcare provider Throughout study . The label uncover open femoral puncture arterial sheath insertion confirm patient provide write informed consent participate study . Once seal broken , patient consider irrevocably randomize . Study Interventions Patients randomize receive either heparin placebo . Patients heparin group receive 2000 unit ( 2 ml ) unfractionated heparin intravenous bolus . Those randomized placebo receive 2ml saline base solution intravenous bolus . The femoral sheath aspirate flushed presence thrombus obstruction catheter exchange end procedure . Two step aspiration perform 5 cc blood extract one syringe another saline fill syringe use flushing . We use clean white gauze look presence thrombus , thrombus notice aspiration perform followed saline flush . Any visible thrombus stage procedure consider positive . The patient evaluate assess clinically hospital stay presence leg ischemia , Femoral Pedal pulse , Local hematoma bleeding . Outcomes The primary end point occurrence arterial sheath thrombus , define Any visible thrombus sheath blood aspiration stage procedure . The second primary end point efficacy intravenous heparin bolus reduce risk thrombus formation . Patients monitor embolic bleed event discharge hospital . Embolic event define appearance symptom sign acute limb ischemia like acute leg pain loss pedal pulse result interventional surgical exploration . Bleeding event define local femoral access bleed hematoma lead surgical exploration . The diagnosis embolization hematoma make clinically ( loss arterial pulse evidence leg ischemia ) confirm Doppler study appropriate . Outcomes assess patient ' treat physician , aware treatment assignment .</detailed_description>
