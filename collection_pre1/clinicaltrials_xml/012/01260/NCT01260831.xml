	<brief_title>Evaluating Processes Care &amp; Outcomes Children Hospital ( EPOCH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Bedside Paediatric Early Warning System ( Bedside PEWS ) scientifically develop documentation-based system care design identify child clinically deteriorate admit hospital inpatient ward . It develop validated applicant . The investigator preliminary data demonstrate Bedside PEWS address multiple factor ( communication , hierarchy , secondary review ) contribute delay treatment child risk . In pilot study implementation single site investigator show statistically significant reduction late transfer , 'stat ' call , decrease apprehension nurse call physician review patient , improve communication . Our preliminary data show Bedside PEWS score superior method use identify child risk impend cardiopulmonary arrest . A 2-year cluster-randomized trial evaluate impact Bedside PEWS clinical outcome , process care resource utilization 22 paediatric hospital .</detailed_description>

A METRRT define identify team one train healthcare professional report service PICU physician , perform urgent consultation hospital inpatient . For inpatient ward : area care provide patient admitted hospital , PICU , operate room , designate area anaesthetistsupervised procedure perform . All eligible inpatient ward participate study . For patient : Within eligible hospital study patient old 37 week gestational age le 18 year admit eligible inpatient ward , receive care eligible inpatient area study . For hospital : plan introduce new 'medical emergency team ' study , severity illness score ( Brighton , Cardiff , PEWS , Bedside PEWS unpublished score ) use ward area hospital randomization deem acceptable . These exclusion criterion ensure major system change include introduction METRRT , new documentation system , physician staffing , hospital capacity bias result . For patient : less 37 week gestational age throughout hospitalization care exclusively NICU child admit directly PICU die PICU discharge thus receive care eligible inpatient ward</criteria>
