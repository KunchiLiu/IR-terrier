	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study side effect well give cediranib maleate together without dasatinib work treat patient hormone-resistant prostate cancer resistant treatment docetaxel . Cediranib maleate dasatinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether give cediranib maleate together dasatinib alone effective treatment prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cediranib Maleate With Without Dasatinib Patients With Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer Resistant Treatment With Docetaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free survival patient docetaxel-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer treat cediranib maleate versus without dasatinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To confirm safety tolerability cediranib maleate versus without dasatinib patient . II . To calculate objective response rate cediranib maleate versus without dasatinib , accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion , patient measurable disease baseline . III . To perform symptom assessment use FACT-P questionnaire Present Pain Intensity ( PPI ) scale McGill-Melzack questionnaire . IV . To explore bone resorption marker ( e.g. , c-telopeptide bone alkaline phosphatase ) , correlate biomarkers clinical outcome . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord presence soft tissue ( visceral nodal ) vs bone-only disease . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oral cediranib maleate daily oral dasatinib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive cediranib maleate arm I . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
