	<brief_title>The Role Combination Nutraceuticals Control Cardiovascular Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study role combination nutraceuticals ( Armolipid Prev ) effect blood pressure lipid control cardiovascular risk . APv - cpr - 0210 1 . Study rationale The strategy prevention cardiovascular disease always involve correction wrong lifestyle habit , whereas use pharmacological treatment recommend patient high cardiovascular risk . This approach obviously leave wide proportion population low-moderate cardiovascular risk could benefit early BP-lowering treatment development organ damage become irreversible , high-risk hypertensive patient , even intense cardiovascular therapy , beneficial , nonetheless unable low total cardiovascular risk high risk threshold . In set cardiovascular prevention , presence metabolic syndrome result particularly relevant , since affect large percentage population demonstrate increase risk cardiovascular event . However mere lifestyle recommendation , despite useful , always reach establish blood pressure metabolic goal reduce global cardiovascular risk . Moreover , cardiovascular risk show increase increase blood pressure value , result mandatory achieve low blood pressure goal , take account drug always side effect dangerous and/or uncomfortable patient lead reduced compliance . Thus , pharmacological treatment start really necessary . The availability natural substance therapeutic action alter scenario reduce potential cause undesirable effect ( compare drug ) . In order choose among various nutraceuticals ( natural food compound health benefit , include prevention and/or treatment disease ) , preference give - produce accord Good Manufacturing Practice use drug , sure finish product standard , reproducible composition - efficacy safety recommend indication support clinical trial . An example product meet criteria Armolipid Plus , combination nutraceuticals allow control dyslipidaemia . Recently , large clinical intervention study show evidence treatment Armolipid Plus lead significant decrease overall cardiovascular risk , measure Framingham Risk Score . Progress Research Development field lead new patent registered combination nutraceuticals : Armolipid Prev , contain orthosiphon CoQ10 , antihypertensive activity , berberine , red yeast , policosanol orthosiphon antidyslipidaemic effect folic acid , reduce plasma homocysteine level . In addition establish anti-dyslipidaemic activity Armolipid plus , Armolipid Prev significant antihypertensive effect , beneficial patient high blood pressure value without define indication begin pharmacological treatment accord current guideline . The antihypertensive effect Armolipid Prev , document ambulatory blood pressure monitoring , addition lower effect dyslipidaemia even abdominal girth , represent new opportunity complete early , effective safe cardiovascular disease prevention . In fact , association balance diet healthy lifestyle , Armolipid Prev encourage subject improve lifestyle , thereby delay need lipid-lowering drug . Armolipid Prev classify Ministry Health food supplement Notification 29th January 2010 . 2 . AIM OF THE STUDY Aim study evaluate efficacy nutraceutical Armolipid Prev compare simple advice diet healthy lifestyle : - achieve great reduction overall cardiovascular risk - reduce incidence metabolic syndrome - reduce prevalence microalbuminuria - reduce prevalence leave ventricular hypertrophy evaluate ECG - increase compliance adopt healthy lifestyle . 3 . STUDY DESIGN Multicentre , randomize , control parallel-group study . 4 . STUDY POPULATION At least 150 doctor take part study ; treat least 10 subject gender diagnosis metabolic syndrome require blood pressure control without define indication start pharmacological treatment stable drug therapy achieve establish result . Indicators : GPs require : 1 ) record full medical history , include smoke drinking habit , base pre-defined clinical record ; 2 ) collect demographic anthropometric measure ( height , weight , waist circumference iliac crest ) ; 3 ) perform complete physical exam . At first visit 1 , 3 12 month eligible patient perform complete physical exam include measure office blood pressure heart rate sit position triplicate , use manual sphygmomanometer , accord international guideline . Measurements round close 2 mmHg interval . The baseline visit others screen visit also include examination cell blood count ( CBCs ) , serum creatinine , sodium , potassium , uric acid , total cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL-cholesterol , glucose , GOT , GPT , CPK , urine analysis microalbuminuria . LDL calculate start total cholesterol , triglyceride HDL-cholesterol . At first visit end follow patient evaluate presence Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) cardiovascular risk assessment use Framingham cardiovascular risk score . Metabolic syndrome define presence least 3 follow 5 factor : increase blood pressure ( ≥ 130/85 ≤ 140/90 mmHg ) ; serum triglyceride ≥ 150 mg/dL ; serum HDL cholesterol ≤ 40 mg/dL ( male ) , ≤ 50 mg/dL ( female ) ; abdominal girth ≥ 104 cm ( male ) , ≥ 88 cm ( female ) ; elevate fast blood glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL . Hypertension define accord 2003 ESH/ESC guideline Diagnosis Left Ventricular Hypertrophy assess use current ECG criterion ( Sokolow-Lyon index : S V1 + R V5 V6 ≥ 35 mm R aVL ≥ 11 mm ; Cornell voltage criterion ( S V3 + R aVL &gt; 28 mm men S V3 + R aVL &gt; 20 mm woman ) baseline end follow-up . Cardiovascular risk calculate accord Framingham risk score baseline end follow-up . The follow excluded treatment : diabetic hypertensive subject indication treatment , patient lipid-lowering treatment accord Package Leaflet , pregnant breast-feeding woman . Patients require cholesterol-lowering drug therapy , accord international guideline , include study population . The primary endpoint improvement estimate cardiovascular risk calculate FRS . Secondary endpoint : Reduction incident metabolic syndrome Reduction prevalence subject microalbuminuria Reduction prevalence leave ventricular hypertrophy ECG . 4.1 . Sample size According result previous study perform efficacy Armolipid Plus ( -12 % reduction FRS 8 week compare -6.5 % diet alone ) , approximate estimate make number observation necessary two percentage significant 5 % probability level : 600 case group . 5 . TREATMENTS subject receive dietary counseling determine general practitioner depend subject 's clinical condition , accordance instruction Coordinating Site . Centralized randomization use assign subject one two study treatment , placebo + diet Armolipid Prev + diet . How Armolipid Prev take 1 tablet daily Armolipid Prev placebo . Duration treatment Subjects group take assign treatment 12 month . 6 . EVALUATION CRITERIA At first visit 1 , 3 , 12 month blood pressure value lipid profile assess well others clinical parameter necessary evaluate cardiovascular risk evaluate diagnosis metabolic syndrome . In order standardize measurement , doctor give sphygmomanometer tape measure estimate abdominal girth . 7 . STUDY PROCEDURES Each doctor initially give login password allow confidential individual access website www.armolipid.net data entry . The doctor complete appropriate form ( also available armolipid.net site ) assign subject one two regimen : placebo + diet Armolipid Prev + diet , base determine centralised randomization responsibility Prof. Bruno Trimarco . This procedure undertake telephone call Randomization Centre , automatically inform doctor treatment subject assign order keep balance ratio two group . In order avoid sample error , doctor include study first 10 consecutive subject meet admission criterion ( see point 4 ) . 8 . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The statistical analysis baseline homogeneity undertaken use chi-square test analysis variance , appropriate . The statistical analysis ass clinical efficacy base comparison difference various time point versus baseline obtain two treatment group conduct use chi-square test analysis variance , appropriate . The level significance consider Alfa = 0.05 ( type I error ) power level beta = 0.90 ( type II error ) . 9 . INSURANCE COVER This protocol cover insurance policy take AXA Assicurazioni e Investimenti , policy no.100720 ( Milan Branch ) . The insurance cover injury health sustain patient economic damage arising , occur period policy valid , renew year year basis . 10 . STUDY TIMELINES The study start time login password deliver . 11 .
