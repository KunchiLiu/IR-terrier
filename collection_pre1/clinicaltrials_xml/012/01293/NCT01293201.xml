	<brief_summary>The overall development plan show combination tried-and-proven decongestant/antihistamine ingredient ( pseudoephedrine hydrochloride chlorpheniramine maleate ) , plus small amount belladonna alkaloid ( .24 mg atropine sulfate ) comprehensive , safe effective B.I.D . drug treatment regimen , indicated relief symptom associate seasonal allergic rhinitis adult child 12 year age old . Treated symptom include nasal congestion , sneeze , rhinorrhea , itchy nose , itchy/watery eye , post nasal drip syndrome [ reduction tickly cough ( acute chronic ) , mucus back throat , sore throat , hoarseness ] . Considering favorable safety efficacy result Phase 1 Phase 2 , purpose Phase 3 ass compare safety efficacy study drug large group comparatively placebo control group . Objectives : A ) To report compare total symptom score ( TSS ) SAR subject rating efficacy STAHIST vs. placebo relieve nasal congestion , rhinorrhea , nasal itching , sneeze , post-nasal drip two-week study period . B ) Report side effect adverse drug reaction rate severity incident . C ) Compare report symptom score , total nasal symptom score ( TNSS ) , post-nasal drip symptom score ( PND-S ) two study arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phase 3 clinical trial conduct conformance Good Clinical Practices multi-center , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study evaluate safety efficacy STAHIST ( IMP ) 300 adult adolescent subject 12-60 year age , either sex race minimum 2-year history seasonal allergic rhinitis ( SAR ) baseline minimum total symptom score ( TSS ) less 8 S5 Subject Diary . Subjects treat twice daily IMP placebo period two week . Subjects visit study site least 4 visit : screening , randomization/study inception , end-of-week one , final visit , unscheduled visit appropriate . Run In ( washout period ) : Subjects require stop use oral nasal decongestant first generation antihistamine 48 hour , second generation antihistamine Singulair seven day , systemic corticosteroid 30 day , nasal ocular corticosteroid medication two week . Use drug also allow study . The first dose administer study site subject monitor on-site one hour follow dosing . There 24-hour on-call telephone access physician/office staff study subject . A Study Flow Chart use facilitate trial management , record complete task well document time completion ( See Study Flow Chart Source Documentsâ€”Appendix D ) . Safety evaluation include monitor subject-reported AEs , measurement vital sign , assessment safety laboratory data . Qualified independent , non-study administration individual select prior start treatment purpose safety monitoring . 300 subject randomize . Assuming screen failure test rate approximately 33 % , approximately 450 subject screen . At conclusion study , CSR prepare Sponsor , review approve Principal/Coordinator Investigator submission .</detailed_description>
