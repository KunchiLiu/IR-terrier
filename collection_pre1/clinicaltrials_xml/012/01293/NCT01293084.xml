	<brief_summary>Previously , investigator others show mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) defective patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) think alteration airway mucus rheology figure prominently impairment . Mucociliary clearance work trap toxic particle , bacteria virus lung mucus quickly remove mucus lung . Defects MCC typically lead accumulation mucus airway , turn associate acute infection , chronic bacterial colonization chronic inflammation . One treatment strategy gain acceptance important therapy improve MCC adult CF inhalation osmotic stimulus , hypertonic saline ( HS ) . A number study show acute inhalation HS ( 7 % saline ) significantly improve MCC adult CF result recent study indicate two week inhale HS lead significant increase MCC sustain 8 hour post inhalation associate significant improvement FEV1 , FVC FEF25-75 value . Since MCC patient CF appear impaired adulthood , drug disrupts slow impairment childhood could prove enormously beneficial long-term prognosis disease . Nevertheless , study conduct determine HS treatment improve MCC child CF . This problematic physician care child CF normal FEV1 FVC value , since unclear treat child HS . This research study design begin answer question . The investigator hypothesize acute inhalation hypertonic saline ( 7 % ) improve MCC CF child normal pulmonary function . Our hypothesis test one-year clinical trial randomize placebo-controlled . Twelve child CF 7-12 year old normal FEV1 FVC value participate . Our goal compare MCC child two study visit acute inhalation placebo ( 0.12 % saline ) hypertonic saline ( HS ) ( 7 % saline ) aerosol . The investigator predict MCC value acute inhalation 7 % HS aerosol statistically significantly great placebo inhalation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several study report mucociliary clearance ( MCC ) impair adult CF . Because MCC important airway defense mechanism , drug slow impairment MCC child could prove beneficial long-term prognosis disease . A study show inhalation hypertonic saline ( HS ) significantly improve MCC adult CF improvement associate increase pulmonary function decrease pulmonary exacerbation . Nevertheless , study examine HS improves MCC CF child . This problematic physician care CF child normal pulmonary function , since unclear treat HS . This study design begin answer question . Twelve child CF ( 7-12 yr ; 5 male ) normal pulmonary function ( FEV1 FVC &gt; 90 % predicted value ) participate screen visit two study visit . On screen visit , child undergo induced sputum test . On two study visit , inhale 0.12 % saline ( placebo ) , HS , double-blind , randomize , cross-over study . Following inhalation placebo HS , patient inhale radioisotope 99mtechnetium underwent sequential imaging lung gamma camera 90 min approximately 24 hr later . Mucociliary clearance quantify 60 min ( MCC60 ) , 90 min ( MCC90 ) 24 hr ( MCC24hrs ) inhalation radioisotope . Between 60 min 90 min measurement , child cough 30 time .</detailed_description>
