	<detailed_description>Seriously ill hospitalize elderly patient rate 'not keep alive prolonged life support ' important aspect good quality care end life ( EOL ) . Across Canada , large number elderly patient near EOL family face decision whether use mechanical ventilation form life support technology use intensive care unit ( ICUs ) . The investigator know whether patient family inform reality intensive care - , aware likelihood survive critical illness resultant health state . The outcomes critical illness patient population family unknown , despite crucial importance information guide clinical decision making . The goal research program understand realities critical care , expectation attitudes patient 80 year age old ( 80+ ) family use life sustain technology . Specifically , project , investigator want determine reality outcomes survive critical illness . Our primary research question : 1 . What 12-month health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) , functional status , survival patient admit ICU 80+ year old ? Our secondary research question : 2 . Which patient characteristic associate 12-month HRQOL , functional status , survival ? 3 . What satisfaction family member critical care , measure Family Satisfaction ICU ( FS-ICU 24 ) instrument ? 4 . For patient survive ICU stay , experience family member care patient follow , measure Caregiver Reaction Assessment ( CRA ) instrument ? 5 . For patient survive ICU stay , family satisfaction EOL care , measure use CANHELP Satisfaction ( Bereavement ) instrument ? 6 . What health-related financial burden experience patient caregiver initial ICU hospitalization 12 month index ICU admission ? 7 . What quality decision make regard goal care 80+ ICU patient ? 8 . What value influence decision goal care population ? To answer question , investigator conduct national , multicentre , cohort study 800 patient age 80+ year admit Canadian ICUs . The investigator follow patient prospectively 12 month measure study outcome . In addition , use novel instrument investigator already develop validate , investigator follow family member patient document experience caregiver , satisfaction care relative , financial implication critically ill love one . This quantitative project complement separate qualitative study community set understand expectation attitudes person 80 year age regarding use life sustain technology . Data emerge work inform important clinical decision regard critical care EOL care age population . The investigator presume short- long-term mortality 80+ year old admit Canadian ICUs high self-reported health-related quality life functional status survivor hospital discharge low . The investigator anticipate pre-morbid illness functional status admission ICU correlate long-term clinical outcome . The investigator uncertain psychological financial burden experience family love one ICU recovery phase ; study first furnish important information . By use administrative database complement information already collect study , investigator obtain good understand healthcare resource utilization long term survival cohort , well position offer effective ICU follow-up care at-risk patient population .</detailed_description>
