	<brief_summary>The percentage patient define unresectable metastatic disease benefit first-line treatment enable secondary complete metastasectomy unknown limited . Definition optimize treatment algorithm difficult due inhomogeneous patient population . This open label , multicentre Phase II study primarily aim assess resection rate achievable select patient population initially unresectable metastatic disease limit liver order evaluate feasibility , safety efficacy regard secondary resection hepatic lesion patient . The trial aim enrol patient meeting define criterion unresectability regard hepatic lesion exclude patient extrahepatic lesion order examine appropriate , highly active treatment regimen group unresectable patient high probability successful secondary metastasectomy curative intent . The trial conduct highly specialized centre track record successful interdisciplinary treatment approach field metastatic colorectal cancer allow precise assessment peri-operative safety parameter well evaluation surgical treatment approach . The IXO regimen select study show phase I/II study promise efficacy favourable safety profile . Bevacizumab demonstrate significant survival benefit combination chemotherapy metastatic colorectal cancer . Therefore study allow evaluation potential benefit combination two active current chemotherapy regimens first-line post-operative treatment setting .</brief_summary>
