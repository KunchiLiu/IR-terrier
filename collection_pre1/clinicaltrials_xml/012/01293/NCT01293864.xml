	<detailed_description>Background The skin large organ participates many protective homeostatic process . The function skin roughly divide systemic local ; interrelate relationship poorly understand study require multiscale approach . Particularly , local response mediate activation proteolytic signaling pathway coagulation inflammation , relevant scale corresponds micrometer nanometer dimension cell macromolecule , respectively . There little information physicochemical characteristic skin scale . Objective The investigator propose analyze fresh human skin sample use several up-to-date technology obtain parameter mechanical , biochemical structural distribution main component capillary-tissue unit . Hypothesis/Rationale Our work hypothesis structural component dermis , glycosaminoglycans , key mediator homeostatic pathway , procoagulant tissue factor evenly distribute along parallel plane . The investigator hypothesize distribution pattern determine functional mechanical difference along dermal layer . Methods Using dermatome , human skin dissect along plane parallel epidermis several layer approximately .0012mm thick . The layer analyze respect composition diffusible protein glycosaminoglycans ; subject high resolution MRI AFM scanning ; evaluate swell rate equilibrium swell pressure . Significance This study provide new information material characteristic functional structure human skin resolution relevant macromolecular cellular process mediate local response injury maintain local homeostatic mechanism . The data process obtain realistic parameter need develop predictive model skin capillary tissue unit . These model bring new deep understanding skin physiology pathology aid discovery test new preventive therapeutic approach target dysfunction local homeostatic balance skin . Potentially , exploit versatility mathematical simulation skin model , finding also applicable tissue organ .</detailed_description>
