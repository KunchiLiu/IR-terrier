	<brief_summary>Background : - Docetaxel , commonly use drug treatment invasive breast cancer , show prolong life woman breast cancer prevent cancer spread return . However , docetaxel know cause nerve damage , include numbness , tingle , pain , 50 90 percent breast cancer patient . This nerve damage call peripheral neuropathy , severe treatment docetaxel may need stop . Researchers interested study docetaxel-related nerve damage determine whether certain genetic factor may predispose woman develop condition , closely investigate specific effect docetaxel nervous system Objectives : - To examine nerve damage woman breast cancer treat docetaxel . Eligibility : - Women least 18 year age diagnose invasive breast cancer schedule docetaxel treatment . Design : - Participants screen full medical history physical examination , well blood urine test image study . - This study require seven visit , one start chemotherapy six schedule treatment visit . Study procedures visit take 30 45 minute do parallel schedule chemotherapy visit . - At first visit , participant provide blood sample ; complete questionnaire rate describe exist pain , numbness , tingle hand foot start chemotherapy ; nerve conduction test ; skin biopsy . - At visit follow docetaxel treatment , participant complete questionnaire rate describe pain , numbness , tingle course chemotherapy . Participants provide blood sample every visit nerve conduction test second , fourth , sixth visit . Participants also second skin biopsy , either site appear experience nerve damage ( develop nerve damage symptom ) site near first biopsy location .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( CIPN ) one debilitate side effect neurotoxic chemotherapy , significantly interfere patient quality life ( QOL ) administration antineoplastic therapy . There currently approve safe effective treatment CIPN . This protocol explore molecular-genetic mechanism associate natural history CIPN progression ( 1 ) identification differentially express gene proteins biomarkers onset CIPN ; ( 2 ) evaluation relationship biomarkers severity CIPN observation period , ( 3 ) determine relationship molecular-genetic biomarkers , morphological change small nerve fiber severity neuropathic symptom . Study population : Cancer patient plan receive chemotherapy treatment either taxane class , vinca alkaloid class , platinum compound bortezomib . Design : This prospective , exploratory , natural history study identify molecular-genetic mechanism involve chemotherapy-induced neuropathy cancer patient . A physician-based neuropathy scale , patient neurotoxocity questionnaire , total neuropathy score use measure severity peripheral neuropathy baseline completion cycle chemotherapy infusion . Whole peripheral blood skin biopsy ( patient consent biopsy ) collect baseline subsequent infusion cycle evaluate gene/protein expression immunohistochemical label peripheral site neuropathic injury . Microarray gene expression analysis employ identify differential regulation gene involve development CIPN different time point compare gene expression baseline sample . Genes interest validate qRT-PCR identify novel pharmacological target evaluate future prospective study . Protein level correspond change gene expression evaluate use ELISA verify Western blotting . Outcome measure : The primary outcome study change gene protein expression peripheral blood skin biopsy among cancer patient undergo chemotherapy . The secondary outcome relationship molecular-genetic biomarkers identify presence peripheral neuropathic symptom impact patient QOL .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must meet follow eligible enrollment : Age : 18 year old Both male female cancer patient recruit study . However , data separately assess male female due difference incidence , etiology hormonal dependence may confound final data analysis . Ability provide inform consent Cancer patient schedule undergo chemotherapy taxane class , vinca alkaloid class , platinum compound bortezomib EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients one follow exclude : Unable provide inform consent Have prior radiotherapy Preexisting document neuropathy risk factor neuropathy may confound analysis factor associate CIPN : Diabetes mellitus Uremia Vitamin B12 deficiency Peripheral vascular disease Documented Thyroid dysfunction ongoing treatment . The patient thyroid dysfunction may also manifest peripheral neuropathic symptom numbness tingle foot hand . The medication use treat hypothyroidism may confound study data assessment . Previous history alcoholism ( beriberi ) drug abuse Rheumatoid arthritis Lupus Amyloidosis Sarcoidosis Other druginduced neuropathy may confound analysis associate CIPN : Thalidomide Isoniazid Trichloroethylene Hydralazine Disulfiram Nitrofurantoin</criteria>
