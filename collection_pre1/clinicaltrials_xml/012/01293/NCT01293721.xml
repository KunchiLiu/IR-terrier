	<brief_summary>Osteoporotic hip fracture common elderly . As result age population Hong Kong , total number hip fracture case anticipated increase substantially future , therefore draw resource hospital healthcare cost . Osteoporotic hip fracture usually cause severe pain take long time ( 4-8months ) recover due impair healing capability osteoporotic bone limit mobility . Consequently , patient recover slowly result low physical activity provide inadequate mechanical stimulation . It also know mechanical , vascular biological factor key fracture healing . Low-magnitude , high-frequency vibration ( LMHFV ) treatment biophysical intervention provide whole-body vibration signal mechanical stimulation , proven good enhance bone muscle performance , well blood circulation . Our previous study LMHFV femoral fracture rat show acceleration fracture healing , result enhanced callus formation maturation . Application LMHFV osteoporotic fracture could shorten period complete callus bridge 30 % . Our clinical trial normal elderly also demonstrate improved muscle performance good compliance , also critical factor fracture heal . In study , investigator therefore hypothesize LMHFV enhance hip fracture heal enhance fracture impaction , maintain bone mineral density , enhance muscle recovery , thus improve implant mechanical stability rehabilitation elderly patient . The hip fracture elderly patient recruit randomized control treatment group . They assess fracture heal fixed time point . The finding study provide useful scientific data support application LMHFV hip fracture patients.The ultimate goal enhance fracture heal rehabilitation elderly patient .</brief_summary>
