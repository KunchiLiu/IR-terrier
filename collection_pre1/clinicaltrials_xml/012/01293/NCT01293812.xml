	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION AND JUSTIFICATION Acute pain one common adverse stimulus experience child , occur result injury , illness , necessary medical procedure [ 1 ] . The American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) American Pain Society ( APS ) jointly issue statement promote responsibility paediatrician leader advocate ensure humane competent treatment pain suffer infant , child , adolescent [ 1 ] . In Emergency Departments ( ED ) , child undergo many painful procedure , bladder catheterization , capillary blood test , venipuncture lumbar puncture . All procedure associate increase anxiety , avoidance , somatic symptom , increase parental distress [ 1 ] . Numerous myth , insufficient knowledge among caregiver , inadequate application knowledge contribute lack effective pain management among infant [ 1 ] . Long-term effect unmanaged pain human infant show include permanent impairment element cognitive development , learning , memory , behaviour [ 2 ] , increase somatisation childhood [ 3 ] . The plasticity develop brain change occur response painful stimulus [ 4 ] also contribute altered perception pain later life [ 5-6 ] . Early painful experience affect child 's future responses analgesia . Weisman et al [ 7 ] find inadequate analgesia young child procedure diminish effect adequate analgesia subsequent procedure . Many study suggest prompt accurate recognition treatment pain young infant important immediate comfort best possible lifelong development [ 8 ] . Despite recent interest paediatric pain assessment , prevention treatment , many child receive adequate management alleviate pain [ 1 , 8-9 ] . The ideal pre-procedural analgesic minor invasive procedure would cost-effective , inexpensive , short-acting agent associate risk [ 10 ] . The use sucrose well study certain procedure patient neonatal intensive care unit newborn nursery setting , particularly venous blood draw , capillary blood test circumcision [ 11-13 ] . In study [ 11-13 ] , infant receive oral sucrose solution procedure cry less overall decreased behavioural pain response compare receive placebo . Furthermore , sucrose show safe intervention serious life-threatening adverse event report side effect consist minimal cough administration [ 14 ] . Sucrose inexpensive , short acting , non-sedating , easily administer non-invasive . Administration sucrose require additional training expose infant risk great associate breast bottle feeding . Summaries randomize controlled trial among hospitalized neonate 32 40 week gestation suggest single dose 0,5 2 mL 12 % 50 % sucrose deliver non-nutritive sucking via pacifier 2 minute painful event safe [ 15 ] effective decreasing physiologic ( heart rate , respiratory rate oxygen saturation ) [ 16-17 ] . It also effective minimize behavioural pain indicator ( cry , facial expression motor activity ) [ 16 , 18 ] reduce overall composite pain scale score [ 16 ] . A Cochrane systematic review conclude sucrose safe effective reduce procedural pain single short procedural event neonate , optimal dose could identify due inconsistency effective sucrose dosage among study [ 19 ] . A review publish study report sucrose glucose healthy term preterm infant single episode heel lance , venipuncture intramuscular injection effective [ 20 ] . However , uncertainty remain beyond neonatal period , give limited number publish study [ 20 ] . A grow number study look infant undergoing immunization suggest analgesic effect may extend past neonatal period infancy [ 21-26 ] . Nevertheless , upper limit effect unknown term age appropriate sucrose dosage . Two study examine effectiveness sweet solution analgesic paediatric ED . A randomize control trial emergency set sucrose and/or pacifier infant receive venipuncture conduct Curtis al [ 27 ] among infant 0 6 month demonstrate trend reduce pain among sub-group infant 0 3 month . However , study show difference pain scale 3 month age . Also , study examine effect sucrose bladder catheterization , subgroup infant 1 30 day old received sweet solution show small change pain score , less likely cry catheterization return baseline quickly , comparison placebo group [ 14 ] . However , among child 31 90 day , statistically significant difference. [ 14 ] . Also , study use variety concentration sucrose ( e.g . Rogers use sucrose 24 % [ 14 ] , Curtis use sucrose 44 % [ 27 ] Lewindon use sucrose 75 % [ 24 ] ) . Systematic review current literature unable demonstrate superiority one concentration sweet solution another [ 28 ] , many study suggest high concentration sweet solution seem effective [ 25 , 29-32 ] . Therefore , investigator choose study effect sweet solution name syrup B.P . ( product Laboratoire Atlas inc. ) contain 88 % sucrose . This solution already commonly use population infant 3 month age safe ( e.g . prednisone syrup codeine syrup make use syrup ) . A 2 ml dose 88 % sucrose contains amount carbohydrate 25 ml infant milk formula contain approximately 7,5g/100 ml [ 33 ] . Also , 88 % sucrose concentration sugar many medication commonly use infant , oral antibiotic , oral steroid solution pain medication ( e.g . codeine syrup ) . This syrup particular interest low cost ( $ 9,58 bottle 2000 ml ) , universally available , stable viable approximately three month . Therefore , procedure study would easy apply clinical setting . Finally , painful procedure choose study venipuncture ( indwell catheter without draw blood sample ) . Venipunctures frequently perform ED age group . In fact , study center , CHU Ste-Justine , approximately 15 patient 1 3 month require venipuncture part investigation month . To date , pain scale validate precisely age group study project . However , Face , Legs , Activity , Cry Consolability ( FLACC ) scale recommend IMMPACT group ( Initiative Methods , Measurement Pain Assessment Clinical Trials ) [ 34 ] . FLACC easily applicable pain scale observer score patient 5 category , 0 2 point , total score maximum 10 point ( Table 1 ) . The validity reliability pain scale establish past child 2 month 7 year [ 35 ] . Validity evaluate compare FLACC scale Objective Pain Scale demonstrate tool show similar behaviour ( r=0.80 ; p &lt; 0.001 ) [ 35 ] . The interrater reliability 2 observer consider good ( r [ 87 ] =0.94 ; p &lt; 0.001 ) kappa value great 0,50 category [ 35 ] . Therefore , pain scale chosen measure primary outcome , population infant 1 3 month old . Furthermore , Neonatal Infant Pain Scale ( NIPS ) [ 36 ] ( Table 2 ) well validate pain scale newborn 1 month age [ 37 ] . This pain scale choose secondary outcome . The investigator hypothesize use one pain scale validate infant 1 month age another validate infant old 2 month age allow u assess pain infant 1 3 month age best , give current available tool . Furthermore , several patient parameter use corroborate finding . HYPOTHESIS The investigator believe provide oral sucrose solution venipuncture decrease pain level infants 1 3 month age . OBJECTIVES Our primary objective compare efficacy oral 88 % sucrose solution placebo solution reduce pain assess Face , Legs , Activity , Cry Consolability scale child 1 3 month venipuncture Emergency Department ( ED ) . Our secondary objective ass change pain level per NIPS score . The investigator also measure variation heart rate cry time . Any side effect also report . The investigator also measure number successful venipuncture first attempt .</detailed_description>
