	<detailed_description>Limb transplantation surgery , transfer limb ( ) decease human donor patient amputation one limb , experimental reconstructive procedure potential significantly improve life amputee . Limb transplantation similar face transplantation tissue transplant include skin , tendon , muscle , ligament , bone blood vessel . The transplant team Brigham Women 's Hospital include wide variety medical surgical specialty . The team hop build upon success first face transplantation provide amputee patient significant benefit limb transplantation . Toward goal , BWH actively seek qualify candidate limb transplant research study . We study small group people learn : - How advance science limb transplantation - How support limit transplant rejection issue - How people limb transplantation We describe limb transplant surgery life-giving procedure potential dramatically improve , restore , patient 's mental physical health his/her ability function integrate society . However , type organ transplantation , improvement require patient make lifetime commitment take medication suppress body 's immune system . Conventional reconstruction method always consider first , may provide less optimal result certain patient . There many sophisticated prosthesis satisfactorily replace basic function miss limb . However , replace limb ( whole part ) prosthetics remain suboptimal prosthesis provide sensation natural appearance . Limbtransplant surgery , however , potential deliver desire functional aesthetic benefit . Functionally , limb transplant surgery provide patient new limb , extensive rehabilitation , allow him/her perform daily activity , case , return work . Furthermore , ability restore near-normal aesthetic appearance limb ( ) lead tremendous psychological benefit , include elevate confidence mood . From time begin search qualified limb transplant recipient continue care provide follow surgery , significant amount time , expertise attentiveness contribute toward make procedure progressive success . Limb transplant candidate go extensive screening process likely last several month . This screen include psychiatric social support evaluation series imaging test help determine patient 's physical mental readiness procedure . If , upon completion screen process , determine patient suitable candidate , place patient transplant wait list . We begin work New England Organ Bank ( NEOB ) team find donor match recipient 's tissue requirement - example similar age correct blood type . This search could take many month , , suitable donor find within one year , speak patient determine whether he/she willing continue wait .</detailed_description>
