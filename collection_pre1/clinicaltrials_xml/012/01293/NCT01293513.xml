	<brief_summary>Although introduction Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy - HAART - dramatically alter course HIV/AIDS , true cure still unattainable patient require take medication rest life . As well know , prolong use agent associate serious , sometimes life-threatening side effect , metabolic disturbance diabetes increase incidence myocardial infarction . In 1999 , patient acute HIV infection treat soon diagnosis ( `` Berlin patient '' ) . However intercurrent condition , treatment interrupt two occasion . After third introduction therapy , treatment terminate ( arbitrarily ) patient find undetectable virus throughout follow approximately 18 month . The possible explanation phenomenon autovaccination . Other worker try Structured Treatment Interruption ( STI ) Acute/Primary HIV Infection controversial result , possibly cycle treatment interruption . In patient treat center Acute HIV infection , initial HAART therapy , underwent gradually increase interruption treatment 1 7 week . After complete cessation treatment , patient follow 3 year , CD4 level normal , CD4/CD8 ratio remain 1 viral load undetectable . Our plan study patient Acute/Primary HIV Infection , treat HAART least one year . Once show undetectable virus ( le 40 copy HIV RNA per milliliter ) CD4 500 per microliter CD4/CD8 1 , enrol STI study . The study comprise 6 group 4 cycle treatment/interruption increase duration treatment interruption alternate treatment interval 33 month period . Altogether 24 treatment interruption , last 1 week 6 week . During time patient regularly monitor clinical event laboratory parameter . The purpose study determine whether patient acute/primary HIV infection undergo grade STI achieve normal immune status undetectable viral load long-term basis .</brief_summary>
