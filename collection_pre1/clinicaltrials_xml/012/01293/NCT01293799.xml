	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Peritonitis remain significant problem peritoneal dialysis . It lead cause technique failure , contribute mortality . The incidence high first year treatment . Non-compliance Peritoneal Dialysis ( PD ) protocol show important risk factor peritonitis . Reinforcement knowledge ability perform PD therefore appear possible way reduce incidence peritonitis . This study The PEritonitis Prevention Study ( PEPS ) . METHODS : The objective randomized , multi-centre investigation , include 750 new PD patient perform ( PD ) without assistance , evaluate regular retrain reduce incidence peritonitis , technique-failure rate , hospitalisation day due peritonitis compare regular follow-up regimen . Patients intervention group test PD-technique test questionnaire regular interval PD-start every peritonitis episode focus infection prophylaxis . If need , retrain . The control group treat accord routine center . The study ongoing Denmark , Norway , Sweden , Finland , Estonia , Latvia , Netherlands , UK . The study go 6 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND See . AIMS To study regular follow-up PD patient test theoretical practical knowledge ( hereafter call `` new type follow-up '' ) reduce incidence peritonitis , reduce technique failure rate relate peritonitis , reduce time hospitalization relate peritonitis compare routine regimen . For specific aim , see `` Outcome measure '' . PATIENTS AND METHODS The study randomize , multi-centre investigation intend enclose 750 new PD patient Sweden , Denmark , Norway , Finland , Estonia , Latvia , Netherlands , United Kingdom . Inclsuion finish December 31 , 2014 . The study go last included patient take part study one year . The study thus terminate December 31 , 2015 . The study include follow-up group control group . The intervention follow-up group consist regular test theoretical practical knowledge regard PD focus infection prophylaxis include retrain need test goal reach . The control group treat accord routine center . Peritonitis define accord ISPD guideline ( Perit Dial Int 2005 ; 25:107-131 ) The baseline PD training participate centre follow international recommendation . In addition , fluorescent alcohol UV lamp use control result hand disinfection patient initial PD training . Thereafter method use follow-up group . In follow-up group , knowledge basal training test 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month PD start , every sixth month thereafter , every episode peritonitis . Such testing also perform restart PD . The follow-up include two type test : 1 . The patient fill questionnaire theoretical practical question focus infection infection prophylaxis PD treatment . Goal : At least 80 % question correct . If goal reach , train give goal reach . 2 . The patient perform practical test include hand disinfection , PD exchange technique , exit-site care . Hand disinfection skill control help fluorescent alcohol UV lamp . Goal : All step practical test correctly perform . If , train give goal reach .</detailed_description>
