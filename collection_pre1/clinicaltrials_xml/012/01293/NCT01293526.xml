	<brief_title>Acute Optimization Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy ( CRT ) Using Echocardiography SonR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator ( CRT-D ) device design automatically recognize stop rapid , harmful heart beat allow heart return safe , regular heart rhythm . The CRT-D device may help heart pump efficiently improve time different part heart beat . A CRT-D device three lead ( wire go heart ) . One lead place one top chamber heart ( right atrium ) , another lead place low right chamber ( right ventricle ) third lead place along side leave ventricle . The top chamber stimulate first , either natural heartbeat CRT-D device heartbeat slow . Shortly , bottom chamber stimulate . By pace heart way , doctor hope improve time different component heart beat order improve efficiency heart improve patient 's heart failure symptom . The purpose study correlate three lead placement possibility responses patient 's heart . This do help echocardiography SonR signal , external device capable detect sound created heart . Based CRT implant , special measurement make optimize placement device lead . Based success measurement patient 's response , patient place one three group . Group 1 : Patients response Patients successful response randomize : Group 2 : Lead placement base study measurement OR Group 3 : Standard lead placement</detailed_description>
