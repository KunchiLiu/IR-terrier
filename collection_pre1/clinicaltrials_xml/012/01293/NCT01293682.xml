	<brief_summary>This research examine effectiveness calcitriol treat bone loss woman begin treatment breast cancer . Twenty-five ( 25 ) subject expect take part study . The investigator n't know bone loss breast cancer survivor treat differently bone loss woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects High Dose Calcitriol Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The calcitriol intervention aim reduce fracture risk maintain proper bone density . Calcitriol efficacious maintain proper bone health muscle mass among general population , little research do breast cancer patient . In addition , calcitriol may effective reduce tumor proliferation angiogenesis , increase tumor apoptosis . Each factor could beneficial effect breast cancer outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Must female . Must pathologically confirm incident , primary invasive breast cancer . Must await surgical resection . Women childbearing potential ( i.e . woman premenopausal surgically sterile ) must use acceptable contraceptive method ( abstinence , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , double barrier device ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior begin treatment trial . Contraceptive use need continue least 1 month trial end . Must provide informed consent . Must willing discontinue use calcium and/or vitamin D supplement multivitamin supplementation . Participants must ionize serum calcium level within normal limit ( 1.191.29mmol/L ) total correct serum calcium &lt; 10.2mg/dl . Subjects lifethreatening condition would preclude breast cancer treatment include : chronic cardiac failure , unstable despite medication use ; uncontrolled hypertension ; uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ; unstable coronary artery disease . Patients severe metabolic disorder , include phenylketonuria ( PKU ) , homocystinuria , Fabry 's disease , would preclude take calcitriol . Patients previous history cancer except nonmelanomous skin cancer within past 5 year . Patients impaired renal function ( CRCL &lt; 60 mL/min ) kidney stone ( calcium salt ) within past 5 year . Patients hypercalcemia ( correct serum CA &gt; 10.2 mg/dl ) history hypercalcemia vitamin D toxicity . Patients currently take calcium supplement aluminumbased antacid must immediately discontinue use enroll study . Patients currently take vitamin D supplement must immediately discontinue use enroll study . Patients know sensitivity calcitriol . Women pregnant lactating . Women antiresorptive drug ( e.g . bisphosphonates ) within past year . Women currently use oral contraception . Women malabsorptive syndrome ( i.e . cystic fibrosis , chronic pancreatitis ) take medication decrease absorption fat soluble vitamin ( i.e . Orlistat , Questran ) . Participants assign calcitriol routinely take multivitamin supplement may continue supplement long amount vitamin D supplement excess RDA ( recommend daily allowance ) 400 IU 10 Î¼g . If take multivitamin supplement , ask start supplementation study .</criteria>
