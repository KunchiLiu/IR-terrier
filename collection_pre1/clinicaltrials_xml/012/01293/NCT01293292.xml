	<brief_summary>Previously approach treatment osteoporosis use medication prevent excessive resorption bone . More recently medication build new bone , i.e . anabolic treatment , , , develop . The investigator would like develop strategy evaluate effectiveness anabolic therapy study currently available therapy ( teriparatide ) . This strategy could use assess new anabolic treatment develop use human . The aim study 1 ) fully describe change bone turnover response teriparatide biochemical marker type time ; 2 ) fully describe change bone mineral density ( BMD ) response teriparatide site , bone compartment time . If study able identify early response treatment , help speed drug development area , allow identification promise new anabolic drug enable u understand mechanism action . This benefit investigator patient investigator well understand drug work .</brief_summary>
