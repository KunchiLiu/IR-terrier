	<brief_summary>TC-6987 selective nicotinic α-7 receptor ligand ( open channel stabilizer ) demonstrate potent anti-inflammatory/antioxidant property animal model . Following oral administration 1mg/kg dose TC-6987 diabetic mouse ( db/db mouse ) 7 week , numerous metabolic improvement observe . Specifically , plasma glucose triglyceride concentration decline approximately 30 % ; Hb1Ac reduce nearly 50 % ; TNF-α decline 60 % relative control db/db mouse Therefore , appear TC-6987 could prove beneficial reducing elevate glucose concentration diabetic patient well ameliorate organ damage associate inflammation , oxidative stress hyperglycemia .</brief_summary>
