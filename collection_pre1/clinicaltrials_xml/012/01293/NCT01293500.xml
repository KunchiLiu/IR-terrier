	<brief_summary>Recent advance critical care medicine dramatically improve morbidity mortality critical illness . Goal-directed therapy protocol instrumental change . Goal-directed therapy standardize rapid delivery definitive care illnesses SIRS ( Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ) head trauma . Although treatment approach show improve clinical outcome , widely adopt outside academic medical center . Further improvement outcomes critical illness likely goal-directed therapy utilize early course care . To facilitate early adoption , goal-directed therapeutic protocol develop implement specialized pediatric transport team . The investigator hypothesize institution goal-directed therapy pediatric interfacility transport improve outcome critically ill child . The GRIPIT Trial ( Goal-directed Resuscitative Interventions Pediatric Inter-facility Transport ) compare outcome pediatric SIRS patient implementation goal-directed therapeutic protocol transport . This first test goal-directed therapy transport environment . Data collect pediatric SIRS patient transport Angel One Transport Team Arkansas Children 's Hospital protocol implementation . Outcome measure include length hospital stay , length intensive care unit ( ICU ) stay , incidence multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) , require therapeutic intervention ICU stay ( TISS-28 score ) . In addition , NIRS ( Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ) monitoring use cerebral somatic oxygenation trend monitor , determine effectiveness resuscitation guide pediatric SIRS transport . NIRS trend useful surrogate marker systemic venous saturation , know decrease severe SIRS .</brief_summary>
