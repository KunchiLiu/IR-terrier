	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot clinical trial study whether Oncotype DX gene expression `` Recurrence Score '' ( RS ) would useful help make decision type pre-operative treatment , hormone therapy chemotherapy would better patient hormone responsive cancer suitable breast conserving surgery . The RS currently use predict risk distant recurrence benefit addition chemotherapy hormonal therapy adjuvant setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hormone Therapy Or Chemotherapy Before Surgery Based Gene Expression Analysis Treating Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Assessed feasibility carry large-scale multi-center trial recurrence score ( RS ) use select treatment type neoadjuvant setting . Whether patient intermediate RS willing randomize hormonal chemotherapy . The treatment receive experimental consider standard treatment type cancer participant . What experimental include way assign type treatment . The design study use help determine RS use predict type treatment woman breast cancer likely benefit . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 3 group base RS follow Oncotype Dx gene expression profile . - GROUP 1 ( RS &lt; 11 ) : Patients receive neoadjuvant hormonal therapy comprise tamoxifen ( pre-menopausal woman ) aromatase inhibitor ( post-menopausal woman ) 4-6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - GROUP 2 ( RS 11-25 ) : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm : - ARM 1 : Patients receive neoadjuvant hormonal therapy group I . - ARM 2 : Patients receive 6-8 course neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprise anthracycline/taxane base regimen 4-6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - GROUP 3 ( RS &gt; 25 ) : Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy group 2 arm 2 . All patient undergo surgery receive hormonal therapy least 5 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
