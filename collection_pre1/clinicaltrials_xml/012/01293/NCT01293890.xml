	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) represent one challenging chronic diseases 21st century : expect fourth lead cause death 2030 . COPD characterize pulmonary extra-pulmonary systemic manifestation cause partly irreversible expiratory airflow obstruction . The cornerstone COPD management prescription single combine inhalation therapy , short- long-acting bronchodilator , inhaled corticosteroid possibly prevent disease progression , preserve lung function , relieve respiratory symptom prevent treat exacerbation . Given complex lifelong treatment , one expect adherence prescribe inhalation therapy self-evident . Adherence define `` extent person 's behaviour ( take medication , follow recommend diet and/or execute life-style change ) corresponds agree recommendation health care provider '' . Inhaled medication additional complexity patient intend adherent may take inhaled medication incorrectly , prohibit proper therapeutic action . Taking less prescribed amount medication , miss dos stop treatment brief extend period put patient risk suboptimal disease control . Hence , effectiveness largely depend patient 's ability manage disease adequately daily life . Using electronic monitoring , 3 study COPD find prevalence medication non-adherence 51 % bad average prevalence 29 % ( range 3-66 % ) find across disease hypertension , cancer , epilepsia , infection HIV . The exist evidence risk factor nonadherence COPD mostly anecdotic guide behavioral model . According integrated model behavioral prediction ( IMBP ) , barrier , skill ability intention important driver adherence ( i.e . medication adherence ) . The aim study follow : - To prospectively investigate impact medication nonadherence time exacerbation ( primary end-point ) exacerbation rate , FEV1 , hospitalization rate duration , quality life ( secondary end-points ) 1 year follow-up use electronic monitoring - To investigate risk factor medication nonadherence , use Integrated Model Behavioral Prediction theoretical framework - To determine diagnostic accuracy different measure medication nonadherence ( i.e . pill count , self-report physician rating ) relative electronic monitoring . - To investigate prevalence nonadherence aspect therapeutic regimen , i.e . use concomitant medication , smoke cessation , alcohol use , physical activity , attendance rehabilitation session dietary adherence , interrelation , impact ( alone combination ) time first exacerbation . - To investigate interrelation adherence various component therapeutic regimen . - To investigate impact nonadherence component therapeutic regimen ( alone combination ) clinical outcome ( i.e . time exacerbation , exacerbation rate/PPY , FEV1 , hospitalization rate duration , quality life 1 year follow-up .</brief_summary>
