	<detailed_description>Phase III clinical trial systematic sampling , double-blind , randomize , cross evaluates comparative efficacy formulation contain enzyme pancreas 16 patient pancreatic insufficiency exogenous cause . The study conduct inclusion 16 adult patient , sex , regardless color social class , age 14 65 year , clinically diagnose pancreatic insufficiency exocrine etiology ( cystic fibrosis , cancer , pancreatectomy , Surgery trauma ) . The Research Subjects recruit help medical coinvestigador specialist Dr. Francisco Callejas Neto , offer clinic patient participate study . If interest , invite attend Clinic total LAL clarification study drug action , benefit , possible risk , compensation , study period , finally understand read sign together investigator Term Consent . The research subject complete freedom lead Informed Consent house , review item easy . After informed consent form sign inform , patient examine researcher LAL Clinic perform physical examination general specific . Will rat personal background review Inclusion Excluded study . Satisfying criterion inclusion study subject approve participate study . The 16 Subjects Research approve within inclusion criterion exclusion participate study include study sequential number care . Later , insert randomization table , outline randomize crossover two drug , randomization scheme balance cross 2 x 2 . A design say balanced satisfies follow condition : · Each medication apply subject ; • period , number subject receive medicine must equal ; This randomization previously perform computer program qualify professional Prof. Dr. Yuko Wada Cilicia ( PhD Biostatistics PhD Biostatistics , UNICAMP ) Statpharm Scientific Consulting Ltda . All study medication label accord randomization , previously perform pharmacy LAL Clinica , make conference material 3 check . In period study medication label following word : code subject study period dose administer . All procedure make minimize avoid bias study .</detailed_description>
