	<detailed_description>The study cohort study use outpatient Parkinson 's Disease Hoen Yahr Stage 2.5 - 3 . Participants pre- post-exercise testing , well participate 8-week balance-training program . Subjects Subjects recruited outpatient clinic ( physician , therapy ) Rehabilitation Institute Chicago ( RIC ) well Northwestern Movement Disorders Clinic , Department Neurology . Approximately 20 subject screen inclusion institution 12 subject enrol study . ( see Power analysis ) . Recruitment Procedures Potential subject approach treat outpatient physician ( Physiatrist Neurologist ) Physical Occupational Therapist see would interest participate study . The principal investigator also send introductory letter outpatient RIC inform study . Letters send PI 's patient ( Dr. Marciniak , Dr. Toledo ) . Potential subject educate regard study procedure , risk benefit , privacy risk . Informed consent obtain initial screening sign patient interested proceeding . Eligibility criterion screen ( See ) . Subjects lack decisional capacity include study . Study Procedures This study involve initial visit ( Visit 1 ) screen baseline data collection . The therapy/intervention session hold 3 time per week 8 week , ( Visits 2 - 25 ) , 1 post-intervention visit data collection ( Visit 26 ) . Subjects reimburse 11 dollar park expense mail weekly form check . All visit take place Abbott Hall , 3rd floor exercise room visit take approximately 1 Â½ hr . Visit 1 Following consent , follow baseline measure perform : 1 . Physician screen medical history ( include fall month prior visit ) physical examination 2 . Mini Mental Status Examination ( MMSE ) 3 . Hoehn Yahr Staging 4 . Questionnaires : 1 . Activities-Specific Balance Scale 2 . Parkinson 's Disease Quality Life measure ( PDQ-8 c. Geriatric Depression Scale . 5 . Berg Balance Scale , perform trained physical therapist 6 . Dynamic Gait Index , perform physical therapist 7 . Gait mobility subscales UPDRS 8 . Sharpened Romberg eye open close 9 . Balance also measure use Wii balance board . Subjects stand board gait belt place around waist . Subjects accelerometer ( do via smart phone ) clip waist measure sway , stand Wii board , subject 's ability perform reach task assess , measure postural sway . The investigator remain immediately next subject testing procedure safety purpose gait belt place , balance bar also next patient test procedure . Visits 2- 25 ( 3x/ week 8 week ) ( Within 2 week initial test ) The subject see Wirtz Sports Center exercise room . They participate 3 Wii balance board game : marble game , ski game , bubble game . Each subject stand balance board participate 3 game 10 minute per game 10 minute rest game , total 30 minute balance training time per session . Subjects gait belt place exercise , supervise physical therapist research assistant . Either Physical therapist Research Assistant always immediately next subject train program . A balance bar also next subject need balance . Weekly , subject ask change medication fall may experience home community . Visit 26 Subjects see follow assessment within 2 week final training session follow test repeat : 1 . Interval history ( include fall ) , exam , Hoehn Yahr Staging 2 . Questionnaires : 1 .
