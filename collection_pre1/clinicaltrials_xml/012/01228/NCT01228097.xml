	<brief_summary>This study compare brain hormone responses food image ( food ) woman undergo : ( 1 ) gastric bypass surgery ; ( 2 ) principally restrictive surgery ( laparoscopic adjustable gastric band laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ) ; ( 3 ) weight loss surgery , intent remain relatively weight stable ( within 10-15 lb present weight ) . The investigator use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) see brain responds picture food consume liquid meal replacement . The investigator wish determine whether two surgery different effect appetite , observable brain , whether possible effect appetite differ participant similar body weight remain relatively weight stable . The investigator also draw blood determine `` hunger '' `` fullness '' hormone change eat see difference among three group . The study sponsor National Institutes Health ( NIH ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neural Response Eating Weight Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize RYGB-treated patient exhibit great reduction ( baseline ) BOLD response area associate homeostatic hedonic eat LAGB/LSG control patient . We also expect LAGB/LSG patient ( result hormonal change occur weight loss ) display great increase BOLD response image highly palatable food extremely obese control . We expect RYGB-treated patient show large increase ( relative baseline ) postprandial GLP-1 PYY3-36 LAGB/LSG obese control group . We also compare change ghrelin three group . We predict patient undergo RYGB great reduction ghrelin control subject . We expect RYGB-treated patient demonstrate great postprandial change ( relative baseline ) brain activity homeostatic hedonic feed area ( suggest normalization satiety neural processing food reward ) patient undergo LAGB/LSG seek weight loss .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Women Over 18 year old BMI 40 kg/ m2 ( 35 kg/m2 presence significant weightrelated comorbidities , include establish coronary artery disease , establish peripheral arterial disease , symptomatic carotid artery disease , sleep apnea , metabolic syndrome , cardiomyopathy , hypertension , debilitate joint pain ) . Nonsurgical group must willing remain weight stable seek weight loss ( i.e. , define remain within 5 % baseline weight ) . Weight &gt; 350 pound maximum weight accommodate scanner ) ; supine abdominal width ( arm fold ) &gt; 60 cm sagittal diameter &gt; 50 cm ( i.e. , maximum dimension accommodate scanner ) Pregnancy lactation Type 1 type 2 diabetes Severe major depression psychiatric disorder significantly interfere daily live Substance use disorder ( current remission 1 year ) Current use nicotine illicit drug Presence history orthopedic circumstance , metallic insert , pacemaker , claustrophobia , condition may interfere magnetic resonance imaging Use weight loss medication agent know affect body weight blood glucose ( e.g. , glucocorticoid , secondgeneration antipsychotic medication ) Lack capacity provide inform consent Nonsurgical participant interested lose weight next 2 year Plans relocate area within 2 year Principal Investigator discretion</criteria>
