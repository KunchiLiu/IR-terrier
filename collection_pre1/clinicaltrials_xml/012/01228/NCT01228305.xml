	<brief_title>Acetaminophen Oxidative Stress After Cardiopulmonary Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infants complex congenital cardiac defect frequently undergo cardiopulmonary bypass ( CBP ) surgical repair cardiac lesion ( 1 ) . CBP expose infant child endothelial damage , hyperoxia , hemolysis , systemic inflammatory response ( 2-7 ) . The systemic inflammatory response contribute organ dysfunction initiate exposure blood artificial surface extracorporeal circuit result significant hemolysis activation complement . Hyperoxia show cause oxidative stress production free radical molecule , contributes morbidity CPB . Hemolysis lead free hemoglobin subsequent release free iron plasma , catalyze redox reaction show another source severe oxidant injury child follow bypass ( 8 , 9 ) . Additionally , release proinflammatory cytokine , hypothermia , hemorrhage require multiple transfusion , activation neutrophil lead enhancement respiratory burst contribute oxidative injury worsen inflammation ( 9 ) . Myoglobin hemoglobin contain ferrous iron ( Fe2+ ) , normally transport reversibly bind oxygen molecule tissue . When muscle red blood cell damage , iron-chelating heme molecule release plasma , ferrous iron oxidize ferric ( Fe3+ ) state . In high oxidation state , ferric hemoprotein able reduce molecule , notably hydrogen peroxide lipid hydroperoxides , produce lipid peroxide ferryl ( Fe4+ ) hemoproteins . The ferryl hemoproteins enter oxidation-reduction cycle lipid molecule , cause lipid peroxide production , lead cascade oxidative damage cellular membrane ( 10-12 ) . With increase oxidative stress , oxygen free radical attack esterified arachidonate layer within cell membrane lipid bilayers , result production multiple lipid peroxidation product call isoprostanes ( Iso-P ) isofurans ( IsoF ) ( 13-17 ) . Many form IsoF IsoP show powerful vasoconstrictor , show contribute pathogenesis organ dysfunction associate rhabdomyolysis , subarachnoid hemorrhage hemolytic disorder ( 10 , 16 , 18-21 ) . F2-isoprostanes sensitive specific marker oxidative stress vivo . ( 4 ) The mechanism/s causing increase oxidative stress CPB incompletely understand relationship free hemoglobin F2-isoprostanes human undergo CPB unknown . Inhibition hemoprotein-induced oxidative stress may important clinical application human . Hemolysis , addition contribute oxidative stress response , also associate acute kidney injury ( AKI ) patient undergo CPB extracorporeal life support ( 5-6 ) . In fact , plasma free hemoglobin show independent predictor AKI early postoperative period ( 5 ) . We recently demonstrate acetaminophen , inhibition prostaglandin H2-synthases ( PGHS ) , inhibit oxidation free arachidonic acid catalyze myoglobin hemoglobin . Moreover , animal model rhabdomyolysis-induced kidney injury , acetaminophen significantly attenuate decrease creatinine clearance compare control ( 10 ) . The current proposal test central hypothesis acetaminophen attenuate oxidative stress response associate CPB-induced hemolysis child undergo cardiac surgery . If acetaminophen attenuates oxidative stress response associate CPB-induced hemolysis potential therapeutic benefit extends cardiac surgery patient require CPB . Based outcome pilot study design prospective randomize trial test hypothesis acetaminophen reduce AKI associate hemoprotein-induced oxidative stress follow CPB .</detailed_description>
