	<brief_title>The Efficacy Health Navigation® Cancer-Related Fatigue Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>*** Background Cancer-related fatigue ( CRF ) impact patient ' quality life increase subject research . Especially , cancer survivor complain fatigue ( moderate - severe ) care . Multidimensional characteristic CRF address NCCN guideline CRF , NCCN guideline point importance behavioral approach manage CRF . NCCN guideline 2008 suggest 6 strategic area ( 1 ) Energy Conservation , 2 ) Pain 3 ) Sleep disturbance 4 ) Distress 5 ) exercise , 6 ) Nutrition ) important issue care CRF addition medical treatment care chronic disease co morbidity . Behavioral strategy lead 6 area effective . However , knowledge , study examine comprehensive fatigue management program . The objective study develop Web base , tailor program ( Health Navigation® ) disease-free cancer patient cope CRF , evaluate efficacy Web-based program ( Health Navigation® ) . From evidence extract literature review , content program elaborate , tailor TTM model . The curriculum currently review validate expert group palliative care physician , oncologist , nurse , psychologist health education scientist . The module pretested small number patient , discuss term feasibility acceptance . *** Method To determine efficacy program ( Health Navigation® ) , randomize control trial conduct : After exclude patient cause ( anemia , thyroid disease , liver disease , co morbidity etc ) , 296 patient recruit base statistical assumption alpha ( 0.05 ) , beta ( 0.20=power 80 % ) , effect size ( 0.375 ) drop rate ( 10 % ) . First , stratify accord age ( &lt; 50 vs. &gt; 50 ) sex ( male vs. female ) , cancer type ( type 1 : stomach cancer &amp; colon cancer , type 2 : Cervix &amp; Breast cancer &amp; Thyroid , type 3 : Lung cancer ) , cancer stage ( I-III ) ; allocate intervention wait-list control group . When intervention group participate Web-based care program ( Health Navigation® ) , receive various information relate CRF . And Web-based fatigue care program consist 6 strategic area ( energy conservation , nutrition , exercise , sleep disturbance , pain , distress ) ; three area ( pain , exercise , sleep disturbance ) base transtheoretical model ( TTM ) , others ( energy conservation , distress , nutrition ) base psycho-education method cognitive behavioral therapy . Cancer survivor participate Web-based care program ( Health Navigation® ) receive tailored EMS/SMS message notify participant next program 's news last program 's issue etc . Their assistant ( family member friend ) help change behavior . Wait-list ( control ) group could participate fatigue-care program ( base Web base care program : Health Navigation® ) . They could treat usual care use internet health information . However , participate fatigue care program ( Health Navigation® ) 12 week . Data collect randomization , intervention , follow-up 6 month .</detailed_description>
