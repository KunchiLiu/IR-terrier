	<brief_title>Sulforaphane Treating Patients With Recurrent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine proportion patient achieve 50 % decline prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level within 20 week sulforaphane treatment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine percentage change PSA baseline final measure value end study well maximal PSA decline occur study subject . II . To determine proportion patient whose PSA double full 20 week sulforaphane treatment . III . To determine safety profile sulforaphane . IV . To determine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) sulforaphane metabolite blood . V. To determine effect sulforaphane supplementation target pharmacodynamic ( PD ) modulation peripheral blood cell . VI . To assess effect Glutathione-S-Transferase Mu 1 ( GSTM1 ) genotype sulforaphane PK , PD . VII . To collect frozen serum future analysis correlative biomarkers . OUTLINE : Patients receive sulforaphane orally ( PO ) daily 20 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 14-30 day every 6 month 12 month .</detailed_description>
