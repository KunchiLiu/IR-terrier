	<brief_summary>Performing adduction abduction resistance exercise increase hip bone density strength great extent squat deadlift exercise . Aim # 1 : To determine hip adduction abduction resistance exercise train 16 week improve spine bone mineral density hip bone mineral density strength determine finite element modeling . Aim # 2 : To compare effect hip adduction abduction exercise squat deadlift exercise respect potential change hip bone mineral density strength . Aim # 3 : To determine addition adduction abduction exercise squat deadlift exercise promote `` additive '' effect respect change spine bone mineral density hip bone mineral density bone strength .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect 16 Weeks Hip Adduction Abduction Resistance Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator carry 16-week exercise training study ( n=24 ) consist 3 group ( n=8 per group ) healthy , non-resistance trained adult men woman ( age 25-55 year ) . Our aim determine hip adduction abduction resistance exercise effective squat deadlift exercise respect change whole bone strength density proximal femur spine . Group A hip adduction abduction exercise . Group B squat deadlift exercise Group C combination hip adduction abduction squat deadlift exercise Subjects image quantitative compute tomography ( QCT ) proximal femur spine , pre-training post-training , determine change spinal bone density proximal femoral bone density strength . Serum assay bone formation ( osteocalcin ) bone resorption ( serum CTX type I ) perform four time study 4 week interval .</detailed_description>
