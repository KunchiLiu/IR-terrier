	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral therapy , gradually become standard care develop country , confers enormous benefit yet substantial morbidity remain human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive population . Multivitamin supplement immune-enhancing effect , supplement find improve immunologic status reduce morbidity mortality among HIV-positive Tanzanian woman pre-highly active anti-retroviral therapy ( HAART ) stag disease . These supplement think require restore adequate nutrient level context HIV infection . This study enroll 400 men woman Kampala district Uganda , receive recently initiate HAART . At baseline monthly thereafter , research physician nurse study clinic assess participant 's clinical status undertake study procedure . Each participant follow 18 month , his/her death loss follow-up . Home visit conduct participant miss schedule clinic appointment . We perform nutritional assessment ( anthropometry dietary intake ) enrollment several follow-up point , laboratory measurement ( CD4 cell count complete blood count ) every six month . Importantly , study participant continue receive standard care accord national guideline entire study period . Multivitamins could low-cost , adjunct therapy help alleviate disease burden elevate quality life HIV-infected individual HAART . At time , efficacy could help preserve limited drug regimen develop setting postpone need switch second line regimen HAART . Our proposal represent collaboration Harvard School Public Health , Infectious Disease Institute Makerere University School Public Health Kampala , Uganda .</detailed_description>
