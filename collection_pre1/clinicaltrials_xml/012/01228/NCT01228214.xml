	<detailed_description>Treatment Cardiovascular Diseases ( CVD ) major health care problem across entire word , particularly United States . In fact , life-threatening disorder major cause emergency medical care hospitalization United States , accord National Center Health Statistics ( NCHS ) approximately 1,565,000 hospitalization primary secondary diagnosis acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) , 669,000 unstable angina ( UA ) 896,000 myocardial infarction ( MI ) . In 2003 , NCHS report 4,497,000 visit emergency department primary diagnosis CVD , wherein average age person first heart attack calculate 65.8 year men 70.4 year woman . Further study provide Heart Disease Stroke Statistics—2007 Update , American Heart Association , report estimate 79 400 000 American adult ( 1 3 ) 1 type CVD . Of , 37 500 000 estimate age 65 old . As separate diagnosis , high blood pressure hypertension , account approximately 72 000 000 patient ( define systolic pressure 140 mm Hg great and/or diastolic pressure 90 mm Hg great , take antihypertensive medication ) , coronary heart disease ( CHD ) approximately 15 800 000 patient , myocardial infarction approximately 7 900 000 patient , angina pectoris ( chest pain secondary ischemic heart disease ) approximately 8 900 000 patient . Although treatment angina ( chest pain secondary ischemic heart disease one common early symptom coronary artery disease ) track far 1880 's , still represent medically unresolved problem . Indeed , treatment angina particular , well associate condition ACS , UA , MI , involve large number life-style change recommendation , dietetic advice , drug , coronary artery intervention , coronary bypass surgery aim improve symptom , quality life patient , even primary secondary prevention CVD . Unfortunately , despite century medical advance epidemiological study , current approach CVD , coronary artery disease remain complex , time frustrate . Among proposal combat CVD , include single `` polypill '' ( aspirin + statin + 3 blood pressure lower agent half dose , folic acid ) strategy reduce CVD 80 % remain presently unresolved , regression coronary atherosclerosis use Simvastatin intravascular ultrasound study determine unpractical . It remain determined whether change translate meaningful reduction clinical event , whether new antithrombotic agent CVD patient provide adequate solution . However , overarch determination view purport success date remain whether result highly select patient population match real-world treatment acute coronary syndrome . In recent study call COURAGE Trial ( Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization Aggressive Drug Evaluation ) conduct 50 hospital center across United States Canada show optimal drug treatment percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) stable coronary artery disease , effective optimal medical therapy alone prevent cardiovascular event , hospitalization death , suggest drug , surgical procedure statistically effective solution CHD . For century , hemodynamic mechanism involve couple tissue O2/CO2 gas exchange ion H/K transport Hemoglobin ( Hb ) red blood cell ( RBC ) well know scientific community , term so-called Bohr/Haldane Effect . Data date show RBC number critical role maintain normal vascular function , blood flow , tissue oxygenation acid-base regulation . These critical role , include nitric oxygen ( NO ) transport , NO synthetase expression , platelet aggregation , vascular rheology , endothelial function , subject extensive study many investigator . Unfortunately , despite multiple integrated function maintain tissue oxygenation health disease state , role RBC never interest therapeutic approach patient CHD , specially ischemic condition ACS , UA MI . In context , evidence laboratory erythrocytes critical role body K homeostasis , along find hereditable defect erythrocyte K uptake hypertensive , 46 % normotensive ( adolescent , young adult ) offspring , lead u ass whether defective K uptake could impair regulation H/K exchange oxygen delivery CAD . Since , Patent Application whose file USPTO , simple medical device intracellular K measurement red blood cell miniature K Na ion-selective electrode propose conjunction University Michigan . Although many drug test order improve correct defective red cell K transport , promise compound 3,5-diamino-6-chloro-N- [ diaminomethylene ] pyrazinecarboxamide dihydrate derivative , amiloride hydrochloride recently publish new drug patent application . The drug originally test hypertensive low RBC K uptake , independently cell Na content , dietary intake drug , become effective predictable method improve RBC K homeostasis critically relate red-cell function , pH regulation oxygen delivery . More important , observation reversal abnormal RBC K content associate decline good control BP , fast plasma glucose , regression ST-T alteration relate LVH CHD , lead u evaluate role RBC mechanism H/K exchange , tissue oxygenation health disease state . This Clinical Trial address effect Amiloride RBC K uptake , consequently simultaneous tissue H/K O2/CO2 exchange , therapeutic effect BP control possible improvement Angina , Duke Treadmill Score , ST-T alteration LVH CAD . METHODS OF TREATMENT Each patient prospectively evaluate order ass effect Amiloride reversion angina ECG alteration ischemia CAD . After write consent , subject enter Double-Blind trial Amiloride Vs Placebo along whit optimal treatment Angina CHD . Amiloride ( 5 10 mg ) give daily , breakfast , medication angina , associate disease hypertension diabetes , continue . Each patient clinically evaluate angina , dyspnea , arrhythmias 1-week , 1 , 3 , 6 month period . Serial ECG , Ion Transport Studies , BIA , non-invasive hemodynamic clinical biochemistry obtain 1 , 3 , 6 month follow-up period . Echocardiograms obtain basal 6- month period . In trial , subject plasma ionize calcium ( ≤1.0 mmol/l ) receive 1g Ca- gluconolactate level ≥1.0 mmol/l . Following first 3-month trial , patient reversion angina improvement ECG abnormalities ischemia low dos amiloride ( 5 7.5 mg ) , nitrate , B-blockers Calcium Channel Blockers progressively discontinue , evidence angina occur , new ECG ST-T alteration ischemia develop . Therefore , amiloride with/without aspirin , Statins medication hypertension diabetes , establish treatment end trial .</detailed_description>
