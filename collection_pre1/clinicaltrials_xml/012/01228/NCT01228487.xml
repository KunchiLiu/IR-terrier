	<brief_summary>The important role mechanical joint stress insert progress osteoarthritis ( OA ) support recent study . The degeneration joint cartilage cause either unphysiological load healthy joint physiological load damage joint . The exact mechanisms lead increased weight bearing overuse cartilage degeneration mostly unknown . The hypothesis study parameter oxidative stress joint synovial space reflect damage possibly lead OA . These parameter correlate parameter oxidative stress peripheral blood . Aim study identification non- invasive obtainable biomarkers represent degenerative regenerative change joint .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients clinically manifest OA typically consult physician time irreversible cartilage destruction . This due long time clinically silent progress disease . A biomarker screen profile joint damage valuable tool detection use joint damaging condition especially competitive sport . This would provide method OA risk assessment patient clinical symptom occur . For first step identification biological substance reflect pathologic change joint . Since preterm chondrocyte senescence , apoptosis age related change key factor OA pathophysiology factor closely related oxidative dysbalance measurement factor correlation amount joint damage promising .</detailed_description>
