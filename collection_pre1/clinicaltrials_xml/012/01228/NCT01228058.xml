	<brief_title>A Prospective Evaluation Thromboelastography Identifying Coagulopathy Severely Injured Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol base fact approximately 30 % severely injured military civilian patient disturbance coagulation immediately upon arrival trauma center traditional coagulation test . It hypothesize : 1. coagulopathy patient may detect rapidly RapidTEG traditional coagulation testing ( prothrombin time , PT ; international normalized ratio , INR ; activate partial thromboplastin time , aPTT ) . 2. disturbance different RapidTEG parameter correlate early blood product utilization . 3. RapidTEG parameter correlate closely patient outcome . 4. Rapid TEG able describe change occur coagulation time patient different injury mechanism severities This group recently complete enrollment PRospective , Observational , Multi-center Massive Transfusion sTudy ( PROMMTT ) evaluate process , decision-making , outcomes associate MT . This trial support ten million dollar grant U.S. Department Defense Center Translational Injury Research ( CeTIR ) investigator conduct multi-site observational study severely injured trauma patient require blood transfusion . Through effort , hope determine best method identify patient benefit receive different ratio red blood cell plasma platelet . This study also design evaluate exist MT protocol ten lead trauma center identify protocol associate well survival . Results study use develop future randomize clinical trial test protocol . Building author prove experience ( 1 ) predictive score method predict massive transfusion , ( 2 ) creation maturation massive transfusion protocol , ( 3 ) design large , multi-institutional study , PROMMTT investigator conduct prospective cohort study severely injured patient ( major trauma activation ) arrive three ACS-verified academic Level 1 Trauma Centers , follow 3 aim address : 1 . To determine prevalence severity immediate disturbance coagulation RapidTEG conventional coagulation parameter among major trauma activation . 2 . To determine specific abnormality RapidTEG correlate specific early blood product utilization . 3 . To determine RapidTEG abnormality , compare kaolin-activated TEG , PT , INR aPTT , correlate patient outcome severely injured patient . 4 . To determine temporal relationship RapidTEG parameter anatomic injury , mechanism injury , severity injury . TEG propose superior tool rapidly diagnose help guide resuscitation blood product preclinical data suggest TEG sensitive specific PT PTT coagulation abnormality . Based preclinical work lead Dr Holcomb , feel Rapid TEG help identify coagulopathic patient earlier , allow rapid MT protocol activation , assist develop data driven blood product transfusion guideline . While TEG machine new , widespread thoughtful implementation trauma arena occur . There transfusion algorithm construct large number patient , admission TEG PT/PTT value , transfusion amount patient outcomes . We feel logical step-by-step program first construct data driven algorithm , validates algorithm safe pathway follow . We plan perform RapidTEG upon admission , 3-hours post-admission , 6-hours post-admission , 12-hours post-admission , 24-hours post-admission , daily 4 additional day . Blood sample ( 2 mL non-citrated fresh whole blood ) obtain addition standard blood sample major trauma patient . RapidTEG perform use Thrombelastograph 5000 ( Hemoscope Corporation , Niles , IL ) . Coagulation activate tissue factor . Standard parameter obtain use Hemoscope software : TEG-ACT , r-time , K-time , alpha angle , maximum amplitude ( mA ) , LY30 . In addition RapidTEG , plan perform conventional kaolin-activated TEG , prothrombin time ( PT ) , international normalize ratio ( INR ) , activate thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) , platelet count use standard method . The time obtain blood sample time result make available also record parameter test . For RapidTEG , include final result test well times TEG-ACT , alpha angle , MA become available graphical display .</detailed_description>
