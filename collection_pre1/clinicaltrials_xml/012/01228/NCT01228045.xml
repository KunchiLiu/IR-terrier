	<brief_title>A Study Trastuzumab Combination With TS-ONE &amp; Cisplatin First-line Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -Positive Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric carcinoma second common cause cancer death world-wide . Approximately 875,000 patient diagnose world-wide gastric cancer year . Gastric cancer often diagnose advanced stage1 . At diagnosis , patient gastric carcinoma extends within loco-regional confines undergo curative resection , many patient undergo curative resection . Gastric cancer continue pose major medical challenge . While advanced gastric carcinoma incurable , chemotherapy palliative effect symptomatic patient . Chemotherapy improve outcome compare best supportive care gastric cancer . Various chemotherapeutic agent include 5-FU , mitomycin , etoposide , cisplatin , irinotecan taxanes , demonstrate activity monotherapy . Combination chemotherapy show well survival outcome single agent chemotherapy Standard chemotherapy advance gastric carcinoma include fluoropyrimidine platinum -based combination chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
