	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Health system manage people chronic disease life-expectancy increase treatment option improve . As need resource increase , vital target strategy health care grow group develop offer professional efficient treatment resource use equitable . A proactive strategy secure acute need patient , need whole population serve . AIM : To describe process implementation effect Central Denmark Region 's chronic disease management programme COPD-patients . METHOD : This intervention study , approximately 3000 COPD-patients cluster-randomized bloc-randomization GP-practice . 15 GP-practices Ringkøbing-Skjern Municipality randomize receive focus implementation `` usual '' group . Approximately 4000 COPD patient neighbor municipality similar profile control group without active implementation GP-practice contamination GP-practices therefore eliminate . THE INTERVENTION : A proactive implementation strategy chronic disease management programme design base literature method proven effective implement new way work different stakeholder culture involve . Core intervention element : GP-practice visit education focus registration smoking status offer smoke cessation , stratification COPD patient accord health level disease status , write referral GP community initiative write feedback GP , discharge notice GP hospital , home visit GP practice nurse together community nurse plan care newly discharge frail patient , With data register questionnaire-survey effect COPD-patients self report health , evaluation health system change distribution health resource analyze . How health professional hospital , community-care GP-practices perceive implementation influence conception , interaction culture illustrate interview-survey stakeholder .</detailed_description>
