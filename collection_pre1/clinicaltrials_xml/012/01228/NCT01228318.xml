	<brief_summary>With increase age people live HIV/AIDS , age-induced osteoporosis likely compound HIV/AIDS HAART-associated bone loss . Mechanistically , osteoclasts cell responsible bone resorption form influence key osteoclastogenic cytokine Receptor- Activator NF-KB ( RANKL ) . The osteoclastogenic proresorptive activity RANKL moderate physiological decoy receptor osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) . Imbalance ratio RANKL OPG alters osteoclastic bone resorption lead osteoporosis . Activated T- B-cells major source RANKL , normal physiological B-cells major source OPG . T-cells regulate production OPG B-cells . Thus change immune system induced HIV/AIDS and/or HAART could affect B-cell T-cells RANKL OPG production . Indeed , data group show animal model HIV/AIDS , HIV-1 Transgenic rat , development osteoporosis recapitulate observed HIV-infected patient , B-cell OPG RANKL production concurrently regulate upregulated respectively . Furthermore , preliminary data HIV-infected subject suggest dramatic acute upswing bone resorption follow HAART initiation peak 12 week decline . Based finding , investigator hypothesize HAART associate bone loss drive immune reconstitution . Because effect HAART dramatic magnitude short duration , investigator propose apply antiresorptive agent ( zoledronic acid , reclast® ) specifically spare patient dramatic acute bone damage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In prospective , blind placebo-controlled randomized trial , treatment naïve HIV-infected subject initiate HAART assign HAART + zoledronic acid HAART + placebo . Serial assessment serum level bone marker , cellular expression OPG/RANKL cytokine , cellular immune activation marker , serum bone regulating hormone , bone mineral density ( BMD ) DXA scan undertaken pre-defined time point baseline week 144 HAART . In primary analysis , change serum CTx level , BMD , cellular OPG/RANKL expression baseline week 24 quantitated subsequently compare treatment arm . In addition , impact zoledronic acid administration covariates assess various study time point . The relationship OPG/RANKL expression , immune activation , serum bone regulate hormonal level , bone turnover evaluate .</detailed_description>
