	<brief_title>Non-invasive Ocular Surface Measurements Before After Interventions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most study set environmental condition ( temperature , humidity , airflow ) mimic typical office home environment ( 68 72F 20 50 % ) . For condition change study , chamber operate 65 85F 25 % 80 % RH air flow turn set maximum 3-4 m/s . For type study subject acclimate set environmental condition ( approximately 20 minute ) take set measurement . Then change condition ( rate change 3F/hour 3 % RH/hour ) , subject acclimate condition ( later day another day ) take another set measurement . The expected study length approximately two hour single visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Individuals dry eye diagnosis ( aqueous deficient dry eye [ ADDE ] , and/or evaporative dry eye ) , dry eye symptom ( associated Sjogren 's Syndrome diagnosis ) , refractive surgery , contact lens use , exposure dry work environment appropriate correlate clinical test , subjective response objective measurement current ocular surface status study clinicallyrecommended patientdirected dry eye treatment take dietary supplement , wear moistureretaining goggles , perform lid massage , use counter eye drop artificial tear . Individuals currently dry eye symptom may risk dry eye diagnosis , dry eye symptom clinical dry eye diagnosis , interest correlate clinical test , subjective response objective measurement current ocular surface status , symptom appear worsen , correlate data effect environmental condition change , increase humidity reduce air flow , ocular surface . Individuals undergone ocular surgery increase risk dry eye . While subject ocular surgery may never develop dry eye symptom adequate reserve tear production , others may develop symptom result disruption ocular surface , include anatomy nerve . Subjects surgery procedure longer provide direct postoperative care may participate study . Routine followup post operative care disqualify subject participation . Subjects receive postoperative care must obtain approval clinician participate study . Individuals eye condition affect shape condition cornea , individual keratoconus . Experienced contact lens wearer appropriate study use lens ( soft , rigid gas permeable [ RGP ] , hard [ PMMA ] ) type lens within FDA approve modality ( daily , continuous extend wear ) replacement cycle ( example , daily , one week , one month , etc . ) describe lens package insert and/or prescribe eye care provider investigate ocular surface data , lens use . Normal individual , without dry eye diagnosis , without dry eye symptom wear contact act control focus area study . Individuals eye medical condition ( ) contraindicate perform screen measurement eligible study . Specific example include : Individuals dilate exam and/or medical history indict narrow anterior chamber angle , glaucoma , contraindication dilation ( like arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease ) . Individuals follow participate contact lens study : presence ocular systemic allergy disease ( infection ) , clinically significant ( grade 3 4 ) corneal edema , corneal vascularization , abnormality cornea , tarsal abnormality bulbar injection use medication might interfere contact lens wear . Individuals participate aspect study : pregnant become pregnant lactating , infectious disease ( e.g . hepatitis , tuberculosis ) immunosuppressive disease ( e.g . HIV ) . Individuals know sensitivity dye numb drop screen use agent . Individuals wear dental brace involve measurement dental impression/bite bar require . The impression material stick brace . Individuals sensitive teeth loose denture may difficulty make dental impression .</criteria>
