	<brief_title>Effects Treatment PTSD Reduced Recall Fear Extinction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It estimate nearly 70 % individual experiment least life traumatic event ( eg war , natural disaster , accident assault ) . The psychotrauma , whose symptom ( include revivalism , hypersensitivity environment , anxiety , avoidance behavior ) , may sustainable thus constitute posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . One characteristic PTSD study laboratory lack recall extinction condition fear , cause largely lack induction hyperactivation prefrontal cortex . Knowing hyperactivation may occur case remission symptom PTSD , possible deficit recall extinction lift case . This idea also support animal model show induction natural artificial prefrontal hyperactivation facilitate recall extinction . However , study yet address far effect different treatment ( conventional : pharmacotherapy psychotherapy , rTMS : repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ) PTSD , suppose induce prefrontal hyperactivation avoid recall deficit extinction condition fear . The persistence deficit beyond remission PTSD symptom could represent situation high risk relapse . Objective . Our main objective examine performance recall extinction condition fear one hand , patient remission PTSD conventional treatment , secondly , patient receive rTMS 10 Hz Population : THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY include 9 patient PTSD , 3 individual remission PTSD , 3 psychotraumatized subject without secondary PTSD 3 individual without history psychotrauma . These group match age , sex sociocultural level . Method : All study conduct Nice University Hospital . The pre-inclusion visit ( D-7 ) , include different clinical evaluation ( MINI-DSM-IV , CAPS , PDI , Hamilton Depression Scale Covi Anxiety ) , hold Emergency Psychiatric Unit ( Hospital Saint-Roch ) . The study take place Psychiatry University Department Neurology Exploration Department ( Hospital Pasteur ) , subject clinical assessment ( D0 , D17-D19 , D21 ) , condition test extinction ( day 0 ) recall test extinction ( D21 ) . The fear conditioning ( measure increase heart rate skin conductance ) correspond presentation couple image tactile stimulation ( intensity choose subject ) , session extinction extinction recall correspond presentation image alone ( without tactile stimulation ) . In addition session , one third PTSD patient treat rTMS 10 Hz ( D3 D7 D10-D14 , 1 session / day ) , another third placebo treatment one third without treatment . Eventually ( D21 ) , two test indirectly ass prefrontal hyperactivation ( emotional Stroop attentional bias ) self-questionnaires perform subject immediately recall extinction . The persistent failure recall extinction individual remission PTSD would sign maintenance prefrontal dysfunction , therefore high risk relapse . The induction hyperactivation use prefrontal rTMS 10 Hz would reduce symptom PTSD , also reduce risk recurrence symptom .</detailed_description>
