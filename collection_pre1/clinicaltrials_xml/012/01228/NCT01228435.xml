	<brief_summary>IPI-504 block protein cancer cell also normal cell . This protein call Heat Shock Protein-90 ( Hsp90 ) . Hsp90 help protect certain protein destroy cell . These protein mutate give signal allow cancer cell keep grow . By block function Hsp90 , hope cancer cell block mutate protein cause cancer cell die . This drug use research study laboratory information research study suggest thsi drug may help treat lung cancer ALK mutation . In research study , look see effect IPI-504 patient lung cancer ALK mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IPI-504 NSCLC Patients With ALK Translocations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants receive study drug ( IPI-504 ) twice weekly two week follow 10 day without study treatment . This 3-week period call cycle . Participants receive total 4 dos per cycle . On day participant receives study drug , come clinic give IPI-504 . Participants continue receive study drug additional cycle long benefit experience severe side effect . - Participants CT scan assess size location tumor . They may also PET scan combination PET/CT scan . Imaging do begin treatment every five six week study assess tumor respond IPI-504 . - The following test procedures do prior first dose IPI-504 : physical examination , vital sign , routine blood test , EKGs , serum urine pregnancy test ( woman child-bearing potential ) . - After first dose IPI-504 , follow test procedure do : EKGs , vital sign ( pulse ) . - For visit day throughout study , follow exam , test procedures do : physical examination , vital sign , blood test , tumor image assessment , MRI brain ( applicable ) , review medication answer question side effect change health . - After final dose study drug follow test procedure do within 30 day : physical examination , ECOG Performance status , blood test , review medication answer question side effect change health .</detailed_description>
