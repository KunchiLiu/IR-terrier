	<brief_summary>Background : - Individuals dependent alcohol often feelings anxiety , irritability , anger , depression . These feeling , well stress , may contribute risk relapse continue drinking . Studies show alcohol consumption increase activity certain molecule brain know CRH1 receptor , key produce body response stress , whose activation generate feeling anxiety . Researchers interested learn whether experimental drug pexacerfont , block CRH1 receptor study individual anxiety disorder depression , lessen anxiety crave alcohol part alcohol-dependence treatment . Objectives : - To determine safety effectiveness pexacerfont treatment anxiety-related alcohol craving . Eligibility : - Individuals 21 65 year age alcohol-dependent problem anxiety . Design : - This study require inpatient admission NIH Clinical Center approximately 1 month , two additional study visit 1 week 1 month discharge hospital . - Participants screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test . - During inpatient period , participant standard treatment alcohol dependence , include support intervention institute staff address craving , anxiety , psychological problem . Participants receive formal psychological treatment psychiatric medication anxiety , receive train relaxation technique . - Participants assign take either pexacerfont placebo 3 week . During time , participant follow procedure : - Frequent blood test . - Rating scale questionnaire alcohol craving anxiety . - Dexamethasone suppression test frequent blood draw study hormone response stress . - Social stress test involve public speaking , follow blood sample questionnaires alcohol crave . - Cue Reactivity ( CR ) session study craving responses alcohol-based cue . - Functional magnetic resonance image scan evaluate brain activity take medication placebo . - Participants two follow-up visit additional blood test questionnaires effect treatment ^ .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : To evaluate pexacerfont , orally available , brain penetrant selective CRH1 antagonist ability modulate emotional motivational process anxious , recently detoxify alcohol dependent patient . STUDY POPULATION : Up 70 anxious , alcohol dependent subject , age 21-65 year enrol complete study 50 patient . DESIGN Subjects inpatient enter present protocol withdrawal treatment , need , complete . They undergo interview construction guide imagery script 3 day pre-treatment phase , receive randomize double blind treatment active medication placebo 23 day , follow 3 day post-treatment inpatient monitoring phase , two follow-up outpatient visit . While hospitalize , repeat measure spontaneous crave alcohol , rating psychopathology , blood chemistry include cortisol obtain time . During second week treatment , crave response assessed challenge session combine social stressor exposure physical alcohol cue . During final week , three session guide imagery carry , separate day counter-balanced order , expose subject personalize stress- , alcohol- neutral condition associate stimulus . The final week also include fMRI session emotional motivational task , day separate guide imagery session . Subjects remain hospitalized throughout study , remain unit 3 day post-medication monitoring period , return follow app . 1 4 week follow completion randomize treatment . OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome crave alcohol guide imagery challenge session . Secondary outcome include crave measure combine social stress alcohol cue challenge session , spontaneous crave psychopathology rating repeatedly measure inpatient unit time . Exploratory blood biomarkers brain response positive negative affective stimulus fMRI session also obtain .</detailed_description>
