	<brief_summary>This study determine efficacy small molecule CDK4/6 inhibitor PD 0332991 ( measure progression free survival 6 month ) patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme gliosarcoma Rb positive . A total 30 patient treat ; 15 undergo plan surgical resection receive drug 7 day prior surgery , follow drug recovery surgery , 15 patient receive drug without plan surgical procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study PD 0332991 Patients With Recurrent Rb Positive Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 30 patient recurrent Glioblastoma Gliosarcoma treat PD 0332991 dose 125 mg daily 21 consecutive day follow 7 day break therapy ( cycle length 28 day ) . Of 30 patient , 15 receive drug 7 day prior indicate , intend surgical resection progression , resume drug dose recovery surgery . Treatment repeat every 28 day , absence disease progression patient may receive treatment 12 cycle . At time patient give option continue study past 12 cycle , maximum 24 cycle . Following registration , available block slide previous surgery must submit diagnosis review ( confirmation Glioblastoma multiforme Gliosarcoma ) Rb status determination . Only patient Rb positive tumor treat , Rb tumor status must know prior treatment . Additional tissue previous surgery also obtain evaluate molecular abnormality tumor . These study do retrospectively require perform prior registration . Monitoring include clinical neurological exam begin cycle ( every 4 week ) . Complete blood count differential examine day 1 15 cycle . Liver renal function perform every 4 week . Toxicity dose modification base NCI CTCAE Version 4 . Disease status assess clinically cycle ( every 4 week ) radiographically second cycle ( every 8 week ) .</detailed_description>
