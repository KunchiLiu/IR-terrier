	<brief_title>We Can Prevent Diabetes : A Behavioral Intervention Reduce Diabetes Risk African Americans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-diabetes , characterize glucose level normal diagnostic criterion diabetes , increasingly common condition affect approximately 54 million U.S. adult . African Americans disproportionately affected pre-diabetes experience high rate diabetes-associated morbidity mortality include damage circulatory system , kidney , nervous system . Patients pre-diabetes increase physical activity improve diet reduce risk develop diabetes . Psychological distress negatively influence course disease increase deleterious health behavior ; prevent schedule maintenance positive behavior change ; stimulate HPA-axis activation dysregulation , may direct impact insulin resistance glucose metabolism . African Americans may increase exposure stress increase vulnerability adverse stress-related health outcome like diabetes , unique history , sociocultural experience , societal position U.S . Helping individual reduce stress increase healthy cop strategy may enhance conventional diabetes prevention effort , especially among African Americans . Mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) , mind-body practice wide range health benefit , show result statistically significant reduction psychological stress anxiety randomize , control study . Mindfulness train cost-effective comparison small-group individualized program , teach safely effectively well-trained instructor . There little research , randomize , control trial MBSR treatment individual pre-diabetes . There also little research acceptability MBSR program prediabetic subgroup African Americans , acceptability MBSR program general population African Americans . Overall goal exploratory pilot study study potential efficacy diabetes prevention education program include train mindfulness-based stress reduction pre-diabetic African Americans . Specific Aims 1 ) determine feasibility develop clinical trial compare effectiveness mindfulness-based diabetes prevention program ( treatment group ) conventional diabetes prevention program ( control group ) improve glucose metabolism pre-diabetic African American adult ; 2 ) identify relevant physiological psychological secondary outcome associate mindfulness-based , educational self-care program African-Americans pre-diabetes ; 3 ) ass acceptability cultural relevance MBSR pre-diabetic African Americans via post-intervention qualitative study , include interview participant , dropout , instructor ; 4 ) identify , find solution , problem conduct well-powered clinical trial ass efficacy mindfulness-based diabetes prevention program improving glucose metabolism pre-diabetic African-Americans .</detailed_description>
