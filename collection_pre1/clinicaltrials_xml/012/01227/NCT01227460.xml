	<brief_summary>This multi-center , prospective , randomize , double-blind , parallel , placebo control clinical trial evaluate efficacy sitagliptin suppress glucagon release subject type 1 diabetes 16 week treatment period . The hypothesis study sitagliptin ( Januvia™ ) decrease post-prandial glucagon release may result improved glucose control adult patient type 1 diabetes . There one small , pilot study sitagliptin patient type 1 diabetes significantly reduce total daily insulin dose A1c value improve mean blood glucose ( MBG ) time spend euglycemic range ( 1 ) . In pilot study , GLP-1 glucagon level assess . The purpose trial determine sitagliptin suppress paradoxical rise glucagon , thus decrease A1c . This study enroll maximum 140 patient ( expect 10 % dropout rate ) A1c value 7.5-10 % randomize 1:1 fashion either study drug placebo . 100 patient wear continuous glucose monitor . Subjects may use insulin via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII ) multiple daily injection ( MDI ) . The clinic visit conduct screening , -1 week , baseline/randomization , 4 week , 12 week , 16 week addition telephone visit ( Appendix 1 2 ) . At home , start week 0 ( randomization/baseline ) , subject take 100 mg/day sitagliptin placebo continue study duration . Laboratory analysis perform various time point assess glucagon , A1c , C-peptide , glucagon-like-peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) , glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP ) , insulin level .</brief_summary>
