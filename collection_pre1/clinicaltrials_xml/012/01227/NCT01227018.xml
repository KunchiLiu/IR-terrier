	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Heat shock protein ( HSP ) 90 inhibitor STA-9090 may stop growth tumor cell block protein need cell growth . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well hsp90 inhibitor STA-9090 work second- third-line therapy treatment patient metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PhII Study STA-9090 Second Third-Line Therapy Metastatic Pancreas Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure 8-week disease control ( CR + PR + SD ) rate therapy STA-9090 patient metastatic pancreas cancer fail ( either progress tolerate ) one two line prior therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate ( RECIST criterion v1.1 ) . II . To determine overall survival . III . To evaluate safety toxicity profile patient population . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . We obtain patient blood sample pre post therapy ( 1 week therapy ) isolate serum interrogation variety biomarkers ( eg AKT , Stat3 , Caspase 3 ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive Hsp90 inhibitor STA-9090 intravenous ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 week .</detailed_description>
