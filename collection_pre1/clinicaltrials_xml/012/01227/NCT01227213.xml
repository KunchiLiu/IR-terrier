	<brief_summary>Rationale : The introduction angiogenesis inhibitor , like sunitinib bevacizumab , improve outcome patient several type cancer remarkably . However , application hamper side effect , development hypertension consequence renal cardiac function . Moreover patient treat angiogenesis inhibitor may suffer weight loss , insulin sensitivity treatment appear change . The treatment angiogenesis inhibitor , improve life expectancy patient various cancer diagnose therefore clinical relevance short term long lasting adverse event translate reduce quality life . In addition , premature withdrawal angiogenesis inhibitor due side effect may result low response , short duration response possibly shorter survival . Therefore , adequate treatment mention side effect patient treat angiogenesis inhibitor relevance response rate , duration progression free survival overall survival quality life . Mechanistic insight pathogenesis side effect help optimize treatment . Objective : The primary objective study investigate effect sunitinib endothelial function , insulin sensitivity , renal function renal blood flow . Study design : Single-centre non randomize observational study Study population : 30 Patients ( &gt; 18 year old ) start sunitinib treatment metastatic renal cell carcinoma .</brief_summary>
