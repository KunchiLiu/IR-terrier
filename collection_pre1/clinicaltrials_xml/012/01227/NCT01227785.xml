	<brief_summary>This study 2 purpose : The first purpose study test new family Boston Scientific Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators ( `` ICDs '' ) cardiac resynchronization therapy ICDs ( `` CRT-Ds '' ) show well new device work patient . This new family call INCEPTA ICD INCEPTA CRT-D . The second purpose study collect data feature monitor breathe . It call Respiratory Rate Trend ( RRT ) . These data help good understand change breathe relate change clinical condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Purpose Study purpose I : To evaluate document appropriate clinical performance INCEPTA ( DR VR ) implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) system INCEPTA cardiac resynchronization therapy ICD ( CRT-D ) system associate application software . Study purpose II : Demonstrate clinical relevance chronic ambulatory daily median Respiratory Rate Trend ( RRT ) HF patient Study Device - INCEPTA ( DR VR ) implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) system ( Models F160 , F161 , F162 , F163 ) - INCEPTA cardiac resynchronization therapy ICD ( CRT-D ) system ( Models P162 , P163 , P165 ) Indication ICD / CRT-D Indication accord standard clinical practice Study Objectives The study two primary objective , link respective study purpose : For purpose I : The objective collect data clinical performance INCEPTA ICD CRT-D device standard clinical use implant , pre-discharge 1-month post-implant . Clinical performance include analysis pacing threshold , pace impedance , sense threshold , number successfully convert VT/VF episode , induce episodes detection time , spontaneous episode , wanded telemetry , adverse event ( AEs ) product experience . For purpose II : The objective show daily median respiratory rate increase patient experience HF-event ( Group 1 ) patient experience HF-event ( Group 2 ) . This prospective , multi-centre , field follow study . Up 35 study center International geography enrol 120 patient .</detailed_description>
