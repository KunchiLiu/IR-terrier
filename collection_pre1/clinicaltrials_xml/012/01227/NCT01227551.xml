	<brief_summary>Approximately 63 patient stage IIIc stage IV melanoma receive 10 intratumoural injection CAVATAK ( Coxsackievirus A21 ) 18 week . Disease progression monitor compute tomography ( CT ) rat RECIST 1.1 assessment criterion . Patients monitor 1 year first treatment . CAVATAK oncolytic ( cancer kill ) virus . Direct injection virus tumor may kill cancer cell lytic action virus . This action also release tumor cell debris may illicit response patient immune system tumour . This study seek assess performance CAVATAK action late stage melanoma . Study objectives include : - Immune-related Progression-Free Survival - Durable Response Rate - Progression Free Survival 6 month - Quality Life</brief_summary>
