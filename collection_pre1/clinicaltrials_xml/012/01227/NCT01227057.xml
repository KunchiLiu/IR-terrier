	<brief_title>Hoarding Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research show hoard disorder ( HD ) debilitate chronic progressive condition significant public health implication . Older adult represent large group HD suffers due increase severity age . Often , Veterans HD see VA system status hoard never assess . Providers treat patient health social service issue yet miss important source disability distress . This insidious , often undetected condition lead great medical social disability costly VA system patient continue decompensate . When HD even detect , patient VA receive indefinite case management inadequate treatment . The case investigator know cause significant financial burden investigator ' system . Most importantly , HD cause significant impairment poor quality life Veterans , particularly old Veterans . Unfortunately , investigator know nothing treat late life HD . Nor investigator know neurocognitive feature impact treatment response , investigator strongly suspect influence treatment outcome . HD potentially treatable source disability VA system - one VA must research treat . This study represent first randomize control trial novel intervention treatment HD old Veterans . The main objective proposal refine test new treatment hoard old Veterans ( age 60-85 ) accomplish series treatment development phase ( case series , open label trial ) randomize control trial . The new treatment ( Cognitive Remediation Exposure Therapy hoarding ; CogRET ) hypothesis driven base late life anxiety literature , consultation mentor , result pilot study use standard cognitive-behavioral intervention , several case series complete prior start Career Development Award ( CDA ) . The first draft CogRET complete currently use several case study . The research training plan divide 5 phase ; 1 ) training preparation 2 ) training , case study use CogRET , modification CogRET 3 ) training , open label trial CogRET , modification CogRET 4 ) randomize control trial 5 ) presenting , publishing , dissemination result submission VA Merit grant . Primary hypothesis include 1 ) randomize CogRET , old Veterans HD show significant decrease acquisition , difficulty discarding , excessive clutter compare randomized case management 2 ) executive functioning ( EF ) significant moderator treatment response . Other mediator moderate treatment response ( psychiatric , medical , demographic , etc . ) explore .</detailed_description>
