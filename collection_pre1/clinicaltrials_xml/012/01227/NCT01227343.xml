	<detailed_description>The purpose study measure compare gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) level occipital cortex group healthy smoke non-smoking woman men age 18-50 . We recruit woman regular menstrual cycle assess premenstrual impact smoke cessation population compare GABA level concentration across group . Although several note-worthy difference male female regard smoke behavior , ultimately none worrisome disparity ability quit smoking . While multiple explanation woman less successful abstinence attempt proffer , observation woman likely experience emergence depressive symptom smoke cessation , know risk factor relapse , may important contributor sex-specific recidivism . Several line evidence suggest nicotine modulation GABA may play important role interplay sex , depression , smoke recidivism .</detailed_description>
