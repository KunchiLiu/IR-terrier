	<brief_summary>Background study hypothesis : Refeeding syndrome dangerous condition could arise patient little food many day , start form feeding . The metabolic consequence condition could affect heart , lung nervous system patient cause serious imbalance level salt body . The available guideline predict refeeding syndrome may occur subjective since depend mainly history sometimes difficult obtain patient . The main biochemical landmark refeeding syndrome occur fall phosphate level feed start . There currently biochemical marker identify patient risk develop refeeding syndrome . Leptin IGF1 hormone observe go someone little food . The investigator therefore hypothesize use combination leptin IGF1 value 'Refeeding Index ' would make latter useful biochemical marker predict refeeding may occur , hence take precautionary measure avoid occurrence start feeding . Design : Thirty five consecutive patient refer commencement parenteral nutrition ( PN ) include . Serum leptin IGF1 measure prior start PN . Electrolytes , liver renal function test measure daily one week initiate PN . The primary outcome decrease phosphate day two three initiate PN . A 'Refeeding Index ' ( RI ) define leptin x IGF1 divide 2800 produce ratio 1.0 patient well nourished .</brief_summary>
