	<brief_title>Study Neuro-protective Effect Granulocyte-colony Stimulating Factor Early Stage Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) second common neurodegenerative disease severity PD still progress ensue year . Currently , promise medical surgical treatment abrogate disease deterioration . Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , one hematopoietic growth factor , routinely use hematologic disorder stem cell harvest normal subject . G-CSF also demonstrate neuroprotection rodent PD model . We hypothesize G-CSF exert effectiveness neuroprotection PD patient .</detailed_description>
