	<brief_summary>In standard treatment , seed place throughout prostate treat entire prostate . This do impossible know cancer locate within prostate . A new technique develop use ultrasound image probably biopsy . Using technique , area likely contain prostate cancer identified.In early study 15 subject , test method plan prostate seed implant safe do part regular care . Areas identify suspicious cancer treat high dos radiation area demonstrate cancer treat standard minimum dose . The high dose area receive two time minimum dose prostate usually receive . Because technique perfect , area identify cancerous treated case cancer area technique identify . Subjects enrol study follow ultrasound technique next two year monitor change cancerous area undergo biopsy two year procedure . Subjects , course , monitor assess success technique side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Ultrasound Spectrum Analysis ( USA ) Guide Dose Escalated Prostate Brachytherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate brachytherapy increasingly popular treatment clinically localized prostate cancer.In properly select patient , highly effective biochemical ( PSA ) disease free survival rate 80-87 % 5-10 years.However , technique currently limited inability localize cancer within prostate . The multifocal nature prostate cancer well establish . Because inability know within prostate cancer locate , radiation must deliver throughout gland . Although blind approach lead good result , clear region prostate surround tissue overexpose radiation others underexposed relative true need base tumor burden proximity tumor areas.Feleppa et al . Riverside Research Institute ( New York , NY ) , non-profit ultrasound research center , develop ultrasound-based technique identify cancer-containing area within prostate . This technique use current ultrasound equipment already use prostate brachytherapy guidance . By extract processing radiofrequency signal obtain ultrasound transducer way do create standard B-mode ultrasound image , area cancer identify display overlie standard B-mode ultrasound image.In study , propose obtain ultrasound-based cancer-specific image prostate prior brachytherapy use direct dosimetry planning.The primary goal study demonstrate image modality incorporate treatment plan process brachytherapy . Furthermore , wish demonstrate improve dosimetry cancer-identified region maintain urethral dose guideline note . We also wish compare difference dose adjacent normal structure ( anterior rectum right leave neurovascular bundle ) . Additionally , seek demonstrate , minimum , increase toxicity approach similar disease control rate . Of course , ultimately goal demonstrate superior therapeutic ratio technique .</detailed_description>
