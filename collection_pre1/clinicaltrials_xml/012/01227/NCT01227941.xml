	<brief_summary>This study determine whether MK-4827 safely administer combination pegylated liposomal doxorubicin , , obtain estimate benefit combination patient ovarian cancer compare historical data single agent pegylated liposomal doxorubicin . The first part study ( Part A ) design determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) evaluate safety MK-4827 , administer combination pegylated liposomal doxorubicin . Part B design assess preliminary clinical activity MK-4827 , administer combination pegylated liposomal doxorubicin participant ovarian cancer . It hypothesize MK-4827 administer , conjunction pegylated liposomal doxorubicin , acceptable tolerability MK-4827 , administer conjunction pegylated liposomal doxorubicin , demonstrate tumor response rate equal superior historical data pegylated liposomal doxorubicin alone .</brief_summary>
