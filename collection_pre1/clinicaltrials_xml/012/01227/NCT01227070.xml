	<brief_summary>This study longitudinal single-center pilot study design describe change lung function level noninvasive biomarkers airway inflammation child age 6-18 year two month follow hospitalization acute exacerbation asthma . Forty child age 6-18 year asthma admit Children 's Hospital Regional Medical Center ( GCRC ) asthma exacerbation enrol complete initial study visit prior hospital discharge . Children asthma recruit inpatient medical unit . During initial visit subject undergo clinical assessment perform spirometry measure lung function . In addition , exhale nitric oxide ( eNO ) concentration measure sample exhale breath condensate ( eBC ) collect 20 minute tidal breathing . Breath condensate analyze determine concentration cysteinyl leukotrienes ( CysLT ) , important mediator airway inflammation asthma . Subjects asthma return GCRC pediatric satellite Seattle Children 's Hospital follow-up study visit 1 week , 2 week , 4 week follow hospital discharge . During follow-up visit subject complete questionnaire regard symptom medication use since recent study visit , perform spirometry , eNO concentration measure breath condensate collect CysLT analysis . The aims observational study : 1 . Assess association level exhale nitric oxide cysteinyl leukotrienes breath condensate measure airflow obstruction ( FEV1 ) asthma symptom , one , two , four week follow hospital discharge asthma exacerbation . 2 . Compare level exhale nitric oxide cysteinyl leukotrienes breath condensate child age 6-18 year hospitalize status asthmaticus level age-matched healthy control subject without asthma .</brief_summary>
