	<brief_title>Early Whole Blood Patients Requiring Transfusion After Major Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The acquire coagulopathy trauma responsible large percentage early death civilian trauma practice major cause battlefield mortality . Widespread recognition provide rationale fundamental change initial management severely injured patient prevention hypothermia , damage control surgery , massive transfusion protocol early triage intensive care unit optimize resuscitation . Despite major advance , hemorrhage remain leading cause early death civilian trauma military combat casualty care . However , unclear early whole blood affect coagulopathy cohort patient compare current standard care . Objective/Hypothesis : The proposal assess patient require massive transfusion accurately predict early emergency department arrival ass use store whole blood initial resuscitation reduce transfusion need compare transfusion component therapy thus improve outcome . Study Design : As first step test hypothesis , test commonly utilize point care analysis device determine reliability predict transfusion requirement severely injured trauma patient within 20 minute arrival emergency department . Furthermore , prospectively randomize severely injured patient require blood transfusion receive either store whole blood pool platelet component therapy ( pack red blood cell , fresh frozen plasma , platelet , current standard care ) compare ability store whole blood reduce transfusion need improve clinical outcome . Relevance : Severe uncontrollable coagulopathy major trauma patient continue major determinant trauma mortality . The proposed effort aim provide early , coagulopathy-based prediction model identify patient risk massive transfusion . Moreover , proposal intend evaluate early store whole blood transfusion risk patient population determine store whole blood 's ability prevent control severe coagulopathy compare standard transfusion care .</detailed_description>
