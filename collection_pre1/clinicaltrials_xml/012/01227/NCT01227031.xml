	<brief_summary>Androgenic alopecia , common form hair loss highly heritable disorder considerable social significance affect around 40 % adult men woman . A variety genetic environmental factor likely play role androgenetic alopecia . Genetic variant human androgen receptor gene ( AR ) report associated AGA Caucasians . Other gene involve hair loss also find . One gene chromosome 3 ( 3q26 ) . A recent genome-wide association study 296 individual male-pattern baldness 347 control carry five SNPs chromosome 20p11 find highly significant association AGA ( rs2180439 combine P = 2.7 x 10 ( -15 ) ) . No interaction detect X-chromosomal androgen receptor locus , suggest 20p11 locus role yet-to-be-identified androgen-independent pathway . The total number evaluate patient androgenic alopecia least 300 . All patient group good responder poor responder conventional medication , topical minoxidil systemic finasteride . Candidate gene potentially involve gout treatment response select published literature ; specifically , two resource candidate gene select : ( ) gene know directly link androgenic alopecia , ( ii ) gene potentially implicate particular pathway androgen/estrogen receptor , metabolism downstream signal , gene involve anti-oxidants hair growth . The SNP genotyping perform MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry . Data analysis perform compare SNPs allele frequency good responder poor responder conventional medication patient androgenic alopecia compare allele frequency SNPs healthy control . A functional study also do prove genetic association .</brief_summary>
