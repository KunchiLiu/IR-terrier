	<brief_summary>Background : - Central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSC ) disease fluid accumulate retina cause distort vision . CSC often resolve without treatment , chronic CSC fluid persist lead permanent visual loss . Chronic CSC may partly cause hormone call androgen . - Finasteride drug modulate effect androgens ; currently market treatment male pattern baldness benign prostate enlargement . The result previous brief study suggest finasteride safe may help reduce effect chronic CSC . However , long-term data need evaluate whether finasteride safe effective treatment chronic CSC . Objectives : - To collect data safety effectiveness finasteride treatment chronic central serous chorioretinopathy . Eligibility : - Individuals previously participate NCT00837252 ( NIH protocol 09-EI-0075 ) , Pilot Study Evaluation Finasteride Treatment Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy , demonstrate clinical improvement finasteride treatment . Design : - The study require 11 visit NEI outpatient clinic 5 year , visit occur every 6 month . Participants screen medical history , physical examination , eye examination , blood urine test . - At visit , participant receive supply finasteride pill take every day need bring leftover finasteride pills follow visit . - Participants eye examination test vision , eye pressure , eye movement , retinal thickness . Additional eye examination evaluate retina 's sensitivity light study blood vessel flow blood eye . - Blood urine sample take throughout study . - After end study , participant may able speak doctor continue finasteride treatment prescription .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSC ) choroidal disorder characterize accumulation serous fluid retina . Although acute CSC tend spontaneously resolve minimal sequela , chronic CSC tend persist lead irreversible visual loss . The pathogenesis CSC complex ; however , systemic androgen may involve . A recent study NCT00837252 ( NIH protocol 09-EI-0075 ) , `` Pilot Study Evaluation Finasteride Treatment Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy , '' suggest finasteride , androgen modulate medication widely use treatment various condition , may efficacious treatment chronic CSC . The objective study continue evaluation participant complete NCT00837252 ( NIH protocol 09-EI-0075 ) clinically respond treatment finasteride . Study Population : Up five participant previously enrol NCT00837252 ( NIH protocol 09-EI-0075 ) demonstrate clinical improvement finasteride treatment . Design : This 5-year pilot extension study allow participant demonstrated clinical improvement finasteride chronic CSC continue receive finasteride off-label treatment . Study visit occur every six month 5-year duration . Participants receive finasteride serous fluid present , unless deem chronic non-responders ( define serous fluid unchanged compare baseline serous fluid stabilize improvement finasteride treatment ) . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome change best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) two year compare baseline . Secondary outcome measure include annual change BCVA , change subretinal fluid volume measure optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) ( 30 % reduction subretinal fluid baseline consider `` treatment success '' NEI standard ) , change leakage observe fluorescein angiography ( FA ) , change plaque size observe indocyanine green angiography ( ICG ) , change fundus autofluorescence pattern observe fundus autofluorescence ( FAF ) imaging , change microperimetry pattern , change serum level testosterone dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) , well change urine level cortisol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant previously participate NCT00837252 ( NIH protocol 09EI0075 ) , Pilot Study Evaluation Finasteride Treatment Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy , demonstrate clinical improvement , indicate reduction subretinal fluid measure OCT . Participant subretinal fluid present macula volume least 0.1 microliter cause visual change ( reduced acuity , metamorphopsia microperimetry deficit ) warrant treatment . Participant must understand sign protocol 's informed consent document . Participant agrees take appropriate precaution ensure person pregnant , nurse childbearing potential handle finasteride tablet . [ All NCT00837252 ( NIH protocol 09EI0075 ) participant male give male predilection disease . ] EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant abnormal liver function test ( LFT ) define elevated alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) level great twice respective upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( i.e. , ALT great 82 U/L and/or AST great 68 U/L ) . If participant ALT AST level great twice ULN , participant enrol cleared hepatology . Participant steroid medication ( oral , topical inhale ) .</criteria>
