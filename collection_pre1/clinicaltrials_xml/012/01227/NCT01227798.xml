	<brief_summary>A Pilot Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy interferon-Alfacon1 ( INFERGEN ) treatment patient hospitalize Influenza-like illness cause novel swine origin Influenza virus circulate Influenza Viruses . The use Interferon-alfacon1 co-treatment along standard care antiviral hypothesize safe . Clinical improvement patient hypothesize quicker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Interferon Treat Patients Hospitalized Influenza</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study see use medication call INFERGEN , help get rid virus and/or help immune response prevent illness get bad lung . We hope INFERGEN either prevent patient get bad require intensive care decrease time need intensive care . The Interferon-alpha ( also call Interferon-alphacon1 IFN-alphacon1 INFERGEN ) immune molecule , show work different virus ( anti-viral ) . Interferon standard treatment patient chronic ( infection long time ) hepatitis C ( virus affect liver many year ) give 6-12 month . It also use short time 14 day , small study patient respiratory disease cause SARS seem help patient get well rapidly . It also show stop different Influenza virus grow test tube lung tissue . It also show decrease immune response prevent over-reacting virus .</detailed_description>
