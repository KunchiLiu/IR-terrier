	<brief_summary>Infections pose serious threat cancer patient chemotherapy . Prompt diagnosis treatment paramount importance infection may life-threatening immune-compromised individual . Traditionally , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) use marker infection . However , CRP also often elevated cancer patient marker CRP may unreliable cancer patient . Other marker infection include procalcitonin show value diagnose bacterial infection . This study examine procalcitonin potential marker bacterial infection cancer patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose study : Is pro calcitonin marker bacterial infection cancer patient ? Is pro calcitonin well C-reactive-protein identify cancer patient bacterial infection ? Background : Infections , particular bacterial , pose major threat cancer patient treatment relate immuno-suppression general weakness increase risk severity infection . Prompt identification patient bacterial infection necessary . Traditionally , fever , leucocytosis elevate c-reactive protein ( CRP ) use evaluation patient suspected infection . How-ever , fever may reduce analgesic steroid , leucocyte may decrease due anticancer therapy CRP case elevate cancer disease . The diagnosis bacterial infection thus difficult cancer patient . Recently , pro-calcitonin ( PCT ) ( d√¶kker maja 's godt ) Design study : Two group include study : Group I include patient anti-cancer therapy include chemo radiotherapy , target treatment radiotherapy hormone treatment , without sign infection define temperature &lt; 38 C focal symptom infection . Vital sign note blood test haematology , CPR PCT drawn . Details cancer type , stage , treatment history infection less 1 month prior co-morbidity register . Data cohort use assess median CRP PCT among non-infected cancer patient . Forty patient include . Group II include patient anti-cancer therapy include chemo radiotherapy , target treatment radiotherapy hormone treatment , hospitalize suspected infection ( temp &gt; 38 last 24 hour ) . At time hospitalization , vital sign note blood test haematology , CPR PCT drawn . Details cancer type , stage , treatment history infection less 1 month prior co-morbidity register . All hospital record review discharge determine certain diagnosis infection ( positive bacteriology ) , probable infection ( negative bacteriology clinical course consistent bacterial infection ) non infection make . Data cohort use assess role CRP PCT prediction bacterial infection . Forty patient include study .</detailed_description>
