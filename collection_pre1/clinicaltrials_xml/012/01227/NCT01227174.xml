	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Propofol Only Sedation Oral Maxillofacial Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Removal third molar common procedure perform North America . Many surgeon choose complete procedure use procedural sedation . The commonly use combination medication achieve procedural sedation consist midazolam , fentanyl , propofol . Propofol gain increase attention sedative agent due predictable pharmacokinetics favorable amnestic property . These property make propofol attractive sedative agent compare benzodiazepine know slow onset couple much longer offset result prolonged sedative effect well beyond require completion procedure . Several study compare use propofol combination sedatives various control group . These study reliably confirm safety efficacy propofol . Some research speculate difference nausea vomit report patient secondary difference dosage fentanyl group . Others conclude fentanyl provide advantage use intermittent propofol short duration procedure . Recent study find favourable result use propofol achieve procedural sedation . On review Oral Maxillofacial Surgery literature regard topic , lack internally externally validate research discover . Oral Maxillofacial surgical procedure unique duration procedure use local anesthesia make difficult generalize data obtain specialty . All eligible patient assign single group . They ask fill survey determine level anxiety prior procedure . Participants proceed non-study patient see nurse pre-operative assessment . After see nurse , patient see surgeon procedure . Most data ( blood pressure , heart rate , breathe rate etc . ) collect procedure . During procedural sedation monitoring perform usual study patient capnometry add standard care . Capnometry way examine breathing . It measurement carbon dioxide air breathe nose . After procedure complete patient transported recovery must remain minimum 30 minute prior discharge . The nurse recovery monitor recovery continuously stay . The nurse also apply standard recovery score recovery every 5 minute track progression . Once recovered procedural sedation ask complete short questionnaire procedural sedation experience . After discharge patient contact phone 24 48 hour later review final questionnaire .</detailed_description>
