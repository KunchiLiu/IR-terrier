	<brief_title>Study OTSGC-A24 Vaccine Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although palliative chemotherapy improve outcome patient advance Gastric Cancer , prognosis group patient remain poor . Tumor specific antigen angiogenesis pathway potential target immunotherapy . A cocktail peptide vaccine select overcome gastric cancer 's heterogeneous enhance anti-tumor effect . Five HLA-A*2402-binding peptide vaccine derive tumor specific antigens VEGFR1 chosen base frequency expression gastric cancer ability induce specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes . In preclinical model , regulation target siRNA active vaccination result tumor regression . The purpose study evaluate safety optimal dosing schedule cancer vaccine cocktail , OTSGC-A24 target novel specific tumor antigen FOXM1 , DEPDC1 , KIF20A , URLC10 VEGFR1 advance gastric cancer patient HLA-2402 haplotype .</detailed_description>
