	<brief_title>Study Retigabine Immediate Release Adjunctive Therapy Specified Monotherapy Antiepileptic Treatments Adults With Partial-Onset Seizures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multi-centre , flexible dose study retigabine immediate release ( IR ) . The study enroll male female outpatient ( ≥ 18 year age ) partial-onset seizure ( POS ) inadequately control current monotherapy Antiepileptic Drug ( AED ) . Following Screening Period 2 week , subject enter 8-week Baseline Phase determine baseline seizure frequency . At end Baseline Phase , subject meet exceed minimum seizure frequency 4 partial seizure per 56 day , enter Treatment Period ( 4 week Titration , 16 week Flexible Dose Evaluation Phase ) . All subject receive retigabine IR start 150 mg/day titrate 600 mg/day Week 4 . From Week 5 onwards , subject ' dos maintain 300 1200 mg/day use flexible dose regimen optimise response tolerability . The maximum duration study approximately 33 week ( inclusive 3 week Taper/Follow-up Phase ) .</detailed_description>
