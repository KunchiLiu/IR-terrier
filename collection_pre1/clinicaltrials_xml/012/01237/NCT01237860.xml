	<detailed_description>This prospective , one-center , single group , repeat measure , non inferiority study . Forty-five ( 45 ) subject suffer foot drop thigh muscle weakness due upper motor neuron injury disease evaluate study . Each subject study six week . Clinical benefit measure assessment gait performance . In particular test hypothesis NESS L300 Plus System involve foot drop correction thigh muscle activation , may achieve walk enhancement inferior gain use system corrects foot drop ( i.e . NESS L300 ) .</detailed_description>
