	<detailed_description>( 177 ) Lutetium-DOTA-Octreotate Therapy Somatostatin Receptor-Expressing Neuroendocrine Neoplasms First Annual Report protocol IND # 78,256 RITA Foundation collaboration Excel diagnostics Nuclear Oncology center Baylor College Medicine Protocol number 78,256 call recruitment sixty patient protocol . As August 15th , 2011 , enrol 23 patient study age 27 83 year old average 61.6 . Among patient 22 Caucasians ( 95.7 % ) 1 African American ( 4.3 % ) . Eleven patient female ( 48 % ) age 46 83 year old average 63.9 year old . Twelve male patient ( 52 % ) treat age 27 86 year old average 59.58 year old . 15 patient ( 65.2 % ) Gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( GEPNET ) , 7 carcinoid tumor ( 30.4 % ) 1 bronchial carcinoid ( 4.3 % ) . All patient progressive disease multiple distant metastasis poorly respond prior surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , chemo-embolization cold Octreotide treatment . Full phase I dosimetry evaluation , include dosimetric evaluation multiple urine blood sample collection , perform 6 patient submit FDA . Ten patient receive one therapy average dose 199mCi/patient ( 188.52-208.15 mCi ) . Eight patient receive two cycle therapy average dose 390.29mCi/patient ( 363.49-413.26 mCi ) . Two patient receive three therapy average dose 592.11mCi/patient ( 587.52-596.7mCi ) three patient receive four therapy average dose 787.62mCi/patient ( 784.21-794.28 mCi ) . Toxicity Patients evaluate evidence renal , hepatic hematologic toxicity use NCI common toxicity criteria follow cycle therapy . No significant acute toxicity observe immediately follow treatment , patient require supportive treatment therapy . Of 23 evaluable patient , 6 patient ( 26 % ) grade 2 3 hematological toxicity supportive therapy require . Average duration hematological toxicity grade 2 8.3 week ( range 4-16 week ) 4.5 week ( range 1-8 week ) toxicity grade 3 . Grade 2 3 liver toxicity observe 2 patient ( 8.6 % ) . In addition , 2 patient ( 8.6 % ) renal toxicity grade 2 . 11 patient ( 47.8 % ) moderate severe nausea/vomiting treatment recover 1 3 day completion therapy . In one patient ( 4.3 % ) , skin flushing , sweat diarrhea develop therapy recover within 48 hour follow therapy . Response Among 13 patient receive 2 cycle therapy , 4 ( 30 % ) partial response treatment 9 patient ( 70 % ) exhibit stable disease . No disease progression note . 4 patient death report far . None patient able complete four cycle therapy . All patient die result massive tumor burden . The average time interval death last treatment 1.41 month ( 0.76-2.23 month ) .</detailed_description>
