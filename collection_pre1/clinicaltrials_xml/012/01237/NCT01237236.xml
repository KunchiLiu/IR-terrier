	<brief_summary>LEE011 new oral drug design inhibit activity enzyme know CDK4/6 . CDK4/6 involve process allows normal cancer cell divide multiply . Cancer cell often drive divide multiply abnormality increase activity CDK4 . Hence hope block activity CDK4 may slow growth cancer . LEE011 show anti-cancer activity several different tumor model animal . Because CDK4 important normal cancerous cell , LEE011 expect decrease ability bone marrow make white blood cell , platelet , red blood cell . Although effect expect reversible , increase risk infection , bleed fatigue . The primary purpose study find high dose LEE011 safely give adult patient advance solid tumor lymphomas effective standard treatment available . It provide information side effect may occur follow treatment . The study also possibly provide early evidence LEE011 's anti-tumor activity .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients age ≥18 year histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis solid tumor lymphoma effective standard treatment available 2 . Patients must ECOG performance status 0 1 3 . Patients enrol dose expansion phase must least one measurable lesion define RECIST criterion solid tumor Measurable nodal disease baseline define Cheson criterion Lymphoma . 4 . A sufficient interval must elapse last dose prior anticancer therapy ( include cytotoxic biological therapy major surgery ) enrollment study , allow effect prior therapy abate : Cytotoxic chemotherapy : ≥ duration cycle recent treatment regimen ( minimum 2 week regimens , except 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycinC ) . Biologic therapy ( e.g. , antibody ) : ≥ 4 week . 5 . Patients must adequate organ function , define follow parameter : Bone marrow : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L , Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 9 g/dL , Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L Hepatic function : Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) ; AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 x ULN , except patient tumor involvement liver must AST ALT ≤ 5 x ULN Renal function : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN 24hour clearance ≥ 40 ml/min , Serum potassium , magnesium calcium must within normal limit 1 . Patients primary central nervous system tumor brain metastasis . However , radiation therapy and/or surgery complete serial evaluation CT ( contrast enhancement ) MRI minimum 3 month demonstrate disease stable patient remain asymptomatic , patient may enrol . Such patient must need treatment steroid antiepileptic medication . 2 . Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption LEE011 patient history GI surgery may result intestinal blind loops patient clinically significant gastroparesis , unresolved nausea , vomit , diarrhea CTCAE grade &gt; 1 3 . Prior hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow transplantation 4 . Impaired cardiac function clinically significant cardiac disease , include follow : LVEF &lt; 45 % determined MUGA echo Complete leave bundle branch block Obligate use cardiac pacemaker implantable cardioverter defibrillator Congenital long QT syndrome family history unexpected sudden cardiac death History presence ventricular tachyarrhythmia Presence unstable atrial fibrillation ( ventricular response &gt; 100 bpm Clinically significant rest bradycardia QTcF &gt; 450 m male &gt; 470 m female screen ECG Right bundle branch block leave anterior hemiblock ( bifascicular block ) Angina pectoris ≤ 3 month prior dose study drug Acute MI ≤ 3 month prior dose study drug Other clinically significant heart disease 5 . Acute myocardial infarction angina pectoris ≤ 3 month prior start study drug 6 . Patients concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical condition could compromise participation study ( e.g . uncontrolled hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus , clinically significant pulmonary disease , clinically significant neurological disorder , active uncontrolled infection ) .
