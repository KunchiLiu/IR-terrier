	<brief_title>Tailored Antibiotics Prophylaxis Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Past know-how : Antibiotic prophylaxis show effective reduce peristomal infection . [ 9-11 ] The penicillin-or cephalosporin-based antibiotic prophylaxis usually use similar efficacy . [ 12 ] EuropeanSociety Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ( ESGE ) guideline recommend single dose intravenous cephalosporin orpenicillin preparation PEG . [ 17 ] The updated practice guideline American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ( ASGE ) British Society Gastroenterology ( BSG ) also recommend cefazolin cefuroxime prophylactic antibiotic . [ 18-19 ] Question : Is 1st 2nd generation cephalosporin adequate prophylactic antibiotic percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) ? Preliminary result : 1 . The lead two common pathogen cause peristomal infection PEG P. aeuroginosa methecillin-resistanced S. aurous . ( Figure 1 ) These two common pathogen ca n't cover prophylactic antibiotic suggest guideline . 2 . The patient airway infection PEG high peristomal infection rate , compare without airway infection . Moreover , adequate antibiotic prophylaxis could significant improve infection rate . ( Table 1 ) Hypothesis : Tailored antibiotic prophylaxis accord individual throat swab culture could reduce peristomal infection rate . Specific aim : 1 . If individual tailor antibiotic prophylaxis accord throat swab could reduce peristomal infection rate ? 2 . If phenotype genotype analysis compatible infect wound isolate throat swab/sputum isolates ? 3 . If throat swab culture well sputum culture predict peristomal infect microorganism ? 4 . Is infection also link oropharyngeal isolates patient get peristomal infection one week PEG ? Anticipated result : 1 . Individual tailor antibiotic prophylaxis accord throat swab culture could reduce peristomal infection rate PEG short day hospitalization . 2 . Most phenotype genotype compatible peristomal isolates throat swab/sputum isolates . It indicate pathogen carry throat peristomal cause infection . The microorganism isolate throat swab could predict pathogen PEG peristomal infection . 3 . The throat swab culture may better sputum culture predict peristomal infect pathogen unconscious patient difficult collect sputum . 4 . Peristomal infection one week PEG may associate throat pathogen . It may relate contamination wound care . Significances : This proposal result could apply clinical care percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy . The individual chose prophylactic antibiotic could improve peristomal infection rate . Currently , 1st 2nd cephalosporin usually recommend prophylaxis PEG . However , patient ORSA culture nasal cavity , vancomycin suggest prophylaxis study support benefit infection prevention . If result positive , may change clinical guideline antibiotic prophylaxis PEG .</detailed_description>
