	<brief_summary>This national , multicenter , open-label , randomize , comparative study design compare , first , TTP two treatment scheme propose ( MPV follow Rd MPV alternate Rd ) newly diagnose MM patient older 65 year . This comparison perform term efficacy safety . Up 120 patient include treatment arm evaluate scheduled visit 3 study period : Pre-treatment , Treatment Follow-up . Primary outcome measure : - To evaluate efficacy term time progression ( TTP ) 18 month MPV Rd use either sequential alternating approach newly diagnose MM patient older 65 year . - To evaluate toxicity ( safety tolerability ) sequential versus alternate use MPV Rd . Secondary outcome measure : - To evaluate response , duration response , progression free survival ( PFS ) , time next therapy ( TNT ) overall survival ( OS ) two different group patient . - To identify , within group patient treat alternate scheme , biological characteristic ( include comprehensive genomic analysis ) patient resistant one , patient refractory treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Treatment Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Patients Older Than 65 Years With Sequential Melphalan/Prednisone/Velcade ( MPV ) Followed Revlimid/Low Dose Dexamethasone ( Rd ) Versus Alternating Velcade/Melphalan/Prednisone ( MPV ) With Revlimid/Low Dose Dexamethasone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Pre-treatment period include Screening visit . After provide write informed consent form participate study , patient evaluate eligibility screening period 14 day ( Days -14 -1 ) . If patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion randomize moment entry trial 1:1 allocation receive either MPV follow Rd ( Treatment Group A ) MPV alternate Rd ( Treatment Group B ) . Patients Treatment Group A receive nine cycle MPV consist one 6-weeks cycle Velcade ( Bortezomib ) intravenous bolus twice weekly ( day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 22 , 25 , 29 32 ) follow 10 day rest period ( day 33 42 ) , combination oral Melphalan , daily day 1 4 oral Prednisone , daily day 1 4 , follow eight 4-weeks cycle Velcade ( Bortezomib ) intravenous bolus day 1 , 8 , 15 22 follow 6 day rest period ( day 23 28 ) , combination Melphalan Prednisone per os daily day 1 4 , follow 24-day rest period ( day 5 28 ) . After nine MPV cycle , patient receive nine cycle Rd consist 4-weeks cycle , include Revlimid ( lenalidomide ) , daily day 1-21 follow 7 day rest period ( day 22 28 ) plus oral dexamethasone , weekly day 1,8,15 22 , follow 6 day rest period ( day 23 28 ) . Patients Treatment Group B receive schedule therapy , MPV cycle alternate Rd cycle . In treatment Group B , patient randomize start receive either MPV Rd first cycle therapy . Overall , patient receive identical number cycle , nine cycle MPV nine Rd . Patients randomized Treatment Group A relapsing/progressing major toxicity treatment MPV crossover receive Rd , study coordinator approval . During Treatment Period , patient evaluate day 1 cycle . After completion Treatment Period , patient evaluate every 2 month thereafter . Safety assess monitor adverse event , physical examination , vital sign measurement , haematology clinical chemistry test . Response treatment base EBMT IMWG criterion . Response treatment evaluate day 1 induction cycle , every 2 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
