	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers study health nutrition interested develop accurate method determine people eat day day affect general health . In particular , good method need determine people accurately remember ate . One possible method involve use biomarkers , indicator urine , blood , saliva , fat , hair , related intake particular food consistent way . One set biomarkers blood sample hair may use determine relative amount meat , fish , soda ( corn/sugar cane ) person diet . However , research need study effectiveness use biomarkers accurately track dietary intake . Objectives : - To validate use biomarkers representative specific dietary intake pattern ( meat/fish/soda ) . Eligibility : - Healthy , nondiabetic men 18 65 year age . Design : - This study involve initial screen visit 12-13 week inpatient dietary study period . - Participants screen medical history physical examination , well blood urine sample glucose tolerance test exclude individual diabetes . - After 3 day standard weight-maintaining diet , participant glucose tolerance test body fat scan ; provide hair , blood , fat tissue sample ; complete questionnaire performance test . - Participants spend one day metabolic chamber measure energy expenditure general metabolism . - Participants randomize one eight carefully design diet 12 week . The diet differ amount meat , fish , soda , include one diet none three biomarker-related food permit . Blood sample collect throughout study diet period . - At end 12-week study diet period , participant provide additional hair , blood , fat tissue sample , second metabolism assessment metabolic chamber .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Studies health nutrition use variety tool determine people eat day day . Unfortunately , method use accurate variety reason provide solid information base health recommendation public policy . In general , people ask keep track eat recall eat past , make mistake estimate amount specific eat . New tool help determine people accurately remember ate desperately need . Biomarkers thing measure ( urine , blood , hair , etc . ) relate intake particular food consistent way may therefore accurate food record . One set biomarkers may use naturally occur ( present food ) stable isotope carbon nitrogen determine relative amount meat , fish , soda ( corn/sugar cane ) person diet . These isotope measure blood sample hair . The aim study validate use stable isotope biomarkers representative specific dietary intake pattern ( meat/fish/soda ) . This study inpatient study highly specific diet feed volunteer ~12 week stable isotope measure blood hair . The ultimate goal develop biomarkers use validate food intake pattern outpatient clinical epidemiological study .</detailed_description>

Additionally , potential subject might exclude demonstrate style interpersonal relationship would inhibit successful completion study .</criteria>
