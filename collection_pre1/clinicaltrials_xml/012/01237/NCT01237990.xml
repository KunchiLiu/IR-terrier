	<brief_summary>This study design confirm surgeon able perform surface registration standard liver feature use landmark schedule laparoscopic liver procedure . Additionally , registration obtain full insufflation pressure half insufflation pressure laparoscopic procedure . Under presence insufflation pressure , surface liver manually swab study track laparoscopic probe landmark note data collection . After registration liver obtain , registration point obtain procedure evaluate surgeon move track laparoscopic probe liver surface evaluate location track laparoscopic probe display guidance system 3D image . The surgeon accept reject registration accuracy . Upon completion schedule laparoscopic procedure , subject undergo open procedure schedule surgical case . An open liver registration obtain manual swabbing liver use study track probe accept reject surgeon use process describe laparoscopic procedure . In event disease determine great surgical repair laparoscopic stag procedure , minimally invasive liver surface data acquire patient include overall study population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Pathfinder System use study use data collection purpose use surgical procedure image guide system . Preoperative CT scan , obtain standard care , use generate image guide liver system 3D liver surface image use study . During laparoscopic procedure , Pathfinder device insert standard laparoscopic port ( 5mm 10mm ) use staging procedure . For purpose study , subject enrol follow inclusion/exclusion criterion : Inclusion : 1 . Written informed consent must obtain . 2 . Patients enrol must undergo stag laparoscopy intention conversion laparotomy . 3 . Patient must 18 year age old . 4 . Women childbearing age without documented evidence menopause sterility must negative serum urine pregnancy test time screen . Exclusion : 1 . Any condition , judgement clinical investigator designee , might increase risk subject decrease chance obtain satisfactory data achieve objective study . 2 . Patients condition render unable understand nature , scope possible consequence study therefore unable give proper consent . 3 . Patients Cirrhosis liver classify Child-Pugh B C. 4 . Patients undergo liver surgery purpose receive liver transplant . 5 . Patients establish renal insufficiency ( define creatinine great 2.5 mg/dl ) , condition require hemodialysis . A total study population include 20 subject complete laparoscopic open liver procedure schedule .</detailed_description>
