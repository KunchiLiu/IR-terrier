	<brief_summary>The purpose study design compare safety , tolerability , antiviral activity immunological effect lopinavir/ritonavir plus lamivudine ( 3TC ) versus standard therapy 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) plus lopinavir/ritonavir treatment naïve HIV-1 infected subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Lopinavir/ Ritonavir Lamivudine Versus Standard Therapy Naïve HIV-1 Infected Subjects .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combination therapy 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) plus non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) protease inhibitor ( PI ) mainstay therapy 10 year , base sound evidence derive randomize controlled clinical trial epidemiological data.A variety new approach design address problem associate combination highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) currently explore . These include strategic treatment interruption reduce time therapy , toxicity cost ; Based performance , dual drug combination include lopinavir/ritonavir spare toxic NRTIs thymidine nucleoside-analogs , maintain non-thymidine nucleoside-analogs appear potentially simple , safe effective regimen .</detailed_description>

( Patients receive ARV ≤ 48 hour allow ) . 7 . Subject indication receive antiretroviral regimen . 8 . Subjects comply protocol requirement . 9 . Subject 's general medical condition , investigator 's opinion , interfere assessment completion trial . 10 . If female , : 1. use 2 different method birth control include , least , one barrier method , acceptable subject investigator , 2. urine pregnancy test perform Screening Visit Baseline . Results test must negative . 3. continue use 2 different method birth control include , least , one barrier method least 30 day end treatment period 1 . Evidence viral resistance lopinavir/ritonavir , and/or FTC 3TC , and/or nucleoside analogue base genotype resistance test perform screening , consider resistance accord panel IAS USA , version December , 2009 . 2 . The presence follow major mutation : V32I ; I47V / A ; L76V ; V82A/F/T/S presence two minor mutation positions:10,20,24,33,46,50,53,54,63,71,73,84,90 consider resistance lopinavir/ritonavir . 3 . The presence mutation M184V/I and/or K65R consider resistance 3TC FTC . At discretion investigator base resistance test , treatment base lopinavir / ritonavir , plus 3TC FTC similar nucleoside / nucleotide active could construct . 4 . Previously document HIV2 infection . 5 . Use disallow concomitant therapy 6 .
