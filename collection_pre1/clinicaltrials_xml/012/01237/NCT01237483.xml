	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate patient cancer throat recurrent inoperable different modality treatment consist radiation continuously 5 week half associate drug direct receptor cell surface cancer , call Erbitux ® . The investigator hope short treatment ( 1.5 week less usual treatment ) improve antitumor efficacy without additional toxic side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reirradiation Erbitux HNSCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hope treatment improved antitumor efficacy without additional toxic side effect , shorter 1.5 week standard therapy . But hypothesis meet current state knowledge , justifies study . The main hypothesis combination reirradiation Cetuximab give relative gain 15 % complete response rate .</detailed_description>
