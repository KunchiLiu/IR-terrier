	<brief_summary>During surgery , patient may suffer heart attack heart complication , increase hospital stay 11 day average cost estimate US $ 20 billion 1990.Many risk factor identify properly conduct study look Blood pressure ( BP ) risk factor around time surgery . The investigator believe good possibility systolic BP ( SBP ) risk factor currently unrecognized . When measure BP , two number obtain . The upper number call SBP low number call diastolic BP ( DBP ) . If number high , mean patient high BP hypertension . If SBP high DBP normal , call isolated systolic hypertension ( ISH ) &gt; ISH increasingly recognize major risk factor heart problem . The relationship ISH heart complication around time surgery poorly understood . Previous study look relationship . Because , guideline ISH management time surgery . Generally , patient go surgery increase risk . Studies start show bulk heart complication happen patient think low risk factor yet identify , include ISH . The investigator believe oxygen supply heart compromise around time surgery ISH patient Chemicals know stress hormone secrete around time surgery , increase oxygen need heart may make oxygen supply heart muscle critical ( know myocardial ischemia ) . This turn may result heart attack death . Studies show patient myocardial ischemia stand 9-fold increase odds ratio suffer heart attack , worsen angina , death . This study aim compare incidence myocardial ischemia patient ISH normal BP patient around time surgery use special heart monitor . In addition , study aim determine prevalence ISH among surgical patient document complication like heart attack , heart failure , stroke death surgery . This research project conduct Ottawa Hospital multi-disciplinary research group ( perioperative research group ) include anesthesiology , cardiology , general surgery epidemiology . The research group secure HSFO funding study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ethics approval already obtain . Consented patient screen ISH pre-surgical clinic , utilize BP automate machine . Patients ISH normal diastolic function ( control group ) enrol . During surgery , monitor change consistent myocardial ischemia . A special heart monitor , call ambulatory ECG monitor ( Holter monitor ) , use record , document count episodes myocardial ischemia . A designated research coordinator assign study recruitment , screening , daily track data collection . The heart monitoring patient study review research group . Data collect analyse . This first study look exclusively ISH risk factor around time surgery . Studies suggest investigator may label surgical patient risk heart attack `` low risk '' fact bulk heart attack patient label `` low risk '' . The finding ISH patient higher incidence myocardial ischemia provide evidence next level research . If ISH fact risk factor heart attack around time surgery , investigator identify group patient investigator low risk institute appropriate management .</detailed_description>
