	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare GlideScope 速 Fastrach TM intubation morbidly obese . Mainly try clarify instrument produce short intubationtime low number intubationattempts . The hypothesis intubation would 1 ) quicker 2 ) low number attempt , use GlideScope速 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intubation Morbidly Obese Patients . A Clinical Trial , Comparing Glide Scope 速 With Fastrach TM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number obese people rise . Thus 25.2 % Danish 9th grader obese . As result , surgery anesthesia obese patient become frequent . Several potential problem related anesthesia patient group exist , include airway management sufficient oxygenation . Anaesthesia obese patient likely require intubation . In light foregoing , therefore important find method provide few complication related intubation . Therefore study compare two instrument ( Fastrach TM GlideScope 速 ) find method provide best airway management , measure primarily time number intubation attempt .</detailed_description>
