	<brief_title>Injectable Collagenase For Burns ' Associated Contracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific Background : Contracture define scar tissue replace original tissue lead shorten tighten muscle result range motion limitation deformity . Contracture creation common burn 's healing process . The process involve fibrosis effected area include intrusion towards deep layer skin , describe ineffective healing process . In many case scar major functional cosmetic implication challenge plastic surgery department around world . Creation band , webs contracture close joint area cause significant movement limitation shorten range motion . Until recently , failure treatment bandaging , splint physiotherapy activity usually lead surgical intervention involve many kind technique range simple incision , Z-Plasties skin graft , flap . All method mean release contracture restore functional capability . A recent study show 's possible use collagenase enzyme release dupuytren 's contracture simple injection , procedure preform ambulatory condition . This kind contracture cause fix flexion finger towards palm hand . The study double blind , placebo control study involve 308 patient , suffer contracture least 20 degree range movement limitation . In end , prove beyond doubt collagenase effective release restore range motion dupuytren 's contracture . These positive result might indicate possibility use collagenase kind contracture . In study investigator intend perform preliminary test effectiveness collagenase treat contracture develop due burn 's healing process . As comparison parameter investigator compare range motion treatment subjective feeling pain ( , treatment ) accord VAS scale pain . Also investigator try monitor kind side effect might appear . In clinical aspect , study might introduce medical community new kind treatment protocol even might decrease need surgical intervention patient . Goal : A pilot experiment test efficiency enzyme Collagenase treating contractures result 's burn 's healing process . Methods : During study investigator recruit 10 patient suffer know contracture cause movement 's restriction attribute burn 's healing process . These patient meet exclusion inclusion criterion study . Patients sign inform consent accord Helsinki Committee , contain list complication side effect expect . Patients go Collagenase enzyme injection accord protocol conduct dupuytren 's study . Before perform injection , range motion 's limitation measure use goniometer pain scale questionnaire ( VAS ) fill patient . Remeasuring do several time period , first injection , range 24 hour , week , 14 day 28 day . Expected result research significance : So far , treatment choice patient burn 's create movement limit contracture , concentrate around supportive care . Patients refer surgical intervention necessary .Treatment inject external enzyme avant-garde n't do condition . Injections attempt various enzyme hyaluronidase , Collagenase also Gelatinase document literature therapeutic trial Keloid hypertrophic scar aesthetic aspect , find ineffective . However , literature review find evidence therapeutic attempt use Collagenase burn 's healing contracture functional aspect . These process know fibrotic rich collagen deposition . This study might introduce new kind treatment , do ambulatory environment .This type treatment might significantly improve patient ' function quality life , need surgical intervention .</detailed_description>
