	<brief_summary>Hypoglycaemia associate characteristic change EEG appearance slow frequency wave . In recent study investigator show change record subcutaneous electrode process automated mathematical algorithm base non-linear spectral analysis , change present occurrence severe hypoglycaemia type 1 diabetes patient . An alarm device base real-time analysis continuous EEG-recordings may thus possible . For many diabetes patient nocturnal hypoglycaemia fear complication may thus preventable .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EEG Changes type1 Diabetes During Sleep -Insulin Induced Hypoglycemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The different sleep stage associate specific EEG-changes high complexity occurrence slow frequency wave stage deep sleep . The aim study ass EEG change insulin-induced hypoglycaemia type 1 diabetes patient different stage sleep . The core question : ( ) Will pathological hypoglycaemia-related EEG-changes dominate physiological sleep-related change hypoglycaemia occur sleep ? ( ii ) Is possible refine mathematical algorithm extend , EEG-changes hypoglycaemia distinguish sleep-related EEG-changes sleep stage . ( iii ) If , blood-glucose level hypoglycaemia associate EEG-changes detectable ( iv ) Will patient able react adequately ingestion carbohydrates alarm give time hypoglycaemia associate EEG-changes . Twelve patient type 1 diabetes study . EEG record grade hypoglycaemia achieve insulin infusion frequent glucose measurement . EEG analyse automate algorithm visual analysis address question ( ) , ( ii ) ( iii ) . To address question ( iv ) real-time EEG-analysis predefined threshold defining hypoglycaemia perform alarm aim warn patient impede hypoglycaemia . Patients ask consume carbohydrate alarm . During experiment patient continuous observation .</detailed_description>
