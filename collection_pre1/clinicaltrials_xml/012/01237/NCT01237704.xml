	<brief_summary>In Hong Kong , every 30 12.9 100,000 male female respectively nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) . With early detection advance medical care , number NPC survivor post radiotherapy rapidly grow Hong Kong . One distressing consequence post radiotherapy NPC patient swallow disorder , dysphagia . Dysphagia NPC patient almost certainly cause frequent chest infection , dehydration , malnutrition limitation concurrent treatment oral medication . Given exist large cost NPC patient incur healthcare system , dysphagia serf inflate soar cost . In attempt reduce dysphagia relate cost healthcare system , swallow rehabilitation offer NPC patient . Currently , two major swallow rehabilitation approach commonly adopt . The first traditional rehabilitation , involve patient perform various oropharyngeal exercise aim improve swallow physiology . The swallow rehabilitation approach transcutaneous electrical stimulation , entail use small amount electric current increase muscle strength patient engage swallow activity . These two method proven effective patient stroke head neck carcinoma patient . Neither method , nevertheless , yield efficacy study treat NPC patient . Yet , clinician continue use either one rehabilitation method swallow rehabilitation . This study aim address gap efficacy study swallow rehabilitation NPC patient post radiotherapy . The research result provide justification rehabilitation time , clinician ' effort , cost involve resource use rehabilitate swallow difficulty NPC patient .</brief_summary>
