	<brief_summary>This study look healthy control patient Parkinson 's ( PD ) perform MR scan . 1 . The neurochemical profile SN patient PD measure high field MRS differ healthy control , glutathione low due oxidative stress , lactate high due mitochondrial dysfunction , gliosis marker myo-inositol glutamine high due inflammation ( glial activation ) N-acetylaspartate glutamate lower due neuronal loss/damage . 2 . There relationship neurochemical change disease severity .</brief_summary>
