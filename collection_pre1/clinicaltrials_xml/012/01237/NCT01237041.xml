	<brief_summary>Background : - Overweight obese child adult often low level growth hormone blood . Regulation growth hormone may tie weight free fatty acid blood . Current test growth hormone ( use evaluate height child markedly shorter child comparable age ) may affected factor , include obesity . Researchers interested evaluating level growth hormone free fatty acid blood child 7 14 year age weigh child comparable age , short child comparable age recommend growth hormone test part evaluation height . Objectives : - To determine effect change free fatty acid blood change growth hormone secretion overweight short child young adolescent . Eligibility : - Children adolescents 7 14 year age weigh short child comparable age medical illness . Design : - Participants two study visit , one half day screen visit outpatient clinic one require 2 night inpatient National Institutes Health Clinical Center . - Participants eat drink anything except water 10 PM night morning screen visit . - At screen visit , participant physical examination medical history , provide blood urine sample , oral glucose tolerance test ( check blood sugar level ) , x-ray leave hand check bone age . - The inpatient study visit involve physical examination medical history , full x-ray scan study body fat muscle , frequent blood test throughout visit , various medication stimulate growth hormone production low level free fatty acid blood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obese child adult display low spontaneous stimulate growth hormone ( GH ) secretion . It presume dysregulation factor normally involve control GH secretion underlies hyposomatotropinemia obesity , give GH production usually normalizes weight loss . Free fatty acid ( FFA ) one factor think involve regulation GH secretion . Niacin nicotinic acid derivative inhibits lipolysis lower circulate FFA concentration . Nicotinic acid derivative use several adult study examine GH secretion . Specifically obese adult , inhibition lipolysis find increase spontaneous stimulated GH production , presumably due direct effect FFA hypothalamic GH-regulating neuron . Thus far pediatric study examine effect niacin GH secretion , one small pediatric study normal weight prepubertal child grow 5th-10th percentile height test effect lipolytic inhibition acipimox ( related medication also derive nicotinic acid ) GH secretion . There data obese child demonstrate effect inhibition lipolysis GH secretion . We propose investigate one mechanism high adiposity alters GH secretion child test effect inhibit lipolysis . First conduct dose establish study determine appropriate dose niacin need suppress FFA concentration child . We conduct main study , design pilot randomize , double-blind placebo control trial niacin administration , assess effect stimulate GH secretion . We hypothesize overweight child niacin lead fall free fatty acid concentration consequently rise stimulate GH secretion . We hypothesize overweight subject demonstrate stimulate GH secretion profile niacin similar control subject receive placebo . We expect pilot study may help improve diagnostic test carried growth hormone deficiency child .</detailed_description>

Body mass index great eqaul 95th percentile determine Centers Disease Control age sex specific data ( give pathology obesity usually emerge child cross 95th percentile ) . 8 . No evidence growth failure define height &gt; 5th percentile . Subjects qualify nonoverweight control group ( main study ) meet follow criterion : 1 . Recommended pediatric endocrinologist undergo GH stimulation test establish diagnosis GHdeficiency . 2 . Good general health . 3 . Age great equal 7 less than15 year . 4 .

Height &lt; 5th percentile . 9 . BMI 5th 85th percentile determine Centers Disease Control age sex specific data . 10 . Birth weight length consistent small gestational age ( SGA ) criteria history intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) base recall history . EXCLUSION CRITERIA ( doseestablishing sutides 1 2 , main study ) : Subjects exclude follow : 1 . Baseline creatinine great equal 1.0 mg/dl . 2 . Significant cardiac pulmonary disease likely result hypoxia decrease perfusion . 3 . Hepatic disease elevate liver function test ( ALT AST ) great equal 1.5 upper limit normal . 4 . Pregnancy . 5 . Evidence impair glucose tolerance Type 2 diabetes , include fast plasma glucose great equal 100 mg/dL , 2 hour postdextrose glucose great equal 140 mg/dL , HgbA1C &gt; 6.4 % . 6 . Presence endocrinologic disorder lead obesity ( e.g . Cushing Syndrome ) . 7 . Any disorder know affect GH secretion ( e.g . untreated hypothyroidism ) use medication know affect GH level ( include glucocorticoid GH ) . 8 . Any disorder know affect stature include skeletal dysplasia . 9 . Recent use ( within two year ) anorexiant medication , stimulant medication , medication felt impact growth . 10 . Individuals , whose parent guardian , current substance abuse psychiatric disorder condition , opinion investigator , would impede competence compliance possibly hinder completion study . 11 .
