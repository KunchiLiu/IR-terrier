	<brief_summary>Background : - Olaparib experimental anti-cancer drug part class drug call PARP inhibitor . PARP protein involve repair DNA damage , may also encourage precancerous cell develop cancer cell . Olaparib give safely combination carboplatin , drug use treat breast , ovarian , uterine , cervical cancer , research need determine whether drug effective give together drug give first . Objectives : - To determine safety effectiveness combine carboplatin olaparib treatment gynecologic ( female organ ) breast cancer . Eligibility : - Women least 18 year age breast , ovarian , uterine , cervical cancer respond standard treatment . - Men least 18 year age metastatic breast cancer BRCA-1/2 mutation . Design : - Participants screen physical examination medical history , well blood tumor sample image study require researcher . Study participant divide two group . - Group 1 : Participants receive olaparib tablet twice day 7 day ( 14 dos ) receive carboplatin vein day 1 2 , 21-day treatment cycle . Group 1 study design determine safety new tablet formulation olaparib . - Group 2 : Participants divide two small group , reverse treatment schedule . Group 2 study design evaluate drug give first endpoint study blood sample . - Group 2A : Participants receive olaparib tablet twice day 7 day ( 14 dos ) carboplatin day 8 first cycle . Cycle 2 start carboplatin day 1 olaparib start day 2 7 day ( 14 dos ) . - Group 2B : Participants receive carboplatin first day first cycle , olaparib day 2 , twice day 7 day ( 14 dos ) first cycle . Cycle 2 start 7 day olaparib ( 14 dos ) carboplatin give day 8 . - From cycle 3 completion therapy , Group 2 participant follow schedule use Group 1 ( carboplatin day 1 2 week olaparib therapy , also 21-day cycle ) . - Additional blood tissue sample image study conduct throughout treatment period . - All participant may receive 8 cycle olaparib carboplatin therapy , may continue take olaparib cancer respond treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Olaparib Combination With Carboplatin Refractory Recurrent Women Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Olaparib ( AZD2281 ) oral PARP-1/2 inhibitor ( PARPi ) affect tumor impair repair single strand DNA cause double strand break . Carboplatin covalently crosslinks DNA cause stall replication fork repair nucleotide excision repair homologous recombination ( HR ) . - There publish data sequence-specificity PARPi platinum . Our preclinical data indicate sequence may important growth inhibition DNA damage repair . - We demonstrate activity safety concomitant administration olaparib carboplatin . - We hypothesize elucidation sequence specificity may improve upon clinical benefit optimize drug administration potentially safety . Objectives : - To determine safe dose olaparib tablet carboplatin . - To estimate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect two schedule olaparib carboplatin use peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) . - To determine schedule-associated safety olaparib carboplatin woman cancer . Eligibility : - Adult woman recurrent/refractory epithelial ovarian cancer , fallopian , primary peritoneal , uterine papillary serous cancer , malignant mixed mullerian tumor , recurrent/refractory breast cancer metastatic unresectable standard therapy exist longer effective . BRCA1/2 mutation carrier eligible metastatic disease . - Patients must prior chemotherapy , radiation therapy , hormonal therapy , biological therapy least 4 week . - ECOG performance status 0-2 adequate organ marrow function . Design : - A phase I 3 plus 3 safety run-in optimize tablet olaparib dose ( d1-7 ) combination carboplatin day 1 . The carboplatin dose trial AUC4 . - Subsequent accrual randomize patient one 2 schedule cycle 1 schedule cycle 2 . A : olaparib d1-7 &gt; carbo d8 ; B : carbo d1 &gt; olaparib d2-8 . - Cycle 3-8 schedule B . After 8 cycle carboplatin , olaparib administer alone daily basis . - Research sample obtain PD endpoint prior approximately 24 hour carboplatin infusion prior 1st 3rd olaparib . - Blood sample olaparib PK obtain patient first dose olaparib cycle 1 2 . - Patients evaluated toxicity clinic every 3 week every two cycle response use RECIST criterion . Imaging study obtain every 3 cycle patient stay study longer four year .</detailed_description>
