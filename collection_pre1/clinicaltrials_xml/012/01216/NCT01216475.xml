	<brief_summary>Background : Small Incision Lenticule Extraction SMILE novel form 'flapless ' corneal refractive surgery adapt Refractive Lenticule Extraction ( ReLEx ) . SMILE use one femtosecond laser complete refractive surgery , potentially reduce surgical time , side effect cost . If successful , SMILE could potentially replace current , widely practice Laser In-situ Keratomileusis LASIK . The aim study evaluate whether SMILE non-inferior LASIK term refractive outcome 3-months post-operatively . Methods/ Design : Single tertiary center , parallel group , single-blinded , paired-eye design , non-inferiority , randomize control trial . Participants eligible LASIK enrol study inform consent . Each participant randomize receive SMILE LASIK eye . Our primary hypothesis ( state null ) non-inferiority trial would SMILE differs LASIK adult ( &gt; 21 year old ) myopia ( &gt; -3.00D ) tertiary eye center term refractive predictability 3 month post-operatively . Our secondary hypothesis ( state null ) non-inferiority trial would SMILE differs LASIK adult ( &gt; 21 year old ) myopia ( &gt; -3.00D ) tertiary eye center term refractive outcome ( efficacy , safety , higher-order aberration ) 3 month post-operatively . Our primary outcome refractive predictability , one several standard refractive outcome , define proportion eye achieve postoperative spherical equivalent ( SE ) within Â±0.50 diopter ( D ) intend target . Randomization perform use random allocation sequence generate computer block restriction , implement conceal number-coded surgery within seal envelope procedure . In single-blinded trial , subject caregiver blind assign treatment eye . Discussion : This novel trial provide information whether SMILE comparable , superior , refractive outcome compare establish LASIK myopia , thus provide evidence translation clinical practice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Surgical correction refractive error may perform number procedure . Laser correction involve procedure EpiLASIK , LASIK conductive keratoplasty , lens base correction involve use phakic intra-ocular lens . Despite emergence procedure , due fast visual rehabilitation painless postoperative course , LASIK still procedure choice patient refractive surgeon . LASIK consist two step : first step involve formation corneal flap second one excimer ablation perform corneal stromal bed . Femtosecond laser ( FL ) widely use LASIK surgery fashion corneal flap . The laser cut lamellar follow vertical corneal incision . We able produce vertical cut since Femtosecond laser deliver laser pulse 1 micron diameter preselected depth cornea , expand 2 3 micron formation cavitation bubble . These pulse create micro-photodisruption corneal tissue formation expand bubble carbon dioxide water , turn cleaves tissue creates plane separation . The flap remove expose stroma refractive treatment do excimer laser denude stroma . The advantage femtosecond laser microkeratome LASIK flap reduce postoperative dry eye symptom , less chance dislocation trauma reduce incidence button hole free cap . Even though femto-LASIK demonstrate good efficacy , still asssociated side effect find standard LASIK e.g . glare , halo , dry eye still require use two laser machine , one flap excimer ablation . This increase length time overall procedure cost . Recently , new `` one laser '' refractive surgery propose : Femtosecond Lenticule Ex-traction ( FLEx ) . It consist perform entire refractive procedure without excimer laser . The Femtosecond laser create four stromal incision create corneal lenticule corneal flap . The size shape lenticule calculate base patient refractive error . The lenticule separate flap rest cornea use small spatula . Following , lenticule grasp forceps extract eye . Finally , flap reposition interface wash . At time refractive error already correct without use second laser . The advantage FLEx treatment shorten length refractive procedure , reduce patient inconvenience move one laser another , reduce risk intraoperative infection accurate ablation since patient need fixate . Currently publications compare FLEx LASIK , hence study unique fact pair eye approach act internal patient control assess objective subjective outcome patient follow procedure . The study prospective randomize trial patient compare SMILE ( variation FLEx ) LASIK treat myopic refractive error . One eye randomize SMILE eye LASIK . Each procedure perform sequentially . Randomization perform random number generator , assignment conceal envelope .</detailed_description>
