	<brief_title>Nicotine Treatment Impulsivity Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , group behavior change collectively call Impulse Control Disorders ( ICDs ) identify Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) . ICDs broad range possible symptom compulsive gambling , shopping , hypersexual behavior , overeat ; spend excessive amount time hobby , task , organize activity ; walk drive without goal purpose ; hoard overuse PD medication . It estimate many 30 % people PD experience ICDs course condition . ICDs believe occur due effect dopamine enhance medication area brain regulate behavior ( rather intend target area regulate movement ) . A reduction discontinuation PD medication helpful reduce ICDs . Unfortunately reduction medication often impractical possible people PD rely medication improve movement symptom . There currently scientifically proven treatment ICDs except PD medication reduction . Acetylcholine chemical brain work regulate effect dopamine . It know many year nicotine imitate many action acetylcholine . In preliminary study , nicotine show reduce impulsive behavior Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder . By administer nicotine across skin use patch , hope good understand whether nicotine may act improve impulse control disorder PD without need reduce stop PD medication . Several study show nicotine tolerate well people PD , appear worsen motor/movement symptom . The amount nicotine patch use study patch use people try quit smoking . In pilot within-subject crossover placebo-controlled study , subject diagnosis Parkinson 's Disease recently experience impulse control disorder enrol . Subjects randomize one two treatment group . During first portion study , first treatment group receive transdermal nicotine ( nicotine skin patch ) second treatment group receive identical placebo patch contain nicotine . Over course study , two group switch receive whichever treatment initially receive ( example-the first treatment group later receive placebo patch second treatment group later receive nicotine patch ) . Each treatment group receive nicotine patch placebo patch equal number week , different time study . Clinical laboratory computer base measurement impulsive compulsive behavior , memory testing , sleep quality/ sleepiness , Parkinson 's disease symptom assess visit .</detailed_description>
