	<brief_summary>Our propose study design test safety new vaccine melanoma . The induction immune activity cancer melanoma promise approach cancer treatment , date , clinically significant immune response see follow vaccine therapy . This important problem , since limit treatment option patient metastatic melanoma ( melanoma spread lymph node organ ) . Studies suggest monoclonal antibody ( mAbs ) block inhibitory receptor immune cell enhance immune response cancer , intravenous injection mAbs cause severe side effect animal human . In laboratory , develop method deliver mAbs proteins block inhibitory receptor locally site immune response melanoma protein stimulate vaccination , enhance anti-melanoma immunity avoid side-effects associate intravenous injection immune modulators . This achieve loading dendritic cell , type immune cell , RNA encode immune modulator . The RNA-loaded dendritic cell make immune modulatory protein release locally . By mix dendritic cell additional dendritic cell load melanoma protein , immune modulators release site anti-melanoma immune cell stimulate . In phase I trial , subject metastatic melanoma undergo process leukapheresis , white blood cell remove body . Monocytes , type immune cell , purify white blood cell culture condition change dendritic cell . Half dendritic cell load melanoma antigen RNA , lead production melanoma antigen protein within dendritic cell . The remain half dendritic cell either untreated loaded RNA encode immune modulators dendritic cell release immune modulators site vaccination . These dendritic cell mixed melanoma antigen-loaded dendritic cell inject vaccine lymph node . Each subject receive six weekly injection dendritic cell . Safety toxicity closely monitor . In addition , immune response melanoma , well clinical response , assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A variety trial immunotherapy metastatic melanoma clearly demonstrate immune response melanoma induce , patient respond clinically , suggest new strategy enhance anti-cancer immune response need . Most immunotherapy trial focus antigen delivery provide stimulatory antigen-specific signal T cell . However , induction antigen-specific T cell-mediated immune response regulate stimulatory signal , also inhibitory receptor-mediated signal . Studies demonstrate administer mAbs target immune-modulating receptor T cell enhance vaccine-induced anti-tumor immunity , suggest approach might improve efficacy clinical cancer vaccine . However , systemic administration mAbs associate severe , sometimes fatal , autoimmunity . We develop approach target delivery immune modulatory protein mAbs , use immune modulator RNA-transfected dendritic cell ( DC ) , sit anti-tumor T cell induce . Our preliminary study indicate approach may eliminate adverse effect associate systemic administration immune modulators , also enhance vaccine-induced immune response . Therefore , objective propose Phase I immunotherapy trial determine safety obtain preliminary data efficacy vaccination human subject melanoma tumor associate antigen ( TAA ) RNA-transfected mature monocyte-derived DC coadministered additional untransfected DC ( Study Arm A ) , DC transfected RNA encode soluble GITR-L fusion protein ( Study Arm B ) , DC transfected RNA encode humanize heavy light chain antagonistic anti-CTLA-4 mAb ( Study Arm C ) , DC transfected combined GITR-L anti-CTLA-4 mAb RNA ( Study Arm D ) . All study subject undergo leukapheresis collection peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) purify monocyte culture cytokine GM-CSF IL-4 produce immature DC . After induction maturation standard cytokine cocktail , half DC transfected RNA encode melanoma TAAs MART , tyrosinase , gp100 , MAGE-3 , remain half DC either untransfected ( Study Arm A ) transfected immune modulator RNA ( Study Arm B , C , D ) . DC cryopreserved . Subjects immunized DC , weekly six intranodal injection . For subject , safety toxicity assess , anti-tumor immune response measure .</detailed_description>
