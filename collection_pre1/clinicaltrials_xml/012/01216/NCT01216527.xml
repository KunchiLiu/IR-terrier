	<brief_title>Phase III Study Neo-adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Followed Surgery Squamous Cell Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal cancer ( EC ) eighth common cancer world , 480,000 new case 400,000 death occur annually worldwide . In China , every year , matter new case death account half world . Besides , 90 % Chinese patient esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) . Surgery main treatment disease , prognosis patient locally advanced esophageal cancer rather poor . As result surgery alone , 5-year survival rate 25 % change significantly several decade . Preoperative chemoradiotherapy follow surgery seem hopefully improve survival EC . Nevertheless , result different study inconsistent . Recently , CROSS trial demonstrate preoperative chemoradiotherapy significantly increase overall survival patient EC compare surgery alone . It notice 84 case ( 23 % ) ESCC enrol trial potential minimal follow-up 2 year , may perfect evaluate effect combine therapy tumor type . Up till , vinorelbine indication esophageal cancer , although , study report effect feasibility therapy EC . Vinorelbine similar mechanism paclitaxel docetaxel , recommend chemotherapy EC NCCN . They classify antimicrotubule agent , cause mitotic arrest eventual cell death inhibition microtubule dynamic . In comparison taxanes , vinorelbine obvious advantage cardiac toxicity . This beneficial prevent cardiac side effect chemoradiotherapy , especially middle low thoracic EC , account 70 % thoracic EC China . For group patient , radiotherapy hardly avoid cardiac toxicity . Based preliminary study , demonstrate validity safety vinorelbine cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy . We carry phased III clinical trial investigate effect multidisciplinary therapy overall survival patient locally advanced ESCC .</detailed_description>
