	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate molecular effect Notch signal inhibition use gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 ( RO4929097 ) patient resectable stage IIIB , IIIC , IV intact melanoma tumor neoadjuvant setting . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess indication clinical activity RO4929097 patient . II . Assess effect RO4929097 Akt-mediated downstream biomarkers melanoma tissue . III . Assess effect RO4929097 melanoma stem cell subpopulation . IV . Identify patient-specific micro-RNA signature may correlate response therapy , recurrence , overall survival . V. Determine clinical feasibility measure circulate melanoma tumor cell blood correlate level recurrence and/or survival . VI . Correlate shed collagen cryptic epitope serum urine tumor response risk recurrence . VII . Measure pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics RO4929097 patient . VIII . Evaluate impact RO4929097 serum marker angiogenesis . IX . Measure serum autoimmune biomarkers correlate clinical response outcome patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 ( RO4929097 ) daily day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Within 35-56 day completion therapy , patient stable responsive disease undergo surgery . Patients may continue RO4929097 28 day surgery absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo tumor tissue biopsy baseline completion study therapy 4E-BP1 Akt-mediated downstream biomarkers , stem cell subpopulation , patient-specific micro-RNA signature study IHC PCR assay . Blood urine sample also collect baseline periodically study pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study , circulate melanoma endothelial cell progenitor cell level , collagen cryptic epitope , serum marker angiogenesis , autoimmune biomarker analysis ELISA . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
