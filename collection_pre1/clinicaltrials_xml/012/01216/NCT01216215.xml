	<brief_summary>Research Problem Asthma one common chronic disease world affect approximately 300 million individual worldwide . It characterize airway inflammation bronchoconstriction lead airflow obstruction , however , trigger factor behind asthma development remain elucidated . Genetic risk factor suggest play central role asthma development . Twin study support strong genetic component asthma , especially childhood asthma , heritability estimate suggest 48-70 % asthma risk attribute genetic risk factor . Suggestive susceptibility gene identify European American population yet Middle East include Saudi Arabia . Identified gene whether polymorphic variant gene encode known pathophysiological molecule novel gene identify linkage genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) inconsistent different population thereby add need undertake genetic study different ethnic population different country . Here , investigator hypothesize polymorphic variation novel susceptibility gene form major risk factor asthma development , response treatment progression Saudi population strong diagnostic , prognostic therapeutic implication . Research Significance Since manifestation complex inflammatory disorder strong heritability complex involve genetic environmental interaction , ethnically distinct population must examine know whether gene-disease association exist population . The objective proposal discover novel asthma susceptibility gene Saudi population . A good understanding genetic mechanism asthma enhance knowledge pathophysiology . Asthmatic patient distinct genotype respond differently asthma medication . Therefore , improvement diagnostics pharmacogenetics may first clinical development extensive study . This embrace concept asthma subphenotypes stratify medicine intervention target individual best benefit minimal side effect . Physicians look asthmatic patient able provide well medical service tailor patient , well identify Saudi people high risk development asthma , especially severe form disease . Research Objectives The main objective proposal identify know novel asthma susceptibility gene Saudi population investigate interaction clinical , environmental , inflammatory factor contribute asthma pathophysiology . Research Methodology In proposal , investigator investigate genetic factor contribute asthma susceptibility determine Saudi population , presence single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) previously report linkage GWAS population . Whole genome DNA also scan novel SNPs select `` asthma gene '' use microarrays . This enable u identify new SNPs contribute risk asthma specifically Saudi population . In addition , investigator cross-reference genetic immunological parameter correspond clinical data order elucidate impact certain gene , product ( e.g . cytokine ) , clinical manifestation asthma .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects document clinical history asthma period least 6 month prior study entry ( minimum one clinic followup visit since initial diagnosis ) 2 . Willing provide write informed consent judgment investigator , individual able understand inform consent process . 3 . Subjects document clinical history ( precede 12 month ) airway reversibility least 12 % base Forced Expiratory Volume ( FEV1 ) , measure pre post inhalation Î²2 agonist ( 2 puff albuterol use measure dose inhaler spacer ) OR 4 . Individuals demonstrate airway 12 % reversibility recruitment test asthmatic symptom , prior history asthma asthma treatment plan , recruit affected individual opinion investigator individual truly asthmatic confounding factor could explain reversibility symptom . 7 . Individuals strong history asthma waning , current symptom may include study asthma well control use asthma medication . Principal investigator must verify know clinical history individual accepting asthmatic individual . 8 . Individuals positive history asthma asthma medication usage family history asthma consider inclusion case study family member recruit . 9 . Able perform Spirometry/FEV1 correctly ( 7years ) . 1 .
