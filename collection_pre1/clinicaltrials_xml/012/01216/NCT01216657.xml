	<brief_title>Trial Single Agent Sunitinib Patients With Chemo-refractory Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single agent 2-step phase 2 study one-year follow-up evaluate antitumor activity Sunitinib administer treatment cycle 6 week duration ( 4 week treatment 2 week rest ) patient chemo-refractory melanoma . If first step show sufficient efficacy tolerability study continue step 2 . Treatment continue 9 month disease progression intolerable adverse event occur . Subsequently patient follow 1 year . Tumor assessment perform baseline , end cycle 1,2,3 subsequently end every uneven cycle ( 5,7,9 , … ) . A total 40 patient enrolled trial .</detailed_description>
