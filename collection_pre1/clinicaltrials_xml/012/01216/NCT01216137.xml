	<brief_title>Effects Vestibular Rehabilitation MS-related Fatigue : Randomized Control Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator investigate effect vestibular exercise program design help people MS two common problem : fatigue difficulty balance stand walking . Our primary aim compare result person MS participate vestibular exercise ( Experimental group ) individual participate typical rehabilitation exercise program consist stretch endurance exercise ( Exercise Control group ) people receive exercise treatment ( Control group ) . The study 14-week randomize controlled trial . Thirty eighty participant follow four week randomly assign one three group . Each participant equal chance assign either Experimental group , Exercise Control group Control group . The Experimental group receive standardized vestibular exercise program include upright postural control ( balance ) eye movement exercise ( 6 one-hour session 6 week ) . The Exercise Control group receive endurance train use stationary bicycle leg stretch exercise ( 6 one-hour session 6 week ) . Both exercise group receive 5 minute fatigue management education . Measurements self-reported fatigue , dizziness depression , performance computerize , stand upright postural control test walking capacity test measure determine benefit intervention . Participants Control group exercise , however chose , receive treatment within clinical set upon completion participation study . The investigator hypothesize : 1 ) participant Experimental group would improve significantly fatigue balance ; 2 ) improvement find Experimental group would significantly great improvement Exercise Control group Control group . Results : Analyses occur : Baseline ; 10 week follow-up ( Baseline post-intervention ; 14 week follow-up ( post-intervention post-four week unsupervised follow-up .</detailed_description>

( 3 ) Utilization medication ( ) know possible side effect fatigue : skeletal muscle relaxant ( i.e . Baclofen , Zanaflex ) , Statin Drugs , pain medication ( i.e . Opioids , tricyclic antidepressant ( TCAs ) , antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) ( 4 ) Any possible cause fatigue : major sleep disorder , clinically diagnosed major depressive disorder , anemia , hypothyroidism , B12 deficiency , cancer ( 5 ) Other neurological disorder might contribute significant balance problem , include cerebral vascular accident , peripheral neuropathy ( separate MS diagnosis , diabetes mellitus ) , peripheral vestibular disorder ( unilateral/bilateral vestibular hypofunction : benign positional paroxysmal vertigo , Meniere 's disease , acoustic neuroma ) ( 6 ) Change MS specific medication ( disease modification ) last three month ( 7 ) Documented MSrelated exacerbation last six month ( 8 ) Any medical diagnosis condition consider absolute relative contraindication participate exercise test and/or result limitation participation active exercise program aerobic exercise program , recommend American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) ( 9 ) Participation exercise routine specifically design vestibular and/or aerobic exercise program within eight week prior study participation .</criteria>
