	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , bendamustine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . It yet know whether give bendamustine hydrochloride rituximab together alone effective give bendamustine hydrochloride rituximab together bortezomib lenalidomide treat follicular lymphoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study give bendamustine hydrochloride rituximab together without bortezomib follow rituximab without lenalidomide see well work treat patient high-risk stage II , stage III , stage IV follicular lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bendamustine Hydrochloride Rituximab With Without Bortezomib Followed Rituximab With Without Lenalidomide Treating Patients With High-Risk Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare complete remission rate patient high-risk follicular lymphoma receive induction therapy comprise bendamustine hydrochloride rituximab v without bortezomib . - To compare 1-year post-induction disease-free survival rate patient receive continuation therapy comprise rituximab v without lenalidomide . Secondary - To determine 3-year progression-free survival 5-year overall survival patient . - To evaluate patient-reported outcome baseline treatment determine difference symptom palliation , treatment-related symptom , overall health-related quality life . - To examine association baseline FLIPI information outcome patient . - To examine association baseline end-of-treatment patient comorbidities assess Cumulative Illness Rating Scale ( CIRS ) outcome . - To create image tissue bank include serial PET/CT scan , diagnostic paraffin-embedded tissue , germline DNA , serial blood bone marrow sample sufficient support propose future study tumor host characteristic may predict clinical outcome , include treatment arm effect , enhance exist prognostic index . ( exploratory ) OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord FLIPI-1score ( 1 2 v 3 v 4 5 ) GELF tumor burden ( low vs high ) . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 bendamustine hydrochloride IV 1 hour day 1 2 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 4 week completion induction therapy , patient receive rituximab IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 8 week 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 ; bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 ; bendamustine hydrochloride IV 1 hour day 1 4 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 4 week completion induction therapy , patient receive rituximab arm I . - Arm III : Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 bendamustine hydrochloride IV 1 hour day 1 2 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Immediately complete induction therapy , patient receive oral lenalidomide day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 4 week completion induction therapy , patient receive rituximab IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 8 week 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life ( include fatigue , neurotoxicity , anxiety , depression ) assess questionnaire baseline periodically study therapy . Blood , bone marrow , tissue sample may collect periodically correlative study repository . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 15 year .</detailed_description>
