	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate utility safety home management home oxygen therapy acute bronchiolitis . A matched case-control study , one hundred thirty five infant age less 12 month diagnose bronchiolitis hypoxia attend pediatric community clinic randomly assign receive oxygen without standard nebulized therapy . Nebulized treatment either 0.1 % epinephrine dilute bromhexine , 3 % hypertonic saline . Intermittent oxygen treatment administer 6 time daily 7 day . Primary outcome measure emergency department visits/hospitalization secondary outcome measure change Bronchiolitis Caregiver Diary Score .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bronchiolitis infection bronchiolar epithelium . It associate profound submucosal adventitial edema , increase secretion mucus , obstruct flow small airway , lead hyperinflation , atelectasis , wheeze . Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) responsible majority case .Bronchiolitis frequent low respiratory tract infection high morbidity , lead cause hospitalization young child . Studies develop country report incidence hospitalization 30 per 1000 child first year life annual mortality rate 1.82-2 per 100,000 live birth . The cost treatment $ 2.5 billion yearly . One group United States estimate annual hospital cost bronchiolitis $ 365- $ 691 million . Of child develop bronchiolitis first 2 year life , approximately 1 10 ( 3 % infant USA ) hospitalize furthermore , substantial proportion infant remain hospital receive oxygen hypoxia improve . The current hospital treatment acute viral bronchiolitis mainly supportive , consist supplemental oxygen , suction hydration . Airway edema slough respiratory epithelium cell cause mismatch ventilation perfusion subsequently reduction oxygenation ( PaO2 Spo2 ) . Emergency Department referral ( ED ) Hospital admission ( HA ) admission , increase secondary increase sensitivity pulse oximetry detection hypoxia ( compare clinical observation . The therapeutic role bronchodilator although questionable clinical importance commonly use A recent review report show short-term improvement clinical score , improvement oxygenation rate hospitalization . Neither systemic glucocorticoid antibiotic appear clinically significant effect disease course . Antiviral agent ( Ribavirin ) indicate child serious underlie disorder . Trials chest physiotherapy use vibration percussion technique fail reduce severity illness , length hospitalization , oxygen requirement , treatment nebulized furosemide , inhaled interferon alpha-2a ( Roferon A ) , rhDNase prove ineffective . Clinicians influence significantly decision Emergency Department referral hospitalization patient respiratory disease . We hypothesize add short term home intermittent oxygen therapy 7 day treatment modality reduce hypoxia Emergency Ward referral . The aim present study compare outcome combine treatment oxygen medical modality oxygen alone placebo child RSV bronchiolitis .</detailed_description>
