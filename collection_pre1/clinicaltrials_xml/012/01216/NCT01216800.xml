	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Giving radiation therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether intensity-modulated radiation therapy 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy effective decrease hearing loss patient undergoing radiation therapy parotid gland cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study intensity-modulated radiation therapy see well work compare 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy decrease hearing loss patient undergone surgery parotid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy 3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy Decreasing Hearing Loss Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Parotid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine potential cochlear-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) versus conventional radiotherapy comprise 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy reduce incidence sensory-neural hearing loss patient parotid tumor undergo radiotherapy parotid region . Secondary - To describe compare impact IMRT conventional radiotherapy physical , social emotional well-being include generic functional symptom aspect well disease-specific issue relevant audiometry . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord center radiotherapy dose . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm surgical resection . - Arm I ( cochlear-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy [ IMRT ] ) : Patients undergo cochlear-sparing IMRT use local planning system daily , 5 day per week , 6 week ( total 30 fraction ) total dose 60 Gy ( 65 Gy macroscopic residual disease ) . Patients may undergo elective neck irradiation uninvolved lymph node area daily , 5 day per week , 6 week . - Arm II ( conventional radiotherapy ) : Patients undergo conventional radiotherapy comprise 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy daily , 5 day per week , 6 week ( total 30 fraction ) total dose 60 Gy ( 65 Gy macroscopic residual disease ) . Patients may undergo elective neck irradiation uninvolved lymph node area daily , 5 day week , 5 week . Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaire ( EORTC QLQC30 v.3.0 , head neck module H &amp; N35 , modify version Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit profile ) baseline 6,12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month completion study therapy . Patients also undergo audiological vestibular assessment 6 12 month follow radiotherapy annually thereafter 5 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month annually thereafter 5 year ( annually recurrence least 10 year ) .
