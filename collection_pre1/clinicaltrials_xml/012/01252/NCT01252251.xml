	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm metastatic uveal melanoma . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; = 20 mm conventional technique &gt; = 10 mm spiral CT scan . Patients may number prior therapy , previously treat somatostatin analogue mTOR inhibitor . At least 3 week must elapse since last dose systemic therapy . At least 6 week must elapse last regimen include BCNU mitomycin C. At least 3 month must elapse last regimen include antiCTLA4 antibody . If last regimen include antiCTLA4 antibody , radiographic disease progression since therapy must document . Age &gt; = 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use RAD001 SOM230 patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric trial , applicable . Life expectancy great 3 month . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; = 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt; = 1,500/mcL platelet &gt; = 100,000/mcL hemoglobin &gt; = 9.0 g/dL require transfusion within past 2 week total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine clearance le 60 ml/min Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . INR ≤1.5 . ( Anticoagulation allow target INR ≤ 1.5 stable dose warfarin stable dose LMW heparin &gt; 2 week time study initiation ) . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day administration first study treatment . Women must lactate . Both men woman childbearing potential must advise importance use effective birth control measure course study . Oral , implantable , injectable contraceptive may affect cytochrome P450 interaction , therefore consider effective study . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Evidence disease progression , determine investigator . Patients may receive investigational agent . Uncontrolled brain leptomeningeal metastasis , include patient continue require glucocorticoid brain leptomeningeal metastasis . Treated brain metastasis must stable least 2 month . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition RAD001 SOM230 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection bleeding , severely impaired lung function , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study RAD001 SOM230 agents potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant , breastfeed discontinue . Patients presence active suspect acute chronic uncontrolled infection history immunocompromise , include positive HIV test result ( ELISA Western blot ) . The safety potentially immunosuppressive drug like everolimus proven patient HIV . HBV DNA HCV RNA PCR test require screening patient positive medical history base risk factor and/or confirmation prior HBV/HCV infection ( see Section 8.0 hepatitis B/C risk factor screen form . Baseline QTc &gt; 450 m . Patients risk factor torsades de pointes , include uncorrected hypokalemia , uncorrected hypomagnesemia , family history long QT syndrome , clinically significant/symptomatic bradycardia , highgrade AV block , autonomic neuropathy ( include cause diabetes Parkinson 's disease , uncontrolled hypothyroidism , cirrhosis , use concomitant medication know prolong QT interval . Patients history syncope , family history idiopathic sudden death , history sustain clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( NYHA Class III IV ) , unstable angina pectoris , sustain ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , advanced heart block , history acute myocardial infarction within six month precede enrollment . No concomitant anticancer chemotherapy systemic drug . Palliative radiation therapy allow long patient meet eligibility criterion . Refractory nausea vomiting , chronic gastrointestinal disease ( e.g . inflammatory bowel disease ) , significant bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption . Chronic treatment systemic steroid another immunosuppressive agent . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine study period within 1 week study entry . Close contact receive attenuated live vaccine avoid treatment RAD001 . Examples live vaccine include intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella TY21a typhoid vaccine . Patients prior concurrent malignancy except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , adequately treated situ cancer , cancer patient disease free five year . Patients fast plasma glucose &gt; 1.5 ULN . Note : At principle investigator 's discretion , noneligible patient rescreened adequate medical therapy institute . Patients symptomatic cholelithiasis . Patients history alcohol drug abuse 6 month period prior receive treatment pasireotide RAD001 . History liver disease , cirrhosis chronic active hepatitis B C. Presence Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HbsAg ) . Presence Hepatitis C antibody test ( antiHCV ) . History , current alcohol misuse/abuse within past 12 month . Known gallbladder bile duct disease , acute chronic pancreatitis .</criteria>
