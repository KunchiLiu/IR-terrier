	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize , open-label , multicenter , active-controlled Phase 3b study evaluate noninferiority emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( FTC/RPV/TDF ) single-tablet regimen ( STR ; also refer fixed-dose regimen fixed-dose tablet ) relative regimen consist ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor ( PI+RTV ) two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) virologically suppress , HIV-1 infect subject . The FTC/RPV/TDF STR could offer attractive treatment option patient wish simplify dose reduce pill burden improve tolerability treatment . Participants randomize 2 group , FTC/RPV/TDF STR group , participant switch treatment regimen start study , Stay Baseline Regimen ( SBR ) /Delayed Switch group , participant remain baseline regimen first 24 week study ( design provide initial active control ) , may switch FTC/RPV/TDF STR Week 24 visit . After 48-week study analysis period , participant may continue receive FTC/RPV/TDF STR per protocol switch commercially available source .</brief_summary>
