	<brief_title>Comparison Elective Lymph Node Treatment Versus Clinical Observation Absence Palpable Lymph Nodes High Risk Skin Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( SCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , non-blinded , control trial high risk head neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma compare specific outcomes two treatment arm . Subjects eligible patient send Zitelli &amp; Brodland PC Mohs micrographic surgery tumor meet high risk criterion . These patient clinically-negative lymph node exam either enter arm nodal observation arm elective management neck , currently standard protocol per UPMC ENT department . The patient observation arm evaluation treatment lymph node abnormality detect clinically . The primary endpoint disease-specific survival . Secondary endpoint include overall disease-free survival , complication , quality life measure arm .</detailed_description>
