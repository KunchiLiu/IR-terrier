	<brief_title>Two Weeks Low Molecular Weight Heparin Distal Vein Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 50 % symptomatic episode deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) confine calf vein ( distal DVT ) . The proportion distal DVT propagate proximal vein , increase risk pulmonary embolism , know . The best treatment isolate distal DVT therefore controversial option include treatment , follow-up scanning treatment patient thrombus propagate proximal vein , full anticoagulation period range 2 week 3 month . There good evidence 3-month thromboembolic risk patient negative CUS limit proximal vein low , order 1 % . Previous study demonstrate patient treat short period anticoagulation ( 4-6 week ) low risk develop recurrent DVT PE . In addition , specificity CUS distal DVT low proximal DVT , increase proportion false positive finding , make likely proportion patient diagnose distal DVT treat unnecessarily , attendant risk major fatal haemorrhage . The need anticoagulation patient distal DVT prevent recurrent DVT therefore uncertain , however survey current practice suggest patient condition currently receive antithrombotic therapy . The impact anticoagulation initial patient symptom , subsequent risk post-thrombotic syndrome also unclear , may possible alternative justification antithrombotic therapy . In proposed multicentre , prospective , cohort study , plan determine short duration anticoagulation ( minimum 2 week ) safe effective treatment isolate distal vein thrombosis .</detailed_description>
