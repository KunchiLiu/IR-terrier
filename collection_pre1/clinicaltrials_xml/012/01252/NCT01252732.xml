	<brief_title>Oritavancin Versus IV Vancomycin Treatment Patients With Acute Bacterial Skin Skin Structure Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , parallel , comparative efficacy safety study single-dose IV oritavancin/IV placebo versus IV vancomycin 7 10 day adult acute bacterial skin skin structure infection ( ABSSSI ) suspect proven cause Gram-positive pathogen . Approximately 960 patient randomize 100 center globally . In addition , study characterize PK PK/PD property single 1200 mg IV dose oritavancin evaluate potential health economic benefit offer dose strategy .</detailed_description>
