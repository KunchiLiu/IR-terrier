Documented clinical history ( minimum six month ) intermittent mild persistent asthma accord Global Initiative Asthma ( GINA , 2009 ) criterion require respond short act inhaled b2agonist ( SABA ) therapy . 3 . Using SABA alone , concurrent use antiinflammatory therapy , ( i.e . Singulair , ® theophylline inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) ) . The dose frequency antiinflammatory medication stable least four week prior screen visit . For subject currently take ICS , total daily dose exceed 1000µg budesonide equivalent steroid . 4 . A prebronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 60 % 90 % predict screening . 5 . Confirmed diagnosis asthma demonstrating : Reversibility airway obstruction ≥ 12 % increase FEV1 within 30 minute inhalation standard dose albuterol ( 2 puff , 180 µg ) deliver via pMDI . 6 . Nonsmokers exsmokers ( stop least 6month period prior screen visit ) . 1 . A change asthma mediation within previous four week screen visit . 2 . A lifethreatening asthma episode within last six month &gt; 2 within past year . A lifethreatening asthma episode define asthma exacerbation require hospitalization and/or associate hypercapnea , respiratory arrest , hypoxic seizure . 3 . If Investigator subinvestigator 's opinion , subject asthma severity severe participate study , would unable withhold asthma medication time outline well require use daily high dose ICS ( &gt; 1000µg budesonide equivalent ) . 4 . Use long act inhale b2agonist ( LABA ) , ipratropium bromide contain medication ( ie . Combivent ) Tiotropium therapy . 5 . Use oral , depot parental corticosteroid within four week screen visit . The use topical corticosteroid cream ( &lt; 1 % ) treat skin condition allow . 6 . History upper low respiratory tract infection require antibiotic ; emergency room treatment precede four week ; hospitalization previous three month ; history multiple hospital visit treatment respiratory disease . 7 . History immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction inhale b2agonists , lactose , milkprotein , excipients ( pMDI inhaler ) component formulation . 8 . Clinically significant history current evidence disease list . Clinically significant define disease opinion Investigator would put subject risk study participation . These include , limited : bronchiectasis , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , cystic fibrosis , emphysema , chronic bronchitis , significant lung disease hypertension , opinion Investigator , deem subject unfit enter study ; subject must persistent systolic pressure 145 mmHg diastolic pressure 85 mmHg unless Investigator confirm satisfactory age . arrhythmia , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , congenital heart disease significant cardiac disease diabetes mellitus require medication cirrhosis , alcoholism , biliary obstruction hepatic disease epilepsy , psychosis , conditions/diseases nervous system malignancy current past history glaucoma 9 .
