	<brief_summary>This study investigation effect commonly prescribe anti-hypertensive agent insulin sensitivity , diastolic function aortic compliance . The aim study follow : Specific Aim 1 : To determine insulin resistant , hypertensive subject renin inhibition 12 week modifies glucose homeostasis insulin sensitivity . To accomplish specific aim , use three approach : fast HOMA Index ; three hour glucose tolerance test . Only hypertensive subject insulin resistance , assess HOMA index enrol study . Insulin resistance assess basally twelve week treatment either calcium channel blocker placebo , calcium channel blocker renin inhibitor , calcium channel blocker renin inhibitor angiotensin receptor antagonist . Specific Aim 2 : To determine insulin resistant , hypertensive subject renin inhibition 12 week modify diastolic function aortic compliance response dietary sodium intake . The protocol subject use define Specific Aim 1 . Myocardial relaxation velocity ( tissue Doppler image mitral annulus ) aortic compliance ( characteristic aortic impedance ) measure baseline acute chronic renin inhibition : 1 . Acute effect renin inhibition : Hemodynamic measurement obtain high low dietary sodium intake condition ( ~1 week ) single dose renin inhibitor . 2 . Chronic effect renin inhibition : Hemodynamic measurement obtain baseline 12 week three drug treatment arm . The study last 12 week plan study 45 hypertensive adult next two year .</brief_summary>
