	<brief_title>Evaluation Role Prostaglandins Radiation-induced Mucositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral mucositis significant toxicity radiation therapy chemoradiation therapy head neck cancer patient . However mechanisms induce mucositis completely understood . Previous work evaluate mucositis bone marrow transplant patient suggest prostaglandin level may associate appearance mucositis . The present study measure level saliva prostaglandin PGE2 PGI2 , , immediately , several week radiotherapy head neck cancer . These salivary level correlate clinical observation mucositis patient report pain level . Improved understanding mechanism mucositis may lead development effective target agent prevent problem .</detailed_description>
