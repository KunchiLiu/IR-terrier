	<brief_summary>The primary objective demonstrate effect teriflunomide , comparison placebo , frequency Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) relapse patient relapse form MS treat Interferon-beta ( IFN-beta ) . The secondary objective : - Assess effect teriflunomide , comparison placebo , add IFN-beta : - Disease activity measure brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) - Disability progression - Burden disease disease progression measure brain MRI - Evaluate safety tolerability teriflunomide add IFN-beta therapy - Assess pharmacokinetics teriflunomide use addition baseline IFN-beta therapy - Assess association variation gene clinical outcome ( safety efficacy ) - Assess measure efficacy teriflunomide fatigue health-related quality life - Assess measure health economics ( hospitalization due relapse , include length stay admission intensive care unit )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study period per patient expect 56 160 week depend patient randomize include follow : - screening period 4 week , - treatment period expect 48 152 week , - 4-week post rapid elimination follow-up period . Patients continue treatment fixed common end date approximately 48 week randomization last patient . For patient complete treatment period , long term extension study approximately 1 year ( include teriflunomide alone ) initially plan propose .</detailed_description>
