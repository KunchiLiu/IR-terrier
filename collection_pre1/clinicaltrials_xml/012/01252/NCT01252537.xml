	<brief_summary>Background : Tuberculosis ( TB ) HIV lead cause disease death Subsaharan Africa . Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) dramatically improve prognosis HIV infection , TB still common complication HIV-infected subject . Management TB-HIV co-infection complex , regard diagnosis treatment . Since scaling-up ART require management patient primary health care , critical achieve good strategy TB-HIV co-infection peripheral level health care system endemic region . This include development new method assess severity HIV disease need start ART TB treatment population . Aims : To compare score system clinical sign immunosuppression CD4 cell count assess HIV disease severity indication ART initiation , correlate immunosuppression status treatment outcome . Workplan : CD4 cell level result clinical scoring compare 1100 patient TB , use HIV-negative subject TB treatment control . Inclusion close February 2012 , follow-up participant complete August 2012 . Plasma level immune activation inflammatory marker correlate degree immunosuppression . Significance : TB significant clinical challenge successful scaling-up ART Africa . In order improve management primary health care necessary find robust reliable technique determine disease severity identification patient need start ART TB treatment .

	<brief_title>Immunosuppression HIV-infected Patients With Tuberculosis Ethiopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) remain leading opportunistic infection cause death among HIV-infected subject resource-limited setting ( 1 ) . The management TB-HIV co-infection constitutes great challenge health care system . Often , HIV infection first detect patient diagnose active TB , many patient advanced immunosuppression ( 2 , 3 ) . However , TB also occur individual relatively well preserve CD4 cell count , especially area high TB endemicity ( 4 ) . In setting TB HIV infection common , high proportion patient need anti-TB treatment ( ATT ) antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) diagnosis . Combined ART ATT associate risk drug-drug interaction , overlap side effect , immune reconstitution disease poor adherence , least patient severe immunodeficiency , risk outweigh decreased mortality ( 5-7 ) . Although optimal time start ART patient receive ATT completely understand , CD4 cell count threshold currently often use guide clinicians start ART co-infected patient ( 8 ) . Briefly , initiation ART ATT indicate patient CD4 count low 350 cells/mm3 , whereas usually recommend defer ART patient without clinical sign immunodeficiency CD4 cell count high 350 cells/mm3 . In recently publish WHO document , initiation ART propose patient active TB , time ART remain uncertain , well need ART subject CD4 cell count exceed 350 cells/mm3 ( 9 ) . Studies aim define optimal time point ART initiation patient receive ATT ongoing , might lead revised recommendation regard co-administration therapy . The number HIV-infected subject initiate ART increase impressively recent year , especially Subsaharan Africa . Still , estimate less half patient need ART currently receive treatment ( 10 ) . In order improve access , necessary decentralize treatment integrate ART primary health care system . In setting , CD4 cell count analysis rarely available , patient usually manage health care worker limit knowledge experience HIV-TB co-infection . Finding simple alternative tool identify immunosuppressed patient circumstance could therefore lead significant improvement care . The investigator hypothesize structure score system base clinical symptom sign could use assess degree immunosuppression HIV-infected patient TB , thus help categorize patient determine ART initiated setting limit access laboratory resource . The principal aim project investigate clinical score correlate CD4 cell level specific CD4 cell cut-off point use identify patient fulfil criterion start ART ATT ( specifically thresholds 200 , 350 500 cells/mm3 ) , compare result score TB patient without HIV co-infection . The study also evaluate whether score result predict short term mortality treatment outcome . In addition , investigator aim investigate panel alternative immunological surrogate marker could use measure HIV-related immunosuppression patient co-infected TB . Work plan Methods : Patients diagnose active tuberculosis health care facility Oromia region , Ethiopia eligible inclusion . The study perform district hospital Bishofto 4 health centre provide integrate care TB HIV ( Adama , Welenchity , Mojo Dukam health centre ) . Approximately 1 112 patient include . In region , approximately 40 % patient newly diagnose TB HIV seropositive . Inclusion criterion : age 18 year , write informed consent participate , consent HIV testing , residence catchment area study site , previous treatment ART ( except treatment prevention mother-to-child transmission ) , diagnosis active TB ( either pulmonary extrapulmonary accord current national Ethiopian guideline base WHO definition ) . Patients receive ATT within precede 6 month receive ATT two week current episode TB include . The score system contain 15 item , include report symptom ( history dysphagia , fever diarrhoea &gt; 1 month 's duration ) clinical finding ( anaemia , low body mass index mid-upper arm circumference , oral candidiasis , oral hairy leukoplakia , gingivitis , dermatitis , Kaposi 's sarcoma , herpes zoster scar ) . Scoring performed time initiation ATT ( irrespective HIV status ) either trained nurse health officer . HIV test do time accord local routine . Blood CD4 cell count immunological marker obtain consent participant , irrespective HIV status ( total , 10 ml blood ) . During follow-up , score repeat study staff . CD4 cell count well haemoglobin measurement validation clinical evaluation anaemia score determine use local laboratory equipment already place study site . Plasma analyse immune activation marker store -80 ° C. Clinicians charge patient determine ART start follow exist national criterion ( base CD4 cell count WHO clinical stag ) . The result score investigation thus use determining time point start ART study . Follow : On initiation ATT HIV diagnosis , patient evaluate accord clinical score . Treatment outcome accord WHO ( cure , treatment completion , default , death , treatment failure ) assess patient . Defaulters trace ascertain rate mortality . All patient longitudinally follow repeated clinical scoring CD4 count two month TB treatment end TB treatment , record mortality , new AIDS-defining condition , paradoxical reaction occur ATT , start ART . Data analysis : Results score system correlate CD4 cell count . Specifically , score result compare recommended CD4 cell threshold ART start relation ATT , order investigate whether score cut-offs may define identify patient correctly . Results score HIV-negative TB patient use assess specific total result different included item HIV-related immunosuppression among co-infected individual . In addition , result score system compare clinician 's decision regard patient 's indication start ART . All data manage code study purpose . Immune activation marker ( neopterin C-reactive protein ) analyze completion patient inclusion reference laboratory Ethiopia . For statistical evaluation , logistic linear regression analysis separate item score system initially perform determine relative importance , existence interaction variable define relevant cut-offs continuous variable . Different model weigh separate score item evaluate assess positive negative predictive value respective outcome . For comparison inflammatory marker general population live geographical study area , demographic data , CD4 cell count plasma sample storage obtain 400 healthy adult Mojo health centre . These person recruit voluntary counsel test service , negative HIV test result clinical sign active TB . Persons comparison group provide write consent participation . Preliminary result public health significance 1112 TB patient include study ( 307 co-infected HIV ) . Inclusion new participant terminate February 2012 , continue follow-up end August 2012 . Analysis baseline data primary outcome complete result score system publish 2014 . Testing baseline sample inflammatory marker ( neopterin C-reactive protein ) complete November 2012 . No similar system study . It critical importance improve management patient co-infected TB HIV resource-limited country , especially settings access ART . Initiating ART ATT challenge exist condition Subsaharan Africa , majority patient diagnose treat . If clinical scoring system provide reasonably reliable substitute CD4 cell count estimate degree immunosuppression co-infected patient , use define cut-off point optimal time point initiation ART , could become robust simple tool use peripheral level health care system . This would help identify monitor immunosuppressed patient need start ART parallel ATT , could lead improved treatment outcome decrease mortality .
