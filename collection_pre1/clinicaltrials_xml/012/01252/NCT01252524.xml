	<brief_title>Effect Calcium Polycarbophil Type II Diabetes Mellitus Control : Randomized Double-blind Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There several publication medical literature link use various type fiber beneficial effect lipid panel , glycosylated hemoglobin A1c , weight , blood pressure , cardiovascular event patient type 2 diabetes mellitus risk diabetes1-5 . Most study utilize fiber source dietary food intake psyllium . However , diet modification psyllium intake difficult patient comply daily basis many patient continue follow intervention . Polycarbophil bulk form agent use similar indication psyllium treatment constipation irritable bowel syndrome . Because polycarbophil come oral tablet capsule , patient may adhere regular intake good compare psyllium . However , unknown whether polycarbophil similar beneficial property compare psyllium fiber type . Taking polycarbophil prior meal may improve diabetes control allow patient small meal decrease absorption rate carbohydrate intestine . The goal study determine whether take calcium polycarbophil ( also know over-the-counter FiberconTM ) regularly improve diabetes control . The propose study randomize , control , double-blinded trial involve adult patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . A total 50 patient randomize receive either calcium polycarbophil placebo Family Medicine Center East Carolina University follow 6 month . The primary outcome trial glycosylated hemoglobin A1c . Secondary outcome measure include weight , blood pressure , cholesterol level . Additional secondary outcome measure number dosage medication diabetes mellitus , hypertension , hyperlipidemia . The potential benefit study include improve control diabetes mellitus , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , reflect improved outcome mention . Because calcium polycarbophil ( FiberconTM ) commonly use over-the-counter fiber product constipation , dosage use study well within typical use recommend manufacturer , potential adverse effect product think identical described FiberconTM . Patients receive usual medical care primary physician regardless participation study . After randomization intervention control group , study team monitor outcome measure alter medical care patient receive . Study title : Effects calcium polycarbophil type II diabetes mellitus control : randomize double-blinded study . Patient population : East Carolina University Family Medicine Center ( ECU FMC ) outpatient clinic patient Age 18 Diagnosed type II diabetes mellitus ( DM ) least 24 month . At least 4 office visit within past 24 month DM follow ECU FMC Geriatrics Center . Hgb A1c within past six month 8 % 10 % . Exclusion criterion : Dementia diagnosis psychiatric diagnosis preclude patient able consent study him/herself . Already take fiber supplementation ( polycarbophil , psyllium , methylcellulose ) Severe problem previous use fiber supplementation ( i.e . fecal impaction ) Dysphagia swallow disorder ( unable swallow pill 8 oz water ) Pregnancy study period Consent : Will obtain patient study HIPAA . Study design : Randomize 50 patient intervention placebo : Intervention : 25 patient receive calcium polycarbophil 625mg po TID meal 8 oz glass water 6 month . Placebo control : 25 patient receive placebo po TID meal 8 oz glass water 6 month . Total 50 participant project follow power calculation : Assuming difference group HbA1c 0.5 % , standard deviation 0.5 , power 80 % alpha 0.05 , estimate 18 patient group ( n = 36 pt ) need detect difference . Assuming 25 % dropout rate , goal 25 patient group ( n=50 pt ) need . Patients , primary physician , researcher blind therapy versus placebo . Randomization perform ECU FM pharmacist open seal envelope indicate whether patient receive interventional medication placebo . The tablet dispense pharmacist without inform patient , physician , research team member group patient randomize . All patient continue usual DM care . The patient must follow 3 month 6 month . A research team member perform telephone follow 1 week , 1 month , 3 month adverse event compliance . The outcome analyze intention treat analysis analysis use patient compliant trial protocol . Primary outcome : HgbA1c time enrollment , 3 month , 6 month . Secondary outcome : Data gather time enrollment , 3 month , 6 month : Weight Blood Pressure Number dosage medication diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia Serum LDL , HDL , triglyceride , total cholesterol Patient compliance study medication Adverse event include GI discomfort , constipation , excessive flatulence , fecal impaction , diarrhea , nausea , vomit , hypoglycemia , etc . Potential adverse event : Side effect Polycarbophil ( MicroMedex 2.0 ) : Abdominal fullness , flatus , vomit , stomach cramp . Systemic adverse effect expect since calcium polycarbophil absorb</detailed_description>
