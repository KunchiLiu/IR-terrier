	<brief_summary>In study , 80 coronary artery disease patient successful coronary revascularisation ( CABG PCI ) include . Patients exclude case : congestive heart failure , ICD pacemaker , disability limit exercise participation . These patient attend phase 2-3 cardiac rehabilitation , complete 6 week rehabilitation . Next , subject randomly assign control group intervention group . Outcome parameter : physical activity , exercise capacity , blood glucose , insulin level lipid profile , body weight waist circumference , cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Hypothesis : telemonitoring physical activity increase physical activity , improve cardiovascular disease risk factor , CAD patient attend phase 2-3 cardiac rehabilitation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telemonitoring During Phase 2-3 Cardiac Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We include patient suffer acute coronary syndrome percutaneous coronary intervention coronary artery bypass graft perform . All patient access computer internet connection . Patients ( ) 80 year old , ( ii ) implantable cardioverter defibrillator pacemaker , ( iii ) suffer severe arrhythmia , ( iv ) persistent exertional ischaemia revascularization therapy , invite participate study . Patients severe heart failure ( NYHA class III IV ) , neurological orthopaedic disability limit capability exercise , also exclude . The study prospective randomize controlled trial , include 18-week intervention . All patient include week six conventional phase II cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) . During phase II conventional CR , patient ( intervention control group ) educate core component CR include healthy nutrition , risk factor management ( lipid , hypertension , weight , diabetes , smoke ) , psychosocial management physical activity counseling . During first six week intervention , patient intervention group continue exercise hospital 's rehabilitation centre use outpatient service , combination exercise training program telemonitoring support . Patients control group continue exercise hospital 's rehabilitation centre use out-patient service , without participate exercise training program telemonitoring support . Starting seventh week study period , patient intervention group finish phase II CR hospital 's rehabilitation centre continue exercise training program telemonitoring support ; patient control group finish phase II CR hospital 's rehabilitation centre . All patient underwent maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPET ) clinical examination ( determination waist circumference , blood pressure , body mass index ) randomization , also sixth 18th week Telerehab II study period . A fasting blood sample take patient first 18th week Telerehab II study period . The hypothesis telemonitoring physical activity increase physical activity , improve cardiovascular disease risk factor , CAD patient attend phase 2-3 cardiac rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
