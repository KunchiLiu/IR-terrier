	<brief_summary>The purpose research measure endotracheal tube cuff pressure patient endotracheally intubate emergently emergency department field prehospital personnel . Overinflation ETTc pressure associate injury , seek determine phenomenon excessively inflated ETTc detect endotracheally intubated patient ED . There experimental aspect study , descriptive . Measurement ETTc pressure already perform respiratory therapy/respiratory care . We simply seek ass measurement determine patient fact high ETTc pressure . If find patient ETTc high pressure , might allow emergency department staff prehospital personnel paramedic EMTs use information seek method endotracheal intubation improve patient intubate without excessive ETTc pressure . This pilot study . We conduct several vitro study , demonstrate paramedic , EMTs , emergency department physician practice endotracheal intubation method might result excessively inflated ETTc .</brief_summary>
