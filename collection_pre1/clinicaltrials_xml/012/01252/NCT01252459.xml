	<brief_title>Amino-acid PET Versus MRI Guided Re-irradiation Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The high sensitivity specificity amino-acids ( L- [ methyl-11C ] -methionine , MET O- ( 2- ( 1 ) -Fluoroethyl ) -L-tyrosine , FET ) positron emission tomography ( AA-PET ) diagnosis glioma comparison compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) demonstrate many study rationale use target volume delineation tumor . Several clinical trial demonstrate significant difference AA-PET standard MRI gross tumor volume ( GTV ) delineation treatment planning . A small prospective study patient recurrent high grade glioma treat stereotactic fractionate radiotherapy ( SFRT ) show significant improvement survival AA-PET single photon emission tomography ( AA-SPECT ) integrate target volume delineation , comparison patient treat use CT/MRI alone ( Grosu et al . 2005 ) . However , randomized study demonstrate impact AA-PET base irradiation treatment clinical follow-up comparison traditional MRI/CT base treatment . The goal study evaluate impact radiotherapy target volume delineation base AA-PET ( new strategy ) clinical outcome patient recurrent glioblastoma ( GBM ) compare target volume delineation base contrast enhance T1 weight MRI ( T1Gd-MRI ) ( traditional , establish strategy ) . Concerning therapeutic safety , topography recurrence outside primary target volume well localization necrosis re-irradiation determine . All side effect assess CTCAE version 4.0 safety analysis present bad grade acute late side effect treatment arm whole study period ( treatment follow ) . Patients ask complete quality life ( QoL ) questionnaire ( assessed E-ORTC QLQ-C15 PAL ) regular time interval . This first phase II randomize study evaluate impact molecular image outcome radiotherapy brain tumor patient . Another goal technical part study development standardize physical-technical methodology integration AA-PET imaging biomarkers tumor volume delineation radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
