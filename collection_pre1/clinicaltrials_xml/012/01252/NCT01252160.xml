	<detailed_description>The rationale current study evaluate safety repeat QUTENZA application , include effect QUTENZA sensory function subject diagnose different type Peripheral Neuropathic Pain ( PNP ) . In order adequately assess long-term safety QUTENZA well define patient population current study enroll minimum 100 patient HIV-Associated Neuropathy ( HIV-AN ) Postherpetic Neuralgia ( PHN ) .</detailed_description>
