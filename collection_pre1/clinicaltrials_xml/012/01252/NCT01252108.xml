	<brief_summary>Helicobacter pylori infection gastric epithelium common bacterial infection worldwide . Its global prevalence estimate 50 % , though burden fall disproportionately developing world , prevalence area 80 % . H. pylori infection generally acquire childhood , without specific antibiotic treatment persist life . The infection generally clinically asymptomatic childhood , even adulthood 80-90 % infected individual remain asymptomatic ( although may transmit bacteria ) . SQ109 new , small molecule antibiotic characteristic make particularly attractive evaluate H. pylorus . In brief , SQ109 orally bioavailable , acid-stable , vitro activity H. pylorus achieves high intracellular concentration ( may important effect bacterial eradication ) . Based antimicrobial activity clinical safety , SQ109 evaluate clinical trial ass safety antimicrobial activity adult infect H. pylorus . Data study help determine whether large safety efficacy study individual H. pylori-associated duodenal ulcer disease warrant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation SQ109 Plus PPI Urea Breath Test-Positive Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 30 Urea Breath Test ( UBT ) -Positive volunteer enrol . Each subject receive SQ109 150 mg bid PPI 300 mg qd mouth daily 14 consecutive day . Major Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Subject must 18 45 year age ( inclusive ) . 2 . Subject must 2 positive Urea Breath Tests ( UBT ) obtain screening , clinically significant disease ( i.e. , hematology , clinical chemistry urinalysis test must within study-defined range . Clinical test must perform within 14 day receive first dose study drug . 3 . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) must 18 33 kg/m2 inclusive . 4 . Subject must able give voluntary write informed consent study related procedure perform . Objectives : 1 . To determine safety tolerability SQ109 administer daily 14 consecutive day male female Urea Breath Test ( UBT ) -positive subject . 2 . To assess antimicrobial activity H. pylorus SQ109 administer daily 14 day UBT-positive subject . Design : Each subject undergo screen evaluation within 14 day study entry ( Day 1 ) baseline evaluation Day -14 Day -2 Day 1 ( 14 day prior first dose ) . On Day 1 ( first day dose ) , subject administer study drug undergo Day 1 procedure . Throughout 14 day treatment phase study subject assess daily adverse event ( AEs ) . Laboratory safety evaluation perform Day 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , Day 14 , Day 21 . On Days 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 14 , 21 , 28 subject UBT . On Follow-up Days 21 28 subject return study unit safety assessment . Outcome Measures : Safety tolerability evaluate review physical examination , neurological examination , vital sign assessment , 12-lead ECGs , routine clinical laboratory test ( include chemistry hematology data ) , AE assessment . Efficacy Outcome Measures consist serial UBT assessment evidence H. pylori gastrointestinal tract collect baseline , 14 day SQ109 administration , 14 day follow-up period .</detailed_description>
