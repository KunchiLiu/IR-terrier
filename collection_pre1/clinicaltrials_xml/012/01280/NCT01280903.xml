	<brief_title>Staying Active With Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 9 million Americans symptomatic osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee , chronic disease associate frequent joint pain , functional limitation , quadriceps weakness intrude upon everyday life . At least half OA knee diagnose hypertension high blood pressure ( HBP ) , one prevalent risk factor cardiovascular disease . Many individual OA knee unknowingly HBP remain untreated . Our work others suggest person OA knee experience reduction BP participate regular regimen physical activity . Even small decrease systolic diastolic BP find physical activity clinically significant , e.g. , 2 mm Hg decrease reduces risk stroke 14 % - 17 % , risk coronary heart disease reduce 6 % - 9 % . Yet , 15 % person OA 47 % HBP engage regular physical activity . The purpose study investigate individually deliver , home-based , 6-month modify Staying Active Arthritis ( STAR ) intervention , guide self-efficacy theory modify address comorbid HBP , affect low extremity exercise ( flexibility , strengthen , balance ) , fitness walking , functional status , BP , quadriceps strength , pain , fatigue , health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) convenience sample 224 adult age 50 year old OA knee HBP . Using randomize control , 2-group design , ( 1 ) hypothesize end 6-month intervention period 6 month intervention period end receive modify STAR intervention likely perform low extremity exercise , participate fitness walking , show improvement objective functional status , demonstrate reduction BP receive attention-control . Secondarily , ( 2 ) evaluate impact modify STAR intervention , compare attention-control , subjective functional status , quadriceps strength , pain , fatigue , HRQoL time point ; ( 3 ) explore impact modify STAR intervention , compare attention-control , self-efficacy outcome expectancy time point ; ( 4 ) explore relationship self-efficacy outcome expectancy ; ( 5 ) explore extent self-efficacy outcome expectancy mediate relationship modify STAR intervention performance low extremity exercise participation fitness walking . Data analyze use repeat measure model .</detailed_description>
