	<brief_summary>Nowadays incisional hernia primarily repair use prosthetic mesh . In Switzerland mesh mainly implant via open laparoscopic approach . The differential impact two type surgical technique recurrence rate investigate study . With multicenter cohort study outcomes laparoscopic open incisional hernia repair investigate prospectively . Hernia recurrence main outcome measure . Hypothesis : Laparoscopic incisional hernia repair associate low recurrence rate compare open incisional hernia repair .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Laparoscopic Open Incisional Hernia Repair : Multicenter Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Incisional hernia common long-term complication follow abdominal surgery estimate occur 11-23 % 1-3 . Incisional hernia repair open laparoscopic approach . For incisional hernia prosthetic mesh nowadays implant virtually open laparoscopic procedure . The use laparoscopy treatment incisional hernia first report 1993 LeBlanc Booth 4 . Short term follow-up study show laparoscopic surgery associate decrease postoperative pain , reduce risk surgical site infection due minimal tissue dissection , short length hospital stay shorter overall recovery period 5-9 . Important long- term outcome parameter recurrence rate chronic pain 10,11 . Recurrence incisional hernia repair varies widely range 1 % 35 % 1,3 . Morbid obesity , previous fail open repair , large defect size postoperative complication associate increase risk recurrence 12 . Heterogeneity hernia size follow-up complicate comparison recurrence rate different technique . On average , 74 % recurrence occur within first 3 year initial repair 13 . Series acceptable follow-up least 24 month report recurrence rate open laparoscopic repair approximately 10 % 1 . Currently , well design prospective study available compare incidence recurrence open laparoscopic incisional hernia repair . Such variability patient characteristic , surgical technique surgical skill likely confound prospective randomize trial . Consequently , cohort study perform allow surgeon perform technique familiar . The aim multicenter cohort study assess incidence recurrence 36 month open laparoscopic incisional hernia repair , perform swiss hospital . Objective All patient undergo elective incisional hernia repair meet inclusion criterion ( see ) eligible inclusion study . These patient inform detail study preoperatively . After patient agree enroll study sign write informed consent , he/she advise attend follow-up assessment accord study plan . Methods All patient undergo elective incisional hernia repair meet inclusion criterion ( see ) eligible inclusion study . These patient inform detail study preoperatively . After patient agree enroll study sign write informed consent , he/she advise attend follow-up assessment accord study plan .</detailed_description>
