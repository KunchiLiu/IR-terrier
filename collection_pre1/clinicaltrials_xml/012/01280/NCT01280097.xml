	<brief_title>Study Sleep Delirium Intensive Care Unit ( ICU )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delirium sleep disruption common intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Delirium state acute confusion , experience especially old adult admit hospital , potential adversely impact patient ' outcome . Of hospitalized patient , high rate delirium occur elderly patient ICU . Development ICU delirium associate longer ICU hospital length stay , significantly high risk functional decline , loss independent living , increased mortality . Previous study focus describe clinical manifestation , risk factor outcomes ICU delirium ; yet , contribution sleep timing , well quality quantity , development delirium , previously rigorously investigate . Sleep disturbance , include change sleep pattern architecture , decrease quality sleep commonly observe old subject . In ICU , environmental factor ( noise level continuous ambient light ) health care practice ( frequent performance medical procedure test ) contribute sleep disruption critically ill old patient . Additionally , many sedative analgesic agent potently suppress slow wave sleep . In preliminary data acquire ICU patient , investigator observe fragmented sleep prevalent due frequent arousal awakening , sleep architecture alter increase light sleep , decrease restorative slow wave sleep . Despite common occurrence ICU delirium sleep disruption , know whether sleep disruption increase risk develop delirium critically ill old patient . In exploratory study , investigator propose test hypothesis severity duration sleep disruption independent predictor onset duration ICU delirium cohort old ICU patient . The investigator measure sleep disruption use continuous process electroencephalography measure ICU delirium use well-validated reliable standardize instrument . Results study inform contribution sleep disruption development ICU delirium older critically ill patient .</detailed_description>
