	<brief_title>Labour Analgesia Movement Babies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate potential utility actigraphy , non-invasive mean measure individual 's movement , distinguish effect different type maternal labour analgesia baby birth . The study hypothesize actigraphic data use differentiate effect neonates different form maternal intrapartum analgesia . In particular , hypothesize infant mother receive intrapartum opioid analgesia demonstrate few movement infant mother receive epidural analgesia receive nothing . Whilst well know drug administer mother labour affect baby , mean assess effect complex unreliable . A objective mean assess baby birth require , actigraphy may represent useful technique . Actigraphy use baby study variety setting , include compare baby bear different delivery mode ( i.e . vaginal versus cesarean delivery ) different gestation ( i.e . term versus preterm ) , although none study consider maternal analgesia receive prior delivery possible influence baby ' movement birth . Other study look sleep parameter baby , particularly measure activity , show association later index psychomotor development . The objective study compare actigraph-derived movement data baby whose mother receive commonly use analgesic technique labour BC Women 's Hospital . This prospective observational study . Women assess eligibility study admission labour ward . As one inclusion criterion vaginal birth , woman consider eligible admission may become ineligible depend mode fo delivery . Information available woman assessment room consent specifically seek deliver deem eligible . We plan recruit baby mother receive analgesia one four category : analgesia nitrous oxide ; systemically administer opioid analgesia ; epidural analgesia intermediate total dose fentanyl ( &lt; 150mcg ) ; epidural analgesia high total dose fentanyl ( &gt; 150mcg ) . We recognize woman may receive several even different modality labour analgesia course delivery . In situation , calculate total dose fo opioid receive route convert fentanyl equivalent purpose analysis . Neonates woman agree participate fit actigraph remain place ( except removal bathing ) 24 hour , discharge hospital . Actigraphs small , light-weight , wrist-watch-sized monitor weight 16 gram . The actigraphs place neonate ' ankle , position report cause less disturbance . Parents participate neonate also instruct use fo daily dairy allow correlation actigraphic movement data event bath ( actigraph necessarily remove ) external source movement ( e.g . rock , breastfeed ) .</detailed_description>
