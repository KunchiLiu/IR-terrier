	<brief_summary>Medical management central hypothyroidism controversial due lack reference evaluation pituitary negative feedback . Therefore , titration medical treatment base T4 level , measure variable laboratory method . Patients central hypothyroidism usually concomitant deficiency pituitary hormone need replacement therapy steroid , testosterone growth hormone . This combine hormone deficiency make clinical laboratory evaluation challenge among patient . Symptomatically , central hypothyroidism relatively mild lack non-specific might overlook due hormonal deficiency . Replacement therapy central hypothyroidism titrate arbitrary target free T4 level 50th percentile normal . The goal study compare standard result well known measure method new method measure Ft4 use Liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry .</brief_summary>
