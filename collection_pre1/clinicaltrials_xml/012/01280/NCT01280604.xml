	<brief_title>Effect Fenofibrate Conversion Triglyceride Levels Patients Statin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Study subject receive fenofibrate 54mg maintain similar triglyceride level patient 160mg fenofibrate . The primary objective randomize trial measure impact convert patient statin therapy fenofibrate 160mg 54mg per day compare patient continue fenofibrate 160mg per day triglyceride . Secondary objective include evaluate effect dosage change low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , HDL , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , serum creatinine ( SCr ) , potential cost saving associate prescribe 54mg instead 160mg . Electronic medical record use identify subject gather data demographic , comorbid condition , concomitant lipid lower therapy . Subjects recruit enrollment via telephone principal investigator ( PI ) , co-principal investigator ( Co-PIs ) , provider referral eligibility screen approval primary care physician . Subjects must provide write informed consent Health Insurance Privacy Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) privacy rule authorization prior participation study . Subjects randomize either intervention arm ( conversion 54mg fenofibrate ) control arm ( remain 160mg fenofibrate ) . Subjects study arm fast lipid panel , ALT/AST , SCr evaluate baseline . All subject repeat lab approximately 8 week enrollment . All subject continue receive standard care base lipid value . The study period begin approximately October 29 , 2010 run June 30 , 2011 .</detailed_description>
