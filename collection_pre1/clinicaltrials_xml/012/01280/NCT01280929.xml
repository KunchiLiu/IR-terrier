	<brief_summary>The purpose trial evaluate safety compare efficacy intravitreous injection ranibizumab alone ( 0.5 mg ) , versus combination intravitreous injection ranibizumab ( 0.5 mg ) plus panretinal photocoagulation , versus panretinal photocoagulation alone regression retinal neovascularization eye high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Panretinal photocoagulation cause regression retinal neovascularization reduce risk severe vision loss people proliferative diabetic retinopathy . However , destructive treatment may associate side effect ( : pain , transient blurring , loss peripheral and/or night vision , increase risk macular edema central vision loss ) always efficient regression neovascularization . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) show play role retinal neovascularization retinal vascular leakage relate proliferative diabetic retinopathy diabetic macular edema . Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment hypothesize alternative adjunctive treatment management retinal neovascularization macular edema relate diabetic retinopathy . There report retinal traction detachment patient proliferative diabetic retinopathy fibrovascular proliferation ( although frequent ) . However , clinical experience , think risk detachment exist place fibrovascular proliferation retinal traction previous injection . We inject ranibizumab prior surgery patient severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy , submit later posterior vitrectomy , reduce neovascularization minimize risk intraoperatory hemorrhage cause manipulation fibrovascular membrane . In total , already inject submit surgery 15 eye mention condition , excellent result . The result first 10 eye present congress Portuguese Society Ophthalmology ( 2008 ) .</detailed_description>
