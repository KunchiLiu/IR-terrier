	<brief_summary>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death Taiwan . The carcinogen environment key role development lung cancer , one main resource tobacco . Activated carcinogen organism lead mutation crucial oncogene result tumor development . Genes Cytochrome P-450 family , GST ( glutathione S-transferase ) family , UGT ( UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase ) family , ERCC-1 ( excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency ) , ERCC-4 ERCC-5 , encode antioxidant enzyme involve DNA repair process production transcription factor . In recent year , many study show correlation gene susceptibility lung cancer . Each gene different role tumor development pathway . CYP , UGT , GST , NAT2 ( N-acetyltransferase 2 ) NQO1 ( NAD ( P ) H : quinono oxidoreductase 1 ) involve production antioxidant enzyme . The antioxidant enzyme detoxificate hydrogen peroxide defense oxidative stress . However , genetic polymorphism may influence function detoxification , cause increase susceptibility lung cancer . P53 MDM2 gene play important role production tumor-suppression protein regulation transcription factor , may regulate growth apoptosis cell cycle influence susceptibility lug cancer . The polymorphisms ERCC gene may cause damage DNA repair process might also cause increase lung cancer susceptibility . The overexpression epidermal growth factor receptor highly correlate increase risk non-small cell lung cancer . The overexpression may induce proliferation cancer cell inhibition apatosis . Therefore , recent year , EGFR widely study new target drug susceptibility lung cancer . In addition , genetic polymorphism drug metabolism channel proteins , like OCT2 ( organic cation transporter ) , ATP7A , ATP7B ABC ( ATP-binding cassette ) transporter may influence metabolism , efficacy toxicity drug .</brief_summary>
