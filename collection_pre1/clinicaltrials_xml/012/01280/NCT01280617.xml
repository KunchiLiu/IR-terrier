	<detailed_description>Detailed Study Design : This plan single center prospective randomize study evaluate safety efficacy low dose thymoglobulin induction agent renal transplant recipient . Inclusion criterion adult renal transplant recipient sensitize potential donor . The patient agree participate study randomly assign either thymoglobulin 1.25mg/kg x 3 dos 0.75mg/kg x 3 dos . There 86 seal envelope perform randomization process . 43 envelope 1.25mg/kg dose 43 envelope 0.75mg/kg dosing . The investigator sequentially choose sealed envelope time patient randomization process . All patient start standard immunosupression regimen prograf/cellcept fast steroid taper . Data obtain every patient one year post-transplant . The investigator obtain follow information time consent : 1 . Type renal transplant ( live vs cadaveric ) 2 . HLA match 3 . CMV status donor recipient 4 . EBV status donor recipient 5 . Creatinine prior transplantation 6 . Urinalysis time transplantation 7 . Primary renal disease 8 . Weight renal transplant 9 . BMI recipient donor 10 . Age donor recipient 11 . Sex donor recipient 12 . White blood cell count 13 . Hemoglobin 14 . Platelets 15 . History infection 16 . History malignancy During clinic visit investigator obtain follow information : 1 . Creatinine 2 . Urinalysis 3 . White blood cell count 4 . Hemoglobin 5 . Platelets 6 . Weight recipient 7 . Infections 8 . Malignancies 9 . Renal biopsy report biopsy perform In addition standard care laboratory , investigator ask patient give u 7 additional green tube , one purple tube two red tube draw time standard care laboratories pre-transplantation , 3 month post-transplant , 6 month post-transplant 12 month post-transplant . This tube use measure CD4 , CD8 , CD19 , CD20 , CD68 cell cell believe affected use thymoglobulin . If patient renal transplant biopsy time 12 month study , excess tissue may utilize stain special cell marker include CD4 , CD8 , CD19 , CD20 CD68 . Subject inclusion criterion : Potential adult renal transplant recipient Subject exclusion criterion : Sensitized renal transplant recipient Methods statistical analysis employ preparation report : The investigator plan study 1 control per experimental subject , accrual interval 24 time unit , additional follow-up accrual interval 12 time unit . In previous study median survival time control treatment 36 time unit . If true hazard ratio ( relative risk ) control subject relative experimental subject 5 , investigator need study 43 experimental subject 43 control subject able reject null hypothesis experimental control survival curve equal probability ( power ) .800 . The Type I error probability associate test null hypothesis 0.05 . T-tests use compare group . Thymoglobulin ( rabbit antithymocyte globulin ) FDA approve treatment acute cellular rejection . Nevertheless , least past 10 year medication utilized induction agent renal transplant recipient . This induction agent allow prednisone withdrawal renal transplant recipient . Prednisone withdrawal extremely important renal transplant recipient old protocol allow long term prednisone use compromise long term health renal transplant recipient . Not prednisone increase markedly risk development diabetes osteoporosis , also increase drastically risk fracture , common cause mortality long term prednisone renal transplant recipient .</detailed_description>
