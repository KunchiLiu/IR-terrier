	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop evaluate usefulness MRI use 129Xe gas regional assessment pulmonary function . Specifically , three form 129Xe MRI contrast investigator focus — 1 ) image 129Xe ventilation distribution , 2 ) image alveolar microstructure via 129Xe apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) , 3 ) image 129Xe dissolve pulmonary blood tissue upon inhalation . Such image 129Xe gas transfer expect uniquely sensitive pathology affect gas exchange ( fibrosis , emphysema , pulmonary hypertension ) provide new insight regard normal rest heterogeneity pulmonary gas exchange .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Non-invasive imaging pulmonary function expect provide critical insight need spur progress characterize treat chronic pulmonary disease . The current primary diagnostic measure pulmonary function test ( PFT ) , introduce mid-19th century , yet remain standard care today . PFTs advantage non-invasive widely available , suffer poor sensitivity high variability . Thus , PFTs ineffective assess therapeutic response disease progression reasonable time scale , give frequent heterogeneity disease lung 's compensatory mechanism . It long appreciate improve sensitivity require assess lung regionally . To end , method , compute tomography ( CT ) , provide insight lung structure , lung function must infer . However , great concern high radiation dose associate CT , preclude frequent longitudinal follow-up imaging . Alternatively , regional imaging ventilation perfusion possible use nuclear medicine technique planar scintigraphy , single photon compute tomography ( SPECT ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) . However , CT imaging , modality expose subject ionize radiation apply serially without compel clinical need . Moreover , nuclear image modality suffer poor spatial temporal resolution . The key role HP 129Xe MRI enable non-invasive high-resolution imaging aspect pulmonary structure function . We recently show HP 129Xe MRI visualize pulmonary ventilation high resolution , well ability show abnormalities alveolar microstructure associate emphysema phenotype COPD . We also demonstrate fundamentally new capability directly visualize uptake 129Xe pulmonary capillary blood tissue , provide even complete picture pulmonary function supply regional gas exchange information . Xenon noble gas chemically alter body . A small fraction inhale Xe absorb blood stream document anesthetic effect moderate concentration . The level gas use protocol within previously derive safe limit animal human . The stable isotope 129Xe hyperpolarized , mean enhance gross MRI signal factor ∼100,000 . Such signal enhancement make possible image inhale gas high spatial temporal resolution . Moreover , property 129Xe enable image acquire multiple form contrast include ventilation , lung microstructure , regional gas exchange . Because 129Xe MRI us ionize radiation , inhale gas contrast agent , potential use longitudinal study test effect therapy monitor progression disease noninvasively .</detailed_description>
