	<brief_summary>The purpose study find safety effectiveness two different dos study drug , sirolimus , administer intravitreally patient uveitis . The potential effectiveness sirolimus utilized control inflammation uveitis yet avoid potential complication usually associate systemic use drug immunomodulatory therapy . In study , investigator administer sirolimus inside eye ( intravitreally ) one two dos ( 440mcg/mcL 880mcg/mcL ) . Local administration sirolimus eye expect effect rest body . Therefore , may offer safe way current method use control inflammation cause non-infectious uveitis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Uveitis condition certain part eye become inflamed . The inflammation usually recurrent . If inflammation treat adequately , permanent damage eye vision may occur . The inflammation cause infectious non infectious cause . The current research do determine safety usefulness treatment non-infectious uveitis use different dos intravitreal injection drug call sirolimus . Current treatment option uveitis include oral corticosteroid drug weaken immune system body ( i.e. , immunosuppressant drug ) . Treatment use oral corticosteroid , especially long period , may cause many undesirable side effect complication high blood sugar , high blood pressure , bone weakness , obesity , stomach ulcer , abnormal hair growth , increase risk infection . In addition , case , disease control even high dose steroid . Injection steroid around inside eye use control uveitis . However , inflammation always respond kind treatment . The eye may develop high pressure cataract injection steroid eye around eye . On hand , despite potential effectiveness , treatment drug weaken immune system may cause severe side effect . Increased risk infection common side effect immunosuppressant drug . The immune system protect body infection . When immune system suppress , infection likely happen . Some infection potentially dangerous . Because immune system protect body form cancer , immunosuppressant drug also associate slightly increase risk cancer . For example , long-term use immunosuppressant drug may carry increase risk develop skin cancer result combination drug exposure sunlight . The immunosuppressive drug powerful cause serious side effect high blood pressure , kidney problem , liver problem . Some side effect may show year medicine use .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Males female great equal 12 year age . 2 . Able give inform consent attend study visit . 3 . Have diagnosis uveitis determine Investigator noninfectious base patient 's medical history , history present illness , ocular examination , review system , physical examination , pertinent laboratory evaluation . 4 . Meet follow criterion : Have active uveitis , define least 1+ Vitreous Haze and/or least 1+ Vitreous Cell Count ( SUN scale ) , : receiving treatment ; receiving : prednisone ≥ 10 mg/day ( equivalent dose another corticosteroid ) , least 1 systemic immunosuppressant corticosteroid , combination prednisone ≥ 10 mg/day ( equivalent dose another corticosteroid ) systemic immunosuppressant . Have inactive disease , define 0.5+ Vitreous Haze less 0.5+ less Vitreous Cell Count ( SUN scale ) , : receiving : prednisone &lt; 10 mg/day ( equivalent dose another corticosteroid ) , least 1 systemic immunosuppressant corticosteroid , combination prednisone &lt; 10 mg/day ( equivalent dose another corticosteroid ) systemic immunosuppressant . Have posterior , intermediate , panuveitis ; panuveitis , anterior component present , must less posterior component . Sufficient inflammation require systemic treatment , base Investigator 's decision , warrant intravitreal treatment . Bestcorrected ETDRS visual acuity 20/400 better ( approximately 20 letter ) study eye . Bestcorrected ETDRS visual acuity 20/400 good fellow eye ( approximately 20 letter ) . 1 . Patients bilateral uveitis receive systemic immunosuppressive therapy ( e.g. , methotrexate , cyclosporine , cyclophosphamide , chlorambucil , mycophenolate mofetil , tacrolimus , azathioprine ) prednisone corticosteroid treatment uveitis uveitis fellow eye , opinion Investigator , control standard local therapy alone ; 2 . Any significant ocular disease could compromise visual outcome study eye . 3 . Intravitreal injection ( include limit antivascular endothelial growth factor 60 day prior baseline ; 4 .
