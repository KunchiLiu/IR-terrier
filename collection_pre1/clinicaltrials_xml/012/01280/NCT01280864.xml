	<brief_summary>Hypotheses : 1 . The bidirectional signaling cortex , pelvic floor/gut derange patient IC IBS . Consequently , demonstrate hyperexcitability pelvic floor/brain axis evidence short latency increase amplitudes afferent anorectal-cortical evoked potential efferent cortically-induced ( magnetic ) anorectal motor evoke potential . 2 . Unlike patient IC alone , patient IBS also demonstrate anorectal visceral hypersensitivity anorectal sensory-motor dysfunction .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) Study Population Inclusion criterion : 1 . During previous year , patient must recurrent abdominal discomfort pain least 3 day per month last 3 month associate two follow symptom ( 6 ) : ) improvement defecation ; ii ) onset associate change frequency stool ; and/or iii ) onset associate change form ( appearance ) stool ( 83 ) ; 2 . No evidence structural disease ( exclude colonoscopy/ barium enema metabolic problem lab test ; 3 . On prospective symptom/stool diary [ Appendix 1 ] patient report ) presence abdominal pain/discomfort least 2 day per week ; ii ) hard lumpy stool &gt; 25 % loose watery stool &lt; 25 % bowel movement ( IBSC ) ; ( iii ) loose watery stool &gt; 25 % bowel movement hard stool &lt; 25 % BMs ( IBSD ) ; &gt; 25 % hard loose stool within one week ( IBSM ) ( 6 ) . 1 . Patients laxative abuse , anorexia nervosa , bulimia ; 2 . Patients take constipate drug , ( e.g . opioids ) , tricyclic ( increased seizure risk ) , serotonin modulators ( tegaserod ) , antispasmodic ( dicyclomine hyoscyamine ) , muscle relaxant ( e.g . cyclobenzaprine ) unless drug stop least 2 week enrollment ; 3 . Patients current history depression and/or take antidepressant ; 4 . Patients comorbid illness , severe cardiac disease , chronic renal failure previous gastrointestinal surgery except cholecystectomy appendectomy ; 5 . Patients neurologic disease ( e.g . head injury , epilepsy , multiple sclerosis , stroke , spinal cord injury ) brain disorder prone cause seizure ; 6 . Patients experience impaired cognizance ( mini mental score &lt; 15 ) and/or legally blind ; 7 . Women pregnant likely conceive ( woman potential pregnancy must use contraceptive measure include ) ; 8 . Patients ulcerative Crohns colitis ; 9 . Patients rectal prolapse , anal fissure , anal surgery inflame hemorrhoid . Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome ( IC/PBS ) Study Population IC/PBS patient meet three modify NIDDK criterion ( 84 ) IC/PBS describe urinary symptom assessment form ( Appendix 3 ) : 1 . Participants report occurrence bladder pain score &gt; 3 Likert scale 110 . 2 . Participants report presence increase urinary frequency score &gt; 3 Likert scale 1 10 . 3 . The bladder pain increase urinary frequency present least 6 week . We recognize NIDDK currently work recommend new diagnostic criterion interstitial cystitis . We adopt revise criterion commiserate new recommendation NIDDK study progress . 1 . History genitourinary tuberculosis , bladder cancer , high grade dysplasia , carcinoma situ , urethra , vaginal , cervical cancer . 2 . Previous treatment cytoxan cyclophosphamide ( report patient ) . 3 . Radiation cystitis ( report patient ) . 4 . Neurogenic bladder dysfunction ( e.g. , ) due spinal cord injury , stroke , Parkinson 's , MS , spina bifida , diabetic cystopathy ( report patient determine neurologic exam . 5 . Having augmentation cystoplasty ( report patient ) . 6 . Having undergone cystectomy , cystolysis , neuroectomy report patient . 7 . Having urethral stricture le 12 French ( reported patient ) . 8 . Urinalysis &gt; 10 white blood cell per highpowered field . 9 . A positive urine culture bacterial cystitis within past three month ( report ) positive dipstick leucocyte esterase nitrate urinary dipstick test time presentation . 10 . Symptoms vaginitis ( report patient ) . 11 . Active herpes presentation active herpes last three month ( report ) . 12 . Use antimicrobial past three month urinary tract infection ( report ) . 13 . Presence bladder , ureteral , urethral calculus ( report patient ) . 14 . Having undergone cystometrogram , bladder cystoscopy anesthesia bladder biopsy anesthesia urethral dilation within 6 week . 15 . Pregnancy . Additional Criteria recruitment : Patients assess sooner 6 week follow DMSO treatment hydrodistention treatment may influence inflammation . Subjects infectious illness within 2 week participation . As estrogen level think contribute IC symptom , symptom exacerbation report perimenstrually ( 85 ) , menstruate subject test midluteal portion menstrual cycle ( approx . day 714 ) control hormonal variability . We weigh issue exclude IC patient take pain psychotropic medication vs. include patient . Amitriptyline commonly use treatment pain IC IBS ; patient commonly take psychotropic drug , systemic antihistamine , drug pain . If exclude patient medication , would able recruit small unrepresentative sample healthy IC patient . If ask patient refrain use medication 2 week study , would subject undue pain hardship , might trigger exacerbation disease . However , use antihistamine affect measurement methylhistamine , use amitriptyline anti depressant produce general blunt HPA response stressful stimulus ( 86 , 87 ) well modulate neurobiologic response . We exclude subject antidepressant examine homogeneous population . To try obtain representative sample possible without confound result use follow strategy pilot study plan use strategy propose study . Subjects take systemic antihistamine could include take antihistamine within week study . Our preliminary data indicate significant difference ACTH cortisol response reactivity challenge among patient use vs. use amitriptyline psychotropic medication ( p 's = .45 .90 ) . Healthy Controls study population : Additionally , recruit 30 healthy control match patient group regard age , gender , hormonal status parity . Controls healthy woman history urological disease genitourinary symptom immunomodulatory disease rheumatoid arthritis , lupus , MS , chronic fatigue , fibromyalgia , diabetes , cancer , HIV , vestibulitis , allergy , chronic fungal infection , migraine , depression , chronic pain condition . Healthy control ask complete Mayo Health Screening survey use adjudicate health status . Healthy control NO med multivitamin , oral contraceptive , possibly low dose aspirin . They take antihypertensive , serotonin reuptake inhibitor , thyroid med medication .</criteria>
