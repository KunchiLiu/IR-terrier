	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well carboplatin paclitaxel without viral therapy work treat patient pancreatic cancer come back spread place body . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Viral therapy may able kill tumor cell without damage normal cell . It yet know whether carboplatin paclitaxel effective without viral therapy treat pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin Paclitaxel With Without Viral Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess improvement progression-free survival Reolysin ( wild-type reovirus ) , carboplatin , paclitaxel relative carboplatin paclitaxel alone patient recurrent metastatic pancreatic cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability Reolysin combination carboplatin paclitaxel versus without Reolysin patient recurrent metastatic pancreas cancer . II . To compare treatment group efficacy endpoint overall response rate overall survival . III . To define combination Reolysin carboplatin paclitaxel ( CP ) modulate factor regulate immunity reovirus persistence system circulation patient pancreatic cancer . IV . To prospectively establish validate relationship Ras mutation tumor sample response Reolysin . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 wild-type reovirus IV 60 minute day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel carboplatin Arm I . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression may crossover Arm I . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month every 2 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
