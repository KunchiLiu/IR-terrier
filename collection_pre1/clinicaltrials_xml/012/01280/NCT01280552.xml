	<brief_summary>This phase 2 , multicenter study determine safety efficacy ICT-107 treating type brain tumor call Glioblastoma Multiforme ( GBM ) . ICT-107 immunotherapy patient 's immune response stimulate kill tumor cell . Patients must newly diagnose GBM yet receive chemoradiation . Some patient 's white blood cell ( WBC ) remove cultured laboratory purify antigen , similar GBM cell . The patient 's WBC/DC expose tumor antigen give back patient vaccine several month . The goal ICT-107 vaccine stimulate patient 's immune response kill remain GBM tumor cell surgery chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study ICT-107 Immunotherapy Glioblastoma Multiforme ( GBM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose phase 2 study randomize , double blind , control study safety efficacy ICT-107 newly diagnose patient glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) follow resection chemoradiation . The phase 1 clinical trial demonstrate safety promise efficacy small , open-label study . The purpose study provide information large , control clinical trial . Patients must newly diagnose GBM yet receive chemoradiation . Patients tumor resection , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) tumor assessment prior enrollment study . Post surgical treatment consist 6 week chemotherapy ( TMZ ) radiation follow washout period . After Screening informed consent , patient undergo apheresis study site collection peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) . Apheresis product send central site monocyte purify cultured dendritic cell ( DC ) . DC pulse synthetic peptide correspond immunogenic epitope tumor antigen . The pulsed dendritic cell aliquoted frozen shipping back site . Patients autologous DCs reinfused intradermally . A control group receive unpulsed autologous DC . Patients randomize age 2:1 ratio ICT-107 control.Patients receive least four intradermal injection ICT-107 vaccine additional vaccine maintenance phase . The primary objective compare overall survival ( OS ) progression free survival ( PFS ) patient treat ICT-107 versus Control .</detailed_description>
