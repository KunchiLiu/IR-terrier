	<criteria>1 . Histologically confirm metastatic unresectable solid tumor malignancy incurable capecitabine clinically appropriate . 2 . Patient must ≥4 week administration last dose cancer therapy ( include radiation therapy , biologic therapy , hormonal therapy chemotherapy ) . Patients receive small molecule target therapy part first line treatment regimen must ≥4 week ≥5 half live administration last dose whichever shorter . The patient must recover come new chronic stable baseline treatmentrelated toxicity . 3 . Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 ( see Appendix A ) . 4 . Life expectancy ≥3 month . 5 . At least one unidimensional measurable lesion definable MRI CT scan . Disease must measurable per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 criterion ( see Section 9 ) . 6 . Normal bone marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1500/μL Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥9 g/dL Platelets ≥100,000/μL 7 . Adequate hepatic function define : AST ALT alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) must ≤3 x ULN , ≤5 x ULN patient liver metastasis Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x institutional ULN 8 . Renal function define : • Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN 24hour creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min 9 . Normal electrolyte define : Phosphorous ≥ LLN Magnesium ≥ LLN 10 . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test perform within 7 day prior start treatment . Women childbearing potential must use effective birth control measure treatment 6 month follow completion study treatment . If woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participate study , must agree inform treat physician immediately . 11 . Must ≥18 year age . 12 . Patients must accessible treatment followup . 13 . Patients must able understand investigational nature study give write informed consent prior study entry . 1 . Untreated CNS metastasis . Patients treat CNS metastasis may enrol , provide patient asymptomatic , patient require antiepileptic drug steroid treatment CNS metastases . 2 . Treatment therapeutic dos coumarintype anticoagulant ( maximum daily dose 1 mg allow port line patency permit ) . 3 . Impaired cardiac function one following : History ( family history ) long QT syndrome Mean QTc ≥450 msec baseline ECG History clinically manifest ischemic heart disease ( i.e . myocardial infarction and/or unstable angina ) ≤6 month prior study start History heart failure leave ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction ( LVEF ≤45 % ) MUGA ECHO Clinically significant ECG abnormality include 1 following : left bundle branch block ( LBBB ) , right bundle branch block ( RBBB ) leave anterior hemiblock ( LAHB ) . ST segment elevation depression &gt; 1mm , 2nd ( Mobitz II ) , 3rd degree AV block . History presence atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter ventricular arrhythmia include ventricular tachycardia Torsades de Pointes Other clinically significant heart disease ( e.g . congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , history labile hypertension , history poor compliance antihypertensive regimen ) Clinically significant rest bradycardia ( &lt; 50 beat per minute ) Patients currently receive treatment medication relative risk prolong QTcF interval induce Torsades de Pointes switch alternative drug discontinue prior commence AUY922 ( see Appendix D ) . Obligate use cardiac pacemaker 4 . Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease opinion Investigator may significantly alter absorption study drug ( e.g. , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled vomiting , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome ) . 5 . Patients know diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis C virus , acute chronic hepatitis B infection . 6 . Concurrent severe , intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 7 . Women pregnant ( positive pregnancy test ) lactating . 8 . Any condition would prevent patient comprehension nature , risk associate , study , inability comply study and/or followup procedure .</criteria>
