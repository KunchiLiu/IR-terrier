	<brief_title>FOLFOXIRI Plus Panitumumab Patients With Metastatic KRAS Wild-Type Colorectal Cancer With Liver Metastases Only</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Further data emerge show consistent lack efficacy use EGFR inhibitor panitumumab combination chemotherapy treatment patient KRAS mutant colorectal cancer . For patient liver-only metastatic colorectal cancer , improvement response rate newer chemotherapy regimen lead large percentage patient eligible surgical resection . Treatment FOLFOXIRI improve response rate compare FOLFIRI . Similarly , addition EGFR inhibitor improve response rate FOLFIRI patient wild-type KRAS . In trial , attempt maximize response rate surgical resection rate use FOLFOXIRI panitumumab .</detailed_description>
