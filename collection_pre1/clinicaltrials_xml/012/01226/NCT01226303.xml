	<detailed_description>This study open patient diagnosis acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) PCR positive PML-RARα transcript rarer retinoid sensitive subtypes ( i.e . NPM-RARalpha , NuMA-RARalpha ) less 21 year age ( AIEOP , see appendix A ) . APL rare disease national group recruit small number patient trial annually . Therefore international study expect recruit 60-70 patient per annum total 300 patient 5 year . The study aim limit use anthracyclines stratify treatment risk group : standard risk - WBC &lt; 10 x 109/l : high risk - WBC ≥10 x 109/l . All-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) include phase therapy intermediate dose Ara-C ( IDARAC ) give consolidation treatment . Following one induction course treatment standard risk patient 2 consolidation block whilst high risk patient 3 consolidation block . The PML-RARα transcript monitor throughout standard risk patient detectable minimal residual disease real time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RQ-PCR+ ) end second consolidation block receive third consolidation block identical high risk patient . Patients RQ-PCR+ PML-RARα completion third block consolidation therapy candidate refractory/relapse treatment , remain study . Refractory/relapsed patient remain RQ-PCR+ PML-RARα candidate allogeneic bone marrow transplantation ( allo-BMT ) , whilst become RQ-PCR- PML-RARα individualise treatment ongoing MRD monitoring . These study guideline intend describe collaborative international study APL child adolescent provide information procedure entry , treatment follow-up patient . It intend guideline use aide-memoir guide treatment patient . Every care take drafting , correction amendment may necessary . Before enter patient study , clinician must ensure study receive clearance Local Research Ethics Committee necessary body .</detailed_description>

Study entry wait diagnosis APL confirm molecularly cytogenetically Less 21 year age initial diagnosis ( AIEOP , see appendix A ) Considered suitable anthracyclinebased chemotherapy Written inform consent available Females childbearing age must negative pregnancy test subsequently must attempt avoid pregnancy Patients clinical diagnosis APL subsequently find PLZFRARα fusion lack PMLRARα , NPMRARα NuMARARα rearrangement withdrawn study treat alternative protocol . Refractory/relapsed APL ( guideline protocol subgroup intended patient treat initial diagnosis accord protocol ) Concurrent active malignancy Pregnant lactating Physician patient/guardian think intensive chemotherapy appropriate treatment option Patients receive alternative chemotherapy 7 day longer without ATRA reason ( either APL initially suspect ATRA available ) .</criteria>
