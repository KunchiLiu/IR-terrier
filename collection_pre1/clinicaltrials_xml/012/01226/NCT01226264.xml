	<brief_summary>Uterine cervical cancer second common female malignancy . Therapy monitor essential detect early recurrence . Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance image emerge MRI image technique potential value detection primary recurrent disease assessment response therapy . The purpose project evaluate predictive value DWI therapy prediction recurrence cervical uterine cancer . It consider whether DWI able provide early information response therapy . This could enable identification less- non-responsive tumor way therapy adapt soon possible . Hence investigator could offer patient efficient treatment scheme reduction toxicity relate treatment could establish .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients diagnose cervical uterine cancer , voluntary basis , enrol study . These patient either underwent curative chemoradiation ( mainly patient advanced stage cancer ) neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( predominantly patient early stage cancer ) undergo surgery . Patients known contraindication MRI ( cardiac pacemaker , cochlear implant , claustrophobic patient ) exclude study . And patient contraindication Gadoliniumbased contrast agent patient know restricted renal function ( GFR &lt; 30 ml/min ) .</criteria>
