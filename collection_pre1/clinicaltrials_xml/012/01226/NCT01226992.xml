	<brief_summary>Recurrent CDI grow problem treatment option provide last effect . Fecal transplantation show several case series successful control recurrent CDI . The current study non-blinded , randomize control trial compare fecal transplantation 6 week taper oral vancomycin treatment refractory CDI . Approximately 146 patient enrol one year . Participants study follow 120 day , give opportunity cross alternative intervention arm relapse symptom occur . The primary outcome measure recurrence toxin-confirmed CDI within 120 day start intervention . Secondary outcome include : early recurrence symptom within 14 day , relapse within 120 day ( strain C. difficile ) , attributable mortality , hospitalization serious adverse event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Vancomycin Followed Fecal Transplant Versus Tapering Oral Vancomycin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose trial single-centre , phase II/III , open , parallel-group , randomize control trial . To evaluable population 114 participant assume 20 % loss follow-up , approximately 146 patient randomize 1:1 ratio receive either approximately 2 week oral vancomycin follow single fecal transplant via enema ( hereon refer `` fecal transplant arm '' ) 6-week taper oral vancomycin ( hereon refer `` vancomycin taper arm '' ) . The 2 week vancomycin pre-treatment fecal transplant arm allow fecal transplant donor screen potentially transmissible infectious disease ( clinically blood stool test ) , order ensure appropriateness safety donation . If patient fail treatment follow-up period 120 day , offer opportunity cross alternate treatment arm . Those cross follow additional 120 day second intervention . Participants assess clinically recurrence CDI symptom adverse event follow time point intervention : 4 day , 7 day , 3 week , 6 week , 12 week 16 week . All recurrence CDI symptom investigate C. difficile laboratory test confirm etiology symptom . Analysis intention treat . An interim analysis may take place completion follow-up 30 patient . This interim analysis mean establish safety feasibility study , measure efficacy . Although formal sample size calculation assess safety procedure , sample size 70 participant , adverse event rate , example 2.5 % , detect probability 0.83 fecal transplantation group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Laboratory pathologyconfirmed diagnosis recurrent C. difficile infection ( CDI ) symptom within previous 60 day . Recurrent CDI define : &gt; /=2 episodes CDI . Eligible patient must least one treatment course oral vancomycin ( minimum 10 day 500 mg total daily oral vancomycin ) . Symptoms CDI include : Diarrhea ( see ) OR Abdominal pain AND abdominal distension/bloating AND fever , systemic illness reason symptom Diarrhea selfreported define : least 6 watery feces 36 hour OR 3 unformed feces 24 hour minimum 2 day OR 8 unformed feces 48 hour Age 18 year old Signed informed consent Able travel clinic followup visit and/or adhere study procedure Agrees abstain take probiotic supplementation medicinal reason duration study followup period . To clarify , dietary intake acceptable ( e.g . nonsupplemented yogurt ) . Planned participation another clinical trial Patients condition neutropenia , graft versus host disease severe immunocompromise , enemas contraindicate More one episode CDI severe rapid onset , result : intensive care unit admission Evidence active , severe colitis ( ie . ongoing diarrhea responsive oral vancomycin ; hemorrhagic colitis ) enema contraindicate ( note patient may eligible colitis control ) Unable tolerate fecal transplantation procedure reason Hypersensitivity intolerance oral vancomycin Patients underlie chronic gastrointestinal disease cause diarrhea , : Inflammatory bowel disease Short gut syndrome Severe motility disorder Severe diverticular disease Other chronic diarrhea NYD Unable record frequency bowel movement Receiving investigational medication Planned therapy next 120 day may cause diarrhea ( example : chemotherapy ) Planned surgery require perioperative antibiotic within 120 day Pregnancy Requires regular use medication affect bowel motility onset CDI ( example : metoclopramide , narcotic , loperamide ) Serious bleed disorder , anticoagulant use stop temporarily procedure ( consultation prescribe physician ) serious platelet disorder ( platelet count 50 ) . Any condition , opinion investigator , would pose health risk subject .</criteria>
