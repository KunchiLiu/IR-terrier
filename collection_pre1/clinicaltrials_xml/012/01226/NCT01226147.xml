	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Tamibarotene ( AM80 ) Lupus Nephritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tamibarotene synthetic retinoid presently approve Japan treatment APL , US , Europe China still development APL . Compared retinoid drug available , Tamibarotene high activity retinoid , also show high receptor selectivity towards Retinoic Acid Receptor ( RAR ) subtypes alfa beta , gamma . All trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) derivatives usually pan-agonists subtypes , often know irritation skin one major side effect due RAR gamma subtype . Moreover , unlike ATRA tamibarotene cause induction drug metabolism CRABP . Tamibarotene known moderate T1/T2 balance well Treg/Th17 balance bind RAR-alfa receptor , show efficacy various autoimmune inflammatory animal model . In preliminary clinical research , patient lupus nephritis prednisolone treatment sufficient enough treated oral administration ATRA show remarkable decrease protein urea ( ref . Kinoshita et al , Am.J.Kidney Dis. , 2009 Jul 21 ) . Based result , investigator plan study evaluate efficacy tamibarotene together safety patient lupus nephritis . Tamibarotene use clinically Japan since 2005 . It 's side effect know similar clinically used retinoids .</detailed_description>
