	<brief_title>Influenza Vaccine Challenge Study Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational influenza vaccine ( FLU-v ) contain multiple highly conserve T cell epitopes present influenza virus , identify reactive different human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) population ; thus make unlikely anybody vaccinated population would unable mount immune response least one epitope contain vaccine . In study 44 vaccinate FLU-v experimental vaccine placebo 1:1 ratio . Volunteers attend screen visit , vaccination visit , 10-11 day overnight stay quarantine facility , follow-up visit P1 clinic . Three week vaccinate FLU-v placebo , 30 volunteer take Quarantine Unit expose attenuate H3N2 study virus monitor study physician nurse 10-11 day period . The 14 volunteer hold reserve back-ups . If few 30 volunteer travel Quarantine Unit eligible expose study virus , volunteer keep reserve use . Following discharge Quarantine Unit , volunteer attend one study follow-up visit , 28 day exposure study virus . Assessments take place sample take volunteer .</detailed_description>
