	<brief_title>The Right Question Project-Mental Health : An Intervention Increase Engagement Retention Mental Health Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intervention one two Cambridge Health Alliance ( CHA ) project University Puerto Rico-Cambridge Health Alliance Research Center Excellence ( UPR-CHA RCE ) . The overall goal project evaluate intervention teach patient set skill need facilitate active patient role mental health encounter , emphasize patient 's decision-making process mental health treatment . The project also aim support collaborative provider-patient relationship order increase engagement retention , consequently , reduce service disparity . The intervention pilot-tested Right Question Project-Mental Health I ( RQP-MH I ) study ( Alegr√≠a , 2008 ) , conduct part UPR-CHA EXPORT Center September 2004 February 2006 . The first aim current project conduct multi-site randomize controlled trial test Patient Activation Self-Management ( PASM ) intervention , also call RQP-MH II , predominantly Latino mental health clinic . The investigator assess intervention 's impact engagement retention mental health care . The second aim explore racial/ethnic difference effect RQP-MH II intervention Latinos compare non-Latino white , little known impact patient race/ethnicity effectiveness patient activation intervention . The fourth aim explore role patient-provider communication therapeutic alliance mediator relationship patient activation engagement retention care . It expect increased patient-provider communication stronger therapeutic alliance result increase participation decision-making process . These potential change process care expect consequently increase patient engagement ( keep schedule appointment ) retention ( reduction premature unilateral termination ) mental health care . Data show patient may readily state concern medical visit ( Roter et al. , 1997 ; Korsch , Gozzi &amp; Francis , 1968 ) usually refrain engage information-seeking ( Beisdecker &amp; Beisdecker , 1990 ) . Minority patient even less likely white counterpart collaborative relationship provider ( Cooper-Patrick et al. , 1999 ) . This problematic situation particularly minority patient , Latinos , cherish maintaining warm personal connection provider ( American Medical Association , 1994 ) may worry bring question ask explanation might jeopardize relationship . Minority patient may inform diagnosis , prognosis , medication side effect ( Schaafsma , Raynor &amp; de Jong-van den Berg , 2003 ) consequently feel disappointed receive need information ( Levinson et al. , 1993 ) . They may therefore less compliant treatment ( Kalichman et al. , 1999 ) , likely drop care ( Takeuchi et al. , 1992 ) . Minority patient may less comprehensive understanding mental health care compare White patient ( Miranda Cooper , 2004 ) . As result , great risk assume provider 's decision reflect best interest ( Flynn et al. , 2004 ) . This exemplary Latinos hold traditional role expectation oppose active involvement clinical encounter prefer delegate decision care provider ( Levinson et al. , 2005 ; Xu , Borders &amp; Arif , 2003 ) . To contend difficulty communication , intervention focus provider training ( Post , Cegala &amp; Miser , 2002 ) , less attention teach patient effectively express concern question provider ( Andersen &amp; Sharpe , 1991 ; Roter , 1977 ) . Yet result assessment self-management chronic condition ( Hall , Roter &amp; Katz , 1988 ; Stewart et al. , 1993 ) indicate great patient activation self-management treatment augment satisfaction care ( Blanchard et al. , 1990 ) , improve health care process ( Rosenberg , Lussier &amp; Beaudoin , 1997 ; Epstein et al. , 1993 ) , ensure receipt guideline concordant treatment ( Clever et al. , 2006 ) , potentially enhance health outcome ( Kaplan , Greenfield &amp; Ware , 1989 ) . Most study patient activation self-management field mental health care conduct minority population low literacy language English . Most included mixed-methods ( qualitative quantitative ) evaluate effectiveness intervention , obtain cost information help evaluate whether change patient activation self-management , treatment engagement retention , could potentially produce saving treatment health care outcome . The propose project expect fill gap , assess effect patient activation self-management intervention use mixed-methods approach , three data collection period . The investigator hypothesize patient participate patient activation self-management intervention significantly likely engage remain mental health care , report significantly high activation self-management score compare control patient . Given relationship patient participation health outcome , increase Latino patient 's participation decision-making mechanism eliminate service disparity goal propose intervention .</detailed_description>
