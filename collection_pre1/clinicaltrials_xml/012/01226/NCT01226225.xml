	<brief_summary>Cardiac rehabilitation , include physical training , become accepted treatment follow myocardial infarction , coronary stent implantation coronary bypass operation . Besides modify patient ' risk profile future coronary problem , focus improve exercise capacity . The ability able perform high maximal level strong predictor outcome ( new cardiovascular event mortality ) . The main purpose study evaluate whether aerobic interval training outweighs classical moderate endurance training improve exercise capacity . During interval training , patient perform exercise high intensity , couple minute recover low intensity . Such interval repeat . Preliminary evidence small study suggest type training lead large increase exercise capacity , compare traditional endurance training moderate intensity . In addition , mechanism might explain improvement achieve , well safety impact quality life study .</brief_summary>
