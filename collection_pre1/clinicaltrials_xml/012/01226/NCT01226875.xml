	<detailed_description>Shock wave lithotripsy ( SWL ) safe non-invasive treatment kidney stone . The SWL machine currently use unique feature : focal zone energy SWL energy focus order break kidney stone vary size narrow ( small ) focal zone wide ( large ) focal zone . Previous lithotripters offer one focal size correspond narrow range . The objective study compare single-treatment success rate narrow wide focal zone shock wave lithotripsy renal stone 5 15 mm great diameter , maintain constant overall lithotripsy energy level . A wide focal zone may offer trade-off compare traditional narrow focal zone : since area treat large , likely stone receive adequate energy move patient breathe treatment , less energy per cubic inch deliver kidney around stone ( might lead low degree renal injury ) ; hand less energy per cubic inch also deliver stone , stone fragmentation might inferior narrow focal zone . Thus , study want determine whether significant difference stone fragmentation renal injury ( measure incidence post-treatment renal hematoma bruise , measure urinary marker indicate degree renal cellular damage ) . Aside random choice focal zone size , change standard care lithotripsy treatment . We predict narrow focal shock zone result superior stone fragmentation , high single-treatment stone free success rate . However , may identify slight increase incidence rate subcapsular renal hematoma renal damage , detect urinary marker .</detailed_description>
