	<brief_title>Interaction Between tropisétron / granisétron - paracétamol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although mechanism action paracetamol far elucidate , data literature suggest action would rather central , without exclude associate peripheral action . Thus , various study show paracetamol easily pass blood-brain barrier . After administration human systemically , paracetamol find cerebrospinal fluid . Various mechanism suggest central action . In 1992 , Vane Feirrera consider involvement cyclooxygenase plant , conclusion seem invalidated recent work showing , compare NSAIDs , acetaminophen weak inhibitor enzyme . Another hypothesized mechanism action acetaminophen involve central serotonergic system demonstrate reduction effect paracetamol lesion descend serotonergic pathway . The inhibition serotonin synthesis p-chlorophenylalanine reduce antinociceptive effect paracetamol hot plate test formalin test . In addition , paracetamol increase serotonin level cortex deck reduces number cortical 5-HT2 receptor , without change number 5-HT1A receptor . Work do animal laboratory show total inhibition analgesic effect paracetamol administer orally , intravenously intrathecally intrathecal administration tropisetron , 5 HT3 receptor antagonist . This suggest role 5-HT3 receptor mechanism action paracetamol , despite absence binding acetaminophen receptor . A clinical trial conduct laboratory 2004 24 healthy volunteer . In protocol , pain threshold measure use psychophysical test electrical nature , PainMatcher previously validate laboratory . This essay highlight pharmacodynamic interaction expect tropisetron , also granisetron . This difference preclinical clinical result study determine whether due difference mechanism analgesic action paracetamol human animal , result administration clinical dos granisetron lose specificity 5-HT3 receptor , animal study . This study thus complementary previous work help demonstrate , human , reversion analgesic effect acetaminophen tropisetron granisetron . This protocol base study interaction setron -paracetamol 4 different level plasma concentration , repeat test set interval , concentration setrons gradually ( half-life 8 10 ) single administration . In addition , interindividual variability effect paracetamol study , link certain genetic polymorphism report subject test .</detailed_description>
