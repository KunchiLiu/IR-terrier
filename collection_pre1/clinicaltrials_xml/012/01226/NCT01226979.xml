	<brief_summary>This research do see effective high-dose rate endorectal brachytherapy ( HDRBT ) treat cancer low part bowel ( rectum ) . In study want try decrease side effect shorten course radiation treatment patient cancer rectum use high-dose rate endorectal brachytherapy ( HDRBT ) . This different form radiation normally give . With HDRBT , radiation give applicator place bowel next tumor . The radiation direct tumor small area around .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study pilot study open patient clinical stage T2N1 T3N0-1 resectable rectal cancer . The investigational tool evaluate high-dose endorectal brachytherapy ( HDRBT ) FDA approve method administer endoluminal radiation low rectal cancer . This study assume rate pathological response HDRBT similar historical control ( conventional neoadjuvant chemoradiation ) . All patient receive postoperative standard 5-FU base chemotherapy ( discretion medical oncologist ) . The clinical response assess endoscopic/ultrasound , pelvic MRI FDG-PET/CT . In addition , tissue serum collect evaluate biological predictor response therapy . The endpoint study include adverse event ( gastrointestinal toxicity ) , quality life measure QLQ-C30 , tumor regression/response .</detailed_description>
