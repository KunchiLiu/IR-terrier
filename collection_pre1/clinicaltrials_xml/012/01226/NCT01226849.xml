	<brief_summary>Incorporation rituximab conventional chemotherapy ( R-CHOP ) revolutionalized frontline treatment diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , one commonest subtype lymphoma . Although majority patient cure , still remain substantial number patient ( 20-30 % ) relapse despite upfront R-CHOP therapy . Recent study inform rituximab era , ability salvage patient relapse DLBCL conventional salvage regimen like R-ICE R-DHAP significantly poor expect . For patient expose rituximab frontline , response rate conventional salvage chemotherapy mere 51 % ( Coral Study ) . This suggest relapse rituximab exposure severe , strongly imply presence rituximab-resistant disease additional selection aggressive subtypes DLBCL R-CHOP may significant impact . As R-CHOP currently frontline standard care , do augment current available salvage regimen response rate 51 % unacceptable . Incorporation agent target rituximab-resistance also aggressive subtype DLBCL ( ABC subtype ) prudent salvage regimen . Bortezomib , target novel agent potent anti-tumor effect . It also show clinically able overcome adverse risk confer ABC subtype DLBCL . In addition , preclinical study also demonstrate bortezomib may enhance biologic activity rituximab upregulation CD20 , target rituximab . The investigator hypothesize add bortezomib salvage regimen DLBCL efficacious . Increasing response rate allow eligible patient go autologous stem cell transplantation . The investigator intend test tolerability efficacy combination bortezomib R-ICE regimen , attempt correlate response histopathological gene expression study tumor specimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Of Adding Bortezomib R-ICE Chemotherapy To Treat Relapsed/ Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The commonly use regimen relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) R-ICE regime ( rituximab , ifosphamide , cisplatin etoposide ) . It previously report give overall response rate ( RR ) close 70 % , complete response rate 53 % . As DLBCL patient treat frontline R-CHOP regimen , validity RRs R-ICE need reevaluate . Results CORAL study , prospective randomize phase III trial compare R-DHAP vs R-ICE relapse DLBCL recently present . It show difference RR R-ICE R-DHAP . However , RR patient receive prior rituximab frontline set significantly low 51 % , compare rituximab-naïve patient 83 % . This suggest relapse rituximab exposure severe . In addition risk aggressive subtype DLBCL ( activate B-cell [ ABC ] ) may abrogate rituximab , presence rituximab-resistant disease also strongly implicate . As R-CHOP currently frontline standard care , do augment current available salvage regimen . Incorporation agent target activate B-cell ( ABC ) subtype rituximab-resistance prudent salvage regimen . Bortezomib , proteosome inhibitor impact many cellular process relevant pathogenesis DLBCL , include inhibition nuclear factor-kappa B. Preclinical study also demonstrate bortezomib displayed significant antitumor activity various lymphoma , particular ABC subtype DLBCL . It also capable enhance biologic activity rituximab upregulation CD20 preclinical study . Demonstration synergism 2 agent , part due dependence overlap pathway , suggest explored combination . On basis , investigator aim conduct pilot study add intravenous bortezomib R-ICE salvage regime adult patient relapsed/refractory DLBCL .</detailed_description>
