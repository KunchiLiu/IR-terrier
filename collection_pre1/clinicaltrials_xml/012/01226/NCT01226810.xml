	<detailed_description>Single-tracer , dual-phase Tc-MIBI parathyroid scintigraphy base differential washout rate tracer ( MIBI ) thyroid parathyroid tissue . A distinct focus increase MIBI uptake relative thyroid gland , either early late image , focal uptake mediastinum , consider positive abnormal parathyroid tissue . Tc99m-MIBI planar scintigraphy find play major role preoperative localization parathyroid adenoma ( PTA ) , sensitivity range 85 % 95 % specificity 99 % . Subsequently , use MIBI- Single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) significantly improve sensitivity test improve accuracy lesion localization . A limitation add SPECT component relate relatively long duration . The duration MIBI-SPECT acquisition neck mediastinal area may take 15-20 minute use standard nuclear medicine camera . Long acquisition time may lead patient discomfort movement result image degradation , artifact may lead overall decrease diagnostic accuracy . A reduced SPECT acquisition time without image quality degradation may decrease patient discomfort increase clinical throughput . An ultrafast solid state CZT camera ( GE Healthcare Discovery 570C ) currently use routine cardiac SPECT image achieve high quality cardiac study significantly short acquisition time . Present study evaluate potential use ultrafast camera patient clinically suspect PTA perform Tc-MIBI imaging .</detailed_description>
