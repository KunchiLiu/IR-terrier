	<detailed_description>Introduction : Non-neurogenic urinary urge incontinence ( UUI ) common quality life disorder become prevalent age . It describe condition cause people feel `` urgent '' need urinate due muscle spasm bladder . Factors infection , inflammation , stroke , dementia stimulate bladder create spasm cause urine loss . Overactive bladder refers symptom complex urinary frequency , urgency nocturia without incontinence . Overactive bladder disorder storage phase bladder affect approximately 16.9 % US woman , increase 31 % age 75 . Standard treatment UUI include behavior modification , pelvic floor exercise , anticholinergic medication , less commonly , sacral neuromodulation . Unfortunately anticholinergic therapy moderately effective cause bothersome side effect , particularly high dos . Sacral neuromodulation therapy currently unavailable Saskatchewan close treatment centre locate Calgary . Botulinum toxin A ( BTA Botox© ) may useful treatment patient respond standard therapy . Botulinum toxin A used study improve symptom neurogenic urinary incontinence , migraine follow spinal cord injury , variety lower urinary tract disorder . This product approve FDA treatment follow condition : two eye muscle disorder ( blepharospasm strabismus December 1989 ) , severe underarm sweating ( primary axillary hyperhydrosis ) , brow furrow frown line ( April 2002 ) cosmetic purpose ( July 2004 ) . For treatment UUI , BTA inject detrusor muscle bladder muscle bladder squeeze urine towards outlet . BTA use study improve symptom urinary incontinence variety low urinary tract disorder , however , treatment non-neurogenic urinary urge incontinence examine well-controlled study . Research Purpose Objectives : The primary purpose study determine efficacy BTA treatment non-neurogenic UUI . The secondary objective examine side effect associate BTA treatment impact treatment patient ' quality life . Research Methods : This study employ 12 month , double-blinded , randomize , partial cross-over design . The first 6 month study , subject randomize receive either detrusor injection BTA placebo injection . In remain six month , subject control group offer detrusor injection BTA . All 36 subject follow remain 6 month . Study Procedures Protocol Pre-injection Assessment : The pre-injection assessment stage include evaluation medical history physical exam . Previous therapy medication disclose physician . The investigator ensure subject meet inclusion criterion , urinalysis pregnancy test 50 year old . Day Procedure : On day surgery , study pharmacist randomize subject use random number table . The study doctor , nurse , subject blind treatment allocation . Ancef 1gm , case penicillin allergy , cipro 400 mg , give intravenous . A local anaesthetic instill end cystoscopy ( 40 ml 1 % lidocaine ) sedation provide require . Fifteen minute lapse begin procedure . Using 30 degree rigid scope minimally invasive cystoscopic technique , 10 injection 10 U/ml per injection ( altogether 100 U BTA ) inject bladder wall , spar trigone.3,4 Subjects assign placebo condition receive injection saline similar frequency BTA injection . Subjects observe 60 minute post procedure discharge home . This standard protocol BTA procedure perform outpatient basis RQHR . Catheter supply provide upon discharge . Follow-up Schedule : 1 . Four Six Weeks Post-Procedure : The primary secondary measure assess . 2 . Three Months post-procedure : The procedure repeat four-to-six week assessment . 3 . Six Months post-procedure : The four-to-six week assessment perform , symptom retention residual since last visit discuss . A cystoscopy perform study culture/urinalysis , measure desire capacity , show incontinence . Study allocation reveal six month , BTA injection offer subject receive placebo . 4 . Nine Months : The four-to-six week procedure repeat . 5 . Twelve Months : The four-to-six week procedure repeat . Potential Significance : Current anticholinergic therapy non neurogenic UUI limitation . In addition significant systemic side effect , study show 50 % patient improve anticholinergic therapy , improvement always involve continence . Thus , detrusor injection BTA may safe efficacious therapy patient fail standard therapy anticholinergic medication allow improve quality life .</detailed_description>
