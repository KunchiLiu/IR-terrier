	<brief_summary>The main purpose study evaluate safety tolerability CNTO 2476 administer subretinally ( beneath retina ) use iTrack Model 275 micro catheter patient visual acuity ( acuteness clearness vision ) impairment associate geographic atrophy ( GA : partial complete waste away retinal layer retina ) manifestation age-related macular degeneration ( AMD : medical condition usually affect old adult result loss vision center visual field [ macula ] damage retina ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Study CNTO 2476 Patients With Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study Phase 1/2a , multicenter , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , single dose , dose escalation , fellow-eye control study evaluate safety clinical response single , subretinal administration CNTO 2476 patient visual acuity impairment associate GA secondary AMD . The study consist screening ( 21 day prior treatment ) period , treatment ( Day 1 ) period follow period . The study conduct 2 portion : Phase 1 portion include dose escalation Phase 2 portion enroll additional patient randomize one 2 optimal dos select Phase 1 portion ( acceptable safety profile see Phase 1 ) . For Phase 1 , treatment eye eye bad visual acuity one chosen investigator , however , treatment eye visual acuity well 20/200 . For Phase 2a , treatment eye eye bad visual acuity , visual acuity well 20/80 . Approximately 30 patient participate Phase 1 dose escalation portion , 38 patient enrol Phase 2a portion ( 19 patient receive optimal dose level X Phase 1 19 receive optimal dose level Y Phase 1 ) . In Phase 1 portion , treatment assign 5 sequential cohort , 3 patient per cohort first 4 cohort 6 patient fifth cohort . Cohort A patient treat first , follow Cohort B patient . All patient give cohort must complete least 4 week post-treatment follow-up patient next cohort may treat . Follow-up include postoperative follow-up period 12 month ( Day 2 , Day 7 , Day 15 , Week 3 , Week 4 , Months 2 , 3 , 6 , 12 ) long-term safety follow-up period 4 year ( patient evaluate every 6 month safety assessment ) . Safety assessment include vital sign , AEs , concomitant medication routine 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . The anticipated study duration approximately 5 year ( 1 year 12-month postoperative follow-up period ; 4 year long-term safety follow-up period ) .</detailed_description>
