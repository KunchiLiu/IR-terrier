	<brief_summary>The aim randomize control trial compare efficacy extend high dose letrozole regimen ( 5 mg /day first 5 day cycle 2.5 mg/day subsequent 3 day ) short low dose letrozole regimen ( 2,5 mg/day cycle day 3 7 ) adjuvant GnRH antagonist protocol management patient poor ovarian response undergo IVF-ET .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Poor response control ovarian stimulation ( COH ) estimate occur 9-24 % IVF cycle . Although consensus definition poor response COH , inability produce adequate number mature follicle ( ≤ 2-5 ) recruit adequate number oocyte ( ≤ 3 oocyte ) response standard stimulation protocol main criterion use diagnosis poor responder . Patients poor response COH usually high cyclical cancelation rate , poor embryo quality less number embryos suitable transfer cryopreservation . During past decade gonadotropin release hormone antagonist ( GnRHant ) widely use treatment patient poor response standard gonadotropin release hormone agonist ( GnRHa ) protocols .In contrast GnRHa , GnRHant administer late follicular phase therefore n't suppress early follicular phase endogenous gonadotropin suppressive effect ovarian function stage follicular recruitment.Several study compare GnRHant protocol standard GnRHa long protocol reveal reduction duration stimulation , dose required gonadotropin , cost IVF cycle GnRHant well equivalent pregnancy rate . In 2001 , Mitwally Casper introduce letrozole ( third generation non steroidal aromatase inhibitor license treatment hormonally-responsive breast cancer surgery ) new ovulation induction agent clomiphene citrate resistant patient polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) . Subsequent study confirm effectiveness letrozole induction ovulation woman PCOS superovulation ( either alone combination gonadotropin ) . In patient poor response undergo IVF , several study reveal combination letrozole ( 2.5 mg 5 mg/day 5 consecutive day early follicular phase ) GnRHant protocol improve ovarian response reduce gonadotrophin dose require . On hand , Schoolcraft et al report letrozole ( 2.5 mg/day cycle day 3 7 ) /GnRHant protocol advantage microdose flare GnRHa protocol . The ideal dose duration letrozole administration ovulation superovulation still clear . Several study compare two dos letrozole ( 2.5 mg 5 mg ) superovulation suggest high dose might associate follicle develop . In almost study date , letrozole administer five consecutive day early follicular phase . In one study , letrozole ( 2.5 mg/day ) administer ten consecutive day start day 1 menstrual cycle . In study , prolonged administration letrozole produce mature follicle pregnancy short letrozole therapy regimen patient clomiphene citrate resistant polycystic ovary syndrome . The investigator design randomize control trial compare efficacy extend high dose letrozole regimen ( 5 mg /day first 5 day cycle 2.5 mg/day subsequent 3 day ) conventional short low dose letrozole regimen ( 2,5 mg/day cycle day 3 7 ) adjuvant GnRHant protocol management patient poor ovarian response undergo IVF-ET .</detailed_description>
