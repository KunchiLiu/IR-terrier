	<brief_title>Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia ( PanIN ) Association With Recurrence Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer fifth lead cause cancer-related death United States . In order improve outcomes disease , significant research effort focus understanding change occur pancreas prior tumor occurrence . The type change often associate tumor name pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( PanIN ) . It yet clear identify PanIN lesion likely develop cancer length time require progression . In order evaluate question , interested examine microscopic genetic characteristic PanIN lesion two `` high-risk '' patient : 1 ) patient underwent surgery pancreatic cancer develop tumor recurrence surgery 2 ) patient strong family history pancreatic cancer genetic syndrome put risk pancreas cancer . The surgical specimen patient evaluate pathologist evidence widespread PanIN lesion . In addition , PanIN lesion test abnormality several major gene know important pancreatic cancer .</detailed_description>
