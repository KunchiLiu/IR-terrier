	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Laboratory-treated T cell may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Vaccines make HER2 peptide may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell express HER2 . Giving laboratory-treated T cell cyclophosphamide vaccine therapy may effective treatment breast cancer . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific T cell give together cyclophosphamide vaccine therapy treat patient HER2-positive stage IV breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ex Vivo-Expanded HER2-Specific T Cells Cyclophosphamide After Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With HER2-Positive Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate feasibility expand HER-2-specific effector T cell ( TE ) ex vivo CD62L+ TCM CD62L- TEM patient immunize HER-2 peptide vaccine . II . To evaluate safety infuse autologous ex vivo expand HER-2-specific T cell patient advance HER-2+ breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate persistence , function , phenotype adoptively transfer HER-2-specific TE cell derive TCM TEM precursor . II . To investigate potential anti-tumor effect therapy ex vivo expand HER-2-specific T cell patient advance HER-2+ breast cancer . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific T cell . VACCINE THERAPY : Patients receive HER2 peptide vaccine intradermally weekly 3 week . CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV day -1 . IMMUNOTHERAPY : Patients receive ex vivo-expanded HER2 specific T-cell IV 30 minute day 1 , 10 , 20 . After completion study treatment , patient follow day 28 , 35 , 49 , 63 monthly thereafter 1 year .</detailed_description>
