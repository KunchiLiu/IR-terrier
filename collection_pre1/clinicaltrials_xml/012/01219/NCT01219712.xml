	<brief_summary>Elderly patient undergo surgery proximal hip fracture high risk morbidity mortality ( M &amp; M ) postoperatively . Several study include investigator department show high risk cardiovascular complication group patient 3-month mortality 15-20 % . One cause high M &amp; M high incidence cardiac failure associate increase NT-proBNP group patient . The aim present study evaluate whether optimization preoperative cardiac function reduce cardiac M &amp; M postoperatively . Following verbal consent , patient increase NT-proBNP would randomize goal-directed preoperative optimization standard management accord current hospital routine . Following optimization , patient would transfer operating room subsequent management include perioperative patient management would leave discretion specialist anesthesiologist directly involve patient care . Postoperatively , Troponin T NT-proBNP would measure patient accord study protocol . In addition , major adverse cardiac event would document follow-up would do 30 day 3 month postoperatively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimization Study Cardiac Risk Patients With Hip Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open , randomize , multi-center study . Primary screening patient would take place Emergency room Orthopedic ward accord inclusion exclusion criterion ( see ) . All patient ( &gt; = 65 yr ) proximal hip fracture would require provide either write verbal inform consent prior include study . Subsequently , NT-proBNP would take recommended level suggest cardiac failure ( &gt; 900 ng/l patient 65-75 yrs old , &gt; 1800 ng/l patient &gt; 75 yr ) , patient may include study . Included patient would randomize two group : Standard management accord exist hospital routine Optimized Management Patients normal NT-proBNP would list would include study . Patients proximal femur fracture &gt; 65 yrs old increase NT-proBNP give informed consent would randomize either Standard Management Optimized Management . The former group would manage accord hospital routine care Specialist Anaesthesiologist Orthopaedic surgeon preoperatively . Group O= Optimization Patients randomized Optimization group would transfer Holding Area , close Operating Rooms 4-6 hour prior plan surgery . The main aim optimization achieve normal oxygen delivery tissue preoperatively i.e . DO2 : 500-600ml/min/m2 . Optimized management mean patient first Echocardiography evaluate myocardial function . Subsequently , arterial line insert optimization achieve use arterial line connect Flo-track system ( Vigileo , Edwards ) . The system use pulse wave analysis assess several parameter include : stroke volume index ( SVI ) , cardiac index ( CI ) , systemic vascular resistance index ( SVRI ) , well oxygen delivery ( DO2 ) .The main aim goal-directed therapy achieve normal oxygen delivery tissue i.e . DO2 500-600ml/min/m2.• Hb would optimize &gt; 90 g/l - SaO2 &gt; 96 % - Stroke volume index ( SVI ) &gt; 30 - Heart rate ideally &lt; 80 Stroke volume index ( SVI ) &gt; 30 achieve repeated volume substitution form 100-200 ml colloid . If , despite bolus dos colloid , SVI &lt; 30 , one would use ionotropic drug e.g . dobutamine levosimendan , order achieve goa The study would do three hospital : University Hospital , Linköping , University Hospital , Örebro Jönköping Hospital . A total 200 patient ( 100 group ) would include . It expect study would ongoing period two year .</detailed_description>
