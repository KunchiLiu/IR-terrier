	<brief_summary>Asthma usually respond standard dos inhaled steroid without additional therapy control symptom . However , approximately 5-10 % respond treatment strategy refer difficult asthma . Evidence show poor response always relate asthma severity non-adherence treatment common underlying problem , 35 % subject . Recognising non-adherence clinic problematic straightforward objective test identify . Patients attend asthma clinic whose symptom control standard treatment assess airway inflammation use fractional exhaled nitric oxide , sputum analysis . These subject observe take medication determine reduces level airway inflammation . Prescription record use ascertain test distinguishes non-adherent treatment adult severe asthma . Identifying patient non-adherent treatment allow appropriate change management enable alternative strategy develop tackle non-adherence population . Distinguishing patient adherent treatment therapy resistant disease would significantly improve treatment effectiveness group allow patient suitably target expensive novel therapy Omalizumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide Identification Non-adherence Difficult Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : In difficult asthma population , significant reduction fractional exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) sputum eosinophils directly observe inhale steroid challenge distinguish non-adherent subject subject refractory asthma . Study Design The study consist two phase . The development phase identify response FeNO / sputum eosinophils directly observe inhale steroid challenge , non-adherent subject define cut-off value positive negative test identify optimum length steroid challenge . The validation phase trial validate test 'real life ' clinical setting . Phase 1 - Development Phase During phase , two group study : - Non-adherent group - subject &lt; 50 % prescription fill previous 6 month persistently high FeNO . - Adherent group - subject high prescription filling ( &gt; 75 % ) persistently high FeNO . On Day 0 , subject FeNO measurement repeat , perform induce sputum complete asthma control questionnaire . After inhaler technique deem satisfactory , subject directly observe take 1600μg inhaled budesonide via Turbohaler ( bioequivalent dose Budesonide via MDI / spacer ) . On next 6 day , investigator visit subject perform FeNO measurement , follow directly observe inhalation 1600 μg inhale budesonide via appropriate inhaler device . On Day 7 , subject undergo FeNO measurement , induce sputum asthma control questionnaire . Following fail suppress FeNO level receive intramuscular injection Triamcinolone 80mg ask attend clinic weekly 4 week measurement FeNO level induce sputum . Based result investigator : 1 . Identify clearly different response FeNO / sputum eosinophils adherent non-adherent group 7 day treatment period , observed high dose inhale steroid therapy , define clinical utility technique . 2 . Define cut-off value positive test ( i.e . consistent non-adherence ) negative test mean adherence consequently refractory asthma . 3 . Define optimal length steroid challenge validation phase base clinical ease use differentiation precision . Phase 2 - Validation real life Clinical Setting Having define test , validation phase involve prospectively recruit subject , raise FeNO investigator access prescription record stage . These subject undergo steroid challenge define deem adherent non-adherent . After steroid challenge perform , compare prescription record patient confrontation identify challenge identify non-adherence .</detailed_description>
