	<brief_summary>Glucocorticosteroids recently show non-genomic action plasma membrane-mediated require gene transcription translation . One non-genomic effect inhibition adrenergic agonist transport airway vascular smooth muscle cell increase adrenergic agonist concentration adrenergic receptor site enhance physiological effect endogenous adrenergic agonist ( e.g . locally release norepinephrine noradrenergic neuron ) exogenous adrenergic agonist ( e.g . inhale beta-adrenergic agonist ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inhaled glucocorticosteroids typically recommend treatment acute asthma attack . This practice base fact glucocorticosteroids cause rapid bronchodilation . However , acute inhibition adrenergic agonist disposal non-genomic action glucocorticosteroids could lead bronchial vasoconstriction locally release norepinephrine thereby decongesting airway wall , potentiate bronchodilator effect concomitantly administer beta-adrenergic agonist mechanism . The purpose study assess vasoconstrictive effect single repetitive high-dose budesonide inhalation moderate severe asthmatic use inhaled glucocorticosteroids regularly . As secondary endpoint , airway inflammation airway function also measure expectation acute improvement airflow might detectable result airway decongestion , notably subject moderately severe asthma low baseline lung function .</detailed_description>
