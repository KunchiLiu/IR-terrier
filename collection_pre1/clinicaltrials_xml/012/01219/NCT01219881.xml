	<detailed_description>This single-center , prospective , randomize , double-blind , double-arm trial include 68 subject schedule undergo urological cystoscope surgeries general anesthesia ( GA ) intubation laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) The Ohio State University Medical Center ( OSUMC ) . Double blinding base subject research staff unaware trial arm subject randomize . Eligible subject provide voluntary write informed consent include study . Day -14 0 Subjects undergo screening procedure 14 day prior administration study treatment . The research staff collect subject ' medical history ( include reason surgery , schedule surgical procedure , anesthesia modality , schedule surgery length ) , demographic ( include gender , age , race ) , allergy , history smoking , history alcohol drug abuse , medication , history postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) , history motion sickness . A physical examination also perform time . Day 0 Upon enrolment , subject randomly assign 1:1 ratio , pre-determined randomization schedule , research pharmacist one two anesthetic treatment group : Anesthesia maintain desflurane anesthesia maintain sevoflurane . Prior surgery , urine serum pregnancy test perform vitals collect . Subjects ' baseline pain nausea assess use eleven point numeric rating scale ( NRS-11 ) 15 , 0 equivalent none 10 equivalent severe , prior enter operating room ( OR ) . Cognitive function evaluate term level orientation , memory , concentration ( SOMCT ) . The SOMCT evaluation perform request subject ' recall current year month , one sentence , repeat numerical reverse order sequence month year . These 6 variable yield score range 0 28 , high score indicate well cognitive function ( Appendix 2 ) . Subjects premedicated 0.5 2 mg midazolam IV pre-operative hold area . The subject transport operating room assist onto operating table , ASA standard monitor apply determined anesthesiologist must include oxygen saturation monitor bispectral index ( BIS ) monitor . The BIS monitor apply prior induction anesthesia . Subject vital sign BIS value record every 5 minute throughout operation record anesthesia record . The subject preoxygenated use spontaneous mask ventilation 100 % FiO2 fresh gas flow 6 L/min oxygen one four minute prior induction . Anesthesia induction perform via bolus injection 2 mg/kg IV propofol 1 2 mcg/kg fentanyl intravenous ( IV ) bolus . After completion bolus injection propofol , inhale anesthetic vaporizer open 1 MAC ( 5.4 7.4 % desflurane 1.4 2.5 % sevoflurane ) base study randomization one two minute use masked ventilation . Following masked ventilation jaw thrust maneuver perform , fresh gas inflow ( vaporizer ) turn , lubricate LMA insert . The size brand LMA record . After verification proper placement seal around LMA , inflow immediately turn back 4 6 L/min 100 % oxygen vaporizer set 1 MAC three minute patient place volume pressure control mechanical ventilation . Ventilation verify via documentation bilateral breath sound chest rise . Following three five minute , inhalational anesthesia maintain either desflurane sevoflurane ( 0.5 1 MAC ) inspire 50:50 air/oxygen mixture total gas flow rate 1 L/min . This base randomization subject prior surgery one two group inhale anesthetic . Additional bolus fentanyl , propofol , vasopressor administer need maintain analgesia hemodynamics , include heart rate , spontaneous respiratory rate , mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) , within 20 % baseline . At end procedure , upon closure surgical incision , inhalational anesthetic agent discontinue fresh gas flow increase 6 8 L/min 100 % oxygen . All patient maintain inhaled anesthestic 0.5 MAC either desflurane sevoflurane throughout surgery . Each episode cough induction anesthesia subject awake orient record blind observer grade accord scale Coughing define ; 1 single cough occur SpO2 ≥ 95 % ; 2 multiple cough occur SpO2 ≥ 95 % ; 3 multiple cough occur SpO2 &lt; 95 % ; 4 multiple cough occur , SpO2 &lt; 95 % coughing require administration IV medication . Awakening anesthesia ( eye-opening ) assess research staff ask subject follow verbal command ( touch ) one-minute interval discontinuation volatile anesthetic . The time appropriateness extubation also record one-minute interval discontinuation inhalational agent . Prior removal LMA , subject determine awake `` eyes-open '' command deem appropriate anesthesiologist . Anesthesia procedure start end time , admission discharge time post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) time discharge hospital also record . Post-anesthesia recovery ( physical status ) evaluate , accord Aldrete score16 , 5 minute extubation every 5 minute subject reach Aldrete score ≥ 9 . Subjects able move extremity spontaneously command , breathe cough , systolic blood pressure value within 20 mmHg pre-anesthetic level baseline level , alert arousable quiet voice , able maintain SpO2 &gt; 90 % supplementary O2 administration face mask low concentration need ensure Pao2 100 200 mmHg ( Appendix 1 ) After subject reach postoperative Aldrete score ≥9 , research staff perform SOMCT test evaluate postoperative cognitive function every 15 minute first hour surgery time discharge PACU . At 24 hour surgery overall satisfaction assess ask subject experience anesthetic medication use 3 point rating scale , personal interview phone call , blind research staff . Satisfaction rat scale : 2 equivalent highly satisfied , 1 equivalent satisfy 0 equivalent dissatisfy . All medication take 24 hour prior treatment record . Any drug potential antiemetic property , intraoperative medication , daily consumption opioids record 24 hour postoperatively discharge hospital whichever come first . Adverse event serious adverse event record time consent discharge . Safety Assessments : Safety parameter assess monitor vital sign , adverse event , either urine serum pregnancy test . A physical exam perform screening . The occurrence adverse event ( AE ) serious adverse event ( SAE ) record time consent discharge . For adverse event , relationship study medication , severity , expectedness adverse event outcome determine principal investigator record study source accordingly . In case subject withdraws study serious adverse event ( SAE ) , local IRB notify within 10 day . Adverse event definition An AE define untoward medical occurrence patient clinical investigation subject administer medicinal product necessarily causal relationship treatment . An AE unfavorable unintended sign , symptom , abnormal laboratory finding , temporal disease associate use study drug , whether consider related study drug . Planned hospital admission and/or surgical operation illness disease exist subject enrol clinical study consider part subject ' medical history consider AEs . Serious adverse event A SAE untoward medical occurrence dose : - Results death - Is life-threatening - Results persistent significant disability/incapacity - Requires in-subject hospitalization prolongs hospitalization - Is congenital anomaly/birth defect - Is another medically-significant event , base upon appropriate medical judgment , may jeopardize subject may require medical surgical intervention prevent one outcomes list Withdrawal criterion study According Declaration Helsinki , participant right withdraw study time reason . The principal investigator also right remove subject study . Reasons subject may remove study include : - An adverse event - The request subject , his/her legal representative caregiver , investigator , whether administrative reason - Non - compliance medication , protocol violation unreliable , behavior - Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory value clinically significant abnormality identify principal investigator accord clinical judgment . These follow appropriate test and/or procedure value return normal , clinically acceptable level , attribute cause study drug The principal investigator may withdraw enrol treat subject study follow reason : - Occurrence serious intolerable adverse event - Emergence clinically significant change laboratory parameter ( ) - The subject request discontinue study - A protocol violation sufficiently serious require subject withdrawal - General specific change subject 's condition render treatment unreasonable unsafe within standard clinical practice judgment principal investigator treat physician . Any subject may leave study time . If subject decides stop participate study , penalty . The subject lose benefit otherwise entitle .</detailed_description>
