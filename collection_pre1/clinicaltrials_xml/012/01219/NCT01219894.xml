	<brief_summary>Patients receive drug-coated stent ( oppose less frequently use bare metal stent ) currently recommend aspirin plus thienopyridine Plavix , Effient , Ticlid one year . These guideline apply patient drug-coated stent , regardless type stent receive . The purpose medication prevent clot stent site poor heal artery tissue stent . A clot serious concern suddenly block blood flow heart cause heart attack . These medication proven helpful stent patient , risk . The common side-effects related bleeding patient serious . A patient may risk form clot must put medication hold surgical procedure reduce risk bleeding . Plavix Effient also expensive patient underinsured uninsured . There interest find way show patient 's stent heal properly 12 month safely stop medication early . This study look way determine patient receive Endeavor drug-coated stent prescribe aspirin Plavix safely stop Plavix 3 month instead 12 . Previous study show 99.9 % coverage body 's tissue Endeavor stent 3 month . A device call Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) catheter use study look much stent heal . It allow image inside heart artery ability see heal tissue stent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravascular Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging - Length Anti-Platelet Therapy After Drug Eluting Stent Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There need find personalized approach prescribe dual anti-platelet therapy stent place coronary artery . Stenting involves insert expand metal tube-shaped device heart artery blockage limit blood flow heart muscle . This device stay artery permanently body 's tissue grow time . Patients study Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) image do stent placement 3 month later follow-up angiography . Patients sufficient stent heal 3 month stop take Plavix . Patients poor stent heal 3 month continue Plavix 12 month . Patients call month first year see take prescribed medicine . Other diagnostic method use patient suspected heart blockage include intravascular ultrasound ( device catheter allow ultrasound image inside vessel ) , fractional flow reserve ( measurement blood flow determine blockages serious enough need treatment ) , angiography ( injection dye artery look narrowing blockage ) . These method use look severity heart blockages patient already sign symptom . They appropriate device see patient 's previous stent heal properly certain period time . The long-term effectiveness stenting procedure treat symptomatic coronary artery disease limit need take dual anti-platelet therapy ( DAPT ) aspirin plavix prevent complication related clot formation within device due incomplete healing stented segment . While anti-platelet pharmacologic therapy minimize risk , associate increase risk serious bleed event . Currently patient receive drug elute stent ( DES ) advise take plavix twelve month although personalized approach determine appropriate duration anti-platelet therapy patient patient basis would reduce thrombosis bleeding , thereby improve long-term safety coronary revascularization procedure . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) new high resolution image modality potential discern stent strut heal follow-up thus allow individual tailor anti-platelet regimen . Among commercially available coated stent use U.S. , zotarolimus elute stent ( ZES Endeavor ) demonstrate superior endothelialization long term safety data preclinical clinical study likely early discontinuation anti-platelet therapy safe . In trial , patient undergo ZES placement symptomatic CAD undergo 3 month follow-up OCT image determine stent strut healing . Patients demonstrate complete heal withdrawn plavix ( aspirin continue ) evidence incomplete heal continued DAPT another 9 month . All patient follow clinically another 9 month intercurrent adverse event record . In end , research establish OCT determined stent heal surrogate measure determine optimal anti-platelet therapy follow DES implantation .</detailed_description>
