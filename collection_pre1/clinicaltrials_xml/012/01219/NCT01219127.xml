	<detailed_description>【Background Purpose】Management chronic diabetic ulcer require multidisciplinary approach include diabetic control , wound care , antibiotic , shoe wear load , surgery select case . The result inconsistent irregular , study report unsatisfactory result . Many adjunctive therapy implement care chronic skin ulcer include hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBO ) , ultrasound , recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB ( rPDGF-BB ) , vacuum assist wound closure ( VAWC ) acellular matrix . HBO commonly utilized institution . Mixed result HBO chronic skin ulcer report . Several study report beneficial effect chronic skin ulcer , none show universal success . Therefore , development new effective method treatment chronic skin ulcer extremely valuable . Wang et al demonstrated extracorporeal shockwave act mechanotransduction produce therapeutic benefit complex biological pathway include neovascularization tissue regeneration . Gerdesmeyer et al show bacteriostatic effect shockwave experiment . Schaden et al report effectiveness extracorporeal shockwave acute chronic soft tissue wound . Saggini et report effectiveness ESWT chronic skin ulcer 50 % completely heal within 6 session treatment . However , work mechanism ESWT discuss . With background , appear extracorporeal shockwave may effective treatment chronic diabetic ulcer . We conduct pilot study use orthowave 180 ( TRT , Woodstock , GA ) treatment chronic ulcer . The preliminary result pilot study 26 patient 31 ulcer show heal &gt; 50 % improved ulcer 90 % , 10 % unchanged none worse . The result pilot study publish Journal Surgical Research 2009 ; 152 : 96-103 . The poster exhibit study 1st place award category tumor metabolism 75th AAOS annual meeting San Francisco , CA March 2008 . This study continue research use derma-PACE ( derma-pulse acoustic cellular expression ) . Derma-PACE ( Sanuwave , Alpharetta , GA ) new shockwave device design treatment diabetic ulcer . The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety Derma-PACE shockwave device treatment chronic diabetic ulcer , compare result hyperbaric oxygen therapy , investigate blood flow perfusion , histopathological examination immunohistochemical analysis . 【Patient selection】This study approve The Institutional Review Board Human Studies . The procedure perform accordance standard Ethical Committee Declaration Helsinki 1975 . All patient require sign inform consent prior participation study . The inclusion criterion include patient recurrent chronic diabetic ulcer extremity longer 3 month duration . The exclusion criterion include patient cardiac arrhythmia pacemaker , pregnancy , skeletal immaturity patient malignancy , patient joint sepsis , ulcer around skull , spine chest wall , patient poor compliance . A power analysis reveal sample size 32 group would require establish statistical significance α = 0.05 power = 0.8 . We anticipate drop-out rate 10 15 % various reason course treatment . Therefore , plan recruit 100 patient study . Patients randomly divide two group 50 patient shockwave group , 50 patient HBO group treat HBOT . All patient receive protocol diabetic control , wound care , antibiotic corrective shoe wear etc . Pre-treatment evaluation include complete history physical examination , chemistry coagulation profile , detail past surgical medical treatment . The ankle-brachial index ( AKI ) HBA1C assess individually . 【Technical descriptions】 【Shockwave application】The derma-PACE device set E2 @ 4 Hz energy level 0.11 mJ/mm² energy flux density . The dosage shockwave wind size dependent . The treatment area include actual wound area extend 1.0 cm periphery every direction . The number pulse = treatment area ( cm² ) x 8 , case least 500 shock . The treatment perform twice/week total 6 treatment . 【Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy】Patients receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBO ) seal multi-place chamber pressure 2.5 atmosphere absolute ( ATA ) . The treatment start compression air pressure 1 ATA 2.5 ATA 15 minute . Patients breathe 100 % medical grade O2 mask 25 minute take mask O2 break 5 minute , , repeat breathe 100 % O2 mask another 25 minute mask O2 break 5 minute . At end treatment , chamber air pressure decompress 2.5 ATA O2 mask 1 ATA 15 minute . Each patient receive HBO daily , five day week total 40 treatment . 【Evaluation parameter : 】The evaluation parameter include clinical assessment , local blood flow perfusion , bacteriological examination , histopathological evaluation immunohistochemical analysis biopsy specimen . The ulcer quantitatively assess use S ( AD ) SAD classification size , shape configuration photo-documentation treatment . The neuropathic sensory change foot examine pin-prick test . The circulatory status affect limb evaluate digital palpation dorsalis pulsation ultrasound Doppler perfusion scan . Local blood flow perfusion scan , bacterial culture sensitivity , biopsy periphary ulcer include normal skin perform treatment , specimen subject histomorphological examination immunohistochemicial stain . The data treatment within group data two group analyze statistically . 【Anticipated work schedule result : 】We estimate enroll 2 3 patient per week , take approximately one year recruit sufficient number patient . It require 12 additional month follow-up . Therefore , estimate total three year complete study . We anticipate favorable result ESWT chronic diabetic ulcer . We also anticipate superior result ESWT HBO therapy . Furthermore , anticipate improvement local blood flow perfusion , antibacterial effect well angiogenesis tissue regeneration effect ESWT . This novel method treatment may bring new insight management chronic diabetic ulcer . Shockwave potential cure chronic skin ulcer without surgery directly benefit thousand patient suffer disastrous disease .</detailed_description>
