	<brief_summary>Fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) widely use cancer image purpose , notably preoperative work-up . It aim visualize organ metabolism . In case cancer , metabolism , classically , increase hot spot visible PET image . Because respiratory motion liver intrinsically FDG avid , tumour ( especially small one ) occult missed clinician . The investigator develop respiratory-gated PET method order reduce motion issue . This protocol validate lung pathology . The investigator design study investigate effect liver cancer ( primary metastasis ) check allow detection high number tumour lesion . To aim , patient plan undergo surgical intervention liver propose participate study . After standard PET acquisition ( acquire free-breathing ) , additional 10 minute respiratory-gated PET acquisition perform without additional injection . After , breath-hold ( ~10s ) CT perform .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) become major image modality management patient suspect hepatic cancer notably ability detect distant metastasis . Hepatic resection know curative treatment subset patient suffer liver neoplasm . Eligibility hepatic surgery lay conventional stag comprise contrast-enhanced CT , magnetic resonance image ultrasonography liver . Recently , 18F-FGD PET/CT introduce stag modality preoperative work . However , many physiological issue could affect PET interpretation . Indeed , lesion could miss physician due histology lesion ( e.g . case moderate well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) mucinous carcinoma ) . Unlike , local inflammation could wrongly consider malignant . Another issue liver examination PET image respiratory motion produce blur reconstruct image . Therefore , lesion may miss underestimated . This motion issue well know thoracic image various method propose deal . We develop respiratory motion compensation method gate PET event select base breath-hold CT ( CT-based ) . To knowledge , sensitivity study perform assess usefulness gate acquisition term lesion detection abdominal stage . W In trial , apply gate method liver compare lesion-per-lesion sensitivity clinical ( Ungated ) CT-based PET image . PET/CT acquisition : All acquisition ( Ungated CT-based ) perform whole-body PET/CT system . - Whole-body PET/CT ( Ungated session ) The Ungated acquisition consist whole-body , free-breathing CT ( 110 kV ; 85 mAs ; pitch : 1 ) follow standard multistep PET ( 3 minute per step ) , use routine clinical practice department . - Respiratory-gated PET/CT ( CT-based session ) The CT-based method consist additional single-step , 10-minute List Mode respiratory gate PET acquisition follow end-expiration breath-hold CT ( 110 kV ; 50 mAs ; pitch : 2 ) add end clinical protocol , continuous respiratory signal record examination . To summarize respiratory-gated PET processing , breath-hold CT sequence visible respiratory signal plateau . A selection range place around plateau select PET event correspond position tissue time breath-hold CT . Image Reconstruction : After compensation random coincidence , 3-dimensional ( 3D ) sinograms FORE-rebinned two dimension scatter-corrected . The attenuation coefficients 511 keV calculate CT acquisition , order correct tissue self-attenuation . Ungated volumes correct free-breathing whole-body CT scan CT-based volume correct end-expiration breath-hold CT. All PET volume reconstruct use AWOSEM follow parameter : 4 iteration , 8 order subset 168 x 168 x 81 matrix ( 4.06 mm x 4.06 mm x 2 mm ) . Finally , 3D isotropic Gaussian post filter full width half maximum 5 mm apply . Image analysis : Each PET examination blindly independently analyse experienced nuclear medicine physician , i.e . neither type image patient ' information know . Each clinician report number lesion detect Ungated CT-based PET datasets . Should case , lesion , ask precise location accord Couinaud segmental classification maximum standardize uptake value ( SUVmax ) . Surgical procedure histopathological analysis : During surgery , intraoperative ultrasound perform order detect localize liver lesion . Surgery aim obtain disease-free resection margin . The type liver resection ( hepatectomy wedge ( ) ) surgeon discretion well use radiofrequency tumour ablation . When available , surgical specimen analyse department histopathological analysis institution determine type cancer location resect lesion .</detailed_description>
