	<brief_summary>Hand-foot syndrome ( HFS ) , also know palmar-plantar erythrodysethesia ( PPE ) , occur 25 % -50 % patient treat several commonly use anti-cancer drug include capecitabine sunitinib . These drug know improve survival many cancer , include cancer colon , stomach , liver , breast , kidney , GI stromal tumor ( GIST ) . Worldwide , 400,000 patient per year treat one agent . HFS involve skin change , swell , peel , blister palm sol , often painful debilitate . As result , HFS-related symptom frequently lead dose reduction and/or discontinuation otherwise effective anti-cancer treatment . There treatment HFS dose reduction stop treatment . This proposal could quickly lead treatment prevent and/or treat HFS help patient avoid debilitate side effect continue otherwise effective treatment cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Palmar Plantar Erythrodysesthesia ( PPE ) With Topical Sildenafil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective evaluate whether topical sildenafil reduces severity hand foot syndrome palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia ( PPE ) associate sunitinib capecitabine . The secondary objective describe toxicity associate topical sildenafil . This randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled pilot study topical sildenafil patient grade 1-3 hand foot syndrome relate chemotherapeutic agent . Approximately 20 evaluable patient grade 1-3 PPE treat topical sildenafil : - 10 patient PPE relate sunitinib - 10 patient PPE related capecitabine Once eligibility screen criterion meet , subject give 2 type topical cream , one contain 1 % sildenafil citrate one contain placebo control . Subjects randomize apply sildenafil citrate cream either right leave hand/foot ; placebo cream apply opposite hand/ foot . Clinical history , physical examination photography hand foot perform every two week first 2 month patient sunitinib every 4-6 week thereafter . For patient capecitabine ( give every 3 week schedule ) , evaluation do every 3 week . Additional visit may perform clinically indicate . If PPE resolve , less frequent administration lower dos permit maintain response . For consistency , patient may first reduce treatment twice per day dose PPE resolve . If dosing schedule effective low concentration , e.g . 0.5 % , may use . Patient cream assignment un-blinded 8 9 week time period ( depend chemotherapy ) . However , patient 2 grade improvement PPE one hand versus ( e.g . grade 3 improves grade 1 , grade 2 improves grade 0 ) maintain least 2 week , eligible early un-blinding treatment active sildenafil hand foot . Patients may receive topical sildenafil 6 month study .</detailed_description>
