	<detailed_description>Urinary NGAL show early marker AKI follow paediatric cardiac surgery ( 2 hour pump ) . Previous study show early increase urinary NGAL follow cardiopulmonary bypass excellent predictor later &gt; 50 % increase serum creatinine concentration child undergo cardiac surgery . Increased urinary concentration NGAL find follow open heart surgery . When define AKI &gt; 50 % increase serum creatinine baseline , increase urinary NGAL concentration two hour pump appeared excellent predictor AKI . Several study include heterogeneous population patient age one month 21 year undergoing cardiac surgery . Besides , NGAL concentration study neonate open heart surgery , neither identify threshold accurate prediction severe AKI require renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) . If threshold identify , urinary NGAL could provide intervention . The aim observational cohort study describe postoperative kinetics urinary NGAL neonate identify threshold accurate prediction severe AKI require RRT neonates infant undergo cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass . The study entirely observational , decision initiate RRT continue base clinical evidence fluid overload , low cardiac output oliguria . Urine sample collect early postoperative period , store , NGAL concentration measure ARCHITECT platform .</detailed_description>
