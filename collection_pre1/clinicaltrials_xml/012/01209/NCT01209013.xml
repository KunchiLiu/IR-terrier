	<brief_summary>Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) use combination drug , porfimer sodium , light non heat laser . The activation drug do light abnormal area use fiber optic device . The fiber optic device fine fiber ( like fish line ) permit transmission light . The fiber optic device insert diffuse balloon device ensure good positioning fiber optic within esophagus ( food pipe ) . It think size flexibility new diffuse balloon device could improve safety profile photodynamic treatment reduce risk narrow closure food pipe ( esophageal stenosis ) sometimes occur treatment . This research study evaluate safety effectiveness PDT porfimer sodium use new diffuse balloon device light application removal high-grade dysplasia ( HGD , precancerous change food pipe tissue ) Barrett 's esophagus ( BE ) . This study provide advance knowledge phototoxicity ( reaction similar sunburn ) esophageal stenosis , main risk therapy . It involve 75 patient HGD BE across North America Europe last 13 16 week . In addition , concentration porfimer sodium esophageal tissue analyze subgroup patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Photodynamic Therapy ( PDT ) Ablation High-grade Dysplasia ( HGD ) Barrett 's Esophagus ( BE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients biopsy-confirmed HGD BE evaluate confirm eligibility . Prior enrollment , inclusion exclusion criterion verify . Medical procedure include demographic information , medical/surgical history , concurrent medical condition , physical exam ( include vital sign , body weight , height , skin color ) , degree difficulty swallowing ; electrocardiogram , chest X-ray , clinical laboratory testing , concomitant medication intake therapy use collect . All patient receive one course PDT consist intravenous injection 2.0 mg/kg porfimer sodium 3-5 minute follow one two endoscopic laser light application . The first laser light application perform within 40-50 hour use new diffuse balloon catheter . The second laser light application ( without diffuse balloon catheter ) perform within 96-120 hour area show insufficient response first application . Follow-ups ( Weeks 4 13 ) include follow procedure : physical exam ; vital sign evaluation ; body weight ; endoscopy ; skin , degree difficulty swallow esophageal stenosis assessment ; clinical laboratory check . All patient ask general open question occurrence adverse event , change concurrent medical condition , use adjunctive therapy/procedure , intake concomitant medication . All patient undergo rigorous systematic endoscopic biopsy surveillance Week 13 ( final visit ) . Tissue concentration oligomers ( component porfimer sodium ) normal abnormal esophageal tissue determine subgroup 12 patient . These patient provide esophageal tissue sample porfimer sodium injection four separate occasion injection ( 22-26 hour- , 40-50 hour- , 96-120 hour-intervals , 13 week ) . All patient follow three month .</detailed_description>
