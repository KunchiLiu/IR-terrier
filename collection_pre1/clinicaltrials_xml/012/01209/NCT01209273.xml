	<brief_title>Comparison Quality Life Automated Peritoneal Dialysis Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Automated peritoneal dialysis ( APD ) first described 1981 , 5 year introduction continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) . It increasingly use increasingly used comparison CAPD 20 % 1995 33 % PD patient North America 1998 , 2000 , 54 % PD patient United States perform form APD . APD several advantage CAPD reduce incidence peritonitis , mechanical complication great psychosocial acceptability . Many study demonstrate benefit APD . In one Mexican retrospective study , APD well technical survival CAPD improvement 1st peritonitis episode French registry data show well peritonitis-free probability autonomy APD compare CAPD . One study find peritonitis rate hospitalization significantly less patient APD result express episode/patient-year . Also small randomize clinical trial compare APD CAPD show APD help keep select patient vocationally socially active . Although APD expect improve good condition peritoneal dialysis patient , convince evidence major advantage lack benefit APD demonstrate . In three randomized clinical trial , APD , APD differ CAPD respect mortality ( RR 1.49 , 95 % CI 0.51 4.37 ) , risk peritonitis ( RR 0.75 , 95 % CI 0.50 1.11 ) , switch original PD modality different dialysis modality ( RR 0.50 , 95 % CI 0.25 1.02 ) , hernia ( RR 1.26 , 95 % CI 0.32 5.01 ) , PD fluid leak ( RR 1.06 , 95 % CI 0.11 9.83 ) , PD catheter removal ( RR 0.64 , 95 % CI 0.27 1.48 ) hospital admission ( RR0.96 , 95 % CI 0.43 2.17 ) . In addition APD potential disadvantage compare CAPD like possible faster residual renal function , less sodium removal peritoneal protein loss expensive CAPD . All three large cohort , NECOSAD , USRDS ANZDATA show risk technical failure different APD CAPD similar . Because result comparison APD CAPD vague , prospective , observational multi-center study incident patient require gain insight survival APD compare CAPD course peritoneal dialysis . Quality Life important outcome parameter advise patient renal replace treatment modality section . The introduction machine assist patient PD exchange potentially improve quality life different way . De Wit et al . analyze health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) 37 APD 59 CAPD patient 16 different Dutch dialysis center . In multivariate analysis , mental health find good APD compare CAPD patient . In addition , indication APD patient tend less depressed anxious CAPD patient . In prospective randomize trial , Bro et al . find difference CAPD APD patient quality life measure . However APD patient tend time work , family , social activity compare CAPD patient . From limited data , possibly conclude quality life important evaluate lifestyle patient adapt PD regimen . Therefore , quality life ( QoL ) assessment expect evidence support hypothesis APD superior CAPD . And incidences clinical event treatment modality change , peritonitis episode , exit site/tunnel infection , hospitalization , death , cancer development ) also review support hypothesis .</detailed_description>
