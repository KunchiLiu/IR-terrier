	<brief_summary>Hyperphenylalaninemia ( HPA ) rare metabolic disorder cause deficiency enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . Elevated plasma level phenylalanine ( phe ) cause mental retardation , microcephaly , delay speech , seizure , eczema , behavior problem . Adequate control plasma level phe phe-restricted diet prevent developmental behavioral problem . The foundation diet phe-free medical product/formula make free amino acid . Based longitudinal study , report benefit attained individual maintain phe-restricted diet throughout life . Despite obvious benefit diet , suggest dietary restriction may associate poor bone health patient . However , data support report study small sample size and/or inadequate sample population include child . There paucity data bone health adult HPA . The investigator propose observational study describe bone health status among adult diagnosis HPA compare establish normative age gender-specific value among healthy individual . The investigator hypothesize adult HPA low bone density measure dual x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan compare establish normative value .</brief_summary>
