	<brief_summary>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate safety efficacy RoActemra/Actemra ( tocilizumab ) patient ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) fail treatment non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug naïve tumor necrsos factor ( TNF ) antagonist therapy . In Part 1 study , patient randomize receive either RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg intravenously ( IV ) placebo every 4 week 12 week . In Part 2 , patient randomize receive RoActemra either 8 mg/kg 4 mg/kg IV placebo every 4 week 24 week . The double-blind treatment period follow open-label treatment RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg iv every 4 week Week 208 patient . Anticipated time study treatment 208 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study plan Phase II/III seamless , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study patient AS naïve TNF antagonist therapy . The study consist 2 part , precede screen visit follow common open-label extension phase . Recruitment Part 2 commence completion enrollment Part 1 . Part 1 design Phase II study explore efficacy safety tocilizumab therapy versus placebo . Part 1 intend determine whether Part 2 study would continue , base Week 12 analysis . Part 2 design provide pivotal Phase III efficacy safety data tocilizumab patient AS . Approximately 400 patient enrol . Once randomization Part 1 complete , randomization Part 2 study initiate . Based result Week 12 Part 1 analysis primary endpoint ( ASAS20 ) secondary endpoint , consideration available safety data , benefit/risk assessment make decide halt study lack overall efficacy . Most patient complete 24-week double-blind treatment period Part 2 .</detailed_description>
