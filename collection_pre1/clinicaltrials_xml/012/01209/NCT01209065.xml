	<brief_summary>GSK1349572 integrase inhibitor develop treatment human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -1 infection GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) behalf Shionogi-ViiV HealthcareLLC . In HIV-infected patient combination antiretroviral therapy standard care , likely dose boost protease inhibitor ( PIs ) include fosamprenavir/ritonavir ( FPV/RTV FPV/r ) . As FPV RTV modulators ( induction well inhibition ) Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase ( UGT ) Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A primary secondary metabolic pathway GKS1349572 , likely FPV/RTV affect pharmacokinetics ( PK ) GSK1349572 , therefore drug interaction study warrant evaluated Part A study . Part B evaluate effect particle size tablet variant PK GSK1349572 . In Part A , approximately 12 subject receive GSK1349572 50mg every 24 hour ( q24h ) 5 day ( Treatment A ) . Subjects administer GSK1349572 50mg q24h combination FPV/RTV 700/100 mg every 12 hour ( q12h ) ( Treatment B ) 10 day . There washout treatment . In Part B 15 subject receive single 50 mg dose ( 2 x 25mg tablet ) 3 different tablet variant formulation , differ particle size GSK1349572 , fast condition three-way crossover design . Safety evaluations serial PK sample collect treatment period . A follow-up visit occur 7-14 day last dose study drug .</brief_summary>
