	<brief_summary>Paracetamol overdose lead cause acute liver failure Western World . N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) antidote choice 30 year use associate adverse effect 40 % case . Patients characteristically experience nausea , vomit anaphylactoid ( 'pseudo-allergic ' ) syndrome . This reaction clinically similar true anaphylaxis ( allergic reaction ) include flushing , rash , constriction airway , fall blood pressure , occur via different mechanism . Although treatable , reaction lead patient distress , commonly cause confusion among treat physician , lead significant delay antidote administration . The aetiology adverse reaction NAC remain unclear . We hypothesise : ) reaction result dose-dependent release chemical histamine , cause dilatation blood vessel ( vasodilatation ) anaphylactoid syndrome ; ii ) paracetamol conversely exert protective effect reaction , less severe reaction observe presence high paracetamol concentration . We investigate mechanism underlie adverse reaction NAC human forearm model , examine role histamine marker involve inflammatory process . The wider significance improve understanding poorly delineate phenomenon , implication medication associate similar reaction , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug opioids morphine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study investigator test follow hypothesis : 1 . NAC cause dose-dependent vasodilatation associate histamine release vivo . 2 . Release mediator , know associated anaphylaxis , occur anaphylactoid reaction NAC . 3 . Paracetamol protective role NAC adverse reaction . Investigation hypotheses man difficult . While local skin change intradermal NAC use examine dose-response patient , approach lend detailed investigation underlie mechanism use explore effect high paracetamol concentration . We propose use alternative well-established model previously use u investigate mechanism involve pharmacodynamics morphine man measurement forearm blood flow skin response follow intra-arterial infusion . The propose model allow administration dos far small use systemically thus minimise risk unwanted systemic effect either NAC paracetamol . Safe administration intra-arterial NAC ( 300 mg/min , great intend ) previously demonstrate . Local change use surrogate systemic effect , describe previously . We take structured 3-part approach research hypotheses . Studies 1 2 aim establish dose-response curve seek evidence tachyphylaxis , measure level histamine release . The presence tachyphylaxis may help explain , clinical setting , NAC often safely re-introduced follow reaction . In study 3 , investigator intend conduct 4-way randomise control crossover mechanistic study . This examine pharmacodynamic effect NAC presence absence histamine antagonist ( antihistamine ) , low- high-dose paracetamol . This study also enable investigation possible protective role paracetamol . For study , investigator recruit healthy male volunteer age 18 64 year . Subjects non-smokers concomitant medication . Individuals clinically significant co-morbidity heart failure , hypertension , hyperlipidaemia , diabetes mellitus , asthma , coagulopathy bleeding disorder exclude . Exclusion criterion also include individual recent infective inflammatory condition recently donate blood ( within last 3 month ) . Each study perform quiet , temperature-controlled room maintain 22-24ÂºC subject lie supine . Participants fast abstained caffeine tobacco least 4 hour alcohol 24 hour study . Subjects undergo cannulation brachial artery one arm sterile 27-standard wire gauge steel needle . Study drug infuse via cannula . Blood drawn infuse control arm via 17-gauge venous cannulae insert arm local anaesthesia . After 30-min lead-in period , forearm blood flow measure 6-10 minute interval infuse non-infused arm venous occlusion plethysmography use mercury-in-silastic strain gauge describe previously . Subjects may recruit one study provide minimum 1 week pass study . Study 1 : Dose-response study Sufficient volunteer recruit complete 8 study use incremental rise dose infusion intra-arterial NAC ( 6 dos ) determine dose response curve arterial vasodilatation forearm . After washout period 30 min ensure return normal state , repeat determine whether response consistent time . Study 1 identify dose use study 2 cause maximum local forearm vasodilatation without systemic effect ( rise contralateral forearm blood flow , blood pressure , heart rate , facial flushing ) . Our hypothesis increase histamine may observe response NAC , change mediator commonly associate anaphylactic reaction demonstrate . Blood sample obtain baseline , end study , 10-min interval incremental dose infusion NAC include 6 dos administer ( total 14 occasion ) . To maximise efficiency address hypothesis intend measure histamine NAC time point . Enough blood also draw occasion measurement potential inflammatory mediator , include tryptase , vWF , tPA , IL-6 , PGD2 , PGI2 . Study 2 : Acute tolerance study Acute tolerance investigate study 2 . Eight study complete use constant infusion NAC 60 min dose identify study 1 . Forearm vasodilatation level histamine release measure every 10 min . This study may help explain clinical set NAC often safely reintroduce , without complication , follow reaction . Blood sample obtain baseline , end study , 10-min interval infusion NAC ( total 8 occasion ) . Histamine NAC measure time point blood store later measurement potential mediator appropriate follow result study 1 . Study 3 : Mechanistic study Study 3 4-way randomise control crossover study investigate potential mediator . Sufficient subject recruit complete 8 study , volunteer attend 4 time . At visit , subject receive increase dose infusion NAC describe study 1 . In addition also receive one : 1 . Co-infusion normal saline ( control ) 2 . Co-infusion histamine antagonist ( H1 H2 antagonist ) 3 . Co-infusion low dose paracetamol give local concentration &lt; 50 mg/l 4 . Co-infusion high dose paracetamol give local concentration ~200 mg/l Blood sample obtain baseline , end study , 10-min interval incremental dose infusion NAC include 6 dos administer ( total 8 occasion ) . Histamine , NAC paracetamol assay measure time point . Blood also store later analysis mediator appropriate accord result study 1 . Drugs We previously administer intra-arterial NAC without complication . Assuming forearm blood flow 50 ml/min , infusion 25 mg/min would expect achieve local concentration ~500 mg/l , similar peak concentration reach standard 20-hour intravenous NAC protocol use hospital ward . We intend use range 6 incremental dos 10 min interval include concentration : 1 mg/min , 5 mg/min , 10 mg/min , 50 mg/min , 100 mg/min , 200 mg/min . The total infusion rate maintain 1 ml/min . Histamine antagonists current clinical use yet administer intr-arterial study . We intend use chlorphenamine ( H1 antagonist ) ranitidine ( H2 antagonist ) . Intravenous ( IV ) administration 10mg chlorphenamine result plasma concentration ~14 mcg/l . IA administration 1 mcg/min would achieve similar forearm concentration . Assuming NAC cause vasodilatation increase forearm blood flow , investigator propose administer 5 mcg/min ensure maximal H1 blockade . Similarly , IV administration 50mg ranitidine result plasma concentration ~150 mcg/l . IA administration 7.5 mcg/min would expect achieve similar forearm concentration . In presence increase forearm blood flow , investigator propose administer 37.5 mcg/min . Therapeutic IV administration 1g paracetamol result plasma concentration ~12 mg/l . To achieve desire concentration ~25 mg/l , presence forearm blood blow 50 ml/min , investigator would intend administer IA infusion 1.25 mg/min . To account presence increase forearm blood flow , investigator propose administer 4 mg/min IA paracetamol . To achieve high local PA concentration ~200 mg/l , concentration comparable potentially hepatotoxic concentration follow PA overdose , investigator propose administer 30 mg/min PA . Skin change Skin change assess assessment erythema oedema forearm record use Modified Draize Scale . Subjects also ask subjectively express intensity itch scale 1 ( itch ) 7 ( intense itch ) . Expertise available The study carry Clinical Research Facility Royal Infirmary Edinburgh , extensive experience perform study . Most assay undertake University Edinburgh laboratory , expertise assay . The principal investigator trainee clinical toxicologist necessary skill undertake research .</detailed_description>
