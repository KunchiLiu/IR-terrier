	<brief_summary>The trial investigate feasibility efficacy target Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) `` drive '' epigenetic change . The investigator study impact 5-azacitidine ( Vidaza® , Celgene , Summit , NJ , USA ) combination conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy sequential fashion . The study population consist NSCLC patient undergo `` curative '' lung cancer resection whose tumor harbor hypermethylation protocol-specific gene ( sample bank additional molecular test include 21 loci show important lung carcinogenesis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Residual Hypermethylation Early Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) As Part Adjuvant Therapy Preventive Strategy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adjuvant chemotherapy become essential part treatment stage IB-IIIA NSCLC patient base 4 randomized clinical trial show survival advantage patient receive adjuvant CT , oncologists initially start adapt modality treatment pathologically stage IB-IIIA NSCLC patient [ 4 ] . Herein , NSCLC patient treat adjuvant set conventional doublet platinum-based chemotherapy follow 5-azacitidine , demethylating agent . The planned dosage use trial extensively study previously conduct clinical trial involve therapeutic agent . All patient undergo thorough surgical resection primary lung tumor , evidence promoter hypermethylation gene ( ) must present tumor specimen and/or blood sample ( plasma WBC ) . The collection tumor specimen consider priority correlate tumor `` methylation pattern/profile '' serum `` methylation pattern/profile '' . If tumor specimen available reason , patient least one 9 target gene hypermethylated serum , patient eligible enrol trial . Treatment consist 2 part : Part A . Adjuvant chemotherapy . Following surgical resection NSCLC test positive promoter hypermethylation least one ( 1 ) target TSGs describe , patient start adjuvant conventional chemotherapy ( doublet platinum-based chemotherapy ) stage IB-IIIA NSCLC . In case patient stage IB refuse adjuvant chemotherapy , patient still enrol Part B study he/she understand concept trial sign inform consent . Conventional chemotherapy select discretion treat physician except case pathologic diagnosis indicate non squamous NSCLC . Those patient treat pemetrexed . Patients receive total 4 cycle adjuvant chemotherapy ( cycle give every 21 day ) . Pegfilgrastim , granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , allow day 2 discretion clinician . All patient premedicated prior paclitaxel docetaxel administration order prevent severe hypersensitivity reaction ( HSR ) . Such premedication may consist : dexamethasone 20 mg orally administer approximately 12 6 hour paclitaxel docetaxel ; diphenhydramine 50 mg intravenously cimetidine ( 300 mg ) ranitidine ( 50 mg ) intravenously 30 minute paclitaxel . In case pemetrexed , patient receive injection vitamin B-12 1,000 mcg IM week prior start therapy well folic acid 1 mg po daily week pemetrexed infusion entire course treatment antifolate agent . The dosage toxicity chemotherapy agent well described clinical setting , patient manage patient receive standard chemotherapy . Part B . Targeted therapy use 5-azacitidine . If patient decides receive adjuvant chemotherapy , patient still enrol study , patient understands concept chemoprevention consent blood sample 5-azacitidine administration follow-up ( informed consent sign ) . This part study consist 6 cycle 5-azacitidine ( Vidaza® , Celgene , Summit , NJ , USA ) . Four week completion adjuvant chemotherapy ( day 28 day 1 last cycle chemotherapy ) , patient continue his/her treatment plan 6 cycle 5-azacitidine . To eligible part study , patient must evidence disease ( NED ) . Thus , patient assess CT scan chest/abdomen/pelvis without intravenous contrast prior initiate Part B . In case iodine allergy/anaphylaxis history , patient assess MRI . Progression disease define RECIST criterion . Patient receive 5-azacitidine dose 75 mg/m2 intravenously daily day 1-5 every 28 day 6 cycle . Biological correlative perform period . Toxicity management describe section 6.0 . The use growth factor support ( either erythropoietin stimulate agent G-CSF ) also allow discretion treat physician . Anatomical Studies : All patient surgical resection primary tumor . Pieces resect tumor non-tumor lung tissue require pathological evaluation frozen optimum temperature compound ( OTC ) save molecular analysis . As part enrollment process , patient assess CT scan chest/abdomen/pelvis without intravenous contrast MRI case contraindication iodine contrast , prior initiate Part B treatment ( confirm clinically radiological `` evidence disease-NED '' ) . Another assessment perform 4 week last dose 5-azacitidine ( confirm NED status ) . Patient clinically follow every 3 month completion 2 year post-treatment . Imaging test perform every 3 month CT scan part standard follow-up completion 2 year post-surgery . After 2 year post-treatment completion , patient follow every 6 month clinic also radiographic study completion 5 year post-treatment . In case clinical suspicion progression , patient undergo thorough complete work-up rule possibility . This may include image diagnostic test , biopsy , test procedure . Biological Correlatives : The premise study certain locus hypermethylated lung cancer specimen patient . For locus ( shall call Type I ) tumor show significantly elevate methylation compare adjacent histologically normal tissue , thus provide cancer-specific methylation signal . Other locus ( refer Type II ) may methylated tumor well adjacent `` histologically '' normal tissue and/or WBCs . These loci cancer-specific marker , though may indicate precancerous change may indicative `` cancer risk '' . Their hypermethylation may age-associated environmentally induce , yield `` field effect '' `` field defect '' . Field defect would consist molecular alteration ( case hypermethylation ) yet visible histological change . Independent whether hypermethylated locus specific overt cancer ( Type I ) ( Type II ) , would interest study . These Type II change would `` hypothesis generate '' . Since well document literature DNA cell shed blood stream ( case cancer patient ) , would expect least loci hypermethylated ( Type I II ) , methylation would detectable plasma . Tumor tissue methylation correlate serum obtain time tumor resection . It might expect complete resection would lead reduction complete disappearance methylation signal Type I loci plasma , since source signal remove . Type II also show methylation tissue adjacent tumor , locus might continue provide signal plasma ( though may somewhat diminish ) . Type I loci would therefore great use verify complete resection monitor recurrence ( one would anticipate signal increase cancer grow back ) , Type II locus would great tool monitor efficacy demethylating drug . It must acknowledge spectrum Type I Type II methylation may sharply delineate .</detailed_description>
