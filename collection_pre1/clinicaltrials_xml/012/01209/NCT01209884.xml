	<brief_summary>This research do learn healthy age . We hope learn bodily process function important elderly maintain good health . Metabolites ( example , glucose ) small molecule body use bodily reaction . Looking level healthy elderly people may help researcher find process lead people get disease others . Metabolites basic building block people . They use construct large complex ( protein ) , relay signal one part body another , source energy . While people essentially type metabolite , relative level metabolite vary one individual another . These level reflect body 's state growth , development , reproduction . An appropriate balance metabolite important maintain general health . Conditions like cancer diabetes result disrupt level metabolite associate change bodily function . Deviations normal level metabolite use signature disease . Researchers discover disruption unique metabolite level associate human age . In study hope learn , , disruption associate onset age-related disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolomics Aging : Sub-study Healthy Elderly Active Longevity ( HEAL ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HEAL study criterion include subject 80 year age old experience chronic condition . This sub-study use plasma sample 100 HEAL subject compare metabolomic finding find within group exist young elderly plasma sample currently analysis Siuzdak lab . The aim sub-study determine metabolite downregulated elderly relative young individual similarly downregulated Wellderly . Metabolomics rapidly emerge field focus profile small , naturally occur ( endogenous ) molecules collectively know `` metabolome . '' Metabolomics offer significant advantage `` omics '' science ( e.g. , transcriptomics proteomics ) metabolites represent downstream end product cellular reaction therefore closely correlate phenotype . Thus , comparative untargeted profiling , metabolomics provide powerful strategy understanding change associate unique phenotype molecular level . Untargeted metabolomics denotes profile low molecular weight biochemicals , include lipid , hormone , saccharide , nucleotide , organic acid , amino acid serve substrate product metabolic pathway . The analytes measure without specifically `` target '' distinct metabolites molecule . Untargeted metabolomics capacity implicate unanticipated metabolite pathway associate unique phenotype ( i.e. , advanced age ) , thereby provide great insight cellular mechanism pathobiology . In latter context , Siuzdak Laboratory pioneer new approach investigate disease know therapeutic metabolomics cellular pathway associate disease identify perturbed .</detailed_description>
