	<criteria>A diagnosis liposarcoma confirm MSKCC . Because myxoid / round cell liposarcoma significant CDK4 amplification , patient subtype eligible . Metastatic and/or locally advance locally recurrent disease surgically resectable , evidence disease progression , either clinically radiographically , determine investigator All patient must measurable disease define RECIST 1.1 . Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) . Each lesion must &gt; 10 mm measure CT , MRI caliper measurement clinical exam ; &gt; 20 mm measure chest xray . Lymph node must &gt; 15 mm short axis measure CT MRI . A minimum 1 prior systemic regimen recurrent/metastatic disease . Note : This requirement apply patient enrolled Expansion Cohort . The last dose systemic therapy ( include target therapy ) must give least 2 week prior initiation therapy . Patients receive BCNU mitomycin C must receive last dose therapy least 6 week prior initiation therapy . Patients brain metastasis treat definitive surgery radiation clinically stable 3 month eligible . Age &gt; = 18 year . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Adequate organ marrow function define ( ULN indicate institutional upper limit normal ) : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5x109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL WBC ≥ 3.0x109/L Platelets ≥ 100x109/L Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN except patient know Gilbert syndrome AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 x institutional ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Creatinine Clearance &gt; 50 mL/min ( calculate CockcroftGault method ) QTc interval ≤ 470 msec Patients must current evidence another malignancy require treatment . The effect Palbociclib develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) . Women must breast feed study . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Ability swallow intact Palbociclib capsule . Patients‟ tumor must express Rb , assess use historical biopsy sample available newly obtain tumor sample . Samples must demonstrate ≥1+ stain Rb . Patients ' tumor must also evidence CDK4 amplification FISH . Note : This apply patient enrolled Expansion Cohort . Patients recover adverse event prior therapy ≤ NCI CTCAEv4.0 Grade 1 . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients receive prior treatment selective CDK4 inhibitor History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Palbociclib . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , know ongoing active infection , include HIV , active hepatitis B C , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia ( specifically , atrial fibrillation ventricular dysrhythmias except ventricular premature contraction ) , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman woman breastfeed . Patients history longQT syndrome document family history longQT syndrome . Patients must remain drug prolong QT interval . Palbociclib substrate CYP3A . Caution exercise dose Palbociclib concurrently CYP3A inducer inhibitor . Furthermore , patient take concurrent medication strong inducers/inhibitors substrates CYP3A4 switch alternative medication minimize potential risk . A list CYP3A4 substrates , inducer and/or inhibitor provide Appendix B . The following medication strong potential interaction allow : indinavir nelfinavir ritonavir clarithromycin itraconazole ketoconazole nefazodone saquinavir telithromycin carbamazepine phenobarbital phenytoin pioglitazone rifabutin rifampin St. John 's wort Troglitazone</criteria>
