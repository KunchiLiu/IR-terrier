	<brief_summary>GSK1325756 potent , competitive , selective reversible CXCR2 receptor antagonist develop once-daily oral anti-inflammatory medication treatment chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Selective antagonism interaction CXCR2 various chemokine ligands potential strategy reduce underlying inflammation COPD via inhibition neutrophil recruitment activation . The current study explores effect age , gender food ( high fat meal ) pharmacokinetics GSK1325756 . Because significant proportion COPD subject prescribe proton pump inhibitor ( PPI 's ) omeprazole order alleviate symptom gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , important understand absorption current formulation GSK1325756 environment raise intra-gastric pH encounter patient take PPI 's . Therefore , study also evaluate impact proton pump inhibitor omeprazole pharmacokinetics GSK1325756 .</brief_summary>
