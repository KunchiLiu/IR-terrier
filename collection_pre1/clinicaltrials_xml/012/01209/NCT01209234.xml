	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled trial compare strategy reduce risk methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) infection re-hospitalization MRSA carrier . This trial provide critical answer role decolonization versus standard-of-care education prevent MRSA infection large group high risk MRSA+ patient discharge hospital . Findings could potentially impact best practice 1.8 million MRSA carrier discharge US hospital year . Specific Aims : Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) arguably important single pathogen healthcare-associated infection accounting virulence , prevalence , diversity disease spectrum , propensity widespread transmission . MRSA infection cause complicate 300,000 hospitalization year [ Klein , Smith , Laxminarayan ] , number double past five year . An additional 1.5 million hospitalized patient either acquire already harbor pathogen without current infection . Altogether , 1.8 million MRSA inpatient carrier experience high amount MRSA invasive disease year follow discharge . Due increase delivery complex medical care home post-hospital setting , patient experience serious healthcare-associated morbidity hospital discharge . [ Huang , Platt ; Huang , Hinrichsen , Stulgis et al . ] In fact , 80 % patient admit MRSA infection prior healthcare exposure high risk repeat MRSA infection . [ Huang , Platt ; Huang , Hinrichsen , Stulgis et al . ; Klevens , Morrison , Nadle , et al . ] Project CLEAR compare two strategy reduce infection re-hospitalization due MRSA among patient discharge hospital . Our trial compare long-term regimen aim eradicate MRSA body reservoirs patient education general hygiene self care , current standard care . Our specific aim : - To conduct randomize controlled trial serial decolonization versus standard-of-care patient education among MRSA carrier upon hospital discharge reduce post-discharge MRSA infection re-hospitalization one year - To identify predictor ) infection re-hospitalization due MRSA , b ) successful MRSA decolonization , include patient demographic , comorbidities , medical device , risk behavior , socioeconomic status , colonize MRSA genotype - To estimate medical non-medical cost MRSA infection among MRSA carrier evaluate potential cost saving associate decolonization</detailed_description>
