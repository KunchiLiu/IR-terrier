	<brief_title>Corrected QT ( QTc ) Study With Flucticasone Furoate GW642444</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomise , placebo control , four way crossover thorough QT study evaluate effect repeat dose fluticasone furoate/GW642444M combination QTc interval healthy male female subject . Up 85 subject receive inhale placebo inhale fluticasone furoate/GW642444M combination ( 200/25 microgram ( mcg ) 800/100 mcg ) oral moxifloxacin ( 400 milligram ( mg ) ) . The inhaled treatment give double-blind daily morning 7 day single-blind placebo tablet also administer Day 7 . Moxifloxacin ( positive control ) give single-blind single dose Day 7 morning inhale double-blind placebo administer morning Days 1-7 . Individual time-matched change baseline QT duration correct heart rate Fredericia 's formula ( QTcF ) ( difference placebo ) fluticasone furoate/GW642444M 200/25mcg determine 0-24 hour ( h ) dose Day 7 ( primary endpoint ) . Secondary endpoint include change baseline QTcF , QT individual correction factor ( QTci ) , QT duration correct heart rate Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) , QT interval timepoint 7 day dose fluticasone furoate/GW642444M 800/100mcg single dose oral moxifloxacin ( 400mg ) change baseline QTci , QTcB , QT interval timepoint 7 day dose fluticasone furoate/GW642444M 200/25mcg . Plasma concentration ( 0-24h ) pharmacokinetic parameter GW642444 fluticasone furoate also derive .</detailed_description>
