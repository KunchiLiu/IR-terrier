	<brief_title>Autologous Bone Marrow-Derived Mononuclear Cell Transplantation Accelerating Tissue Expansion Skin Regeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reconstruction large scale skin defect challenge clinical surgeon . Soft tissue expansion wide attention recent year promote skin regeneration perfectly match tissue . However , patient poor skin regenerative ability would suffer skin flap over-thinned even necrosis continuous stretch silicone expander . Although , occasion , decelerate expander inflation process could reduce incidence necrosis , prolong therapy circle accompany increased complication , include infection expander rupture , well increased economic expense long hospitalization . This study observe effect autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell transplantation accelerate skin regeneration promote tissue expansion process . Patients age 18 60 year old appear deteriorate expanded skin enrol randomize two group , name experimental group control group . Patients experimental group bone marrow aspiration intradermal mononuclear cell transplantation . On side , Patients control group saline injection .</detailed_description>
