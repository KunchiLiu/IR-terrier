	<brief_summary>Inpatients neurology rehabilitation unit Riverview Health Center― people brain-injured stroke ― often dysphagia result condition . They consider high risk aspiration , result pneumonia . To limit risk , patient allow consume thickened liquid begin rehabilitation . They restrict consume thin liquid , mean ca n't even drink water . Depending rate rehabilitation , restriction last six month year . Patients diet thickened liquid sometimes difficulty consume require daily intake fluid become dehydrated , turn lead health complication . As well , thicken liquid always satisfy patient 's thirst , say Pooyania . While Riverview allow inpatient dyspagia water begin rehabilitation , many rehab facility Canada U.S. follow `` Frazier Free Water Protocol , '' allow patient unrestricted water intake prior 30 minute meal . The belief protocol safe base research do Frazier Rehabilitation Institute , study demonstrate difference rate aspiration pneumonia experimental group free water protocol control group . The Frazer study one randomize control trial limited number patient . There case report well , Riverview centre , protocol accept investigator n't believe enough evidence behind . The investigator intend provide clinical evidence risk benefit free water protocol assess . The investigator screen patient admitted neurology rehabilitation unit RCH , include stroke acquire brain injury program . The investigator expect find least 30 suitable candidate . Participants educate dysphagia free water protocol , treatment group allow unrestricted water intake prior 30 minute meal . Individualized intervention minimize aspiration provide . Daily weekly monitoring test patient take place . The pilot study continue 11 month . A secondary objective research determine feasibility expand multi-centre clinical trial</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Free Water Protocol Inpatients Neurological Rehabilitation Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research determine impact free water protocol inpatient neurological rehabilitation set extremely relevant patient population Riverview Health Centre ( RHC ) , many patient RHC receive modify diet consist thickened liquid . To date , research base use free water protocol limit . Despite general lack research evidence , modify version free water protocol adopt numerous facility across North America . Pursuing clinical research measure effect free water protocol rate aspiration pneumonia , quality life relate swallowing , fluid intake , hydration level , would provide research evidence help guide patient care . If research show free water protocol could use without increased risk patient dysphagia , patient population Riverview , rehabilitation center , could benefit .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patient admit thin fluid restriction Stroke Acquired Brain Injury Units Riverview Health Centre duration study consider eligibility . Exclusion criterion include follow : history severe pulmonary complication , individual demonstrate severe cough point discomfort medical complication consume thin fluid , individual immune deficiency problem severe cognitive impairment would affect patient 's ability sign consent form follow protocol .</criteria>
