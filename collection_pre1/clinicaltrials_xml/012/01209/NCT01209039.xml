A positive test result antibody human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) 1/2 . Significant renal abnormality ( medical history indicate laboratory investigation . In addition , subject idiopathic haematuria proteinuria condition benign orthostatic proteinuria benign familial haematuria exclude study ) . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study start define : An average weekly intake great 21 unit average daily intake great 3 unit ( male ) , defined average weekly intake great 14 unit average daily intake great 2 unit ( female ) . One unit equivalent half pint ( 220 mL ) beer 1 measure ( 25 mL ) spirit 1 glass ( 125 mL ) wine . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within 3 month prior first investigational product dose day current study . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first investigational product dose day . Use prescription non prescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 half life ( whichever longer ) prior receive first dose investigational product , unless opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . History sensitivity investigational product , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation study . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 600 mL within 56 day period . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol .
