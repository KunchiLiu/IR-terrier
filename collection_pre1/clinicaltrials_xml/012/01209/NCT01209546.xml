	<detailed_description>Bronchiectasis airway disease many etiology characterize pathologically abnormal permanent dilatation bronchus , cause mainly perpetuation inflammatory process induce frequent episode bacterial infection , consequent change ciliated epithelial lining compromise effectiveness mucociliary clearance favor hypersecretive state find patient . In addition drug therapy surgical treatment , patient bronchiectasis also physiotherapy , important part treatment . The patient present impaired mucus transport , enjoy benefit provide respiratory therapy , feature intend increase removal airway secretion thus reduce obstruction improve ventilation oxygenation . One instrument commonly use respiratory therapy Flutter ® VRP1 ( VarioRaw SA , Switzerland ) , simple equipment , small , similar pipe combine two technique : positive expiratory pressure ( PEP ) high-frequency oscillation . Some previous study show beneficial effect use device patient bronchiectasis . However , unclear whether mechanism action relate combination PEP techniques high frequency oscillation , one component .</detailed_description>
