	<brief_title>Immunotherapy Asymptomatic Phase Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Vaccine : The cancer vaccine use study make DNA ( genetic material cell ) . The vaccine design increase immune system 's ability react lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma . Making Vaccine : About 12 month need make vaccine tumor . Although lot effort use try make vaccine participant , researcher always successful . Researchers guarantee receive vaccine . Baseline Procedures : The following test procedure perform within 4 week start vaccine : - Your medical history record ( +/- 2 day ) . - You physical exam ( +/- 2 day ) . - You ask drug may take . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) collect routine test . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test woman able become pregnant . To take part study , must pregnant . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect check status disease . This urine collect 24-hour period . You provide container urine collection . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level base start study . If one first 3 participant , receive low dose vaccine . If dose level find safe , participant receive high dose vaccine . Once vaccine ready ( 12 month ) , may receive 3 vaccine , give one month apart . The vaccine give use needle free injection device work deliver vaccine skin . Each dose vaccine split 5 separate injection . You longer able take vaccine disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Your participation study complete 1 year last vaccination . Study Visits : During study , follow test procedure perform . These test procedure part regular cancer care ; however , do often study . In 7 day first vaccine , doctor think need , may CT scan check status disease . Within 2 day vaccine : - Blood ( 5 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect check status disease . This urine collect 24-hour period . You provide container urine collection . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check immune system disorder . On day receive vaccine : - You physical exam . - You ask feel . - You ask drug may take . At 4 8 week , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check immune system respond vaccine . At 4 week last vaccination : - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw check immune system respond vaccine . - You bone marrow aspiration check status disease . About 4 week last vaccination , every 2 month 1 year : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam . - You ask feel . - You ask drug may take . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect check status disease . This urine collect 24-hour period . You provide container urine collection . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check immune system disorder . About 4 month last vaccination , every 4 month 1 year , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw check immune system respond vaccine . About 4 week last vaccination , every 6 month 1 year , CT scan check status disease . This investigational study . The vaccine FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 12 patient take part study . All patient enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
