	<brief_summary>At time , 24h energy expenditure rarely assess free-living condition specific individual lack cheap accurate software/materials record energy expenditure . Some affordable convenient tool ( Polar heart rate monitor , Actiheart , SenseWear Armband ) available market predictive equation comprise software provide tool generally miscalculate energy expenditure ( +/-10 % ) . Because deficiency , investigator poor knowledge modification energy expend daily life activity 24h subject belong group various age physiological state . The investigator hypothesise could possible improve energy expenditure prediction . The project aim provide mathematical model ( equation ) predict energy expenditure error near 5 % . Two group 60 sedentary athletic normal weight volunteer age 18-60 year participate study . The first group stay 26h calorimetric chamber . During stay energy expenditure , heart rate , accelerometry , parameter record various activity . These data serve construct model . The type recording perform second group volunteer free live condition . Their energy expenditure measure overall doubly label water . The data second group serve validate model . The error percentage model define ratio value difference prediction reference measure reference measure . Concordance prediction measure evaluate Bland - Altman plot .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All volunteer visit inclusion Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine . During visit , volunteer inform method protocol , take sample , disadvantage constraint , basis information letter . They medical interrogation complete clinical examination investigatory doctor Co-investigator . The biological assessment require 10 ml blood include : analysis TSH , blood count , sedimentation test . Moreover , woman age procreate , analysis beta - HCG make . To take another blood sample ( 10 ml ) necessary realization serology HIV/HCV volunteer group doubly label water , provide sample urine saliva . The result communicate volunteer confidentially . Following visit inclusion signature consent form , food consumption survey perform evaluate energy intake volunteer . Moreover , body composition level physical-activity volunteer evaluate biphotonic absorptiometry ( DEXA ) use questionnaire MAQ ( Modifiable Activity Questionnaire , translate adapted Vuillemin Al , 1999 ) , respectively . The volunteer first group ( 60 ) perform maximal aerobic power test ergocycle evaluate maximum aerobic physical capacity ( VO2max ) , hospital laboratory . A measurement body composition biphotonic absorptiometry also carry determine lean fat mass . Then , volunteer stay 26 hour calorimetric room ( one evening , one night day ) . The data indirect calorimetry ( O2 consumption production CO2 ) , heart rate , actimetry parameter take account midnight . After one night sleep , individual carry series state exercise simulate daily physical-activities ( sleep , write 15 min , standing-sitting 5 min , stand 15 min , stroll 15 min , rest 20 min , eat 20 min , household 20 min , stepper 20 min , walk treadmill increase speed 3 km/h , 4 km/h , 5 km/h 6 km/h 20 minute ) . The volunteer also answer questionnaire perception hunger , emotional state visual appreciation 6 food product 5 time day ( breakfast , lunch 16:30 pm ) . The rest time , activity free ( watch TV , reading , listen radio … ) . Measurements finish towards 18:00 volunteer go home . The meal balance proteins/glucides/lipids cover energy need . The menu establish dietician . The meal calorimetric room prepare double weigh make possible calculate actual quantity . The second group volunteer ( 60 ) follow protocol doubly label water evaluate energy expenditure 10 day free living condition . For period , heart rate , parameter actimetry parameter record . The participant second group also answer questionnaire perception hunger , emotional state visual appreciation 6 food product , one day home . The physical data record second group introduce predictive equation . The estimated energy expenditure compare energy expenditure measure technique doubly label water . The answer questionnaire fill volunteer two group also compare .</detailed_description>
