	<brief_summary>The objective trial evaluate postoperative intermediate care versus ward care patient undergone emergency abdominal surgery perioperative Acute Physiology Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE ) II score ≥ 10 ( high risk patient ) . Patients enrol trial , ready discharge recovery unit intensive/intermediate care unit surgical ward within 24 hour surgery . Discharge criterion accord Danish national recommendation . The intermediate care bed trial define certain minimum requirement patient observation describe treatment possibility available intermediate bed . If treatment exceed treatment possibility , patient classify intensive care patient . The intermediate care bed place intensive care unit , recovery unit surgical high dependency unit . If available intermediate care bed , patient randomize , register `` exclude available intermediate care bed '' . Hypothesis : Postoperative intermediate care 48 hour reduce 30-day mortality emergency abdominal surgery patient high risk postoperative organ failure . Interim analysis : An independent Data Monitoring Safety Committee ( DMSC ) conduct interim analysis base analysis primary outcome blind intervention allocation . The DMSC use P &lt; 0.001 ( Haybittle-Peto ) two subsequent interim analyse statistical limit guide recommendation regard early termination trial benefit harm . The first interim analysis conduct 30 day follow-up data 50 % ( i.e. , 200 patient ) trial participant obtain and/or 75 death document trial . If P &lt; 0,001 first interim analysis second interim analysis conduct 30 day follow-up data 75 % ( i.e. , 300 patient ) trial participant obtain and/or 25 death document trial . Trial terminate 30th November 2012 . The Data Monitor Committee find low overall event rate primary outcome first interim-analysis compare pre-trial estimate . This preclude possibility detect reject anticipate relative risk reduction 34 % use sample size estimation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Like Denmark , many European country limit access surgical intermediate care bed ( high dependency bed ) . This may reflect lack scientific evidence effect intermediate care combine restrict healthcare resource . Better access dedicate postoperative intensive/intermediate care facility suggest factor potentially reduce postoperative complication rate mortality high risk surgical patient . The Incare Trial provide important data effect postoperative intermediate care emergency abdominal surgery patient .</detailed_description>
