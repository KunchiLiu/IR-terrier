	<brief_title>First Time Human Study With GSK1325756</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) single repeat oral dos GSK1325756 healthy , male volunteer subject , include assessment effect GSK1325756 ex vivo ' C-X-C Motif Ligand 1 ' ( CXCL1 ) -induced 'Cluster Differentiation 11b ' ( CD11b ) cell surface expression peripheral blood neutrophil . Selective antagonism interaction ' C-X-C Receptor Type 2 ' ( CXCR2 ) various chemokine ligand provide potential strategy reduce underlying inflammation contributes progression Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . This study first administration GSK1325756 human conduct four cohort . Cohorts 1 2 comprise double-blind , placebo-controlled , single dose escalation GSK132576 healthy adult male two interlock cohort . The data generate single dose escalation component study ( safety , tolerability , applicable , PK profile , , available , PD data ) enable decision regard progression one dose next high dose later within Cohorts 1 2 . This data also review decision regard study progression repeat dose Cohorts 3 4 , suitable dos GSK1325756 select repeat dose cohort .</detailed_description>
