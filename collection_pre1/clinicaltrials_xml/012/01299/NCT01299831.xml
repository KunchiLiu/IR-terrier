	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate signal pathway fat muscle , well turnover protein , sugar fat stimulation growth hormone fast lean obese subject . This help clarify difference human metabolism lean obese subject provide u good understand molecular mechanism regulate basic metabolism prolong fasting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In evolutionary context , likely `` inherit '' obesity provide survival advantage shortage food , also increase risk lifestyle diseases time prosperity . This may explain high incidence obesity , diabetes cardiovascular disease western world today . Obese individual high level free fatty acid ( FFAs ) blood FFAs protein spar ( give evolutionary survival advantage ) also cause increased insulin resistance ( increase risk diabetes cardiovascular disease ) . Obesity also lead low growth hormone ( GH ) -levels , whereas fast accompanied high GH- FFA-levels increase IGF-I mRNA muscle . It likely obese individual capable fast lean individual lose less protein fasting , increase activation GH signaling alter activation signal protein . And obese individual likely sensitive growth hormone lean individual base FFA-responses , intracellular signaling , protein loss insulin sensitivity . We would like test 3 hypothesis : ( 1 ) Obese individual capable fast lean individual lose less protein fasting ( 2 ) Activation lipolysis important prerequisite limit protein loss fast slim obese individual . ( 3 ) Obese individual sensitive growth hormone lean individual base FFA response activation intracellular signal . The hypothesis test 8 lean 8 obese healthy young men , study 4 time : ( ) 12 hour fast ( ii ) 72 hour fast ( iii ) GH-bolus ( 0.005 mg/kg 20 min . ) ( iv ) 72 hour fast inhibition fat metabolism ( tablet acipimox 250 mg every 4 hour ) last 12 hour fast study period . Each study period consist 4-hour basal period 2 hour hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp ( 30 mU/m2/min ) . Muscle- fat-biopsies take analyzed enzyme expression activation various signal pathway . The study subject give glucose- , amino acid- , urea- palmitate-tracers specific hormone metabolite measure assessment underlie molecular mechanism regulate basic human energy metabolism .</detailed_description>
