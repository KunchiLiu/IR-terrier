	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) one cancer community partner identify priority . It second lead cause cancer death United States , one significant disparity screen , stage diagnosis , survival . Underinsured uninsured adult less likely screen , likely cancer diagnose late stage , less likely survive CRC . In project work `` safety-net '' health center serve Medicaid uninsured patient St. Louis City St. Louis County Missouri , East St. Louis/St . Clair County Illinois . Working Colorectal Cancer Community Partnership plan cluster-randomized delayed start trial test effectiveness offer community health center `` Menu '' evidence-based system intervention increase rate CRC screening .

The control condition usual care , concordance partner ' wish , offer participate health center access state-of-the-art evidence-based patient education material . The primary outcome CRC screen adherence measure self-report survey random sample health center patient . Our evaluation also inform chart audit ass screen referral completion , survey physicians staff intervention sit assess implementation outcome , exit interview administration intervention health center assess maintenance intervention strategy . We develop conduct study adhere principle community-based participatory research ( CBPR ) . The specific aim : ( 1 ) Working community partner , select refine evidence-based intervention strategy trial ; ( 2 ) Using CBPR approach , collaborate partner implement evaluate systems-level intervention effectiveness increase CRC screen rate . ( 3 ) Using RE-AIM framework , work partner evaluate implementation maintenance system change intervention health center adoption change control center . Compared traditional clinic healthcare provider , safety-net health center face additional challenge implement evidence-based strategy increase screen uptake ; yet rigorously test strategy context novel . Allowing health center select menu strategy provide practical test effectiveness , increase buy-in representativeness participate health center . As practical clinical trial good external validity , project potential significant impact CRC screen rate promise substantial impact disparity CRC burden . This study responsive community concern CRC no-intervention control group , responsive RFA propose CBPR randomize control trial increase access utilization CRC screening procedure .</detailed_description>
