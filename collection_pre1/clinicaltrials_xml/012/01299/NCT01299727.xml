	<brief_summary>Sanfilippo syndrome , Mucopolysaccharidosis ( MPS ) III , rare lysosomal storage disease ( LSD ) cause loss activity 1 9 enzyme necessary degradation glycosaminoglycan ( GAG ) heparan sulfate ( HS ) lysosomes . MPS IIIA result deficiency enzyme heparan N-sulfatase ( sulfamidase ) . In absence enzyme , intermediate HS degradation process accumulate lysosome neuron glial cell , less accumulation outside brain . MPS IIIA symptom arise average 7 month age , average age diagnosis 4.5 year majority patient . Patients present wide spectrum severity clinical symptom . The central nervous system ( CNS ) severely affect organ system patient MPS IIIA , evidence deficit language development , motor skill , intellectual development . In addition , abnormal behavior include limited aggression excess motor activity/hyperactivity contribute disturbance sleep.Overall , individual MPS IIIA mark developmental delay significantly reduce lifespan 15 year age average . The purpose study collect long term safety tolerability data patient MPS IIIA previously receive rhHNS study HGT-SAN-055 ( NCT01155778 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extension Study HGT-SAN-055 Evaluating Administration rhHNS Patients With Sanfilippo Syndrome Type A ( MPS IIIA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>No effective , disease-modifying therapy currently approve treatment devastate disable disease . Shire Human Genetic Therapies ( Shire HGT ) develop sulfamidase enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) rhHNS patient MPS IIIA . rhHNS administer cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) via surgically implanted intrathecal drug delivery device ( IDDD ) , administer intravenously ( IV ) cross blood brain barrier ( BBB ) . This multicenter study design collect long-term safety tolerability data patient Sanfilippo Syndrome Type A ( MPS IIIA ) receive rhHNS via surgically implanted intrathecal drug delivery device ( IDDD ) study HGT-SAN-055 elect continue therapy.Patients continue treatment group participate HGT-SAN-055 study ( rhHNS administer IT injection 10 mg per month , 45 mg per month 90 mg per month . The study duration maximum duration 8 year rhHNS treatment rhHNS commercially available , patient discontinues study , Sponsor stop study , Sponsor discontinue development rhHNS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must meet follow criterion consider eligible enrollment : 1 . The patient must complete Study HGT SAN 055 opinion investigator , safety medical issue contraindicate participation . 2 . The patient , patient 's parent ( ) , legally authorize representative ( ) voluntarily sign Institutional Review Board / Independent Ethics Committeeapproved inform consent form relevant aspect study explain discussed patient 's , patient 's , patient 's parent legally authorize representative 's consent patient 's assent , appropriate , must obtain prior study specific procedure . 3 . The patient receive least 5 6 planned infusion rhHNS HGTSAN055 study . 4 . Patients must medically stable , opinion Investigator , accommodate protocol requirement , include travel , assessment , IDDD surgery ( necessary replacement purpose ) , without place undue burden patient/patient 's family . Subjects exclude study evidence follow criterion screen anytime study : 1 . The patient experience adverse reaction study drug Study HGTSAN55 contraindicate treatment rhHNS . 2 . The patient know hypersensitivity active ingredient excipients rhHNS drug product . 3 . The patient significant nonMPS IIIA related central nervous system ( CNS ) impairment behavioral disturbance would confound scientific integrity interpretation study assessment , determine Investigator . 4 . The patient significant MPS IIIA behavioralrelated issue , determine Investigator , would preclude performance study neurocognitive developmental testing procedure . 5 . The patient pregnant , breast feeding , female patient childbearing potential , comply use acceptable method birth control , condom , barrier method , oral contraception , etc . 6 . The patient know suspected hypersensitivity anesthesia think unacceptably high risk anesthesia due airway compromise condition . 7 . The patient history poorly control seizure disorder . 8 . The patient currently receive psychotropic medication , Investigator 's opinion , would likely substantially confound test result dose regimen keep constant throughout study . 9 . The patient sustain absence aspirin , nonsteroidal medication , medication affect blood clotting within 1 week prior relevant studyrelated procedure ( eg , device reimplantation applicable ) , ingested medication within 1 week procedure change clot activity would deleterious . 10 . The patient receive treatment investigational drug ( rhHNS ) intend treatment MPS IIIA within 30 day prior , study , currently enrol another study involve investigational drug device ( screen safety followup contact ) . 11 . The patient receive hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow transplant .</criteria>
