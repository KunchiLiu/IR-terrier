This illustrated high prevalence fibromyalgia observe patient rheumatoid arthritis , osteoarthritis ankylose spondylitis example . These pain condition understood combination peripheral , neuropathic central pain . The investigator aim focus study patient candidate spinal surgery suffer low back pain and/or radiculopathy . Pain patient may arise damage nerve - neuropathic pain- , musculoskeletal structure - peripheral pain- , may also reflect alteration central pain process . In patient , spine surgery usually perform improve quality life , decrease pain avoid neurological deficit . Evaluation surgical outcome include objective measure neurological finding radiographic evaluation , subjective measure include patient self-assessments pain quality life psychological change . The aim study evaluate patient undergo spinal surgery presence central pain central sensitization symptom evaluate influence surgical outcome</brief_summary>
