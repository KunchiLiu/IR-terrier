	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - To evaluate liothyronine ( Cytomel ) accelerate agent ( i.e . faster rate clinical remission ) electroconvulsive therapy . - To evaluate whether thyroid supplement acceleration reduce neurocognitive side effect ECT treatment . - To evaluate whether thyroid status time remission associate subsequent relapse rate . - To evaluate genetic polymorphism enzymes responsible thyroid metabolism serotonin transporter promoter gene depression ( 5-HTTLRP ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acceleration Relapse Prevention With Triiodothyronine ( T3 ) Adjunct Electroconvulsive Therapy ( ECT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-site , randomize , placebo-controlled trial concurrent triiodothyronine ( Cytomel® 25-50 mcg/d ) electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) patient major depressive episode refer ECT . Goals application : 1 ) evaluate whether thyroid status time sustain clinical response associate subsequent relapse rate , 2 ) evaluate triiodothyronine ( Cytomel® ) accelerate agent ( i.e . faster rate sustain clinical response ) electroconvulsive ECT treatment , 3 ) evaluate whether thyroid acceleration reduce neurocognitive side effect ECT . 4 ) To evaluate genetic polymorphism enzymes responsible thyroid metabolism serotonin transporter promoter gene depression ( 5-HTTLRP ) . The primary outcome measure study , time relapse , define Hamilton Depression Score ( HAMD-24 ) ≥16 increase ≥10 point sustain response baseline . Secondary outcome measure time sustain response , define ≥60 % reduction HAMD-24 score , neurocognitive side effect burden rat modified Mini Mental Status Examination time sustain clinical response . Hypotheses : 1 . Within 6-month study period , mean serum free T3 time sustain clinical response correlate time subsequent relapse [ define HAMD-24 score ≥16 increase ≥10 point baseline ( sustain response ) ] . 2 . In comparison placebo , triiodothyronine ( Cytomel® , 25-50 mcg ) accelerate time sustain clinical response [ define ≥60 % reduction Hamilton Rating Scale Depression , 24-item , ( HAMD-24 ) score HAMD-24 total score ≤10 2 consecutive visit ] depressed patient refer ECT . 3 . In comparison placebo , time sustain clinical response , less ECT-related neurocognitive side effect , rat modify Mini-Mental Status Examination ( mMMSE ) , associate triiodothyronine . 4. . The 5-HTTLPR long allele ( l ) ( l ) / ( l ) genotype associate faster treatment response . b . The DI-C785T allele associate low T3 level baseline faster treatment response .</detailed_description>
