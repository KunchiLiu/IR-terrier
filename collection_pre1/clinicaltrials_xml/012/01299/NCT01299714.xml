	<detailed_description>A quadrivalent HPV 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 vaccine ( GARDASIL® ) approve use among woman age 9-26 year prevent cervical/vaginal/vulvar cancer genital wart . The efficacy vaccine demonstrate clinical trial setting , effectiveness vaccine test clinical practice setting . Patients experience great stress reduce capacity mount immune response type vaccine . The phenomenon likely exist Gardasil , data . The impact psychological stress immune response vaccine propose act via health behavior ( multiple lifetime sexual partner , never use condom , prior abnormal Pap smear , smoking , HPV infection ) direct dysregulation immune system . We find high rate cervical HPV Appalachian Ohio woman , high rate abnormal cervical cytology , high rate psychological stress compare urban suburban woman . The goal study determine , woman age 18-26 year give GARDASIL® vaccine , serum HPV 6/11/16/18 antibody response alter stress . This accomplish study 432 woman age 18-26 year report full range life stressor recruit Appalachian Ohio . All participant receive GARDASIL® vaccine baseline , two month , six month . Prior vaccination questionnaire data relate HPV exposure risk behavior psychological stressor collect . Cervical sample collect cytology HPV testing . Serum sample collect HPV 6 , 11 , 16 18 antibody assay baseline month 12 . The questionnaire data serum sample repeat 12 month . The primary outcome measure difference serum antibody HPV 6 , 11 , 16 18 baseline month 12 . The variables interest perceive stress , sexual behavior , socioeconomic status , access health care ( health insurance yes/no ) , smoke , Appalachian self-identity , HPV cervical status baseline , past history abnormal cervical cytology , propose psychoneuroimmunology model . In model , Appalachian Self-Identity , socioeconomic status , loneliness , health care access , cop propose contribute woman 's perceived stress . The impact perceive stress immune response Gardasil vaccination health behavior multiple lifetime sexual partner ( &gt; 4 ) , never use condom , prior abnormal Pap smear , smoking , HPV status time vaccination . Perceived stress direct physiologic impact immune response create immune dysregulation measure increased EBV VCA-IgG titer . Depressive symptoms mediate impact perceive stress immune function . If psychological stress find modulate immune response GARDASIL® , determine modulation reduce clinical effectiveness vaccine examine method limit impact stress .</detailed_description>
