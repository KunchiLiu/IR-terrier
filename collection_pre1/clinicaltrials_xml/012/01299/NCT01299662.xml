	<detailed_description>This protocol take system biology approach understand human major new area vaccine biology : mechanism whereby adjuvant , act define pattern recognition receptor [ PRR ] , enhance T B cell immunity . Our focus synthetic double strand RNA , poly IC RNase resistant form , call poly ICLC , available study human . The PRRs cytosolic helicase , MDA-5 , endosomal toll like receptor , TLR3 . The Steinman lab pioneer mice monkey dsRNA superior adjuvant T cell mediate immunity relative several PRR agonist ( Longhi et al. , 2009 ; Stahl-Hennig et al. , 2009 ) . A major mechanism poly IC superior inducer systemic type I interferon [ IFN ] , turn act type I IFN receptor [ IFNAR ] mature immune stimulatory function dendritic cell [ DCs ] . An adaptive Th1 type T cell response induce , independent IL-12 IFN-g. Multiparameter approach provide mean understand adjuvant action . We hypothesize DCs undergo change adjuvant-specific link innate select form adaptive immunity . Transcriptional array splenic DCs mouse show dsRNA induces massive response ~1000 splenic DC gene change &gt; 2 fold 4 hr . These change drive primarily via type I IFN , produce systemically via MDA-5 non-bone marrow derive cell act DC IFNAR . IFNAR mediate change term `` DC maturation '' acquisition immune stimulating activity , e.g. , high CD86 , CD40 , IL-15 , mechanisms restore homeostasis . In word , IFN rather PRR per se , account bulk poly IC response DCs . In recently complete phase I study ( protocol MAC-682 ) , poly ICLC find safe well tolerate administer single dose 1.6 mg subcutaneously ( s.c. ) intranasally ( i.n . ) healthy volunteer . Preliminary innate immune response data show , similarly preclinical study mice , mark upregulation gene expression whole PBMCs follow s.c injection poly ICLC . At day 1 follow poly ICLC injection , 2,000 gene upregulated ( &gt; 1.3 fold change expression day 1 versus baseline ) responses specific study drug . Importantly , gene change homogenous among 8 volunteer receive poly ICLC . The top upregulated gene interferon-stimulated gene would predict since poly ICLC know induce type I interferon . In addition , gene associate dendritric cell ( DC ) activation CD40 CD86 also upregulated day 1 poly ICLC injection , well gene involve signal pathway IRF 5 , IRF 7 STAT1 . Poly ICLC induce secretion small amount type I II interferon plasma level peak day 2 post injection . Lastly , FACS analysis PBMCs demonstrate poly ICLC induce upregulation activation marker different subset blood dendritic cell . Evaluation later timepoints currently take place analysis sample day 7 show gene involve generation T B cell response upregulated early interferon-stimulated gene trend baseline level expression . These result far show subcutaneous injection poly ICLC lead systemic innate immune response , dominate induction type I interferon . Assays perform whole PBMCs however genetic expression pattern different subset blood leukocyte response poly ICLC remain define . We propose extend analysis systemic immune response poly ICLC characterization transcriptional effect specific FACS sort blood cell type , DCs , monocytes , NK cell well T B cell . By analyze individual cell subset expect good dissect poly ICLC modulate innate immune response turn affect adaptive immune response give combination antigen . Significant regulation interferon gene ( type I IFNs IFN-gamma ) evident gene array analysis whole PBMC 's , despite measurement small amount IFN-alpha IFN-gamma plasma . It may platform use sensitive enough detect regulation IFN gene plan perform RT-PCR verify finding . However , may restrict analysis peripheral blood , miss early event take place follow poly ICLC administration . In order understand poly ICLC activate different cell population , important characterize immunoregulatory effect locally systemically . The cutaneous immune environment particularly amenable PRR ligand modulation evidence imiquimod , act TLR 7 . Indeed , use imiquimod stimulate immune responses infectious agent ( HPV ) malignancy ( squamous basal cell carcinoma ) document . Migratory DCs , traffic skin skin drain LN , show cross prime immune reponses self viral antigen . As , possible skin DCs may migrate skin drain LNs blood follow poly ICLC administration . However analysis blood population alone likely miss window immune alteration event occur locally skin . Analysis genetic expression cellular infiltrate site poly ICLC injection , early ( 6 hour ) skin infiltration evident clinically ( day 1 ) , likely add understand adjuvant effect . Genomic expression profile skin sample successfully use disease classification predict response treatment skin diseases psoriasis squamous cell carcinoma ( Zaba L et al. , 2007 ; Suarez-Farinas et al. , 2010 ) . Analysis genomic expression profile skin poly ICLC may prove useful understand innate immune response initiate PRRs ligands perhaps vaccine adjuvant . Most study poly ICLC human use intramuscular route administration . Subcutaneous administration poly ICLC study extensively protocol MAC-682 first study use route administration healthy volunteer . Following poly ICLC s.c. injection , 8 8 volunteer develop well-defined area erythema , degree induration tenderness . This injection site reaction usually peak day 2 completely resolve day 7 . Histologic data characterize infiltrate available human . However , data available non-human primate . A GLP-compliant toxicology study perform cynomolgus macaque investigate safety anti-DEC-205 ( 3G9 ) - HIV gag p24 ( DCVax-001 ) combination adjuvant Hiltonol ( poly ICLC ) subcutaneously . In study , macaque administer total four dose 10 mg anti-DEC-205-HIV gag p24 antibody combination 2 mg poly ICLC , 10 mg poly ICLC alone placebo , 8 week . With regard reactogenicity ( modify Draize score ) , evidence indicate poly ICLC ( 10 mg ) induce slight transient injection site reaction form erythema ; however , reaction reduce absent repeat dosing , indicate minimal toxicological significance . A number gross lesion include dark area , dark discoloration gelatinous material present recent site administration prior euthanasia , 1 day poly ICLC injection . At least one finding occur animal gender receive 10 mg poly-ICLC . Microscopically , associate hemorrhage and/or presence extracellular intracellular ( within macrophage ) foreign material presume represent predominantly adjuvant/test article . The lesion therefore consider consistent expect local reaction foreign material injection site . Upon recovery ( 4 week injection ) , macroscopic finding relate administration poly-ICLC note . Despite difference skin non-human primate human skin , expect find similar transient cellular infiltration site poly ICLC s.c. injection . In addition role anti tumor viral immunity mention , topical imiquimod use adjuvant combination intradermal NY-ESO-1 protein melanoma patient . This combination induce dermal mononuclear cell infiltrate patient . The infiltrates compose primarily T cell , monocyte , macrophage , myeloid DCs , NK cell , , less extent , plasmacytoid DCs ( Adams et al. , 2008 ) . Poly ICLC however act different PRRs , MDA-5 TLR-3 , likely induces secretion type-I IFNs locally . In situ immunomodulatory effect poly ICLC likely differ effect imiquimod . Combining immunohistochemistry evaluation cellular infiltrates induce poly ICLC along gene array analysis transcriptional effect whole skin injection site may help elucidate local event mechanisms whereby poly ICLC exert adjuvant effect .
