	<brief_title>Study Patients With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma ( STS ) After Failure Anthracyclines and/or Ifosfamide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This phase IV study design evaluate , real-world setting , usage pattern associate outcomes associated anticancer treatment and/or best supportive care clinical practice . The primary study analysis collect clinical data symptomatic best response , include tumor control rate , survival , TTP PFS . Other endpoint study include evaluation on-study subsequent anticancer treatment , QoL evaluation use EORTC QoL test ( QLQ-C30 ) economic cost-effectiveness analysis use EQ-5D test . - The study population consist patient advance soft tissue sarcoma failure anthracyclines and/or ifosfamide patient unsuited receive drug . To enrol study , patient must meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion . Estimated 100 patient enrol . - Inclusion Criteria 1 . Patients sex histologically diagnose advanced soft tissue sarcoma failure anthracyclines and/or ifosfamide patient unsuited receive drug . 2 . Patients must sign informed consent document indicate understand purpose procedure require study , willing participate study . 3 . Age ≥ 18 year . Exclusion Criteria Withdrawal inform consent point study exclude patient study . - Assigned Intervention 1 . Trabectedin treatment The administration chemotherapy regimen trabectedin determine Investigator 's discretion depend patients´ condition previous chemotherapy . 2 . Other conventional care regimen : palliative chemotherapy biological therapy best supportive care . Patients conventional care regimen could receive follow preselected treatment option : A.Palliative chemotherapy biological therapy ( Ifosfamide anticancer agent antitumor effect ) palliative systemic therapeutic modality may offer patient advanced soft tissue sarcoma . B.Best supportive care , palliative therapeutic modality may offer patient soft tissue sarcoma exclude chemotherapy/biological therapy include radiotherapy non-anticancer medication . Hence , include nutritional support , analgesic , antibiotic , antiemetic , transfusion , appetitive stimulant , antidepressant symptomatic therapy , palliative surgery and/or psychological support and/or deep relaxation therapy . Localized radiotherapy alleviate symptom ( i.e. , pain ) allow , provide total delivered dose within palliative range . All therapy potential systemic antitumor effect exclude BSC definition - Subsequent Anticancer Treatments Administered After chemotherapy discontinuation , patient document progressive disease ( PD ) may treat subsequent anticancer therapy best supportive care Investigators´ discretion . All subsequent treatment , surgical procedure radiotherapy report CRF . - The study period start study inclusion continue treatment discontinuation , death predefined date April 2014 , final analysis deliver Dutch authority . - Efficacy Evaluations : Symptomatic response best response per Investigator , accord RECIST assess . Tumor control rate ( CR + PR + SD ) , TTP , PFS OS also evaluate .</detailed_description>
