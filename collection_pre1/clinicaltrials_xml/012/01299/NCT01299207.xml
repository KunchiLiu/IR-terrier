	<brief_summary>Stents device utilized treat cholesterol blockages coronary ( heart ) artery . The introduction drug-eluting ( coat ) stent clinical practice regard revolutionary breaktrhough , reduce incidence re-narrowing artery percutaneous coronary intervention perform . There , however , concern increase risk clot formation heart arteries patient treat drug-eluting stent . Therefore , order low risk clot formation , recommend patient receive type stent , treat dual antiplatelet therapy ( blood thin medication ) one year . The effect strategy , however , clot formation bleed complication utilize `` new generation '' stent , Xience : Everolimus-eluting Stent , well describe . Therefore , aim registry study evaluate risk adverse cardiovascular event , include mortality , non-fatal myocardial infarction , stent thrombosis , hemorrhagic stroke , severe bleed relation time discontinuation dual antiplatelet therapy patient treat Xience drug-eluting stent , compare patient discontinue dual antiplatelet therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The introduction drug-eluting stent ( DES ) clinical practice universally regard revolutionary breakthrough reduce incidence restenosis follow percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . The coating stent antiproliferative property address fundamental limitation earlier generation bare metal ( uncoated ) stent ( BMS ) - in-growth tissue strut stent may eventually narrow coronary artery result recurrent ischemia . DES greatly reduce need repeat revascularization , thus , use DES rapidly become de facto standard care US . The first two FDA-approved DES United States Cypher : Sirolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent TaxusExpress2â„¢ : Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent . Since , so-called 2nd generation DES come market include Xience : Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent Medtronic : Zotarolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent . Data recent study release September 2009 show Xience/Promus outperform Boston 's Taxus . Just prior release data , US market share Xience 30 % , Promus 24 % , Taxus 22 % , Endeavor 13 % , Cypher 11 % . However , data also release regard Endeavor outperform Taxus stent well , suggest upsurge likely US world market share Medtronic 's Endeavor stent . In data recently present SPIRIT IV trial , randomize study Xience Taxus , significant benefit Xience find comparison Taxus stent . There 38 % reduction target lesion failure 46 % reduction target lesion revascularization compare Taxus . Notably , study nearly 3700 patient , Xience low rate stent thrombosis 1-year 0.17 % , compare 0.85 % Taxus . The COMPARE study higher-risk patient , also confirm result show significant benefit Xience V Taxus Liberte 1-year regard major adverse cardiac event stent thrombosis . These result suggest may significant difference outcomes favor use 2nd generation DES , specifically relate superiority 1st generation DES reduce need repeat revascularization . There , however , limited data examine long-term safety device use routine clinical practice . Furthermore , DES still fully study specific patient population commonly encounter routine clinical practice , include diabetes , chronic kidney disease , long-lesions , small vessel , leave main disease , among others . The outcome revolve around efficacy stent different clinical angiographic scenario , also around safety profile . In particular , great attention place risk stent thrombosis also time event various DES , reduce incidence . The data available date suggest favorable safety result Xience stent . However , ever change world dual antiplatelet therapy , duration , understanding interaction require . Currently , majority effort reduce stent thrombosis channel aggressive long duration dual antiplatelet therapy . The effect strategies endpoint , bleed complication PCI , unknown . These treatment strategy base understand need dual antiplatelet therapy 1st generation DES . Whether paradigms apply 2nd generation DES , Xience stent , unclear . Furthermore , give continue significant question regard precise rate relatively rare clinical event , stent thrombosis bleeding , strategy allow u estimate rate device use routine clinical practice , warrant . Specifically , clinical impact transient permanent discontinuation dual-antiplatelet therapy endpoints various interval Xience implantation routine clinical practice , well characterize . As , continue considerable variability regard duration dual antiplatelet therapy routine clinical practice , regardless type DES utilized . Therefore , registry rigorous long-term follow-up patient treat Xience stent , collect information rare event , compliance dual antiplatelet therapy , relationships use/non-use dual antiplatelet therapy adverse event would address goal . Accordingly , good understand long-term safety profile Xience stent overall population , well dual antiplatelet therapy discontinue , propose evaluate integrate patient data University Pittsburgh Medical Center ( UPMC ) network system use two well-established institution : UPMC clinical site University Pittsburgh 's Epidemiology Data Center ( EDC ) . In brief , propose create UPMC PCI-XIENCE registry , integrate large-volume UPMC clinical site well-established EDC data coordinate center . This allow u investigate long-term safety Xience stent use routine clinical practice . Thus , Specific Aims : 1 . Evaluate risk stent thrombosis , hemorrhagic stroke , severe bleed relation time discontinuation dual anti-platelet therapy patient treat Xience drug-eluting stent . 2 . Study safety efficacy Xience stent within specific understudied patient ( diabetes mellitus , chronic kidney disease , woman , minority , etc ) angiographic ( left main , bifurcation , saphenous vein graft , small vessel disease ) subgroup , among others .</detailed_description>
