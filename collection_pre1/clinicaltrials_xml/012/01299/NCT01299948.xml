	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION 1 . 1 BACKGROUND For treatment advanced HIV infection , combination therapy antiretroviral drug ( ARVs ) best option current international standard . The benefit ARVs best , use relatively late course disease , commonly progression year . However , global perspective , 90 % need ARVs world-wide access . ARVs use early stage infection without significant immunodeficiency . Although variable degree immunodeficiency may present even early HIV disease , establish treatment phase . Immunodeficiency associated decline certain population lymphocyte , CD4 cell T-helper cell . It seem useful concept postulate treatment slow loss CD4 cell could also slow progression HIV disease . In vitro finding clinical study show CD4 cell stabilize effect corticosteroid . First clinical study base relatively high dosage ( Andrieu JM 1995 , LU W 1995 , Andrieu JM 2004 , ) . These hardly justifiable long time , numerous side effect , e.g . immunosuppression cellular immune system , manifestation diabetes Cushing syndrome . In 2005 Ulmer et al . report mono-centric open label study CD4- stabilize effect administration low dose prednisolone ( 5 mg/d ) ( Ulmer A 2005 ) . Patients 300 CD4 cells/µl include . After two year 28 patient treatment present 176.1 CD4 cell 62 control patient comparison baseline count ( p 0.0009 ) three year 15 patient treatment present 236.2 CD4 cells/µl 33 control patient comparison baseline count ( p = 0,0021 ) . The initiation treatment expensive toxic ARVs delayed . Based study increase amount experience Ulmer others , seem justified systematically investigate effect low dose prednisolone progression HIV disease . The cost 5 mg prednisolone per day range 3 US $ per year ( Action Medeor ) . If turn low dose prednisolone prolongs period ARVs become indicate without impose intolerable risk patient , approach could attractive future option country health system resource-poor setting . 1.2 RATIONAL FOR THE STUDY Until , prospective randomize study use corticosteroid latent HIV disease . Furthermore , low dose prednisolone ( 5 mg/d ) sufficient test risk benefit HIV patient especially live poor setting high risk infection . This study assess benefit safety profile low dose prednisolone therapy patient region limited resource high prevalence infection . 1.3 SITE DESCRIPTION The study conduct Bugando Medical Centre Mwanza , Tanzania . 2 . STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 PRIMARY The primary objective study assess effect low dose prednisolone therapy time progression HIV disease . The time progression define time baseline change stag advanced disease ( CDC stage A3 , B3 C ) death ( see Appendix Va ) . 2.2 SECONDARY The follow secondary objective evaluate patient population : - Amount CD4 Cells - Overall survival - Safety profile - Quality life - Immune system status , co-infections - Virus characterization sequence 3 .

PLAN OF STUDY 4.1 STUDY DESIGN This double blind , randomize , phase II placebo-controlled clinical trial oral low dose prednisolone therapy HIV infect patient CDC Stage A1,2 B1,2 ( see Appendix Va ) . The trial mono-centred involve 400 eligible patient Tanzania , divide : - 200 Patients Study medication group - 200 Patients Placebo group The study enrollment period last 12 month ( 30 patient per month ) . A study period 24 month follow . After 12 month , first intermediate analysis do . In case significant negative safety aspect , study continue next 12 month . A follow-up period evaluation add . 4.2 STUDY TREATMENT The patient Treatment Group get prednisolone 5 mg per os daily . The placebo group get one tablet placebo per os daily . 4.3 DOSE MODIFICATION AND DELAY There dose modification plan study . Study drug relate reaction like hypersensitivity reaction , fluid retention , hypertension , gastric ulcer , diabetes treat accord local standard . 4.4 DISCONTINUATION Patients remove study follow reason : - disease progression : upgrading clinical stage and/or CD4 cell count &lt; 200/µl , require start HAART ( = primary study objective , study complete ) ; - development unacceptable toxicity manageable symptomatic care ; - administration antiretroviral treatment ; - significant protocol violation prednisolone group , e.g . interruption take study medication four week ( compliance ) ; - pregnancy ; - consent withdrawn ; - investigator 's decision . Patients always allow refuse participation study withdrawn . The reason removal patient document case report form . Patients eligible valuable study analysis replace . 4.5 PRE-STUDY SCREEN The following data obtain within two week prior randomization : - informed consent sign consent form ( audio consent illiterate person ) ; - complete medical history include date description initial diagnosis HIV infection , concurrent illness concomitant medication ; - physical examination include weight , height , WHO performance status ( Appendix II ) ; - vital sign : blood pressure , pulse rate , oral temperature ; - HIV stag accord CDC : examination AIDS defining sign CD4 cell count ; - chest x-ray exclude active tuberculosis ; - short quality life score ; - clinical laboratory test : full blood count , glucose , liver enzymes ( AST and/or ALT ) , bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase , creatinine ; pregnancy test female patient . 4.6 RANDOMIZATION After check patient 's eligibility , investigator request randomization . A Randomization list provide BMC . The randomization number give study nurse . The study medication double blind . Block randomization may use . 4.7 EVALUATION DURING THE STUDY 4.7.1 EVALUATION EVERY VISIT ( MONTH 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,9,12,15,18,21,24 ) The patient examine every month follow parameter : - medical history update , include documentation concurrent condition , hospitalization concomitant medication ; - quality life score ; - physical examination include weight WHO performance status ; - vital sign : blood pressure , pulse rate oral temperature ; - HIV stag accord CDC : examination AIDS defining sign CD4 cell count ; - full haematological blood count ; - serum chemistry : glucose level , liver enzymes ( AST and/or ALT ) , bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase , creatinine ; - pregnancy test female patient . - toxicity evaluation : Toxicity define study drug relate adverse event ( AE ) grade 3 ( severe ) 4 ( life threaten ) .
