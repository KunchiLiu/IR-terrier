	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Paliperidone Palmitate Participants With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither physician participant know name assigned drug ) , placebo-controlled ( inactive substance ; pretend treatment [ drug ] compare clinical trial drug test drug real effect ) , parallel-group ( compare response two group participant receive different treatment ) , fixed-dose , multi-center ( one hospital medical school team work medical research study ) study paliperidone palmitate participant schizophrenia . The study consist 3 period : 2-week pre-observation ( screen ) period , double-blind period Day 1 ( baseline ) Week 13 ( end double-blind period ) assessment , post-observation period start Week 13 assessment Week 21 . For participant discontinue study last assessment Week 13 , post-observation period start discontinuation double-blind period assessment follow-up visit 4 , 8 , 12 week last injection . After completion double-blind period ( Week 13 ) , discontinuation double-blind period treatment withdrawal study , participant may receive treatment consistent usual standard care . The total duration study 21 week , include double-blind post-observation period . Participants randomly assign 1 2 treatment group 1:1 ratio ( intramuscular injection either paliperidone palmitate match placebo ) . Injections paliperidone palmitate placebo give Day 1 Weeks 1 , 5 , 9 study drug manager and/or injector . For participant receive paliperidone palmitate , Day 1 injection 150 milligram equivalent ( mg eq . ) paliperidone palmitate , follow 100 mg eq . injection paliperidone palmitate Week 1 , 75 mg eq . injection paliperidone palmitate Weeks 5 9 . Participants randomly assign placebo receive injection match paliperidone palmitate injection day . Efficacy assess use Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) , Clinical Global Impression - Severity ( CGI-S ) . Participant 's safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
