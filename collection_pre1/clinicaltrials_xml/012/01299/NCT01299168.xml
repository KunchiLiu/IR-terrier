	<brief_summary>The current standard biopsy-based diagnosis dysfunction kidney transplant Banff Classification represent arbitrary international consensus . Recent data-driven approach use molecular conventional technology indicate mere consensus produce frequently incorrect diagnose potential harm patient due inappropriate treatment . To address unmet need improve diagnostics area organ transplantation , Alberta Transplant Applied Genomics Centre ( ATAGC ) develop new diagnostic system combine molecular histopathological feature transplant biopsy , plus clinical laboratory parameter , create first Integrated Diagnostic System . The present study validate refine system 500 prospectively unselected biopsy clinical indication American , Canadian European centre addition 300 biopsy already collect . Thus extension INTERCOM study ( INTERCOMEX ) . In addition demonstrate feasibility value System routine patient care clinical trial , study develop optimize transparent user-friendly reporting format communicate information clinician obtain detailed feedback system best improve patient care .</brief_summary>
