	<criteria>Willing able sign inform consent Male female , 18 year old Confirmed diagnosis multiple myeloma ( secretory disease ) International Myeloma Working Group Diagnostic Criteria Patients must meet one follow criterion : Previously treat patient multiple myeloma achieve least stable disease fail achieve complete response ( CR ) minimum one cytoreductive therapy multiple myeloma detectable nonprogressing disease . Patients must receive least one proteasome inhibitor ( eg , bortezomib ) one immunomodulatory agent ( eg , thalidomide lenalidomide ) . Patients receive lenalidomide maintenance therapy may continue receive therapy provide patient maintenance therapy minimum 3 month evidence disease stabilization . Disease stabilization define M protein varies ≤ 25 % three measurement remain 0.5 g/dL whichever small . ECOG performance status 02 Life expectancy ≥ 3 month Laboratory criterion ( within 14 day first study drug administration ) : ANC ≥ 1000/μL Platelet count ≥ 50 x 103/μL ( without transfusion support within 2 week prior first study drug administration ) Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL Serum creatinine ≤ 3 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , unless due disease . Must fully recover previous cancer treatment and/or major surgery . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test agree use effective birth control ( two reliable form contraception ) least 12 week last treatment . Males must agree use effective birth control partner 12 week last treatment imetelstat . For patient receive lenolidomide , male must use latex condom sexual contact woman childbearing potential even undergone successful vasectomy . Women pregnant breast feed Prior radioimmunotherapy . Known intracranial disease epidural disease . Patients lytic lesion cranium spine secondary myeloma eligible enroll . Clinically significant cardiovascular disease condition include : Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) require therapy Need antiarrhythmic therapy ventricular arrhythmia Severe conduction disturbance Angina pectoris require therapy Uncontrolled hypertension per Investigator 's discretion New York Heart Association Class II , III , IV cardiovascular disease Active chronically recurrent bleeding ( eg , active peptic ulcer disease ) Clinically relevant active infection . Serious comorbid medical condition , include cirrhosis chronic obstructive chronic restrictive pulmonary disease . Symptomatic hyperviscosity syndrome . Any cancer therapy include chemotherapy , monoclonal antibody , signal transduction inhibitor , immunotherapy , glucocorticoid ( except topical premedication ) , thalidomide within 3 week prior first study drug administration . Investigational therapy within 4 week prior first study drug administration . Major surgery within 4 week prior first study drug administration ( central line placement allow ) Antiplatelet therapy within 2 week prior first study drug administration , low dose aspirin prophylaxis therapy . Full dose anticoagulation . Prophylactic low dose administration management IV access device allow . Known positive serology human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV . Any severe , acute , chronic medical psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality , difficulty comply protocol requirement may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate study</criteria>
