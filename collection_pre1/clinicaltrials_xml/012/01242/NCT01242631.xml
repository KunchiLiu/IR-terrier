	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether drug everolimus effective treatment patient relapse cancer testis . This phase II study patient receive study drug ( everolimus 10 mg daily ) . The primary endpoint study rate patient progressive disease 12 week treatment . Twenty-five evaluable patient treat study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale Patients metastatic germ cell cancer relapse two course cisplatin-based chemotherapy high-dose chemotherapy poor prognosis treatment option . Everolimus derivative rapamycin act signal transduction inhibitor . Its target mTOR ( mammalian target rapamycin ) , key protein kinase regulate cell growth , proliferation survival . The mTOR pathway activity modulate PI3K1AKT pathway know deregulate numerous human cancer , include germ cell tumor . Everolimus investigate anticancer agent base potential act : - Directly tumor cell inhibit tumor cell growth proliferation - Indirectly inhibit angiogenesis lead reduced tumor vascularity Study design An open-label , single arm , non-randomized , single stage phase II study . Screening phase : Baseline evaluation perform within 2 week first dose study drug . Treatment phase : All patient receive everolimus disease progression ( RECIST tumor marker ) unacceptable toxicity study discontinuation reason . A treatment cycle consist 3 week . Dose reduction dose interruption ( 2 week ) allow intolerable toxicity . Follow-up phase : All patient follow survival . Visit schedule Tumor Response progression assess use RECIST criterion assessment tumor marker . Tumor measurement CT scan MRI perform screen within 2 week prior first dose study drug . During study period , CT scan/MRI perform every 6 week ( Â± one week ) , time discontinuation study drug ( within 2 week ) . The type scan ( CT MRI ) use screen must use subsequent follow-up assessment . A partial complete response warrant confirmation sooner 4 week later 6 week observation . Tumor marker ( AFP , HCG ) assess every 3 week . A tumor marker reduction &gt; 90 % without increase tumor size consider partial response . A tumor marker increase &gt; 25 % without increase tumor size consider progressive disease confirm 3 week observation . Translational research The following retrospective pathological examination tumor sample perform patient give additional informed consent : - immunohistochemistry mismatch repair gene hMLH1 , hMSH2 , hMSH6 , PMS2 , cell signal effector pMAPK , pAKT , pS6K PTEN . - mutation analysis PTEN , BRAF , p53 , examination microsatellite instability This information correlate treatment response ( CR , PR , SO PD ) week 12 exploratory analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male patient &gt; = 18 year old . Patients histologically proven seminomatous nonseminomatous germ cell cancer Disease progression cisplatinbased chemotherapy Disease progression relapse highdose chemotherapy Disease progression relapse least 2 different cisplatinbased regimen contraindication highdose chemotherapy . Patients must receive prior combination chemotherapy gemcitabine , oxaliplatin paclitaxel ( GOP ) . Prior treatment combination two drug allow case contraindication GOP . Disease progression study entry : progressive disease accord RECIST criterion baseline examination tumor marker increase &gt; 25 % within 4 week study entry . ECOG performance status &lt; = 2 . Life expectancy &gt; = 3 month . Adequate bone marrow function : absolute neutrophil count &gt; = 1.5 x 109/1 , platelet &gt; = 75 x 109/1 , hemoglobin &gt; = 9 g/dl . Adequate liver function : serum bilirubin : &lt; = 1.5x ULN , ALT AST &lt; = 2.5x ULN . For patient know liver metastasis : AST ALT &lt; = 5x ULN . Adequate renal function : serum creatinine &lt; = 2.0x ULN . Patients must surgically sterile must agree use effective contraception study treatment . Signed write informed consent . Systemic antitumor treatment within 21 day study entry . Simultaneous radiotherapy target lesion ( ) . Patients undergone major surgery within 4 week prior start study drug ( e.g . intrathoracic , intraabdominal , intrapelvic ) significant traumatic injury , recover side effect Patients previously receive mTOR inhibitor ( sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus ) . Patients receive chronic systemic treatment corticosteroid ( dose &gt; = 20 mg/day methylprednisone equivalent ) another immunosuppressive agent . Patients unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction &lt; = 6 month prior first study treatment , congestive heart failure NYHA IIIIV serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia . Patients severely impaired lung function : spirometry DLCO &lt; 50 % normal predict value . Uncontrolled diabetes : fasting serum glucose &gt; 2.0x ULN . Patients active uncontrolled infection , incl . chronic Hepatitis B C Patients history another primary malignancy treatment &lt; = 3 year , exception nonmelanoma skin cancer . Patients participate another clinical trial within 30 day study entry . Other serious medical condition could impair ability patient participate study . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol .</criteria>
