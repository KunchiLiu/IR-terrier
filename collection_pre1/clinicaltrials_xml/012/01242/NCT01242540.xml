	<brief_summary>Blood oxygen level dependant ( BOLD ) functional magnetic resonance imaging ( FMRI ) investigation pain provide substantial insight working human brain . To date , however , vast majority study deal short painful stimulation . This work expand investigator knowledge long stimulation process compare activation pattern two minute painful stimulation 30-second painful stimulus . The investigator hypothesis accommodation long stimulation evident either decrease signal intensity brain area know process pain , increase activity brain area think responsible modulation painful perception .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Activation During Accommodation Painful Stimulation With FMRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Over past 14 year , BOLD FMRI study non-invasively show pain activates matrix area , activation decay stimulation , possibly reflect body 's ability `` accommodate '' stimulation . The majority use short application pain last 1 30 second . However , investigator use stimulation much long period typical year ago . The effect signal decay activation map generate longer task know . Because signal change many subcortical area involve pain process low , error analysis due neglect signal decay may induce significant artifact . Materials Methods : Using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation , 20 healthy volunteer experience two different painful stimulation : repeat 30-second long stimulation constant 2 minute stimulation . The brain activity determine compare . In addition , signal decay painful stimulation quantify compare . Significance : Investigators use long stimulation period attempt understand brain process `` real- life '' pain instead artificial on-off pattern early study . However , significant attention pay possible effect accommodation stimulus may impact activity pattern find . In addition , proof activation pain-control area like periaquaductal gray inverse change occur pain-perceiving area seek . This study address issue single BOLD FMRI experiment .</detailed_description>
