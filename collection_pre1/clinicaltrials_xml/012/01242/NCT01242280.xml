	<brief_summary>In last year , important advance do treatment prevention esophageal variceal bleeding . Experts agree combination pharmacological endoscopic therapy first line therapy acute bleed episode ; whereas TIPS ( transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt ) consider rescue therapy . Nevertheless , patient would require different therapy act `` bridge '' definitive therapy institute . Balloon tamponade ( use Sengstaken tube ) represent , , widely use temporary `` bridge '' TIPS . However , balloon tamponade associate high incidence serious adverse event . Recently , use self-expanding metal stent introduce treatment acute variceal bleed show high hemostatic efficacy adverse event . The present study direct compare efficacy free adverse event mortality self-expanding metal stent vs balloon tamponade patient variceal bleed refractory medical endoscopic therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Self-expandable Esophageal Stent Versus Balloon Tamponade Refractory Esophageal Variceal Bleeding .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Acute variceal bleeding ( AVB ) carry 20 % death rate acute episode nearly 50 % related-mortality first year episode . ( 1 ) . Prognostic factor AVB include : severity bleeding , degree liver failure development complication bleed . Therefore , AVB therapy must : achieve primary hemostasis prevent treat hypovolemia related complication . After hemodynamic stabilization , upper endoscopy do confirm diagnosis start specific therapy , say : 1/ vasoactive drug ( terlipressin somatostatin ) ; 2/ endoscopic therapy ( variceal band ligation ) . These two combine therapy achieve control AVB 80 % case ( 2 ) . Nevertheless , remain 20 % , AVB control require balloon-tamponade bridge definitive hemostatic therapy TIPS surgical shunt ( 3 ) . The Sengstaken-Blakemore tube widely use balloon tamponade . In experienced hand provide bleed control rate 90 % . It use skilled staff intensive care facility fatal complication may arise 20 % case . The main complication : aspiration pneumonia , esophageal rupture , asphyxia due balloon migration , esophageal ulcer , tongue nose lip necrosis , arrythmia chest pain . These complication time-related , therefore , balloon tamponade never must remain inflated 24h . Recently , self-expandable esophageal stent introduce alternative esophageal balloon tamponade AVB ( 4 ) . Twenty patient AVB control combined endoscopic pharmacological therapy retrospectively include study . The patient receive self-expandable metal esophageal stent ( SX-Ella-Danis , Czesc Republic ) . The stent place without complication case achieve 100 % success control AVB . Two 14 day , stent retire . The author observe case severe stent-related complication rebleeding episode ( 4 ) . These data suggest self-expandable esophageal stent could represent safe effective option temporary treat patient AVB refractory medical endoscopic therapy . In addition , theoretically , esophageal stent could associate low incidence adverse event balloon tamponade . EXPECTED RESULTS The initial hypothesis : - The use esophageal stent AVB refractory medical endoscopic therapy associate high efficacy absence adverse event balloon tamponade use Sengstaken-Blakemore tube . - The two hemostatic method correctly position 90-95 % case . - Patient 's tolerability ( absence chest pain , dysphagia food intolerance ) increase use esophageal stent . - The applicability definitive hemostatic therapy , TIPS combine pharmacological endoscopic eradicative therapy surgical shunt , high use esophageal stent Sengstaken tube . ENDPOINTS Primary endpoint : The primary endpoint combine absence bleed + absence severe adverse event probably relate study device + survival first 15 day inclusion study hospital discharge . Patients compare liver cirrhosis AVB control combined pharmacological endoscopic therapy ( see definition ) . Those patient randomize receive self-expandable esophageal stent ( SX-Ella-Danis ) balloon tamponade Sengstaken-Blakemore tube . Secondary endpoint : - Absence bleed day 15th , 42nd 6 month inclusion . - Survival day 15th , 42nd 6 month inclusion . - Transfusional requirement ( pack red cell , platelet fresh frozen plasma ) . - Individual adverse event . - Analgesia sedation requirement . - Hospital stay . - Applicability definitive hemostatic therapy . - Use hospital resource ( TIPS , derivative surgery additional endoscopic therapy ) . SAMPLE SIZE The study use calculate sample size show reference 7 22 . None study consider combined end-point current study . As show , incidence adverse event varied time , high incidence observe recent study . In summary , consider 55 % patient receive esophageal balloon tamponade achieve primary end-point . To increase figure 90 % group receive esophageal prothesis , 0.05 alpha error 0.20 beta error , study must include 46 patient ( 23 per arm ) . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The result analyze intention-to-treat basis . The data compare use Student test Chi-squared need . Probability survival curve construct use Kaplan-Meier method compare Mantel-Cox test . Logistic regression use identify independent predictor survival . An interim analysis plan inclusion 28 patient ( 60 % overall size ) . The study finish interim analysis show significant statistical difference ( p &lt; 0.02 ) futility ( lack difference ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The study include patient cirrhosis admit hospital acute esophageal variceal bleeding define accord Baveno II criterion ( 5 ) achieve follow criterion : Failure control bleed despite pharmacological ( somatostatin 3 6 mg/12h iv terlipressin , 2mg/4h iv ) AND endoscopic therapy ( esophageal band ligation preferably sclerotherapy ) . Failure control bleeding define , accord Baveno IV criterion ( 6 ) , evidence continuous digestive bleeding following : Hematemesis ( nasogastric aspirate &gt; 100 ml fresh blood ) &gt; 2h start combine pharmacological endoscopic therapy . Decrease hemoglobin value &gt; 3g v previous value ( without blood transfusion ) . Massive bleeding . Acute variceal bleed uncontrolled despite pharmacological therapy start moment , need previous endoscopic therapy . Uncontrolled bleeding define upper digestive bleeding hemodynamic stability ( systolic arterial pressure &gt; 70 mmHg heart rate &lt; 100 bpm ) could achieve . Age &lt; 18 year . Esophageal rupture . Esophageal , gastric upper respiratory tract tumor . Esophageal stenosis . Recent esophageal surgery . Previous esophageal tamponade treat index bleed . Big hiatal hernia preclude correct placement esophageal device . Known hepatocellular carcinoma surpass Milan criterion . Terminal disease . No write consent participate study .</criteria>
