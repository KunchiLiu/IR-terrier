	<brief_summary>Discriminating irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , especially mild disease activity , common clinical challenge . Most patient suspect IBS go invasive procedure ( colonoscopy/gastroscopy ) . In order avoid invasive investigation , search noninvasive marker capacity distinguish IBS IBD . Dr Hossam Haick ( Department Chemical Engineering , Technion ) develop system combine nano-metals produce laboratory electrical device ( transistor ) . The combination nanomaterial electrical transistor induces change electrical behavior upon exposure material examine ; , change electrical property . The change electrical behavior translate computerized graphic signal . The electronic nose compose air pump , filter filter external contaminant array sensor . Each sensor transmit signal accord material `` know '' identify . Thus , possible characterize substance family characteristic certain disease , system design differential diagnosis different disease . The purpose investigator study use `` electronic nose '' find bio-markers help diagnose IBD IBS without use invasive procedure . The plan collect 200 sample ( 50 IBS ' 50 Crohn 's disease , 50 ulcerative colitis 50 control ) . The patient include study undergo evaluation gastroenterologist signing informed consent answer questionnaire . The sample analyze laboratory Dr. Haick .</brief_summary>
