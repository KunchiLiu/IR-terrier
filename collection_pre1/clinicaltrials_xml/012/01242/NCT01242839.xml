	<brief_summary>CACICOL20 biodegradable nanopolymer engineer mimic glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate . Applied corneal lesion , replaces damage heparan sulfate matrix scaffold . CACICOL20 bind matrix protein collagen cytokine endogenous growth factor cellular microenvironment . CACICOL20 provide protective function restores matrix architecture . This produce suitable spatial environment cell respond properly cascade signal need tissue regeneration resume . The ophthalmic solution , CACICOL20 , use corneal ulcer well tolerate locally generally , prove pilot study conduct `` Hôpital des XV-XX '' Paris ( France ) . It reduce pain significantly increase corneal ulcer healing ( ulcer treat resistant usual therapy ) . Therefore , accuracy Randomized multicentric double blind study evaluate efficacy CACICOL20 versus placebo chronic corneal ulcer heal show begin mid-may 2010 . In study , CACICOL20 apply every 2 4 day 3 month . The aim study double blind comparison complete chronic corneal ulcer heal rate within 3 month 3 group patient double blind randomize CACICOL20 instillation distribution physiological salt solution instillation distribution . The main judgment criterion heal rate within 3 month define corneal ulcer complete closure .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients noninfectious , corneal chronic ulcer , painful , whose depth exceed superficial stroma . Resistance corneal pathology standard treatment : eye drop promote healing , tear substitute , antiinflammatory drug , cyclosporin . Patients previously treat corneal pathology , assess ineffective Insufficiently effective investigator Patients use wet gel eye drop without conservator inclusion Antiinflammatory local treatment must stop least 8 day . No contact lenses lenses must remove least 8 day . Age inclusion ≥ 18 year . Written sign informed consent patient . Realization preliminary medical examination . Covers social insurance Ulcers deeper superficial stroma , perforate ulcer preperforated Corneal abscess Infectious progressive ulcerative keratitis Patients receive antiinflammatory eye drop steroid cyclosporine treatment ( case , possibility inclusion clinical protocol Case `` washout 8 day ) Patients longterm eye drop contain preservative stop replaced equivalent without preservative Patients systemic antiinflammatory , antiallergic , psychotropic antibiotic therapy , modify since less 10 day likely shortterm Wearing contact lenses patient stop least eight day start protocol ocular surgery within last 3 month patient already include another clinical trial investigational product Pregnant patient breastfeed Person legal protection measure , guardianship Unable follow medical examination geographical , social psychological reason Not cover social insurance .</criteria>
