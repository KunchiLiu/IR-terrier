In randomized clinical trial 200 obese patient heart disease risk factor , investigator evaluate impact nurse dietitian case management weight loss weight maintenance , adjunct physician care . In addition , investigator test incremental benefit environmental support strategy use community health worker help patient navigate home neighborhood environment achieve weight loss .

	<detailed_description>Obesity epidemic U.S. , third adult obese . Obesity exert enormous impact nation 's health economy largely effect coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk factor : 3 4 obese Americans least one CHD risk factor reversible weight loss . Working within acute care-centered system , clinician unsuccessful help patient lose weight prevent weight gain . A promising well-studied approach integrate care deliver nurse dietitian case manager ( CMs ) . Nonetheless , clinical prevention service ( include CM ) may less effective provided isolation patient ' living environment often reinforce caloric excess physical inactivity . This application leverage extensive expertise develop disseminate effective CM program ( Heart Heart , R01 HL070781 ) . We implement obesity-focused CM program focus establish behavioral weight loss maintenance strategy evidence-based CHD prevention target . We also test additional benefit structure `` environmental support '' ( ES ) carry community health worker bridge gap clinic patient ' home neighborhood . Our Specific Aims : 1 . Implement innovative , primary care-based CM CM+ES intervention randomize clinical trial . We conduct trial San Mateo Medical Center ( SMMC ) health center serve ethnically diverse , low-income population . We randomize 200 obese adult least one obesity-related CHD risk factor 18 month usual primary care ( 40 patient ) , CM alone ( 80 ) , CM+ES ( 80 ) . Intervention patient receive intensive weight loss CHD risk intervention 12 month , follow 12 month maintenance intervention . 2 . Determine effectiveness cost-effectiveness CM CM+ES improve BMI CHD risk factor , relative usual care . Our PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS patient manage CM+ES experience great reduction BMI 24-months CM . 3 . Transition favor intervention sustainable program , support County , well explore opportunity broad dissemination County non-County system . A business case dissemination base finding critical seek investment . This project develop test two novel model care design support sustain weight loss . Given failure current mechanism address obesity elevate CHD risk , model potential provide blueprint primary care-based obesity service reduce nation 's burden obesity , especially low-income population .</detailed_description>
