	<brief_title>ABC-04 Study Cisplatin , Gemcitabine Selumetinib Patients With Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial aim evaluate safety tolerability selumetinib combination CisGem establish recommend dose take phase II study . Pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic endpoint assess preliminary efficacy data also collect . Patients Advanced Biliary tract Cancer receive CisGem regimen selumetinib . A dose de-escalation scheme employ determine recommend phase II dose selumetinib . Patients recruit cohort three assess dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) first cycle treatment . Depending number DLTs observe , cohort may expand , next cohort may enrol low dose dose may declare recommend dose . Patients receive eight cycle CisGem may continue receive selumetinib progression disease .</detailed_description>
