	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Early surgery may fewer side effect improve recovery . Palliative surgery radiation therapy may help patient advanced breast cancer live comfortably . It yet know whether early surgery effective palliative therapy advance breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study early surgery see well work compare standard palliative therapy treat patient stage IV breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Surgery Standard Palliative Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate whether early local therapy comprise surgery intact primary disease compare local palliative therapy patient stage IV breast cancer , whose disease progress initial optimal systemic therapy , result prolong survival . Secondary - To compare time uncontrolled chest wall disease patient treat regimen . - To determine whether difference health-related quality-of-life ( HRQOL ) patient treat regimen . - To determine whether absolute value circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) burden 6 month follow randomization ( time +6 ) lower palliative therapy arm early local therapy arm , whether value inversely related survival ( low CTC , long survival ) . - To collect tumor blood specimens future exploration biological interaction primary tumor metastatic lesion effect primary tumor resection . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord hormone receptor treatment plan ( ER+ PR+ , HER2- , endocrine therapy alone vs ER+ PR+ , HER2- , chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy v ER- PR- , HER2- v HER2+ ) , number involve organ system distant disease ( regional node axillary , supraclavicular , internal mammary location consider distant site ) ( 1 v &gt; 1 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive standard palliative therapy , need , address symptom tumor ulceration , pain , bulky adenopathy cause arm symptom , similar situation . Therapy may consist radiotherapy alone , surgery alone , combination . - Arm II : Patients undergo surgery comprise breast-conserving therapy ( BCT ) total mastectomy accord patient treat physician preference . Surgery occur later 10 week completion 32 week systemic therapy . Free surgical margin must achieve re-excision mastectomy patient undergoing BCT . After completion BCT , patient undergo radiotherapy day , 5 day per week . Patients mastectomy undergo radiotherapy discretion treat physician . Patients may undergo blood tumor tissue sample collection circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) burden future study . Patients complete Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy - Breast Trial Outcome Index ( FACT- TOI ) FACT - General ( 22 ) Breast Cancer Subscale ( FACT-B ) quality-of-life questionnaire baseline periodically study . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
