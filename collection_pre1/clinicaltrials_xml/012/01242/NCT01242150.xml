	<brief_summary>In critically ill pediatric patient Acute Respiratory Failure ( ARF ) , Noninvasive Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( NCPAP ) apply avoid intubation relate complication tracheal injury predisposition nosocomial pulmonary infection . The choice interface one crucial issue affect treatment outcome pediatric age particular preschool child intolerance frequently compromise noninvasive respiratory treatment . NCPAP apply either nasal facial tight fit mask important principle guide selection interface fit comfortably . However , nasal mask leak gas infant open his/her mouth , facial mask cause significant gastric distension vomiting , risk aspirate gastric content . Moreover , complication air leak , skin irritation bridge nose , discomfort report nasal facial mask child frequently lead interruption respiratory treatment . Thus , improve interface patient ventilator would expect facilitate longer effective application NCPAP . A new small helmet specifically design young infant recently introduce administer NCPAP . In recent short term crossover physiological randomize controlled trial , investigator find NCPAP helmet associate enhanced feasibility , less need sedation prolong application time ( see reference ) . The purpose prospective randomize multicenter study compare efficacy feasibility NCPAP deliver either helmet facial mask treat acute respiratory failure infant admit Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospective , randomize , multicenter clinical study parallel group involve consecutive infant age &gt; 1 month &lt; 2 yr , admit PICU Fondazione IRCCS Ca'Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico , Children Hospital V. Buzzi Milan , Gemelli Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore Rome , mild severe acute respiratory failure ( ARF ) . For screen purpose ARF define presence following : respiratory rate &gt; 50 breaths/min ; Partial arterial Oxygen tension/Inspired Oxygen Fraction ratio ( PaO2/FiO2 ) &lt; 300 , chest x-ray compatible clinical diagnosis , significant clinical improvement breathe oxygen 8 l/min least 15 min . Before enrollment patient receive standard medical therapy consist oxygen administration via Venturi mask achieve peripheral oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) &gt; 92 % medication include aerosolized salbutamol adrenaline , anticholinergic , steroid , intravenous antibiotic , correction electrolyte , intravascular volume abnormality clinically indicate . Heart rate , systemic arterial blood pressure , respiratory rate , SpO2 continuously monitor . Patients define require NCPAP deteriorate despite medical treatment meet least one follow criterion : SpO2 &lt; 90 % FiO2 &gt; 40 % , arterial pH &lt; 7.25 , respiratory rate &gt; 50 breaths/min , severe deterioration mental status ( Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 10 ) . Eligible patient meet two criterion randomly assign receive NCPAP either full-face mask helmet . Random assignment make sealed envelope . Informed consent obtain least one parent legal guardian enrollment study . To facilitate tolerance maximum 2 bolus midazolam 0.1 mg/kg intravenous administer eventually follow intravenous continuous infusion rate , accord attend physician 's discretion . Once interface position , baseline CPAP level set 4 cm H2O raise increment 2 cm H2O every 20 min maximum 10 cm H2O improve respiratory performance evidence oxygen need , respiratory rate decrease reduction accessory muscle activity . Inspired Oxygen Fraction ( FiO2 ) set achieve SpO2≥ 92 % . NCPAP administer intermittently least 8 hour day first 48 hour enrollment , daily administration last longer well tolerate less either wean intubation criterion achieve . In case persistent intolerance interface despite sedative administration , alternate interface use consider tracheal intubation . For patient nasogastric tube seal connector lower rigid part helmet dome mask use avoid air leak . All patient keep semirecumbent position . Criteria wean NCPAP discontinue infant show normal mental status , stable haemodynamics , SpO2 &gt; 94 % room air activation accessory muscle paradoxical abdominal motion . Criteria endotracheal intubation The predetermine criterion endotracheal intubation NCPAP administration , despite use NCPAP , hemodynamic electrocardiographic instability ; inability improve dyspnea , condition require intubation either protect airway manage copious tracheal secretion . End point definitions The primary outcome variable rate treatment failure group . Treatment failure define infant either shifted alternate interface intolerance tracheally intubate gas exchange deterioration . A successful treatment define ability administer NCPAP least 8 hour day first 24 hour avoid tracheal intubation first 48 hour . Secondary end-points include : gas exchange improvement , complication present admission , length stay mortality PICU . Arterial partial oxygen carbon dioxide tension , arterial pH , respiratory rate , heart rate systolic arterial blood pressure evaluate 2 , 24 48 hour enrollment . Early improvement oxygenation define increase PaO2/FiO2 &gt; 20 % baseline ; sustain improvement define ability maintain increase oxygenation 24 hour enrollment . At time interval Objective Pain Scale ( OPS ) , index patient intolerance interface Respiratory Effort Score ( RES ) , index respiratory muscle activity , record . Intolerance NCPAP treatment define increment OPS &gt; 4 . In first 24 hour total amount sedation total duration NCPAP administration also record .</detailed_description>
