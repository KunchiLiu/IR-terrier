	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY Ovarian cancer gynecological cancer high risk mortality . This diagnosis often make advanced cancer stage metastasis throughout peritoneum . The standard treatment condition till consist primary debulking surgery tumor , uterus ovary remove , follow minimum six treatment platinum-based chemotherapy . This operation often accompany serious complication example bleeding , embolic event , infection extreme case , even mortality . An international study lead Prof. Dr. Ignace Vergote ( Gynaecological Oncology ) show first time patient advanced stage ovarian cancer receive first three neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy regimen follow interval debulking surgery , turn follow least 3 treatment platinum-based chemotherapy , few complication patient treat primary debulking surgery follow chemotherapy . Moreover , final survival rate group seem similar . The important prognostic marker appear whether patient primary interval surgery longer visible residual tumor treatment . Patients small metastasis peritoneum , seem well treat primary surgery ( neoadjuvant Vergote I , et al Chemotherapy Primary Surgery Stage IIIC IV Ovarian Crystallising , N Engl J Med 363 ( 1910 ) : 943 - 953 ) . Each patient suspect advanced ovarian cancer undergo preoperative evaluation ass two treatment best option . This course , individual patient , take account comorbidity , cancer stage , number location metastases etc . Currently , [ 18F ] FDG-PET/CT , CT conventional MRI use staging , detect recurrence metastasis evaluate therapy response . These technique disadvantage . A PET study take long time perform make use radioactive material . The addition CT also give rise additional radiation . [ 18F ] FDG accumulate inflammatory cell tumor . This explain difficulty concern early evaluation treatment response . Although CT allow high resolution image entire body , sometimes technology lack sufficient sensitivity specificity . Although conventional MRI high sensitivity detection liver metastasis , lack efficient whole-body image stag disadvantage assess systemic tumor spread metastasis . Small peritoneal metastasis therefore often miss technique . Diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) emerge technology currently use cancer imaging . Here difference movement water molecule provide information integrity cellular membrane . DWI advantage contrast material require also need exposure ionize radiation . Further development technology allow acceptable time whole body conduct research , able image gastrointestinal tumor whole body technique . AIM OF THE STUDY The aim study assess whole body diffusion weight imaging ( WB-DWI ) non-invasive method , patient confirm ovarian cancer presence peritoneal metastasis . This assess two treatment ( primary debulking surgery follow chemotherapy versus platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow interval debulking surgery , follow turn chemotherapy ) best option particular type patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients diagnose stage IIIC IV epithelial ovarian cancer presence peritoneal metastasis , voluntary basis , enrol study . These patient 'll either underwent primary debulking surgery follow least six course platinumbased chemotherapy patient assign three course neoadjuvant platinumbased chemotherapy follow interval debulking surgery , follow turn least three course platinumbased chemotherapy . Patients known contraindication MRI ( cardiac pacemaker , cochlear implant , claustrophobic patient ) exclude study . And patient contraindication Gadoliniumbased contrast agent patient know restricted renal function ( GFR &lt; 30 ml/min ) .</criteria>
