	<brief_title>Video-based Training Rehabilitation Upper Limb Functions After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical study multicenter , open , randomize , control , parallel group trial three investigative arm . The study recruit least 375 first stroke patient certain motoric disability randomly assign either one experimental condition one two control condition . Every individual patient participate 31 ( +/- 1 ) week trial ( see fig . 1 ) , whole study plan last least 3 year . The recruitment treatment patient last 17 month trial . Patients undergo baseline assessment screening purpose course participation three assessment primary secondary efficacy endpoint . These endpoint refer degree recover objective subjective physical ability due experimental treatment comparison control comparators . Studies ' hypothesis claim experimental treatment lead effect motoric ability superior effect elicit control treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Hospitalized patient : discharge rehabilitation within follow week ; outpatient : insult 6 week 2 year past ( control via medical history ) . Age 30 80 year , since old patient could probably exercise stamina necessary participation throughout whole time course treatment ( control via discharge letter hospitalize patient , note general practitioner outpatient , respectively ) . First clinically evident stroke patient history stroke relate training treatment ( control via medical history ) . Ischemic cortical subcortical lesion middle cerebral artery territory result mainly define motoric impairment ( control via medical history ) . Upper limb paresis ( control via standard neurological examination ) . Minimal movement ability paretic limb ( control MRC index ≥2 ≤4 : hand extension gravity wrist = 20° metacarpophalangeal interphalangeal joint finger = 10° ) participate treatment ' physical training task . If medication need : stable concomitant medication ( control via discharge letter hospitalize patient , note general practitioner outpatient , respectively ) Signed inform consent participate trial . Brain stem infarction . These lesion site result impairment could interfere treatment ( control via discharge letter hospitalize patient , note general practitioner outpatient , respectively ) . Impaired level consciousness could prevent patient understand follow instruction throughout intervention , result inability hold attentiveness concentration treatment ( control via standard neurological examination ) . Severe aphasia could prevent patient understand follow instruction throughout intervention ( control administration Token test , TT , &gt; 11 incorrect reaction ) . Dementia could lead impaired ability follow instruction ( control administration MiniMentalState Examination , MMSE , score &lt; 26 ) . Depression could result major difficulty patient motivational compliance follow instruction participate intervention ' task throughout treatment ( control administration Beck Depression Inventory , BDI , score &lt; 15 ) . Apraxia could lead impaired ability follow instruction ( control administration Florida Apraxia Screening Test , FAST , &lt; 10 correct reaction and/ &gt; 10 incorrect reaction ) . Neglect could lead impaired ability participate treatment observational task ( control administration Albert 's Neglect Test , &gt; 1 line unchecked ) . Severe psychiatric disorder , severe pulmonary cardiovascular disease , epilepsy could lead reduce ability participate treatment ' task ( control via discharge letter hospitalize patient , note general practitioner outpatient , respectively ) . Severe joint deformity arthritic origin could reduce patient ability task demand functional physical execution thus result mask possible training effect ( control via standard neurological examination ) . Motor problem primarily unilateral excessive pain major affect limb could reduce patient ability task demand functional physical execution thus result mask possible training effect ( control via standard neurological examination ) . Actual treatment Botox neuroleptic ; constant concomitant medication ( control via discharge letter hospitalize patient , note general practitioner outpatient , respectively ) . Planned start rehabilitation therapy might interfere trial treatment next eight week time point recruitment . Insufficient knowledge german language understand fill questionnaire ( clinical judgement standard neurological examination ) . Residence 300 kilometre participate centre , would exacerbate regular visit patient respective centre ( control question patient ) . People accommodated institution court administrative order ( control question patient ) . Any illness medical treatment drug narcotic misuse could interfere assessment safety , tolerability efficacy , e.g . current bone fracture stroke affected limb . ( controlled via discharge letter hospitalize patient , note general practitioner outpatient , respectively ) . Simultaneous participation another ( clinical ) trial interfere examination participation study within 90 day prior screen People dependency / employment sponsor investigator ( control question patient ) . . Pregnancy suspect pregnancy . Lack safe contraceptive measure ( see 5.4 ) .</criteria>
