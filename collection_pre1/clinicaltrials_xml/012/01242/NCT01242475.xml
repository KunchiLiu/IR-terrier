	<brief_summary>A new , specific skin test detect tuberculosis develop Statens Serum Institut Denmark . The new skin test name C-Tb like current Tuberculin positive test result show redness and/or swell injection site , negative test leave reaction . The aim study test C-Tb skin test healthy adult previously BCG vaccinate determine healthy non tuberculosis infect individual truly negative test result ( call determine specificity skin test ) . To able compare new skin test current Tuberculin skin test volunteer inject C-Tb TST skin test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial C-Tb Skin Test , When Given Intradermally Healthy Volunteers Previously Vaccinated With BCG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial design investigate specificity C-Tb various definition cut-off double blind randomise , split-body study compare 0.1 µg/0.1 mL C-Tb reference agent 2 T.U . Tuberculin PPD RT23 SSI . ( Each volunteer receive C-Tb agent one arm 2 T.U . Tuberculin PPD arm ) . The C-Tb 2 T.U . Tuberculin PPD agent give concomitantly volunteer RIGHT AND LEFT forearm accord double blind randomisation scheme . The primary objective trial ass specificity C-Tb test function cut-off value ( i.e. , small size induration measure mm result negative outcome C-Tb test ) test administer intradermally Mantoux technique healthy BCG vaccinate adult The specificity C-Tb test define relative frequency subject healthy population ( i.e. , exposure MTb ) induration response &lt; cut-off C-Tb test . Similarly sensitivity define relative frequency patient induration response ≥ cut-off TB patient . An optimal cut-off point infect determine comb result present specificity study parallel sensitivity study patient recently diagnose TB . The secondary objective trial compare induration response C-Tb induration response 2 T.U . Tuberculin PPD RT 23 SSI , compare induration response C-Tb in-vitro IFN-γ response measure screen 28 day injection skin test agent use QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube assay finally record adverse event occur within 28 day application agent .</detailed_description>
