	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) inherit disorder red blood cell . It common genetic disorder UK childhood stroke , 40 % child stroke ( clinical pick scan ) school age . Patients prone develop acute crisis necessitate hospital admission result long-term complication . Such event result considerable morbidity , disability mortality consequent burden patient , family , health service society whole . Doctors little ability predict get ill difficult know administer treatment . Furthermore little way treatment available mainstay prevention chronic blood transfusion programme expensive , require time work school fraught complication . This , population frequently educationally socially disadvantage outset . Recent evidence sickle cell disease diseases similar underlying process , point towards importance microparticles ( circulate break piece cell ) coagulation system important . By compare level particle molecule patient find healthy volunteer measure know important , study hope identify role improve management patient potentially lead way new therapy . Participants required donate small amount blood ( 1 teaspoon young , two old child adult ) . The investigator aim take sample possible people blood test case .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MACS Study - Microparticles Coagulation Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose design - Why need ? The purpose study try identify measurable parameter act disease indicator sickle cell disease . The reason parameter need although patient seem genetic defect , enormously different outcome range mild illness stroke , catastrophic chest disease , kidney failure death . Currently real tool properly prognosticate . This mean difficult know intervene illness scale stop treatment . The repercussion intervene timely manner catastrophic know child develop stroke future ongoing progressive intellectual deficit . The identification disease indicator could potential therapeutic innovation future . This important much current treatment blunt , expensive always effective . In addition paucity treatment option clinician available e.g . blood transfusion expensive socially financially , medical complication realistically available majority people sickle cell disease . - Why microparticles coagulation marker ? An excellent candidate role disease prognosticator coagulation marker microparticles . Microparticles coagulation marker show member investigative group elevate sickle cell disease paediatric vascular disease . There lot interest haematology world late particle paper presentation international conference - EHA ( European Haematology Association ) , BSH ( British Society Haematology ) ASH ( American Society Hematology ) , though perform small select group , frequently adult rarely sort control . What do far compare level ethnically match people measure child sickle cell disease . This remiss know vascular change occur right begin life child symptoms sign vasculopathy often 6 month age 40 % sort stroke school entry . What also omit perform test large cohort compare variety current measure disease severity measure vasculopathy . It kind information make proper inference importance measure go develop study use disease prognosticator one day even target therapeutic intervention . - Why ? Here present perfect opportunity study . Dr Trompeter author study coordinate study . She currently locum Consultant Haematologist UCLH Specialist Registrar Haemoglobinopathies Guy 's St Thomas ' look in- out-patients sickle cell disease sit . She also involve ongoing study sickle cell disease sit investigator . Furthermore work similar clinical capacity UCLH The Whittington Hospital build good rapport work relationship staff , patient family site . She register PhD UCL already perform assay part original ongoing study adult sickle cell disease , paper publish soon submit . These site combination represent one large cohort sickle cell patient country . The centre externally audit part sickle peer review considerable quality assess laud . They capacity , ability habit measure parameter interest study matter routine clinical care . The clinician enormous experience rapport patient also considerable research repertoire . The Professors scientist study demonstrate immense knowledge expertise field sickle cell disease vasculopathy internationally renown , lead many important related study . They provide much support scientific rationale design study . The investigator well know sickle community representative author spoken patient group persistently express desire medical advancement show real interest support study . This conglomeration sit , clinician , expert patient represent exciting opportunity advance understanding sickle cell disease . Recruitment - Participants identify Investigator ( part normal care team ) in- out-patient setting meet inclusion criterion . Patients sickle cell disease attend dedicate clinic well know investigator . The consent procedure describe . There payment . - In case patient , progress schedule blood test part normal clinic care , onto blood sample ( 1 teaspoon case small child , 2 teaspoon case old child adult ) obtain purpose study . - There two group healthy volunteer - adult child . They ethnically match . The majority adult identify sickle clinic set family member attend patient relative . These people additional advantage know sickle status . There also many ethnically matched member staff people attend hospital may want involved study . Some adult volunteer blood sample purpose study , others blood test case study sample take addition , know sickle status test . They consent separately information give back regard second test . Separate consent also take reporting G.P . also . Ethnically matched child healthy volunteer identify outpatient set . They extremely likely know sickle status case national screening programme . Children participate study blood test case .</detailed_description>
