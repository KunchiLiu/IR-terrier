	<brief_title>Radioimmunotherapy With 131I-L19SIP Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The L19SIP antibody fully human antibody , capable preferential localization around tumor blood vessel spar normal tissue . The formation new blood vessel rare event adult ( exception make female reproductive cycle ) , pathological feature aggressive type cancer . The study aim determine therapeutic potential L19SIP antibody SIP format , label radionuclide 131I , treatment patient different cancer type . The study follow Phase I study perform 131I-L19SIP 30 patient cancer , show excellent tolerability radioactive dos high 150 mCi therapeutic benefit patient enrol study .</detailed_description>
