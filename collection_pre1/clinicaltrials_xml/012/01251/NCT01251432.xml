	<brief_summary>This research study measure well Eustachian tube work look directly anatomy Eustachian tube adult tympanostomy tube surgically insert eardrum diagnose either `` otitis medium '' `` poor Eustachian tube function '' . The Eustachian tube biologic tube connect back nose middle ear ( airspace locate behind eardrum ) . That tube usually close , open swallowing activity . Periodic open Eustachian tube allow air flow nose middle ear keep pressure gas middle ear level atmosphere , condition require good hearing . In child adult , middle-ear disease otitis medium effusion ( buildup fluid within middle ear ) form temporary hearing loss ( conductive hearing loss ) occur Eustachian tube open , open frequently enough always open ( call patulous Eustachian tube ) . A diagnosis different condition make use standard , clinical test Eustachian tube function Eustachian tube visualize enters back nose use specialize telescope call endoscope . Some scientific report suggest cause poor Eustachian tube function individual determine study anatomy Eustachian tube back nose movement Eustachian tube area swallowing , talk activity use endoscope . In study , investigator plan explore relationship result standard Eustachian tube function test anatomy function Eustachian tube adult disease condition likely cause poor Eustachian tube function . Also , number disease condition ( example : nasal allergy , acid reflux disease ) relate poor Eustachian tube function possible condition effect Eustachian tube function treat medicine . Therefore , investigator also plan evaluate enrolled person condition . It expect result standard Eustachian tube function test explain anatomy back nose Eustachian tube , functional anatomy ( movement swallow etc ) Eustachian tube presence allergy or/acid reflux disease , new medical and/or surgical treatment develop improve Eustachian tube function `` cure '' treat associate middle-ear disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study require single visit Middle Ear Physiology Laboratory ( MEPL ) locate first floor Oakland Medical Building ( 3420 Fifth Avenue Oakland , Pittsburgh , PA ) . Adjacent park attached building available . The total time visit 2 hour . If subject eligible sign inform consent participate study , series question regard past history ear disease ask well whether subject several risk factor make people likely develop otitis medium effusion ear disease . The subject also complete short questionnaire ask question whether symptom consistent acid reflux disease . Then , blood sample ( 2/3 tablespoon ) take arm vein send laboratory assay chemical associate allergic disease . These procedure take 30 minute complete . Then , subject 's Eustachian tube function test ear/ears open tympanostomy tube eardrum . For test , subject seat comfortably chair soft rubber tube put partway ear canal . This tube attach machine change pressure ear measure pressure Eustachian tube open close , well easily air flow Eustachian tube easily subject open Eustachian tube swallow . These test require subject pull ear plug ear perform certain procedure design open Eustachian tube swallow open pinch nose , blow close nose deep breathing . The total time test 20 minute per ear . Then , study doctor apply topical medicine spray cotton ball inside nose decrease swell numb nose ( 4 % Lidocaine 0.05 % Oxymetazoline mixed 1:1 proportion ) . After short break 20 minute allow time medicine work , study doctor choose side subject 's nose open introduce small video telescope ( call endoscope ) side nose move back nose . This allow him/her see back nose Eustachian tube . He/she focus endoscope Eustachian tube record video image back nose , Eustachian tube rest movement Eustachian tube subject swallow , yawn , repeat `` O '' sound , repeat `` K '' sound move jaw . The subject able see movement Eustachian tube monitor perform procedure . This procedure take 40 minute complete . After test , study complete .</detailed_description>
