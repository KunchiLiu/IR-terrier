	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine low dose neem leaf extract ( NLE ) antileukemic effect acceptable toxicity patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . II . Establish safety toxicity NLE patient CLL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy NLE patient CLL define overall clinical response ( CR + PR ) IWCLL criterion . II . To develop pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model relate neem leaf extract exposure toxicity pharmacodynamic endpoint CLL patient allow personalize dose target optimal drug exposure . III . To conduct correlative study . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral Azadirachta indica daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
