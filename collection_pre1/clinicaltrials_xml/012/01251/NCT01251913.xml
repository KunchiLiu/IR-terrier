	<brief_summary>Background : - An important new area brain tumor research development tumor brain stem cell line . Successful growth cell line require obtain large volume fresh tumor brain tissue , best accomplish harvest whole brain recently decease patient . These cell line help researcher understand tumor develop also help identify new target treatment . Researchers interested conducting pilot study plan inpatient hospice care timely brain tumor tissue harvest time death . Objectives : - To provide high-quality end life inpatient hospice care patient untreatable brain tumor . - To procure brain tumor tissue shortly time death order derive viable tumor neural stem cell line research purpose . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age untreatable primary brain central nervous system tumor , able give inform consent ( either designate power attorney ) , agree Do Not Resuscitate order Consent Autopsy part end-of-life care plan . - HIV-positive individual suspect infectious cerebritis eligible potential contamination brain tissue . Design : - Participants enrol inpatient hospice admission National Institutes Health Clinical Center either home outside hospital study investigator estimate expect survival le 2 week . - Participants receive palliative care Clinical Center . Care tailor participant depend information provide individual 's end-of-life care plan . - Supportive medication antiseizure medication pain reliever administer appropriate . - At time death , researcher follow standard procedure notify next kin collect brain tissue tumor sample decease . - Following tissue collection , decease release autopsy funeral procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Inpatient Hospice With Procurement Brain Tumor Tissue Expiration Research Purposes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Patients treat Neuro-Oncology Branch ( NOB ) brain tumor unfortunately commonly succumb disease . They love one often seek way add mean utility death agree donate brain tumor tissue laboratory research may serve medical community , ultimately patient , good understand rare disease . Important new avenue brain tumor research include molecular characterization tumor tissue , development tumor neural stem cell line . Successful growth cell line require acquisition large volume fresh tumor brain tissue best accomplish harvest whole brain recently decease patient . In effort provide high quality end life care , additional intent facilitate efficient donation brain tumor tissue time death , conduct pilot study plan inpatient hospice care incorporate timely brain tumor tissue procurement time expiration . OBJECTIVES : - Provide high quality end life inpatient hospice care patient die untreatable brain tumor . - Procure brain tumor tissue shortly time death order derive viable tumor neural stem cell line research purpose . ELIGIBILITY : - Adult patient primary brain tumor . DESIGN : - This pilot study assess feasibility procure viable brain tumor tissue proximal time death . Target accrual 10 patient brain harvest .</detailed_description>
