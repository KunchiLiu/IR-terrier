	<brief_summary>Background : - Rates obesity increase dramatically recent decade , researcher investigate change diet physical activity contribute increase . To understand weight might control , important learn kind dietary change affect hunger might lower body weight . Essential fatty acid , instance , important part healthy diet , researcher yet determine ideal amount essential fatty acid people eat . By study different diet affect body chemistry hormone level woman overweight obese , researcher hope able determine well diet treatments help people reach maintain optimum healthy weight . Objectives : - To examine certain fat diet affect body metabolism , hormone , weight regulation . Eligibility : - Healthy woman 18 50 year age overweight obese ( body mass index 25 35 ) . Design : - This study initial screen visit three phase . All participant involve first two phase study , participant involve third phase . - Participants screen physical examination medical history , addition blood urine test questionnaires eat habit diet factor . - Phase 1 : Participants three visit National Institutes Health 4-week period . At visit , participant blood urine test , complete questionnaire , test include brain body image study . Participants assign one three study diet . - Phase 2 : Participants 12-week diet phase , food supply study researcher . Participants keep daily log food beverage intake , three test session procedure similar perform Phase 1 . - Phase 3 : Participants assign particular study diet ( one-third participant ) give option continue diet additional 36 week ( 9 month ) , food consumption , monitoring , test procedure similar perform Phase 2 ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dietary Essential Fatty Acid Regulation Omega-3 HUFA Metabolism ; Satiety Body Composition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective To evaluate effect lower dietary nutrient linoleic acid ( LA ) control variable : 1 ) tissue accretion omega-6 omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acid ( HUFA ) ; 2 ) bioactive endocannabinoids derive omega-6 HUFA arachidonic acid ( AA ) ; 3 ) insulin sensitivity ; 4 ) satiety hunger ; 5 ) body composition . Modifications dietary LA offset reciprocal change nutrient oleic acid ( OA ) maintain equivalency calorie nutrient . Study Population Up 180 overweight , otherwise healthy pre-menopausal woman volunteer ( age 18 50 ) body mass index ( BMI ) 25 35 kg/m ( 2 ) , enrol . With anticipated dropout rate describe Section 7.4 , anticipate 84 subject randomize study diet , 64 subject complete 12 week diet phase . Three Group Comparative Analysis A total 84 subject randomize one 3 healthy nutritionally complete diet differ fatty acid composition add visible oil . All food provide NIH metabolic kitchen , subject visit kitchen daily Monday Friday obtain food . Each Friday , subject carry home food pack weekend meal . Baseline test battery include : 1 ) blood composition omega-6 omega-3 HUFA ; 2 ) endocannabinoid , eicosanoid , docosanoid derivative omega-6 omega-3 HUFA ; 3 ) insulin function assessment ; 4 ) body composition assessment ; 4 ) functional satiety assessment ; 5 ) self-reported measure satiety , hunger affective state . The full baseline test battery repeat 84 day randomize treatment . An abbreviated testing battery perform 28 56 day randomize treatment . A subset participant undergo additional inpatient test 24-hour metabolic chamber describe Section 3.3.2 . The remain subject remain ambulatory throughout study . Participants advise continue usual medical care medication throughout study . 24-Hour Metabolic Suite Study A subset 8 participant 3 group undergo usual test battery additional metabolic test metabolic suite 0 , 28 , 84 day . The additional testing include pre- post-prandial endocrine hormone assessment . 36-Week Continuation ( Gradient Dose Replacement ) Sub Study At completion 84 day ( 12 week ) study , participant low LA group ( Group B ) option continue study diet another 252 day ( 36 week ) . Continuing subject consume randomize either : 1 ) low LA ( 1 en % ) diet . ; 2 ) baseline diet grade dose escalation LA , addition 1 en % LA every 6 week . In manner , LA increase incrementally 1 en % 8 en % 36 week period . During continuation phase , abbreviate test battery complete 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 30 week , full test battery repeat 36 week . Outcome Measures A Primary Dependent Variables The primary outcome proportion omega-6 HUFA total HUFA ( % omega-6 HUFA ) two endocannabinoids derive omega-6 AA , 2-Arachidonoylglycerol ( 2-AG ) N-Arachidonoylethanolamine ( Anandamide AEA ) . Secondary Dependent Variables Secondary outcome measure include blood concentration omega-6 HUFA Arachidonic Acid ( AA ) ; omega-3 HUFA Eicosapentaenoic Acid ( EPA ) Docosahexaenoic Acid ( DHA ) ; rate change % omega-6 HUFA , AA , EPA , DHA , 2-AG AEA time ; adipose muscle tissue fatty acid composition ; endocrine hormone ; gene expression profile ; psychometrics ; functional satiety ; 24-hr energy metabolism substrate utilization ; body composition , follow : Omega-6 omega-3 HUFA total fat content measure adipose muscle tissue biopsy . Other endocannabinoid , eicosanoid docosanoid derivative omega-6 omega-3 HUFA measure plasma via mass spectrometry . Endocrine hormone measure fast postprandial state 24-hour metabolic suite . Psychometric outcomes include self-reported measure satiety affective state . Functional satiety assess via buffet-style food array test . Body composition outcome include DEXA , 3T MRI , anthropometric measurement bioelectrical impedance . Genotyping also perform assess interaction select gene variant effect intervention .</detailed_description>
