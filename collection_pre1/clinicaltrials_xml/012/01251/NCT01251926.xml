	<brief_summary>Background : - The anticancer drug bevacizumab work reduce formation new blood vessel tumor , slow stop growth cancer cell support blood vessel . The experimental drug EZN-2208 work limit well cancer cell divide . Drugs similar EZN-2208 also work turn production HIF protein , otherwise help cancer cell grow even blood supply limit . Researchers interested determine EZN-2208 turn HIF patient tumor , whether combine bevacizumab effective treatment cancer respond standard treatment . Objectives : - To assess safety effectiveness combination EZN-2208 bevacizumab solid tumor respond standard treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age solid tumor respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen full physical examination medical history , blood urine sample , tumor image study . - Participants receive EZN-2208 bevacizumab intravenously outpatient basis 4-week cycle ( exception first cycle , 5 week ) . - Cycle 1 : Participants receive EZN-2208 week 3 week row ( day 1 , 8 , 15 ) , follow 1 week without drug . Participants receive bevacizumab 1 week EZN-2208 ( day - 7 ) 3 week later ( day 15 ) . - Subsequent cycle : Participants receive EZN-2208 week 3 week row ( day 1 , 8 , 15 ) , follow 1 week without drug . Participants receive bevacizumab every 2 week ( day 1 15 ) . - Participants clinic visit physical examination blood test first 3 week cycle . Clinic visit may also include tumor image study tumor biopsy direct study researcher . - Participants continue take study drug long tumor shrink grow , long experience intolerable unsafe side effect drug ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EZN-2208 ( Pegylated SN-38 ) Combination With Bevacizumab Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background One reason postulate limited efficacy anti-angiogenic anti-VEGF agent bevacizumab cause intra-tumoral hypoxia , result induction up-regulation hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) HIF-1Alpha . These turn play central role tumor progression act master regulator cancer cell adapt hypoxic condition . HIF-1Alpha therefore represent attractive target oncology . Camptothecin analogue ( include SN-38 , topotecan , irinotecan ) show consistently reduce translation , expression , transcriptional activity HIF-1Alpha vitro vivo , therefore potential inhibit HIF-1 ? induction occur anti-angiogenic agent . The central rationale study HIF-1alpha induction bevacizumab offset weekly administration EZN-2208 ( PEGylated SN-38 ) , result synergistic anti-tumor effect . Objectives Determine modulation HIF-1alpha protein ( ELISA ) solid tumor treatment EZN-2208 bevacizumab . Determine safety tolerability combination EZN-2208 bevacizumab EZN-2208 administer weekly time 3 ( Days 1 , 8 , 15 ) bevacizumab administer every 2 week 28-day cycle . Perform correlative study assess change angiogenesis tumor tissue . Evaluate antitumor response determine RECIST . Eligibility Adults histologically document solid tumor , whose disease progress follow standard therapy acceptable standard treatment . Performance status ECOG 0-2 ; adequate organ function ; life expectancy least 3 month ; major surgery , radiation chemotherapy within 4 week prior study enrollment ; recover toxicity prior therapy least eligibility level . Willingness undergo tumor biopsy research purpose . Study Design This single-arm pilot study . Patients receive EZN-2208 IV Day 1 , 8 , 15 28-day cycle dose 9 mg/m ( 2 ) ; bevacizumab administer IV every 2 week dose 5 mg/kg . For cycle 1 : Bevacizumab administer Day -7 ( i.e. , 1 week prior EZN-2208 ) Day 15 . For subsequent cycle : Bevacizumab administer Day 1 15 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically confirm ( Laboratory Pathology , NCI ) solid tumor metastatic unresectable standard therapy exist longer effective . There restriction prior therapy . Age great equal to18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use EZN2208 combination bevacizumab patient less 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric Phase I combination trial . ECOG performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 60 % Life expectancy great 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte great equal 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL platelet great equal 100,000/mcL total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal creatinine less equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 ( 2 ) patient creatinine level institutional normal . The effect EZN2208 develop human fetus unknown . For reason bevacizumab know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 3 month completion study . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Disease amenable biopsy , willingness undergo biopsy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients must ( Bullet ) 2 week since receive study drug participant Phase 0 study ( also refer early Phase I study subtherapeutic dose drug administer ) . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients diagnosis colorectal cancer , previously fail treatment topoisomerase I inhibitor . Patients types malignancy consider eligibility regardless prior exposure topoisomerase 1 inhibitor . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition EZN2208 bevacizumab . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , clinically significant cardiovascular disease define , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study bevacizumab antiangiogenic agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother EZN2208 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated EZN2208 . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction EZN2208 . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Urine protein screen urine analysis . If protein 2+ high , 24hour urine protein obtain level &lt; 1000 mg patient enrollment . Serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within past 6 month . Invasive procedure define follow : Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within past 28 day . Anticipation need major surgical procedure course study . Significant vascular disease ( e.g. , aortic aneurysm , require surgical repair recent peripheral arterial thrombosis ) within past 6 month . Known CNS disease except treated brain metastasis . Treated brain metastasis define ongoing requirement steroid evidence progression hemorrhage treatment least 3 month , ascertain clinical examination brain imaging ( MRI CT ) . Patients receive EIAED anticonvulsant eligible participate ( Appendix B ) . Patients nonEIAED may enrol discretion PI . Treatment brain metastasis may include whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) , radiosurgery ( RS ; Gamma Knife , LINAC , equivalent ) , combination deem appropriate treating physician . Patients clinically significant cardiovascular disease exclude : Inadequately control hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg despite antihypertensive medication ) History stroke/cerebrovascular accident within 6 month Myocardial infarction unstable angina within 6 month New York Heart Association grade II great congestive heart failure Serious inadequately control cardiac arrhythmia Significant vascular disease ( e.g. , aortic aneurysm , history aortic dissection ) Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease Evidence bleed diathesis coagulopathy .
