	<detailed_description>The aim pharmaco-MRI study investigate neural correlate variable antidepressant treatment response drive genetic variation multiple gene involve depression . Thirty Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) patient concurrent major depressive episode undergo three MRI scan session baseline , 4 hour 8 week escitalopram treatment initiation . During MRI session , one structural 3 fMRI scan engage different brain circuitry perform . All subject undergo extensive behavioral assessment genotyped . Furthermore , potential peripheral marker lymphocyte mRNA pharmacological parameter platelet lymphocyte assess . The investigator expect genetic variant associate variable response SSRIs previous Imaging Genetics study modulate neural target drug response . Moreover , peripheral marker expect correlate brain region measurement . Imaging measure suggest superior drug response assessment compare psychometric scale , hardly correlate biological parameter . Since image technique expensive sophisticated broad clinical use , study provide pilot data peripheral biomarkers neural activation relate drug response . Furthermore , study demonstrate whether genotype impact dynamic neural drug response vivo .</detailed_description>
