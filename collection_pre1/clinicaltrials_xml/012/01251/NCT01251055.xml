	<brief_summary>The etiology schizophrenia remain unclear In recent one decade , hypofunction N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor implicate pathophysiology schizophrenia . Hence , enhance NMDA neurotransmission consider new approach schizophrenia treatment . To date , refractory schizophrenia ( particularly clozapine-resistant ) still difficult clinical issue . However , effect NMDA treatment refractory schizophrenia still unknown . Therefore , primary goal study investigate efficacy safety NMDA adjuvant therapy refractory schizophrenia , identify predictor treatment response NMDA enhancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The etiology schizophrenia remain unclear . In recent one decade , hypofunction N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor implicate pathophysiology schizophrenia . Hence , enhance NMDA neurotransmission consider new approach schizophrenia treatment . To date , pilot study explore efficacy NMDA enhancer adjuvant therapy schizophrenia , instance , D-serine ( endogenous agonist NMDA-glycine site ) . They well-tolerated also synergistic improve positive , negative cognitive symptom receive typical atypical antipsychotic ( except clozapine ) . Refractory schizophrenia ( particularly clozapine-resistant ) still difficult clinical issue present . Previous study reveal add-on treatment D-serine agonist NMDA receptor fail give significant benefit patient . The primary goal study investigate efficacy safety glycine transporter ( GlyT ) -1 inhibitor adjuvant therapy refractory schizophrenia , identify predictor treatment response NMDA enhancer .</detailed_description>
