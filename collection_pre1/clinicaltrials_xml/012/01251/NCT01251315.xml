	<brief_summary>Glutathione powerful protective substance find within every cell body . It show glutathione level go person get old , make person likely get heart disease , high blood sugar problem different kind cancer . N-Acetyl Cysteine use dietary supplement . It report increase glutathione level body . The diet supplement call ProImmune also change body glutathione . Therefore , purpose study find effect ProImmune healthy people . This study also help prove whether ProImmune able improve blood level glutathione healthy people .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Glutathione ( gamma-glutamyl-cysteine-glycine ; GSH ) powerful antioxidant found within every cell . GSH predominantly know protect cell damage cause free radical . The concentration glutathione decline age , stress , age-related disease . When glutathione become deficient , series event initiate term `` oxidative stress '' associate cell signal lead impair immune function similar abnormality numerous cell system . Oral glutathione ineffective replenish glutathione level reverse abnormal signal pathway associate oxidative stress . Intravenous glutathione show effective short-lived . N-Acetyl Cysteine , glutathione precursor , limited efficacy clinical setting suffers adverse effect profile.Null Hypothesis ( primary ) : The administration FT061452 increase serum intracellular glutathione level comparison N-Acetyl Cysteine ( NAC ) , placebo . Null Hypothesis ( secondary ) : The administration FT061452 improve vascular function comparison N-Acetyl Cysteine ( NAC ) , placebo . The Specific Aims pilot study : - Compare change serum intracellular glutathione level follow administration novel oral glutathione precursor , FT061452 , ( modify glutathione selenium add , cystine replace cysteine , dose equivalent NAC ) compare low dose usual dose NAC , placebo . - Compare change select clinical parameter ( vascular function ) follow administration novel oral glutathione precursor , FT061452 , ( modify glutathione selenium add , cystine replace cysteine ) compare N-Acetyl Cysteine ( NAC ) , placebo . - As pilot study third goal generate effect size appropriately powering future clinical trial . Background : Increased rate adverse health outcome racial ethnic minority link confluence socio-cultural , environmental , immunological , genetic base factor , frequently act concert . Ultimately , majority factor lead adverse physiologic cellular change . However , chronic activation neurohormonal system stress lead maladaptive health consequence accelerate apoptosis , atherogenesis , alter immune function , dysregulations cellular function . Ultimately , stress relate cellular activity contribute many observed premature chronic disease human , many find disproportionately high rate minority community . Glutathione major regulator cellular oxidative state buffer many stress related pathway . When glutathione become deficient occurs increase reactive oxidative specie ( ROS ) collectively term `` oxidative stress '' . Clinically , oral glutathione ( GSH ) ineffective replenish glutathione level reverse associate abnormal cellular signaling . GSH whole molecule take cell mammals largely metabolized gastrointestinal tract constituent amino acid , include highly oxidizable L-cysteine , re-united extracellularly glutathione re-assimilation require two cytosolic , ATP-dependent enzyme . Thus , process achieve glutathione synthesis require special condition present within cell . Oral glutathione preparation limit ability provide adequate substrate stimulate intracellular glutathione synthesis due L-cysteine highly oxidizable . Intravenous glutathione administration expensive , short-lived , impractical , transiently high plasma concentration largely independent intracellular glutathione activity , much oxidative balance perform . N-Acetyl Cysteine ( NAC ) , glutathione precursor , limited efficacy clinical setting suffers adverse side-effect profile . However , preliminary finding novel glutathione precursor vitamin implication ( FT061452 ) indicate affect metabolism glutathione via 2 mechanism : 1 ) increase availability intracellular cysteine use stable cystine physiologic stable cysteine carrier traverse cell membrane create optimal Cys/CySS redox state , 2 ) add selenium , important co-factor glutathione reductase . Thus , FT061452 appear provide great cellular delivery substrate attenuate oxidative stress , comparison traditional glutathione precursor , despite show promise , demonstrate consistent clinical efficacy . Preliminary study ; Preliminary study investigate GSH several GSH analog might protect spermine-induced apoptosis aortic vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) promising . Given spermine ( uremic toxin ) increase intracellular ROS promote apoptosis cultured cell , first examine generation ROS along intracellular level reduce GSH ratio reduce GSH oxidize glutathione ( GSH/GSSG ) VSMC response spermine treatment attenuation concomitant administration similar strength GSH , NAC FT061452 . While concomitant exposure cell NAC , GSH , FT061452 attenuate spermine-induced decrease GSH level , addition novel glutathione precursor , FT061452 , spermine treat cell increase intracellular GSH level control value . Study Design &amp; Method : This prospective randomized control pilot study , include twenty-four ( 24 ) healthy individual age 30-65 year old . The study occur course two day . On Day 1 , potential subject screen determine eligibility mini history physical exam , complete blood count ( CBC ) complete metabolic panel ( CMP ) . On Day 2 , eligible subject report Participant Clinical Interactions Resource Center ( formerly know CRC ) fast overnight . The first 12 subject ( low dose ) randomize three group , 1 ) give single dose placebo , 2 ) give 600 mg ( low dose ) N-Acetyl Cysteine ( NAC ) 3 ) give 3000 mg study drug ( FT061452 ) . Serum intracellular glutathione level , biomarkers , non-invasive measure vascular function assess baseline , 2 , 4 6 hour . During stay CRC , subject every group feed meal . The second 12 subject ( usual dose ) randomize three group , 1 ) give single dose placebo , 2 ) give 1200 mg ( usual dose ) N-Acetyl Cysteine ( NAC ) 3 ) give 6000 mg study drug ( FT061452 ) . Serum intracellular glutathione level , biomarkers , non-invasive measure vascular function assess baseline , 2 , 4 6 hour . During stay CRC , subject every group feed meal . At baseline , 2 , 4 6 hour , blood sample ( 15 cc per draw ) obtain serum intracellular glutathione level , store serum biomarkers , non-invasive measure vascular function assess baseline 6 hour , follow : 1 ) Pulse wave velocity Augmentation Index ( via SphygmoCor ) : ( central artery pressure central aortic pulse pressure ) 2 ) Peripheral vascular endothelial function ( via EndoPat ) : ( % flow mediate dilation ) . This study potential benefit others . The knowledge gain provide realistic practical information guide implementation non-pharmacological intervention reduce progression age related morbidity . Because CDU 's community largely minority , community color include recruitment . The IRB exercise oversight protocols involve human subject , monitor adverse event , performs audit approve protocol .</detailed_description>
