	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give bicalutamide without Akt inhibitor MK2206 work treat patient previously treat prostate cancer . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , bicalutamide , may lessen amount androgen make body . Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether bicalutamide effective without Akt inhibitor MK2206 treat prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bicalutamide With Without Akt Inhibitor MK2206 Treating Patients With Previously Treated Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare two regimen proportion patient undetectable prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level ( &lt; 0.2 ng/mL ) 44 week . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess proportion patient PSA decline &gt; = 85 % 44 week combination therapy arm compare bicalutamide monotherapy arm . II . To assess distribution best PSA response study arm . III . To assess time PSA progression arm study . IV . To assess time PSA nadir arm study . V. To assess duration PSA response arm study . VI . To characterize PSA slope pre-study , treatment , treatment . VII . To evaluate safety tolerability MK-2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK2206 ) patient population . VIII . To determine whether Gleason score effect PSA response treatment . IX . To determine whether prior hormonal therapy effect PSA response treatment . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Samples primary tumor specimen retrieve banking future analysis molecular profile primary prostate cancer ( PC ) tissue emphasis androgen receptor ( AR ) protein kinase B ( Akt ) upstream downstream signaling pathway . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients undergo observation week 1-12 . Patients receive bicalutamide* orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) week 13-44 . Patients PSA decline &gt; = 50 % may continue bicalutamide week 72 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206** PO per week week 1-44 bicalutamide* PO QD week 13-44 . Patients PSA decline &gt; = 50 % may continue MK2206 bicalutamide week 72 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients may begin bicalutamide week 4-11 disease worsens . NOTE : **Patients Akt inhibitor MK2206 PSA &lt; 0.2 ng/mL week 12 receive bicalutamide PSA rise &gt; = 0.2 ng/mL . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , every year 10 year .</detailed_description>
