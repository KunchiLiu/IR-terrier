	<brief_title>Phase l/II Study Ruxolitinib Acute Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Ruxolitinib design block gene mutation may important cancer cell growth survival . By block gene mutation , may cause cancer cell die . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 30 participant enrol Phase I portion study , 136 participant enrol Phase II . If enrolled Phase I portion , dose ruxolitinib receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level ruxolitinib . Each new group receive high dose ruxolitinib group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose ruxolitinib find . If enrol Phase II portion , receive ruxolitinib high dose tolerate Phase I portion lower dose . Study Drug Administration : You take ruxolitinib tablet ( ) mouth 2 time day Days 1-28 28-day study cycle . You ask keep diary record dose take . You ask bring diary unused drug next visit . Study Visits : On Days 1 , 7 , 14 , 21 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ask treatment may , drug may take , side effect may . - On Day 14 , bone marrow aspiration perform check status disease . On Day 1 Cycle 2 : - You physical exam . - You ask treatment may , drug may take , side effect may . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You bone marrow aspiration perform check status disease . During Cycles 2 beyond , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test least every 1-2 week . This blood may draw clinic close home . On Day 1 Cycles 3 , 6 , 9 , beyond : - You physical exam . - You ask treatment may , drug may take , side effect may . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You bone marrow aspiration perform check status disease . On Day 1 Cycle 3 , do doctor think need . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Your participation study complete end-of-study visit follow-up call . End-of-Study Visit : After last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - You ask treatment may , drug may take , side effect may . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You bone marrow aspiration perform check status disease . Follow-Up : About one month end-of-study visit , study staff call ask side effect may . This call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Ruxolitinib FDA approve commercially available treatment intermediate high-risk myelofibrosis , include primary myelofibrosis , post-polycythemia vera ( post-PV ) myelofibrosis post-essential thrombocythemia ( post-ET ) myelofibrosis . Its use treat acute leukemia investigational . Up 166 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
