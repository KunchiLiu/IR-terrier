	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose veliparib give together carboplatin see well work treat patient human epidermal growth factor 2 ( HER2 ) -negative breast cancer spread part body . Carboplatin kill cancer cell damage deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) let cancer cell survive reproduce . The body proteins try repair damage DNA . Veliparib may prevent protein repair DNA carboplatin may able kill tumor cell . Giving veliparib carboplatin may kill tumor cell carboplatin alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase II dose veliparib along carboplatin 14-day 21-day schedule patient Her2 negative metastatic breast cancer estrogen receptor ( ER ) /progesterone receptor ( PR ) negative ER and/or PR positive defect Fanconi Anemia ( FA ) pathway repair gene . II . To determine safety tolerability combine veliparib 14-day 21-day schedule carboplatin patient population . III . To determine preliminary efficacy combination patient population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacodynamic endpoint poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibition tumor use , A ) 3'- [ F-18 ] fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine positron emission tomography ( FLT-PET ) target lesion , B ) circulate tumor cell detect induction histone variant gamma H2AX , C ) peripheral blood mononuclear cell assess poly ADP-Ribose ( PAR ) level . II . To determine biomarkers primary tumor may predict antitumor response PARP inhibition breast cancer 1/2 , early onset ( BRCA ) 1/2 protein , Fanconi anemia , complementation group D2 ( FANCD2 ) nuclear foci formation expression micro-ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) 155 ( miR 155 ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study veliparib . Patients receive carboplatin intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 week .</detailed_description>
