	<brief_summary>This phase II clinical trial study well gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 ( RO4929097 ) autologous stem cell transplant work treat patient multiple myeloma . Giving chemotherapy , melphalan , autologous stem cell transplant stop growth cancer cell stop divide kill . Before treatment , stem cell collect patient 's blood store . After chemotherapy , stem cell return patient replace blood-forming cell destroy chemotherapy . RO4929097 may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving RO4929097 autologous stem cell transplant may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy RO4929097 eradicate residual/persistent disease ( conversion VGPR CR sCR status ) multiple myeloma patient status post single high-dose melphalan/autologous stem cell rescue residual/persistent disease post-transplant . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety single agent RO4929097 post-autologous stem cell transplant multiple myeloma patient . II . To analyze Notch receptor ligand protein expression pre-transplant , pre-treatment RO4929097 , post-treatment bone marrow biopsy sample . III . To isolate identify clonogenic multiple myeloma progenitor cell bone marrow aspirate and/or peripheral blood follow time point : pre-transplant , day 100 post-transplant , post-treatment stag bone marrow biopsy . IV . To analyze Notch receptor ligand protein expression isolate clonogenic progenitor myeloma cell . V. To characterize tumor xenograft-initiating potential clonogenic myeloma cell adult Casper zebrafish SCID-hu model evaluate drug toxicity therapeutic potential RO4929097 model . VI . To analyze anti-angiogenic effect RO4929097 measure reduction microvessel density VEGFR-1 expression pre-treatment post-treatment bone marrow biopsy sample . VII . To determine whether measurement soluble surrogate marker angiogenesis prior follow treatment RO4929097 provide early marker disease response Notch inhibition . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION AND CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients undergo standard mobilization collection autologous peripheral stem cell ( &gt; = 4.0 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg ) . Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV day -3 -2 undergo autologous stem cell transfusion day 0 . Patients progressive disease , stable disease , partial response , stringent complete response , complete response take study ; patient residual/persistent disease ( good partial response [ VGPR ] * ) continue therapeutic treatment . NOTE : *Patients meet criterion VGPR finding abnormal bone marrow cytogenetic study demonstrate &gt; = 10 % metaphase cell positive either high-risk chromosomal abnormality persistent disease-related chromosomal abnormality ( e.g. , chromosome del 13 ; del17p , ( 4 ; 14 ) , ( 14 ; 16 ) , ( 6 ; 14 ) complex cytogenetics ) repeat bone marrow biopsy assessment cytogenetics within 2-3 week . If repeat biopsy finding suggest persistent high-risk cytogenetic finding , patient consider eligible receive RO4929097 eradicate residual disease . THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT : Beginning 100-110 day transplantation , patient receive oral RO4929097 daily day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 4 week .</detailed_description>
