	<brief_summary>The choice prefer first-line treatment require balance desire optimal disease control occurrence early late treatment-related effect . To fully assess balance , treatment decision process ideally take account outcome follow consistent second-line therapy , particular tolerate , widely applicable highly effective salvage regimen exist , like Hodgkin lymphoma fail initial chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing ABVD v BEACOPP Advanced Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During last two decade ABVD ( doxorubicin , bleomycin , vinblastine , dacarbazine ) consider standard care advance HL , however 20-30 % patient fail achieve durable complete remission need salvage treatment . After state-of-the art-salvage program include high-dose chemotherapy autologous hematopoietic stem cell support ( ASCT ) least half patient achieve durable disease control . Recently German Hodgkin Study Group ( GHSG ) develop new regimen , BEACOPP ( bleomycin , etoposide , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , vincristine , procarbazine prednisone ) , administer without dose escalation . In interim analysis 23 month follow-up , BEACOPP demonstrate high activity compare COPP/ABVD superior freedom treatment failure ( 84 % versus 75 % , P=.034 ) . Despite improved efficacy substantial proportion patient receive escalate BEACOPP experience severe acute hematologic toxicity ( grade 3-4 leucopoenia , thrombocytopenia anemia occur 78 % , 36 % 27 % cycle administer , respectively ) 1.8 % fatal acute toxicity report . Moreover great concern incidence almost fatal secondary acute leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome ( 3 case 323 patient ) . The choice first-line treatment require balance desire optimal disease control occurrence early late treatment-related toxicity . Long-term outcome follow optimal salvage treatment , consist high-dose chemotherapy ASCT also take consideration . In present study plan compare efficacy toxicity two therapeutic strategy consist two different first-line treatment follow pre-planned salvage program , indicate</detailed_description>
