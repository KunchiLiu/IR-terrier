	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safe use store autologous Human Umbilical Cord Blood ( hUCB ) treat pediatric patient sustain severe moderate Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) , fully recover measure Glasgow Outcome Score-Expanded ( GOS-EC ) /Child 6 18 month post-injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Umbilical Cord Blood To Treat Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury primary cause pediatric trauma relate morbidity mortality . Currently reparative therapeutic option available , intervention design prevent injury progression secondary brain injury . Pre-clinical data suggest progenitor cellular infusion may reduce severity injury number propose mechanism . The current study propose Phase 1 Safety Trial use store autologous UCB treat patient sustain severe moderate TBI , fully recover measure Glasgow Outcome Score-Expanded/Child 6 18 month post-injury . We choose use one bank use standardized processing storage protocol reduce cell product variability . Families bank hUCB Cord Blood Registry , Inc. ( CBR ) , prospectively notify possibility use child 's stored UCB sustain moderate severe TBI persistent deficit 6-18 month . Prior enrol study , patient medical record , image study review , telephone interview determine potential eligibility exclusion criterion . If eligible , patient travel Houston undergo medical history physical exam , neuropsychiatric evaluation , DT-MRI image brain , baseline laboratory evaluation . The UCB ship Center Cell Gene Therapy reanimation characterization/determination release criterion cell product ( contamination-free ) . The UCB infuse intravenously patient monitor in-patient Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) locate within Children 's Memorial Hermann Hospital 24 hour , patient discharge return next day final examination . Follow-up visit occur back UT-Houston 180 day , 1 year 2 year post-infusion - visit include medical history physical exam , neurological neuropsych evaluation , DT-MRI image brain .</detailed_description>
