	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) one serious frequent complication general anesthesia . Patients suffer chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) predispose develop AKI . CKD patient often need surgical intervention do general anesthesia ; therefore increase probability develop AKI . N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , thiol compound antioxidant vasodilatory property , reduces oxygen free radical production , decrease pump-related ischemia-reperfusion injury level pro-inflammatory cytokine . NAC report protect kidney injury induce contrast medium , ischemia , toxin . Present study aim explore efficacy NAC treatment prevent deterioration renal functioning CKD patient undergo major surgery general anesthesia . Study include 200 CKD ( eGFR ( estimate glomerular filtration rate ) le 40 ) patient undergo surgical intervention general anesthesia divide 3 group follow : group 1- 40 patient undergo major vascular surgery ; group 2 - 60 patient suppose undergo major orthopedic surgery ( revision total hip , revision knee ) ; group 3 - 100 patient undergoing major abdominal surgery . Patients group randomly divide two sub-groups ( A B ) . Subgroup A receive NAC twice ( 14-16h 2h ) surgery 12h surgery . Subgroup B receive placebo ( saline ) . Markers kidney function eGFR , creatinin , urea , electrolyte , cystatin C , NGAL ( Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin ) , urine albumin measure surgery patient . An additional blood sample assessment nitric oxide cytokine level take patient surgery .</brief_summary>
