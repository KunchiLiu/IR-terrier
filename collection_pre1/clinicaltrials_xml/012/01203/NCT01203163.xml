	<brief_summary>Three main adverse reaction , namely photosensitivity ( reaction similar sunburn ) , oesophageal stenosis ( narrowing closure food pipe ) , perforation treat area ( tear puncture tissue ) , identify research study evaluate photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) porfimer sodium . Because low incidence disease variation occurrence adverse reaction among different indication , difficult determine occurrence frequency safety issue routine clinical practice . This post-marketing safety surveillance registry set-up evaluate safety PDT use porfimer sodium . A registry allow collection data evaluate real-world result practice medicine . The registry monitor patient 's health event , main focus photosensitivity , oesophageal stenosis , perforation treat area . This registry involve 500 patient , across 20 36 hospital US Europe , schedule receive injection porfimer sodium PDT treatment lung cancer , esophageal [ food pipe ] cancer , high-grade dysplasia ( HGD ) ( precancerous change food pipe tissue ) Barrett 's esophagus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Case Analysis Real Life Incidence Photodynamic Therapy ( PDT ) Safety Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients enrol registry upon injection porfimer sodium . During normal medical examination , criterion entry onto registry verify confirm eligibility , medical procedure include demographic information , disease history , medical history , physical exam , clinical laboratory test perform normal practice collect . Patients receive PDT per current practice repeat per physician 's judgment . All patient assess per current practice , usually least three time , PDT session . Additional visit seek patient present photosensitivity reaction , esophageal stenosis , perforation site laser light application , unresolved serious adverse reaction third visit treatment . All patient request physician complete two-part Daily Diary record adverse reaction use check-list form general section report adverse event intake concomitant medication time adverse event .</detailed_description>
