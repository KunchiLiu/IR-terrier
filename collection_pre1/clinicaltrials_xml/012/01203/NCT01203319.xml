	<brief_title>The Immunogenicity Safety 60mcg/30mcg Recombinant Hepatitis B Vaccines People Who Failed Respond Routine Administration Hepatitis B Vaccines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effective method prevent hepatitis B virus infection receive vaccination hepatitis b vaccine get protective antibody anti-HBs . Both blood-derived hepatitis B vaccine recombinant hepatitis B vaccine prove effective safe since application 1981 1989 respectively . Previous passive active immunization testis indicate low effective level anti-HBs prevention infection 10mIU/ml . However still recipient ca n't generate expect level anti-HBs vaccination . In adult , 5 % 10 % recipient fail respond routine administration 10mcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine , nonresponders susceptible population even vaccination . In study , recipient whose peak period ( 1 month vaccination ) level anti-HBs low 10mIU/ml finishing vaccination 3 dose 10mcg hepatitis b vaccine call nonresponders . Nowadays , lot test conduct nonresponders help generate protective antibody anti-HBs , include increase antigen dosage vaccine , increase injection vaccine , change route inoculation use adjuvant . Unfortunately , previous study get coincident persuasive outcome due small sample size poor representativeness . This study plan evaluate immunogenicity safety 60mcg/30mcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine people age 16 old fail respond routine administration 10mcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine provide scientific evidence revaccination strategy China .</detailed_description>
