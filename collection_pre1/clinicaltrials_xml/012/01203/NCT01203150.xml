	<detailed_description>Obesity obesity-related secondary complication pandemic health hazard highly prevalent among person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . Accumulation body fat disposes person SCI accelerate endocrine cardiovascular disease , well pain , functional decline , diminish health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) . While use combine resistance endurance exercise person without disability remedy many problem associated disorder , widespread use person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) must first satisfy scientific burden effectiveness . The investigator adopt term `` obesity-related secondary complication '' describe accumulation body fat cluster secondary CVD risk , recognize threshold criterion diagnosis obesity person SCI remain ill-defined . For purpose proposal , `` -related '' part term confers physical deconditioning , hypertension , fast dyslipidemia , post-prandial lipemia ( PPL ) , impaired insulin sensitivity , report person SCI . Contextualized , risk occur independently cluster would cause immediate therapeutic lifestyle intervention ( TLI ) , frank medical treatment . Given early understanding effective treatment risk , improvement severity would CVD risk-reducing thus life-benefiting function-preserving . The investigator expect research finding improve understand risk obesity obesity-related secondary complication future intervention well target , identify exercise intervention attend current health risk , clarify whether nutrient supplementation improve risk-lessening benefit exercise , identify exercise timing intensity best enhance fat utilization , expand understand interrelated nature risk factor SCI .</detailed_description>
