	<brief_summary>The European Surgical Outcomes Study ( EuSOS ) multi-centre , international cohort study peri-operative care clinical outcome patient undergo non-cardiac surgery . Participating centre throughout Europe contribute routine clinical data describe eligible patient undergo surgery 4th April 2011 11th April 2011 . Patients follow hospital discharge ( maximum 60 day ) duration hospital stay hospital mortality . Routine clinical data also collect patient admit critical care stage surgery hospital admission . Specific objective describe clinical outcome standard peri-operative care patient undergo non-cardiac surgery Europe .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research question 1 . What in-hospital mortality rate patient undergo non-cardiac surgery Europe ? 2 . What duration hospital stay patient undergo non-cardiac surgery Europe ? 3 . What current standard peri-operative critical care provision patient undergo non-cardiac surgery Europe ? 4 . What current standard haemodynamic ( cardiac output ) monitoring patient undergo non-cardiac surgery Europe ? 5 . Is evidence difference standard peri-operative care provision patient undergo non-cardiac surgery different health-care system within Europe ? 6 . Is evidence difference hospital stay mortality patient undergo major non-cardiac surgery different health-care system within Europe ? 7 . What factor determine plan unplanned admission critical care surgery ? 8 . Are factor associate critical care admission similar associate post-operative death ? Methods International cohort study adult patient undergoing in-patient non-cardiac surgery 4th April 2011 11th April 2011 . Centres The investigator aim recruit many European centre possible anticipate minimum 150 hundred centre ten nation require . Ethics approval National co-ordinators responsible clarify need ethic approval apply appropriate . Centres permit record data unless ethic approval equivalent waiver place . This study effect large scale clinical audit . The investigator expect , every participate country , requirement individual patient consent data anonymised already record part routine clinical care . Data collection Data collect describe eligible patient undergo surgery within seven day cohort period . These patient follow hospital discharge . Data fully anonymised transcribed local investigator onto internet base electronic CRF . A centre specific form complete hospital provide data include university/non-university hospital , number operating room , number level critical care bed , etc . Data set An operating room data sheet complete patient recruit include data describe patient factor ( age , gender , American Society Anesthesiologists grade , major co-morbid disease , etc ) , surgical factor ( procedure category , grade urgency surgery , grade surgeon , surgical checklist , etc ) , anaesthetic factor ( anaesthetic technique , haemodynamic monitoring , airway , grade anaesthetist , etc ) , post-operative care ( post-operative recovery ward stay , post-operative invasive non-invasive ventilation inotrope within first 24 hour ) . A critical care data sheet complete patient admit critical care time surgery , include data describe whether admission plan unplanned , organ support , SAPS III score SOFA score etc ) . Patients follow death hospital discharge follow outcome : duration critical care stay , critical care mortality , duration hospital stay in-hospital mortality . Sample size calculation The investigator anticipate approximately 20,000 patient require provide sample 2,000 admission critical care surgery . Assuming overall mortality rate follow surgery 1 % , sample size 20,000 patient yield 200 death . This allow inclusion least fifteen variable logistic regression model mortality . The rate admission critical care likely vary nation overall rate 10 % yield data describe 2000 admission critical care , whilst overall rate 5 % yield 1000 admission . This allow construction robust logistic regression model outcome . 20,000 patient also provide &gt; 99 % confidence overall mortality rate 0.37 % confidence width . If 200 death observe overall sample 20,000 patient , 99 % confidence interval proportion would ( 0.008 - 0.012 ) confidence width 0.37 % . This dataset would also sufficient generalisability inform practice peri-operative care international basis . Statistical analysis The data collect collected part routine clinical care . Categorical variable describe proportion compare use chi-square Fisher 's exact test . Continuous variable describe mean standard deviation normally distributed median inter-quartile range normally distribute . Comparisons continuous variable perform use one-way ANOVA Mann-Whitney test appropriate . Univariate analysis perform test factor associate plan unplanned admission critical care / in-hospital death . A multiple logistic regression model use identify independent risk factor . A stepwise approach use enter new term logistic regression model p &lt; 0.05 set limit inclusion new term . A logistic regression model perform assess independent association prognostic factor outcomes . Results logistic regression report adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) 95 % confidence interval . A single final analysis plan end study . Organisation The study conduct EuSOS study group behalf European Society Intensive Care Medicine European Society Anaesthesiology . National co-ordinators lead project within individual nation identify participate hospital , translate study paperwork , distribute study paperwork ensure necessary regulatory approval place . Local co-ordinators lead EuSOS study individual institution ensure relevant regulatory approval place adequate training staff . They supervise data collection , ensure timely data return act guarantor integrity quality data collect .</detailed_description>
