	<brief_title>Vitamin A Supplementation Extremely-Low-Birth-Weight Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infants extremely low birth weight ( â‰¤1,000 g ) low plasma tissue concentration vitamin A , vitamin A deficiency may predispose infant chronic lung disease . A meta-analysis clinical trial vitamin A supplementation preterm infant reveal 17 % increase rate survival without chronic lung disease , approach statistical significance . This multi-site , randomized trial conduct determine safety effectiveness high dose vitamin A used previous trial extremely-low-birth-weight ( ELBW ) infant . We hypothesize vitamin A supplementation would increase rate survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia reduce risk sepsis . Infants birth weight 401-1000g receive mechanical ventilation supplemental oxygen 24-96 hour age enrol . Subjects randomize either vitamin A control group . Infants Vitamin A group give dose 5000 IU ( 0.1 ml ) intramuscularly Mondays , Wednesdays , Fridays four week . Control infants receive sham procedure rather placebo injection . Serum vitamin A measured central laboratory base line 28 day first 300 infant . On study day 28 ( two three day last treatment immediately blood sample collect ) , relative dose-response evaluate .</detailed_description>
