	<brief_summary>Incisional hernia primarily repair use prosthetic mesh . In Switzerland mesh mainly implant via open laparoscopic approach . The differential impact two type surgical technique recurrence rate investigate study . With multicenter cohort study outcomes laparoscopic open incisional hernia repair investigate prospectively . Hernia recurrence main outcome measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prophylactic Mesh Implantation Prevention Incisional Hernia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Incisional hernia one common complication general abdominal surgery . An overall incidence 20 % find retrospective study , range 50 % patient select risk factor obesity . In general surgical patient current standard closure abdominal wall use run , slowly absorbable suture . With well establish clinical practice incidence remain high incisional hernia repair must perform frequently order treat patient ` symptom prevent progression hernia possible complication . Consequently , high risk patient prophylactic mesh implantation perform routinely institution . Objective - Occurrence least two follow factor : - Male gender - Malignant tumor present - Body mass index 25kg/m2 - Previous laparotomy - Elective operation - Patient &gt; 18 year - Written inform consent Methods Prospective , two arm , control , randomize study</detailed_description>
