	<brief_summary>Clopidogrel reduce risk cardiovascular disease inhibit platelet aggregation . It metabolize active drug liver enzyme . Its efficacy may measure blood sample platelet activity , analyze VerifyNow device . Calcium Channel blocker ( CCB ) also commonly use blood pressure anginal control patient . Dihydropyridine group calcium channel blocker ( e.g . amlodipine ) inhibit enzyme . There observational study report dihydropyridine CCB reduce clopidogrel effect , clinical implication unclear . This study test hypothesis significant effect dihydropyridines CCB clopidogrel response compare control . After give consent , patient suboptimal blood pressure anginal control randomize receive either dihydropyridine CCB non-CCB placebo . These patient follow-up 1 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clopidogrel pro-drug , require hepatic transformation cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4 generate active metabolite . It inhibit adenosine-5-diphosphate ( ADP ) -induced platelet aggregation irreversibly block platelet P2Y12 receptor . However , response clopidogrel show wide individual variability , patient high on-treatment residual ADP-induced platelet reactivity increase risk adverse cardiovascular event . Previous study suggest co-administration CCBs associate decreased platelet inhibition clopidogrel , observational study confound patient 's characteristic baseline difference proportion hypertension diabetes . The objective randomized control study compare amlodipine placebo anti-platelet effect clopidogrel .</detailed_description>
