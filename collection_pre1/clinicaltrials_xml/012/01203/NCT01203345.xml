	<brief_summary>A controlled clinical trial conduct eight participate center January 1 , 1988 , March 31 , 1991 . Patients randomly assign intravenous immune globulin group control group . There two phase study ( see ) . During phase 1 control infant receive infusion placebo . During phase 2 control infant receive infusion therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Immune Globulin ( IVIG ) Prevent Neonatal Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although survival rate very-low-birth-weight infant ( â‰¤ 1.5 kg ) continue increase , nosocomial infection remain major cause morbidity mortality . Prolonged hospitalization exposure resistant organism multiple invasive procedure , presence immunologic immaturity , render infant vulnerable hospital-acquired infection . Prior study test ability intravenous immune globulin prevent nosocomial infection premature infant vary design sample size . Despite difference rate observe infection , immune globulin preparation , dos , infusion interval , meta-analysis publish report suggest nosocomial infection may diminish prophylactic infusion IgG . The National Institute Child Health Human Development ( NICHD ) Neonatal Research Network therefore perform prospective , multicenter , randomize trial eight participate center test hypothesis intravenous administration immune globulin infant birth weight 501 1500g would reduce incidence nosocomial infection . Patients randomly assign intravenous immune globulin group control group . During phase 1 control infant receive infusion placebo . During phase 2 control infant receive infusion therapy .</detailed_description>
