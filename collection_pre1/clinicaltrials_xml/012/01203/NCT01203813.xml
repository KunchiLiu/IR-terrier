	<brief_summary>Aim 1 : To assess whether quality care stage 3 chronic kidney disease substantially improve 18 month : - Point care electronic alert primary care physician recommend risk-appropriate care , - Quarterly mailing patient provide self management support material , include tailor recommendation base personalize data electronic disease registry Aim 2 : To assess relationship utilization intervention component primary care physician attitude towards chronic kidney disease management electronic reminder system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 We develop software calculate estimate glomerular filtration rate patient present primary care physician randomize intervention arm , identify patient estimate glomerular filtration rate range 30 59 . We create three electronic alert intervention clinician receive upon access patient chart base whether patient high risk low risk . These alert focus recommend overdue laboratory test ( urine protein , blood cholesterol , etc ) , well recommend guideline appropriate medication ( ACE inhibitor ) , nephrology referral appropriate . We provide self management support material patient primary care physician randomize intervention arm . We rely primary care physician enroll patient first recommend referral via electronic alert . On monthly basis , identify patient visit alert fired referral place . We distribute list patient physician via inter-office mail least every month . The mail ask physician return list indicate patient enrolled program , project manager place referral . For non-responding physician , follow reminder email . The patient mailing include recent clinical result guideline-recommended target , encourage patient become proactive management kidney disease . Once patient enrol program , receive similar mailing update personalize data recommendation every 3 month . Electronic referral place primary care physicians management chronic kidney disease first rout renal nurse , initiate contact patient . A total two telephone call follow letter make contact patient . The nephrology visit occur per standard clinical operation , include evaluation attend nephrologist , well educational session renal nurse nutritionist . We create new template note within electronic record use nephrologists communicate clinical care recommendation back primary care physician . Prior start intervention , study team travel 14 health center conduct orientation session primary care physician . These session provide general information regard goal scope upcoming intervention , include demonstration electronic alert self management support outreach program . A similar overview also provide HVMA Division Nephrology . We randomize approximately 170 physician intervention control group . Physicians intervention group receive patient-specific alert time office visit patient Stage 3 kidney disease . Physicians control group receive active alert . Data obtain electronically automate extract electronic health record . Our study endpoint measure 18 month specify accord risk status . The primary endpoint among high risk patient 1 ) presence office visit nephrology within prior 12 month , 2 ) use ACE inhibitor ARBs hypertension microalbuminuria . The primary endpoint among low risk patient include 1 ) urine microalbumin result within prior 12 month , 2 ) use ACE inhibitor ARBs hypertension microalbuminuria . Hypertension assess base presence recent blood pressure great 130/80 mmHg current diagnosis hypertension electronic problem list . A secondary endpoint patient group achieve blood pressure le 130/80 mmHg . We also assess primary care physician awareness chronic kidney disease define use appropriate problem list encounter diagnosis cod ; rate annual serum LDL cholesterol , hemoglobin , phosphorous , 25-OH-vitamin D , calcium , parathyroid hormone testing ; well rate LDL cholesterol control ( &lt; 100 mg/ dL ) anemia management ( hemoglobin &gt; 11 g/dL ) . We conduct assessment self management support material survey patient directly assess 1 ) rating delivery self-management support physician practice , 2 ) awareness chronic kidney disease treatment goal , 3 ) utility information contain patient mailing . These survey conduct two time point : baseline ( first quarterly mail ) completion study ( final quarterly mailing ) . We conduct survey two time point facilitate analysis trend patient experience care . To assess impact intervention primary outcome fit hierarchical logistic regression model random effect patient within physician physician within center . We fit set similar model among three subgroup define number patient visit primary care physician 18 month period ( 0 visit , 1-2 visit , â‰¥ 3 visit ) . We fit two secondary model include third independent variable race sex . The effect intervention reduce race sex-based disparity assess examine race*group sex*group interaction term . Specific Aim 2 We use physician survey collect data primary care physician support electronic reminder patient self management , preparedness manage kidney disease . Physician response collect use 5 point 4 point Likert scale , examine distribution response survey item create three dichotomous predictor variable 1 ) high support electronic reminder , 2 ) high support patient self management , 3 ) high preparedness manage kidney disease . The primary outcome proportion electronic alert accompany order 1 ) recommend treatment , 2 ) referral patient self management support . We construct three separate linear regression model dichotomous predictor variable define , proportion time appropriate decision support feature use continuous outcome variable . The dichotomous physician survey outcome measure use primary independent variable . We assess statistical significance interaction term physician randomization status three dichotomous survey outcomes primary model Specific Aim 2 test whether electronic alert less effective depend physician report attitude .</detailed_description>
