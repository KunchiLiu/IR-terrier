	<brief_summary>Treatment option clinical outcome acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) improve 40 year . AML patient still suffer receive costly , ineffective chemotherapy treatment high chance bad side effect . The purpose study take look leukemia cell see investigator learn make make aggressive hard treat . We want use information create new treatment investigator hope effective less harmful AML patient . Newly diagnose , relapse refractory ( post induction therapy ) AML patient 18 year age old bone marrow blood sample take regular AML treatment . When test do treatment investigator need get extra blood bone marrow research . The patient ask extra needle stick bone marrow biopsy get sample . The patient number blood bone marrow test whether participate study . We need get two teaspoon blood two teaspoon bone marrow time patient test regular AML treatment . The research investigator sample decide change care patient get AML .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Pilot Study Bone Marrow Peripheral Blood Samples From AML Patients Characterize Biologic Heterogeneity Disease Using Single Cell Network Profiling ( SCNP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study open-label prospective investigation use fresh bone marrow pair peripheral blood sample obtain patient AML start time diagnosis include sampling time response assessment ( CR NR ) continue relapse responder subsequent treatment include salvage therapy resistance/relapse . Approximately 100 AML patient expect enrolled . There extra marrow blood sample take patient enroll study study marrow blood undergo sample routine medical need . The SCNP result use guide adjust current , future , treatment patient enrol study contact regard study result . Fresh whole bone marrow ( 5-10ml ) pair peripheral blood ( 5-10ml ) collect AML patient participate institution patient need marrow/blood test prior initiation therapy , post induction , post consolidation , relapse and/or refractory , accord standard care . When marrow obtain acceptable collect peripheral blood patient . Patient 's demographic information , diagnosis , treatment option , outcome de-identified study PI . Samples must collect standard 10 ml green top heparinized vacutainer labeled sample de-identified ID , time , date collection . Samples ship Nodality Inc. via FedEx ambient temperature ship kit day . Nodality Inc. personnel process sample study within 36 hour collection . Leukemic blast SCNP conduct supervision researcher Nodality Inc. facility own Nodality Inc . Samples fractionate bone marrow mononuclear cell ( BMMC ) peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) aliquoted . All one fractionate aliquot cryopreserved . The fresh , fractionated aliquot incubate cytokine ( e.g . interleukin , Flt3L ) , growth factor ( e.g . SCF , GM-CSF G-CSF ) , chemotherapeutic agent ( e.g . cytarabine , ara- C , etoposide ) , modulators . Cells fix , permeabilized , stained antibody recognize extracellular marker ( i.e . surface phenotypic marker cluster differentiation , drug transporter , receptor ) conjunction intracellular activation-state specific epitope ( readout ) designate signal molecule . Subsequently , cell process multiparametric flow cytometry SCNP . Blast population define use combination surface marker ( CD33 , CD34 , CD38 , CD45 , CD11b ) approximately 30 different signal node ( pair modulator/readout e.g . Flt3L â†’ phospho-Erk ) , depend sample cell number ( ideally 5-6 million ; minimum 3 million ) . Signaling readout evaluate total blast population , well within individual subpopulation , define CD33 , CD34 , CD 38 , CD45 , CD11b , Side Scatter ( SSC ) . Signaling readout analyze signal node ( univariate analysis ) well combination node data set allows multivariate analysis . In `` bridging '' assay , cell surface marker signal readout compare fresh cryopreserved AML sample include BMMC PBMC available addition BM sample .</detailed_description>
