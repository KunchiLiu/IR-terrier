	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety clinical activity idelalisib alone combination rituximab patient CLL SLL . This Phase 2 study first time idelalisib administer previously untreated patient hematologic malignancy . Idelalisib demonstrate clinical activity single agent relapse refractory CLL SLL acceptable toxicity , support evaluation previously untreated patient . The study population limit patient 65 year age young patient generally appropriate standard immunochemotherapy regimens highly active . Since mechanism action idelalisib distinct rituximab , hypothesize combination active either agent alone . This study establish initial safety clinical activity idelalisib combination rituximab patient CLL SLL . Cohort 2 study establish safety clinical activity idelalisib alone subject untreated CLL SLL .</brief_summary>
