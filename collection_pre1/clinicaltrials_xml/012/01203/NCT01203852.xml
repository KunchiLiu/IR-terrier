	<brief_summary>There many medication available treatment high blood pressure ( hypertension ) , find right one specific patient challenging . In fact , estimate less 50 % people hypertension blood pressure control . The hypothesis genetic difference individual influence response antihypertensive medication . This study aim determining genetic factor may influence person 's response either beta-blocker thiazide diuretic . The hope research , investigator may someday able use individual 's genetic information guide selection blood pressure medicine , lead good control blood pressure , less need current trial error process .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose work help move toward long-term goal selection antihypertensive drug therapy base patient 's genetic make-up . Hypertension ( HTN ) common chronic disease drug prescribe , prevalent risk factor heart attack , stroke , renal failure heart failure . Responses antihypertensive drug therapy exhibit considerable interpatient variability , contribute poor rate HTN control ( currently 40-50 % US ) , frequent nonadherence dropout therapy . We propose identify genetic predictor antihypertensive adverse metabolic response two prefer pharmacodynamically contrast drug , beta-blocker ( metoprolol ) thiazide diuretic ( chlorthalidone ) sequential monotherapy design 400 hypertensive individual . Data collect include home clinic blood pressure , blood sample test adverse metabolic effect biomarkers , RNA , DNA urine sample . We conduct genome-wide association single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) genotyping data study use replication finding previous PEAR trial , along new discovery . The primary aim define genetic determinant antihypertensive response adverse metabolic response ( e.g . change glucose , triglyceride uric acid ) . The propose research significant genetically-targeted antihypertensive therapy could lead dramatically high response rate fewer adverse effect usual trial-and-error approach . This would likely lead high rate HTN control , less need polypharmacy , reduce health care cost , improve outcome .</detailed_description>
