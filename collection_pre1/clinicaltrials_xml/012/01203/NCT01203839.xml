	<brief_summary>Currently standard care treat early stage invasive breast cancer ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) combination lumpectomy radiotherapy , know `` breast-conserving therapy '' ( BCT ) . The traditional method give radiation therapy lumpectomy whole breast . However investigator know whole breast need receive radiation well control cancer limit area breast surround tumor . The purpose study see side effect deliver partial breast irradiation ( PBI ) instead whole breast irradiation ( WBI ) . PBI radiation therapy give area breast cancer remove . Another purpose study look long term rate cancer come back breast PBI . WBI radiation therapy give 5 day week 5 7 week whole breast . Partial breast irradiation radiation therapy ( PBI ) much short whole breast irradiation . The investigator propose deliver PBI radiation therapy , minute day , day , five day week , 2 week . In study investigator learn good bad effect PBI radiation therapy . In study , investigator also learn breast look surgery radiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female Age ≥ 18 year Unicentric Stage I ( T1N0M0 ) invasive ductal breast cancer Grade 1 II DCIS measure &lt; 2 cm pathology and/or mammogram histologically confirm MSKCC Histologically negative tumor margin 2 mm ink edge tumor reexcision specimen final shave specimen ECOG Performance Status 0 1 Granulocytes ≥1,500/μl platelet count must ≥100,000/μl begin therapy patient treat adjuvant chemotherapy Women &gt; 70 year old T1 invasive ductal carcinoma estrogenreceptor positive ( ER+ ) clinically negative axillary node undergo surgical lymph node evaluation eligible patient take hormonal therapy . Patients T1N0 ( i+ ) tumor sentinel lymph node map dissection ( i.e. , tumor deposit 0.2 mm less , regardless whether deposit detect immunohistochemistry hematoxylin eosin stain ) also eligible . Clips must place lumpectomy cavity time final excision order aid delineation tumor cavity time simulation radiation delivery . Patients distant metastasis . Patients pregnant breastfeeding . Patients diffuse ( &gt; 1 quadrant &gt; 5 cm ) suspicious microcalcifications . Prior radiation therapy ipsilateral contralateral breast thorax . Histological evidence lymphovascular invasion ( LVI ) . Cases term focally suspicious LVI definitive LVI find eligible . Histologic evidence EIC , define presence intraductal carcinoma within primary infiltrate ductal tumor ( comprise least 25 % tumor area ) intraductal carcinoma present clearly beyond edge invasive tumor , predominantly intraductal tumor one area focal invasion . Patients require undergo BRCA1 BRCA2 genetic mutation test order enroll study . However , event patient test found mutation carrier , would exclude study . It would extremely rare/unlikely scenario patient discover BRCA positive completion PBI , patient risk factor BRCA mutation ( positive family history , Ashkenazi Jewish descent , ER/PR/her2neu negative receptor status ) usually test prior radiation . Should situation exist , patient receive additional RT patient replace trial . History cosmetic reconstructive breast surgery . Psychiatric illness would prevent patient give informed consent . Patients delivery PBI feasible Medical condition uncontrolled infection ( include HIV ) , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , connective tissue disease ( lupus , systemic sclerosis , collagen vascular disease ) , opinion treat physician , would make protocol unreasonably hazardous patient . Patients `` currently active '' second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer . Patients consider `` currently active '' malignancy complete therapy consider physician &lt; 5 % risk relapse within 3 year . Patients already enrol plan enroll adjuvant systemic therapy protocol noninvasive invasive breast cancer .</criteria>
