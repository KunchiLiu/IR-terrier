	<brief_title>A Randomised Controlled Trial LESS Versus Conventional Laparoscopic Appendicectomy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since original description 1970 's , laparoscopic approach management surgical disease gain widespread acceptance . It show associate decrease wound pain , analgesic requirement , hospital stay allow improve cosmesis quality life without significantly increase risk morbidity mortality . With continued improvement technology , however , effort reduce number abdomen wound attempt decrease pain , improve cosmesis outcomes underway . Natural Orifices Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery ( NOTES ) receive widespread attention medical field well general public . However , still multitude problem need solve technique broadly apply human subject [ 7 ] . On hand , renew interest single incision laparoscopic surgery emerge . The approach show safe feasible experience well others . It also potential decrease surgical trauma induce patient improve cosmesis . Since laparoscopic appendicectomy one basic procedure laparoscopic surgery , appropriate model initial evaluation single incision laparoscopic surgery . Our unit already perform 20 case single site access laparoscopic appendicectomy ( SSALA ) far , result encourage ( data pending publication ) . All patient series procedure complete single incision . None patient suffer adverse event resumption oral diet day 1 discharge day 2 post-operatively . However , whether approach beneficial compare conventional three-port laparoscopic appendicectomy still uncertain . Hence , aim current study compare approach SSALA conventional three-port laparoscopic appendicectomy reduce surgical trauma improve cosmesis patient .</detailed_description>
