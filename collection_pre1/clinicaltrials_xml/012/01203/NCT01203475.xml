	<brief_summary>This study multicenter , prospective cohort study define postnatal longitudinal growth low birth weight ( VLBW ) infant . The objective : 1 ) develop postnatal growth curve VLBW preterm infant would permit assessment growth velocity ; 2 ) relate growth velocity nutritional practice ( duration parenteral nutrition , age first enteral feeding , age full enteral feeding ) ; 3 ) compare growth velocity infants small-for-gestational age ( SGA ) infants appropriate-for-gestational age ( AGA ) ; 4 ) relate growth velocity several common , major morbidity , include chronic lung disease ( CLD ) , nosocomial infection ( late-onset infection ) necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) . These growth data may useful identify preterm infant grow slowly despite current nutritional support design perform clinical trial nutritional intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previous growth curve premature infant base 1948 study 100 infant . More recent report describe growth rate VLBW infant exceed predict previous study . The author suggest difference may reflect change nutritional management caution observed growth rate may optimal . Although great number extremely low birth weight infant include study , data infant birth weight &lt; 750 g still limit . This study multicenter , prospective cohort study define postnatal longitudinal growth low birth weight ( VLBW ) infant . The objective : 1 ) develop postnatal growth curve VLBW preterm infant would permit assessment growth velocity ; 2 ) relate growth velocity nutritional practice ( duration parenteral nutrition , age first enteral feeding , age full enteral feeding ) ; 3 ) compare growth velocity infants small-for-gestational age ( SGA ) infants appropriate-for-gestational age ( AGA ) ; 4 ) relate growth velocity several common , major morbidity , include chronic lung disease ( CLD ) , nosocomial infection ( late-onset infection ) necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) . These growth data may useful identify preterm infant grow slowly despite current nutritional support design perform clinical trial nutritional intervention . Data collect 1660 infant birth weight 501 1500 g inborn admit 24 hour age less 1 12 National Institute Child Health Human Development ( NICHD ) Neonatal Research Network center August 31 , 1994 August 9 , 1995 , survive &gt; 7 day ( 168 hour ) free major congenital anomaly . Infants weigh daily minimum 14 day birth weight regain , whichever occur later , weekly . Recumbent length measure weekly Premie Length Board . Head circumference ( HC ) measure weekly . Midarm circumference ( MAC ) measure weekly . Length , HC , MAC measurement perform twice .</detailed_description>
