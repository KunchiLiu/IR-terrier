	<brief_summary>Abdominal penetrating trauma represent frequent cause consult emergency room Venezuela . Accidents violence Hospital `` Miguel Perez Carreño '' along april 2009 represent gunshot stab wound 8th . 18th cause medical attention respectively within total 76 case . Likewise gunshot wound reach first cause morbility general surgery service 21 case stab wound 12th cause 12 case within period . Early therapy define antibiotic dose administrate within first 12 hour trauma . Abdominal cavity contamination micro-organism synonymous stablished infection , extension contamination intensity reaction enough order allow inflammatory focus develop . Abdominal cavity need least 12 - 24 hour exposure infectious material allow stablishment infection . Origin amount contaminant material influence size inoculate bacteria speed infection develop . There absolute criterion determine intrabdominal contamination progress establish infection . Surgeons decide must adequated therapy accord clinical history , radiology test finding surgery . Selected patient early antibiotic therapy penetrate abdominal trauma include traumatic intestinal wound less 12 hour evolution gastroduodenal wound lesser 24 hour well . There different antibiotic indicate intrabdominal infection . Ertapenem low resistance carbapenem broad spectrum microbial flora present penetrate abdominal trauma . Its medium life blood therapeutic level allow use unique dose within first 24 hour trauma . This research protocol design accord establish pattern clinical investigation goal achieve criterion decision make antibiotic administration patient penetrate abdominal trauma evaluate security Early short term antibiotic therapy Ertapenem 3 day vs 7 day , decrease hospital cost related indiscriminate use antibiotic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Short-term Antibiotic Therapy Penetrating Abdominal Trauma , 3 v 7 Days</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General objectives The object research evaluate impact Early short-term antibiotic therapy Ertapenem , 3 v 7 day , upon clinical postoperatory evolution patient penetrate abdominal trauma emergency room `` Miguel Perez Carreño '' Hospital Specific objectives 1 . To determine incidence postoperatory infectious complication patient penetrate abdominal trauma Early short term antibiotic therapy Ertapenem . 2 . To establish efficacy Early short term antibiotic therapy 3 day Ertapenem versus systematic administration antibiotic 7th day surgery order prevent postoperatory infection . 3 . To identify risk factor predispose appearance infectious complication patient penetrate abdominal trauma . Investigation type This prospective , comparative , double blind , randomize , experimental clinical trial patient penetrate abdominal trauma , attend emergency room Dr. `` Miguel Perez Carreño '' Hospital February July 2010 . Therapy . Surgery perform within period longer twelve hour since time trauma . Culture sample abdominal cavity take surgery order identify bacterial prevalence sensibility antibiotic . Ertapenem administrate within first 2 hour Hospital´s admission next two day surgery . At day four , patient assign different group A B , accord entrance number trial . Group A treatment continue Ertapenem 7th day . Group B antibiotic therapy stop . Patients follow do first 10 day trauma two phase : 1 . First 7 day patient control daily evaluation data record accord variable control sheet ( Appendix 3 ) . 2 . Patients evolution follow , treat medical criterion culture result : 1 . Temperature 38,5 °C high 24 hour within first 7 postoperatory day . 2 . Sustained WBC count high 14,000 increase 48 hr . Postoperatory . 3 . Postoperatory complication gastric intestinal fistula , purulent drainage , intrabdominal abscess . 3 . On day 10 new evaluation patient perform record control sheet ( Appendix 4 ) . Evaluation variable . Information record full register standard control sheet include : admittance date , medical history number , age , sex , clinical condition , associate comorbidity , surgical finding , time since trauma , surgery time , start time antibiotic administration ( Appendix 1 ) . Penetrating abdominal trauma scale apply order determine seriousness trauma potential general echo ( Appendix 2 ) . During postoperatory period control sheet include : WBC count , albumin , lymphocyte , local condition surgical wound penetration site wind abdominal wall , complication ( Appendix 3 ) . After patient discharge , appoint evaluate 10 12 day surgery follow item record : local condition surgical wound , penetration site wound , complication . ( Appendix 4 ) . Data exclude patient record exclusion cause evolution ( Appendix 5 ) . Result sample culture take surgery antibiogram report ( Appendix 6 ) . Operations plan timetable 1 . Problem identification request project design . October 2009 - Feb 2010 . 2 . Authorization request Bioethics Board `` Dr. Miguel Perez Carreño '' Hospital . Feb 2010 . 3 . Authorization request Technical Commission `` Dr. Miguel Perez Carreño '' Hospital . Feb 2010 4 . Development execution . Feb Nov - 2010 . 5 . Data analysis . November 2010 . 6 . Presentation introduction publication . Data processing analysis . To establish non-inferiority use therapy ertapenem three day versus 7 day treatment , consider significance level 5 % , 95 % confidence interval , power 80 % group control 60 % , margin le 10 % consider clinical importance . For balanced design type n1 = n2 r = 1 . Still need 26 patient per group . The period advance recruitment patient 6 month . Ethical aspect . It require informed consent individual enter study , explain , benefit possible risk , wil ask signature signatures close relative entrance time . ( Appendix 6 ) .</detailed_description>
