	<brief_summary>This study use one trialdrug : Temsirolimus ( sometimes call Torisel ® ) . Temsirolimus mTOR inhibitor . It agent specifically aim disrupt cell division ( need cancer cell growth ) . Temsirolimus show inhibit growth cancer cell . For patient metastatic kidney cancer Temsirolimus register , conventional therapy . It record patient get renal cell cancer metastases look tumor aggressive . This phase II trial . This mean investigator look effectively temsirolimus , treatment drug kidney cancer . Effective mean investigator see well treatment , investigator look long disease growing , small . The possible side effect carefully watch .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prognosis metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) patient improve last couple year , due treatment angiogenesis inhibitor mTOR inhibitor . First line second line therapy nowadays standard . However , response third fourth line therapy , RCC patient participate phase I study observe . As yet optimal sequence therapeutic agent mRCC know data progression free survival third fourth line treatment available . More patient metastatic RCC receive multiple sequential treatment . A large proportion patient remain good condition good quality life . Those candidate new line therapy . In evaluation new treatment difficulty lie way assessment activity new drug . In past , chemotherapy induce real volume response , whereas new targeted agent volume reponse may take long period time ( 6 month exceptionial ) , never induce real decrease tumor volume , patient may benefit long period stable disease . All new drug costly without side effect , therefore urgent need new end point therapy , good reflect activity drug . In first line poor prognosis metastatic RCC patient mTor inhibition temsirolimus become standard therapy base improvement PFS OS . Also temsirolimus RECIST criterion use . However , use RECIST criterion evaluation efficacy change tumour volume assess . Temsirolimus antiproliferative anti cancer drug proliferation might assess FLT PET FDG PET . Until limited data publish role FDG PET FLT PET mTor inhibitor . FLT PET seem promising mouse glioblastoma mouse treat mTor inhibitor . Another recent paper report value FDG PET suurogate marker everolimus activity , also mouse . Only one clinical study FDG PET use patient treated mTor inhibitor include patient mixture diagnose . Therefore , propose investigate systematic way whether molecular image FLT-PET and/or FDGPET well predictor response progression free survival ( PFS ) evaluation standard anatomical image CT-scan RCC patient treat temsirolimus . Furthermore , propose investigate optimal way assessment molecular characteristic tumor ( metabolism , proliferation ) compare FLT-PET FDG-PET .</detailed_description>
