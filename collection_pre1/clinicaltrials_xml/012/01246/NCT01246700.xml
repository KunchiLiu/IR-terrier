	<brief_title>Sensory Attention Focused Exercise Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , cure Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) although medication offer symptom reduction , many negative side effect associate medication use . Thus , increase emphasis exercise intervention symptom reduction . Recent research show sensory attention focus exercise ( SAFEx ) strength training intervention improve disease severity exercise intervention ( aerobic , aquatic exercise ) . Upon close examination , SAFEx show symptom improvement strength train program . Thus exist need examine SAFEx use standardize protocol - single-blind randomized double-crossover trial - use sparingly exercise intervention . In addition , 30-second chair stand implement test protocol , show reliable measurement functional strength old adult . This test implement order identify functional strength gain , , associate SAFEx . It hypothesize SAFEx intervention improve disease symptom PD , result due strength gain .</detailed_description>
