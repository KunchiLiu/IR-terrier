	<brief_summary>Research question : 1 . Will panoramic image derive cone beam CT data give well diagnostic ability conventional panoramic radiograph ? 2 . Will 3D cephalometric analysis offer orthodontists surgeon good information treatment planning ? 3 . Will 3D cephalometric analysis give accurate treatment plan well treatment outcome ? General hypothesis special aim Overall aim : - To compare 2D versus 3D cephalometric analysis : treatment plan therapeutic outcome . - To determine accuracy diagnostic ability usability 3D cephalometric analysis . - To evaluate diagnostic ability usability panoramic image derive cone beam CT data compare 2D panoramic image . - To evaluate value cone beam CT data cephalometric analyse process orthodontic maxillofacial surgery treatment . Hypotheses : 1 . The availability 3D cephalometric analysis influence orthodontic maxillofacial treatment plan decision , might change treatment outcome . 2 . Panoramic image derive cone beam CT data may provide equal information diagnosis conventional panoramic image . 3 . Cone beam CT able replace `` classic orthodontic imaging '' time dose efficient beneficial effect treatment outcome .</brief_summary>
