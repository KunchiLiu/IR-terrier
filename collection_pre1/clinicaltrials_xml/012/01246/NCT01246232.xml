	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia mental health problem usually start late teens/early twenty , often last many year . The standard medication ( 'antipsychotics ' ) problem usually helpful , take continually keep people well , reduce likelihood episode . However , one three people schizophrenia , illness show much improvement antipsychotic medication . For 'resistant ' illness , one particular antipsychotic , clozapine , work well , one disadvantage risk severe blood side effect mean regular blood test necessary . If response clozapine treatment disappointing , evidence add another antipsychotic sometimes produce improvement . However , seem add antipsychotic may need take person least 10 week order work well . The investigator plan test carefully possible benefit problem antipsychotic amisulpride dummy tablet ( 'placebo ' ) add clozapine 12 week people whose schizophrenia illness help much antipsychotic medication , take clozapine , much improvement . The investigator choose amisulpride pharmacological action may complementary clozapine , also less likely antipsychotic compound characteristic side effect clozapine , sedation , weight gain metabolic problem . Adjunctive amisulpride placebo randomly assign . The investigator expect add amisulpride likely cause improvement add placebo . But investigator learn risk side effect combine two medication . Also , investigator gain great understand possible benefit add another antipsychotic clozapine relation particular problem symptom , person 's ability live work community .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amisulpride Augmentation Clozapine-unresponsive Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 12-week , placebo-controlled RCT conduct secondary care , specifically mental health service , UK centre . The health technology assess augmentation clozapine treatment another second-generation antipsychotic , amisulpride , compare placebo : 400mg amisulpride 1 match placebo capsule first 4 week , option titrate 800mg amisulpride 2 match placebo capsule remain 8 week . The study double-blind , medication supply identical capsule contain either 400mg amisulpride placebo . The optimum dose clozapine entry subsequent augmentation achieve flexible dose regimen whereby treat psychiatrist able flexibly alter dose regimen maximise clinical risk-benefit ratio ; opportunity clinical titration clozapine dose two six week . Any direct pharmacokinetic effect clozapine level assess pre- post-augmentation plasma level clozapine , sample take baseline end 12 week . Recommended pharmacovigilance procedure follow . Clinicians ask prescribe additional medication course study , remind drug potential adverse interaction , mention SPCs clozapine amisulpride . Medication adherence assess 'pill count ' clozapine/norclozapine plasma level ratio . Therapeutic improvement assess term overall symptom severity , also use broad , clinically-relevant outcome measure social occupational function target symptom and/or behaviours well overall health status utility . Side effect systematically assess . The cost outcomes cost effectiveness acceptability net benefit analysis also measure . The primary economic measure incremental cost effectiveness ratio clozapine augmentation , estimate net cost clozapine augmentation divide net QALY clozapine augmentation . Twenty-four month allow recruitment participant , plus 3 month final follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
