	<brief_title>Otolith Function Patients With Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) genetically inherit condition . It due structural abnormality cilia , microscopic hair find organ cell throughout body . Patients condition typically develop upper respiratory tract symptom sinusitis glue ear , low respiratory tract problem recurrent chest infection , fertility problem . There currently evidence patient PCD high incidence balance problem . However , recent animal study show cilium may also important development part inner ear balance ( vestibular ) system , specifically part detects linear movement know otolith system . The investigator hope determine whether patient PCD absent reduce otolith function compare normal population . Balance problem currently screen PCD patient , could unrecognized therefore untreated . It also possible PCD patient compensate absent otolith function unaffected normal circumstance ; additional insult balance system would cause pronounced difficulty expect treatment might need reflect .</detailed_description>
