	<brief_summary>Background : - The experimental drug AT13387 show anticancer effect tumor cell block protein affect protein inside certain cancer cell , help prevent cancer cell reproduce spread . AT13387 test human , researcher interest investigate whether use treat solid tumor respond standard treatment . Objectives : - To investigate safety effectiveness AT13387 individual solid tumor . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age solid tumor respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical examination medical history , well blood test tumor image study . - AT13387 give 28-day cycle treatment . Participants receive AT13387 twice week ( 2 day row ) first 3 week cycle , follow fourth week without drug . - Participants regular blood urine sample , image study , eye examination , tumor biopsy monitor effect treatment . - Participants continue treatment AT13387 unless serious side effect develop tumor stop respond treatment ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - AT13387 synthetic Hsp90 inhibitor demonstrate improved characteristic Hsp90 inhibitor . AT13387 long tumor retention half-life prolonged inhibitory effect know oncogenic client protein . - AT13387 demonstrate activity multiple cancer cell line tumor xenografts pre-clinical model . Primary Objectives : - Define safety tolerability AT13387 administer QDx2 every week , 3 week 4 schedule , adult refractory solid tumor . - Establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) AT13387 administer QDx2 every week , 3 week 4 schedule , adult refractory solid tumor . Secondary Objectives : - Determine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) AT13387 administer QDx2 every week , 3 week 4 schedule , adult refractory solid tumor . - Assess pharmacodynamic ( PD ) marker Hsp90 inhibition modulation Hsp90 client protein AT13387 tumor tissue , serum , PBMCs . Eligibility : -Study participant must histologically confirm solid tumor malignancy progress recur least one line chemotherapy , standard treatment option exists . Participants enrol expansion phase must disease amenable biopsy willingness undergo pre- post-treatment biopsy ( Remove HER 2 archival tissue ) . Study Design : - This study follow accelerate titration design 2B initial dose level increase 100 % increment . - The accelerated phase end one patient experience dose-limiting toxicity two patient experience Grade 2 drug-related toxicity first cycle ; dose level 3 reach ; first instance Grade 2 ocular toxicity cycle . - AT13387 administer intravenously , 1 hour , 2 consecutive day , 3 4 week , every 28 day ( i.e. , day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 28-day cycle ) . - PK PD study conduct cycle 1 . Once MTD establish , 10 additional patient , enter MTD define toxicity perform PD study dose ; pre- post-treatment tumor biopsy mandatory patient . - CT scan perform baseline every 2 cycle restaging . - Up 37 patient may treat . - Study participant offer optional participation ongoing NCI image study baseline repeat scan follow last dose AT13387 cycle 1 .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically document ( confirmed Laboratory Pathology , NCI ) solid tumor malignancy metastatic unresectable , standard curative measure exist , fail least one line standard therapy . Patients must measurable evaluable disease . Patients must complete chemotherapy , radiation therapy , biologic therapy great equal 4 week prior enter study ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) . Patients must great equal 2 week since prior administration study drug exploratory IND/Phase 0 study . Patients must recover eligibility level prior toxicity adverse event . Patients receive bisphosphonates cancer eligible participate . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use AT13387 patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month . Patients must normal adequate organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/microL Platelets great equal 100,000/microL Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time institutional ULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional ULN Creatinine &lt; 1.5 time ULN ; OR Measured creatinine great equal 60 mL/minute patient clearance creatinine level great equal 1.5 time ULN The effect AT13387 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 2 month completion study . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 72 hour enrollment order eligible . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Because unknown potential risk nursing infant secondary treatment mother AT13387 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated AT13387 . During expansion phase protocol , patient must : Disease amenable biopsy Willingness undergo pre posttreatment biopsy Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Currently enrol expansion phase . Patients must : Disease amenable biopsy Willingness undergo pre posttreatment biopsy EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients know brain metastasis carcinomatous meningitis exclude clinical trial , exception patient whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable great equal 2 month treatment brain metastasis , without steroid antiseizure medication . These patient may enrol discretion principal investigator . Patients clinically significant intercurrent illness , include limited , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . QTc &gt; 450 msec men &gt; 470 msec woman . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential PK interaction AT13387 . Pregnant woman ineligible effect AT13387 develop human fetus unknown . Exclude patient active gastrointestinal bleeding event gastrointestinal bleeding within week start treatment . INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES : Both men woman , member race ethnic group , eligible trial .</criteria>
