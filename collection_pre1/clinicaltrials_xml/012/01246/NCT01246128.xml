	<brief_summary>Background : - Previous study suggest smoke cigarette affect number receptor brain nicotine , chemical present cigarette smoke . The receptor play role individual 's ability think concentrate . Many people schizophrenia similar disorder smoke , research suggest smoking may temporarily improve concentration focus individual schizophrenia . Researchers interested study current smoker nonsmoker schizophrenia determine whether smoke affect number nicotine receptor brain people schizophrenia . Objectives : - To study distribution volume nicotine receptor brain individual schizophrenia either nonsmoker current smoker . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 50 year age diagnose schizophrenia either nonsmoker current smoker ( least 10 cigarette per day past year ) . - Current smoker must able give smoke 48 hour . Design : - This study involve initial screen visit five study visit . - After screen visit , participant two session complete questionnaire thought , memory , smoke habit . Smokers also nicotine blood carbon monoxide breath level take session , smoke cigarette . - Participants session image study ( e.g. , magnetic resonance imaging ) provide baseline measurement later test , also test measure brain electrical activity . - Participants positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan session examine nicotine receptor brain . Participants need stay overnight ( nonsmoker ) 2 night ( smoker ) inpatient session . The PET scan session take 6 hour , although participant scanner 3 hour . - Participants follow-up phone call study researcher 1 week PET scanning session .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective study determine distribution volume distribution ( Vt ) vivo Beta2* acetylcholine receptor ( Beta2* nAChR ) schizophrenic smoker nonsmoker compare publish data normal healthy subject smokers nonsmoker . Study population : Participants volunteer diagnosis schizophrenia age 18 50 year . The propose sample size 10 per group : nonsmoker ex-smokers smoker total 20 participant . Design : One PET study last 8 hour combination bolus continuous infusion administration 2 [ ( 18 ) F ] FA-85380 . Smokers abstinent least 48 hr . Subjects also undergo structural MRI scan purpose registration PET scan data . Outcome Measures : Data 20 schizophrenic patient ( 10 smoker 10 nonsmoker ) compare publish data healthy control . Total volume distribution ( VT ) measure receptor density distribution Beta2 nAChR* determine Schizophrenic smoker nonsmoker difference value compare publish value difference nicotinic acetylcholine receptor density healthy smoker nonsmoker ( Mukhin et al. , 2008 ) Also , receptor distribution VT correlate level smoke symptom profile schizophrenic patient study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age : Subjects male female volunteer age 18 50 year . Contact : All subject must stable point contact must agree participate one PET study one MRI scan . Smoking group : must smoke least 10 cigarette per day least last year . They experience abstain smoking least 48 h. Nonsmoking group : Subjects nonsmoking group must nonsmoker smoke less 100 cigarette lifetime cease smoke least two year start study . Diagnosis : Each volunteer diagnosis schizophrenia use DSMIV criterion . Each subject follow information available diagnostic consideration : Structured Clinical Interview DSMIV Axis I Disorders ( SCIDI ) , general psychiatric interview past illness characteristic family history , information 23 month independent clinician observation include current detailed mental status evaluation use Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) , Schedule Assessment Positive Negative Symptoms ( SAPS/SANS ) , Schedule Deficit Syndrome ( SDS ) . An assessment impulsivity also do ( Patton , 1995 ) . Comorbidity : No subject current axis I diagnosis schizophrenia allow . No subject know claustrophobia allow . Medications : Study participant continue take antipsychotic medication take least 3 month prior study . Haldol , risperidone olanzapine allow lack significant effect density beta2* nACh receptor prolong administration rat ( Haldol ; Breese et al. , 2000 ; risperidone olanzapine ; personal communication , Mukhin , also SFN abstract ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Weight : Anyone weigh 300 lb exclude study . The purpose exclusion weight limit PET scanner . History Drug Abuse : Participants report current significant history illicit drug abuse exclude study . Subjects may use moderate amount alcohol caffeine smoke occasional marijuana cigarette , must dependent alcohol , caffeine marijuana . No alcohol marijuana least 72 hour prior scan . No smoke 48 hr PET scan . Current Medication Use : Participants continue use prescription medication . The following hypertension medication exclusionary : Indapamide , spironolactone , clonidine , guanfacine , methyldopa , propranolol . Over counter medication exclusionary , however , subject allow use counter medication week prior PET scan . CNS disease : History know structural brain abnormality ( e.g. , neoplasm , subarachnoid cyst ) , cerebrovascular disease , infectious disease ( e.g. , abscess ) , history head trauma ( define document loss consciousness 5 min great ) , history seizure adult , sleep apnea . Cardiovascular , pulmonary , systemic disease : Untreated hypertension know arrhythmia , symptomatic know coronary artery disease ; history endocarditis , cerebral embolism , obstructive pulmonary disease , asthma , active tuberculosis , know endocrine disease ( derangement adrenal , thyroid , bone reproductive function ) know chronic renal hepatic dysfunction , know HIV seropositive , know current autoimmune disease involve CNS , type I diabetes mellitus . Subjects type II diabetes mellitus allow Hb A1C less 7 . Special consideration female subject . Female participant plan become pregnant , currently pregnant nursing allow participate study potential damage fetus baby radiation . In addition , woman child bear age sexually active require use effective form birth control duration study . Effective form birth control include : 1. hormonal contraceptive ( birth control pill , injectable hormone , vaginal ring hormone ) , 2. surgical sterility ( tubal ligation hysterectomy ) 3 . IUD 4 . Diaphragm spermicide 5 . Condom spermicide Female subject give serum pregnancy test ( quantitative beta HCG ) within 24 hour PET study . Menstrual cycle phase sex show affect receptor availability ( Cosgrove et al. , 2007 ) . Radiation exposure : Any subject participate research study he/she receive radiation exposure would result combination present study , total effective radiation exposure ( research study ) exceed 5.0 rem year . Children age 18 exclude avoid unnecessary exposure radiation population . Presence body metallic implant material could move magnet MRI scanner : pacemaker , surgical implant , aneurysm clip , dental brace , bullet ( ) metallic material .</criteria>
