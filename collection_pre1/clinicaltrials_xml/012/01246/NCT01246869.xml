	<brief_summary>Purpose Study This exploratory clinical study investigate FMISO ( fluoromisonidazole ) patient ( 1 ) newly diagnose primary malignant brain tumor ( WHO [ World Health Organization ] Grade III IV glial-based tumor ) complete surgical resection contrast MRI ( Magnetic resonance imaging ) residual tumor &gt; 1.0 cm diameter receive radiotherapy ( 2 ) newly diagnose brain metastasis ( &gt; 1.0 cm diameter receive radiotherapy . The ability accurately assess tumor hypoxia accurately determine amount/degree tumor hypoxia could potentially change patient management validate tumor hypoxia know associated poor prognosis [ Eyler 2008 ] .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Malignant Brain Tumors ( Primary Metastatic ) Despite significant advance understand brain tumor biology genetics well improvement surgical technique , radiotherapy administration , chemotherapy method , many brain tumor remain incurable . Many brain tumor highly infiltrative neoplasm , therefore unlikely cure local treatment surgery , focal radiotherapy , radiosurgery brachytherapy . Rationale Goals Study The preliminary efficacy radiopharmaceutical , 1H-1- ( 3- [ 18F ] -fluoro-2-hydroxy-propyl ) -2-nitro-imidazole [ 18F ] -fluoromisonidazole , [ 18F ] FMISO , FMISO ( fluoromisonidazole ) , radiopharmaceutical directly assess tumor hypoxia use Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) assess . This preliminary/exploratory clinical study investigate [ F-18 ] FMISO 30 evaluable patient newly diagnose primary brain tumor brain metastasis . We expect 35 -40 total patient may enrol study . This assure 30 evaluable patient ( patient complete image result blood metabolism data available data analysis ) . In certain patient blood metabolism data acceptable final analysis typically due difficulty draw rapidly enough due vein collapse rapid sampling require . When possible also correlate FMISO uptake typical in-vitro test use assess proliferation , Ki-67 ( protein ) experimental assessment hypoxia . This correlation make whenever possible patient tumor tissue obtain part standard care . OBJECTIVES : Primary Objective Study - Synopsis The primary objective study determine association FMISO PET ( positron emission tomography ) uptake ( hypoxic volume [ HV ] ) , high tumor : blood ratio [ T/Bmax ] ) , FDG ( [ 18F ] -2 fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ) uptake , tumor blood flow/perfusion determine H2O ( water ) MRI correlate variable overall survival ( OS ) time progression ( TTP ) participants newly diagnose primary brain tumor brain metastasis . The Hypotheses Tested Three exploratory hypothesis study . These include : 1 . The first hypothesis test increase FMISO PET uptake ( hypoxic volume [ HV ] , high tumor : blood ratio [ T/Bmax ] ) correlate short overall survival shorter time progression . An exploratory evaluation assess combination PET image variable hypoxic volume [ HV ] , high tumor : blood ratio [ T/Bmax ] , FDG-SUV , FDG quantitative parameter blood flow well MR ( magnetic resonance ) perfusion blood volume assess see correlate survival time progression . 2 . A second hypothesis test FMISO safe non toxic dose administer study patient primary metastatic brain tumor . This assess first 10 patient enrol study . Even though numerous publish study use FMISO human several different tumor type little human safety data publish . Laboratory test ( except urinalysis ) repeat approximately 24 hour first 10 compare screening value . 3 . A third exploratory hypothesis test FMISO uptake ( hypoxic volume [ HV ] , high tumor : blood ratio [ T/Bmax ] ) correlate increase FDG uptake possibly reduce blood flow/perfusion determine H215O PET image MRI</detailed_description>
