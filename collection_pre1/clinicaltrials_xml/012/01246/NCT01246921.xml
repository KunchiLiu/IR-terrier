	<brief_summary>Rationale : Vitiligo vulgaris common acquire pigment disorder , characterise development depigmented macule . It develop probably due immunedestruction melanocyte . Most effective therapy immunsuppresive : 1. local immunesuppressives like corticosteroid calcineurin inhibitor 2. phototherapy like PUVA NB-UVB phototherapy . NB-UVB first choice A synergistic effect UVA topical corticosteroid ( fluticasone proprionate 0.05 % cream ) describe Westerhof et al . 1999 . To knowledge date publication compare NB-UVB combined topical corticosteroid NB-UVB alone . Objective : The objective study evaluate clinical effect ( onset degree repigmentation ) fluticasone proprionate 0.05 % cream ( thrice weekly ) NB-UVB phototherapy twice weekly period 12 month . Study design : Prospective single blind randomise control study . Study population : Consecutive patient â‰¥ 18 year , diagnose active vitiligo vulgaris receive NB-UVB phototherapeutic treatment Netherlands Institute Pigment Disorders Academic Medical Centre ( AMC ) , University Amsterdam . Methods : The patient randomise either NB-UVB phototherapy fluticasone proprionate 0.05 % cream NB-UVB phototherapy alone 12 consecutive month . Main study parameters/endpoints : The onset degree repigmentation assess digital image analysis target lesion blind global physician assessment . Furthermore , patient doctor satisfaction assess change immunohistochemical parameter analyse skin biopsy . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Subjects participate study ask visit institute 4 time . The time investment 20 minute per visit . Additionally , patient ask consent take punch biopsy ( 3 mm ) begin end treatment period . Hence , skin biopsy compulsory participation study . Patients may choose participate clinical non invasive part study . Known side effect NB-UVB phototherapy redness , pruritus , xerosis cutis , burn sensation conjunctivitis . These side-effects however , largely dose-dependent avoidable . Corticosteroid associate systemic side-effects ( suppression adrenocortex ) minimize treat limited body surface [ maximum 30 % body surface ] use intermittent application scheme three day week long term treatment . The region know high absorption exclude ( periorbital , axillary , inguinal genital area ) . Both topical corticosteroid NB-UVB part Dutch British guideline treatment vitiligo . There presumptive evidence indication combination therapy may result high risk side effect . All together burden due study low risk systemic local side effect low .</brief_summary>
