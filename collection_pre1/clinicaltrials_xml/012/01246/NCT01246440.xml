	<brief_title>Catumaxomab Consolidation Therapy Patients With Ovarian Cancer Second Third Clinical Disease Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epithelial ovarian cancer lethal malignant gynecological tumor fourth common cause death cancer among woman . The high incidence rate observe Eastern Northern Europe , United Status . In Spain , 3,262 new case diagnosed 2002 , figure expect rise 3,722 case 2015 ( Globocan 2002 , International Agency Research Cancer -IARC ) . The majority patient ovarian cancer diagnose advanced stage , treat maximum cytoreductive surgery follow intraperitoneal and/or intravenous chemotherapy . What consider standard chemotherapy consist platinum ( carboplatin cisplatin ) combine taxane , usually paclitaxel ( Ozols , 2003 ; Armstrong 2006 ) . Although many patient respond initial treatment , majority experience subsequent recurrence disease , need treat successive salvage therapy attempt control disease convert totally refractory ( Markman , 2004 ) . Only 20-30 % patient cure current treatment , necessary investigate develop new treatment and/or treatment strategy ( Yap , 2009 ) . Although initial treatment base cytoreductive surgery platinum-based chemotherapy large majority patient achieve complete remission disease , 90 % patient sub-optimum cytoreductive surgery 70 % optimum cytoreductive surgery develop recurrence first 24 month . One treatment strategy investigate try improve result administration consolidation maintenance treatment patient achieve complete response disease reduce risk subsequent recurrence ( Sabbatini , 2006 ) . In last year , various study establish investigate possible therapeutic effect consolidation maintenance treatment follow second third complete clinical remission , obtain salvage chemotherapy , produce several advantage strategy apply first complete clinical response : median progression-free survival second third complete response shorter predictable -10 months- , moreover recurrence practically universal ( Markman 2004 ; Harrison , 2007 ; Levine , 2007 ; Markman , 2008 ; Juretza , 2008 ) . Catumaxomab proven effective patient refractory tumour recur malignant ascites , i.e . patient advanced disease , large tumour treatment option . These clinical condition worst research immune-based therapy , hence seem logical study efficacy catumaxomab favourable condition . Patients ovarian cancer second third complete remission may suitable population investigate intraperitoneal administration catumaxomab consolidation treatment : 1 . 100 % epithelial ovarian cancer express EpCAM ( Epithelial cell adhesion molecule ) ( Kim , 2003 ; Bellone , 2009 ) . 2 . These patient present minimal residual disease eliminate standard chemotherapy responsible subsequent recurrence practically every patient , median progression-free survival 10 month ( Markman , 2004 ; Harrison , 2007 ) . 3 . The peritoneal cavity common location residual disease and/or recurrence ovarian cancer ( Ferrandina , 2006 ) . 4 . The absence macroscopic disease peritoneal cavity may bring great absorption catumaxomab blood level , hypothetical great efficacy systemic level without entail great risk toxicity ( Heiss , 2008 ; Lordick , 2008 ) . The intention phase II study estimate clinical benefit consolidation treatment catumaxomab patient epithelial ovarian cancer second third complete remission , measure progression-free survival , percentage progression-free patient 12 , 18 24 month , compare individually patient duration progression-free survival obtain follow consolidation catumaxomab observe first complete remission . If observe median progression-free survival equal great 14 month , accompany significant percentage progression-free patient 18 24 month , assess possibility subsequently design phase III study consolidation catumaxomab . To improve tolerability catumaxomab , premedication administer low-dose corticoid infusion catumaxomab . The low dos corticoid show interfere efficacy catumaxomab , reduce release certain cytokine like TNF-α ( Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha ) may reduce associated adverse effect ( Waltz , 2005 ) .</detailed_description>
