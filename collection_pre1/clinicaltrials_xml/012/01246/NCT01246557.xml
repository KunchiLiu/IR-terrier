	<brief_summary>Despite certain notable progress , treatment patient Chronic Lymphatic Leukemia ( CLL ) still disappoint . Although thanks use treatment ( immune ) chemotherapy , mainly base fludarabine , rituximab alemtuzumab , rate complete response ( CR ) increase minus 10 % observed clorambucil core therapy 60-70 % , time patient relapse die end due disease involvement related treatment . Progress understand CLL biology clear series aspect : 1 ) significant proportion CLL cell actively copy , contrary opinion CLL cell G0 phase cell cycle ; 2 ) Immune regulatory mechanism basically measure T cell NK cell important role continuous accumulation CLL cell body ; 3 ) Cells stroma essential maintain survival CLL cell series cytokine chemokines . Under light evidence , worth study new treatment mode direct CLL cell also microenvironment immune function . Lenalidomide investigate treatment several oncologic indication include myelodysplastic syndrome , multiple myeloma non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Within scope CLL , prove lenalidomide active patient relapse / treatment resistant CLL patient . Forty five patient relapse CLL , 51 % resistant fludarabine , include phase II study treat orally 25 mg lenalidomide day 1 21 cycle 28 day . The total response rate 47 % 9 % complete response . The combination lenalidomide dexamethasone investigate multiple myeloma reveal highly efficient treatment relapsing/ treatment resistant patient well newly diagnose . Bearing mind drug , lenalidomide dexamethasone , clinically active CLL investigator design study combination relapse treatment resistant patient follow treatment contain fludarabine meet requirement intensive rescue treatment . Given initial dos 10 25 mg lenalidomide daily may associate tumor lysis case , propose low initial dose lenalidomide first cycle 2.5mg. , increase prevent occurrence tumor lysis syndrome</brief_summary>
