	<brief_summary>Background : There several surgical procedure irrigation fluid use enable vision treatment body cavity , hysteroscopy , arthroscopy cystoscopy . Several solution use irrigation : normal saline , glycin , mannitol , sorbitol others . Post-operative complication , visual disturbance , confusion neurologic symptom attribute irrigation fluid absorption , water intoxication hyponatremia , refer `` TURP syndrome '' appear follow transurethral prostatectomy ( TURP ) . Historically , reduce serum sodium concentration use diagnose absorption electrolytes-free irrigating fluid urologic procedure . However , neurologic symptom follow transurethral prostatectomy ( TURP ) correlate blood sodium level , moreover , Hyponatremia may sole even primary cause neurological manifestation TURP syndrome . Other technique suggest evaluating volume irrigation solution absorption though none use routinely clinical setting . Percutaneous Lithotripsy ( PCNL ) procedure use treat patient nephrolithiasis . In procedure irrigation fluid administer kidney urinary tract collect system . The solution use normal saline . In early study evidence absorption irrigation fluid , though medical literature issue limit . However , minute change electrolytes acid-base balance may indicate opposite true . Indeed , volume irrigation duration procedure may effect well . According investigator hypothesis , change Ph reduction base content patient undergoing PCNL may result irrigation fluid absorption , since chloride normal saline know cause effect . Methods This observational prospective study consecutive 200 adult patient undergo elective surgery PCNL investigator operate room . The investigator collect data take patient 's file routine management patient : age , gender , weight , pre-operative blood test include : electrolyte , creatinine , hematocrit , ph , bicarbonate , base , length procedure , volume type irrigation fluid use , volume type intravenous fluid use . Post-operative blood test record . The investigator compare pre post-operative blood test , especially ph , bicarbonate , base content , sodium . The investigator analyse statistically correlation change parameter ( delta X ) volume irrigation fluid use surgery .</brief_summary>
