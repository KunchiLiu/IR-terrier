	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose lenalidomide give together cytarabine treat patient relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , cytarabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving lenalidomide together cytarabine may kill cancer cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Cytarabine Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) lenalidomide follow intermediate dose ARA-C ( cytarabine ) relapsed/refractory AML . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate immune reconstitution patient complete remission ( CR ) treat MTD . II . Evaluate efficacy regimen expand group treat MTD . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study lenalidomide . Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) day 6-26 cytarabine intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
