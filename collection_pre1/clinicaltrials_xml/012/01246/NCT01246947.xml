	<brief_summary>The mitral valve inflow valve main pump chamber heart . It become leaky narrow , cause blood back blood vessel lung . When patient get symptoms leaky narrow mitral valve , surgery recommend either fix replace valve . Many patient mitral valve disease also develop leaky tricuspid valve - tricuspid valve inflow valve right side heart ( right heart pump blood across lung ) . The amount leakiness tricuspid valve determine ultrasound test , amount leakiness grade : none , mild , moderate , severe . When heart surgeon operate patient diseased mitral valve , fix tricuspid valve tricuspid leakage severe . This involve sew cloth-covered ring around valve narrowing . If tricuspid valve leakage mild ( absent ) , surgeon leave tricuspid valve alone time mitral valve surgery . If tricuspid valve moderate leakage surgeon uncertain . In recent review thousand patient across nation mitral valve surgery moderately leaky tricuspid valve , 35 % patient tricuspid valve repair . Since investigator n't know best approach : leave moderately leaky tricuspid valve alone fix cloth-covered ring , investigator propose study determine approach best . Patients mitral valve surgery moderately leaky tricuspid valve randomize either 1. tricuspid valve repair 2. tricuspid valve repair . The investigator carefully follow patient two year see heart function well among get valve fix .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This single-center prospective , randomize control clinical trial . Enroll/Randomize : mitral operation alone , mitral operation tricuspid valve repair . Randomization occur operation . Operation : The surgeon perform mitral surgery patient randomize tricuspid valve repair perform tricuspid valve repair use rigid 3-dimensional annuloplasty ring use standard technique .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . All patient 1865 + old year undergo mitral valve surgery . 2 . Presence moderate mildmoderate tricuspid regurgitation read echocardiographic study perform within 6 month prior operation . Assessment tricuspid regurgitation perform use integrative method . 3 . All patient refer mitral valve surgery . 4 . Able understand consent able sign informal consent . 1 . Patients 18 year age . 2 . Patient structural/ organic tricuspid valve disease . 3 . Refusal/ Inability sign informal consent form . 4 . Pregnant woman . 5 . Tricuspid valve endocarditis . 6 . Requirement concomitant cardiac surgery ( atrial fibrillation correction surgery , closure PFO ( Patent Foramen Ovale ) ASD ( Atrial Septal Defect ) , coronary artery bypass surgery ) . 7 . Cardiogenic shock time randomization . 8 . ST segment elevation myocardial infarction require Intervention within 7 day prior randomization . 9 . Evidence cirrhosis hepatic synthetic failure .</criteria>
