	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Pre-emptive Etoricoxib Postoperative Pain Functional Outcome Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) one commonly perform orthopaedic surgery worldwide proven success treatment end-stage osteoarthritic knee . TKA associate significant postoperative pain may delay patient 's functional recovery necessitate increase use opioid analgesia , associate significant adverse effect nausea vomit . The selective cycloxygenase ( COX ) -2 inhibitor rofecoxib previously show clinical trial paper Buvanendran et al reduce postoperative opioid requirement improve clinical outcome . Feng et al study use single dose rofecoxib pre-operatively effect inflammatory marker postoperative pain . Rofecoxib , however , withdrawn market due association cardiovascular side effect . Our current clinical practice post-operative pain management constitute post-operative etoricoxib hypothesize pre-emptively administer etoricoxib pre-operatively would give even great benefit term post-operative opioid usage , pain score , functional recovery first 2-3 day . To date , study investigate etoricoxib pre-emptive medication patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty . We aim conduct study test efficacy pre-emptive etoricoxib reduce postoperative pain , opioid requirement improve rate functional recovery .</detailed_description>
