	<detailed_description>Alopecia areata ( AA ) autoimmune disease characterize nonscarring hair loss vary degree severity . It commonly involve scalp hair . It estimate occur 0.1 % 0.2 % general population unite state . Patchy hair loss common pattern see AA . There many treatment modality available AA , however , none cure disease . Given potential spontaneous recovery AA , study assess efficacy certain therapeutic modality must conduct controlled fashion . Treatment intralesional corticosteroid ( ILCSs ) consider first-line therapy adult patient less 50 % scalp involvement . Use ILCSs AA first report Kalkoff 1958 use hydrocortisone . There publish randomize controlled trial use ILCSs AA . Triamcinolone acetonide ( TA ) commonly use form ILCSs . It characterize low solubility , slowly absorb injection site , prompt maximal local action , limit diffusion spread tissue , give rise systemic side effect use therapeutic dos . Use intralesional ( IL ) TA AA first describe Orentreich et al . 1960 . IL TA usually use concentration range 2.5 10 mg/ml . Injections ( 0.1 ml per injection site ) give intradermally every 4 6 week . Abell Munro use IL TA treatment AA vary degree severity 84 patient . The concentration use 5 mg/ml injection give three time every 1 2 week . Fifteen patient receive injection isotonic normal saline control . Seventy one percent patient limit AA show evidence regrowth compare 7 % patient control group . They also notice IL TA injection fail patient rapidly progressive disease . Side effect IL TA include pain injection site , mild bleeding , transient atrophy telangiectasia , hypopigmentation , hyperpigmentation . Infection uncommon caution bony prominence recommend . Adrenal suppression rare use low dos . It report one patient receive total dose 22.5 mg one session serum cortisol level normalize 3 day . It show TA dose 20 mg result adrenal suppression . Hypersensitivity reaction TA vehicle carboxymethylcellulose extremely rare . To knowledge , prospective study compare efficacy safety different concentration IL TA treatment AA . Helfman compare therapeutic effect different concentration IL TA treatment different dermatosis . He include one patient localize AA . He inject TA use three different concentration ( 2.5 , 5 , 10 mg ) diluent placebo . Injections do 4 different quadrant within patch . He notice equivalent degree hair regrowth three site inject TA , regrowth site inject diluent . Study Objectives 1 . To compare efficacy different concentration IL TA treatment AA . 2 . To compare side effect profile different concentration IL TA use treatment AA .</detailed_description>
