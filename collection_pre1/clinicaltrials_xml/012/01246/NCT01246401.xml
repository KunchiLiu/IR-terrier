	<brief_summary>Specific Aim : To conduct randomize , placebo-controlled trial extend release-naltrexone ( XR-NTX ) among Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) infect prisoner meet Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV ( DSM-IV ) criterion opioid dependence transitioning structure correctional setting community . Hypotheses : i. XR-NTX result improve HIV clinical outcome , include low change HIV-1 RNA level , high CD4 count high rate retention care . ii . XR-NTX result improve opioid treatment outcome , include long time opioid relapse , low addiction severity lower crave opioid . iii . XR-NTX result reduce drug- sex-related HIV risk behavior compare control group . iv . XR-NTX result decrease rate reincarceration 12 month release community .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aim study conduct placebo-controlled trail ( RCT ) XR-NTX among HIV+ person jail prison meet DSM-IV criterion opioid dependence transition community . HIV treatment outcome ( HIV-1 RNA level , CD4 count , Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART ) adherence , retention care ) , substance abuse ( time relapse opioid use , % opioid negative urine , opioid crave ) , adverse side effect HIV risk behavior ( sexual drug-related risk ) outcome compare 150 recruited prisoner jail detainee Connecticut ( CT ) Massachusetts ( MA ) randomize 2:1 either XR-NTX placebo . The primary outcome interest proportion HIV-RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL 6 month . Secondary outcome include mean CD4 count , antiretroviral adherence , retention HAART HIV care , HIV risk behavior , time-to-relapse opioid use , percent opioid negative urine , retention d-NTX HIV quality life . Primary secondary outcome assess additional 6 month completion intervention . If placebo-controlled trial XR-NTX among release HIV+ criminal justice system ( CJS ) person opioid dependence demonstrate efficacy safety , likely become evidence-based intervention intervene extremely marginalized population way meet Healthy People 2010 's goal increase quality year life , decrease health disparity particularly among minority , break cycle addiction , reduce number people within CJS launch number new innovative trial second generation question future research . As , individual , health care system society high likelihood benefit . This true strategy U.S. , may even great application geographic area interface opioid disorder HIV even great .</detailed_description>
