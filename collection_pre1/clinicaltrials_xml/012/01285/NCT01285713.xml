	<brief_title>IV Glucose Dehydration Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Evaluation treatment dehydration gastroenteritis cornerstone pediatric emergency medicine , however standard regimen guideline amount type fluid administer child require intravenous hydration . Reduced carbohydrate intake gastroenteritis lead free fatty acid breakdown , excess ketone , increase likelihood continue nausea vomiting . Glucose therapy treat catabolic metabolism , improve ability overcome dehydration starvation , facilitate child 's return baseline . There previous randomize control study examine utility early intravenous dextrose treatment gastroenteritis . Objectives : To determine whether addition dextrose IV fluid treatment gastroenteritis lead decrease serum ketone . Secondarily , clinical benefit dextrose contain fluid treatment gastroenteritis assess . Methods : This double blind randomize control trial child age 2 month 12 year present Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) Emergency Department ( ED ) gastroenteritis diagnose ED attend fellow require intravenous hydration . Subjects randomize either receive intravenous fluid contain dextrose intravenous fluid without dextrose . The primary outcome measure change serum ketone intervention . Secondary outcome assessment clinical benefit dextrose contain fluid term persistence emesis , satisfaction treatment ( physician parental survey ) , admission rate , revisits within 1 week emergency department primary care physician , length illness parental assessment time return baseline . Implications : Despite current standard use normal saline intravenous rehydration , high admission rate lengthy stay emergency department child gastroenteritis . There room improvement treatment common emergency department entity . It hypothesize glucose load subsequent increase endogenous insulin production reduce free fatty acid breakdown facilitate faster resolution ketosis , thus quick return baseline . By measure serum ketone intravenous fluid administration either glucose standard normal saline , directly measure effect . Inclusion Criteria 1 . Males females age 2 month 12th birth date 2 . Gastroenteritis ( diagnose ED attend fellow physician ) 3 . Need IV fluid 4 . Dextrose stick great 60 less 170 5 . Parental/guardian English speaking grant informed consent Exclusion Criteria 1 . Underlying chronic disease affect glucose metabolism reason/persistence symptom : Renal failure , Diabetes Mellitus , Diabetes Insipidus , Metabolic Disorder , ventriculoperitoneal ( VP ) shunt , Migraine Headaches 2 . Shock 3 . Vomiting great 72 hour since onset illness 4 . Patients receive IV fluid outside institution within 12 hour Investigational Plan : All enrol subject 1.5 microliters blood collect onto test strip IV placement perform clinical care , serum ketone measure use bedside ketone meter . The ketone meter validate comparison standard laboratory beta-hydroxybutyrate level ( r=.92 , p &lt; 0.0001 ) . All patient dehydration score record ( Table 1 ) . Subjects randomize either glucose contain IVF group non-glucose contain IVF group . All fluid prepare pharmacy blind treat team patient . Those glucose contain IVF group receive 10 cubic centimeter ( cc ) per kilogram ( kg ) ( cc/kg ) 5 % Dextrose ( D5 ) normal saline ( NS ) ( D5NS ) 30 cc/kg bolus normal saline . Those randomized non-glucose contain IVF group receive 10 cc/kg normal saline rest normal saline bolus ( 30cc/kg ) . Both study arm fluid intervention initially receive repeated goal total 40cc/kg complete within 60 minute . D5NS chosen decrease exposure free water suppress lipolysis . After intervention complete , serum ketone measure bedside meter recorded subject . The treat team blind ketone measurement . A dextrose stick obtain final ketone measurement , value &gt; 200 , treat team notify ensure proper safety . Subjects allow oral intake 60 minute study period order allow determination effect intervention . A repeat dehydration score obtain time disposition .</detailed_description>
