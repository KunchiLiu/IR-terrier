	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Chemoembolization kill tumor cell block blood flow tumor keep chemotherapy drug near tumor . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well chemoembolization use irinotecan work treat patient liver metastasis metastatic colon rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemoembolization Using Irinotecan Treating Patients With Liver Metastases From Metastatic Colon Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define response rate colorectal liver metastasis ( treated lobe ) treat DEBIRI , refractory mCRC patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate time progression treat lobe patient population . II . To evaluate overall survival patient population . III . To evaluate patient tolerance toxicity profile treatment DEBIRI patient population . OUTLINE : Patients receive irinotecan-eluting bead via hepatic artery embolization every 3 week 3 ( unilobar disease ) 4 ( bi-lobar disease ) course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
