	<detailed_description>An altered microbial exposure may partly responsible increase allergic diseases population western lifestyle . Activation immune system microbes early life probably required accurate maturation immune system . Probiotics , live bacteria consider confer health ingest , suggest prevent eczema sensitisation infant . The aim study assess effect oral supplementation probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri ( L. reuteri ) infancy development allergic disease sensitisation first 2 year life examine mechanism possibly underlie eventual effect allergic manifestation . In study development allergic disease also relate prospectively immunological , nutritional environmental factor . The study prospective double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial , comprise 232 family allergic disease . The family recruit antenatal clinic , mother receive L. reuteri ATCC 55730 ( 1 x 100 000 000 colony form unit , Biogaia AB , Stockholm , Sweden ) placebo daily gestational week 36 delivery . Their baby continue study product birth 12 month age follow another year . Clinical follow-up do 1 , 3 , 6,12 24 month age telephone interview 2,4,5 , 8 , 10 18 month . A questionnaire complete occasion . Skin prick test perform 6 , 12 24 month age . Venous blood collect umbilical cord 6 , 12 24 month store heparinized plasma serum assessment . Peripheral mononuclear blood cell ( PBMC ) separate plasma sample storage . Blood sample also collect mother father study . The stool sample collect mother 1 week delivery infant 5-7 day , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month 24 month age . Saliva sample collect 3 , 6 , 12 24 month age breast milk sample collect mother 1-3 day 1 month delivery . The saliva , breast milk plasma/serum sample store -20°C stool sample PBMC -70°C assessment . A follow perform 7 year age focus allergic disease . Spirometry , skin prick test perform . Of 188 complete 2 year follow , 184 also complete 7 year follow .</detailed_description>
