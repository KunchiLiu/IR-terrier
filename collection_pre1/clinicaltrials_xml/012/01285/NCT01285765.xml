	<brief_summary>Localized stage DLBCL low IPI ( aaIPI = 0 ) good prognostic standard immuno-chemotherapy 6 cycle R-CHOP 21 . Five year PFS estimate 75 % , whatever age patient . PET scan actually consider `` gold standard '' initial stag evaluation response treatment . With new technique , response criterion redefine Cheson al . 2007 . Moreover , several recent study show early evaluation response PET scan 2 cycle chemotherapy accurate define two group patient : `` Early-good-responders '' , PET scan negative `` Early-poor-responders '' , PET scan remain positive Prognostic first group good , second poorer . At present time , interest modification and/or intensification treatment early-poor-responder patient demonstrate publication . New study ongoing patient advanced stage DLBC NHL ( GELA trial LNH 07-3B ) Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( GELA EORTC trial H10 ) ; aim evaluate new strategy treatment adapt early response criterion . No trial already make low IPI DLBCL . In study , investigator purpose evaluate adaptation treatment early response base PET scan result 2 cycle chemotherapy , patient age 18 80 year , low IPI DLBCL . This open randomize study . The primary endpoint evaluate 3 year PFS aim demonstrate non inferiority experimental arm comparison standard arm : In standard arm , patient receive 6 cycle R-CHOP 21 without take account PET scan result 2 cycle . In experimental arm , early good responder patient ( define negative PET scan 2 cycle , confirm 4 cycle ) receive 4 cycle R-CHOP 21 . In arm , PET scan remain positive 4 cycle chemotherapy , biopsy exam need confirm failure intensive chemotherapy recommend . All patient , arm , early evaluation PET scan . All PET scan review group expert accord Deauville criterion define Meignan et al adapt decision 2nd cycle experimental arm 4th cycle patient . The final evaluation response make accord 2007 Cheson 's criterion .</brief_summary>
