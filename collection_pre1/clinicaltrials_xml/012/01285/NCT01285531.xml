	<detailed_description>Objective : To evaluate pediatric emergency department ( ED ) provider lumbar puncture success without Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced , new pressure transducer , order determine : proportion lumbar puncture ( LPs ) ) cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) obtain first attempt , b ) CSF obtain attempt , c ) sufficient CSF obtain standard test ( culture , chemistry , cell count ) ; time provider success obtain ) drop fluid needle , b ) opening pressure measurement ; proportion successful lumbar puncture contain blood ; provider satisfaction . Background : Lumbar puncture necessary diagnose meningitis , neurological disease cancer . They common pediatric emergency department procedure frequently require repeat attempt partially successful , sufficient blood limit interpretation . Measuring cerebrospinal fluid pressure lumbar puncture recommend rarely do , due limitation current technology . Liquid column manometry cumbersome , time-consuming frequently impractical . Existing pressure transduction probe connect via tube external monitor design recommend LPs . The pressure display monitor difficult view lumbar puncture procedure equilibrate slowly keep pace pressure change lumbar puncture . The Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced new , inexpensive , disposable , medical device , specifically design use lumbar puncture , potential increase lumbar puncture success decrease blood contamination . It attach spinal needle display numeric pressure value pressure waveform , allow physician readily identify cerebrospinal fluid space measure cerebrospinal fluid pressure . The device small , easy use , readily incorporate standard practice . Methods : This randomized clinical trial test add Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced vs. standard care 60 child 0-16 year old receive lumbar puncture Seattle Children 's Hospital Emergency Department . We test Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced standard care 60 child receive lumbar puncture , compare success , pressure obtain , time success , complication ( e.g . &gt; 200 red blood cells/mm3 ) provider satisfaction . Results compare chi-squared test , regression , Kaplan-Meier logrank test . We expect improved success , decreased time success complication high provider satisfaction . Impact : Currently , one third lumbar puncture require multiple attempt , 7-20 % contain blood limit interpretation , 6 % unsuccessful . This result unnecessary hospitalization , increase hospital day , increase antibiotic use increase number repeat procedure . The Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced uniquely provide immediate feedback pressure allow physician quickly confidently identify cerebrospinal fluid space , instantly determine cerebrospinal fluid pressure space reach . We believe Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced increase lumbar puncture success decrease proportion contain blood . It potential become standard care use every lumbar puncture procedure . This study expect demonstrate clinical utility Compass Lumbar Puncture Enhanced medical community .</detailed_description>
