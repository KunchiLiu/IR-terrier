	<brief_summary>Part A- The purpose study determine safe dose LY2801653 give participant advance cancer determine side effect may associate LY2801653 participant population . Efficacy measure use ass activity LY2801653 . Part B- The dose determine Part A use along efficacy measure assess activity LY2801653 participant adenocarcinoma colon rectum , head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) , uveal melanoma liver metastasis , cholangiocarcinoma . Part C - objective Part C determine recommend Phase 2 dose LY2801653 may safely give participant HNSCC take standard dos cetuximab Part D - objective Part D determine recommend Phase 2 dose LY2801653 may safely give participant cholangiocarcinoma take standard dose cisplatin . Part E - objective Part E determine recommend Phase 2 dose LY2801653 may safely give participant cholangiocarcinoma take gemcitabine plus cisplatin . Part F - objective Part F determine recommend Phase 2 dose LY2801653 may safely give participant gastric cancer take ramucirumab .</brief_summary>
