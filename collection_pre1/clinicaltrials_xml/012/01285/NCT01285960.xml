	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety ablation efficacy ExAblate UF V2 System treat symptomatic uterine fibroid . The ExAblate System medical device involves focus ultrasound system MRI scanner . ExAblate delivers pulse focus ultrasound energy , sonication , target tissue . In particular study , target tissue uterine fibroid . Each sonication use heat small spot fibroid much like magnify glass use focus light heat spot . The heat create kill portion fibroid goal decrease eliminate uterine fibroid-related symptom . Repeated sonications perform entire fibroid treat treated volume determine appropriate . The ExAblate system commercially approve United States treat symptomatic uterine fibroid . The ExAblate UF V2 System experimental device investigate study . While similar commercial system , ExAblate UF V2 device include follow major change , among others , intend improve device performance safety : - Up movement ultrasound transducer , attempt improve fibroid treatment move ultrasound focal point within target fibroid . - Ultrasound energy turn specific area attempt minimize amount energy pass sensitive area body .</brief_summary>
