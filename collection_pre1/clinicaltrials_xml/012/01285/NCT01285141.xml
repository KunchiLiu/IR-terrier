	<brief_summary>A vaccine prevent infection Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) urgently need . Worldwide , HIV infection occur sex man woman . The vaccine study consist protein HIV synthetically produce link protein boost immune response . It test human , expect ( animal study ) direct application female genital tract ( via vagina ) liquid drop , provoke immune protection site HIV infection . This less applicable men , therefore healthy , HIV negative woman recruit . The investigator recruit one site , university vaccine research centre experience run similar trial . The study last 24 week subject blood sample take six visit , three immunisation 12 week 1 millilitre vaccine place vaginal insert small plastic syringe . The purpose initial small study monitor safety vaccine determine whether appropriate continue future , large study immune response vaccine measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This hypothesis-generating , first-in-human , Phase 1 study conduct accord Standard Operating Procedures ( SOPs ) St George 's . The purpose study determine immediate safety reactogenicity vaccine , guide future large Phase 1/2 study safety efficacy . Eight subject include receive 3 cervico-vaginal topical application 100µg CN54gp140-hsp70 conjugate vaccine 1.0 mL physiological buffer , administer topical intra-vaginal drop day 0 , 4 12 week first immunisation . The study consist 1 pre-study screen visit , 3 immunisation visit , 2 follow-up visit total period 20 week . Subjects recruit one cohort two group four . The dose antigen immunisation schedule select base pre-clinical clinical experience HIV envelope protein . Each subject 's medical history ( include past present illness , current medication , family medical history ) formally assess record screening . Volunteers ' age , gender , height , weight ethnic origin record . A full physical examination conduct register medical practitioner screen final study visit . Regular assessment vital sign ( pulse , blood pressure , temperature ) make visit . Diary card , investigator-prompted recall event , laboratory test ( haematology , biochemistry ) direct visualisation immunisation site use identify Adverse Events . Frequency vaccine-related Adverse Events Primary Study Endpoint . Before immunisation visit ( 0 , 4 12 week ) blood sample obtain collection serum separation PBMCs cellular assay . At time point , vaginal cervical secretion take . All immunology assay exploratory study endpoint . HIV serology DNA detection repeat final visit detect subject may contract HIV infection study period , may therefore develop antibody T-cell response due HIV infection would interfere exploratory immunology assay .</detailed_description>
