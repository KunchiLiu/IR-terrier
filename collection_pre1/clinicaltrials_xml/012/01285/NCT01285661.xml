	<brief_summary>Prospective cohort study aim optimize duration anticoagulant treatment patient first episode proximal deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) low extremity , whose pathogenesis either unknown ( idiopathic DVT ) associate minimal risk factor thrombosis , help algorithm incorporate ultrasonography D-dimer information . All patient followed-up 1 ) achievement major end-point ; 2 ) date lose followup ; 3 ) date death ; 4 ) date study stop . The purpose study demonstrate safety withhold anticoagulation subgroup patient proximal DVT whose vein recanalized present repeatedly negative D-dimer ( baseline , 1 3 month ) . The approach deem safe annual rate recurrent VTE patient anticoagulation discontinue low 5 % .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After give informed consent , patient receive ultrasound investigation proximal-vein system ( common femoral vein groin , popliteal vein trifurcation ) : - Patients residual thrombosis ( defined diameter least 4 mm least one spot ) anticoagulation continue . A repeat ultrasound schedule 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 36 month . In patient persistently residual thrombosis anticoagulation discontinue , whose vein recanalized decision make process base behaviour D-dimer ( see ) . - Patients whose vein recanalized ( either recruitment later ) receive D-dimer determination discontinue anticoagulation . In negative D-dimer anticoagulation discontinue . These patient two determination D-dimer ( 1 3 month , respectively ) . While patient persistently negative D-dimer longer receive anticoagulation , D-dimer become positive anticoagulation resume long discontinue . - All patient follow completion 4 year since recruitment . For purpose study quantitative D-dimer allowed . The criterion D-dimer interpretation rely cut-off recommend manufacturer diagnostic purpose . D-dimer.For purpose study quantitative D-dimer allowed . The criterion D-dimer interpretation rely cut-off recommend manufacturer diagnostic purpose . Sample size 1000 year observation without anticoagulation require demonstrate ( power 90 % , type I error 0.05 , two side ) approach annual rate recurrent VTE low 5 % . Approximately 600 patient proximal DVT satisfy eligibility criterion require obtain 1000 year observation without anticoagulation .</detailed_description>
