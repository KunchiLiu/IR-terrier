	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomize , control , single-center study ass effectiveness Vitagel , surgical hemostat , primary unilateral total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) . This inter-patient control study involve one-hundred-ten subject . Vitagel use randomly select cohort fifty-five patient undergo primary unilateral THA procedure ; control group fifty-five patient receive Vitagel hemostatic agent except standard primary THA . The study evaluate effectiveness Vitagel reduce intra- post-operative bleeding .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Evaluate Effectiveness Haemostatic Agent Primary Unilateral Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitagel Surgical Hemostat compose microfibrillar collagen thrombin combination autologous plasma . It apply surgical site sprayable liquid form collagen/fibrin gel matrix ( contain patient activated platelet ) adhere bleed site . This matrix provide hemostasis facilitates heal . Vitagel resorb approximately 30 day . It easily prepare OR staff minute require ~10mL 's patient 's blood per Vitagel 4.5ml kit . Compared hemostatic agent market today , Vitagel advantage contain pool human donor blood protein , aprotinin , tranexamic acid . Vitagel study multiple surgical specialty demonstrate safety efficacy . Vitagel study orthopedic procedure , iliac crest donor sit sternal edge , IDE study FDA approval . Vitagel grant broad indication use FDA 2000 adjunct hemostasis . It formerly market name CoStasisÂ® Surgical Hemostat , Cohesion Technologies , Palo Alto , CA . The use surgical hemostat joint arthroplasty may substantially decrease post-operative blood loss , may reduce patient morbidity , length hospital stay , cost potentially eliminate need transfusion drain . Total Hip Arthroplasty ( THA ) associate post-operative blood loss frequently require transfusion blood product . Increased concern risk blood transfusion , include transmission viral disease , HIV , Hepatitis , CMV well transfusion reaction , perpetuate search new method blood conservation orthopedic surgery . There exist considerable variation protocol use optimize hemostasis minimize post-operative blood loss patient undergoing THA . Some method use include pre-operative hemodilution hypotensive anesthesia ; however , method associate risk , require careful monitoring , prolong operative time . Another method use intra-operative post-operative salvage blood re-infusion require continuous monitoring limited patient bleed heavily initial period follow surgery , blood collect period six hour . The transfusion autologous pre-donated blood also commonly use THA surgery . While autologous pre-donated blood associate risk viral disease transmission , rate administrative error bacterial overgrowth ( factor frequently associate immediate post-transfusion death ) comparable associate use homologous blood . The collection pre-donated blood require special program schedule . Studies indicate use autologous blood transfusion may little health benefit considerable cost . During surgery , meticulous electrocautery , help minimize acute blood loss post-operative drainage . No uniform guideline exist regard use post-operative drain THA . Some surgeon use drain system allow re-infusion erythrocyte , others prefer simple vacuum drain . Still others use drain . There conflict data regard efficacy close suction drain . Some study show bleeding may potentiate suction drainage . Other study show drain lead complication infection , increase blood loss , need blood transfusion , breakage drain tube , pain drain tube removal . Thus , need adequate hemostasis THA remain apparent . To date limit publish study use hemostatic agent THA procedure . However , even relatively low number patient study show use hemostatic agent safe effective mean reduce blood loss need rate blood transfusion .</detailed_description>
