	<brief_title>Safety Study Transmyocardial Revascularization ( TMR ) With Bone Marrow Aspirate ( BMAC ) Angina Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently publish information suggest delivery concentrate autologous bone marrow , combination transmyocardial revascularization ( TMR ) may provide synergistic effect reduction angina patient treatable conventional coronary artery bypass percutaneous coronary intervention . This safety feasibility study intend confirm work previously do one hospital large , multicenter set . Patients candidate TMR ask participate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patient , 18 year age old , male female . Left ventricular ejection fraction great equal 40 % ( document within 6 month TMR procedure . Patient medically refractory , stable , Class IV angina accord Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina scale . Optimal medical therapy define maximum tolerable stable dos betablockers , statin , antiplatelets long act nitrate without control symptom least 30 day . Patient least 15 cm² ( 15 % surface area distal 2/3 leave ventricle free wall allow minimum 15 TMR channel ) document region myocardium distal twothirds leave ventricle reversible ischemia . Patients enrol base image use determine eligibility TMR within previous 6 month . However , patient baseline followup MRIs take per standardize protocol adjudicate core lab . Has document leave ventricular wall thickness ≥8 mm . Patient candidate treatment direct coronary revascularization method ( i.e. , CABG PCI ) document independent interventional cardiologist independent cardiothoracic surgeon Angiographic Screening Form . Patient able perform baseline exercise tolerance test ( ETT ) . Patient , female , childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy test within 7 day procedure . Patient bone marrow aspirate total nucleated count least 15 x 106/mL time harvest . Patient provide informed consent . Can undergo surgical procedure , thoracotomy general anesthesia . Has mechanical prosthetic heart valve . Has history bone marrow disease ( especially NonHodgkin 's Lymphoma Myelodysplastic Syndrome ) prohibit autologous bone marrow derive cell transplantation . Has severe , new onset increase angina . In addition , patient wean intravenous antianginal medication least 48 hour preoperatively exclude . Severe , new onset increase angina define : Severe angina angina occur rest usually prolong &gt; 20 minute occur within week presentation ; new onset angina angina least Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification ( CCSC ) III severity onset within 2 month initial presentation ; increase angina previously diagnose angina distinctly frequent , long duration , low threshold , ( i.e. , increase least one CCSC class within 2 month initial presentation least CCSC III severity . Has STEMI ( ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction ) NSTEMI ( NonSTEMI ) within 4 week TMR procedure . Has decompensated heart failure , diagnosis NYHA Functional Class III/IV heart failure . Has hemorrhagic propensity address drug management . Has severe lifethreatening arrhythmia ( e.g. , ventricular tachycardia fibrillation ) within one week prior TMR procedure . Is unable undergo cardiac MRI procedure . Has uncontrolled diabetes HbA1C &gt; 10 % . Has anemia define hematocrit &lt; 33 % woman &lt; 39 % men . Has moderate severe renal dysfunction define serum creatinine &gt; 1.8 mg/dL . Has moderate severe liver dysfunction define &gt; ALT/AST &gt; 5X upper limit normal . Is unable unwilling return followup . Is participate another clinical investigation within prior 30 day .</criteria>
