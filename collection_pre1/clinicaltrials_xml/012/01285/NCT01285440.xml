	<brief_summary>The purpose study show improvement molecular breast imaging ( MBI ) technology allow reduction administer dose Tc-99m sestamibi maintain sensitivity 90 % tumor detection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Low-dose Molecular Breast Imaging Detection Small Breast Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 150 patient study . Each patient suspicious lesion mammogram , ultrasound breast magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) biopsy schedule . The lesion size mammogram , ultrasound breast MRI must less 2 cm diameter must consider `` suspicious '' `` highly suspicious '' malignancy . Following injection 8 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi , patient undergo craniocaudal ( CC ) mediolateral oblique ( MLO ) view breast use molecular breast imaging ( MBI ) system incorporate late hardware software algorithm . Each image acquire 10 minute dynamic mode 4 x 2.5 minute image . Summation give number frame acquisition yield image increase mCi dose . Hence 8 mCi injection dynamic acquisition mode , evaluate sensitivity MBI function administer dos Tc-99m sestamibi range 2 8 mCi . The thickness breast record determine relevance lesion detectability . Patient Selection The goal study enroll 150 female patient study . The rationale study number 150 patient give Appendix D. Patients refer mammogram , ultrasound breast MRI study Mayo Clinic Rochester consider study meet follow criterion : - Have lesion mammogram , ultrasound breast MRI measure &lt; 2 cm consider suspicious highly suggestive malignancy accord Breast Imaging Reporting Data System Atlas criterion ( BI-RADS 4 5 ) . ( Note : 2 cm large desire lesion size wish study , limit recommend radiology colleague estimate lesion size mammography , ultrasound MRI exact ) - Are schedule biopsy ( needle and/or surgical biopsy ) suspicious lesion - Are &gt; 18 year age - Had negative pregnancy test must postmenopausal surgically sterilize Eligible patient offer enrollment time interval mammogram , ultrasound MRI schedule biopsy allows performance MBI . Patients prior needle biopsy lesion exclude study , biopsy may effectively remove part lesion . Prospective patient identify radiologist base finding mammographic , ultrasound MRI study .</detailed_description>
