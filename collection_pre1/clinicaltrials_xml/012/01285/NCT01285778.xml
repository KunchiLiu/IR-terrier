	<brief_summary>Chemoradiation 5-FU Mitomycin C standard treatment anal canal SCC . Panitumumab show efficacy tumor anti-EGFR treatment show clinical activity single report refractory anal canal SCC patient . Based background , propose conduct phase II study investigate efficacy toxicity radiotherapy association : - 5-FU 1000mg/m2 day 1-4 29-32 - Mitomycin C 10mg/m2 day 1 29 - Panitumumab 6 mg/m2 day 1 , every 2 week 8 week</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In 1980s , treatment choice anal cancer abdominal-perineal amputation , include removal anus , rectum lymphatic drainage area permanent colostomy . With treatment , 5-year survival rate 40-70 % . In follow year , however , show anal cancer tumor sensitive chemotherapy radiation , surgery first choice reserve resistant case relapse . Concomitant chemo radiotherapy base Mitomycin C - 5-FU regimen currently standard treatment localize ( except T1N0 ) locally advanced case . This statement support two randomized study show administration chemoradiation Mitomycin C - 5FU good radiation monotherapy . The trial conduct United Kingdom Coordinating Committee Cancer Research ( UKCCCR ) randomize 585 patient receive radiotherapy ( 45 Gy 4-5 week ) radiotherapy regimen couple 5-FU ( 1000 mg/m2 x 4 day 750 mg/m2 x 5 day ) , first last week radiotherapy Mitomycin C 12 mg/m2 day 1 . The 3-year local failure rate 39 % combine arm versus 61 % radiotherapy alone . There differences 3-year overall survival rate . On hand , study conduct EORTC , 110 patient distributed receive radiotherapy ( 45 Gy 5 week , overimpression 15 Gy patient CR 20 Gy PR ) radiotherapy plus 5-FU ( 750 mg/m2 day 1-5 29-33 ) associate Mitomycin C ( 15 mg/m2 day 1 ) . The CR rate significantly great group treat chemoradiation ( 80 % vs. 54 % ) . After 5 year follow-up , still 18 % increase local control rate favor group treat chemoradiation . More recently , result phase II CALGB trial , suggest administration induction treatment two cycle cisplatin-5FU ( cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day 1 29 5FU 1000 mg/m2 day 1-4 29-32 ) follow chemoradiotherapy 5-FU Mitomycin C promising , especially patient poor prognosis , 50 % patient remain colostomy disease-free 48 month . However , randomize study RTOG group , include 682 patient , strategy compare classic concomitant chemoradiation 5-FU ( 1000 mg/m2 day 1-4 29-32 ) Mitomycin C ( 10 mg/m2 day 1 29 ) . No difference survival find , also detect colostomy rate great patient treat regimen contain Cisplatin ( HR , 1.68 ; 95 % CI , 1.07-2.65 ; P=.02 ) . The author conclude induction cisplatin superior traditional administration 5FU-Mitomycin C RT . Epidermoid anal cancer tumor often express EGFR receptor . In initial study 21 case , report EGFR expression biopsy . In another study 38 case , find 55 % tumor express EGFR . No study publish , however , investigate efficacy Panitumumab tumor . There one report refractory case cetuximab administer together CPT-11 excellent response .</detailed_description>
