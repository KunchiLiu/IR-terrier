	<brief_summary>Justification aim study : The principal aim use opiate substitute methadone high-dose buprenorphine ( HDB ) reduce need desire consume opiate patient addict . Adjustment initial dose regular re-evaluation efficacy treatment key element success management . While high dose responsible side effect lead abandonment treatment , low dose induce reappearance even reinforce parallel consumption psychoactive substance , particular cocaine , alcohol cannabis . The principal aim project determine course parallel consumption patient receive maintenance dose methadone HDB least two month , analysis sample hair , biological matrix innovative type study . Hair test establishes retrospective profile consumption . The secondary aim project ( ) validate French version Handelsman 's subjective objective opiate withdrawal scale seek possible correlation high score scale presence parallel consumption , ( ii ) seek association polyconsumption common functional polymorphism metabolic enzymes methadone HDB . Expected result : Hair test , particular advantage long detection window sample need take interval , could improve biological monitoring patient substitutive treatment . Validation French version Handelsman 's scale objective subjective sign opiate withdrawal search correlation parallel consumption enable scale use daily practice clinical surveillance patient substitutive treatment . If polymorphism metabolic enzyme one molecule detect , rapid genotyping simple saliva sample valuable guiding choice medication decide treatment strategy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hair Testing Assess Consumption Illicit Psychotropic Agents Alcohol Patients Treated With High-dose Buprenorphine Methadone . Search Pharmacogenetic Contribution Low Efficacy Substitution Medications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodology : The two population patient , one treat methadone , HDB , recruit accordance ethical principle declaration Helsinki , consultation center addiction treatment . One hundred ten patient include two population . Written inform consent obtain patient . Anonymity respect inclusion throughout . Using sample hair , test measurement principal drug ( opiate , cannabis , cocaine , amphetamine ) specific marker ethanol consumption , ethyl glucuronide , perform chromatographic technique ( high-performance liquid chromatography gas phase chromatography ) together detection mass tandem mass spectrometry . This non-invasive sampling informative blood test , give retrospective profile individual 's consumption several month . Treatment efficacy also assess use Handelsman 's subjective objective opiate withdrawal scale . Lastly , polymorphism metabolic enzymes methadone HDB seek real-time PCR saliva sample , method give similar result without need venous blood sampling .</detailed_description>
