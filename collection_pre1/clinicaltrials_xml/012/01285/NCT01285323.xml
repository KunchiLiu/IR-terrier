	<criteria>The patient male female , 12 75 year age , previous diagnosis asthma . Patients 12 17 year age exclude participate Germany , India , Argentina , Korea ; patient 66 75 year age exclude participate India Korea . The patient least 1 asthma exacerbation require oral , intramuscular ( im ) , intravenous ( iv ) corticosteroid use least 3 day past 12 month screen . The patient current blood eosinophil level least 400/μL . The patient airway reversibility least 12 % betaagonist administration . The patient ACQ score least 1.5 5 screening baseline ( 1st dose study drug ) visit . The patient take inhaled fluticasone dosage least 440 μg , equivalent , daily . Chronic oral corticosteroid use ( 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) allow . If patient stable dose , eg , 2 week oral corticosteroid treatment time study enrollment , patient must remain dose throughout study . The patient 's baseline asthma therapy regimen ( include , limited , inhaled corticosteroid , oral corticosteroid maximum dose 10 mg prednisone daily equivalent , leukotriene antagonist , 5lipoxygenase inhibitor , cromolyn ) must stable 30 day prior screen baseline must continue without dosage change throughout study . All female patient must surgically sterile , 2 year postmenopausal , must negative pregnancy test ( ßhuman chorionic gonadotropin [ ßHCG ] ) screening ( serum ) baseline ( urine ) . Female patient childbearing potential ( surgically sterile 2 year postmenopausal ) , must use medically accept method contraception must agree continue use method duration study 30 day participation study . Acceptable method contraception include barrier method spermicide , abstinence , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , steroidal contraceptive ( oral , transdermal , implanted , inject ) . NOTE : Partner sterility alone acceptable inclusion study . Written inform consent obtain . Patients 12 17 year old , participate , must provide assent . The patient reasonable health ( except diagnosis asthma ) judge investigator , determine medical history , medical examination , ECG evaluation ( screen ) , serum chemistry , hematology , urinalysis . The patient must willing able understand comply study restriction , requirement , procedure , specify study center , remain study center require duration study period , willing return study center followup evaluation specify protocol . Patients experience asthma exacerbation screen period consider fail screen randomly assign study drug . Patients may rescreened 1 time . The patient clinically meaningful comorbidity would interfere study schedule procedure , compromise patient 's safety . The patient know hypereosinophilic syndrome . The patient another confound underlying lung disorder ( eg , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pulmonary fibrosis , lung cancer ) . Patients pulmonary condition symptoms asthma blood eosinophilia ( eg , ChurgStrauss syndrome , allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis ) also exclude . The patient current smoker ( ie , smoke within last 6 month prior screen ) . The patient use systemic immunosuppressive , immunomodulating , biologic agent ( include , limited , antiimmunoglobulin E ( IgE ) mAb , methotrexate , cyclosporin , interferonα , antitumor necrosis factor [ antiTNF ] mAb ) within 6 month prior screen . The patient previously receive antihIL5 monoclonal antibody ( eg , reslizumab , mepolizumab , benralizumab ) . The patient aggravate medical factor inadequately control ( eg , rhinitis , gastroesophageal reflux disease , uncontrolled diabetes ) . The patient participate investigative drug device study within 30 day prior screen . The patient participate investigative biologics study within 6 month prior screen . Other exclusion criterion apply .</criteria>
