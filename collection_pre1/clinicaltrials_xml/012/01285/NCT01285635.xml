	<brief_summary>This study examine effect investigational drug call AT-101 combination FDA approve cancer drug call Docetaxel . It hop AT-101 help Docetaxel well effect slow stop cancer cell growth . This study help researcher learn effect , , combination AT-101 Docetaxel cancer . For instance , combination cause tumor ( ) shrink stop grow ? The researcher also learn safety combination AT-101 Docetaxel . For instance , side effect ? If , kind side effect combination cause ? How severe side effect , often occur ?</brief_summary>
