	<brief_summary>Patients whose temperature drop 36.0 degree Centigrade surgery suffer complication , wound infection increase blood loss , result blood transfusion longer hospital stay n't . There evidence even drop 36.5 degree Centigrade sufficient cause significant adverse effect . Although much evidence regard effectiveness warming long operation , nothing look short procedure undertaken daysurgery setting . A new carbon polymer blanket ( HotDog Augustine Biomedical Design ) show , volunteer study , effective force air warm blanket ( use long operation ) prevent hypothermia . In contrast forced air , carbon polymer reusable low running−costs likely cheap long term . This particularly relevant day surgery set high number patient operate . Additionally , unlike force air warmer , blanket run battery applied moment patient go sleep moment wake could actually prove effective preventing hypothermia clinical setting . This study aim determine whether carbon polymer blanket reduce incidence hypothermia day surgery ( ie . short operating time ) setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recently publish NICE guideline recommend use fluid warmer infusion 500mls forced-air warm blanket main theatre operation . These guideline extrapolate work do long operation . Patients whose temperature drop 36 degree Centigrade surgery suffer complication blood loss whose temperature remain 36 degree Centigrade . They also often require blood transfusion stay hospital longer . Some complication common even temperature drop 36.5 . Disposable forced−air warm blanket prevent hypothermia , re−used therefore incur significant expense term consumables . Re-usable carbon polymer blanket , HotDog , show effective preventing hypothermia , also show maintain core temperature effectively force air blanket . Carbon polymer blanket re-usable , add associate benefit lower running cost . Therefore , face limit NHS resource reusable money save alternative , carbon polymer HotDog , would prefer option disposable force air blanket . The current data effectiveness carbon polymer blanket volunteer . This study actually power show reduction number patient get cold clinical setting . References : NICE .
