	<brief_title>Clinical Variations Pain Assessment Newborns Submitted Intratracheal Aspiration With Open Closed System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Patients underwent tracheal intubation require intratracheal tube secretion suck , open system ( OS ) close system ( CS ) use , order preserve tracheal tube permeability adequate ventilation blood oxygenation . Respiratory hemodynamic complication , well , presence pain possibly experience newborn submit procedure . Objectives : To compare clinical effect identify infant undergo intratracheal aspiration OS CS verify presence intensity pain newborn intratracheal suction , accord system apply . Methods : Clinical , randomize , control , crossover study , perform two neonatal intensive care unit approval ethic committee . The sample consist infant zero seven day age , 26 week gestational age , exclusion criterion use mechanical ventilation high-frequency oscillatory , use inhale nitric oxide , acute phase circulatory failure , central nervous system disorder , without reactivity stimulus , severe asphyxia , Apgar score less three fifth minute , well , presence chromosomal abnormality congenital malformation . After obtain informed consent responsible , child randomly allocate experimental ( CS ) control ( OS ) gruops . The dependent variable study respiratory rate ( RR ) , peripheral oxygen saturation ( SatpO2 ) , heart rate ( HR ) , blood pressure ( BP ) pain , well , complementary variable , collect observation , Premature Infant Pain Profile ( PIPP ) scale application medical record consultation . During data collection period variable observation : T1 ( immediately suction ) , T2 ( suction ) , T3 ( immediately ) T4 ( 10 minute ) . To statistical analysis apply Fisher exact test , McNemar , Binomial , Student test , Wilcoxon Mann Whitney , settle 0.05 level significance . Results : The studied group show significant difference concern complementary variable . There statistically significant influence regard use OS CS intratracheal suction dependent variable study . Clinical consequence observe use system . It demonstrate immediately intratracheal aspiration , newborns high RR average OS ( 58,4±9,6 ) group compare CS ( 56,2±5,9 ) . Average value SatpO2 low OS ( 90,5±4,8 ) group compare CS ( 91,6±4,6 ) . Bradycardia verify group , however , trend toward high mean value HR immediately intratracheal aspiration , especially OS ( 149,5±17,4 ) compare value identify procedure ( 143,2±18,1 ) . There low variation mean BP value two group period assessment , use technique . Regarding pain find , OS average score 7,9±4,4 6,5±3,8 CS , demonstrate presence mild moderate pain . During use OS intratracheal aspiration high pain score ( p=0,038 ) verify newborn female compare male , result observe use CS . Conclusion : There statistically significant difference regard clinical implication , presence intensity pain observe ventilated newborn , accord use OS CS intratracheal aspiration .</detailed_description>
