	<brief_title>Efficacy Nebulised Hypertonic Saline ( 3 % ) Among Children With Bronchiolitis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Rationale : Bronchiolitis common problem significant morbidity , occasional mortality among young infant . Diagnostic testing , indication hospitalization , eligibility criterion discharge therefore , length hospital stay bronchiolitis vary globally , suggest lack consensus opportunity improve care common disorder . Likewise , despite frequency condition single , widely practice , evidence-driven universally accept therapeutic guideline supportive care . Recent study show promising result regard role nebulised 3 % hypertonic saline treatment bronchiolitis . This therapy might obviate need hospital admission reduce length hospital stay , find effective . The implication would child return home early parent return work earlier , result reduction morbidity cost associate disease . Trial Design This study prospective , interventional , parallel-assigned , double-blind , ( subject , caregiver , investigator , outcome assessor ) randomize control trial . Ethical Clearance The study approve Institutional Review Board Ethics Committee , Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital , Institute Medicine well The Institutional Review Board Kanti Children 's Hospital . Study Participants Subjects recruit previously healthy child age 6 week 24 month visit Emergency Room Out-Patient Department Kanti Children Hospital first episode bronchiolitis . Bronchiolitis clinically define per AAP consensus guideline first episode acute wheeze child less two year age , start viral upper respiratory infection ( coryza , cough fever ) . Study set The study carry Emergency Room , Observation Out-Patient Department Kanti Children Hospital , Kathmandu , Nepal . Recruitment occur peak bronchiolitis season January 15th April 15th duration 4 month . Interventions Patient enrollment occur weekday ( Sunday Friday ) approximately 08.00 17.00 hr , initial assessment , attend pediatrician ( non-study physician ) call investigator . The investigator assess child eligibility , examine child assign clinical severity score describe Wang et al . Children meeting inclusion criterion invite participate study write informed consent obtain parent guardian . General condition , weight , temperature , respiratory rate , heart rate , SpO2 presence/absence clinical dehydration assess patient Clinical Severity score calculate described Wang et al . Patients determine life threaten condition immediately manage consider study . Preparation study drug do faculty appoint Department Child Health administration do ER/OPD nurse investigator , compliance medication administration assure investigator 's direct observation nebulization . All eligible patient randomly assign one two group : 1 . Group 1 ( n = 50 ) receive inhalation L-Epinephrine 1.5 mg , dilute 4ml 3 % Hypertonic Saline ( HS ) solution ; 2 . Group 2 ( n=50 ) receive inhalation L-Epinephrine , 1.5 mg , dilute 4ml 0.9 % Normal Saline solution . The study drug administer 0 30 min jet nebulizer use face mask . Prior drug administration 30 , 60 120 min , investigator assess child 's general condition record CS score , SpO2 room air , respiratory rate 60 heart rate . All patient receive first dose nebulization within 15- 30 minute depend upon time require preparation enrollment . Adverse event define heart rate &gt; 200 , tremor , withdrawal study due worsen clinical status , discontinuation study medication due side effect . Patients exclude study administration 2 course nebulisation deliver , study drug delay 10 min ( protocol deviation ) clinical deterioration mandate escalation therapy and/or support . At end observation period , attend pediatrician determine need hospital admission . The parent patient enrol study ask follow 24 hour OPD repeat assessment . If parent available follow , investigator contact parent guardian via telephone 24 hour ED/OPD discharge determine need unscheduled hospital visit within next 24 hour OPD/ ER visit : readmission ( relapse ) rate.In addition , reassess end 1 week telephone contact . A single investigator participate measurement observation minimize inter observer variability . All call make Hospital reception Office appropriate time 10:00a.m . - 14:00p.m NST . Patient label Lost-to-Follow failure communicate 3 consecutive attempt 2 consecutive day 7th 8th day initial presentation OPD/ER . Sample Size Estimation : Sample size determine follow formula : - n = [ ( z1 +z2 ) ² ( Ó1² + Ó2² ) ] / ( û1 - û2 ) ² - Allowing Type1 error 5 % ( α :0.05 ) , z1 score : 1.96 . - For Power 95 % , z2=1.64 . - Standard deviation Clinical Severity Score : 1.3 - Mean Change Clinical Severity Score two intervention consider clinically significant : Change Clinical Severity Score 1 - The study propose difference 1 point Clinical Severity Score two intervention group would consider Clinically Significant . - To detect mean difference 1 unit Clinical severity score , Power 95 % , Sample size 44 intervention group required.This make total 88 patient enrol study.Considering drop out/ lose follow approximately 10 % , 100 patient enrol , allow 50 group . - Standard deviation Change clinical severity score derive previous study take 1.3 . Randomization 1 . Sequence Generation A Random Allocation Software generate computer , identified patient triple digit mixed numeric code use study coordinator allocate patient treatment group , study coordinator person access randomization . 2 . Type Randomization Block Randomization method use stratify patient block 10 , comprise 10 patient . Allocation Concealment After preparation , study solution label code wrap envelope respective code attach proforma bearing respective codes.Study solution identical appearance odor . The identity study solution blind participant , care provider , investigator outcome assessor . Implementation The randomization process do study coordinator ( involve study ) person access code . The study solution store non-freezer compartment refrigerator temperature 2-8*C discard use within 72 hour preparation . Blinding The study Double Blind Randomized Controlled Trial investigator , participant , nurse deliver drug , outcome assessor blind therapeutic option . Statistical Methods The primary outcome detect difference mean change Clinical Severity score two intervention group . A power analysis reveal , detection difference 1 unit CS score 2 treatment group , α 0.05 power 95 % , require 88 patient ( 44 per group ) . A sample size 100 patient therefore chosen , 50 patient group consider possibility loss follow . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS Windows , Release 16.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) . Dichotomous event analyze use Chi-Square test.Dependent variable compare Student t-test . Statistical significance define p-value &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
