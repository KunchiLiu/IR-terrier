	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease genetic red blood cell disorder affect estimate 89,000 Americans , predominantly African ancestry . The leading cause morbidity death sickle cell disease respiratory complication , particularly life-threatening lung disease unique sickle cell disease call `` acute chest syndrome '' . An infectious trigger pro-inflammatory state appear critical mechanism respiratory problem sickling disorder . Emerging evidence vitamin D antimicrobial anti-inflammatory function respiratory tract , recognition widespread vitamin D insufficiency sickle cell child provide compel new rationale vitamin D supplementation sickle cell disease . This open label , single arm study ass efficacy safety oral vitamin D3 100,000 IU administer monthly six month child adolescent sickle cell disease . Twelve pediatric patient sickle cell disease , 3-20 year old , recruit . The primary outcome measure ( efficacy safety ) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration . Other safety measure include serum calcium urinary calcium creatinine . Serial measurement serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D , serum chemistry , urinary calcium creatinine perform baseline entry , monthly six month treatment vitamin D3 , study exit . Other measure relevant plan Phase 2 clinical trial , include marker bone turnover , immune function , inflammation , also obtain baseline , midpoint exit . Recruitment enrollment subject expect 3 months; study assessment 7 month ( 1 month screen 6 month treatment ) ; , remain 2 month devote data collation analysis . Study Procedures Screening : After sign write informed consent parent legal guardian ( assent , applicable ) patient , eligible participant undergo screen examination include standardized history physical examination . A venous blood sample obtain baseline screening measure include serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D , serum chemistry , urine calcium creatinine . Within one month , eligible participant exclusion criterion return enrollment pilot study . Intervention : Participants see monthly administration oral vitamin D3 100,000 IU direct observation Clinical Research Nurse . History examination perform capture symptom sign adverse event . Questionnaires collect data vitamin D calcium dietary intake respiratory event administer . Venous blood urine sample study assessment ( serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D , serum albumin , calcium phosphate , urine calcium creatinine ) obtain visit prior administration study drug .</detailed_description>
