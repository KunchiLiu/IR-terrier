	<brief_summary>Background : - Like complex disease , autoimmune disease result numerous cause , include genetic environmental factor . Some researcher believe people susceptible autoimmune disorder develop body reacts environmental factor create white blood cell attack body tissue , progress autoimmune disease . These immune-triggered disorder overlap one another extent , autoimmune disease certain distinct trigger . - The autoimmune disorder myositis weaken muscle may cause health problem . Environmental exposure associate myositis include ultraviolet radiation , stressful life event muscle overexertion , collagen implant , infection retroviruses streptococci bacteria , certain drug chemical . Some individual myositis also produce protein blood call autoantibody react certain part person cell , call synthetases , involve make new protein . A syndrome call anti-synthetase syndrome , include myositis lung disease , associate anti-synthetase autoantibody . Researchers interested study difference environmental exposure individual myositis . This study conduct determine person anti-synthetase syndrome different environmental exposure disease onset compare patient myositis syndrome also compare healthy volunteer . Objectives : - To determine whether select infectious noninfectious environmental exposure common individual myositis anti-synthetase syndrome , compare healthy volunteer . Eligibility : - Individuals diagnose myositis ( without anti-synthetase autoantibody ) , healthy volunteer without autoimmune disorder . Design : - Participants screen full medical history physical examination , provide blood , urine house dust sample . - Participants complete questionnaire medical history type exposures work , home , elsewhere . Participants myositis also ask certain infection , heavy exercise physical exertion , sun exposure , tobacco alcohol use , stressful event prior diagnose disease . Healthy volunteer ask exposure date diagnosis disease myositis subject match . - Participants receive kit contains instruction filter put onto vacuum clean collect house dust bedroom . This dust keep possible future analyse infectious toxic agent base result study . - Individuals myositis test clinically indicate , include lung function test image study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Most autoimmune disease think develop result chronic immune activation dysregulation select environmental exposure genetically susceptible individual . Based prior study suggest role noninfectious infectious agent development myositis , well know clinical , epidemiologic genetic difference among phenotype , hypothesize different myositis phenotype trigger different environmental exposure genetically susceptible individual . One phenotype particularly well-defined clinically genetically , environmental trigger likely , myositis associate anti-synthetase autoantibody ( define anti-synthetase syndrome ) . These patient acute myositis onset spring year also tend develop fever , elevate white blood cell count , arthritis interstitial lung disease . Although feature consistent environmental trigger anti-synthetase syndrome , although case report animal model suggest infectious noninfectious agent may play role , study systematically assessed environmental agent population . In collaboration multiple center , plan test hypothesis certain environmental exposure associate anti-synthetase syndrome differ see match control myositis patient without anti-synthetase syndrome . The specific aim study : 1 ) determine whether select noninfectious environmental exposure common precede disease onset 150 recent-onset ( define within 24 month meet criterion possible , probable definite myositis ) myositis patient anti-synthetase syndrome , compare 150 control subject without autoimmune disease ( 1:1 match patient ) , compare 150 recent-onset myositis patient without anti-synthetase syndrome ; 2 ) determine whether select infectious agent detect frequently blood sample recent-onset anti-synthetase syndrome patient compare matched control , blood biopsy sample recent-onset anti-synthetase myositis patient compare recent-onset myositis patient without anti-synthetase syndrome . Medical history , concurrent condition environmental questionnaire information collect participant . Subjects undergo clinical , laboratory immunologic assessment document current diagnosis , disease manifestation severity . A chest x-ray , high resolution compute tomography ( HRCT ) chest , pulmonary function test , bronchoalveolar lavage , muscle lung biopsy perform clinically indicate . Blood DNA RNA serum , biopsy house dust repository create current future investigation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : There gender , ethnic age restriction enrollment study . The inclusion criterion enrollment myositis subject : 1 . Diagnosis myositis base criterion possible , probable definite PM DM , without connective tissue disease , document within 24 month enrollment ( use recent diagnosis date define 24 month period ) . 2 . CXR ass possible ILD assign subject presumptive antisynthetase positive negative category clinically indicate . 3 . Children must leas two year age . 4 . Able willing give inform consent , complete questionnaire donate blood sample ( case child least 2 year age &lt; 18 year age , parent/legal guardian must willing able provide inform consent child must provide assent ) . The inclusion criterion control : 1 . Friends , friend available , cousins antisynthetase positive myositis patient , , friends cousin available , volunteer general community ( NIH Normal volunteer program ) , gender age ( within 5 year minor within 10 year adults ) match , live close possible geographic area myositis patient . 2 . Controls without recognize autoimmune disease ILD . 3 . Able willing give inform consent , complete questionnaire donate blood sample ( case child 2 year age &lt; 18 year age , parent/legal guardian must willing able provide inform consent ) child must provide assent ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The exclusion criterion myositis subject : 1 . Cancerassociated myositis ( cancer diagnose within 2 year diagnosis myositis ) . 2 . Inclusion body myositis . 3 . Myositis clearly develop result drug , toxin exposure resolve discontinuation exposure agent . 4 . Children le 2 year age . The exclusion criterion protocol subject : 1 . Medical illness judgment investigator allow safe blood draw clinical evaluation need study participation . 2 . Cognitive impairment . 3 . Not able willing give inform assent consent . 4 . Children le 2 year age . HIV consideration : HIV exclusion affect participant study two follow reason : It impact study procedure test . It may one viral risk factor investigate .</criteria>
