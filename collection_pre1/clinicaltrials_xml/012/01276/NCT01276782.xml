	<detailed_description>Objectives : The investigator hypothesize levothyroxine decrease miscarriage preterm birth . The investigator compare levothyroxine versus placebo determine effect pregnant woman Autoimmune thyroid disease . Background : The last two decade witness explosion new research document deleterious impact thyroid disease pregnancy postpartum period , relation miscarriage , preterm delivery , Intelligence quotient ( IQ ) unborn child health mother postpartum . Both subclinical hypothyroidism thyroid antibody positivity euthyroid woman associate miscarriage preterm delivery . .Even minor perturbation thyroid function link decreased Intelligence Quotients impair neurological development unborn child . Approximately 5 % pregnant woman thyroid disorder ( either subclinical overt hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism ) . Intervention pregnancy levothyroxine euthyroid thyroid antibody positive woman show prospective study , perform area mild iodine deficiency , significantly decrease rate spontaneous miscarriage preterm delivery . SLE also document negatively impact pregnancy . Women systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) increase rate miscarriage preterm delivery , especially set active Systemic lupus erythematosus antiphospholipid antibody . The offspring woman Systemic lupus erythematosus increase risk heart block require neonatal intensive care unit care frequently . Furthermore , pregnant woman Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) increase mortality rate . Women Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) also increase rate hypothyroidism autoimmune thyroid disease ( AITD , define presence thyroid antibody without thyroid dysfunction ) . In recent case-control study perform questionnaire , Yuen et al document 21 % prevalence thyroid disease Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) woman versus 10 % control ( p=0.02 ) . Preterm delivery ( PTD ) , define birth prior 37 week gestation , lead cause neonatal mortality morbidity United States . Despite public health effort decrease prevalence Preterm Delivery ( PTD ) , prevalence increase 11 % 1996 12.7 % 2007 , annual societal cost 26 billion dollar . In attempt affect societal impact preterm delivery , Surgeon General make decrease prevalence Preterm Delivery 7.6 % goal Healthy People 2010 . Although risk factor Preterm Delivery exist , majority woman know risk factor . Recently , hypothyroidism autoimmune thyroid disease also link preterm delivery . Given increase prevalence negative outcome document pregnant woman thyroid disease , increase rate hypothyroidism Autoimmune thyroid disease woman systemic lupus erythematosus , investigator previously evaluate prevalence thyroid disease pregnancy postpartum woman systemic lupus erythematosus , well pregnancy outcome . The investigator determine autoimmune thyroid disease associate preterm delivery miscarriage Hopkins Lupus Cohort . This led application begin pilot randomize clinical trial levothyroxine autoimmune thyroid disease Systemic Lupus Erythematosus pregnancy . Preliminary Data : The prevalence thyroid antibody positivity 31.5 % . Preterm birth strongly associate Autoimmune Thyroid Disease systemic lupus erythematosus ( p=0.002 ) . The investigator find : 1 ) high percentage woman ( 13 % ) thyroid hormone replacement prior become pregnant , 2 ) high percentage woman ( 10.9 % ) present previously undiagnosed subclinical hypothyroidism pregnancy , 3 ) 14 % woman develop postpartum thyroiditis , 4 ) antibody positivity pregnancy predictive occurrence postpartum thyroiditis , 5 ) woman thyroid disease dramatic increase prevalence preterm delivery compare woman thyroid disease . Overall , percentage woman systemic lupus erythematosus either levothyroxine treat thyroid disease prior pregnancy , diagnose thyroid disease pregnancy , develop postpartum thyroiditis , 37.9 % . None demographic , laboratory , medication usage , disease activity index data affect association autoimmune thyroid disease adverse pregnancy outcome . Significance : Preterm delivery markedly increase group Systemic Lupus Erythematosus woman thyroid disease diagnose either prior , , postpartum period , compare group woman thyroid disease free , previous study . Our result affect dosage prednisone administer cardiolipin antibody titer . Furthermore , increase rate preterm delivery Systemic Lupus Erythematosus woman thyroid disease secondary Systemic Lupus Erythematosus activity , Physician Global Assessment score Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index similar Systemic Lupus Erythematosus woman without thyroid disease . These result consistent grow body evidence link thyroid disorder , hypothyroidism autoimmune thyroid antibody euthyroid woman , Preterm delivery . In conclusion , woman Systemic Lupus Erythematosus high prevalence primary hypothyroidism , undiagnosed subclinical hypothyroidism , postpartum thyroiditis . In sum , minimum one every three pregnant woman systemic lupus erythematosus fall one category . Autoimmune thyroid disease highly associated adverse pregnancy outcomes . Our current application begin pilot trial levothyroxine versus placebo United States sit long track record interest Systemic Lupus Erythematosus pregnancy . Study Procedures Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) define American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) classification criterion Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics revise American College Rheumatology criterion . Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) patient already levothyroxine discover hypothyroid needing levothyroxine , exclude . Pregnant Systemic lupus erythematosus patient autoimmune thyroid antibody give inform consent randomize levothyroxine ( 50mcg ) versus placebo . Outcome measure follow use Predictors Pregnancy Outcome : Biomarkers Anti-Phospholipid Antibody Syndrome ( APS ) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) ( PROMISSE ) study . The outcome adverse pregnancy outcome ( preterm birth , miscarriage , stillbirth ) . The endpoint adverse pregnancy outcome define Promisse study The composite endpoint define occurrence one follow event : 1 . Otherwise unexplained fetal death occur 12 week gestation 2 . Neonatal death prior hospital discharge due complication prematurity 3 . Indicated preterm delivery prior 36 week ' gestation gestational hypertension , preeclampsia-eclampsia , placental insufficiency 4 .

Chakravarty , M.D. ) . Dr D. Ware Branch University Utah gynecologic consultant adjudicate outcome . TSH test perform use Ultrasensitive hTSH II method AbbottAxsym . ( Abbott Diagnostics , Abbott Park , Illinois . ) This Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay ( MEIA ) method . The analytical sensitivity Axsym Ultrasensitive hTSH II 0.03 uIU/mL . The intraassay coefficient variation ( CV ) 4.35 % interassay coefficient variation ( CV ) 5.73 % . A TSH great 2.5 μU/ml first trimester , great 3.0 μU/ml second third trimester consider abnormal . Glinoer et al demonstrate 18 % woman without thyroid disease suppress Thyroid Stimulating Hormone ( TSH ) . Therefore , previous study TSH value 0.3 μU/ml consider abnormal pregnancy unless occur 20th week gestation . Serum thyroglobulin antibody ( Tg-Ab ) thyroid peroxidase antibody ( TPO-Ab ) , also research test , measure enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( KRONUS KalibreTM Thyroglobulin Antibody Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody ELISA kit kindly provide KRONUS Corp , Boise , ID ) . Serum anti-Tg level 3 U/mL consider positive anti-TPO level 2 U/mL consider positive . Study duration number study visit require research participant : The study duration upto 36 week pregnancy screen . The patient see monthly use accepted clinical guideline devise PROMISSE ( Predictors Pregnancy Outcome : Biomarkers Anti-Phospholipid Antibody Syndrome ( APS ) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) ) study , National Institute Health fund prospective study role antiphospholipid antibody pregnancy .
