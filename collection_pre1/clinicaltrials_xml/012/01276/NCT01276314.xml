	<brief_summary>Severe skin adverse drug reaction result death . Toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) high mortality ( 30-35 % ) ; Stevens-Johnson syndrome transitional form correspond syndrome , less extensive skin detachment low mortality ( 5-15 % ) . Hypersensitivity syndrome , sometimes call Drug Reaction Eosinophilia Systemic Symptoms ( DRESS ) , mortality rate evaluate 10 % . The aim project ( 1 ) compare effect treatment systemic steroid anti-TNF α . Including skin re-epithelization time , internal organ recovery time , mortality rate , ( 2 ) investigate pathogenesis severe cutaneous adverse reaction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Severe cutaneous adverse drug reaction , include Toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , Stevens-Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) , Drug Reaction Eosinophilia Systemic Symptoms ( DRESS ) life threaten disease . There gold standard therapy SCAR . Treatment highdose systemic glucocorticoid controversial . Although recent report success various therapy plasmapheresis high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin , efficacy yet prove . Assessment therapy difficult non-specific immunosuppressant immunomodulating mode action . Recent study show evidence pathogenetic importance tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) -a,6 suggest new therapeutic approach selective blockade TNF-a use specific antibody . We report successful treatment TEN use monoclonal IgG anti-TNF-antibodies . The aim project ( 1 ) compare effect treatment systemic steroid anti-TNF α . Including skin re-epithelization time , internal organ recovery time , mortality rate . ( 2 ) investigate pathogenesis severe cutaneous adverse reaction . This open-label , prospective , randomized , control study . Total 90 SCAR patient collect . Including criterion : Patients diagnose SCAR , include SJS , TEN , DRESS . And age patient 18 year-old . Exclusive criterion : pregnancy breast-feeding woman , allergy anti-TNF-α agent , active tuberculosis , active infection systemic disease , active HBV HCV hepatitis , immunocompromise patient .</detailed_description>
