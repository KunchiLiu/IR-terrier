	<brief_title>Weekly Doses Cilengitide Paclitaxel Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) cilengitide paclitaxel weekly dose schedule . ( Cohort I ) II . To describe toxicity associate cilengitide paclitaxel . III . To describe antitumor activity cilengitide paclitaxel weekly dose schedule . IV . To characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) cilengitide paclitaxel propose schedule correlate PK parameter clinical outcome . ( Cohort I ) V. To examine effect cilengitide paclitaxel circulate cysteine-rich , angiogenic inducer , 61 ( Cyr61 ) use novel `` sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) '' correlate effect clinical response . ( Cohort II ) VI . To evaluate information obtain use item Patient-Reported Outcomes Version Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( PRO-CTCAE ) Phase I study . VII . To determine tumor tissue expression alpha v beta 3 ( αvβ3 ) CYR61 correlate therapeutic response cilengitide paclitaxel . ( Cohort II ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study cilengitide . Patients receive cilengitide intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour days* 1 , 8 , 15 paclitaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Some patient receive cilengitide IV 1 hour day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
