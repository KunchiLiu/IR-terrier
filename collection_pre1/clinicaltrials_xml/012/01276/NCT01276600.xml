	<brief_summary>Describe dose-proportionality intra-individual variability tenofovir diphosphate ( TFV-DP ) emtricitabine triphosphate ( FTC-TP ) steady-state healthy human participant take TruvadaÂ® ( FTC 200mg/TDF 300 mg ) direct observation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Proportionality Intra-Individual Variability Intracellular TFV-DP FTC-TP Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This PK study design establish dose-proportionality TFV FTC ( serum intracellular form ) daily weekly dosing . This information essential ( 1 ) employ drug concentration adherence measure future PrEP study , ( 2 ) estimate anticipate concentration parent active moiety TFV FTC intermittent PrEP regimens associate full adherence prescribe regimen . In addition , intra-individual variability assess improve sample size estimate future PrEP study use drug concentration adherence measure PK-PD correlation plan . The dose-proportionality intra-cellular phosphate two component study product previously establish . Given complexity movement drug body compartment ( central compartment , vaginal mucosal tissue , vaginal lumen , gastrointestinal mucosal tissue , gastrointestinal lumen ) , cell within compartment , intra-cellular phosphorylation , possible non-dose proportional kinetics , mixed zero-order saturable process may operate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants meet follow criterion eligible inclusion study : 18 44 year age , inclusive date screening . Provides inform consent study . Nonreactive HIV rapid test result screen enrollment visit . An estimate calculated creatinine clearance ( eCcr ) least 70 mL/min CockcroftGault formula : eCcr ( female ) mL/min = [ ( 140 age year ) x ( weight kg ) x 0.85 ] / ( 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL ) . eCcr ( male ) mL/min = [ ( 140 age year ) x ( weight kg ) ] / ( 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL ) . Participants sexually active , define least one sex ( vaginal anal intercourse ) act 30 day prior screen . Participants must agree use condom coital event study participation . Intensive sample cohort : Not use spermicide mean birth control ( conjunction condom diaphragm ) Women must : Be premenopausal Have regular menstrual cycle least 21 day menses ( unless contraception cause amenorrhea irregular menses ) Have negative urine pregnancy test screening enrollment Be utilize alternative method birth control addition condom ( hormonal contraceptive , diaphragm undergone surgical sterilization ) vasectomize exclusive male partner . Intensive sample cohort : Have cervix Have documentation normal Pap smear within 12 month At screening : : Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) great 1.5 X site laboratory ULN ( upper limit normal ) Hemoglobin le 10.0 g/dL Platelet count le 100,000/mm3 Serum phosphate level site laboratory LLN ( low limit normal ) INR aPTT great site laboratory ULN Other safety test ( bicarbonate ( HCO3 ) , potassium ( K ) , chloride ( Cl ) , sodium ( Na ) , calcium ( Ca ) , fast glucose ) result outside laboratory reference range 1+ great protein urine dipstick test 1+ great glucose urine dipstick test Cultureconfirmed urinary tract infection Coenrollment HIV interventional research study ( exclude behavioral intervention ) prior enrollment active arm HIV vaccine trial . Clinically apparent patient report active skin disorder include : rash , pruritus , maculopapular rash , urticaria , vesiculobullous rash , pustular rash . Women pregnant breastfeeding . One reactive HIV rapid test result screen enrollment , even HIV infection confirm . Positive hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) test . Excessive use alcohol ( 4 drink day regular basis ) . Interleukin therapy ; medication significant nephrotoxic potential , include limited amphotericin B , aminoglycosides , cidofovir , foscarnet systemic chemotherapy ; medication may inhibit compete elimination via active renal tubular secretion ( include limit probenecid ) . Participants history gastrectomy , colostomy , ileostomy , procedure alter gastrointestinal tract drug absorption . Intensive sample cohort : A positive test syphilis , gonorrhea , Chlamydia A positive test HSV2 ( individual active lesion ) Findings consistent bacterial vaginosis , vaginal candidiasis , trichomonas ( woman ) History STI within 3 month prior enrollment Medications prolong clot time ( e.g. , warfarin , heparin , clopidogrel class . ) Abnormalities colorectal mucosa , significant colorectal symptom ( ) , opinion clinician represent contraindication biopsy ( include limit presence unresolved injury , infectious inflammatory condition local mucosa , presence symptomatic external hemorrhoid ) . Clinically apparent pelvic exam finding ( observe study staff ) genital lesion , erythema , edema abnormal physical pelvic exam finding , opinion investigator designee , would contraindicate study participation . Women cervical procedure ( conization , LEEP procedure , cryosurgery ) within previous 6 month . Spermicide method contraception within last 30 day Any reason condition judgment investigator , would make participation study unsafe , complicate interpretation study outcome data , otherwise interfere achieve study objective .</criteria>
