	<brief_title>Tissue Pharmacokinetics Intraoperative Gemcitabine Resectable Adenocarcinoma Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Gemcitabine drug use treat pancreatic cancer . However , study show gemcitabine able enter pancreatic cancer cell . Surgery : Your surgery perform way would even take part study . You sign separate consent form surgery . The length surgery time anesthesia change take part study . To try find gemcitabine enters pancreas cancer cell , participant pancreatic cancer remove surgery receive infusion gemcitabine surgery . Some pancreatic cancer tissue remove check learn gemcitabine find cancer cell . During surgery , routine procedure learn disease spread area . If disease spread beyond pancreas , surgical removal possible . If reason surgery , surgeon decides removal pancreas possible , receive gemcitabine participation study end . If sign spread reason cancer remove , surgeon begin process removal disease . Gemcitabine Infusion : You receive infusion gemcitabine surgeon begin remove cancer . Gemcitabine give infusion catheter place operating room asleep . The infusion take either 50 100 minute , depend upon join study . The first 2 participant receive gemcitabine 50 minute rest participant ( 18 ) receive gemcitabine 100 minute . The infusion catheter require study standard care procedure participant pancreatic cancer surgery . You sign separate consent form infusion catheter . Blood Tissue Collection : Up 10 blood sample ( 1 tablespoon time ) drawn surgery start gemcitabine infusion begin end surgery . The blood sample use measure level gemcitabine blood different time point . This call pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . The blood also use biomarker test . Biomarkers chemical `` marker '' blood/tissue may relate reaction study drug . Some tumor tissue normal tissue remove surgery collect learn gemcitabine able enter tissue cell biomarker test . Length Study : Your active participation study surgery complete follow-up . The research team continue collect information 30 day surgery ( longer side effect ) . Follow-Up : The study team follow health status 30 day surgery check side effect gemcitabine . This follow-up do daily hospital recover surgery . Follow-up also occur time routine clinic visit , phone call least weekly . These call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Gemcitabine FDA approve commercially available treatment pancreatic cancer . Its use surgery investigational . Up 20 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Cytologic histologic proof adenocarcinoma pancreas require . Patients Islet cell tumor eligible . 2 . Patients know metastasis . 3 . Patients must potentially resectable pancreatic cancer agree undergo surgical resection M D Anderson Cancer Center . They undergo stag ( physical examination , chest xray , contrast enhance CT MRI ( CT contraindicate ) and/or angiogram determine resectability . Potentially resectable define : No extrapancreatic disease ; No evidence ( CT/MRI ) tumor extension celiac axis SMA ; No evidence ( CT/MRI angiogram ) occlusion SMV SMPV confluence . 4 . Patients Karnofsky performance status great 70 eligible . 5 . There upper age restriction . Patients le 18 year age exclude protocol adenocarcinoma pancreas rarely see pediatric population . 6 . Adequate renal , bone marrow function : Leukocytes &gt; = 3,000/uL ; Absolute neutrophil count &gt; = 1,500/uL ; Platelets &gt; = 100,000/Ul ; Serum creatinine &lt; = 2.0 mg/dL . 7 . Adequate Hepatic function ( endoscopic percutaneous drainage need ) : Total bilirubin &lt; = 3 X institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; = 5 X institutional ULN . 8 . Patients must fever evidence infection coexist medical condition would preclude administration gemcitabine . Patients uncontrolled congestive heart failure , unstable angina myocardial infarction within 3 month exclude . 9 . Patient pregnant . Women childbearing potential ( define undergone hysterectomy postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month ) must agree practice adequate contraception refrain breastfeeding , specify informed consent . 10 . Patients must sign studyspecific consent form . 1 . Patient receive preoperative chemotherapy and/or radiation . 2 . Major cardiovascular pulmonary comorbidity precludes use general anesthesia . 3 . Identification metastatic disease . 4 . Inability comply study and/or followup procedure . 5 . Patients &lt; 18 year age .</criteria>
