	<brief_summary>Rationale : Magnetic navigation complex lesions/vessels may result reduce contrast irradiation patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention . The investigator aim compare use 2 technique . Objective : To compare use contrast irradiation use magnetically navigated PCI ( MPCI ) conventional guidewire PCI ( CPCI ) patient complex anatomy ( defined clinical prediction rule ) . Study design : Prospective randomise control , single-blind trial Study population : Healthy human volunteer age 18 80 year age Intervention ( applicable ) : One group placement angioplasty wire magnetic navigation angioplasty wire place conventional technique . All intervention perform per routine practice . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary endpoint The primary endpoint amount contrast use . Secondary endpoint 1 . Contrast need cross lesion 2. procedural time 3. radiation exposure 4 . Clinical complication 1 12 month 5. procedural success Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The index procedure perform per normal routine include history examination . A blood test take vascular access obtain . After procedure questionnaire fill . The patient blood test 2 3 day procedure , telephone follow-up occur 1 6 month outpatient visit ECG plan year index procedure . No additional significant physical psychological discomfort expect participation study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Stereotaxis Niobe® magnetic navigation system receive regulatory approval human clinical use interventional cardiology 2003 . Magnetic navigation give 3 dimensional ( 3D ) directional control guide-wire tip percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) procedure . Magnetic navigation show feasible effective ( 1-3 ) , case report suggest enables performance procedure could successfully finish conventionally ( 4-6 ) , use system may lead reduction contrast use procedure time ( 7-11 ) expect result well patient outcome , economical advantage ( less consumables per procedure , procedure per session ) . There center perform magnetic navigation percutaneous coronary intervention The OLVG perform procedure center include patient registry . The registry OLVG suggest different subgroup derive different benefit . Distal lesion ( 10 ) define lesion distal first 2 coronary segment aorta ( thus RCA segment , mid LAD distal Cx ) . Technical success differ significantly magnetic conventional PCI ( 88.5 vs 96.2 % ; p=0.14 ) . Significantly short procedural fluoroscopy time observe magnetic compare conventional PCI ( 29.9±17.1 vs 42.9±21.1 min , p &lt; 0.001 ; 8.2±7.7 v 16.7±22.4 min , p=0.01 respectively ) . More contrast use de conventional PCI group ( 54 ml/patient ; P=0.02 ) . These advantage result mean saving 1652 euro per patient ( P &lt; 0.0001 ) . Primary PCI ( 11 ) The technical success rate high MPCI CPCI group ( 95.4 % vs 98 % ; P = NS ) . There significantly less contrast usage MPCI compare CPCI group ( 167±80/patient vs 220±87/patient ; P &lt; 0.001 ) . Procedural time significantly different MPCI compare CPCI ( 30.8±16.5 min v 33.6±15.8 min , p=0.2 ) fluoroscopy time significantly better ( 8.1±5.0 min v 14.6±26.5 min , p &lt; 0.05 ) . Simple lesion ( 8 ) define elective treatment single discrete stenosis would require maximum two stent exclude multiple lesion target vessel , multi-vessel PCI , bifurcation lesion , acute chronic total occlusion , previous fail conventional attempt target lesion . Procedural fluoroscopy time significantly different MPCI compare CPCI ( 21.0±14.5 min v 24.7±14.0 min ; 4.9±4.8 min v 7.3±10.3 min , p=NS ) . There significant reduction median contrast use ( 60 ml/patient [ 41-100 ] v 100 ml/patient [ 64-130 ] ; P=0.006 ) . Summary Benefit appear increase depend complexity vessel/lesion distal lesion show significant benefit term contrast use , procedure time fluoroscopy time . Simple lesion show procedures negatively influenced term time , irradiation may benefit term contrast use . Acute procedure time premium ( primary PCI heart attack ) slow use system . Furthermore , investigator publish clinical prediction rule selection patient benefit technology . ( 12 ) The use system may number benefit 1 . Reduction procedure time , irradiation contrast use patient 2 . Better procedure wire passage maintains tip coaxial vessel avoid inadvertent sidebranch cannulation accurate bend/sidebranch entry produce less complication The hypothesis MPCI good CPCI investigate randomize control trial ( Magnetic navigation wire placement vs conventional wire placement ) . The investigator plan randomize patient magnetic conventional group . Endpoints : 1 . Primary endpoint Contrast use 2 . Secondary : Short-term procedural Procedure Fluoroscopy Procedure time Procedure success Short term contrast nephropathy 3 . Long-term MACCE 1 month 12 month .</detailed_description>
