	<brief_title>Effects Noradrenaline Administration Combined With Restrictive Intraoperative Fluid Substitution Perioperative Outcome Patients Undergoing Radical Cystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Perioperative fluid management abdominal surgery subject controversy current standard fluid therapy evidence base . Standard fluid therapy include replacement basic fluid requirement , loss perspiration , exsudation surgical wound , loss third space . Fluid preload spinal epidural anaesthesia common recognize practice clinical anaesthesia . Vasodilatation well-known side effect halogenics , hypnotic opiate . Compensating decrease blood pressure volume substitution common praxis . Alternatively fall blood pressure due vasodilatation correct apply vasoactive agent . A review data effect `` high volume '' perioperative fluid therapy suggest overhydration may deleterious effect cardiopulmonary function ( excessive shift right Starling myocardial performance curve , pneumonia respiratory failure ) well recovery gastrointestinal motility ( prolonged postoperative ileus ( PI ) ) , tissue oxygenation wound heal ( anastomosis leakage ) . A postoperative weight gain 3-7 kg patient major elective surgery therefore seem represent genuine fluid overload . Delay bowel motility may due presence excess fluid intestinal wall result excess perioperative fluid therapy . Increased gut permeability surgical trauma may also contribute development PI enhance uptake luminal bacterial product . Postoperative complication significantly reduce restrict fluid therapy . A dose response relation administrate fluid volume postoperative complication ( cardiopulmonary tissue heal ) find randomise assessor blind multicenter trial colorectal surgery 11,12 . The restricted fluid regimen lead haemodynamic instability amount vasoactive substance administer similar . No significant difference urinary output demonstrate day 1 6 . Restrictive fluid administration fast-track surgery lead difference all-over recovery colonic surgery . Goal-directed intraoperative fluid administration use oesophageal Doppler monitor maintain maximal stroke volume show reduce length hospital stay , low incidence postoperative nausea vomit encourage early return bowel function . Oesophageal Doppler monitor permit rapid , minimally invasive continuous estimation cardiac output . It easily insert associated major complication . The investigator use oesophageal Doppler monitoring intraoperative monitoring stroke volume cardiac output . In animal experiment pig , high ( 18ml/kg/h ) low ( 3ml/kg/h ) volume crystalloid fluid treatment effect colon tissue oxygenation tension . Three different fluid volume regimen ( 3ml/kg/h , 7 ml/kg/h 20ml/kg/h ) test affect tissue oxygen pressure jejunum colon , suggest efficient autoregulation intestinal blood flow healthy pig undergo uncomplicated abdominal surgery 25 . Noradrenaline increase systemic blood flow ( mean arterial pressure cardiac index ) fail increase microcirculatory blood flow abdominal organ septic pig . Thoracic epidural anesthesia per se affect intravascular volume . Therefore , vasopressor preferable treatment hypotension epidural anesthesia . The incidence postoperative cognitive dysfunction varies greatly report rate 10 % 55 % . Patient characteristic age , education , type length surgical procedure preoperative cognitive status find affect incidence severity postoperative cognitive dysfunction . The influence intraoperative volume management cognitive function assess . It seem interest safe use noradrenaline perfusor combine low volume regimen open radical cystectomy . The low volume regimen , describe study protocol , well establish institution , large experience cystectomy . Objective The aim study compare intraoperative blood loss , quality surgical field ( defined later ) , metabolic response , pain relief , fatigue score , gastrointestinal function , cardiovascular , pulmonary , infectious surgical complication cognitive function two group patient undergo radical cystectomy . The first group treat accord internationally accept standard fluid regimen ( 6 ml/kg/h crystalloids correction hypotony fluid bolus ) ; second one treat restrictive fluid regimen 2ml/kg/h crystalloids combination sympathicomimetics . Methods Prospective , randomise , control , single-centre study . Randomly assign equal proportion computer receive dry regimen 2ml/kg/h combine sympathicomimetics standard fluid management . An advanced balanced electrolyte solution use contain acetate/malate instead lactate . Substantial advantage base excess +/- O mmol/l , isotonic , contain anion acetate malate . 208 patient open radical cystectomy Duration : 36 month Setting : University Department Urology , Inselspital Bern , Switzerland Study sample power calculation A power analysis postoperative complication rate primary outcome do NCSS PASS programme : Power : 80 % Significance : 0.05 % low Complication rate restrictive volume regimen group : 20 % Complication rate control group : 38 % 83 patient require group . Assuming 20 % drop-out rate 104 patient per group enrol .</detailed_description>
