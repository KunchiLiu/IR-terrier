	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sorafenib tosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Giving sorafenib tosylate together SRS may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose sorafenib tosylate give together SRS treat patient brain metastasis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate Stereotactic Radiosurgery Treating Patients With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety , tolerability maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) sorafenib , administer combination SRS patient 1-4 metastatic brain tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess six-month intra-cranial progression-free survival ( PFS ) sorafenib administer combination SRS patient 1-4 metastatic brain tumor . PFS define time intra-cranial tumor progression death . II . To assess six-month overall survival ( OS ) sorafenib administer combination SRS patient 1-4 metastatic brain tumor . III . To compare result patient treated SRS alone ( concurrent control ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study sorafenib tosylate . Patients receive oral ( PO ) sorafenib tosylate daily undergo SRS 5-7 day later . Treatment sorafenib continue 2 week SRS absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 8 , 26 , 52 week .</detailed_description>
