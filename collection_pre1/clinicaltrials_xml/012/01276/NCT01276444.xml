	<brief_summary>Valvular repair repair surgery rapidly progress yet rather challenge aspect current cardiosurgical practice . Several approach introduce clinical practice alleviate systemic inflammatory response induce cardiopulmonary bypass organ-specific injury include meticulous haemodynamic monitoring , pharmacological heart preconditioning , systemic use anti-inflammatory agent , prevention coagulopathy , induced topical systemic hypothermia . An in-depth monitoring haemodynamics , oxygen transport , vascular permeability great clinical value control efficacy approach . Therefore , aim study compare two algorithms goal-directed therapy aim achieve postoperative haemodynamic optimization combine valve repair surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Forty-three adult patient schedule elective two valve replacement/repair enrol randomise single-centre study . All intervention perform cardiosurgical department City hospital # 1 ( Arkhangelsk , Russian Federation ) surgical team . Three patient exclude analysis ; two — due protocol violation one — due inadequate surgical correction diagnose intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography . Day surgery patient ask informed consent randomize two group . In first group postoperative haemodynamic optimization target parameter provide pulmonary artery catheter ( PAC-group , n = 20 ) : pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure , cardiac index ( LifeScope monitor , Nihon Kohden , Japan ) hemoglobin blood level . In second group haemodynamics manage use parameter give transpulmonary thermodilution ( COMPLEX-group ) , include cardiac index , global end-diastolic volume index , extravascular lung water index , continuous central venous oxygen saturation , oxygen delivery index measure PiCCO2 monitor ( Pulsion Medical Systems , Munich , Germany . In addition , mean arterial pressure , heart rate , hemoglobin concentration include PAC- PiCCO2-driven protocol .</detailed_description>
