	<brief_summary>Radial arterial cannulation common invasive procedure real-time measurement arterial blood pressure . Placement arterial catheter use conventional palpation often relatively easy quick , always true . A relatively new method direct visualization artery use two-dimensional ultrasound . This technique allow cannulation artery take place real-time visualization may increase success rate first time pas needle . Another technique utilize Doppler also proven effective cannulate radial artery . This technique utilize change acoustic pitch probe pass directly artery . The primary objective study compare first attempt success rate radial artery cannulation among palpation , Doppler U/S guide technique apply trainee . Secondary outcome include : success rate within 5 minute , successful , number attempt require , correlation success rate operator experience successful cannulation radial artery .</brief_summary>
