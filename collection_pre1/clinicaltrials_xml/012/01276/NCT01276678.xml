	<brief_summary>About 13 million people United States coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . It lead cause death men woman . Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) occur blood vessel supply blood heart muscle ( coronary artery ) become hardened narrowed . The artery harden narrow due buildup fatty calcify material call plaque inner wall . The buildup plaque also call atherosclerosis . This process start early life , influenced multiple factor . Several factor increase risk develop atherosclerosis . They include high blood pressure , smoking , diabetes , high cholesterol relate someone heart attack stroke . The risk factor , great chance severe atherosclerosis . Some risk factor modify , like age family history early heart disease . The influenceable factor include high blood pressure , high blood cholesterol , high blood sugar , cigarette smoking , overweight obesity , lack physical activity . Nevertheless , patient without mention risk factor develop atherosclerosis . In addition , also patient several risk factor develop severe coronary artery disease . According research study high blood level substance blood ( biochemical marker ) well gene DNA cell may associate increase risk develop CAD faster progression disease . The purpose study find correlation certain blood marker growth plaque , regardless presence classic risk factor atherosclerosis . If prove hypothesis one step closer predict extent atherosclerosis perform certain blood test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , primarily coronary artery disease lead cause death disability United States Europe . The cost cardiovascular disease United States 2009 estimate $ 475.3 billion , accord American Heart Association National Heart , Lung , Blood Institute . Although significant accomplishment reduce cardiovascular event past decade , many people still die heart vascular disease . Therefore , improvement risk stratification CVD identification new biomarkers extensively investigate primary secondary clinical setting past decade . A substantial number biomarkers , represent various stage atherogenesis impaired cardiac function , evaluate modifiable traditional risk factor , cholesterol , blood pressure , smoke status , diabetes . However , little know true extent identify multi-analyte , genetic , thrombogenic marker contribute presence degree atherosclerosis . Patients severe stenosis coronary artery may different profile biochemical genetic marker patient `` clear '' coronary vessel . Therefore , research require improve predictability specificity know novel factor physician fully implement test routine clinical practice . At present , physician rely conventional cardiovascular risk factor try identify at-risk patient . A number risk factor stem genetic biologic condition gender , age , ethnicity family history heart disease . While many risk factor change , risk factor high cholesterol , high blood pressure , obesity , tobacco smoking , stress , physical inactivity modify . One significant risk factor development CVD diabetes mellitus , whereby heredity lifestyle play major role . Nevertheless , patient without known classical risk factor develop severe CVD . Conversely , patient classical risk factor without relevant coronary artery disease . `` The CVD Risk Factor Paradox '' may explain combination biological , environmental , genetic factor investigation . Animal human study establish role cholesterol development progression atherosclerosis . Epidemiological study directly implicate LDL-C development atherosclerosis CVD . Furthermore , LDL-C level appear directly relate development recurrence CVD . While LDL-C primary lipid marker assess risk , evidence demonstrate important role lipoproteins component atherogenesis . These include lipoprotein ( ) , LDL pattern density , HDL subtypes , VLDL , intermediate-density lipoprotein . A substantial body evidence also demonstrate Lp-PLA2 cardiovascular risk marker primary secondary prevention provide new information , new traditional risk factor . Most recently oxidize low-density lipoprotein ( oxLDL ) / β2-glycoprotein I ( β2GPI ) complex implicate atherogenesis . More accurate expand depiction lipid profile compare standard lipid profile may identify important emerge risk factor secondary target therapy cardiovascular disease . It also establish heighten plaque metabolism together increase blood vulnerability characterize hypercoagulability , heighten platelet reactivity inflammation , important process responsible plaque rupture subsequent occlusive ischemic event occurrence ACS . Recent development catheter-based near-infrared spectroscopy may help identify vulnerable plaque characterize chemical component . However , information regard blood vulnerability base specific biomarker profile lack . Multiple line evidence suggest critical role platelet development atherosclerosis thrombosis . By express adhesion molecule platelet facilitate diapedesis leukocyte vascular wall atherosclerotic development . Additionally , P-selectin CD40L trigger release RANTES platelet subsequently augment monocyte recruitment secretion inflammatory cytokine monocyte . Previous study demonstrate role MCP-1 IL-8 plaque development cardiovascular clinical outcome . Gurbel et . al . demonstrate incremental change platelet function , demonstrate increase GPIIb/IIIa expression increase release RANTES , IL-8 MCP-1 , clinical disease progress asymptomatic state stable angina finally unstable angina.These finding reinforce critical role platelet plaque destabilization . The role inflammation atherosclerotic plaque rupture subsequent development thrombus generation site plaque rupture enhance tissue factor expression thrombin generation well recognize . Several study demonstrate association high IL-6 , -8 , -18 , elevate CD40 ligand ( CD40L ) , myeloperoxidase , tumor necrosis factor CRP level ischemic event . Epidemiological evidence addition experimental clinical data support hypothesis CRP may `` marker '' well active participant development atherothrombotic complication . More interestingly , recent vitro study suggest direct role CRP endothelial platelet function . In autopsy study , CRP immune reactivity detect atherosclerotic artery normal artery . In addition , level CRP fibrous tissue atheroma atherectomy specimens high patient unstable angina myocardial infarction compare patient stable angina . Gurbel et al . demonstrate statistically significant increase specific inflammation marker , importantly CRP , IL-8 , RANTES MCP-1 patient progressive CAD compare patient asymptomatic disease . Although serial change marker study patient , incremental change among various marker across study population , clearly suggest transition disease state . Linking vulnerable blood characterize elevated inflammation marker , hypercoagulability , highly reactive platelet vulnerable patient risk thrombotic complication subject much discussion recent year . Platelet activation aggregation critical factor generation ischemic event , include stent thrombosis myocardial infarction ( MI ) . Unlike routine measurement blood glucose , cholesterol C-reactive protein perform management patient atherosclerosis , measurement platelet function largely ignored management cardiovascular patient , even high risk . Multiple laboratory translational research study perform research center well others demonstrate importance platelet reactivity new emerge risk factor . At center primarily utilize two method determine coagulation platelet reactivity , thrombelastography ( TEG ) platelet aggregation . The indication TEG test include assess bleed unclear etiology , assess hypercoagulable state . In addition , TEG platelet map utilized monitor antiplatelet therapy . It hypothesize high platelet-fibrin clot strength measure TEG predicts robust clot formation site plaque rupture . In support premise , Gurbel et al . demonstrate high thrombin-induced platelet-fibrin clot strength high platelet reactivity associate ischemic event patient CVD . In fact , current data support uniform measurement on-treatment platelet reactivity may major diagnostic strategy , treatment patient undergone PCI , also patient cardiovascular disease risk thrombotic event . Presently , gold standard diagnose patient CVD coronary angiography . If significant lesion detect , coronary intervention angioplasty coronary artery bypass grafting perform reestablish flow block coronary artery . Modification cardiovascular risk factor pharmacological management subsequently implement prevent recurrent cardiovascular event include myocardial infarction stent thrombosis . The importance ADP-P2Y12 receptor interaction COX-inhibition demonstrate clinical benefit associate addition clopidogrel aspirin therapy patient acute coronary syndrome patient treat stent . However , '' one size fit '' antiplatelet management strategy proven flaw due clopidogrel aspirin response variability . Incomplete inhibition platelet thromboxane generation associate increase risk cardiovascular event . In CHARISMA study , Eikelboom et . al . demonstrate urinary concentration 11-dehydro thromboxane B2 potentially modifiable determinant stroke , myocardial infarction , cardiovascular death patient risk atherothrombotic event . In addition , variability clopidogrel response well establish multiple translational research study demonstrate relationship antiplatelet nonresponsiveness , high on-treatment platelet reactivity , occurrence ischemic event percutaneous coronary intervention patient . Recently , loss-of-function CYP2C19*2 allele show associated decreased activation clopidogrel antiplatelet effect increase cardiovascular event patient receive clopidogrel . Individuals genotype reduce protection thrombotic event outline FDA black box warn clopidogrel . Despite black box warning , large scale study perform personalize antiplatelet treatment P2Y12 inhibitor CYP2C19 genotyping primarily technology point-of-care genotyping commercially available . From clinical perspective , report 2C19 test result rapid fashion help guide therapeutic decision patient inpatient set prior discharge . Large-scale genome-wide association study use high-density , single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping array reveal genetic variant robustly associate CAD CAD-related trait type 2 diabetes obesity . Also , evidence obtain multiple rare allele fairly strong phenotypic effect may contribute genetic heritability CAD Although , involvement specific gene level contribution CAD establish research , know CAD often result blend effect multiple gene . These so-called polygenic effect mean genetics CAD extremely complicate , many different gene influence person 's risk . In case , CAD inherit clearly dominant recessive manner . Instead , person may mutations gene increase risk mutation gene decrease risk , combine effect play role development atherosclerosis . At present replication result report study poor , probably lack high-quality environmental data count gene-environment interaction . Many patient undetected coronary artery disease , accurately identify , would lead aggressive early treatment strategy , include lifestyle modification target pharmacologic therapy . A goal current study determine potential biochemical genetic marker associate presence progression CVD . The current study hypothesis specific biomarkers genetic profile precisely identify severity angiographically-defined coronary lesion , independently classic risk factor atherosclerosis . The investigator believe enhance treatment patient cardiovascular disease implement personalized treatment strategy . 3 . STUDY DESIGN 3.1 . Outline A total 1300 subject 's ≥18 year undergo coronary angiography ( inpatient cohort ) undergone coronary angiography within 5 year ( outpatient cohort , exceed 50 subject ) enrol . In addition , 300 healthy control free pharmacologic therapy also enrol . After give informed consent , lifestyle questionnaire topic diet , physical activity , history high blood pressure , hyperlipidemia , diabetes , smoke family history early heart disease complete . A blood ( approximately 35 ml ) urine sample obtain prior angiogram inpatient cohort , day enrollment outpatient cohort laboratory assessment . The presence severity CAD determine accord follow three category : category 1 - disease minimal stenosis ( &lt; 25 % ) major branch without need medical therapy ; category 2 - intermediate stenosis ( 25 % -75 % ) major branch and/or patient need conservative treatment ( need PTCA ) ; category 3 - severe stenosis ( &gt; 75 % ) major branch and/or patient need PTCA CABG . Statistical tool use detect correlation study marker extent atherosclerotic plaque . Subgroup analysis perform detect similar correlation certain risk group like smoker , obese subject , diabetes , subject hypercholesterolemia . Subjects contact year 5 year telephone information regard antiplatelet therapy cardiovascular event ( death , myocardial infarction , stent thrombosis , stroke , revascularization , major bleed ) collect .</detailed_description>
