	<brief_summary>This multicenter translational study understand therapeutic resistance patient undergo standard chemotherapy triple negative breast cancer . In neoadjuvant setting , biopsy tissue sample primary tumor collect banked start chemotherapy completion treatment ( post-chemotherapy time surgery ) . In metastatic setting , tissue sample metastatic lesion collect banked start chemotherapy time tumor progression . Additionally , blood sample draw treatment initiation ( baseline ) different time point treatment . All sample store Biological Resource Repository .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Identify Molecular Mechanisms Clinical Resistance Chemotherapy Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mechanisms resistance study many year various experimental model . However , many drug highly effective experimental model overcome resistance either ineffective marginally active preliminary clinical study . Thus decade study , review anti-cancer drug resistance still focus largely experimental model , may reflect resistance human . However , recent study demonstrate clinical resistance occur primary metastatic tumor may undergo significant molecular evolution due treatment effect selection clone recently show breast cancer . Triple negative breast cancer subtype carry poor prognosis high incidence early metastatic recurrence . Furthermore , target therapy efficacious subtype . Thus , identification mechanism resistance available therapy prediction tumoral response various treatment could help management patient affect particularly aggressive type breast cancer . The goal study two-fold . First , build biobank blood tissue specimen , prior start chemotherapy determine time-point ( surgery progression disease ) , patient undergo chemotherapeutic treatment neoadjuvant metastatic setting . Second , use cutting-edge molecular technique available several Quebec research center , carefully compare pre post treatment sample identify `` molecular factor resistance '' . The discovery factor help oncologist triaging patient receive beneficial therapy recognize give particular treatment essential reduce potential harmful side effect avoid extremely high cost modern treatment predict ineffective .</detailed_description>

Patients histologically confirm primary adenocarcinoma breast 2 . Metastatic ( stage IV ) disease initial diagnosis follow previous diagnosis primary breast cancer 3 . At least one metastatic site accessible biopsy . 4 . ERnegative , PgR negative HER2 negative per local standard 5 . Scheduled receive chemotherapy triple negative metastatic breast cancer . 6 . Measurable disease ( least one unidimensionally measurable lesion ) 7 . Normal coagulation profile ; include INR/ PTT ≤ 1.5 x ULN . 8 . ECOG 0,1 2 9 . Life expectancy 12 week . 10 . Provide write consent investigational nature , study design , risk benefit study explain . 11 . Able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement Neoadjuvant set 1 . Positive ER , PR Her2 define local standard 2 . Clinical radiological evidence metastatic disease 3 . Inadequate unusable tissue tissue available biopsy 4 . Other nonmalignant systemic disease preclude treatment chemotherapy regimen prevent followup 5 . Diagnosis inflammatory breast cancer 6 . Known infection HIV hepatitis Metastatic setting 1 . Patients ER+ , PR+ HER2+ tumor demonstrate local standard 2 . Inadequate unusable tissue tissue available biopsy 3 . Other nonmalignant systemic disease preclude treatment standard chemotherapy regimen prevent followup 4 . Abnormal coagulation profile 5 .
