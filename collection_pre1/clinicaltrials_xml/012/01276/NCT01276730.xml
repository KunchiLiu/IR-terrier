	<brief_summary>The study objective : - To evaluate response survival rate treat stage III cervical cancer retinoic acid interferon-α combined radiotherapy study group . - To evaluate response survival rate treat stage III cervical cancer patient concomitant cisplatin radiotherapy control group . - To evaluate safety tolerability combination retinoic acid , interferon-α radiation therapy compare concomitant chemo-radiation therapy . - To determine immune response Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) estimate serum IgG1 IgG2 antibodies E7 proteins HPV type 16 18 treatment . The study hypothesis : - The response rate survival rate retinoic acid interferon-α combination radiation well chemo-radiation treat stage III cervical cancer . - Treatment retinoic acid , interferon-α radiation combination therapy less toxic well tolerate chemo-radiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total 200 woman confirm diagnosis invasive cervical cancer , stage III , recruit study . The patient recruit Gynecologic Oncology Department Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute register 600 case cancer cervix per year . Computer-generated number randomize patient two treatment arm . This trial design treat stage III cervical cancer patient concomitant immunotherapy ( cis-retinoic acid interferon-α ) radiotherapy study arm . Cancer uterine cervix second common cancer among woman worldwide cause large number cancer-related death among woman develop country . In India , cervical cancer common cancer among woman ( 126,000 new case , 71,000 death 2000 ) , account quarter global burden cervical cancer ( 471,000 new case 233,000 death ) .1,2 In contrast , U.S. , although , 12,200 new case cervical cancer 4,100 death 2003 , United States spend $ 5 billion per year screen treat cervical cancer precancerous lesion . Advanced cervical cancer relatively rare develop world routine PAP testing . However , develop country like India , absence population base cervical cancer screen program ( HPV testing , PAP smear ) , nearly 80 % patient initially detect stage III high . Cisplatin-based chemotherapy administer along surgery radiation recommend treatment advanced cervical cancer US develop country .</detailed_description>
