	<brief_title>Study Use Low Level Laser Therapy Reduce Acne</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acne chronic inflammatory disorder plague sebaceous follicle , debate still remain truly initiate lesion formation . Experts agree increase androgen production play significant role onset acne . Androgens promote increase size sebaceous gland stimulate sebum production . The simple act sebaceous gland stimulation via androgen could ultimately promote upregulation pro-inflammatory cytokine like tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) interleukin ( IL-1α ) without propionibacteria even present . The synthesis IL-α pro-inflammatory cytokine include prostaglandin occurs via inducible enzyme know cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) . Studies analyze pathogenesis mucositis identify COX-2 important contributor upregulation pro-inflammatory cytokine thus major contributor progression disorder . Recent evidence indicate low-level laser therapy ( LLLT ) able significantly diminish expression COX-2 , result reduction inflammation . The ability modulate COX-2 pathway via LLLT believe inhibit production pro-inflammatory cytokine ( i.e . TNF-α IL- α ) present acne-prone skin .</detailed_description>
