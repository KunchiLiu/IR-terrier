	<brief_title>The Effect Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Insulin Sensitivity Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity become severe epidemic globally . With rapid increase obesity come pronounced rise obesity-related disorder , especially type 2 diabetes . Weight loss achieve lifestyle change improve diabetes , difficult maintain time . In contrast , Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) surgery induce long-term weight loss remission diabetes . Surprisingly , resolution type 2 diabetes occurs within day surgery significant weight loss . The resolution diabetes must therefore explained response surgical alteration stomach intestine : restriction gastric volume bypass stomach , duodenum proximal jejunum . Severe insulin resistance muscle liver common defect obesity type 2 diabetes may improve even reverse shortly operation . The aim study examine acute change insulin sensitivity muscle liver use hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp combine glucose tracer ass hepatic glucose production . Insulin signal pathway study biopsy muscle subcutaneous fat explain molecular basis change insulin sensitivity RYGB . Insulin secretion evaluate response oral glucose well iv glucose-glucagon .</detailed_description>
