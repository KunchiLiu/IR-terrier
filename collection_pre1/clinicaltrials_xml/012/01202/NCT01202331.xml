	<brief_summary>Mass antimicrobial administration remarkably successful reduce prevalence ocular strain Chlamydia cause trachoma . Repeated distribution progressively low prevalence infection , case may even result local elimination . Mass treatment continue forever , due concern cost antibiotic resistance . The hope measure latrine construction hygiene program would prevent infection return . Unfortunately , non-antibiotic measure yet demonstrate effect infection . 1 . We hypothesize Chlamydial infection return community treatment end . 2 . We hypothesize infection completely eliminate community treat seven year . 3 . We hypothesize identify treat clinically active case among preschool age child delay even prevent reemergence far low cost mass treatment individual .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study group-randomized trial determine frequency treatment target community-wide mass antibiotic treatment eliminate trachoma . We continue monitor sub-set community TANA study , Goncha Siso Enese district East Gojam Zone , Ethiopia . Here evaluate infection return antibiotic discontinue , whether infection predictably eliminate , whether infection prevent return target treatment strategy : Specific Aim 1 . To determine whether antibiotic stop 4 year . Specific Aim 2 . To determine whether infection completely eliminate mass treatment continue seven year . Specific Aim 3 . To determine whether treatment target pre-school aged child , household pre-school age child clinically active trachoma , prevent infection return community . Specific Aim 4 : To determine whether mass azithromycin distribution reduce visit local health clinic due cause infectious cause . Specific Aim 5 : To determine whether mass azithromycin distribution result good growth metric ( weight-for-height , height-for age , weight-for-age , middle upper arm circumference ) compare treatment . Specific Aim 6 : To determine whether under-5 mortality low community treat mass azithromycin compare treatment Specific Aim 7 : To determine whether macrolide resistance Streptococcus pneumoniae , Hameophilus influenzae , Staphylococcus aureus prevalent community treat biannual mass azithromycin compare community treat annual mass azithromycin , determine whether targeted azithromycin treatment result less macrolide resistance compare mass azithromycin distribution .</detailed_description>
