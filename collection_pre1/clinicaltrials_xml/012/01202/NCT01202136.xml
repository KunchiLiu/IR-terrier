	<brief_summary>The aim propose prospectively validate diagnostic approach model prediction mucinous versus non-mucinous , malignant versus non-malignant pancreatic cyst use combination clinical , radiologic , biomarker characteristic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Clinical , Radiologic , Pathologic Molecular Marker Characteristics Pancreatic Cysts Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This combine cross-sectional prospective single center clinical translational study involve collaborative multidisciplinary team compose gastroenterologist , surgeon , radiologist , basic scientist . Eligible patient solitary multiple pancreatic cyst refer diagnostic evaluation and/or surgical treatment undergo initial radiographic image high-resolution CT , MRI/MRCP , EUS/FNA part standard medical care Johns Hopkins Hospital . This three-phase study . In Phase I , eligible patient pancreatic cyst undergo initial radiographic imaging ( high-resolution CT , MRI/MRCP , endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) ) part standard care Johns Hopkins Hospital . Patients categorize accord presence symptom referable cyst image feature concern malignancy base initial radiographic assessment . Symptomatic patient , concern feature , refer surgical resection . The pathologic feature final diagnosis resect pancreatic cyst compare preoperative clinical , radiologic , cyst fluid test result . Asymptomatic patient low-risk feature baseline radiographic endoscopic image enter Phase II . Patients follow prospective periodic surveillance schedule accord consensus clinical guideline either CT MRI monitor new metachronous cystic neoplasm . Those develop symptom concern feature repeat EUS/FNA well image opposite axial imaging modality , refer surgery suspicious lesion detect . Patients surgery either Phase I Phase II , enter post-surgical surveillance ( Phase III ) . Patients follow use prospective periodic surveillance schedule accord consensus clinical guideline either CT MRI monitor new metachronous cystic neoplasm . Those undergo surgery surveillance Phase II continue image modality originally evaluate prior surgery.. Patients develop symptom high-risk feature image repeat EUS/FNA well image opposite axial imaging modality refer surgery suspicious lesion detect . Samples collect prospectively biomarker analysis . Cyst fluid , pancreatic juice blood collect EUS blood collect yearly outpatient clinic visit . Patients follow three year .</detailed_description>
