	<brief_summary>This study design assess impact exercise supplementation measure fitness , function , cardiovascular disease risk factors/modifiers individual spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . The primary purpose study improve fitness function , reduce cardiovascular disease risk , enhance oxidation dietary body fat persons chronic tetraplegia acute exercise , exercise conditioning , dietary supplementation . This study test hypothesis time supplementation regard exercise bout ( 'intervention/placebo ' ) affect fitness , function , lipid profile , lipid oxidation , inflammatory marker acute exercise chronic conditioning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Much general population , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death person spinal cord injury . However , CVD occur early life SCI , progress silently , manifest atypical symptom fail warn impend ischemic damage . This accelerate development CVD multimodal cause , include , limited : sedentary lifestyle , decreased muscle mass , increase fat mass , physiologic alteration lipid metabolism , attributable part SCI . Traditional method dietary modification exercise intervention likely insufficient elicit adequate modification post-SCI physiology prevent CVD . Secondary purpose , immediate importance individual SCI impact sedentary lifestyle increase obesity ability remain independent . A quarter young person SCI posse level fitness inadequate complete essential activity daily live . Thus , sedentary lifestyle , measure fitness , correlate perceptive morbidity mortality person SCI . Atherosclerosis recently define inflammatory disease . C-reactive protein emerge general marker inflammation elevate person SCI . We demonstrate person SCI pathophysiologic lipid uptake response high fat meal , endpoint increase vascular oxidative stress , precursor CVD , indexed endothelial microparticles . We also demonstrate circuit resistance training favorably alters lipid profile person paraplegia . Research able-bodied individual suggest acute bout exercise accelerate postprandial lipid metabolism ( PPL ) . Post-exercise supplementation demonstrate improve gain lean muscle mass performance exercise alone able-bodied individual spinal cord injury . Targeting inflammation , post-prandial lipidemia , alter lipid profile dietary exercise intervention may method reverse pre-empt development CVD person SCI . Increasing muscle mass physical performance intervention may improve physical performance thus independence activity daily live person SCI . In addition , exercise may serve decrease depression anxiety person SCI , much non-disabled person . Targeted exercise plus timed supplementation may decrease accelerated morbidity mortality person SCI .</detailed_description>
