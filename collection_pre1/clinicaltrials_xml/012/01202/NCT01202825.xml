	<detailed_description>TMC647055 investigate treatment chronic hepatitis C infection . This first-in-human , double-blind ( sponsor , investigator participant know treatment give ) , randomize ( like flip coin ) , placebo-controlled , single centre , Phase I study healthy volunteer examine safety , tolerability , plasma pharmacokinetics increase single oral dos increase repeated oral dos TMC647055 , follow double-blind repeated-dose part chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infect patient . The study population consist 45 healthy adult volunteer 18 55 year age 10 20 chronic HCV-genotype 1 infected patient 18 65 year age . The single dose escalation part trial include 2 panel ( Panels 1 2 ) 9 participant . There 6 session ( Sessions I VI ) : panel 1 session I , III &amp; V ; panel 2 session II , IV VI . In session , 6 participant receive TMC647055 3 participant receive placebo standard meal . Over 3 session , participant receive TMC647055 twice placebo . The dose TMC647055 consecutively increase . Planned dose 100 mg , 250 mg , 600 mg , 1250 mg , 2000 mg , 3000 mg TMC647055 placebo , administer single oral administration . A wash period least 10 day respect 2 session 1 panel . Doses may adapt pending safety pharmacokinetic outcome previous session exceed limit 3000 mg . Dose increase occur previous dose show generally safe tolerable . For precautionary safety reason , dose administration session IV , V VI stagger : first 4 5 participant panel receive dose least 24 hour prior second group 4 5 participant . To investigate effect food , one single dose test fasted condition ( Session VII ) . The dose TMC647055 test session derive result obtain Sessions I V. Participants receive TMC647055 select dose standard meal Sessions I V receive TMC647055 fast condition Session VII . Participants receive placebo receive placebo . The multiple-dose escalation part trial ( session VIII , IX X ) include 3 panel ( Panels 3 , 4 , 5 ) 9 participant : panel 3 session VIII , panel 4 session IX panel 5 session X . In panel , TMC647055 placebo administer 6 consecutive day , Day 6 morning dose . Medication anticipate give either every 8 hour , every 12 hour every 24 hour . This change per dose session follow outcome previous session . In multiple dosing session , 6 participant receive TMC647055 3 participant receive placebo . The multiple dose escalation part start dos Sessions I , II , III , IV find generally safe tolerable base upon review blind safety pharmacokinetic data . Dose increase occur previous dose show generally safe tolerable . The initial daily dose test Panel 3 high dos test Sessions I IV . After healthy volunteer session , 3 session chronic HCV infect patient ( session XI , XII XIII ) . Session XI start dos healthy volunteer find generally safe tolerable select dose give every 12 hour . The total daily dose exceed high daily dose exposure show generally safe multiple dose escalation healthy volunteer . The dose session XII select base result session XI give every 12 hour every 8 hour . In session , 8 patient receive TMC647055 2 patient receive placebo . TMC647055 give 6 consecutive day day 6 morning dose . Session XIII open-label consist 2 treatment arm . In treatment arm 1 , 8 patient receive TMC647055 ( 1000 mg twice day ) co-administered TMC435 ( 150 mg daily ) 10 days.In treatment arm 2 , 8 subject receive TMC435 ( 150 mg daily ) 6 day . Safety tolerability evaluate continuously check illness side effect , take blood urine sample , electrocardiogram telemetry ( electrical record heart , healthy volunteer ) , take blood pressure heart rate perform physical examination . TMC647055 placebo give oral solution , range 100 3000 mg single dose part , multiple dose part 6 consecutive day either every 8 hour , 12 hour 24 hour . In session XI XII , TMC647055 placebo give every 8 12 hour dose frequency determine result previous session . In session XIII , dose TMC647055 1000 mg twice day TMC435 give oral capsule 150 mg daily .</detailed_description>
