	<brief_summary>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) common cause progressive cognitive decline United States . AD characterize severe impairment learn , memory cognitive ability significantly interfere daily functioning . The neuropathologic hallmark AD consist neuritic plaque , neurofibrillary tangle , selective neuronal cell loss . Amyloid plaque , contain Abeta protein , believe play integral role development AD . Elevated level Abeta brain also correlate cognitive decline . Alzheimer 's ( AD ) develop insidiously , make difficult identify early , yet treatment effective begin early stage disease . Thus , become important researcher identify marker early AD . This project examine relationship four potential marker may indicate early development AD : 1 . Mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) normal cognition 2 . Practice effect 3 . Amyloid plaque bind 18F-PIB PET 4 . Glucose hypometabolism FDG PET This project recruit 25 subject ongoing community-based study memory practice effect cognitively normal , community-dwelling individual age 65 ( NIA # 5K23AG028417-05 ) . Each subject undergo positron emission tomography ( PET ) 18F-Flutemetamol FDG . The overall objective companion project study biodistribution bind 18F-Flutemetamol subject use PET imaging , provide biological evidence support overall hypothesis failure benefit practice learn paradigm early marker AD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall objective companion study project study biodistribution bind 18F-Flutemetamol use PET image community-dwelling functionally intact elderly subject . Understanding biodistribution bind radiopharmaceutical normal patient various level potential cognitive decline help determine appropriate role disease biomarker aid interpretation image produce agent . Comparison FDG-PET essential correlate metabolic change anatomic co-registration 18F-PIB image necessary group analysis . We use 18F-Flutemetamol FDG-PET compare subject low high practice effect follow aims hypothesis : Specific Aim 1 : Examine relationship practice effect amyloid burden community sample . Specific Aim 2 : Determine whether FDG-PET 18F-Flutemetamol well distinguish individual high low practice effect . Hypothesis 1 : Practice effect negatively correlate amyloid deposition , high level practice effect ( i.e. , good repeat test ) associate low level brain amyloid deposition low level practice effect ( i.e. , poor repeat test ) associate great level brain amyloid two group clearly distinguishable 18F-PIB FDG-PET . Hypothesis 2 : Patients increase amyloid deposition show 18F-PIB FDG-PET scan pronounce temporal parietal hypometabolism note visual review image statistical image analysis .</detailed_description>
