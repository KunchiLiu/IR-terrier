	<detailed_description>Objective : To investigate effect treatment CSF : A placebo control double blind crossover study . Design : Crossover Randomized Control Trial Setting : Academically affiliated private infertility center Subjects : Female IVF patient age willing randomized treatment , either IVF treatment , frozen embryo cycle ( FET ) donor IVF cycle ( D-IVF ) , 5 day ET , inadequate endometrial thickness . Interventions : Subjects receive transvaginally , utilize insemination catheter , 2 slow intrauterine lavages CSF-1 ( Neupogen generic , 300ug 1 ml ) 5 3 day , respectively , embryo transfer control receive 1 ml saline instead . Patients become pregnant one month washout time continue treatment opposite study arm choose remain embryo . Main Outcome Measures : Number patient reach embryo transfer adequate endometrial thickness least 7mm . Second Outcome Measures : Implantation pregnancy rates.. Statistical Power consideration : This Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) two study arm pan crossover . Patients randomly assign Study group A B accord computer generate randomization table 50:50 distribution . The study test null hypothesis difference transfer rate two group . Transfer possible endometrial thickness reach 7 mm . Order treatment ab v ba add model separate factor phase analyze separate treatment stratum . The investigator plan study independent case control 1 control per case . Prior data indicate transfer rate among control &lt; 1 % . If true transfer rate experimental subject 25 % , investigator need study 38 experimental subject 38 control subject able reject null hypothesis transfer rate experimental control subject equal probability ( power ) 0.8 . The Type I error probability associate test null hypothesis 0.05 . We use continuity-corrected chi-squared statistic Fisher 's exact test evaluate null hypothesis . There plan interim analysis 20 participant complete trial significant effect observe trial may terminate time . The power detect difference interim analysis 42.6 % .</detailed_description>
