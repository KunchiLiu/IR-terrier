	<brief_title>An Observational Safety Evaluation Patients Treated With NEVO™ Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent . ( NEVO II )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Restenosis remain frequent cause late failure initially successful coronary angioplasty occur many 20-40 % procedure perform . Loss luminal diameter result restenosis attribute three physiologic mechanism : passive elastic recoil vessel , geometric vessel remodel neointimal hyperplasia . Coronary stent provide mechanical scaffolding reduces restenosis limit extent elastic recoil late vascular remodel . Despite improvement , incidence restenosis follow coronary stent implantation occur 20-40 % case . Restenosis follow stenting primarily result neointimal hyperplasia . The methodology interventional cardiology historically evolve diagnostic coronary angiography balloon angioplasty , use bare metal stent , refinement drug-eluting stent durable polymer , verge drug-eluting stent develop drug delivery approach reservoir technology use bioresorbable polymer . While reservoir approach may make drug delivery controllable , reduction polymer exposure vessel wall design improve vascular healing reduce occurrence undesirable side effect stent thrombosis especially long-term drug completely elute . While date , concept validate preferably pre-clinical study , limited clinical data available suggest efficacy safety NEVO™ SES , study seek assess clinical value large unselected cohort subject represent real-world contemporary treatment pattern non-inferiority comparison widely use DES today , XIENCE V® / XIENCE PRIME™ / PROMUS® stent . Between August October 2010 , 156 subject enrol trial . Of 156 subject , 103 treat NEVO™ Sirolimus-eluting Stent 53 comparator . Based small number acute performance observation , Cordis voluntary suspend enrollment optimize balloon catheter . As result evolve market dynamic , product portfolio decision , Cordis decide June 2011 long pursue development NEVO™ Sirolimus-eluting coronary stent . As result decision , design objective NEVO II trial change allow follow-up 103 NEVO™ subject . Since NEVO™ SES investigational device ; NEVO™ subject followed-up safeguard safety wellbeing . The 53 subject comparator arm need follow-up due fact treat commercially available stent .</detailed_description>
