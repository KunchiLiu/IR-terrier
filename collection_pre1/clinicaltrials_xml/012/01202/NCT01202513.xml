	<detailed_description>Vitiligo acquire depigmentation disorder great cosmetic importance , affect 1-4 % world 's population . Vitiligo cause physical symptom unsightly appearance , particularly dark tan skin considerable impact psychologically socially . Many way restore normal colour skin try improvement usually short-lived . The cause vitiligo yet clearly understood , many treatment develop basis limit scientific evidence . There cure , way limit spread disease far find . The pathogenetic basis disease melanocyte disappearance achromic patch experimental evidence show three possible mechanism enable occur : apoptotic process , necrotic event , melanocythoragy follow trauma due impaired function cell-cell cell-matrix adhesion . Prostaglandins ( PGs ) biologically active derivative 20 carbon atom polyunsaturated essential fatty acid release cell membrane phospholipid . PGE2 PGF2 primary PGs . PGE2 synthesize skin affect keratinocytes , Langerhans cell melanocytes regulates melanocyte proliferation . Epidermal melanocyte synthesize melanin response ultraviolet radiation ( UVR ) . The mechanisms mediate UVR-induced activation melanogenesis unknown , UVR induce turnover membrane phospholipid generate prostaglandin ( PGs ) product , possible one might provide activate signal . 1 In vitro study Tomita et al .,2 normal human epidermal melanocyte become swollen dendritic culture prostaglandin E 2 ( PGE 2 ) , PGE 1 . In another study Nordlund et al . , 3 PGE2 apply topically mice skin cause increase melanocyte density . Histologic study indicate PGE 2 also enhance melanogenesis . Recently , many report iris darken , hyperpigmentation eyelash , periocular hyperpigmentation induce latanoprost . ( prostaglandin F 2 Î± , use treatment glaucoma ) . 4,5 Although exact mechanism pigmentation clear , different mechanism induction hyperpigmentation prostaglandin suggest , include : ( ) influence responsiveness melanocyte neuronal stimulus ; ( ii ) cause melanocyte proliferation ; ( iii ) direct second messenger mediate interaction melanocyte via stimulation tyrosinase activity . Phototherapy topical agent corticosteroid , calcineurin inhibitor , vitamin-D derivative basic treatment modality use vitiligo still effective safe treatment disease . Resistance therapy , treatment complication recurrence treatment major problem current treatment . There clinical study use Bimatoprost 0.03 % treatment vitiligo , suppose cause hyperpigmentation hypertrichosis compare topical prostaglandin analogue , hence , decide use treatment localize vitiligo . Aim : In study , twenty patient vitiligo treated topical Bimatoprost o.o3 % ophthalmic solution 4 month elucidate efficacy tolerability stable vitiligo . Patients method In prospective , interventional , non-randomised , single blind , control study , twenty patient stable vitiligo enrol Dermatology patient department Gian Sagar Medical College Hospital . The protocol follow Declaration Helsinki prior approval Institutional Review Board obtain . Informed consent obtain patient . Detailed history physical examination obtain . The age , sex , previous treatment , family history , type vitiligo , duration disease ( month ) , area involvement , Koebner phenomenon , leukotrichia record special data sheet . The diagnosis vitiligo make clinically . No concomitant treatment allow washout period least 1 month give patient use therapy . Patients instruct apply Bimatoprost 0.03 % solution twice daily depigmented skin take care spillage surround skin . The dimension treat lesion measure transverse longitudinal ax time enrollment , subsequently every month till 4 month . The measurement lesion perform independent observer blind treatment option . Photography do use digital camera ( Sony Digital Still Camera Cyber-shot ModelNO DSCF 717 , Tokyo , Japan ) baseline every follow visit . Patients evaluate observer blind treatment option . Primary Outcome Measures : The percentage repigmentation previously depigmented patch , form color size change folliculocentric repigmentation , treat control patches.6 Depending extent repigmentation , response treatment grade : - minimal ( &lt; 25 % ) , - moderate ( 25-49 % ) , - mark ( 50-74 % ) , - excellent ( 75-99 % ) , - complete ( 100 % ) response . Response without reduction surface perifollicular hyperpigmentation categorize perifollicular pigmentation . Responding lesion define patch achieve 50 % repigmentation compare baseline . Treatment discontinue patient show improvement worsen 2 month .</detailed_description>
