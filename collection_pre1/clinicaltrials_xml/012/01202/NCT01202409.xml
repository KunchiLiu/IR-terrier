	<brief_title>CAPOX KRAS Wild-Type Advanced Adenocarcinoma Small Bowel Ampulla Vater</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Panitumumab design `` turn '' protein important cell growth . This may stop growth cancer cell . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive study drug 14 day study `` cycle . '' On Day 1 every cycle , receive panitumumab vein 60-90 minute . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam , include measurement weight . - Your performance status record . - You ask symptom may experience drug may take . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Every 4 cycle : - You chest X-ray compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest check status disease . - You CT MRI scan check status disease . If scan show respond treatment , another CT MRI scan 6 week later . Length Study : You may continue receive study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . End-of-Treatment : After stop taking study drug reason , end-of-treatment visit . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight . - Your performance status record . - You ask symptom may experience drug may take . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , CT MRI scan abdomen pelvis check status disease . Follow-Up : Thirty ( 30 ) day last dose study drug ( ) , ask symptom may experience drug may take . If unable come MD Anderson , study staff call ask question . This call last 30 minute . You call every 3 month ask question . Each call last 15-30 minute . If take study treatment reason disease get bad , CT MRI scan abdomen pelvis check status disease every 12 week ( +/- 2 week ) End-of-Treatment visit . This do disease get bad start anti-cancer treatment . This investigational study . Panitumumab commercially available FDA approve treat certain type colorectal cancer . Its use type cancer investigational . Up 27 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically confirm adenocarcinoma small bowel ampulla Vater either unresectable metastatic . 2 . Adequate tumor tissue available KRAS mutational analysis know KRAS wildtype status . 3 . Prior progression intolerance treatment fluoropyrimidine oxaliplatin . Recurrence disease within 6 month completion adjuvant therapy fluoropyrimidine oxaliplatin consider progression . 4 . Patients must measurable disease per revise Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion ( Version 1.1 ) . 5 . If radiation previously receive , measurable disease must outside previous radiation field , unless area demonstrate evidence radiographic growth . 6 . A minimum 2 week must elapse completion prior chemotherapy radiotherapy surgery start date study therapy . 7 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 2 . 8 . Adequate organ function include : ) Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) =/ &gt; 1,000/ul ; b ) Platelets =/ &gt; 75,000/ul ; c ) Total bilirubin =/ &lt; 1.5 x ULN ; patient know Gilbert 's syndrome direct bilirubin =/ &lt; 1.5 x ULN use organ function criterion , instead total bilirubin ; ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 3 x ULN ; e ) Creatinine &lt; 2 x ULN . 9 . Negative urine serum pregnancy test woman childbearing potential ( define postmenopausal 12 month previous surgical sterilization ) , within one week prior initiation treatment . 10 . The effect panitumumab develop fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry , duration study participation , six month follow completion therapy . Should woman become pregnant participate study , inform treat physician immediately . 11 . Patients must sign Informed Consent Authorization indicate aware investigational nature study know risk involve . 12 . Magnesium level =/ &gt; low limit normal . 1 . Prior antiepidermal growth factor receptor antibody therapy ( eg . panitumumab cetuximab ) prior small molecule antiepidermal growth factor receptor therapy ( eg . erlotinib ) adenocarcinoma small bowel ampulla Vater . 2 . Patients may receive investigational agent receive investigational drug 30 day prior enrollment . 3 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit adherence study requirement . 4 . Interstitial pneumonia extensive symptomatic interstitial fibrosis lung . 5 . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother panitumumab , breast feeding must discontinue . 6 . Age &lt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use panitumumab patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study .</criteria>
