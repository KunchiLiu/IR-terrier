	<brief_summary>Camptothecins potent class anticancer drug inhibit DNA Topoisomerase I . While see strictly cytotoxic compound , camptothecins actually also targeted agent , inhibit DNA-Topoisomerase I ( Topo I ) cleavable complex . First second generation cogeners hamper labile α-hydroxy-δ-lactone pharmacophore , hydrolyzes yield inactive carboxylate form drug . AR-67 ( 7-t-butyldimethylsilyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin ) third generation analog engineer stable blood highly potent . Its enhanced stability result two factor : ( 1 ) AR-67 highly lipophilic , partition lipid bilayers , thus protect hydrolysis aqueous milieu bloodstream , ( 2 ) 10-hydroxy functionality drug effectively ablate high affinity interaction carboxylate drug form albumin , previously show diminish level active lactone specie circulation . In recently complete phase I trial , AR-67 show 85 % lactone stability time point study , well-tolerated grade 4 thrombocytopenia , neutropenic fever grade 3 fatigue dose limit toxicity . The MTD establish 7.5 mg/m2/day daily time five 21 day cycle . Preclinical data indicate AR-67 may concentrate tumor prolonged period time , compare plasma clearance drug , phenomenon potential improve efficacy decrease toxicity compound . What known optimal dose schedule AR-67 need produce high tumor penetration , modest systemic exposure . This pilot proposal seek study AR-67 novel dosing schedule evaluate feasibility perform tumor biopsy determine tumor half-life AR-67 human . By use multiple tumor biopsy , mean document penetration tumor tissue AR-67 , compare plasma clearance drug , investigator establish direct pharmacokinetic evidence AR-67 `` hit target '' . The investigator propose rigorous evaluation drug penetration tumor consider , addition MTD , determine dose new experimental compound . Dose-tumor concentration relationship establish early course clinical development provide data rational selection phase-II dose . This pilot study provide important preliminary data establish feasibility approach future study . If successful , tumor half life use develop optimal biologic dose phase I trial use schedule AR-67 . Optimal biologic dosing could become new standard dose escalation study compound cytotoxic drug specific biologic target future .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must 18 year age great histologically cytologically proven solid malignancy metastatic unresectable standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . Patients recur previous surgery and/or radiation may participate trial , although restriction place number prior therapy . Patients must willing able two coreneedle biopsy tumor participate trial . Patients know brain metastasis eligible clinical trial disease treat clinically stable ( base assessment treat physician ) document stable improved pretreatment CT MRI scan brain evaluate CNS disease within 28 day prior registration . Patients may measurable OR nonmeasurable disease document CT , MRI , Xray nuclear exam ( FDGPET ) . All disease must assess within 28 day prior registration . Pleural effusion , ascites laboratory parameter acceptable evidence measurable disease . Patients must progress least one prior chemotherapy candidate salvage surgery . Prior biologic therapy prior radiation permit ; however , least two week must elapse since completion prior therapy patient must recover associated toxicity ( due prior therapy ) time registration . At least three week must elapse since surgery ( thoracic major surgery ) patient must recover associated toxicity time registration . Patients must acceptable organ marrow function document within seven day registration define : Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional ULN Creatinine within normal institutional limit , OR Creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status &lt; 2 . No prior malignancy allow except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , adequately treated Stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission cancer patient diseasefree 3 year . Pregnant nursing woman may participate trial increase risk fetal harm include fetal death chemotherapeutic agent . In order participate trial , woman / men reproductive potential must agree use effective contraceptive method ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test document within seven day registration . Patients must inform investigational nature study must sign provide write informed consent accordance institutional federal guideline . Patients must life expectancy great 12 week . Eligibility patient receive medication substance know affect potential affect activity pharmacokinetics AR67 determine follow review case Principal Investigator . Efforts make switch patient take drug strong inducer enzyme CYP3A4 include anticonvulsant ( i.e. , phenytoin , phenobarbital , carbamazepine , primidone ) rifampin OR strong inhibitor CYP3A4 ( clarithromycin , itraconazole , ketoconazole ) appropriate medication Patients must chemotherapy radiotherapy within 3 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study . Patients may receive investigational agent . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . History ≥ Grade 3 allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition AR67 ( i.e . camptothecins irinotecan , topotecan others class pharmaceutical ) . Patients prior anaphylactic injection reaction &gt; Grade 3 paclitaxel product formulate Cremophor . Pregnant woman exclude study AR67 camptothecin potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother AR67 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated AR67 . HIVassociated symptom may preclude accurate assessment toxicity response treatment primary endpoint Phase I trial toxicity , patient HIV disease ineligible participation . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction AR67 . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy ineligible enrollment study . Subjects leukemia primary brain tumor exclude study . Subjects may receive follow medication two week prior , two week initiation AR67 : aprepitant , atazanavir , bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccine , carbamazepine , citalopram , ketoconazole , intraconazole , measles virus vaccine , mumps virus vaccine , phenobarbital , phenytoin , poliovirus vaccine , rifabutin , rifampin , rotavirus vaccine , rubella virus vaccine , smallpox vaccine , St John 's wort , typhoid vaccine , varicella virus vaccine yellow fever vaccine .</criteria>
