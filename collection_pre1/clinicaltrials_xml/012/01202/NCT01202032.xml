	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint occurrence limit toxicity lead definitive discontinuation study drug first 24 week absence progression disease . Secondary endpoint include occurrence Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) evaluate first two cycle ; overall response rate ( ORR ) , 6-months progression-free survival rate Pharmacokinetic assessment . The following definition use : DLT : The Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ) define occurrence first two cycle grade 4 toxicity , follow event : - clinical evidence congestive heart failure , - arterial thromboembolic event , - grade 3 venous thrombosis , - grade 3 thrombocytopenia &gt; =7 day associate bleeding , - grade 3 hypertension uncontrolled ( &gt; =160/90 mmHg ) medication , - grade 3 elevation AST/ALT total bilirubin . Any grade 3 toxicity &gt; =7 day also consider DLT , exception fatigue . MTD : The determination maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) conduct 3 + 3 + 3 design . Cohorts 3 9 patient sequentially enrol 3 step receive one four escalated dos Pazopanib combination Bevacizumab establish MTD ( step 1 : patient 1 3 ; step 2 : patient 4 6 ; step 3 : patient 7 9 ) . The MTD consider exceed DLT observe first 2 cycle ( i.e. , 56 day ) least 2 3 3 6 patient evaluable MTD two first step , least 3 9 patient completion enrolment ( step 3 ) . When MTD establish , patient already involve follow-up phase dose level MTD decrease MTD . Note : exploratory way ( i.e. , simulation ) possibility take account determination MTD occurrence recurrent grade 2 event combination synergic grade 2-3 toxicity `` 1/2 DLT '' investigate study . Optimal Long Exposure Dose ( OLED ) : To determine Optimal Long Exposure Dose ( OLED ) , patient experience Dose Limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) first two cycle continue treatment follow week 24 , order record toxic reaction lesser severity mixed toxicity lead definitive discontinuation study drug , absence progression disease . The OLED define dose level ( less equal MTD ) occurrence sub-acute limiting toxicity lead definitive discontinuation study drug compatible phase II study . In practice , &lt; =2/7-8 patient &lt; =3/9 patient treat dose level &lt; =MTD follow week 24 experience sub-acute limiting toxicity , dose level consider OLED . ORR : The overall response rate ( ORR ) define proportion patient complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) - target lesion tumor response accord RECIST guideline . Progression-Free Survival ( PFS ) : Progression-free survival ( PFS ) define time date first study drug administration date first observation document disease progression death due cause . PFS determine base tumor assessment ( RECIST criterion ) survival information .</detailed_description>
