	<brief_title>Strategy Recognize Initiate Treatment Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure emerge epidemic especially elderly , high mortality rate , substantial loss quality life , high healthcare cost , mainly due hospitalization . The majority ( usually elderly ) patient heart failure diagnose manage primary care . However underdiagnosis undertreatment patient heart failure primary care common . Implementation standardize diagnostic protocol together educate general practitioner pragmatic treatment strategy focus lay uptitration heartfailure medication , would fill gap underdiagnosis undertreatment nowadays exist primary care . All participant undergo standardize diagnostic work-up establish rule heart failure . In participant abnormal ECG and/or elevate natriuretic peptide level additional echocardiography perform outpatient clinic Diakonessenhuis Zeist . The definite diagnosis heart failure ( 'systolic ' 'diastolic ' ) establish expert panel consist two cardiologist general practitioner . The panel apply criterion update heart failure guideline ( 2008 ) European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) . Patients heart failure subsequently treat general practitioner . The participate general practitioner randomly divide either care usual ( control group ) special uptitration ( intervention group ) . Both group use medication recommend Dutch heart failure standard . However , general practitioner intervention group especially trained practical appliance guideline : initiation diuretic ACE-inhibitors structured uptitration ACE-inhibitors beta-blockers . In training , practical example use concern barrier general practitioner encounter use medication . In intervention group , patient 'systolic ' heart failure receive recommend maximal dose high tolerate dose . Patients 'diastolic ' heart failure receive optimal blood pressure heart rate control prefer cardiovascular drug . At baseline six month heart failure establish rule , participant ask perform six-minute walk test fill quality life questionnaire . During six month , participant heart failure additionally fill one questionnaire every three week . Also six month , electronical file general practitioner scrutinize ass ( dosage ) prescribe medication visit general practice cardiology department .</detailed_description>
