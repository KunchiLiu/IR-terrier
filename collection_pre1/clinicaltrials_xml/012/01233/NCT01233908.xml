	<brief_title>Diagnosis Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Following Primary Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment ( RRD ) potentially blind condition common cause ocular morbidity , estimate incidence 6.3-17.9 per 100,000 population . 1 Despite contemporary surgical treatment , nearly 95 % anatomical success , functional result repair primary RRD remain poor , 43 % achieve final vision ≥ 20/40 21 % visual acuity ( VA ) &lt; 20/100 . 2 Various study vision relate quality life RRD demonstrate RRD subject suffer substantial impairment physical , psychological social function . 3-6 Mozaffarieh et al . demonstrated subject suffer anxiety depression , correlation visual functional status . 7 However , date , study assess occurrence primary RRD traumatic event may trigger associated distress disorder . Post traumatic distress disorder ( PTSD ) diagnose subject exposed extreme stressor traumatic event , result response fear , helplessness , horror , cause typical symptom reexperiencing event , avoidance reminder event , increase arousal , least one month ( Table 1 ) . 8 PTSD find occur aftermath external trauma , rape , physical assault , combat natural disaster . 9 However , various illness describe well , trigger event , PTSD develop : myocardial infarction ( MI ) , 10 abortion , 11 , 12 cancer , 13 diagnosis HIV infection , 14 pulmonary disease . 15 , 16 The burden PTSD high , inability work return prior level function . 17 , 18 The work impairment associate PTSD estimate result annual productivity loss excess $ 3 billion US . 19 Furthermore , PTSD find impact physical health , high rate cardiovascular pulmonary illness , 20 great utilization health care service , 21 together put disorder major public health problem . The purpose study examine whether occurrence primary RRD give rise associate PTSD , investigate prevalence determine variable associate disorder . Methods : We approach 547 patient previous primary RRD , 363 ( mean age 58 ± 15 year , 64 % men ) enrol study . PTSD assess Clinician Administered PTSD Scale 25-Item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire ( NEI-VFQ-25 ) use measure vision-related quality life . Objective clinical measure obtain patient 's medical record . Psychological ophthalmological variable compare PTSD diagnose patient subset PTSD-negative patient , serve control .</detailed_description>
