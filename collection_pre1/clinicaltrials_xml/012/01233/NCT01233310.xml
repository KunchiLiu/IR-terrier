	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis : It estimate re-programming PillCam COLON2 system parameter serve tool visualize small bowel colon . As , system may utilize CD patient monitor mucosal healing . Primary objective : To evaluate two different video output method visualization SB colon CD patient Secondary objective : - Evaluate level agreement PillCam system ileocolonoscopy assessment CD finding . - Evaluate effectiveness PillCam regimen CD patient Inclusion criterion - Patient 18 year age - Patient diagnosis ileocolonic colonic Crohn 's Disease document endoscopical , histopathological and/or radiological parameter - Patients ' CDAI &gt; 150 . - Patient clinically indicate undergo ileocolonoscopy assessment Crohn 's disease - Proven patency Agile capsule another approach deem clinically acceptable investigator , e.g . CT enterography , perform within 3 month prior enrollment - Patient able agree sign Informed Consent Form Exclusion criterion - Patient dysphagia - Patient congestive heart failure - Patient renal insufficiency - Patient cirrhosis - Patient know suspected suffer intestinal obstruction - Patient know previous stricture/obstruction SB colon - Patient take NSAID medication less one month enrollment - Patient suffers hypertension take one follow medication use control hypertension : diuretic , ACE inhibitor , Angiotensin II blocker - Chronic use laxatives - Patient cardiac pacemaker implant electro medical device . - Women either pregnant nursing time screening , intend study period , child-bearing potential practice medically acceptable method contraception . - Patient expect undergo MRI examination within 7 day ingestion capsule . - Patient prior abdominal surgery gastrointestinal tract uncomplicated procedure would unlikely lead bowel obstruction base clinical judgment investigator . - Patient condition , preclude compliance study and/or device instruction . - Patient suffers life threaten condition - Patient currently participate another clinical study - Patient know slow gastric empty time - Patient allergic contraindicate study medication</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : Multi-center , prospective study Number subject : Up 30 study duration : 18 month Subject population : Subjects moderate severe Crohn 's disease demonstrate colon involvement indicate undergo standard ileocolonoscopy part disease management Study Design : 1 . Each patient undergo PillCam , procedure follow conventional ileocolonoscopy procedure intubation terminal ileum 2 . During ileocolonoscopy procedure , colonoscopist document finding accord parameter define SES-CD score overall assessment follow segment : 1 . Rectum 2 . Left colon ( include sigmoid ) 3 . Transverse colon 4 . Right colon 5 . Terminal ileum 3 . Cleansing level ileocolonoscopy procedure assess site 4 . From capsule endoscopy procedure two RAPID video version generate segmented segment 5 . A committee compose study investigator review RAPID video segment document finding accord parameter define SES-CD , Lewis CECDAI score system overall assessment 6 . The parameter segment per two RAPID movie compare preferable video setup choose 7 . Final RAPID colonoscopy movie de-identified regard patient site identity 8 . The preferable full RAPID version review investigator document finding accord parameter define SES-CD score system overall assessment 9. cleanse level capsule procedure ass The evaluation per subject within 24 end rocedure .</detailed_description>
