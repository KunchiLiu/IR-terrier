	<detailed_description>Cholera re-emerging infectious disease cause significant morbidity mortality population lack access safe drinking water sanitation . Provision safe drinking water food , establishment adequate sanitation , implementation personal community hygiene constitute main public health intervention cholera . These measure implement fully near future cholera-endemic area . Improvements water sanitation require substantial long-term investment , commitment local government often take year implement . In meantime , safe , effective , affordable vaccine would useful tool cholera prevention control . Considerable progress make last decade development new generation oral cholera vaccine cholera . A monovalent ( anti-O1 ) WC-rBS oral kill cholera vaccine B-subunit develop Professor Jan Holmgren Sweden sell primarily traveler 's vaccine ; WHO pre-qualified vaccine till date . A version vaccine lack B subunit considerably less expensive produce ( `` whole-cell '' ) bivalent ( O1 O139 ) , produce use exclusively Vietnam , make first oral cholera vaccine use primarily endemic population . To internationalize use improved vaccine , production technology modify comply WHO Manufacturing practice ( cGMP ) standard manufacture technology transfer Indian manufacturing company Shantha Biotechnics Limited International Vaccine Institute . The modify kill bivalent oral cholera vaccine recently license Drugs Controller General India ( DCGI ) Shantha Biotechnics Limited market Shancol ® phase II Phase III clinical trial . It administer orally 2 liquid dos ( without need buffer solution ) 14 day individual age 1 year . It find safe , effective provide 67 % protection two year placebo-controlled , randomized trial Kolkata , India . Despite recent licensure , remain question need answer would vital deploy vaccine include optimization dose regimen . A previous study perform Kolkata reveal two dos vaccine give 14 day apart result high immune response first dose , contrary early finding Swedish vaccine . This new finding may due high lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) content modify vaccine may elicit sufficient immune response effectively block subsequent antigen presentation second dose vaccine . In order ass immune response boost prolong interval dose modify killed oral cholera vaccine , Phase II double-blind , control , randomize trial evaluate two different dose interval schedule two-dose regimen conduct . This study compare immune response follow 14-day 28-day dosing interval . In addition 356 subject main study , 30 subject enrol explore possibility immunological marker vibrio cholera infection .</detailed_description>
