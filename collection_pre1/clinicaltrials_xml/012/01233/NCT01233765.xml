	<brief_summary>Recent scientific evidence suggest main defence cell body ( neutrophil ) behave different manner patient gum diseaseÍ¾ namely interact bacteria role defence system body . This study propose examine response periodontitis patient healthy control . The propose study include patient undergoing periodontal ( gum ) treatment match periodontally healthy control . Blood , gingival crevicular ( gum ) fluid clinical measure collect pre- post-therapy measure difference cell behaviour , follow routine therapy . Blood sample use isolate peripheral blood neutrophil prior analysis response different bacterial stimulus include oxygen radical , cytokine extracellular trap release . Gingival Crevicular Fluid sample use measure different biochemical marker result production Neutrophil Extracellular Traps ( NETs ) . Routine clinical measure take pre- post-therapy measure treatment response . Patient volunteer undergo treatment ask donate total four small sample tissue gum whilst already anaesthetise routine treatment . These approximately size needle head ( 2mm2mm ) use examine NET formation within tissue related process . This provide novel in-vivo data regard recently discover method neutrophil defence innate immunity . This proposal represent novel study aim improve current understanding inflammatory periodontitis develop patient others , well provide pointer causal/noncausal relationship periodontitis important systemic condition diabetes rheumatoid arthritis . Ultimately , novel treatment approach primary prevention ( periodontitis ) secondary prevention ( systemic disease ) strategy may emerge .</brief_summary>
