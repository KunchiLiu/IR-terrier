	<brief_summary>The aim proposal pioneer implementation evaluation novel patient center text messaging vaccine adverse event surveillance network .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Real-time Influenza Vaccine Surveillance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proposal conduct six clinical site Columbia University Medical Center ( CUMC ) , use customized version already operational technology platform . Our propose 12 month project entail three phase : ( ) 3 month preparatory work , ( b ) 6 month intervention rollout ( c ) 3 month data analysis dissemination . Preparatory work include 3 area : Indepth interview : We conduct series interview patient parent understand perspective vaccine safety Flunet . We also interview sample provider understand effective way service promotion among provider . Design registration process message : We use patient/parental feedback refine critical part implementation , registration process message ( content , frequency , format ) maximize response rate quality information collect , pilot next phase . Technology set test occur prior roll HIPAA compliant data center . The intervention rollout begin 6week refinement period . The primary goal refinement period : ( 1 ) validate/improve methodology ( e.g . registration , logic content interactive menu , data collection process ( 2 ) test application infrastructure require full roll ( 3 ) refine logistic detail , print material patient provider . We interview 25 patient learn experience use Flunet . We also evaluate operation , technology clinical finding intervention incorporate adjustment need . After refinement period , continue monitor system operation ongoing basis . All patient receive vaccine ( vaccinee ) offer service . For child &lt; 18 year age , parent guardian ( parent ) offer service . By call registration number vaccinees/parents agree receive series text message follow vaccinee 's health . Participating location include five community health center one hospital-based clinic , affiliate New York Presbyterian Hospital Ambulatory Care Network ( ACN ) Columbia University . These clinic include general pediatric , general medicine , Obstetric Gynecology ( OBGYN ) family medicine patient . These sit Health Professional Shortage Areas ( HPSA ) . Design preparatory phase ( month 13 ) : Preparatory work implement Flunet entail 3 main activity : ( ) Patient provider interview ( b ) Technology setup ( c ) Logistic task . Rollout Phase ( month 39 ) : The roll entail 3 key activity : ( ) Vaccinee enrollment/registration; ( b ) Service delivery; ( c ) Refinement period final evaluation ( 6 week intervention end ) . At begin , conduct 6 week refinement phase validate improve initial design ( e.g . registration methodology , best sequence content interactive message , data collection process ) . The key component intervention text message exchange information system vaccinees . Information comprise follow topic : ( ) adverse event ( b ) additional message ( primarily health tip influenza season ) . We send registration message weekly message 6 week post-immunization . The first message send enrollment . Messages monitor AEs send week 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , message contain tip education week 3 5 . All message detail preliminary modified base feedback vaccinees/parents obtain patient interview . Messages send language select telephone sign . Additional question ask patient report AEs . Messages may trigger reply design vaccinees'/parents ' response automatically parse replied use rules-based algorithm . Final message base focus group interview .</detailed_description>
