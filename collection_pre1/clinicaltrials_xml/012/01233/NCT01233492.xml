	<brief_title>Boron Phenylalanine With Without Mannitol Treating Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine optimal way deliver boron phenylalanine ( BPA ) without mannitol term route ( intravenous v intraarterial ) , blood-brain barrier disruption , dose use subsequent therapeutic trial boron neutron capture therapy ( BNCT ) patient high-grade glioma . - To evaluate toxicity profile BPA administer intravenously intra-arterially . - To evaluate pharmacokinetic behavior BPA use sample blood , urine , tumor tissue , normal brain tissue , extracellular fluid , cerebrospinal fluid . Secondary - To produce indicative treatment plan use BPA administer either intravenously intra-arterially without mannitol support design combination study use BPA thermal neutron BNCT . Tertiary - To evaluate micro-distribution boron result different route administration use secondary ion mass spectroscopy ( SIMS ) . - To store surplus tissue remove trial possible future study . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . - Stage 1 ( Route Blood Brain Barrier Disruption [ BBBD ] ) : Patients receive one dose boron phenylalanine intravenously ( IV ) intra-arterially ( IA ) 2 hour . Some patient may receive mannitol IA 30 second receive boron phenylalanine . Patients undergo plan biopsy tumor . Some patient may undergo immediate surgical debulking tumor . Boron distribution data analyze determine optimal administration schedule . Patients stage 2 receives boron phenylalanine via optimal route establish stage 1 . If addition mannitol find beneficial , mannitol use stage 2 - Stage 2 ( Dose-escalation ) : Patients receive 1 2 dos boron phenylalanine IV IA ( determine stage 1 ) 2 hour day 1 . Patients may also receive mannitol IA stage 1 . Tumor tissue , normal brain tissue , cerebrospinal fluid collect biopsy and/or surgery . Some patient undergo blood , urine , extracellular fluid sample collection periodically pharmacokinetic study . Tumor tissue store future study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 7 day month . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK</detailed_description>
