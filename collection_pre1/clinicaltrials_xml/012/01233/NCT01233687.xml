	<brief_summary>This phase I/II study erlotinib AMG 102 previously treat subject advance NSCLC . Subjects enrol recurrent progressive advance stage NSCLC treat least one maximum two prior chemotherapy regimen . The Phase I part study enroll 8-16 subject Phase II part enrol 21-45 subject . The Phase I part study design determine safe combination AMG 102 erlotinib recommend dose Phase II part . The Phase II part determine whether combination AMG102 erlotinib work enough warrant interest combination .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must baseline evaluation perform prior first dose study drug must meet inclusion exclusion criterion . Results baseline evaluation , assure inclusion exclusion criterion satisfy , must review Physician Investigator prior enrollment patient . In addition , patient must thoroughly inform aspect study , include study visit schedule require evaluation regulatory requirement inform consent . The write informed consent must obtain patient prior enrollment . The following criterion apply patient enrol onto study unless otherwise specify . Patients recurrent progressive advanced stage Nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC , SCLC component ) treat least one maximum two prior chemotherapy regimen advance NSCLC . Chemotherapy part initial potentially curative therapy ( give part adjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy ) complete &lt; 1 year count 1 prior regimen . Prior erlotinib , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) TKIs monoclonal antibody target EGFR allow . NOTE : Chemotherapy part initial potentially curative therapy ( give part adjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy ) complete one year prior screen study count prior regimen . If tumor refractory ( progress ) prior chemotherapy regimen , regimen would count . If prior chemotherapy regimen change due reason disease progression ( e.g . poor tolerance , allergic reaction ) , would count separate prior regimen . A chemotherapy drug add `` maintenance '' follow disease stabilization response chemotherapy regimen ( absence prior disease progression ) count separate prior regimen . NOTE : Pathology report document diagnosis NSCLC require review screen physician investigator . Measurable disease ( RECIST version 1.1 ) ( phase II part ) . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status ≤ 2 life expectancy ≥ 3 month . NOTE : For phase I part study , patient ECOG Performance Status 2 exclude . Age ≥ 18 year old ability provide write informed consent obtain prior participation study relate procedure perform . Patients must meet follow laboratory criterion ( within 14 day prior study registration ) : oHematology : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/mm³ Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm³ Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL International normalized ratio ( INR ) ≤ 1.5 prothrombin time ( PT ) /partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) within normal limit ( WNL ) institution oBiochemistry : Total Bilirubin within normal institutional limit . AST/SGOT ALT/SGPT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , except know hepatic metastasis , wherein transaminase may ≤ 5 x institutional ULN . Creatinine clearance 45 ml/min high calculate use CockcroftGault formula . Multiply number 0.85 patient female . Patients must fully recover effect prior surgery , chemotherapy radiation therapy . In case residual effect , must clinically stable , grade 1 less severity meet protocol exclusion criterion . A minimum time period 3 week elapse completion radiation therapy recurrent/metastatic disease enrollment study . A minimum 4 week elapse completion chemotherapy experimental therapy enrollment study . A minimum 4 week elapse prior major surgery ( open biopsy significant traumatic injury ) enrollment study . A minimum 2 week elapse prior minor surgical procedure ( chemotherapy infusion port placement core visceral organ biopsy ) enrollment study . If patient history brain metastasis , brain lesion treat surgery and/or radiation stable repeat image patient neurologically stable stable taper dose corticosteroid . No history prior malignancy , exception curatively treat squamous cell basal carcinoma skin situ cervical cancer , unless 3year diseasefree interval . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day first administration study treatment must willing use two method contraception one barrier method abstain sexual activity study 6 month last study drug administration . Sexually active male female partner must agree use two method accept effective method contraception ( hormonal barrier method , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study . All patient must give sign , informed consent prior registration study . Patients know positivity human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) hepatitis C ; baseline test HIV hepatitis C require . This due unknown effect AMG102 . Patients significant history noncompliance medical regimen inability grant reliable informed consent . Patients mixed tumor smallcell element ineligible . Pregnancy lactation . All female childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior start study treatment . Prior treatment NSCLC EGFR TKIs monoclonal antibody target EGFR . A serious active infection ( &gt; grade 2 ) within 7 day enrollment . A serious underlying medical condition would impair ability patient receive protocol treatment . Untreated brain metastasis . A major surgical procedure significant traumatic injury within 28 day begin treatment , anticipation need major surgery course study per inclusion criterion 3.1 . In addition , patient yet recover prior minor surgery ( central venous access device fine needle aspiration biopsy ) . Thrombosis vascular ischemic event within last twelve month , deep venous thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , transient ischemic attack , cerebral infarction , myocardial infarction Concurrent prior ( within 7 day enrollment ) anticoagulation therapy , except use low dose coumarintype anticoagulant low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis central venous catheter thrombosis Presence peripheral edema &gt; Grade 2 ( CTCAE version 4 ) .</criteria>
