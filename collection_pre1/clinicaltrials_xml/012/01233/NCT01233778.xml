	<detailed_description>The consequence total fat consumption circulate plasma lipid incidence cardiovascular disease long central theme nutrition research . Less well known influence specific fatty acid vascular endothelial function oxidative inflammatory response characteristic atherogenesis . Omega 3 ( ω-3 ) fatty acid , include plant derive alpha-linolenic acid ( 18:3n-3 , ALA ) marine derive eicosapentaenoic ( 20:5n-3 , EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( 22:6n-3 , DHA ) show effectively modulate multiple cardiovascular risk factor epidemiological , animal model human clinical investigation . ALA commonly consume major component dietary canola flaxseed oil recommend intake 1.1 1.6 g/d woman men , respectively . EPA DHA consume fatty fish fish oil algae supplement current recommend intake 500 mg/d ( combine EPA DHA ) . ALA think improve cardiovascular health modulate circulate lipid concentration , alter membrane structure function enhance total ω-3 fatty acid content cell membrane phospholipid , reduce inflammatory reaction block formation arachidonic acid derive eicosanoids . However , extensive knowledge gap understand molecular mechanism clinical efficacy ω-3 fatty acid human health disease prevention . Therefore , purpose study examine relationship . Feeding protocol study treatment : The study proceed double blind , randomize cross-over control feeding study . Each treatment phase 30 day duration , separate 4-week washout period . Subjects consume fix composition precisely control basal , weight-maintaining diet ( 35 % energy fat , 50 % carbohydrate , 15 % protein ) supplement 60g/d follow treatment oil : 1 ) canola oil ; 2 ) DHA enrich canola-oil ; 3 ) high oleic acid canola oil ; 4 ) flax/corn oil ( 40:60 ) ; 5 ) safflower/corn oil ( 75:25 ) . Study diet prepare metabolic kitchen facility clinical site . Three isocaloric meal prepare day every subject . A 7-day rotating menu cycle use . Subjects consume least 1 3 daily meal supervision . The meal prepare packed every subject take . The study control intervention oil deliver milkshake provide twice daily . Subjects instructed consume prepared meal limit intake alcohol 2 drinks/week caffeinated calorie free beverage 40oz ( 5 drink ) per day . Diets plan every subject accord his/her energy requirement nutritionally adequate .</detailed_description>
