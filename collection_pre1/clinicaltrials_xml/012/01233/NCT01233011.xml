	<brief_summary>The Air-Q® intubating laryngeal airway ( Air-Q® ILA ) extraglottic device specifically engineer use standalone laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) rescue device `` Plan B '' device event difficult airway . As type LMA , possible insert endotracheal tube ( ETT ) Air-Q® ILA , either blindly mount fibreoptic bronchoscope ( FOB ) , achieve endotracheal intubation . This prospective observational study Air-Q® ILA 's performance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : The Air-Q® intubating laryngeal airway ( Air-Q® ILA ) act excellent conduit fibreoptic intubation . Background : The laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) use pediatric anesthesia routine difficult airway management . The ideal pediatric LMA device would provide excellent seal low pressure ; facilitate easy endotracheal intubation ; available pediatric size . Such device would invaluable addition difficult pediatric airway management plan , increase likelihood quickly effectively secure difficult airway , decrease risk catastrophic hypoxemia , would increase perioperative safety child . The Air-Q® ILA modify LMA device whose feature encompass characteristic ideal LMA . Our objective determine whether new airway device improvement current standard care . Specific Objectives : To evaluate performance characteristic Air-Q® ILA conduit fibreoptic intubation Methods : Recruitment subject : With ethical institutional review board approval , write parental informed consent , recruit child undergo elective surgery . Children ASA status IV-V , abnormal contraindicate cervical spine flexion/extension/rotation , contraindication LMA placement , require emergency surgery exclude . All child undergo intravenous induction anesthesia , per routine institutional practice . Administration Air-Q® ILA : The Air-Q® ILA insert , ensure adequate ventilation , study investigator undertake fibreoptic-guided endotracheal intubation Air-Q® ILA , Air-Q® ILA remove . The performance characteristic Air-Q® ILA conduit fibreoptic-guided endotracheal intubation evaluate . Data analysis : The arterial oxygen saturation , heart rate , rise end-tidal CO2 report outcome variable , along time take complete fibreoptic intubation . Descriptive data present mean ± SD , median ( range ) , count ( percentage proportion ) appropriate .</detailed_description>
