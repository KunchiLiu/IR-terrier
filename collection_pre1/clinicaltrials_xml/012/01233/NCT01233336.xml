	<brief_summary>This continuation previous study ( registration number : NCT00844987 ) reveal hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) early , good marker myocardial injury prognostic factor post myocardial infarction ( MI ) cardiovascular event presence long-term follow-up . Due potentially important implication result previous study decide continue research HGF patient MI . Now , schedule examine 100 consecutive patient STEMI . HGF assessment perform admission hospital , 1h 24h later discharge . Two follow-up visit plan i.e . 3 6 month MI . During hospitalization 6 month visit echocardiography examination perform . The composite primary endpoint consist cardiovascular event observe hospital course long term-follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) examine study number NCT00844987 potentially useful marker acute myocardial injury . Results study confirm efficacy HGF early marker myocardial necrosis prognostic factor cardiovascular event long term follow . Recent study continuation previous study . The aim confirm maximal value HGF first examination perform ACS ( acute coronary syndrome ) patient show predictive value HGF early late outcome patient ACS . Materials method : 100 patient acute coronary syndrome include study . HGF examine four time i.e . admission , 1h 24h latter discharge . In case 10 patient perform 10 assessment first day ACS . The follow visit take place 3 6 month ACS . During hospitalization 6 month later echocardiography examination perform extension heart dysfunction assess . Control group consist 10-15 health volunteer . The primary endpoint composite endpoint include follow cardiovascular event observed hospitalization 6-month follow : death , reinfarction , coronary intervention ( PCI and/or CABG ) due new ACS exacerbation angina , symptom heart failure , rehospitalization due cardiovascular event stroke context HGF concentration acute stage ACS . As secondary endpoint consider : 1 ) death , 2 ) symptom heart failure 3 ) rehospitalization due cardiac event observed hospitalization 6-month follow-up . All endpoint consider context HGF value value routinely measure marker myocardial injury .</detailed_description>
