	<brief_summary>This non-randomized feasibility study endothelial function , exercise capacity , outcome follow pre-left ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) therapy cardiac transplant . The study period 5 year , 20 patient enrol . The investigator anticipate 15 patient survive complete one year follow period . ( publish survival rate LVAD 75 % one year ) . 10 patient anticipated undergo cardiac transplant within 3 year initial enrollment follow 2nd annual post transplant invasive evaluation . Markers endothelial function study permit comparison select clinical outcome . The hypothesis endothelial function alter implantation LVAD implantation , acutely chronically , may affect exercise capacity , quality life occurrence cardiac allograft vasculopathy post cardiac transplantation .</brief_summary>
