	<brief_summary>Rationale current trial evaluate efficacy safety three dos ( 1.25 µg , 2.5 µg 5.0 µg ex mouthpiece ) tiotropium inhalation solution patient moderate persistent asthma still symptomatic despite regular maintenance therapy inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) . The data collect present trial provide useful information health care provider patient regard efficacy safety daily inhalation three different dos tiotropium solution deliver Respimat® inhaler addition inhale corticosteroid treatment fully control moderate asthma comparison placebo . The Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) tiotropium well establish COPD patient . However , currently PK data available 3 dos tiotropium test trial patient moderate persistent asthma . Tiotropium daily drug . Hence , rationale blood urine sample PK analysis 24 hour subset patient confirm PK 3 dos moderate asthma patient . Rationale 24-hour pulmonary function test sub-investigation demonstrate daily dose tiotropium inhalation solution effective safe treatment moderate persistent asthma .</brief_summary>
