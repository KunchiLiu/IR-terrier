	<brief_summary>This prospective longitudinal study involve 200 infant enrol 12-13 month age . The study use classic nutrition design assess infant ' feeding practice Canada place infant 1-2 year age risk low long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( LCPUFA ) , nutrient know influence growth , brain immune system development . On enrollment , infant assign random nutrition supplement provide omega 6 omega 3 LCPUFA PUFA placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective to1 . determine change dietary fat PUFA intake , change biochemical measure fatty acid status prospectively enrollment 24 months-of-age 2. use nutritional intervention LCPUFA address limit status nutrient impact growth development 24 months-of-age . Primary Endpoints distribution developmental test score , growth quality parental report child illness . The Bayley Mental Motor Scales ( BSID-III ) , Peabody Picture Test , Beery Buktenica Developmental Test , Auditory Continuous Performance Test Test Attention Distractibility use . Growth assess height , weight , adipose tissue mass distribution . Child illness report parent . Secondary endpoint physiologic measure blood pressure , heart rate heart rate variability , genetic variable fatty acid metabolism fatty acid status outcome . Blood collect enrolment 24 months-of-age . Lipids fatty acid assess plasma blood cell . Routine , potentially confound nutrient include iron , vitamin D , choline , folate B12 assess . DNA extract blood cell genotyping . Dietary intake assess use food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ ) , 3 day food diary 24 hour recall . A parent report illness dairy questionnaire modify International Study Asthma Allergies Childhood use assess illness incidence duration . Descriptive statistic use present subject characteristic , dietary intake , growth physiological measure test result total fat . Logistic regression , multivariable-adjusted odds ratio ( ORs ) negative outcome correspond 95 % CI sue assess effect LCPUFA status development , growth health outcome . For multivariate model , potential confounders screen stepwise fashion , covariate regression coefficient P-value &lt; 0.05 ( two-sided ) retain . Performance test compare LCPUFA status low quintile compare high quintile outcome ( i.e . two end distribution differ LCPUFA status ) .</detailed_description>
