	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine ability specific image method , term Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging , provide metabolic functional information use predict overall response preoperative ( neoadjuvant ) chemotherapy patient sarcomas . Sarcoma patient face comparatively poor response rate chemotherapy early , non-invasive indication response could provide physician information necessary make evidence-based change treatment strategy . Patients demonstrate early sign response would spar unnecessary side-effects ineffective chemotherapy regimen , could either switch different regimen undergo surgery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monitoring Chemotherapy Response Soft Tissue Sarcomas Osteosarcomas Using Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study plan measure bone soft tissue sarcoma patient use Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging determine analogous marker response exist patient . The first aim study measure normal volunteer use Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging anatomic region sarcomas typically occur extremity . This provide normal optical property compare sarcoma measurement . The second aim study determine feasibility measure sarcoma patient Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging . Since optical property sarcoma tissue likely different breast tumor tissue , measure small cohort patient baseline ( treatment ) determine typical optical property make necessary instrument adjustment . The third aim study involve measure sarcoma patient use Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging multiple timepoints treatment include baseline , first week neoadjuvant chemotherapy , midpoint therapy , surgical resection . Additionally , patient may measure chemotherapy infusion timepoint show promising preliminary data breast cancer patient . Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging measurement analyze compare overall chemotherapy response determine pathology . Additionally , DOSI measurement compare clinical MRI ( FDG PET/CT ) measurement perform baseline posttreatment prior surgery accord RECIST/PERCIST criterion . Tumor volume reduction ( tumor metabolic change ) chemotherapy compare Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging measurement . Finally , fourth study aim , biopsy specimen patient analyzed immunohistochemistry metabolic , proliferative , necrotic marker . These marker correlate optical marker help understand DOSI inform physician tumor biology sarcoma .</detailed_description>
