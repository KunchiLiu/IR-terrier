	<criteria>Women pathologically demonstrate breast cancer . Patients must candidate neoadjuvant paclitaxel chemotherapy treat oncologist . Generally would include : Women nodepositive breast cancer base ultrasoundguided axillary node biopsy , regardless hormone HER2 receptor status . Women great 1 cm breast cancer imaging ( mammogram , ultrasound , breast MRI ) HER2+ triple negative ( ERPRHER2 ) . Women candidate standard paclitaxel chemotherapy treat oncologist reason . Patients must metastatic disease stag workup chest imaging , CBC , liver function study . A formalinfixed paraffin embed tumor block ( prefer ) unstained slide must available prior biopsy primary tumor . A minimum 5 unstained slide must available . The primary tumor must readily able biopsied palpation . The primary tumor must measurable image modality prior treatment . This imaging modality repeat completion 4 cycle paclitaxel prior surgery . Such imaging modality may include ultrasound , CT , mammography , MRI . MRI prefer image modality . Subjects may prior systemic chemotherapy target therapy regimen administer treatment current breast cancer . Age &gt; 18 year . Breast cancer rare woman &lt; 18 year old . The safety paclitaxel pediatric population breast cancer establish , therefore patient ineligible . Patients must adequate organ marrow function Patient must willing undergo additional biopsy breast tumor . Patient must ability willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients systemic chemotherapy , target therapy radiotherapy cancer within 5 year prior enter study . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition paclitaxel include drug formulate Cremophor ( R ) EL ( polyoxyethylated castor oil ) . Patients know HIV due concern chemotherapy may cause immunosuppression potential infectious complication . Patients nonaspirin anticoagulation ( Coumadin , heparins , clopidogrel ) document bleed disorder exclude due risk bleed biopsy . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active severe infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , malignancy require therapy psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study paclitaxel pregnancy category D drug may cause deleterious effect fetus . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother paclitaxel , breastfeed discontinue mother enrol trial .</criteria>
