	<brief_title>Long-term Safety Study Alogliptin Used Combination With α-glucosidase Inhibitor Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Japan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both insulin hyposecretion insulin-resistance consider involved development type 2 diabetes mellitus . Takeda develop SYR-322 ( alogliptin ) improvement glycemic control patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . Alogliptin inhibitor dipeptidyl peptidase IV ( DPP-IV ) enzyme . DPP-IV think primarily responsible degradation 2 peptide hormone release response nutrient ingestion . It expect inhibition DPP-IV improve glycemic control patient type 2 diabetes . `` To evaluate long-term safety efficacy alogliptin α-glucosidase inhibitor , extension study administer 40 consecutive week ( 52 week start treatment phase 2 dose-ranging study ) participant complete phase 2/3 α-glucosidase inhibitor add study 322/CCT-003 ( NCT01263483 ) .</detailed_description>
