	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Axitinib Locally Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma ( RCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Axitinib design decrease blood supply tumor , may slow tumor growth . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take axitinib mouth 2 time day every day 12 week . The dose may change base side effect may . You take drug 12 hour apart . You take pill time day . If vomit anytime take dose , must `` make '' extra dose , instead take next dose previously schedule . Any miss dose may take late 3 hour next schedule dose , otherwise , skip . A blood pressure monitor give participant home use . You give instruction show monitor blood pressure . You provide calendar record date time dose , blood pressure read take drug . Missed dos also record . You must also bring study drug bottle study visit research nurse count remain pill . A drug list give record drug take within 4 week enrol study study . A new list provide clinic visit . You start new prescription over-the-counter drug talk study doctor , except case medical emergency . Study Visits : At Week 1 : - You ask drug may take . - Your performance status record . - You complete questionnaire kidney cancer care . This questionnaire take 5 minute complete . - Women able become pregnant blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . At Week 3 : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam . - Your performance status record . - You ECG . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test check thyroid function . - Urine ( 2 tablespoon ) collect routine testing . - You complete questionnaire kidney cancer care . At Weeks 5 9 , call ask side effect . This call take 10 minute . At Weeks 7 12 : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test check thyroid function . - Urine ( 2 tablespoon ) collect routine testing . - You complete questionnaire kidney cancer care . - You CT scan chest abdomen check status disease . - At Week 12 , ECG . At Week 13 , surgery remove kidney tumor . You receive separate consent form surgery . At Week 19 : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test check thyroid function . - You complete questionnaire kidney cancer care . - You CT scan chest abdomen check status disease . - If treat high blood pressure take drug , blood pressure monitor blood pressure medication reduce . Once blood pressure reach certain level , manage primary care doctor . After Week 19 , every 4 month ( +/- 2 week ) first 1 year , every 6 month ( +/- 2 week ) third fourth year , every year ( +/- 1 month ) total 5 year post surgery : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam . - Your performance status record . - You CT scan chest abdomen check status disease . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test check thyroid function . - You complete questionnaire kidney cancer care ( first 2 year ) . Length Study : You take axitinib 12 week . You stop take axitinib earlier expected disease get bad severe side effect . In case , move surgery axitinib stop . After surgery , contact study staff every 4 month ( +/- 2 week ) 1 year , every 6 month ( +/- 2 week ) next 2 year every 12 month ( +/- 1 month ) 2 year ( total 5 year surgery ) . This investigational study . Axitinib FDA approve commercially available treat advance kidney cancer adult 1 previous drug treatment disease work . In study , use research purpose . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
