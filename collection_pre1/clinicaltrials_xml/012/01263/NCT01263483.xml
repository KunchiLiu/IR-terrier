	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety alogliptin , daily ( QD ) combine α-glucosidase inhibitor take three time daily ( TID ) type 2 diabetic patient uncontrolled blood glucose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Alogliptin Used Combination With α-glucosidase Inhibitor Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Japan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both insulin hyposecretion insulin-resistance consider involved development type 2 diabetes mellitus . Takeda develop SYR-322 ( alogliptin ) improvement glycemic control patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . Alogliptin inhibitor dipeptidyl peptidase IV ( DPP-IV ) enzyme . DPP-IV think primarily responsible degradation 2 peptide hormone release response nutrient ingestion . It expect inhibition DPP-IV improve glycemic control patient type 2 diabetes . In Japan , α-glucosidase inhibitor widely use first-line treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus . Because alogliptin different mechanism action compare α-glucosidase inhibitor , study evaluate efficacy safety alogliptin combine α-glucosidase inhibitor type 2 diabetic patient uncontrolled blood glucose take α-glucosidase inhibitor receive diet and/or exercise therapy . To evaluate long-term safety efficacy concomitant use alogliptin α-glucosidase inhibitor , subject participate present study could enter long-term extension study SYR-322/OCT-003 ( NCT01263509 ) plan separately .</detailed_description>
