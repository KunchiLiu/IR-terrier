	<brief_title>Effect L-arginine Glutamine Preterm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) common acquire gastrointestinal disease occur predominantly premature infant consider one leading cause morbidity mortality age group ( Schnabl et al. , 2008 ) . Primary prevention NEC priority , since NEC frequently progress nonspecific sign , extensive necrosis within matter hour medical surgical treatment , make successful treatment secondary prevention difficult achieve ( Lin et al. , 2013 ) . One assume novel preventive measure NEC L-arginine &amp; glutamine supplementation high risk infant ( Neu , 2005 ) . We conduct prospective , interventional , single blind clinical study period 1/2011- 3/2014 NICUs Children Hospital &amp; Maternity Hospital Ain Shams University . The study approve Ethical Committee Faculty Medicinie , Ain Shams University . Aim study assess preventive role enteral L-arginine &amp; glutamine NEC assess role glutamine decrease impact sepsis premature neonate . Seventy five preterm neonate enrol . Inclusion criterion GA≤ 34 week assign feed first week life . Exclusion criterion presence contraindication feeding ( e.g . intestinal surgery ) , sever multiple congenital anomaly , intracranial hemorrhage &gt; grade 2 non- bacterial congenital infection . They equally divide 3 group ( L-arginine group , Glutamine group &amp; Control group ) , 25 neonate per group randomly enrol . L-arginine group include 25 preterm neonate among 56 % female . Mean birth weight 1.45kg , mean gestational age 31.84 week , 72 % deliver via CS . Median APGAR score 1 &amp; 5 minute 6 &amp; 8 respectively . As glutamine group , among 25 neonate include , 52 % female , 92 % bear CS . Mean birth weight 1.45kg mean GA 31.84 week . Median APGAR score 5 1st minute ( significantly low 2 group ) 8 5 minute . In control group also include 25 neonate , 56 % female 88 % bear CS . Mean birth weight significantly low compare group ( 1.31 kg ) GA comparable ( 30.64 ) . Median APGAR score 1 &amp; 5 minute 7 &amp; 8 respectively . All study subject receive usual care medication accord treat physician ' protocol management . Additionally , L-arginine group receive enteral l-arginine supplementation ( start 0.75mmol/kg/day reach 1.5 mmol/kg/day enteral feeding reach 40 % full intake ) , glutamine group additionally receive enteral glutamine supplementation ( start 156mg/kg/day reach 312 mg/kg/day enteral feeding reach 40 % full intake ) . The additional enteral supplementation add start feeding . Study subject follow daily since time enrollment till discharge , die complete 30 day life . Daily measurement weight , blood pressure blood sugar level do . Feeding protocol patient record regard age feeding initiate , daily increment feeding , frequency feed intolerance , stoppage feeding stage NEC . Frequency septic episode hospital stay also record . Plasma l-arginine &amp; glutamine level measure time enrollment ( sample 1 ) , 15 day enrollment ( sample 2 ) time diagnosis stage NEC ( sample 3 ) . Staging diagnosis do accord Bell 's criterion . Transcranial ultrasound do study subject time enrollment , discharge whenever need . Overall incidence NEC 12 % . Comparing group , glutamine group significant low incidence NEC difference NEC incidence find L-arginine &amp; control group . Lower gestational age birth weight significant risk factor , however ; n't affect age NEC diagnosis . MOD , gender , age start feed daily increment ( wither &gt; 20cc ≤ 20 cc/kg/day ) also n't affect incidence NEC . Regarding NEC outcome,3 patient diagnose NEC arginine group among one suffer stage 1 ( improve ) , one suffer stage 2 NEC ( improve ) , one suffer stage 2 ( die ) , control group , among 6 diagnosed neonate , one suffer stage 1 ( die ) , 5 suffer stage 2 ( 0ne improve &amp; 4 die ) . Occurrence NEC significantly increase risk mortality &amp; delay reach full oral intake . Overall mortality whole study 13.3 % . No significant difference 3 group . While age start feed significantly high glutamine group ( p &lt; 0.05 ) , effect length stay clinical outcome 3 group . Regarding frequency septic episode , length stay attack feed intolerance , significant difference report 3 group . As plasma level l-arginine &amp; glutamine , significant difference estimate among control glutamine group regard initial glutamine level edscap group significantly high initial l-arginine level compare l- arginine group . Both l-arginine glutamine level significantly high sample 2 group compare sample 1 patient . However , level sample 2 significantly correlate initial level rather diverse enteral supplementation . No correlation find l-arginine glutamine plasma level point diagnosis NEC initial level , gestational age birth weight . Reaching full oral intake significantly delay NEC patient , n't affect age initiation feeding . Assessing side effect may contribute L-arginine , incidence hypotension require inotropic management hyperglycemia require insulin therapy show statistical significance 3 group denote possible safety . Finally , study support find enteral glutamine supplementation may helpful decrease incidence NEC preterm neonate . However , beneficial role proven arginine NEC , glutamine sepsis . Larger study need confirm result .</detailed_description>
