	<brief_summary>Among antidepressant treatment , ECT stand effective treat acute depression . However , patient concern cognitive side effect ECT encourage development new focal form brain stimulation transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) . However , patient may respond treatment way currently administer raise interest find alternative , possibly optimal way administer tDCS . This study investigate whether tDCS stimulation use alternative electrode montage antidepressant effect .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Subject meet criteria DSMIV Major Depressive Episode . 2 . Total MADRS score â‰¥20 . 3 . Subject respond tDCS give standard montage OR subject unable receive tDCS standard montage example , due skin rash etc site electrode placement standard montage . 1 . Diagnosis ( defined DSMIV ) : psychotic disorder ( lifetime ) ; eat disorder ( current within past year ) ; obsessive compulsive disorder ( lifetime ) ; posttraumatic stress disorder ( current within past year ) ; mental retardation . 2 . History drug alcohol abuse dependence ( per DSMIV criterion ) within last 3 month ( except nicotine caffeine ) . 3 . Inadequate response ECT current episode depression . 4 . Subject regular benzodiazepine medication clinically appropriate discontinue . 5 . Subject require rapid clinical response due inanition , psychosis high suicide risk . 6 . Neurological disorder insult , e.g. , recent stroke ( CVA ) , place subject risk seizure neuronal damage tDCS . 7 . Subject metal cranium , skull defect , skin lesion scalp ( cut , abrasion , rash ) propose electrode site . 8 . Female subject pregnant . 9 . Participants fluent English include trial safety reason : ) It usually possible interpreter reliably available every weekday 4 week safe give tDCS subject tell u immediately side effect ; b ) As novel treatment , study involves detail neuropsychological test safety reason . This test effectively validly complete someone fluent English . Note translation propose test English validate confident neuropsychological impairment would detect use method .</criteria>
