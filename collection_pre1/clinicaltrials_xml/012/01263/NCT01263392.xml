	<brief_summary>The primary aim study determine use SpeediCath hydrophilic catheter would reduce incidence symptomatic urinary tract infection ( UTI ) child spina bifida perform clean intermittent catheterization bladder management . The hypothesis incidence symptomatic urinary tract infection would significantly reduce ( 25 % ) user SpeediCath hydrophilic catheter compare user reuse polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) catheter . Subjects randomly assign either start study PVC catheter 6 month follow hydrophilic catheter 6 month visa versa . Each subject keep weekly diary record urinary tract infection symptom , hematuria determine urine dipstick , physician visit , day miss school activity . At end 6 month subject complete questionnaire record comfort satisfaction use PVC hydrophilic coat catheter . 70 subject randomize 46 complete data . There difference febrile UTI , antibiotic use , healthcare visit school day miss . The incidence self report UTI low PVC group hydrophilic group . 40 % subject indicate hydrophilic coat catheter slippery difficult handle compare 10 % PVC catheter . However overall satisfaction different product . The study result consistent current Cochrane Review lack evidence state incidence UTI affect multiuse hydrophilic catheter use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Urinary Tract Infections Children With Spina Bifida Using Two Types Catheters Catheterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intermittent catheterisation ( IC ) accept management maintain bladder renal health individual incomplete bladder empty . Two common product available IC : polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) single use hydrophilic coat PVC . In 2004 UK spend around £33 million hydrophilic catheter compare £3 million PVC catheter . Proposed advantage lubricate hydrophilic catheter PVC catheter : 1. low incidence symptomatic urinary tract infection ( UTI ) 2. low incidence urethral irritation , trauma urethral stricture repeat IC . Complications UTIs costly individual system despite 25 RCTs topic , remain lack evidence indicate superiority one product another community dwell IC user . Purpose : To compare incidence symptomatic UTI child spina bifida use single use hydrophilic ( SpeediCath™ ) PVC catheter IC . Secondary aim : compare difference weekly urinalysis blood leukocyte ; physician visit , antibiotic use , day miss school activity ; subject care provider satisfaction study catheter product . Study Design , material method : Randomised crossover two arm trial four Western Canada paediatric site : arm 24 week single use hydrophilic PVC catheter clean soap water ( standard care ) . Symptomatic UTI define positive leukocyte plus &gt; 1 fever , flank pain , increase incontinence , malaise , cloudy odorous urine require antibiotic treatment . Randomisation determine study centre use computer generate list random block size 8 . Subject assignment place opaque envelope seal . After consent obtain local research assistant contact site technician open envelope give assignment . Sample size : With power 80 % , expect difference 25 % treatment control α 0.05 , total sample size need 97 subject , use method correlate binary data repeat measure . All data enter impartial technician . It possible blind subject product . Data analyze use Mixed Within-Subjects Between-Subjects Analysis Variance group define catheter type trial begin . SPSS version 20 used analysis . Inclusion Criteria : Child spina bifida living community either self IC receive IC consistent person ; child/parent/caregiver able read understand English . Exclusion criterion : Urethral deformity ( i.e . stricture , false passage ) ; antibiotic prophylaxis ; allergy PVC product ; diabetes mellitus ; history bladder pathology ( i.e . tumour , calculus ) ; surgical history augmentation ( cystoplasty , continent diversion ) . Results : 70 subject randomize ; 46 complete data 48 week ; 24 dropout : hydrophilic catheter slippery ( 15 % ) ; refuse PVC arm prefer hydrophilic catheter ( 5 % ) ; book continent diversion ( 4 % ) , ( 8 % ) . Mean age 10.6 ( SD 6.2 ) , 21 male 25 female . All perform IC &gt; 3/day : 52 % self 48 % parents/ caregiver ; PVC catheter use least 5 time . Mean total week self-reported UTI 3.6 ( SD 4.7 ) hydrophilic group vs. 2.3 ( SD 3.3 ) PVC group ( p= &lt; .001 ) statistical difference week febrile UTI , antibiotic use , visit physician , day miss school , microscopic haematuria ( urine dip ) . There trend few week positive leukocyte hydrophilic group ( Table 1 ) . There statistically significant difference Convenience Comfort . Ease Handling significantly different 40 % dislike hydrophilic product compare 10 % PVC product . Fewer participant answer `` yes '' `` would continue use product '' ( hydrophilic vs. PVC 65 % vs. 90 % respectively ) . However , overall satisfaction different product ( Table 2 ) . Interpretation Results : The study underpowered despite major attempt recruitment . However finding clinically relevant . The hydrophilic catheter difficult handle therefore less likely continued PVC multiuse product . Participants overcame handle issue find product excellent . Incidence febrile UTI antibiotic treat UTI appear affect single use vs. multiuse product . Conclusions : A hydrophilic catheter appear reduce febrile UTI antibiotic use community dwell child use CIC . Attrition high base participant ' lack adjustment hydrophilic product study fatigue . The study result consistent exist Cochrane Review : lack evidence state incidence UTI affect multiuse hydrophilic catheter use . Large multicentre trial strongly recommend .
