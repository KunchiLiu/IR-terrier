	<brief_title>Symptoms Degeneration Shoulder Wheelchair-users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The force shoulder joint high handicap people use wheelchair . The prevalence chronic shoulder pain wheelchair-users high 50-80 % . Especially paraplegia develop adult year predispose shoulder pain . The reason short adaption time tissue . Dysbalance musculature shoulder joint conveys chronic pain . The risk chronic shoulder pain rise wheelchair-users , cause lack recovery-time . After exercise wheelchair user depend shoulder order manage daily living . The request study identify determinant shoulder pathology . Precocious finding pathologic change MRI scan , muscular dysbalance , clinical test and/or ultrasound-scans lead certain conclusion . The result use get long-term disorder free situation sportive wheelchair user . Scientific background : International publication show relatively uniform result . Paraplegic people non disabled high performance athlete overhead sport show cumulative pathologic finding MRI scan . There minor correlation MRI find clinical symptom . It known heavy impact MRI finding develop long term disorder shoulder wheelchair user . Isokinetic power measurement adequate examination paraplegic people evaluate function shoulder . Findings non disabled high performance athlete : 40 % asymptomatic high performance athlete overhead sport show pathology rotator cuff dominant arm MRI ( 0 % non dominant arm ) ( Connor et al . 2003 ) . 10 asymptomatic College Baseball player go clinical MRI examination ( Halbrecht et al . 1999 ) . It show pathologic finding rotator cuff dominant side 7 10 case . The finding MRI correlate neither symptom level instability . 30 asymptomatic athlete 52 long distance kayakers examine shoulder MRI ( Hagemann et al . 2004 ) . 13 asymptomatic kayaker show pathologic finding MRI . The author conclude , objective MRI finding subjective discomfort highly correlate . 30 high performance handball player show low correlation MRI find clinical symptom ( Jost et al . 2005 ) . 93 % pathologic MRI finding , 37 % symptomatic . These study eliminate , clinical symptom subjective impression , come career athlete well diagnose MRI . Statements long term effect rotator cuff tear make . Kelly et al . provide evidence rotator cuff tear MRI 12 non sportive people . 6 symptomatic , 6 symptomatic . The subject symptomatic show low activation M. suprascapularis high activation M. trapezius , M. supraspinatus infraspinatus EMG diagnosis . In spite comparable MRI result asymptomatic subject show different pattern innervation rotator cuff , symptomatic subject . This could lead development muscular dysbalance longterm defect asymptomatic patient . 14 Baseball player , shoulder injury shoulder , get MRI scan ( Miniaci et al . 2002 ) . 22 28 examine shoulder show pathologic finding labrum . 10 athlete asymptomatic . This another example considerable difference felt discomfort MRI finding . This statement focus long term disorder . MRI examination paraplegic : Escobedo et al . study examine 26 symptomatic paraplegic MRI scan shoulder . The MRI finding compare 17 non disabled subject , symptomatic shoulder well ( Escobedo et al . 1997 ) . 73 % symptomatic paraplegic ( 59 % non disable ) show rotator cuff tear follow disorder MRI scan . 38 % injured multiple disorder . Boninger et al . compare force input wheelchair MRI find 14 paraplegic , average 33 year old . The subject asymptomatic without previous shoulder injury ( Boninger et al . 2003 ) . In interval 2 year MRI scan make . The subject participate study average 10 year injury spine .</detailed_description>
