Patients randomized intervention group receive attend biosketch card , whereas patient randomize control group receive card . Our hypothesis patient intervention group ( receive attend biosketch card ) would higher patient satisfaction score regard overall care provide attend orthopaedic trauma surgeon .</detailed_description>
