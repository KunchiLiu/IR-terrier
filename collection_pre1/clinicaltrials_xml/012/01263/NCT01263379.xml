	<brief_summary>This trial create skin graft , investigator call `` LEAES , '' use patient 's skin cell genetically engineer lab express miss protein call type VII collagen . The corrected cell transplant back patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Transfer Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research project involve gene transfer keratinocytes , majority cell outer layer skin . In gene transfer trial plan biopsy skin tissue , grow cell skin cell culture ( sterile dish special fluid allow cell grow multiply ) infect cell virus genetically engineer insert correct type VII collagen gene . The cell make type VII collagen . The process insert correct type VII collagen gene cell call `` gene transfer . '' The virus use call `` retrovirus . '' The virus make delivers type VII collagen gene spread part body . During study check growth virus . After cell receive gene transfer , grow cell culture sheet cell look like plastic film . We plan graft sheet wound . Grafting mean take cell culture stitch patient 's skin .</detailed_description>
