	<brief_summary>The primary objective randomize control trial evaluate safety efficacy TransDiscal System ( TDS ) treat discogenic pain lumbar spine use modify disc biacuplasty procedure . The primary efficacy measure Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) 6 month post treatment/randomization TransDiscal System compare medical management ( standard care ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy TransDiscal System Versus Medical Management Treating Chronic Discogenic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intervertebral disc serve joint vertebral body , provide structural support flexibility spinal column . Intervertebral disc remain structurally intact lifetime degenerate natural part age . Degenerated discs react stress force healthy disc . When much stress apply degenerated disc , tear result . Evidence suggest tear present , sensory nerve ending grow tear transmit pain . The TransDiscal System ( TDS ) medical device use procedure call Disc Biacuplasty currently available United States throughout world . The TDS enable back disc heat high enough temperature ablate nerve inside transmit pain , maintain low enough temperature prevent damage surround tissue . The TDS use two electrode , locate end two thin probe , place side back intervertebral disc insert skin disc use x-ray guidance . Radiofrequency ( RF ) current flow disc two electrode , heat tissue disc desire temperature . The study evaluate modify heat protocol currently clinical use allow large area back disc heat .</detailed_description>
