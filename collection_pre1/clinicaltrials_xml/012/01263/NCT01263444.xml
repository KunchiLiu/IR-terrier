	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis ocular hypertension , primary open angle ( include pigment dispersion ) glaucoma eye . IOP consider safe , eye , way assure clinical stability vision optic nerve throughout study period . Treated , Investigator 's judgment demonstrate inadequate response , prostaglandin monotherapy minimum 4 week Visit 1 . Last dose prostaglandin instill correctly put patient within dose cycle Visit 1 . At Visit 1 , IOP ≥ 20 mmHg least one eye ≤ 35 mmHg eye treat prostaglandin monotherapy . Best correct visual acuity 1.0 LogMAR good eye . In eye qualifying study eye , IOP able control pharmacologic therapy prostaglandin monotherapy alone . Willing sign inform consent form . Able follow instruction willing able attend require study visit . Other protocoldefined inclusion criterion may apply . Known medical history allergy , hypersensitivity poor tolerance component AZARGA® deem clinically significant opinion investigator . A history , risk uveitis cystoid macular edema ( CME ) . History ocular herpes simplex . Corneal dystrophies either eye . Concurrent infectious/non infectious conjunctivitis , keratitis uveitis either eye ( exclude Blepharitis nonclinically significant conjunctival hyperemia ) . Intraocular conventional surgery laser surgery study eye ( ) less 3 month prior Visit 1 . Risk visual field visual acuity worsen consequence participation study , investigator 's best judgment . Progressive retinal optic nerve disease cause apart glaucoma . Use systemic medication know affect IOP ( e.g . oral betaadrenergic blocker , alphaagonists blocker , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor calcium channel blocker ) , stable course 7 day prior Visit 1 anticipated change dosage course study . Use corticosteroid ( oral , topical ocular nasal ) within 30 day Visit 1 course study . Bronchial asthma history bronchial asthma , bronchial hyper reactivity , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease would preclude safe administration topical betablocker . History severe allergic rhinitis . A condition , opinion principal investigator , would interfere optimal participation study , would present special risk subject . Use systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ( CAI ) ( e.g . methazolamide [ Neptazane ] , acetazolamide [ Diamox ] ) . Severely impared renal function . History allergy sulphonamides . Bronchial asthma history bronchial asthma , bronchial hyper reactivity , severe allergic rhinitis severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease would preclude safe administration topical betablocker . Pregnant , lactating , childbearing potential use reliable method birth control . Any clinically significant , serious , severe medical condition . Participation investigational study within 30 day prior screening/baseline visit . Other protocoldefined exclusion criterion may apply .</criteria>
