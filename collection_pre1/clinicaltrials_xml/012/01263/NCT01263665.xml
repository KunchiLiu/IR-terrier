	<criteria>Lifestylelimiting claudication rest pain ( meet angiographic entry criterion ) affect low extremity ( Rutherford Categories 24 ) . A write informed consent form , review approve Ethics Committee , read , understood sign subject ( legally authorize representative ) . At least 21 year age . Noninvasive low extremity arterial study ( anklebrachial index , ABI ) prior ( within 45 day ) time study procedure demonstrate rest anklebrachial index ( ABI ) ≤ 0.9 study limb . If ABI &gt; 0.9 , patient eligible study toebrachial index ( TBI ) ≤ 0.5 . A staged ipsilateral vascular procedure complete less 30days prior study procedure . Resting ABIs complete prior study procedure minimum 30days stag vascular procedure . Vascular treatment nonstudy leg bilateral claudication perform less 30days prior study procedure . Resting ABIs study limb complete prior study procedure minimum 30days treatment nonstudy leg . Male , infertile female , female child bear potential practicing acceptable method birth control negative pregnancy test within 7days prior study procedure . Projected life expectancy great three year . The ability comply protocol followup requirement require test . Angiographic Lesion Requirements ( assess intraoperatively ) : Lesion length 2035 cm locate region begin 1 cm origin profunda femoris artery end 1 cm origin intercondylar fossa . De novo , postpercutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) , postatherectomy stenosis ( &gt; 50 % point within lesion visual estimate ) occlusion native SFA . Origin proximal 1 cm SFA patent . Popliteal artery patent 1 cm origin intercondylar fossa distal radiographic knee joint . Reference vessel diameter 4.0 7.5 mm proximal distal treatment segment within SFA . Angiographic evidence least one patent tibial artery ankle require intervention . Guidewire successfully traverse lesion within true lumen distal vessel . Untreated flowlimiting aortoiliac occlusive disease . Any previous open surgical procedure target vessel previous stent placement target vessel . Prior angioplasty target lesion perform less 30 day prior study procedure ( unless perform time study procedure ) . Prior atherectomy target lesion perform less 6 month prior study procedure ( unless perform time study procedure ) . Any previous treatment target vessel drugeluting balloon . Femoral artery popliteal artery aneurysm . Nonatherosclerotic disease result occlusion ( e.g . embolism , Buerger 's disease , vasculitis ) . Tibial artery disease require treatment . Prior ipsilateral femoral artery bypass . Severe medical comorbidities ( untreated coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , metastatic malignancy , dementia , etc . ) medical condition would preclude postprocedural ambulation . Popliteal artery vascular access time procedure . Antegrade retrograde vascular access common femoral artery time SFA intervention . Major distal amputation ( transmetatarsal ) study nonstudy limb . Septicemia . Any previously know coagulation disorder , include hypercoagulability . Morbid obesity operative scarring precludes percutaneous approach ( physician 's discretion ) . Contraindication anticoagulation antiplatelet therapy . Known allergy stent/stentgraft component , include heparin sensitivity , allergy , previous incidence heparininduced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) type II . History prior lifethreatening reaction contrast agent . Currently participate another clinical research trial , unless approve W. L. Gore &amp; Associates advance study enrollment . Subject one limb currently enrol study . Current peritoneal hemodialysis .</criteria>
