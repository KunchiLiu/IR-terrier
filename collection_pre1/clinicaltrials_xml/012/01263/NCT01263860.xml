	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial 24-Week Versus 48-Week Courses Peginterferon Plus Ribavirin HCV Genotype-6 Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High rate infection Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) Genotype 6 recently confirm Southern China . Recent study imply chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 responds well 48-week treatment pegylated interferon ribavirin genotype 1 . Approximately 75.7 % obtain sustained virological response ( HCV RNA undetectable 24 week treatment ) approach . However , treatment associate many sometimes serious side effect . In addition , treatment costly also economical term . Shorter treatment chronic hepatitis C genotype 6 necessary assess . In randomised , open label , multicenter phase 3 trial active control patient treat pegylated interferon alfa 2a ( 180ug/week ) ribavirin ( 800-1200mg base weight ) 4 week . Those HCV RNA negative week 4 ( &lt; 50 IU ; Cobas Amplicor Monitor Test , Roche Diagnostic ) define rapid virological responder randomise either additional 20 44 week combination treatment . Patients HCV RNA positive treat 44 week . The endpoint sustain virological response define undetectable HCV RNA 24 week end treatment . Our hypothesis important difference effect two group . This non-inferiority trial . The small difference consider clinically important 15 % . Thus state `` non-inferiority '' 95 % confidence interval observe difference group shall overlap 10 % . Both intention treat per protocol analysis publish . Conclusion conservative base analysis detect big difference .</detailed_description>
