	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose Akt inhibitor MK2206 ( MK2206 ) give together paclitaxel see well work treat patient solid tumor spread place body usually cure controlled treatment breast cancer spread place body . Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving Akt inhibitor MK2206 paclitaxel may better treatment solid tumor breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination MK-2206 weekly paclitaxel . ( Dose-escalation phase ) II . To determine safety anti-tumor activity combination metastatic breast cancer . ( Expansion phase ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacokinetics MK-2206 weekly paclitaxel use combination . II . To determine safety MK-2206 weekly paclitaxel use combination . III . To evaluate toxicity tolerability combination . IV . To document anti-tumor activity . V. To determine baseline molecular marker may predict clinical activity . VI . To determine pharmacodynamic marker blood tumor tissue may predict increase apoptosis ( cleaved caspase 3 ) clinical activity . VII . To determine concordance phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase , catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) status primary tumor distant metastasis . VIII . To determine concordance PIK3CA status circulate tumor cell distant metastasis . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study Akt inhibitor MK2206 . Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 2 , 9 , 16 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 week .</detailed_description>
