	<brief_summary>This research study include two type non-Hodgkin Lymphoma ( NHL ) , follicular lymphoma marginal zone lymphoma participant age 70 older . The purpose research study learn safety treatment drug ofatumumab find effect , good bad treatment lymphoma . Ofatumumab monoclonal antibody . Monoclonal antibody use treat type cancer . Monoclonal antibody type protein make laboratory bind substance body include cancer cell . Ofatumumab bind protein call CD20 , find B-cells lymphoma cell . The study drug , Ofatumumab , approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment type blood cancer approve use patient non-Hodgkin Lymphoma . The use ofatumumab study consider investigational . In addition learning ofatumumab , researcher interested learn cancer treatment affect daily activity . Participants ask complete Geriatric Assessment ( GA ) . GAs design gather information memory , nutritional status , mental health , level social support . This assessment help health care team understand participant 's `` functional age '' compare participant 's actual age . The researcher also want collect blood sample study molecule follicular lymphoma cell call 'biomarkers ' learn lymphoma respond therapy . A biomarker molecule ( example , DNA protein ) find blood tissue marker disease . In study , investigator measure change biomarker call bcl-2 . This biomarker research subject follicular lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ofatumumab In Older Patients With Untreated Low Or Intermediate Risk Indolent B-Cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter Phase II clinical study investigate overall response rate ( ORR ) 2 month therapy weekly ofatumumab older ( ≥70 year age ) patient previously untreated low intermediate risk indolent NHL ( n=37 ) . Secondary objective include progression free survival ( PFS ) 2 year , evaluation toxicity tolerability ofatumumab population . We also evaluate molecular response ofatumumab perform PCR analysis BCL2/IgH peripheral blood . We conduct exploratory analysis minimum observe serum concentration ( Cmin ) ofatumumab prior last dose correlate level ORR . This trial include administration Geriatric Assessment ( GA ) tool patient ask complete serially trial .</detailed_description>
