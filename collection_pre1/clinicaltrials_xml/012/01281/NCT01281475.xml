	<brief_summary>This study design determine whether levodopa lead improvement development tremor child Angelman syndrome ( AS ) . It suggest levodopa , medication usually use treat Parkinson disease adult , may help child AS overall development reduce tremor . If levodopa find beneficial child AS , could lead new treatment AS .

	<brief_title>A Trial Levodopa Angelman Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Levodopa prodrug `` delivers '' dopamine brain . It usually give carbidopa , peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor , increase bioavailability levodopa . Animal study suggest levodopa reverse excess phosphorylation enzyme involve synaptic neuronal function , include calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase type 2 ( CaMKII ) . Recently , show excess phosphorylation CaMKII may responsible neurological deficit see Angelman syndrome . Therefore , hypothesize levodopa may lead improvement neurodevelopment abnormal movement ( e.g . tremor ) child Angelman syndrome . Although many child use levodopa variety medical condition last 30 year , approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use child , formally study child Angelman syndrome . Therefore , purpose study find whether levodopa lead improvement development tremor child AS .</detailed_description>
