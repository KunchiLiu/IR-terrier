	<brief_summary>Postoperative pain follow total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) ( 1 ) often consider moderate severe therefore influence postoperative course event result delay postoperative mobilization prolong hospitalization . It therefore necessary find optimal method alleviation pain patient . Traditionally , manage epidural analgesia , continuous peripheral nerve block , parental- spinal opioids . Recently , Drs Kerr Kohan Joint Orthopaedic Centre Sydney , Australia develop local infiltration analgesia ( LIA ) technique . The technique introduce Scandinavia 2001 show efficacious knee surgery . The LIA technique base systemic infiltration mixture long-acting local anaesthetic ( ropivacaine ) , non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( ketorolac ) , epinephrine tissue around surgical field achieve satisfactory pain control little physiological disturbance . A catheter leave skin joint cavity , allow repeat injection morning surgery ( 10 ) . Effective pain relief early mobilization reduce hospital stay report following total knee arthroplasty , recently , follow unicompartmental knee arthroplasty . The aim study ass whether LIA technique equi-efficacious intrathecal morphine , standard care hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Pain Relief Following Total Hip Arthroplasty . A Comparison Between Intrathecal Morphine ( IM ) Local Infiltration Analgesia ( LIA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double blind parallel-group study two different method postoperative pain relief total hip arthroplasty , intrathecal morphine ( IM ) local infiltration analgesia ( LIA ) , assess . The study conduct Department Anaesthesiology Intensive Care Department Orthopaedic Surgery , USÖ . A total 80 patient undergoing total hip arthroplasty include study , 40 patient group IM 40 patient group LIA . The patient divide one two group accord computer-generated randomization . Study duration per patient 6 month . Screening basis inclusion exclusion criterion take place preoperative assessment outpatient ' anesthesia clinic 3 - 6 week total hip arthroplasty . One participate investigator inform patient , verbally write , participation study involve . The patient give time ask question consider participation study . If patient want enrol study , inclusion take place preoperative assessment take place total hip arthroplasty . One participating Investigators would inform patient participation study mean . The patient give time ask question consider participation study . The patient enrol study sign date write Informed Preoperative Preparation The patient inform detail surgery , anesthesia , postoperative pain relief physiotherapy . All patient ask complete two health relate quality life questionnaire , SF-36 EQ5D ( appendix 2 3 ) . A baseline value HOOS ( appendix 4 ) NRS ( Numeric Rating Score ) assess prior surgery . The patient also instruct use patient control analgesia ( PCA ) morphine pump serve post-operative rescue medication case pain &gt; 3 numeric rating scale ( NRS ) Dalteparin 5000 IU administer subcutaneously even 10 day , start night surgery thrombo-prophylaxis . Randomisation Randomisation make USÖ Hospital Pharmacy day surgery . The patient randomize two group , 40 patient Group IM 40 patient Group LIA , accord computer-generated randomization . The study medication/saline prepare , blind label pharmacist USÖ Hospital Pharmacy . The hospital pharmacy send double-blinded study medication/saline operate theater day surgery . This way , double blinding ensure neither patient anaesthesiologists , staff attend surgery , staff concern postoperative care patient physiotherapist aware group patient randomize . The study medication/saline store room temperature operate theatre give within one hour time receive . Study medication/saline peri-articular injection postoperative day one kept refrigerator Department Anesthesiology intensive care give . Anaesthesia All patient receive mixture midazolam 0.03 mg/kg orally 1 hour plan surgery . Cloxacillin 1g give intravenously surgery 8 , 16 24 h postoperatively . The operation perform use spinal anaesthesia , perform sit position , use 27G spinal needle . All patient receive bupivacaine plain 5 mg/ml ( 17.5 mg = 3.5 ml ) inject intrathecally . In addition , patient randomize Group IM receive morphine special 0.4 mg/ml ( 0.1 mg =0.25 ml ) patient randomize Group LIA receive equivalent amount ( = 0.25 ml ) normal saline . Total volume injectate patient 3.75 ml . Surgery Perioperative Management The surgery perform standardized way accord routine Örebro University hospital . At end surgery , hip prosthesis place , patient Group LIA would receive total volume 151.5 ml mixture consist : long-acting local anaesthetic ( ropivacaine 2 mg/ml = 150 ml ) , no-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( ketorolac 30 mg/ml = 1 ml ) , epinephrine ( 1 mg/ml = 0.5 ml ) inject intraarticularly surround peri-articular tissue standardize way . Patients Group IM would receive similar volume ( 151.5 ml ) normal saline inject way similar site order ensure double-blinding personnel involve study . A multi-holed catheter ( peri-articular catheter ) would insert tissue plane direct vision standardize way closing wound would connect bacterial filter sterile condition . After surgery patient would transfer post-anaesthesia care unit ( PACU ) thereafter orthopaedic ward management . During first post-operative day , 24 hour surgery follow solution inject peri-articularly via multi-holed catheter nurse blind injectate : Group LIA : 20 ml ropivacaine ( 7.5 mg/ml ) 1 ml ketorolac ( 30 mg/ml ) 1 ml epinephrine ( 0.1 mg/ml ) Group IM : 22 ml saline Total volume injectate patient 22 ml . The multi-holed catheter would remove tip catheter send culture sensitivity test . Any evidence fever local systemic infection record . Pain Management All patient receive 1 g paracetamol orally 4 time day , start morning operation . A patient control analgesia ( PCA ) morphine pump ( 1 mg bolus dose , 6 min lock-out time ) would connect IV patient , serve rescue medication case pain &gt; 3 numeric rating scale ( NRS ; 0 = pain , 10 = worst imaginable pain ) . The patient instruct use day surgery . If pain &lt; 4 12 h period , PCA-pump discontinue tramadol 50 mg give orally 4 times/day necessary rescue medication pain management . All patient would receive Paracetamol 1 g six-hourly basal analgesic . Mobilization Home discharge The first attempt mobilization make 30 min peri-articularly injection study medication/saline , 24 h surgery . The patient ask stand walk 10 step . If unsuccessful , another attempt make mobilize patient every 12 h patient walk 10 step . If 12 h period 9 pm , next attempt would make follow morning . Subsequently , mobilization also quantify use TUG test ( appendix 5 ) postoperative day 1 discharge The patient discharge discharge criterion fulfil : - Mild pain ( NRS &lt; 3 ) sufficiently control oral analgesic - Ability walk elbow crutch - Ability eat drink without nausea vomit - No sign surgical complication The patient also ask register pain ( NRS ) analgesic consumption first 14 postoperative day week 2 , 3 4 . ( appendix 6 ) Recordings Assessments ( Flowchart , appendix 7 ) Demographic data : Age , gender , height weight . Length stay hospital ( LOS ) : The number postoperative day home discharge , day 0 = day surgery would record . Home discharge criterion : - Mild pain ( NRS &lt; 3 ) sufficiently control oral analgesic , - Ability walk elbow crutch - The patient eat drink without nausea vomit - No sign surgical complication . Pain : Pain assessment record NRS scale preoperatively 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 48 hour postoperative , subsequently every 24 hour patient discharge hospital , day 14 3 6 month postoperatively . Pain assessed rest motion ( walk 10 step ) . Analgesic consumption : Morphine consumption record 0 - 4 , 4 - 24 24-48 hour postoperatively . Oral analgesic consumption record day home discharge . The patient ask record pain analgesic consumption day 14 day weekly week 2 , 3 4 . Surgical outcome : The research nurse physiotherapist record hip extension flexion every 24 h discharge 14 day , 3 6 month postoperatively . TUG test perform från postoperative day 1 discharge Patient satisfaction first 24 postoperative hour 7 day rat accord satisfaction score : 1= poor , 2= satisfactory , 3= good 4= excellent . HOOS collect preoperatively , 2 week , 3 6 month postoperatively . Health-related questionnaire : The SF-36 EuroQol ( EQ-5D ) questionnaires collect preoperatively postoperatively day 7 ( EQ-5D ) , 3 6 month . The SF-36 validate health survey consist 36 question measure 8 health concept : physical functioning ( PF ) , role limitation due physical problem ( RP ) , bodily pain ( BP ) , general health ( GH ) , vitality ( VT ) , social functioning ( SF ) , role limitation secondary emotional problem ( RE ) mental health ( MH ) . Additionally , 2 summary score available : standardized physical component ( PCS ) standardize mental component ( MCS ) . The EuroQol ( EQ-5D ) standardise instrument use measure health outcome . It provide single index value 0 1 0 represent death 1 represent perfect health .</detailed_description>
