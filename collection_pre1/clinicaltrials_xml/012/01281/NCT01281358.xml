	<brief_summary>Infants born premature biological risk factor later developmental coordination disorder . Parental stereotype infant fragile environmental factor , spend long period lay back , also contribute motor delay . This study aim develop evaluate computer-based intervention ( Helping Our Premature infant ON good motor skill - HOP-ON ) parent preterm infant . HOP-ON model evidence base strategy develop infant ' fine gross motor skill , aim reduce parental stereotyping . It hypothesise infant whose parent receive HOPON CD-ROM/DVD Booklet good motor skill 12 month adjust age compare whose parent receive control CD-ROM/DVD booklet . Parents infant bear less 32 week gestation ( target n = 138 ) recruit prior discharge neonatal unit randomise either HOP-ON control . The primary outcome motor score ( Bayleys III ) 12 month adjust age . Other outcomes parental confidence perception infant capability 3 month quality movement , infant growth , fine gross motor movement parent stress 12 month . Data analyse blind study condition intention treat basis .</brief_summary>
