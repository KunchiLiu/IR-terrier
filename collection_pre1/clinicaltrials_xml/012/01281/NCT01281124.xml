	<brief_title>Azacitidine Treating Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine ability 5-azacytidine cause DNA hypomethylation re-expression silence tumor suppressor gene stratify high low expression mir29a , b , c. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare molecular study ( mir29 expression tumor suppressor gene methylation ) archival tissue , fresh biopsy pre-treatment sample , post-treatment fresh sample . II . To determine overall response rate CT ( RECIST 1.1 criterion ) PET ( EORTC PET response criterion ) , PFS , OS patient treat azacytidine second- third-line setting . III . To correlate blood microRNA profile ( change microRNA profile ) response azacytidine . OUTLINE : Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously day 1-7 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo tissue blood sample collection baseline periodically study treatment correlative study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 week .</detailed_description>
