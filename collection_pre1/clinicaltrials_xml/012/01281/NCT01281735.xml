	<detailed_description>International study CML child adolescents 1 . Rational objective 1.1 Rational : Chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) malignant disease hematopoietic system characterize presence reciprocal translocation chromosome 9 22 . CML rare disease child adolescent , account 2 % 3 % leukemias age range , annual incidence 1 case per million child ( 1,2,3 ) . A recent report French National Registry childhood leukemia lymphoma reveal incidence 0.6 case per million child 15 year age 1990 1999 France . Characteristics CML seem differ age range compare adult ( 5 ) . In Europe , child adolescent CML include national trial record regional national registry . A European CML-Registry establish improve knowledge concern disease patient age 18 year register . In Europe , national registry recently set UK collect prospectively data patient le 15 year age CML . However , limited information available concern epidemiology characteristic CML childhood . There currently two main treatment option child CML . The first option allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation potentially curative therapy child suitable donor . Transplantation match unrelated donor result overall survival rate 66 % 3 year child CML first chronic phase ( 6 ) . A 5-year overall survival rate 73 % report transplanted match sibling donor ( 7 ) . The second option treatment imatinib mesylate , orally administer antityrosine kinase . Imatinib mesylate well tolerate cytogenetic molecular remission achieve significant percentage child CML ( 8 , 9 ) . However , ability imatinib mesylate cure disease remain unknown . In adult CML , Sokal Hasford report 2 distinct stag system able distinguish patient group different survival . These score system determine cohort patient include adult child , data young patient analyse separately . Moreover , Sokal score determine patient treat busulfan hydroxyurea Hasford score patient receive IFN therapy . Identification prognosis factor determination prognostic scoring system child adolescent CML essential optimize individual treatment strategy age group . All point justify need international network well describe rare disease child adolescents optimize individual treatment strategy . 1.2 Objectives . The main objective study following : - To describe characteristic CML large cohort patient less 18 year age - To describe treatment policy . - To identify prognostic factor age-group - To determine prognostic score system population order optimize individual treatment choice . - To determine side effect long term effect treatment , mainly tyrosine kinase inhibitor effect , growth development pediatric population 2 . Population . All patient le 18 year age newly diagnose Philadelphia positive and/or bcr-abl positive CML eligible whatever phase disease , type treatment enrollment clinical study . However data collected requirement concern ethic policy agreement fulfil ( see section 9 ) 3 . Method The study strictly observational . Retrospective prospective data collect patient flow chart and/or exist database . A steering committee ( SC ) include A Biondi , E De Bont , MF Dresse , J de la Fuente , M Suttorp , J Guilhot F Millot promote international study CML child adolescent . The SC include representative country involve study . The SC agree policy , support implementation , initiate research , raise public awareness study presentation publications.A scientific committee ( SciC ) set . By law regard data property , analysis publication decide scientific committee steer committee . For objective study , work party ( WP ) , open interested participant study.Data provide clinician biologist involve pediatric haematology.The data base study set Clinical Investigation Center ( CIC INSERM 802 ) University Hospital Poitiers ( France ) International Central Data Center ( ICDC ) study charge centralize data . Sophie Zin Ka Yeu responsible monitoring , E Ducasse data base management J Guilhot statistical analysis . The study international.A National Coordinating Center leader identify participate country . The National Coordinating Center charge collect data country . Each leader National Coordinating Center charge register patient send data ICDC ( CIC INSERM 802 , Poitiers , France ) . To avoid double entry , location medical center CML patient diagnose recorded case report form . Moreover , notification new case may cross checked national coordinator national registry available ( example Registre national de hémopathies malignes de l'enfant France ) . 4 . Origin type data : Data include : - Identification number - Demographic data - Date birth - Sex - Medical data Ethnicity collect variation term clinical characteristic ( height example ) pharmacokinetic medication different group child potentially involve . Identifying biological result collect . The ICDC collect data strictly anonymized national coordinating center . Patients identified code include 2 3 letter country 4 digit patient number ( ex : FR/0001 first register Patient France ) . No initial patient use . As country coordinator France , F Millot also collect initial French patient order avoid double registration . These initial computerize . The international ID number immediately provide . 5 . Circulation data The data centralize ICDC study . The ICDC locate Clinical Research Investigation Center University Hospital Poitiers ( France ) . Retrospective data : data collect one step procedure . Prospective data : The data collect use two step procedure . 1 . Notification case : New case notify physicians biologist involve pediatric hematology National Coordinating Center ; regular interval case refer coordinate center ICDC . 2 . Full data collection : The data collect clinical chart patient . The complete data send National Coordinating Center centralize regular interval subsequently ICDC . Follow require twice year . For case CML , yet fix sum money transfer ICDC National Coordinating Center notification case complete data transfer perform . To avoid extra work , data already computerize accept fulfilled requirement ethic , confidentiality partnership rule mention paragraph 7 . When available agreement party , data may come case report form patient include clinical study Registries . Data send regular mail , fax electronic file national coordinator ARC study ICDC . Data receive mail transfer copy use disk ( CD-Rom external disk ) data-manager destroy computer mail box . Data enter Microsoft ACCESS database ICDC . Data base implemented PC ( I ) ( Windows ) locate room dedicate purpose work . A second PC ( II ) place use duplication , backup , quality control analysis data . None 2 PCs offer connection Internet , Intranet . The use electronic case Report form ( e-CRF ) plan . A secure access building room ICDC organize ; specific password login computer use . At regular interval secure storage data perform located secure IDCD room organize purpose . Access data restrict coordinator study , ARC , data manager , biostatistician , Health Authorities , need . 6 . Study duration organization The expected start date August 1 , 2009 . The plan study duration 5 year . Study prolongation depend funding link effective participation centre study . 7 . Analysis data Data analyse use mainly SAS software ( SAS institute , CARY , NC , USA ) . Final analysis provide within 5 year start study . Analysis mainly descriptive . Date inclusion study define date reception notification case ICDC . For purpose descriptive analysis , parameter analyse regular interval : number registered case , baseline characteristic , follow-up outcome variable . Categorical data present frequency , percentage 95 % confidence interval . Quantitative variable present median range , mean standard deviation relevant . Survival data issue event ( time response side-effects , loss duration response… ) ; analyse Kaplan Meier compete risk method . For prognosis factor identification , exploratory analysis perform appropriate . The final statistical plan validate steering committee scientific committee . Reports provide every 6 month end study ARC , data manager , biostatistician Dr F. Millot , coordinator study . These report send national coordinator participant . Results could present Workshops , meeting could publish agreement steer scientific committee . All report publication remain anonymous . 8 . Number Patients : A proximately 100 150 patient per year expect . As number case child adolescent CML low , strict calculation make . The objective collect maximum case improve power study . 9 . Ethical Considerations The child , accord age , parent inform study procedure , accord European policy regard collection transfer data research purpose . Informed consent ( parent , possible , child ) provide . Anonymized data collect present study . Rules accordance Principles Guideline European Community concern clinical study data collection French Law `` Informatique , fichiers et liberté '' ( January 6 , 1978 , updated.It responsibility national coordinator provide insurance concern participation member group accord rule local rule require country .</detailed_description>
