	<brief_summary>Questionnaires frequently use evaluate shoulder function various disease surgery . However , measurement shoulder function presently controversial issue . Shoulder movement analysis base embedded sensor could promise alternative questionnaire . Some study already demonstrate relevance approach . It also demonstrate simple testing procedure include two arm movement produce comparable result complicate test procedure . However , study need extensively establish simplify testing procedure provide trustworthy evaluation patient shoulder function evolution . This study preliminary study aim develop precise testing procedure use future study aim evaluate measurement property simple shoulder function test base movement sensor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Score Shoulder Function Evaluation Based Movement Analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Measurement shoulder function controversial issue . There great variety measurement tool none universally accept . There therefore need develop extensively validated convenient measurement tool . Embedded computerized movement analysis potentially meet requirement measurement shoulder function . Ambulatory measurement device allow application various clinical condition , display adequate precision accuracy , considerably straightforward laboratory-based system . Using Physilog Â® II embed system , Coley ( 2007 ) develop relatively simple score shoulder function ( P Score ) . The method base arm power measurement three-dimensional accelerometer gyroscope seven consecutive shoulder movement . It demonstrate reliability , responsiveness criterion-based validity . However , additional knowledge technological progress could contribute simplification . A secondary analysis Coley 's study data base principal component analysis multiple regression highlight procedure include two selected movement produce comparable result P Score . Moreover , development wireless system considerably simplifies set . Consequently , simpler equivalent measurement procedure consider . However important issue clarify extensive validation study undertaken . The simplicity test procedure allow test replication . However , number movement replication need obtain reliable outcome presently unknown . Relevance test procedure study feasibility also evaluate . A pilot study need clarify issue . Aim The aim pilot study determine number movement replication need obtain reliable result use simplify cinematic shoulder measurement procedure well evaluate test procedure study protocol . Methods Measurement carry four group patient present frequent shoulder condition ( rotator cuff condition , shoulder instability , diaphyseal subcapital humerus fracture , frozen shoulder ) . Measurement procedure include two consecutive measurement , alternatively conduct two evaluator . Currently use functional questionnaire complete stage . Statistical analysis address outcome variability accord number replication reproducibility .</detailed_description>
