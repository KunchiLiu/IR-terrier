	<brief_summary>Background : - Some child experience sudden onset symptom similar find obsessive-compulsive disorder may cause body reaction infection streptococcal bacteria , commonly see strep throat scarlet fever . When body immune system react brain cell follow streptococcal infection , condition know PANDAS ( pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associate streptococcal infection ) . The immune system response inactivate treatment drug know intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) . Because insufficient research IVIG effect immune system child PANDAS , include whether IVIG helpful treat obsessive-compulsive symptom relate PANDAS , researcher interest examine whether IVIG appropriate treatment PANDAS associate symptom . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness intravenous immunoglobulin treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder child PANDAS ( pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associate streptococcal infection ) . Eligibility : - Children 4 12 year age obsessive-compulsive disorder ( without tic disorder ) sudden onset symptom follow Group A streptococcal bacterial infection . Design : - Participants screen telephone obtain medical history information , follow in-person screening National Institutes Health Clinical Center . - Participants admit hospital receive 2 day infusion either IVIG placebo . Frequent blood sample , image study , test perform visit . - Six week inpatient stay , participant return blood sample test . Participants receive study drug , receive drug respond initial IVIG infusion , option receive IVIG time . - Followup visit take place 3 month 6 month first evaluation , follow yearly follow-ups 5 additional year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : This study design test safety efficacy intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) symptoms child PANDAS ( pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associate streptococcal infection ) . Study Population : Thirty-two male female child severe obsessive-compulsive symptom related new onset first recurrence symptom consistent PANDAS subtype OCD . Design : multi-site double-blind placebo-controlled trial . Potential subject screen person NIMH , remote video corroboration team collaborator Yale University . Eligible subject admit 1NW pediatrics inpatient unit Clinical Center assessment , randomization , study drug administration accord protocol . Subjects fail improve 6 week blind IVIG/placebo administration ( 1.0 gm/kg/day IVIG two consecutive day ; total dose 2.0 gm/kg ) eligible receive open-label IVIG . Outcome Measures : - Primary : Improvement obsession , compulsion , neuropsychiatric symptom . - Exploratory : - Reduction titer cross-reactive antibody ( Abs ) - Resolution basal ganglia inflammation ( measure pre-/post-changes MRI volumetric scan inflammatory sequence ) - Normalization select serum CSF cytokine</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Male female child 413 year age . Presence ( Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders Fourth Edition , Text Revision ) DSMIV TR OCD without tic disorder . Moderate great severity symptom , score great equal 20 Children YaleBrown ObsessiveCompulsive Scale ( CYBOCS ) great equal 4 Clinical Global Impression Severity scale ( CGIS ) . The acute onset within previous six month symptom child previously well , first acute recurrence within previous six month , period relatively complete remission symptom . The acuity symptom onset/exacerbation key must severe , dramatic onset , proceed no/minimal symptom maximum severity within 2448 hour . Symptom onset first exacerbation precede within four month GAS infection , document positive throat culture , exposure document GAS infection ( close contact , sibling share bedroom ) , and/or document twofold rise one antiGAS antibody titer antistreptolysin O , antistreptococcal DNAaseB , anticarbohydrate antibody others . Onset/exacerbation OCD accompany least three follow 7 clinical sign symptom . The acuity comorbid symptom must similar OCD symptom occur time interval . 1 . Markedly increase level anxiety , particularly new onset separation anxiety . 2 . Emotional lability , irritability , aggressive behavior and/or personality change . 3 . Sudden difficulty concentration learning . 4 . Developmental regression ( `` babytalk , '' temper tantrum ; behavior atypical actual chronological age ) . 5 . Sleep disorder ( insomnia , night terror , refusal sleep alone ) . 6 . Handwriting deterioration sign motoric dysfunction ( include new onset motor hyperactivity , presence choreiform finger movement ) . 7 . Urinary frequency increase urge urinate ; daytime nighttime secondary enuresis . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : History rheumatic fever , include Sydenham chorea ( neurologic manifestation ) . Presence symptom consistent autism , schizophrenia , psychotic disorder ( unless psychotic symptom onset coincident possible PANDAS attribute OCD ) . Presence neurological disorder tic disorder . IQ &lt; 70 . Child subject need able contribute meaningfully baseline followup rating , report adverse effect , assent participation . Presence serious unstable medical illness psychiatric behavioral symptom would make participation unsafe study procedure difficult tolerate . IgA deficiency ( &lt; 20mg/dL ) . Intravenous immunoglobulin may contain trace IgA , may rarely lead lifethreatening anaphylaxis IgAdeficient participant antiIgA antibody ( Misbah 1993 ) . Hyperviscosity syndromes , increase risk associate IVIG administration . Need live virus vaccine within six month receive IVIG ( may 7.5 month randomization ) since IVIG interfere effectiveness vaccine . IVIG administer sooner two week administration live virus vaccine , reason . Taking nephrotoxic drug . Every concomitant medication subject scrutiny possible consultation pediatric safety monitor randomization study drug . See well . Recent ( less eight week ) initiation cognitivebehavior therapy ( CBT ) . Recent ( less eight week ) initiation change dosage psychotropic medication OCD tic disorder ( e.g. , serotonin reuptake inhibitor OCD , alpha2 agonist antipsychotic tic disorder ) .</criteria>
