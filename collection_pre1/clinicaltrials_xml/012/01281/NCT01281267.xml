	<brief_title>Face Transplantation Treatment Severe Facial Deformity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The United States Department Defense ( DoD ) award Brigham Women 's Hospital ( BWH ) research contract fund 5 face transplantation surgery . The investigator actively seek candidate procedure . The primary requirement consider candidate face transplant surgery : least 18 year old ; lose major part face , nose lip , lose least 25 % facial tissue ; facial injury treat acceptably conventional reconstructive surgery . There number factor investigator consider determine would suitable candidate . From time investigator begin search qualify face transplant recipient continue care investigator provide follow surgery , significant amount time , expertise , attentiveness contribute toward make procedure progressive success . Below overview happens , face transplant procedure . Face transplant candidate go extensive screening process likely last several month . This screen include psychiatric social support evaluation series imaging test help determine patient 's physical mental readiness procedure . If , upon completion screen process , determine patient suitable candidate , investigator place patient transplant wait list . The investigator begin work find donor match recipient 's tissue requirement - e.g. , similar age , right blood type . This search could take many month , , suitable donor find within one year , investigator speak patient determine whether 're willing continue wait . When donor find , investigator immediately inform patient arrive hospital operation . As time type procedure extremely important , patient expect readily available . The area likely reconstruct face transplant central region face , include nose lip , facial structure difficult reconstruct conventional plastic surgery technique . In recent case , face transplant include entire nose ; soft tissue mid-face , include blood vessel , muscle , nerve ; significant portion mid-facial skeleton . Surgeons connect facial graft blood vessel patient 's blood vessel microscope restore blood circulation connect nerve tissue , bone , cartilage muscle , need . While face transplant take place , separate , small surgery also perform . The investigator take skin sample ( graft ) arm donor attach sample patient 's chest abdomen . The intent graft behave like face transplant tissue , eventually become part patient 's skin . This do later investigator take tiny sample ( biopsy ) new chest/abdomen tissue look sign rejection , thereby minimize need disturb new face tissue surgery . Immediately surgery , face transplant recipient take Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) observation . The patient typically stay ICU one two day move private room . At point , physical therapist help patient regain much facial movement possible , psychiatrist discuss psychological concern . The patient stay hospital plastic surgery medical transplant team agree safe patient return home . This post-operative stay anticipate approximately 7-14 day , vary due number factor . Following discharge , face transplant patient need return BWH routine visit . These visit include monitor transplant drug level ( immune suppressant ) regular blood test , image test , assess quality life check return sensation movement face . The investigator also periodically examine small tissue sample chest/abdomen graft microscope look sign rejection . These visit typically take place weekly basis first three month least month first year follow surgery . After first year , expect face transplant patient need visit hospital less less time pass . However , patient prepare make lifetime commitment immune suppressant help prevent rejection transplant face tissue .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 60 year . Loss major part face , nose lip , least 25 % facial tissue . The facial defect restore traditional reconstruction technique . Signed write informed consent . Willing complete psychological social evaluation . Willing take immunosuppressant drug help prevent rejection transplant life . Willing return followup visit determine treat physician comply extensive posttransplant rehabilitation therapy . Willing receive standard vaccination prior transplant , influenza hepatitis B . Active malignancy . High risk return malignancy . History persistent noncompliance . Findings psychological evaluation indicate inability comply physician 's order mental instability . Any diagnosis put subject risk face transplant surgery . Absence adequate donor site skin graft event transplant failure .</criteria>
