	<brief_summary>Background : - The blood-brain barrier help protect central nervous system ( brain spinal cord ) harmful toxin , also prevent potentially useful chemotherapy reach brain tumor . The barrier form tight connection blood vessel cell molecule find surface brain blood vessel Permeability-glycoprotein ( Pgp ) . Pgp may influence whether patient brain tumor know gliomas respond chemotherapy side effect may experience . The compound ( 11C ) N-desmethyl-loperamide ( ( 11C ) dLop ) react Pgp molecule , therefore may use positron emission tomography ( PET ) image study blood brain barrier . Objectives : - To study ability PET imaging ( 11C ) dLop evaluate blood brain barrier brain tumor patient . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age brain tumor characteristic may image technique magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) andPET . Design : - Participants screen full physical examination medical history , blood urine test , tumor image study ( fluorodeoxyglucose PET MRI scan contrast agent ) . - The ( 11C ) dLop scan take 1 hour perform . Participants ask return blood urine test approximately 24 hour PET scan . - Participants followup visit least every 4 month repeat complete history physical exam brain MRI . Participants may repeat scan ( 11C ) dLop various point course cancer treatment , scan twice 12-month period . - Participants follow long possible treatment see imaging ( 11C ) dLop correlate response treatment ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : A potential impedance successful glioma chemotherapy sanctuary tumor behind blood brain barrier . P-glycoprotein ( Pgp ) efflux transporter encode MDR1 contribute functional regulation substrates across cerebrovasular endothelium . Pgp activity patient gliomas may influence response therapy neurotoxicity . ( 11C ) N-desmethyl-loperamide ( 11C ) dLop ) radioligand substrate Pgp , PET image molecular marker may provide non-invasive , vivo method examine Pgp function brain tumor patient . OBJECTIVES : Primary : -To measure uptake ( 11C ) N-desmethyl-loperamide ( ( 11C ) dLop ) use PET image marker Pglycoprotein function patient intracranial gliomas Secondary : - Correlate ( 11C ) dLop PET uptake perfusion MRI parameter FDG PET uptake volume interest ( VOI ) determine baseline MRI - Develop exploratory data correlation ( 11C ) dLop PET image patient outcome response therapy , survival , neurotoxicity - Develop exploratory data correlation ( 11C ) dLop PET image immunohistochemical molecular genomic assay MDR1 Pgp ELIGIBILITY : Patients predominantly non-enhancing intracranial glioma eligible . DESIGN : This pilot study ( 11C ) dLop PET image 10 patient intracranial glioma . Standard uptake value ( SUVs ) correct cerebral blood flow determine ( 15O ) H20 PET scan correlate DCE-MRI ( obtain within prior 2 week ) FDG-PET ( obtain within prior 4 week ) characterize locoregional difference Pgp function . When available , correlative study perform archived tumor tissue acquire immediately subsequent ( 11C ) dLop scan include immunohistochemical assay Pgp expression , well characterization MDR1 polymorphism . Patient case history follow longitudinally make observation ( 11C ) dLop imaging may correlate patient outcome response therapy , survival , neurotoxicity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients histologically prove intracranial glioma eligible protocol . Eligible histology include glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , gliosarcoma ( GS ) , anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) , anaplastic oligodendroglioma ( AO ) , anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma ( AMO ) , malignant astrocytoma NOS ( otherwise specify ) , low grade astrocytoma ( LGA ) , low grade oligoastocytoma ( LOA ) , low grade oligodendroglioma ( LGO ) . Patients radiographically diagnose suspect low grade glioma also eligible . Patients undergone recent resection eligible long follow condition apply : They recover effect surgery , perform within 2 week study scan . Residual enhance nonenhancing disease follow resection recurrent tumor mandate eligibility study . To best assess extent residual disease postoperatively , CT/ MRI do : later 96 hour immediate postoperative period , least 4 week postoperatively , within 14 day registration , steroid dosage stable least 5 day .

All patient previously designate DPA ( patient deem treat physician impair questionably impaired way ability patient give inform consent questionable ) must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study . Patients must great equal 18 year old . Patients must Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 . Patients must significant medical illness investigator opinion adequately control appropriate therapy would compromise patient ability tolerate study . This study design include woman minority , design measure difference intervention effect . Males female recruit preference gender . No exclusion study base race . Minorities actively recruit participate . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients , view treat physician , significant active cardiac , hepatic , renal , psychiatric disease ineligible . Patients active infection . Pregnant ( positive pregnancy test ) nursing woman . Patients take loperamide within three day ( 11C ) dLop image . Concurrent use Pgp inducer list Appendix A within 2 week study scan . Use medication allow course participation study , must administer within 2 week study imaging . Prior participation research protocols clinical care last year radiation exposure , include protocol , would exceed guideline set Radiation Safety Committee ( RSC ) . Patients contraindication gadolinium enhance MRI .</criteria>
