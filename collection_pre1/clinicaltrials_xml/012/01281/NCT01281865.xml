	<brief_title>Everolimus Combination With Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Locally Advanced , Locally Recurrent , Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) everolimus combination imatinib mesylate patient synovial sarcoma . ( Phase I ) II . To determine overall response rate ( RR = CR + PR ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine RR , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) . ( Phase I ) II . To determine predictor response . ( Phase II ) III . To obtain tissue biopsy plasma sample correlative study pre- post-treatment . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study everolimus follow phase II study . Patients receive everolimus orally ( PO ) daily imatinib mesylate PO daily day 1-28 . Course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood tumor tissue sample collection baseline periodically study correlative biomarker protein expression study . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
