	<brief_summary>This phase I/II clinical trial study side effect best dose veliparib give together paclitaxel cisplatin see well work treat patient cervical cancer spread place body usually cure controlled treatment come back . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) give chemotherapy together veliparib may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel , Cisplatin , Veliparib Treating Patients With Advanced , Persistent , Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity ABT-888 ( veliparib ) combine cisplatin paclitaxel woman advance , persistent , recurrent cervical cancer . II . To examine safety administer ABT-888 combine cisplatin paclitaxel . III . Once recommended phase II dose establish , estimate efficacy cisplatin , paclitaxel , ABT-888 respect objective tumor response patient advance , persistent , recurrent carcinoma cervix . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine effect regimen progression-free survival overall survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine proportion patient advance , persistent , recurrent cancer cervix whose tumor demonstrate loss Fanconi anemia group D2 ( FancD2 ) focus formation . III . To determine association loss FancD2 foci formation progression-free survival , overall survival , response patient population . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study veliparib follow phase II study . Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour day 1 , cisplatin IV 1 hour day 2 , veliparib orally ( PO ) day 1-7 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
