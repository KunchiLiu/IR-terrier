	<brief_summary>Background : - The brain chemical serotonin help nerve cell communicate . Previous research suggest serotonin activity may lower brain area seizures start , increase activity serotonin receptor site nerve cell may help prevent seizure . Researchers interested determine whether experimental medication PRX-00023 , increase activity serotonin receptor , reduce seizure frequency people whose seizure well-controlled antiseizure medication . PRX-00023 previously study people epilepsy previously give people take antiseizure medication time . Objectives : - To evaluate effectiveness PRX-00023 reducing frequency epileptic seizure start one part brain . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 65 year age frequent epileptic seizure even try least two different standard anti-seizure medication ( either time one ) . Design : - The study require 9 outpatient visit NIH Clinical Center 34-week period . Individuals choose participate additional study may inpatient visit . - Participants screen medical history physical examination , blood urine sample , ECG , EEG , neuropsychological study , image study , include PET MRI scan - Participants 6-week observation evaluation period start study medication . Participants least four seizure period eligible treatment portion study . - All participant receive either PRX-00023 placebo pill twice daily 12 week , regular clinic visit blood sample image study . - After 12-week period , participant 2- 3-week washout period without study medication . - Participants another study medication period , receive opposite pill ( PRX-00023 placebo ) one take first treatment phase . Participants continue regular clinic visit blood sample , ECG , EEG neuropsychologicalstudies . - One month end second study medication phase , participant followup evaluation physical examination , blood test , ECG , EEG , mood neuropsychological test . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure drug efficacy : Mean difference seizure frequency compare active placebo period . Secondary outcome measure efficacy : Proportion patient great equal 50 % low seizure rate PRX-00023 placebo Hamilton Depression Anxiety Rating scale Performance mood neuropsychological testing scale</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : PRX-00023 selective 5HT1A agonist develop oral therapeutic treatment epilepsy . Objective : To initiate pilot clinical trial assess safety , tolerability efficacy 5HT1A receptor agonist PRX-00023 patient localization-related epilepsy . PRX-00023 5HT1A receptor agonist show promise clinical trial depression . Patients localization-related epilepsy reduce 5HT1A receptor bind 18FCWAY positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Increasing neurotransmitter activity 5HT1A receptor site might ameliorate seizure . Moreover , depression common co-morbidity people epilepsy . Altered 5HT1A receptor bind find depression . Study Population : Thirty adult localization-related epilepsy . Design : A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over , phase II clinical trial . Subjects screen protocol 01-N-0139 undergo medical epilepsy history physical examination , vital sign , ECG , clinical laboratory study include standard clinical chemistry hematology study , urinalysis , pregnancy test female childbearing potential , MRI scan eo EEG monitoring perform previously complete successfully , measurement plasma AED level ( AEDs assay available NIH ) . The trial baseline phase , last 6 week . Baseline may occur concurrent screening procedure . The baseline phase include measurement seizure frequency ( patient record via seizure calendar ) . In addition follow administer , unless previously complete : Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale , neuropsychological mood evaluation , FCWAY PET ( already perform ) , EEG , measurement plasma AED level ( assay available ) , pregnancy test ( woman child bear potential ) , saliva sample obtain genetic testing ( previously obtain ) blood sample obtain PET procedure cortisol ACTH level . Following baseline , patient begin treatment phase ( consist Period 1 Period 2 ) . Patients randomize PRX-00023 ( 120mg BID ) match placebo . After completion first treatment period , patient undergo washout period patient crossed alternate treatment period . Outcome measure : 1 . Seizure frequency count 3-month placebo active treatment phase 2 . Neuropsychological mood index 3 . Safety assessment include adverse event , vital sign , laboratory sign physical examination .</detailed_description>
