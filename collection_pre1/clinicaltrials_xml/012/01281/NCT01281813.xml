	<brief_title>TMC114IFD3001 - Study Providing Continued Access Treatment With Darunavir ( DRV ) /Ritonavir ( Rtv ) Adults Coming From Any Three Ongoing Tibotec-Sponsored Studies With DRV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This continue access trial adult complete treatment darunavir / ritonavir ( DRV/rtv ) clinical trial TMC114-C211 , TMC114-C214 , TMC114-TiDP31-C229 , sponsor Tibotec Pharmaceuticals , continue benefit use DRV/rtv , live country DRV accessible . At baseline visit , inclusion exclusion criterion check confirm eligibility . Once eligibility criterion meet , patient continue treatment follow : HIV-1-infected patient participate TMC114-C211 trial continue DRV/rtv 800/100 mg daily dose regimen emtricitabine / tenofovir ( TDF/FTC ) administer original trial . HIV-1-infected patient participate TMC114-C214 TMC114-TiDP31-C229 trial continue DRV/rtv 600/100 mg twice daily dose regimen administer original trial . Assessment visit recommend accord local , generally accept standard care , less frequently every 6 month . Adverse event ( AEs ) consider least possibly related DRV/rtv , AEs lead discontinuation treatment interruption , serious AEs ( SAEs ) , pregnancy ( AEs applicable per local regulation ) record visit . Patients instructed report AEs investigator , report SAEs within 24 hour Sponsor . In addition assessment flowchart , follow assessment recommend perform locally every 3 month accord local , generally accept standard care : efficacy assessment ( immunology plasma viral load ) laboratory safety assessment ( hematology biochemistry , include pancreatic amylase [ available ] lipase lipid analysis ) . Treatment continue one follow criterion meet ( whichever occurs first ) : significant increase viral load ; treatment-limiting toxicity ; loss follow-up ; withdrawal consent patient ; pregnancy ; termination trial sponsor ; DRV become commercially available adult patient , reimburse , access another source ( eg , access program , government program ) region patient living . A post-treatment follow-up contact perform 4 week last dose trial medication patient ongoing adverse event . This consistent primary objective study provide continue access DRV/rtv adult patient previously receive DR/rtv clinical trial sponsor Tibotec Pharmaceuticals . This study set address specific hypothesis . Depending previous trial patient , continue take either : DRV/rtv 800/100 mg day 2 tablet 400 mg DRV 100 mg ritonavir ; DRV/rtv 600/100 mg twice day 1 tablet 600 mg DRV 100 mg ritonavir twice day .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients treat DRV/rtv successfully complete TMC114C211 , TMC114C214 , TMC114TiDP31C229 trial opinion investigator continue receive benefit use DRV/rtv DRV commercially available patient , reimburse , access another source ( eg , access program , government program ) region patient living . Any condition ( include limit alcohol drug use ) , opinion investigator , could compromise patient 's safety adherence treatment DRV/rtv Any active , clinically significant disease ( pancreas cardiac problem ) finding could compromise patient 's safety treatment DRV/rtv Previously demonstrate clinically significant allergy hypersensitivity excipients investigational medication ( DRV ) ritonavir Pregnant breastfeed female patient .</criteria>
