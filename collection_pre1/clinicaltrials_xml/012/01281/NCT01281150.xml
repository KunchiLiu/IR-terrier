	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial study side effect best dose veliparib give together carboplatin paclitaxel treat patient locally advance metastatic solid tumor . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell block divide . Giving veliparib carboplatin paclitaxel may work well treat patient solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Veliparib Combination With Carboplatin Paclitaxel Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) combination weekly carboplatin , paclitaxel , veliparib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety , tolerability , MTD combination weekly carboplatin , paclitaxel , veliparib . II . To assess safety toxicity combination determine Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4.0 ( CTCAE v. 4.0 ) determine dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . III . To determine pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic effect combination , include determination poly ( adenosine diphosphate [ ADP ] -ribose ) polymerase ( PAR ) tumor specimens available , assessment deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) damage measure gamma H2A histone family , member X ( g-H2AX ) skin biopsy tumor specimen obtain . IV . To assess characteristic primary tumor specimen may contribute efficacy combination include breast cancer , early onset ( BRCA ) immunohistochemistry , gene analysis PARP 1 , PARP 2 , BRCA , triple negative homologous recombination repair ( HRR ) deficiency gene expression signature . V. To document anti-tumor response . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study veliparib . DOSE-ESCALATION : Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 paclitaxel IV 1 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute course 1 3 hour subsequent course day 3 , 10 , 17 . After 4 course , patient receive paclitaxel carboplatin day 3 10 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ( Completed 12/2012 ) EXPANSION COHORT : Patients receive veliparib PO BID day 1-21 paclitaxel IV 1 hour carboplatin IV 3 hour day 3 10 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
