	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) major health problem worldwide . For patient intermediate-stage disease , i.e. , large multifocal HCC without vascular invasion extrahepatic spread , transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) recommend first line therapy survival advantage . TACE perform repeatedly patient recurrent tumor adequate liver function reserve . Two clinical issue TACE remain un-resolved . The first issue possibility TACE-induced liver parenchymal damage , may influence treatment option outcome patient . Conventional way evaluate liver functional reserve , include Child-Pugh score , biochemistry metabolic test , ultrasound elastography , relatively non-specific . The second issue difficulty evaluate TACE efficacy , reliably measure conventional , volumetric response criterion . Both issue resolve optimize patient care . Recently dynamic contrast-enhancing magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) increasingly use analysis perfusion change liver , apply liver parenchyma tumor . Previous study show clinical application perfusion imaging , evaluate severity liver fibrosis cirrhosis , assess effectiveness anti-angiogenic therapy , evaluate tumor viability locoregional therapy . DCE-MRI perform hepatobiliary specific contrast agent , Gd-EOB-DTPA ( Gadoxetic acid , Primovist® , Bayer Schering ) , dual benefit dynamic phase delay hepatobiliary phase imaging . The hepatobiliary phase image provide additional information hepatic lesion characterization functional status hepatocytes . We hypothesize image parameter DCE-MRI Gd-EOB-DTPA could reflect non-tumorous liver parenchymal change use predict monitor treatment response patient HCC TACE . In prospective cohort study , recruit patient refer TACE newly-diagnosed unresectable HCC tumor recurrence operation . Patients treat radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) recruit control group , since RFA associate minimal damage non-tumorous liver parenchyma . Key eligible criterion include chronic hepatitis B , histological clinical diagnosis HCC , tumor amenable surgical treatment refer TACE RFA , ECOG performance status 0 1 , Child-Pugh class A B liver function , measurable tumor ( RECIST 1.1 ) . Eligible patient receive designate treatment ( TACE RFA ) accord current HCC treatment guideline . DCE-MRI Gd-EOB-DTPA use analyze non-tumorous liver parenchymal change treatment response , perform baseline , 3 day 1 month treatment , every 3 month maximum 2 year . The primary endpoint study progression liver function reserve . The estimated time patient recruitment half year , 40 patient 20 patient recruit TACE RFA treatment group , respectively . The image parameter non-tumorous parenchyma tumor analyze correlated clinical liver function parameter , hepatic functional tumor outcome patient .</brief_summary>
