	<brief_title>Lapatinib Ditosylate Akt Inhibitor MK2206 Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability continuous daily administration lapatinib ( lapatinib ditosylate ) combination weekly administration MK2206 ( AKT inhibitor MK2206 ) patient human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -positive advanced breast cancer . II . To determine dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) identify maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) administration schedule . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) MK2206 lapatinib , give alone combination . II . To evaluate potential pharmacogenetic influence candidate drug metabolize enzyme transporter PK MK2206 lapatinib . III . To evaluate change select breast cancer biomarkers phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) /phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) /Akt-signaling pathway , ( e.g. , phosphorylated [ p ] PTEN , PTEN , pAkt , Akt , phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase ( pGSK ) 3-beta , GSK3-beta ) , Wnt/beta-catenin pathway ( e.g. , activated beta-catenin ( ABC ) , beta-catenin ) , pHER2 . IV . To evaluate change breast cancer stem cell ( BCSC ) biomarkers , aldehyde dehydrogenase ( ALDH ) 1 cluster differentiation ( CD ) 44+/CD24- , 2 week treatment combination MK2206 lapatinib MTD . The percent change BCSCs tumor biopsy also evaluate . V. To determine tumor response patient measurable disease assess Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) , percent change BCSCs within tumor vs 2 week combination treatment . VI . To perform genomic profile tumor cell BCSC populations 2 week treatment combination MK2206 lapatinib MTD . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow expansion cohort study . Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1 15-28 course 1 day 1-28 subsequent course . Patients also receive AKT inhibitor MK2206 PO QD day 8 , 15 , 22 course 1 day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
