	<brief_title>Symptomatic Relief Acute Dyspeptic Pain Emergency Department With Pantoprazole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acid-related dyspepsia common among population . Number patient may severe symptom lead emergency department . Mixtures antacid antispasmodic widely use decade relieve acute pain moderate , yet questionable , improvement pain score . Proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) , novel acid-lowering agent , undoubtedly effective reduce acid secretion control dyspeptic symptom short-term long-term duration . To knowledge , previous study conduct evaluate efficacy agent immediate pain relief patient severe dyspeptic symptom emergency care . Clinically , frequently use treat circumstance unofficial manner since intravenous proton pump inhibitor alone yet consider well-approved indication alleviate condition . Pantoprazole , proton pump inhibitor , reach peak serum concentration within one hour acid-lowering effect occur within first hour follow single intravenous infusion . Thus , theoretically rapid onset prolong action acid reduction . Our primary aim study evaluate immediate effect intravenous pantoprazole addition combination oral antacid antispasmodic agent ( conventional regimen ) relief severe acid-related dyspeptic pain .</detailed_description>
