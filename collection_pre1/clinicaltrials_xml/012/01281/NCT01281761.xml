	<brief_summary>Based result preclinical study , investigator suggest addition simvastatin dose cardiovascular use ( 40 ~ 80 mg qd daily ) may overcome cetuximab resistance KRAS mutant colorectal cancer via B-Raf protein degradation induce Bim Bad . Given result phase II FOLFIRI plus cardiovascular dose simvastatin ( 80mg qd daily ) study , phase II study conventional cetuximab treatment 40 mg simvastatin plan metastatic colorectal cancer patient KRAS mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simvastatin + Cetuximab/Irinotecan K-ras Mutant Colorectal Cancer ( CRC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Simvastatin 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA ) reductase inhibitor lead inhibition post-translational modification small G protein . Mevalonate-derived prenyl group , farnesyl pyrophosphate ( FPP ) geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ( GGPP ) , facilitate essential intracellular function various protein Ras Rho . Owing effect post-transcriptional modification Ras Rho , anti-tumor effect statin suggest various cancer cell line . However , recent study utilize cancer gene signatures systematically screen array drug potential anti-tumor effect discover statin potential novel target agent cancer . Given cardiovascular therapeutic dose 1 mg/kg/day translates serum level 0.1 uM patient , investigator previously test report low dose lovastatin range nanomolar 0.3- 1 uM statin induce cell senescence cytostatic effect prostate cancer cell vitro . In addition , investigator previously report well tolerability promise anti-tumor effect combination simvastatin 40 mg daily standard FOLFIRI ( irinotecan , infusional 5-fluorouracil , leucovorin ) metastatic colorectal cancer .</detailed_description>
