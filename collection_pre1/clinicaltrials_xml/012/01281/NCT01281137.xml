	<brief_title>Study Changes Estrogen Levels Grip Strength Postmenopausal Women Who Have Received 4 6 Years Hormone Therapy Breast Cancer Are Currently Receiving Letrozole Clinical Trial IBCSG-35-07</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine serum level estrogen ( Estradiol [ E2 ] , Estrone [ E1 ] , Estrone Sulphate [ E1S ] sex hormone bind globulin [ SHBG ] ) postmenopausal woman prior endocrine-responsive , node-positive , resectable breast cancer complete 4 6 year adjuvant endocrine therapy enrol clinical trial IBCSG-35-07 receiving letrozole . - To determine degree recovery E2 , E1 , E1S 3-month letrozole-off gap . Secondary - To determine association estrogen level change clinical outcome toxicity quality life . - To determine effect prior adjuvant endocrine therapy , age , body mass index , type menopause estrogen level . - To determine variability estrogen level change association germline single nucleotide polymorphism . - To examine change grip-strength score . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . All patient undergo blood sample collection baseline analysis single nucleotide polymorphism , randomization clinical trial IBCSG-35-07 prior begin treatment IBCSG-35-07 . Patients also undergo serum collection baseline 9 , 10.5 , 12 month analysis estrogen level sex hormone binding globulin . Patients undergo measurement grip strength baseline 9 12 month . Samples may bank future research study . Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaire ( Breast Cancer Prevention Trial [ BCPT ] Symptom Scales Form 35-PRS IBCSG Trial 35-07 QL Form ) periodically .</detailed_description>
