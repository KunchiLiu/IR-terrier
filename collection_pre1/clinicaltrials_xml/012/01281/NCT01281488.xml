	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine optimal dose ICG fluorescence visualization use SPY scope near infrared ( NIR ) image technology da Vinci Surgical System detect renal cortical tumor assist removal . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To observe report peri-operative outcome , include limited following observation : positive surgical margin rate , correlation ICG NIR image technology intraoperative ultrasound image preoperative imaging , incidence adverse event , estimate blood loss , blood transfusion rate , length stay , time operation , utility ICG NIR image technology assist localization renal hilar structure , utility ICG NIR image technology assist localization renal mass , warm renal ischemia time measurement , feasibility selective renal arterial clamp ICG NIR image technology , cost analysis retrospective comparison patient underwent similar surgical procedure without use ICG NIR image technology , overall effect ICG NIR image technology postoperative renal function , determination possible future technique variation use ICG NIR image technology improve nephron spar surgery . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients undergo NIR fluorescence image ICG da Vinci Surgical System follow standard approach robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1-2 week .</detailed_description>
