	<brief_summary>Muscle force , explosive strength vertical jump height important parameter determine performance athlete . Traditionally , high intensity resistance training , explosive strength train plyometric training use improve athlete ' performance . Recently , whole body vibration training recommend increase muscle force explosive strength , vibrate platform could provide high gravitational acceleration activate muscle activation sensory input spinal reflex . Design : Prospective randomize control study . Subjects : Healthy male subject regular train competition least 6 hour per week . Methods : H-reflex , V-wave , triceps surae activation level rate force development measure pre-training , mid-training ( 5th week ) post-training . Subjects receive 8 week , 3 times/week , train program include plyometric jumping static squat whole body vibration platform . Data analysis : Data analyze use SPSS 13.0 software ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) two-way ANOVA use data analysis .</brief_summary>
