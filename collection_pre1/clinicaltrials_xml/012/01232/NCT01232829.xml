	<brief_title>Gamma Secretase Inhibitor RO4929097 Previously Treated Metastatic Pancreas Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 6-month survival patient previously treat metastatic pancreas cancer treat gamma secretase RO4929097 . II . To determine adverse event RO4929097 patient population . III . To correlate change tumor marker RO4929097 exposure . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate overall survival population treat RO4929097 . II . To correlate clinical outcome tumor marker ( include stem cell marker ) obtain pre- post- treatment biopsy . ( exploratory ) III . To assess variant gene involve RO4929097 disposition relation RO4929097 exposure . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally ( PO ) daily day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Courses repeat every 21 day 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may undergo tumor biopsy baseline day 16 17 course one biomarker correlative study . Blood sample may also collect baseline periodically study pharmacokinetic angiogenesis marker study . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
