	<brief_summary>The purpose research study gather information NeuroVision System ( FDA clear indication ) placement pedicle screw . NeuroVision machine monitor nerve activity surgery alert surgeon nerve-related issue screw placement . The use nerve monitor standard care center spine surgery . The standard monitoring screw place perform screw place , ensure well position bone ( , screw may remove and/or reposition ) . The NeuroVision System novel feature call `` Dynamic Screw Test '' allow monitoring perform screw place , rather fact . This study do determine real-time monitoring screw placement provide beneficial additional information operating surgeon prevent misplacement screw happen .</brief_summary>
