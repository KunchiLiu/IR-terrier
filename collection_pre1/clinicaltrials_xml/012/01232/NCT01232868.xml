	<brief_summary>Vaccination effective way prevent infectious disease . Despite success vaccine general , vaccine induce diminish antibody response low protection elderly particular . This could explain defect early response age immune system . A good understanding basic immunological mechanism mediate vaccine efficacy incomplete . Such information critical could greatly decrease cost time new vaccine development particularly geriatric population . In trial , investigator study immunologic difference FDA approve licensed influenza vaccine young old group . Twenty two healthy volunteer age 25-40 forty four healthy volunteer age 65 enrol study . Each participant study give one flu shot . Blood work obtain prior vaccination , one day , three day , seven day , fourteen day , well one month six month vaccination . Throughout duration study , participant monitor safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Systems Biology Trivalent Influenza Vaccine ( TIV ) Young Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE : Trivalent Influenza vaccine ( TIV ) know induce diminish functional antibody response low protection elderly . Here hypothesize due intrinsic defect innate response translates suboptimal Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay ( HAI ) titer . Therefore , early innate signature vaccination correlate , predict immunogenicity TIV young elderly . STUDY DESIGN : Single center , open label study adult healthy volunteer contraindication immunization vaccinate TIV . Blood sample collect Days D0 ( enrollment ) D1 , D3 , D7 , D14 , D30 , D180 post vaccination study innate and/or adaptive immunity marker . Even though influenza vaccination consider safe , volunteer ask report local systemic adverse event ( AEs ) Day 0 ( vaccination ) Day 7 memory aid . Reactogenicity event also evaluate injection site examination visit D0 , D1 , D3 D7 . Volunteers also ask report local systemic AEs develop day blood draw . Additionally , AEs consider related ( unlikely , possibly , probably definitely relate ) collect report study Day 0 ( vaccination ) Day 180 . After Day 30 relate SAEs collect report .</detailed_description>
