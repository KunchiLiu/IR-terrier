	<brief_summary>Rationale : Acute exacerbation key event chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , result poor quality life . Causes include irritant , viruses bacterial pathogen . These exacerbation often treat combination corticosteroid , bronchodilator antibiotic , benefit antibiotic therapy remain controversial . Several trial study antibiotic treatment AECOPD show conflict data , several large study fail demonstrate superiority antibiotic therapy placebo . Other trial indicate antibiotic therapy effective patient least two follow symptom : increase dyspnoea , increase sputum volume increase sputum purulence . Ever since sputum purulence use predictive marker AECOPD , strategy integrate GOLD guideline treatment AECOPD . However , color sputum report patient always reliable inspection sputum always possible . Several serum biomarkers C-reactive protein ( CRP ) procalcitonin ( PCT ) available . In recent trial doxycycline addition systemic corticosteroid patient hospitalize AECOPD find CRP might valuable marker predictive response antibiotic treatment AECOPD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : CRP-guided antibiotic therapy compare standard antibiotic therapy AECOPD . Our aim CRP guide therapy lead 20 % reduction antibiotic consumption . Study design : randomize control intervention trial Study population : Hospitalised COPD patient acute exacerbation . Intervention ( applicable ) : Patients type 1 2 exacerbation assign either CRP guide therapy antibiotic therapy accord GOLD guideline . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main endpoint study reduction antibiotic consumption . Furthermore , real incidence infiltrates AECOPD fever study . As secondary outcome objective length hospitalization , time treatment failure within 30-days time next exacerbation assess . The relation level biomarkers presence infiltrate HRCT investigate . Subjective improvement symptom measure symptom ( VAS-LRTI ) quality life assess St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire . Finally , adverse effect antibiotic treatment record . In order observe significant difference antibiotic consumption , 60 % standard antibiotic group 40 % CRP guide antibiotic group , power 0.8 , total 110 patient assigned randomisation group . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Patients treatment arm receive non-experimental treatment . Both treatment option recognize part standard care . The burden associate participation limit total 3 visit hospital phone call data assessment regular follow-up . There specific risk involve participate . Less adverse effect may beneficially patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 40 . No upper age limit employ . Written inform consent obtain . AECOPD accord GOLD guideline . An exacerbation COPD define event natural course disease characterize change patient 's baseline dyspnoea , cough , and/or sputum beyond normal daytoday variation , acute onset , may warrant change regular medication patient underlie COPD . Criteria hospital admission accord GOLD : marked increase symptom ( i.e . rest dyspnoea ) , severe underlie COPD , onset new physical sign ( cyanosis , edema ) , failure respond initial medical management , significant co morbidity , frequent exacerbation , newly occur arrhythmia , diagnostic uncertainty . Former current smoker minimum smoke history 10 pack year . Patients capable ingesting oral medication . Patients mentally capable participate study ( able complete questionnaire perform lung function test ) . Life expectancy â‰¥ 30 day . Pregnant lactate woman , woman childbearing age use acceptable method contraception . Pretreatment corticosteroid ( cumulative dose &gt; 210 mg ) present exacerbation . Progression new radiographic abnormality chest Xray CT scan compatible pneumonia . bronchiectasis ( HRCT confirm ) . Cystic fibrosis . Tuberculosis . Immunodeficiency disorder AIDS , humoral immune defect , ciliary dysfunction etc. , use immunosuppressive drug ( &gt; 30 mg prednisolone/day maintenance dose equivalent 4 week ) . Recent unresolved lung malignancy . Other disease likely require antibiotic therapy , recurrent sinusitis urinary tract infection . Significant gastrointestinal condition may affect study drug absorption . Class III IV congestive heart failure stroke . Newly diagnose pulmonary embolism</criteria>
