	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether single intravitreal ( gel eye ) injection Avastin 0.625mg 0.75mg equivalent ( non-inferior ) treatment standard care laser infant Type I pre-threshold retinopathy prematurity ( ROP ) diagnose 30-36 week gestational age .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Retinopathy Prematurity ( ROP ) lead cause blindness child develop country around world , increase cause blindness develop country . The retina line inside eye . It function `` film '' within camera , eye . When infant bear prematurely , vascular network necessary nourish retina fully develop . As consequence , infant abnormal vessel grow instead normal one -- condition know ROP . The abnormal vessel carry scar tissue along , may lead retinal detachment blindness eye treat . The multi-center trial Cryotherapy Retinopathy Prematurity ( CRYo-ROP ) Study demonstrate ablation peripheral avascular retina reduce risk poor structural visual outcome due retinal distortion detachment ROP ( 1980 's ) . The ablated retina functional amendable regeneration . Peripheral retinal ablation universally effective foster regression ROP . This particularly true aggressive form ROP ( aggressive posterior ROP , APROP ) , typically afflict profoundly premature sick neonate . In subset infant , progression ROP retinal detachment eye even blindness may occur despite timely complete peripheral retinal laser ablation . RATIONALE : The development ROP largely dependant vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . When infant bear prematurely , relatively hyperoxic environment baby introduce shuts production VEGF . Retinal maturation thus delay . Subsequently , time intraocular VEGF level would decline late third trimester pregnancy , abnormally high level VEGF see due large area avascular retina associate tissue hypoxia . The availability FDA-approved drug anti-VEGF treatment render possible treat eye off-label . Available drug include pegaptanib sodium ( Macugen ) partial blockage VEGF-A , drug ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) bevacizumab ( Avastin ) , cause complete blockage VEGF-A . As VEGF require develop retina normal angiogenesis , goal penetrate tissue , block excessive level VEGF trap within overlie vitreous responsible abnormal vasculature ROP . For purpose study , choose bevacizumab ( Avastin ) : ) attain complete blockage ( vs. Macugen ) intravitreal VEGF-A , b ) limit ability penetrate tissue full antibody ( vs. Lucentis , antibody fragment specifically design well tissue penetration ) , likely restore VEGF homeostasis within develop retina .</detailed_description>
