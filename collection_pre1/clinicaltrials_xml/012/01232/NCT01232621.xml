	<brief_title>The Approach Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Conduct clinical research intensive care unit ( ICU ) present challenge include necessity obtain consent patient lack decision-making capacity , operationalize research protocol emergency condition investigate condition high mortality . Most critically ill patient unable comprehend communicate Substitute Decision Makers ( SDMs ) typically provide consent research participation . SDMs critically ill patient may overwhelm patient 's circumstance amount medical information present . Preliminary data suggest SDMs prefer physician involvement consent process . Primary Objective : To demonstrate ability implement randomize control trial ( RCT ) evaluate two different approach introduce research coordinator ( RC ) SDMs ( physician introduction vs. non physician introduction ) participate ICU research study . Secondary Objectives : To describe , among SDMs approach consent participate ICU research study either physician non-physician introduction ( e.g. , nurse , social worker ) ] : ( ) proportion SDMs provide decline consent , ( b ) time meet eligibility criterion sentinel event ( approached consent , either provide decline consent ) , ( c ) reason SDMs provide decline consent , ( ) agreement questionnaire complete SDMs RCs physicians regard acceptance comfort satisfaction approach utilize . Study Overview : We conduct multicentre pilot RCT different method ( physician vs. non-physician introduction research personnel ) approach SDMs consent love one participate critical care research 3 ICUs Ontario . Study Population : This study focus approach SDMs ( n=99 ) critically ill adult eligible ( meet inclusion criterion exclusion criterion ) participate critical care research study progress data collection period , require SDM consent . Interventions : In intervention arm physician introduce RCs study participation SDMs use standardized script . In control arm RCs either introduce introduced non-physician member health care team . RCs complete `` Event Form '' time critically ill adult eligible participate study . `` Site Forms '' `` Study Forms '' capture ICU-related information study operation study period , respectively . We administer 3 8 item questionnaire SDMs , RCs physicians involve consent encounter describe acceptance comfort satisfaction approach utilize . Study Outcomes : To demonstrate feasibility RCT evaluate 2 method approach SDMs consent research participation . Feasibility define ( ) ≤ 15 % physician introduction miss due lack physician availability ( physician introduction arm ) ( ii ) cross-overs ( either arm ) occur ≤ 15 % encounter . We demonstrate ≤ 20 % introduction ( follow randomization ) miss due inability research team contact identify SDM least 70 % 50 % initial subsequent SDM questionnaire return . Relevance : The Approach Study provide valuable information stakeholder commit ensure ethical basis critical care research ; guide design large RCT examine best approach SDMs critically ill patient . Moreover provide insight best approach SDMs make encounter comfortable , credible , informed less burdensome . The Approach Study provide framework large phase 3 study examine best approach SDMs .</detailed_description>
