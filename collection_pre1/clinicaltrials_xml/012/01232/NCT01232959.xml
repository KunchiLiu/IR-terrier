	<brief_summary>Today three different way remove gallbladder gallstone . Surgeons remove gallbladder small incision abdomen . This call laparoscopic cholecystectomy . It current standard . It replace traditional open gallbladder surgery . Open gallbladder surgery do large incision . A new way remove gallbladder woman vagina . This call transvaginal cholecystectomy . This study do see remove gallbladder vagina work patient Mayo Clinic Rochester . This first step research test procedure . In future , study examine potential less scar reduce pain . In study investigator still make small incision abdomen , small standard procedure still scar abdomen . Some early research report say patient may less pain transvaginal approach ; however , investigator know transvaginal route effect overall health quality life . This study evaluate : - Effectiveness surgery : ability remove gallbladder safely - Effect operation body : change pulse blood pressure surgery , level inflammation marker blood surgery - Recovery surgery hospital : much pain , much pain medication need , long need stay hospital , nature surgical complication ( problem ) - Overall recovery surgery : general quality life , abdominal symptom What new type surgery ? The new type surgery call transvaginal cholecystectomy : A small incision make vagina . An endoscope ( flexible light camera tube ) insert abdomen . An endoscope normally use examine stomach colon . A small camera place abdomen belly button ( 5 mm , Â¼ inch ) . This help surgeon remove gallbladder vagina . The procedure separate gallbladder body assist instrument place abdomen instrument place vagina . The surgeon remove gallbladder pass though vagina .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Transvaginal Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As technologic innovation medicine continue advance , less intrusive operative procedure develop . Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery ( NOTES ) may represent less invasive approach abdominal cavity . The access abdominal cavity natural orifice vagina benefit decrease somato-sensory innervation . This venue might confer less pain operative stress patient . The transvaginal approach suggest new surgical approach gallbladder surgery ( cholecystectomy ) . Approximately 700 transvaginal cholecystectomy procedure perform medical center around world far . Anecdotal data suggest patient experience less pain postoperatively half may require pain medication . Currently , introduction new operative approach outside research study support national international society . We wish demonstrate transvaginal approach feasible 10 patient gallstone disease Mayo Clinic Rochester ( MCR ) . Methods : Female patient see consultant Division General Gastrointestinal Surgery , appropriate indication elective cholecystectomy , offer cholecystectomy via transvaginal approach . After patient enrollment , baseline demographic , questionnaire blood draw obtain . The patient undergo laparoscopic assist transvaginal cholecystectomy dedicate surgical team , consist gynecologist , minimally invasive surgeon gastroenterologist . This approach utilize 5-mm umbilical trocar posterior colpotomy . Standard laparoscopic flexible endoscopic instrumentation utilize along recently introduce long flexible-tip laparoscopic instrumentation remove gallbladder . Intraoperative parameter record . Postoperatively blood draw questionnaire repeat specific interval . Data analysis mainly descriptive feasibility study . The collected material serve pilot data future comparative study transvaginal cholecystectomy standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy .</detailed_description>
