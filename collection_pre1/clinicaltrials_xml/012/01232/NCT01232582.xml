	<brief_summary>Chronic pain affect estimate 50 65 million individual US , incidence prevalence steadily rise correspondence increase longevity population . Spinal pain , encompass low back , thoracic neck pain , common type chronic pain greatly reduce quality life . Facet joint pain often associate facet arthropathy degenerative arthritis joint . This condition develop due progressive wear tear cause small repetitive strain joint throughout lifetime . Strain inflammation induce fluid distention joint turn result compression nerve root joint - origin chronic pain . Current treatment facet arthropathy pain include oral medication , intra-articular injection anesthetic steroid medication , energy ablation ( e.g . radiofrequency ablation ) denervation , severe case facet rhizotomy ( surgical severing nerve ) . The ExAblate magnetic resonance guide focus ultrasound system enable noninvasive focal ablation tissue . Results feasibility study , include FDA approve feasibility study ( IDE # G050177 ) show palliative effect ExAblate patient bone metastases . It reasonable assume palliative effect MRgFUS could also translate alleviation facet pain focus ultrasound beam direct facet joint . The highly-target focal ablation could also diminish risk complication often associate less selective denervation technique . The objective trial evaluate safety effectiveness ExAblate system treatment pain result facet joint osteoarthritis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , non-randomized , single-arm , phase I study evaluate safety effectiveness use ExAblate MRgFUS treatment pain result facet joint osteoarthritis . Patients chronic LBP associate one lumbar zygapophysial joint meet eligibility requirement give write informed consent enrol study . All patient treat follow 12-months post treatment . A total 50 patient enrol two clinical site . The primary objective study evaluate incidence severity adverse event associate ExAblate MRgFUS system use treatment pain result facet joint osteoarthritis</detailed_description>
