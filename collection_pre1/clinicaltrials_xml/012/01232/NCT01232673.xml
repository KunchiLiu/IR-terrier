	<brief_title>Autologous Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transfer Patients With Chronical Critical Limb Ischemia Diabetic Foot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION : The local method autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation consist harvest bone marrow iliac crest , separation use cell separator generate ABMSCs ( CD 34 positive ) subsequent multiple injection limb suffer chronic critical ischemia . The aim therapy induce angiogenesis vasculogenesis would correct ischemia hypoxia , improve tissue perfusion metabolism thus prevent limb amputation . Due correction hypoxia ischemia improvement blood supply regeneration damage tissue initiate . Improved tissue perfusion achieve large number mediator include growth angiogenic factor turn stimulate growth primitive vessel wall within ischemic tissue , part heal process . In general , reparative process could divide initial phase characterize release inflammatory mediator neurotransmitter follow phase formation primitive vascular tube compose endothelial cell precursor later adhere stabilize pericyte cell . Process angiogenesis ( sprout well nonsprouting ) take usually 4-6 week depend degree initial tissue ischemia hypoxia . Development new collateral blood flow ischemic/hypoxic tissue monitor Laser Doppler - Flowmetry , level Transcutaneous TcpO2 TcpCO2 , Toe Pressure Skin Perfusion Pressure measurement , Index Ankle-Arm ABI use Duplex Doppler Ultrasound , angiography , MRI alternatively common method use nuclear medicine . Analysis interpretation measurement define degree efficacy safety therapeutic modality may suggest future direction optimization therapy . 2 . PROJECT OBJECTIVES : Primary objective : To evaluate efficacy-safety profile autologous bone marrow stem cell ( ABMSCs ) transplantated chronically critically ischemic limb ( CLI ) diabetic foot stage IV Fontaine classification . Secondary objective : To assess effect ABMSCs tissue perfusion ischemic limb transplantation transcutaneous oximetry laser Doppler flowmetry use Periflux 5000 system normal provocation test condition . In addition , wound heal ulcer evaluate use planimetry method photograph affect skin take pre- post-transplantation . Relationship CD 34 progenitor count separate gradient-density separation centrifuge Harvest Technologies overall effectiveness safety treat ischemic limb . Priorities : Beside assessment effectiveness safety ABMSCs transplantation ultimate emphasis put avoid limb amputation . This significant socioeconomic impact . Therefore project belong priority program clinical research cardiovascular disease . METHODOLOGY AND PATIENT RECRUITMENT : A total 90 patient ( 45 patient per year ) recruit period 2 year study . Separation ABMSCs application : Concentrate autologous stem cell ( CD 34 positive ) separate bone marrow aspirate use cell separator Harvest Technologies . Bone marrow collect iliac bone shovel accord standard Yamshidi puncture aspiration methodology . During procedure patient analgosedation use propophol iv bolus physiological sign include blood pressure ( BP ) , pulse , ECG , pO2 saturation continuously monitor adjust accord need . In brief , 240 ml bone marrow aspirate aspiration set pre file ACD-A anticoagulant ( 30 ml ) hematologist process use cell separator Harvest Technologies . This equipment easy operate several advantage compare cell separator market . The methodology ( ) simple , easy , fast , safe use gradient density centrifugation separate blood element include white cell , platelet , red cell collect bone marrow centrifuge container sample 5 % hematocrit ( contain ABMSCs platelet ) within 15 minute . Thereafter 40 ml sample aspirate syringe immediately apply multiple injection ischemic limb . Whole procedure take less one hour . Monitoring quality clinical effect ABMSCs transplantation : Bone marrow examine separation ABMSCs ass number CD 34 positive progenitor well number cellular component include platelet . Prior- ( 0 days-baseline ) post transplantation ( 1 , 7 , 14 , 30 , 60 , 120 day ) patient undergo follow examination : Laser Doppler Flowmetry - assessment blood flow ; measurement transcutaneous oxygen ( TcpO2 ) CO2 ( TcpCO2 ) level without provocation test ( O2 inhalation ) . Complete battery test CBC differential , fibrinogen CPR also establish . In addition , ABI-Ankle-Brachial Index , TP-Toe Pressure , SPP-Skin Perfusion Pressure , Rutherford Fontaine Cathegory , analgetics consumption ( requirement ) , claudication interval non-amputated patient also monitor . These value collect correlated degree initial ischemia/hypoxia well change ischemia/hypoxia develop within 120 postoperative day ( 6 interval ) . 4 / EXPECTED RESULTS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT Our preliminary pilot data suggest 60 % patient suffer chronic critical limb ischemia fail common therapy , limb amputation prevent . In patient leg wound heal well within 120 day follow ABMSCs transplantation . This remarkable success compare historical control 100 % amputation , particularly ischemic leg end-stages fail therapy ( Rutherford 4-6 Fontaine IV classification ) CLI diabetic foot wound . We expect confirm result set new standard treatment condition ABMSCs transplantation Faculty Hospital Ostrava Czech Republic well . We feel new treatment significant positive socioeconomic impact patient entire Czech society . 5 / MATERIALS AND HUMAN RESOURCES 5.1 Patients include project examine interventional angiology FN Ostrava laboratory inclusion end exclusion criterion consider . They include study complete standard revascularisation ( Bypass PTA-stent leg artery ) treatment , meet criterion end-stage Fontaine - IV Rutherford 4-6 classification CLI . 5.2 Entrance examination - carry duplex doppler legs examination , measure ankle pressure , ankle-brachial index toe pressure , measurement SPP- skin perfusion pressure laser doppler measurement transcutaneous TcpO2 TcpCO2 . The patient initial angiographic examination DSA , CTA MRA ass deplete basic revascularisation treatment . 5.3 Personnel cooperation : The candidate -Vaclav Prochazka , MD , PhD , MSc coordinate patient recruitment , entry examination carry involve data collection data management . Jaromir Gumulec , MD participate bone marrow collection separation data-processing , blood sample laboratory test data management . Prof.. Peter Klement , MVDr , Ph.D. contribute ensure logistics process statistical data ensure publication presentation foreign journal . Frantisek Jaluvka , MD contribute patient hospitalisation surgical clinic , subsequent podology ambulatory care patient participate BMSC transplantatation procedure ensure desinfection sterility operate environment . Jana Chmelova , MD . participate transplantation programe procedure , data process ensure creation publication . 6 / TIME WORK PLAN During first second year 45 patient enrol ( total 90 ) . All patient treat autologous BMSC Tx monitor clinical state endpoint limb amputation wound heal donne . Hematology data separate bone marrow sample analyse examination peripheral venous blood sample laboratory data day 0,1,3,7,14,30 carry . Entire datas tissue perfusion laser doppler flow ( LDP ) , include provocation test measurement TcpO2 TcpCO2 include inhalation test appreciation tissue perfusion state evaluate . Ankle pressure ABI- index , SPP- skin perfusion pressure TP- toe pressure examine . Simultaneously dynamic leg scintigraphy 6 month procedure carry . In non-amputated patient claudication interval test Rutherford plus Fontaine stage classification count . In last 3rd year project , patient follow-up continue data file statistical evaluation management . In 1st . 2nd year , interim period report economic data assessment take 3rd year final report complete . 7 / INFORMED CONSENT Dear patient Mr/Mrs.. , You invite Your doctor therapeutic procedure autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation . You right freely decide proposed procedure ( specific legislation exclude right ) inalienable right fully inform procedure . Based Your current health status , therapeutic procedure bone marrow stem cell transplantation treatment chronical critical limb ischemia design You Your medical specialist . 8 / CONCLUSION OF THE PROJECT The project prepare publication Circulation Stem Cell Therapy journal present domestic foreign angiology , haematology vascular surgery meeting , publication abstract accompany IGA grant annotation .</detailed_description>
