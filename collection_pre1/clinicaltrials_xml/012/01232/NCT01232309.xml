	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVDs ) , especially atherosclerotic coronary heart disease stroke , leading cause death globally . Important risk factor CVDs include elevate serum level total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) -cholesterol , triglyceride , low high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) -cholesterol level . Oxidized LDL also identify risk factor CVDs . There grow need identify safe effective intervention offer clinical benefit aim reduce one risk factor CVDs . Oxidized LDL unique plaque-specific protein produce arterial wall oxidative modification apoB-100 moiety native LDL mediate reactive oxygen specie . Oxidized LDL powerful atherogenic protein , directly involve initiation progression atherosclerosis , main cause coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . It widely believe native LDL atherogenic , must convert oxidized LDL . Oxidized LDL find atherosclerotic lesion circulation , normal artery . Oxidized LDL biomarker accelerate atherosclerosis mediator atherosclerotic disease process . In 1998 , Holvoet et al demonstrate first time elevate circulating level oxidize LDL find untreated patient stable CAD acute coronary syndrome ( unstable angina ; acute myocardial infarction ) . In landmark study , oxidize LDL level measure plasma ELISA procedure use oxidized LDL-specific , murine monoclonal antibody , 4E6 . Mercodia 's commercially available oxidize LDL ELISA kit use Holvoet 's monoclonal antibody , 4E6 , specific oxidatively modified LDL . The 4E6 antibody direct conformational epitope apoprotein ( apo ) B-100 moiety LDL generate consequence aldehyde substitution lysine residues apoB-100 . Data epidemiological study show various health benefit provide dietary fiber intake , include inverse association risk CVDs . As show several well-controlled clinical trial , various water-soluble dietary fiber reduce total cholesterol LDL-cholesterol HDL-cholesterol triglyceride significantly influence . Recently , European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) authorize health claim related maintenance normal blood cholesterol concentration soluble cereal fibre , particularly beta-glucans oat barley . The beta-glucans cereal non-starch polysaccharide consist ( 1→3,1→4 ) -beta-D-linked glucose unit . Few study address potential favorable effect beta-glucans micro-organisms CVD risk factor . One clinical study examine effect yeast-derived beta-glucan , glucose polymer beta- ( 1→3,1→6 ) linkage , serum lipid 15 hypercholesterolemic obese men . At end 8-week treatment period ( 15 g fiber/day addition normal diet ) , total cholesterol level decrease whereas HDL-cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol triglyceride differ significantly baseline value . A number animal study show consumption fungi fungal extract low blood cholesterol reduce aortic atherosclerotic lesion rabbit feed high-cholesterol diet atherosclerosis-susceptible apolipoprotein E-deficient mouse feed normal . It note fungal component ( ) cause effect identify characterize ( whole mushroom impure extract test ) . Chitin-glucan natural component cell wall microscopic fungi . Chitin-glucan regard insoluble dietary fiber . In hamster feed atherogenic diet , chitin-glucan mixed food lower plasma triglyceride markedly reduce diet-induced formation aortic fatty streak lesion . It also reduce aortic cholesterol , cardiac superoxide anion production hepatic malondialdehyde , increase hepatic antioxidant enzyme activity ( glutathione peroxidase superoxide dismutase ) . Although oxidized LDL measure study , data early clinical trial indicate consumption chitin-glucan 28 day decrease circulate oxidize LDL approximately 26 % healthy , normo-cholesterolemic young male . To confirm result randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study use male female broad inclusion criterion , chitin-glucan evaluate alone ( 1.5 4.5 gram per day ) , combination olive extract ( chitin-glucan 1.5 gram per day + olive extract 135 mg per day ) . There large body evidence indicate olive oil recapitulate many beneficial effect human health , include reduce risk develop CVDs , report intake Mediterranean Diet . Numerous study perform vitro vivo conclude polyphenolic compound present extra virgin olive oil play important role prevention atherosclerotic damage inhibition LDL oxidation . Tyrosol hydroxytyrosol show dose-dependent activity regard consider potent antioxidant , demonstrate activity micromolar range . Thus , solid scientific clinical rationale evaluate chitin-glucan alone combination olive extract ability reduce oxidize LDL .</detailed_description>
