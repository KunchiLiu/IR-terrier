	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine effect add drug call hydroxychloroquine , usually use treat rheumatoid arthritis , patient ' usual antiretroviral combination . HIV cause activation part immune system immune activation may persist despite effective antiretroviral therapy . Ongoing activation may responsible poor CD4 rise antiretroviral therapy HIV-related complication . Drugs like hydroxychloroquine work inhibit immune activation . The study primarily investigate effect add medication immunological parameter ( particularly CD4 count ) , safety parameter ( cholesterol ) , patient ' side effect viral load . If decide take part , duration involvement study 24 week plus two screen visit 84 day prior start study follow visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hydroxychloroquine Discordant CD4 Responders Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies explore change antiretrovirals addition antiretrovirals new class patient discordant immune response suppressive HAART , general , yield disappointing result . The addition antiretroviral maraviroc ( CCR5 antagonist ) patient suppressive HAART least year CD4 count le 250 ( rise ) yield improvement CD4 count 6 individual approximately 5 month . A small study investigate benefit switch lopinavir/ritonavir ( predominantly NNRTI-based therapy ) show significant improvement CD4 cell count reduction cell apoptosis 6 months.However , data switch lack lopinavir/ritonavir may prefer switch option due gastrointestinal tolerability increase risk myocardial infarction cohort analysis . Chronic HIV infection characterise gradual loss CD4 T-cells direct ( virus mediate CD4 death ) indirect mechanism . Increased immune activation indirect mechanism central CD4 T-cell loss . In observational study , level immune activation associate rate CD4 decline patient take antiretroviral therapy ( without complete viral suppression ) extent CD4 recovery associate degree immune activation . Immune activation also show correlate disease progression survival . The cause generalize immune activation HIV fully understand may relate nef gp120 . Hydroxychloroquine [ PlaquanilÂ® ] license treat rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory condition ; relate antimalarial chloroquine . Hydroxychloroquine chloroquine long use immunomodulatory therapy T-cell mediate disorder . The exact mechanisms hydroxychloroquine fully understood , agent appear affect T-cell proliferation signal . Hydroxychloroquine also inhibit T-cell proliferative response production pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 IL-6 . Hydroxychloroquine chloroquine show inhibit HIV replication , regardless viral clade co-receptor tropism , promote CD4 immune protection . Three small clinical trial hydroxychloroquine report HIV-infected patient . Hydroxychloroquine associate small modest reduction viral load monotherapy part combination therapy . In one study , hydroxychloroquine compare zidovudine HIV-infected patient patient group reduce level plasma HIV-1 RNA serum p24 antigen 16 week . Interleukin-6 ( inflammatory cytokine associate increase risk mortality cohort study HIV ) level significantly reduce hydroxychloroquine group zidovudine group . The usual minimum effective dose hydroxychloroquine 400mg daily ( administer two 200mg film-coated tablet ) administer orally . This also dose select ongoing Medical Research Council study investigate immune benefit hydroxychloroquine treatment-naive patient need start antiretrovirals . Hydroxychloroquine cumulative action require several week exert beneficial effect ; rheumatic disease , treatment discontinue improvement 6 month . On basis feel 3 month sufficient time detect improvement immune activation 6 month sufficient time observe benefit occur . The maximum recommend dose hydroxychloroquine 6.5mg/kg/day .</detailed_description>
