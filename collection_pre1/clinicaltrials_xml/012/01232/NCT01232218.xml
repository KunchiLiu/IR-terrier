	<detailed_description>Current standard treatment post-stroke shoulder pain include joint protection ( i.e. , sling protective position ) stretching/strengthening exercise pain-free range . Although added movement shoulder blade move post-stroke arm recommend literature , study date find directly look impact provide synchronized three-dimensional scapular humeral movement therapy . Due integral relationship scapula humerus movement , hypothesized increase 3-dimensional shoulder blade mobility painful post-stroke shoulder contribute increase pain-free 3-dimensional arm movement . This double-blind randomized-controlled study aim investigate effectiveness 3-D approach address post-stroke shoulder pain .</detailed_description>
