	<detailed_description>MTN-007 Phase 1 , randomize , blind , placebo-controlled safety acceptability study vaginally formulate tenofovir 1 % gel ( reduced-glycerin formulation ) , apply rectally . The primary objective study assess safety vaginally formulate tenofovir 1 % gel apply rectally . This study also determine whether rectal use tenofovir 1 % gel associate rectal mucosal damage use broad range immunological safety biomarkers , utilize N-9 positive control , rectal application N-9 know cause mild transient mucosal damage . Other secondary objective include evaluation acceptability rectal administration tenofovir 1 % gel well safety HEC placebo gel apply rectally . Participants randomize receive single dose tenofovir 1 % gel , 2 % N-9 gel placebo gel apply clinician study site . The study also include treatment arm . There 15 participant arm . Participants return clinic , self-administer single dose study gel observation . Within approximately 30 minute , lavage , stool , rectal biopsy specimen obtain . After one-week recovery period , participant return clinic assessment . If significant adverse event ( AEs ) report begin self-administer once-daily outpatient dos study gel 7 day . Participants return clinic evaluation specimen collection completion 7 day daily dose . Receptive anal intercourse common among men sex men increase evidence heterosexual woman develop develop world also practice anal sex . It therefore anticipate vaginal microbicides license , use vaginal rectal compartment . As consequence , need evaluate rectal vaginal safety profile candidate microbicides . The Rectal Microbicide Program clinical protocol therefore develop assess safety pharmacology tenofovir 1 % gel use rectally men woman well address critical question regard rectal microbicides exploratory objective .</detailed_description>
