	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction : The objective study identify candidate clinical predictor fetomaternal hemorrhage ( FMH ) devise screen strategy identify pregnancy affect condition fetus compromise severe anemia . Fetomaternal hemorrhage condition placental barrier fail fetus `` bleeds '' maternal circulation . When function correctly , placenta allows transfer nutrient waste mother fetus keep cellular component blood separate . It uncommon small amount fetal blood reach maternal circulation without adverse effect fetus . In fact , mild FMH detect 75 % normal pregnancy . In approximately 3 1000 pregnancy , however , volume fetal blood transfer mother cause clinically-significant anemia fetus . Fetal anemia cause significant morbidity mortality . In fetus survive severe anemia , life-long disability common . Diagnosis FMH commonly make adverse fetal neonatal outcome occur , indicate need test . Early risk factor FMH unknown . Clinical predictor FMH suggest , bear retrospective study . Current standard care test FMH , Kleihauer-Betke ( KB ) acid elution test , labor-intensive time-consuming , therefore expensive . Additionally , KB test observer-dependent significantly affect variation sample preparation . No screen protocol FMH automate laboratory test appropriate use general pregnant population exists . Specific Aim : To identify appropriate laboratory protocol diagnosis fetomaternal hemorrhage prospective study pilot study intend determine early clinical predictor mild fetomaternal hemorrhage . 2 . Background Significance Fetomaternal hemorrhage occur normal flow blood within placenta disrupt cellular component fetal blood cross maternal circulation . A healthy placenta permit transfer dissolved substance mother fetus keep cellular component two circulation separate . It common placental filter `` leak '' normal pregnancy , result transfer small volume fetal whole blood maternal bloodstream . Volumes fetal blood 1 mL detect 75 % pregnancy . This volume blood loss think clinically insignificant fetus . Severe FMH large volume blood transfer fetus mother less common . Although exact volume blood transfer need classify FMH `` severe '' debate , clear significant acute chronic hemorrhage lead adverse perinatal outcome . Estimates incidence severe FMH vary , primarily comprehensive epidemiologic study condition exist . Estimates base screen Rh alloimmunization Rho ( ) negative woman suggest severe FMH occur 1-3 1000 pregnancy , , account almost 14 % otherwise unexplained fetal death . Large volume FMH result severe fetal anemia . Although fetal anemia manifest utero recognize hydrops fetalis intrauterine growth restriction , commonly outward sign FMH-related severe anemia stillbirth , fetal distress delivery , neonatal critical illness . The immediate sequela severe FMH neonate survive delivery include devastate illness persistence fetal circulation , hypovolemic shock , hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy . Ultimate detrimental outcome include high rate mental retardation , cerebral palsy , neurologic devastation , death . Despite consequence , suspect recent rise incidence severe FMH , early predictor severe FMH remain unknown cause hemorrhage identify 80 % case . Maternal pregnancy risk factor appropriate early screening diagnosis severe FMH general pregnant population elucidate . , If identify prior delivery , fetal anemia FMH successfully manage intrauterine fetal transfusion delivery prior onset labor . , Outcomes follow treatment fetal anemia fetal transfusion , even repeat fetal transfusion , encourage . Thus , empirical predictor FMH would offer immediate promise improve clinical outcome . The social financial cost initial intensive care long-term chronic care child cognitive motor disability result FMH substantial . There considerable need early risk identification practical screening strategy mitigate human economic cost severe FMH . Validated clinical predictor FMH include decreased fetal movement , sinusoidal fetal heart rate tracing , hydrops fetalis . , These marker useful prevention adverse event stem FMH signifies establish severe fetal anemia . Maternal characteristic purport increase risk FMH include hypertension , placental abruption , substance abuse , trauma . These evaluate retrospective study stillbirth 1999 study . None significantly associate FMH . Clinical characteristic suspect association FMH evaluate 2004 study Rho ( ) -negative woman . Only twin gestation significantly associate FMH . It unknown whether incidence FMH multiple gestation higher singleton pregnancy . No prospective retrospective epidemiologic survey FMH general pregnant population publish . No epidemiologic description spectrum ( mild , moderate , severe ) FMH exist . No series placental pathology drawn case FMH complete . Currently , even at-risk pregnancy worthy screen identify prior devastate outcome , laboratory test FMH straightforward . The commonly used laboratory test detect quantify volume fetal blood maternal circulation Kleihauer-Betke ( KB ) acid elution test . The reagent KB test relatively inexpensive , test operator-dependent labor-intensive make unappealing candidate use expand screening . The test base fact acid eluent lyse fragile maternal erythrocyte fetal hemoglobin stabilize fetal erythrocyte . Maternal blood obtain exposed acid eluent . Remaining intact fetal cell stain count . Estimates maternal fetal total blood volume use calculate volume FMH . The KB test influence sample handling , technician-dependent , inaccurate patient blood volume blood count similar standard estimate use . It hypothesize use maternal height weight estimate maternal blood volume individual test improve accuracy KB testing . This method widely practice validated general pregnant population . Such `` correct KB '' warrant examination . An additional test explore avoid pitfall KB test evaluation maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP ) level . The concentration fetal-derived AFP maternal circulation use estimate volume FMH . As AFP level vary across pregnancy , however , AFP test useful multiple level obtain course pregnancy compare . The vast majority pregnant woman United States undergo AFP test second trimester part `` quad '' `` triple '' screen test fetal aneuploidy neural tube defect . Although theoretically viable , publish report document use second-trimester AFP baseline level detect FMH follow additional AFP test close term . The accurate measurement FMH develop date achieve flow cytometry ( FC ) use antibody specific hemoglobin fetal cell . Cells must make permeable chemically permit exposure FC antibody intracellular hemoglobin prior analysis . Additionally , FC use monoclonal antibody fetal hemoglobin document reliably diagnose FMH &gt; 0.1 % general clinical population . This less sensitive KB test perform standard clinical condition . Finally , currently practice , FC use antibody fetal hemoglobin time-consuming expensive . This test therefore appropriate large-scale screening time . No series placental pathology relate FMH publish . As FMH think disease placental failure , systematic review placenta pregnancy affect FMH could illuminate pathogenesis type placental abnormality . Fetomaternal hemorrhage under-studied disease entity significant associate morbidity mortality . This study aim identify early clinical predictor disease develop automated screen strategy appropriate wide-spread use . Standard epidemiologic technique use combination adaptation exist laboratory technique fully address problem . 4 . Methods : To address Specific Aims , propose ( 1 ) test automate laboratory testing procedure FMH ( 2 ) pilot protocol use novel automate laboratory test procedure identify neonate-mother pair affect FMH identification early clinical predictor FMH . This pilot prospective nest case-control study . In collaboration Red Cell Physiology laboratory New York Blood Center , develop prototype automate assay FMH use flow cytometry facility reagent available New York Blood Center . A convenience sample woman admit Mount Sinai Medical Center labor floor select pilot study . Eligible woman admit term delivery ( delivery 37 0/7 41 6/7 week last menstrual period ) . Mothers carry fetus know fetal anomaly exclude . Women pre-eclampsia anomaly placental implantation ( accreta , abruption ) include , condition may place pregnancy risk FMH currently indicate pregnancy surveillance fetal anemia . Multiple gestation include . Women unable complete consent process due likely precipitous delivery , severe labor discomfort , fetal distress require immediate obstetric intervention exclude . Each woman enrol study prior require antepartum blood draw and/or IV placement , study blood specimen obtain clinically indicated phlebotomy . Study specimens bank batch test pregnancy interest . Not woman donate blood part study blood test sign FMH . Although 5mL blood drawn eligible consent woman prior delivery , specimens select stratified sample population base neonatal hematocrit ( HCT ) test . All maternal blood drawn fix and/or frozen immediately phlebotomy later batch analysis . Eligible neonate consent mother 0.5mL ( approximately 3 drop ) blood collect determination hematocrit time require blood draw New York State Newborn Screening Program day two life . Eligibility determine absence clinical history FMH explain neonatal anemia . Clinical indicator anemia unrelated FMH treat exclusion criterion include hemolytic disease ( due know Rh , Kell , etc sensitization , Coombs test positive ) , know significant cord compression time delivery ( prolapse cord , tight cord around neck body ) , twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome recognize anemia donor twin polycythemia recipient twin , know neonatal blood loss ( unclamped cord , laceration ) . Neonates hematocrit measure within first 48 hour life clinical indication additional blood drawn study ; result clinically-indicated sample use . All newborn enrol mother HCT test . All mother-baby pair demonstrate neonatal anemia ( HCT ≤ 50 % ) include pilot cohort . In case multiple gestation , sibling include analysis demonstrate anemia . Twenty-five percent neonate HCT 50 % also include pilot cohort ( every fourth study subject HCT &gt; 50 % ) . This sample strategy allow evaluation spectrum newborn blood count , over-representing anemia . Maternal blood study cohort subject undergo multiple test FMH include FC , AFP , KB . Flow cytometry perform New York Blood Center . Determination AFP level KB test perform Mount Sinai Hospital laboratory . Maternal blood sample appropriately fixed time collection , frozen batch test weekly . Any clinically-indicated testing FMH perform independently blood specimen obtain post-partum , include analysis . All available first trimester AFP test result obtain cohort mother . Anthropometric data gather correct test result estimate maternal blood volume base maternal height weight . Accuracy various test method predict volume fetal blood maternal circulation determine comparison KB specimens correct actual rather estimate maternal blood volume . All placenta study subject fix hold pathology laboratory standard one-week duration post-partum . Thirty pregnancy choose stratify sample base severity FMH pregnancy placenta ( ) subject full pathologic exam . Standard examination technique include gross microscopic exam use . After study cohort mother identify , collect medical , social , environmental , full pregnancy history via direct interview . Elements particular interest include hypothesize literature associate FMH . Factors suspect literature associate FMH include maternal hypertension pregnancy , maternal pre-eclampsia , maternal trauma pregnancy , placental abruption , multiple gestation . The survey tool investigate element maternal history well take broad survey environmental social history attempt identify unrecognized clinical predictor FMH . Maternal subject interview post-partum stay hospital . Data use identification early risk factor FMH . Risk factor identify logistic regression model multilevel outcome FMH cod absent ( referent ) , mild , severe , generate separate odds ratio mild severe FMH . The alternate laboratory approach identification FMH compare examine agreement use kappa statistic , quantify agreement across category .</detailed_description>
