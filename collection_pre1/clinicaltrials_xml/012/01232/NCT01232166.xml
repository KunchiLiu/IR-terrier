	<brief_summary>Background : Endotracheal intubation become well establish standard protect airway surgical procedure , emergency situation . Serious complication occur incorrect placement endotracheal tube mainstem bronchus . If unrecognized lead hypoxemia secondary atelectasis unventilated lung hyperinflation intubate lung , result barotrauma . As bedside method golden standard verify correct endotracheal tube placement bilateral ausculation chest . However always satisfactory , breath sound transmit opposite side chest spite endobronchial intubation . Therefore clinical test verify correct endotracheal tube placement become part daily clinical practice , like observation symmetric chest movement , use cm marking print endotracheal tube . However far study investigate bedside clinical method work best detect inadvertently place endobronchial tube adult . We therefore design study compare three different bedside method verify endotracheal endobronchial tube placement . Objective : To determine four commonly use bedside method detect inadvertent endobronchial intubation adult high sensitivity specificity . Design : Prospective randomized , blind study . Setting : Tertiary , academic hospital , department anaesthesia . Participants : 160 consecutive ASA I II patient , age 19-75 year , schedule elective gynaecological urological surgery . Interventions : Patients randomly assign eight study group . In four group , endotracheal tube ( ETT ) fiberoptically position 2.5-4.0 cm carina , whereas four group tube position right mainstem bronchus . The four group differ bedside test use verify position endotracheal tube . First-year resident experienced anaesthesiologists independently perform one follow randomly assign bedside test patient effort determine whether tube properly position trachea : 1 ) bilateral auscultation chest ( Auscultation ) ; 2 ) observation palpation symmetric chest movement ( Observation ) ; 3 ) estimate position ETT insertion depth ( Tube Depth ) ; , 4 ) combination three mention test ( All Three ) . Main outcome measure : Correct incorrect judgement endotracheal tube ( ETT ) position independently assess first-year anaesthesia resident experience anaesthesiologists four bedside test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>ASA I II patient , age 1975 year , schedule elective gynaecological urological surgery need endotracheal intubation . Preexisting lung disease , pleural effusion , anticipate difficult airway , know endobronchial tracheal lesion , patient risk aspiration gastric content .</criteria>
