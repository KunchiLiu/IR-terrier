	<brief_summary>1 . Purpose : To explore use L-Carnitine , pharmaceutical product , treatment fatigue person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . 2 . Hypothesis : Similar previous research disable age population , investigator hypothesize treatment L-Carnitine result significant improvement clinical fatigue spinal cord injury client , effect decrease Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ) 0.5 point . The investigator expect see effect approximately three week treatment . As secondary outcome , investigator expect see positive change Centre Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale ( CES-D ) Visual Analogue Fatigue ( VAS-F ) Visual Analogue Pain ( VAS-P ) score , due combination previously demonstrate effect L-Carnitine directly pain depression , effect potential decrease fatigue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects L-carnitine Fatigue Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-concurrent , multiple baseline single subject research design . This pilot study treat 4 SCI subject L-Carnitine , track progress fatigue prior , follow treatment . The target population include ASIA A , B C-level SCI subject least one year post SCI , clinically significant fatigue ability provide consent , age 19 65 year . SCI subject old 65 year age exclude due previous research effect L-Carnitine healthy age population . As L-Carnitine show positive effect various effect age , old subject exclude avoid potentially confounding effect . Subjects SCI ASIA A , B C injury identify outpatient list GF Strong Rehab Centre . Subjects initially contact letter ( letter attach ) . In addition , recruitment poster post ( poster attach ) . The research coordinator follow-up telephone answer question provide information study , obtain verbal consent . Given verbal consent , research coordinator screen potential subject clinically significant fatigue orally administer Fatigue Severity Scale . Subjects require average score 4 question qualify . Treatment consist use 1980 milligrams daily L-Carnitine period 4 week ( three 330 mg tablet morning three 330 mg tablet even ) . The study multiple baseline single subject research design 4 subject . Subjects randomly assign different baseline length . Subjects require 4 study visit interview . In addition , subject require complete daily adverse event log self-reported bi-weekly outcome measure duration study . The duration study vary 10 13 week . At least 5 baseline measurement take subject prior start treatment L-Carnitine . Each subsequent subject progressively longer baseline period prior start treatment final subject 12 baseline measurement . The 4 study visit interview occur enrollment ( t=0 week ) , commencement L-Carnitine treatment ( t=3 , 4 , 5 6 week ) , cessation L-Carnitine treatment ( t=7 , 8 , 9 10 week ) , cessation post-treatment follow-up ( t=10 , 11 , 12 13 week ) . The interview include administration Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form ( SF-36 ) Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) tool , measurement weight Orthostatic Hypotension ( OH ) , review change subject 's medication access medical service prior start study and/or since last assessment . The SF-36 BPI validate SCI population . The SF-36 widely use measure health-related quality life . One domains address energy &amp; vitality , would describe effect L-Carnitine individual . The BPI measure pain interference , adapt disabled population . Its use validate data bi-weekly patient self-reports pain level , detail . OH define decrease systolic blood pressure 20 mmHg , diastolic blood pressure 10 mmHg , within 3 minute sit supine position . OH show correlated fatigue . Weight fluctuation may occur due treatment , L-Carnitine show increase muscle mass muscular energy . If effect dramatic population , may positive negative condition future treatment fatigue L-Carnitine . During initial interview , follow data also collect : demographic information ( include age , sex , level education , marital status , vocational status , cause injury , level injury , completeness injury- ASIA impairment classification , medication list ) Functional Co-Morbidity Index Fatigue FCMI-F ( include condition may contribute affect fatigue anemia , sleep disorder , etc ) record . FCMI-F information obtain PI chart review , G.F. Strong electronic record , fail two , subject ' attend physician . Bi-weekly , subject complete Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ) , Centre Epidemiologic Studies Depression 10-question Scale ( CES-D ) , Visual-Analog Scale Pain ( VAS-P ) , patient fatigue self-report scale ( Visual-Analog Scale Fatigue , VAS-F ) . Measurements take Mondays Fridays morning . All tool use researcher previous study previously validate SCI population . A log document adverse effect complete daily treatment . Subjects provide lined paper explanatory letter ( attach ) detail request information effect log , could include provocation , quality , severity , time duration effect . On day without adverse effect , subject log `` adverse effect '' . These biweekly evaluation commence 3 , 4 , 5 6 week L-Carnitine treatment , progress throughout 4 week treatment , continue 3 week follow cessation treatment . The research coordinator contact subject telephone establish day week ensure compliance . All bi-weekly data mail research lab GF Strong within day completion remove bias subsequent data . Subjects provide pre-paid envelope .</detailed_description>
