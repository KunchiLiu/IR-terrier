	<brief_summary>Background : - Bone marrow stem cell , find bone marrow blood stream , collect transplant treat variety type cancer process know hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . When stem cell take one person , commonly sibling family member , give another person , refer allogeneic HSCT . Allogeneic HSCT proven especially effective treatment patient type cancer blood ( leukemia ) certain solid tumor . The transplanted stem cell travel patient 's bone marrow begin produce normal blood cell , also attack patient cancer cell . - Because allogenic HSCT always prevent cancer returning , researcher interest determine whether another type immune cell take stem cell donor white blood cell , call `` natural killer '' ( NK ) cell , give addition HSCT help fight tumor . In laboratory , NK cell show kill tumor cell , yet know occur give patient HSCT . Objectives : - To determine safety , effectiveness , immune system response give NK white blood cell individual receive allogeneic HSCT . - To identify possible side effect treatment . Eligibility : - Donors : Stem cell donor whose blood match one recipient six six HLA ( blood immune marker ) type . The donor may identical twin recipient . - Recipients : Individuals 4 35 year age diagnose pediatric solid tumor respond standard treatment , individual 4 18 year age diagnose leukemia respond standard treatment . - Other eligibility requirement include physical exam blood laboratory evaluation include make sure safe donor donate recipient undergo transplant procedure . Design : - Donors recipient screen full medical history physical examination , provide blood urine sample ; recipient tumor image study test require researcher . - Donors : - Participants receive filgrastim injection ( stimulate bone marrow ) 1 week make stem cell travel bone marrow blood . - Participants provide stem cell NK cell apheresis . - Recipients : - Participants three cycle chemotherapy treat underlying cancer weaken immune system accept donor cell . - Participants receive preparative chemotherapy transplant two day last dose chemotherapy , participant allogenic HSCT use donated stem cell . - Participants receive infusion NK cell day 7 35 HSCT . - Participants remain hospital monitoring HSCT NK cell treatment , follow closely outpatient first 6 month transplant less frequently least 5 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study NK Cell Infusion Following Allogeneic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation From Related Matched Unrelated Donors Pediatric Patients With Solid Tumors Leukemias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - Despite progress pediatric oncology , patient subset hematologic malignancy pediatric solid tumor continue experience extremely poor overall survival . Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ( HSCT ) effective high-risk hematologic malignancy . - Allogeneic HSCT perform safely patient population , disease recurrence common new approach enhance antitumor effect therapy need . NK mediate kill appear confer improved outcome HSCT patient AML ALL , NK cell infusion induce complete remission patient AML . - Preclinical data demonstrates activate NK cell readily kill pediatric solid tumor leukemias , large number activate NK cell generate ex vivo use artificial APCs post-transplant period may favorable expansion survival adoptively transfer NK cell . Objectives -Primary objective 1 ) ass feasibility toxicity infuse escalate dos donor-derived activated NK cell donor lymphocyte infusion ( NK-DLI ) Days 7 plus minus 2 day 49 plus minus 7 day follow HLA-matched T cell deplete ( TCD ) PBSCT patient metastatic recurrent pediatric solid tumor high risk leukemia unrelated donor related donor ; 2 ) determine patient treat manner experience rapid , sustain donor engraftment acceptable rate aGVHD ( less 25 % incidence grade III grade IV ) . -Secondary objective assess DFS OS patient treat study , incidence cGVHD viral infection , evaluate biologic correlate NK expansion NK activity . Eligibility -Patients 4-35 year hematologic malignancy ( e.g. , ALL , AML , CML , HD , NHL ) , 5/6 6/6 HLA-matched related 9/10 10/10 HLA match unrelated donor . Design - Pre-transplant disease specific immune deplete chemotherapy preparative regimen use previously 02-C-0259 01-C-0125 , patient undergo reduced intensity transplant . - For patient ALL AML , myeloblative regimen base current COG standard-of- care preparative regimen also include . - Donors undergo 1-3 apheresis session filgrastim mobilize PBSC . This product T cell NK cell deplete prior cryopreservation . NK cell select product use ex vivo activation expansion use KT64.4-BBL artificial antigen present cell . - A phase 1 cell dose escalation donor derive NK-DLI perform use 3 dose level ( 1 x 105 , 1 x 106 1 x 107 NK cells/kg ) infuse day 21 less 3 post-PBSCT second infusion day 49 less 7 post-PBSCT . - Three patient enrol dose level , cohort expand 6 dose-limiting toxicity occur . An expand group 12 patient treated high dose level tolerate .</detailed_description>
