	<brief_title>Efficacy Monthly Ibandronate Women With RA Reduced Bone Mineral Density Receiving Long-term Steroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glucocorticoid therapy associate number significant side effect , bone loss result glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis increase fracture risk serious . However study show many patient treated glucocorticoid receive treatment prevent bone loss . There exist 5 large randomize control clinical trial provide evidence bisphosphonates etidronate , alendronate , risedronate effective prevention treatment glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis . Significant increase BMD bisphosphonate treatment , consistently observe lumbar spine , see patient many different glucocorticoid-treated disorder ; often RA polymyalgia rheumatica , occur generally irrespective patient age , sex menopausal status woman . In addition , statically significant reduction absolute risk relative risk incident radiographic vertebral fracture demonstrate 1 year treatment risedronate . A similar significant reduction risk incident radiographic vertebral fracture see alendronate treated patient complete 2 year study alendronate prevention treatment glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis . There exist data Ibandronate report intermittent intravenous ibandronate reduce vertebral fracture risk corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis . However , report oral monthly ibandronate . Current oral bisphosphonates , give either daily weekly , associated stringent , inconvenient dosing schedule . Less frequent dosing may provide great acceptability . The objective study investigate efficacy oral monthly ibandronate woman receive long-term glucocorticoid .</detailed_description>
