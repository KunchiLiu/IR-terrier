	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether etanercept withdrawn successfully ( i.e . occurrence flare ) juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) patient disease remission reach . Goals : 1. investigate randomize control trial : - proportion JIA patient remission successfully discontinue etanercept compare JIA patient remission continue etanercept ; - time remission etanercept important factor retain remission discontinuation etanercept . 2. investigate alle JIA patient discontinue etanercept ( include control group ) : - predicting factor ( patient disease characteristic , include time remission , MRP8/MRP14 ) successfully discontinuation etanercept ; - disease course discontinuation etanercept ( time flare ) effect restart etanercept flare .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Withdrawal Etanercept After Successful Treatment Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis ( JIA ) common cause chronic arthritis child . Etanercept proven effective treatment JIA . Considering risk occurrence long-term side-effects prevent burden weekly injection cost , logical step discontinue etanercept reach remission ( disease activity least six month ) . Especially since concern long-term effect suppress immune system etanercept . However , little know successful discontinuation possible stop . Risk disease might flare ( reactivate ) . For study , JIA patient remission select ABC-register ( observational study include Dutch JIA patient use etanercept ) . Eligible patient randomize stop etanercept continue another 9 month . Patients follow standard visit evaluate disease activity 12 month discontinuation etanercept . In case disease flare etanercept therapy reintroduce immediately patient treat accord insight treat physician . Expected JIA patient remission 12 month discontinuation well chance retain remission .</detailed_description>
