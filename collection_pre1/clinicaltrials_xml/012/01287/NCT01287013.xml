	<brief_summary>Background : - Procedures use medical tool near possible abnormality body often use compute tomography ( CT ) scan locate abnormality guide path needle take collect sample tissue . Xperguide electromagnetic ( EM ) track two new procedure study help guide needle . Xperguide software use CT image help doctor choose needle path . EM track us special medical tool miniature coil act like GPS device show location needle body . Xperguide EM track use human good result , compare regular CT determine whether good standard approach . Objectives : - To compare result Xperguide , electromagnetic tracking , regular compute tomography guide percutaneous procedure . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age require CT-guided percutaneous procedure . Design : - Participants screen physical examination medical history , result previous image study examine study enrollment . - After pilot phase , study involve two phase compare result different procedure . The first phase involve compare Xperguide CT , second involve compare Xperguide EM track . - Phase 1 participant assign one two procedure group : Group 1 Xperguide , Group 2 regular CT . Participants schedule repeated procedure ( like biopsy chemotherapy ) randomize first procedure second procedure do use method . - Phase 2 participant assign one two procedure group : Group 1 Xperguide , Group 2 EM track . Participants schedule repeated procedure ( like biopsy chemotherapy ) randomize first procedure second procedure do use method . - Standard post-procedure followup care give study procedure complete .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Navigation With Xperguide vs. Electromagnetic Tracking v . Conventional Methods During Percutaneous Image Guided Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PR ( SqrRoot ) CIS This phase II prospective randomize trial compare novel navigation method , Xperguide conventional CT electromagnetic tracking ( EM ) percutaneous image guide procedure . Xperguide navigation tool utilizes cone beam CT ( CBCT ) obtain angiography suite overlaid fluoroscopy needle guidance image guide procedure . The needle entry point path plan CBCT determine path overlaid fluoroscopy image real time guidance . SPECIFIC AIMS/OBJECTIVES 1 . The primary aim : . Pilot trial : . To familiarize operator outcome measure allow fair comparison subsequent study b . Main trial 2 phase similar outcome criterion aim ( ) : i. compare Xperguide conventional imaging ( superiority design ) : ii . compare Xperguide EM tracking ( equivalence design ) : 1 . To compare accuracy final device tip position path ( vector ) 2 . To compare number reposition maneuver 3 . To compare radiation dose 4 . To compare rate definitive pathological diagnosis response rate per EASL criterion ablation METHODS/METHODOLOGY For non-vascular image guide intervention , patient undergo biopsy ablation procedure require CT guidance eligible inclusion randomization . An initial pilot study do operator perform least 5 case use Xperguide complete case report form . This ensure experience outcome measure fair comparison subsequent study . Once one operator reach minimal require case , main trial begin operator . However every operator must complete minimal number case case report form enroll patient main trial . Initially , compare Xperguide conventional CT several cohort patient mainly : lung biopsy , ablation , kidney biopsies/ablations abdominal biopsies/ ablation . In ablation large lesion , Xperguide composite ablation software provide input expect ablation zone . Each probe position manner biopsy needle follow step describe section 4 . If specific composite ablation module software commercially release FDA clear time study , software use protocol help physician determine ideal needle position complete ablation . Once consent obtain participant randomize either conventional imaging Xperguide . In addition , know patient participate trial require repeat ( pair , pre post treatment ) procedure site , randomization determine modality use guidance first visit modality automatically use second procedure . In case , patient give consent randomize one two category : 1 . Xperguide initial procedure conventional CT 2nd procedure 2 . Conventional CT initial procedure Xperguide 2nd procedure Then second phase trial , Xperguide compare EM track biopsy ablation require CT guidance , equivalence study . Once consent obtain , participant randomize EM track Xperguide . The patient would divide different cohort depend anatomic site intervention i.e . lung , kidney , liver abdomen . If patient participate trial require pair procedure ( i.e . pre post treatment ) , randomization determine modality use initial procedure modality use second procedure . In summary two potential category : 1 . EM track initial procedure Xperguide 2nd procedure 2 . Xperguide initial procedure EM track 2nd procedure If patient lesion visible PET-CT/MR , demonstrate heterogenous PET-CT/MR uptake , separate cohort PET-CT/MR guide biopsy ablation use Xperguide v EM tracking . There also need cohort ablation complimentary use ultrasound discretion operator order conform standard care NIH . ELIGIBILITY Subjects eligible : 1. 18 year age 2. schedule image guide procedure 3. lesion superficial ( deeper 3cm ) Subjects exclude : 1. alter mental status precludes understand consent procedure 2. unable hold reasonably still procedure table length procedure 3. unable hold breath procedure perform conscious sedation without general anesthesia 4. gross body weight 375 pound upper limit CT angiography table REQUIRED SAMPLE SIZE A pilot study perform ensure operator experience Xperguide EM tracking , fair comparison . In pilot study operator must perform 5 case Xperguide complete case report form . There 5 potential operator therefore maximum 25 patient ( 5 operator participate full ) . The first phase main trial compare Xperguide conventional CT power ( sample size ) standard superiority design aim statistically establish Xperguide good conventional CT ( define require few needle repositioning effort ) . These calculation yield total sample size 60 patient 20 patient per anatomical site . For second phase trial compare Xperguide EM track , two side equivalence design ( base accuracy number needle reposition ) use sample size consideration , yield 192 patient . Therefore 16 patient per modality per anatomical site randomize two additional cohort PET-CT/MR procedure composite ablation . Number Participants : 277 Recruitment Time Frame : 4 year Number sit : 1 Type Study : prospective randomize clinical trial initial pilot period</detailed_description>
