	<brief_title>Oral OKT3 Treatment Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) chronic disease unknown etiology characterize infiltration inflammatory cell intestinal tract . OKT3 approve drug intravenous use treatment solid-organ transplantation . However , intravenous dose limited significant toxicity . Data animal model suggest anti-CD3 administered via oral route effective treat variety autoimmune disease . No side effect observe recent phase I study healthy subject receive oral anti-CD3 mAb . The objective current study ass safety , immunologic effect efficacy short-term oral administration OKT3 patient active ulcerative colitis . OKT3 deliver orally 1 mg 2 mg dose Omeprazole 20 mg daily 30 consecutive day open-label pilot trial . Thirty two subject screen targeted completion 16 enrol patient . The subject evaluate baseline , day 1 , day 2 , week 1 , week 3 , well completion therapy week 5 10 initiation treatment . Lab test perform screening , baseline , day 2 , week 1 , week 3 , week 5 week 10 . Clinical data collect study visit via diary entry throughout study period . A flexible sigmoidoscopy do baseline week 5 . Stool study perform screen rule infection . To eligible study , subject must age 18 65 year history moderately severely active UC define Mayo score 6 12 . They may take concurrent biologic immunomodulator therapy UC .</detailed_description>
