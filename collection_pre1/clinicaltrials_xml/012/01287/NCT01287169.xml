	<brief_summary>We intend conduct pilot study design measure BPA level occupational exposure thermal paper use cash register . We recruit cashier local commercial store currently still use BPA-laden thermal paper plan switch BPA-free paper near future . The study use within-subject comparison design , use serum urine sample determine whether BPA detectable study population sufficient level measure difference pair sample . Two phase sample collection propose : Phase I - collect paired sample two separate occasion implementation BPA-free thermal paper use cash register ; Phase II - collecting paired sample two separate occasion implementation change thermal paper .</brief_summary>
