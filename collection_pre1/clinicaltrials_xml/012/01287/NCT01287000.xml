	<brief_summary>Background : - There little research long-term health effect oil spill , even though least 10 percent oil tanker spill 1970 2009 affect coastal population . The Deepwater Horizon disaster , release approximately 5 million barrel ( ~680,000 ton ) crude oil Gulf Mexico , far large individual tanker spill . Given magnitude spill scope potential exposure , include 55,000 worker involve clean-up effort countless resident affect area , researcher interest monitor Gulf clean-up worker understand adverse consequence oil spill general . - The Gulf Long-term Follow-up Study investigate health effect associate clean-up activity follow Deepwater Horizon disaster Gulf Mexico April 20 , 2010 . More 100,000 person complete safety train preparation participation clean-up activity relate spill . Many individual participate active clean-up effort , others . Exposures among person involve clean-up range negligible potentially significant , especially worker involve task associate direct exposure crude burn oil , chemical dispersants . However , prediction adverse health effect possible long-term human health consequence oil spill largely unknown . In addition oil , widespread economic lifestyle disruption cause oil spill may contribute mental health problem among population . Objectives : - To investigate potential short- long-term health effect associate clean-up activity exposures surround Deepwater Horizon oil spill . Eligibility : - English- , Spanish- , Vietnamese-speaking worker volunteer least 21 year age engage potentially engage oil spill clean-up operation Gulf Mexico , live affected area ( Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , Florida coastal region ) . Design : - Participants divide group perform oil-spill clean-up-related work ( expose ) engage clean-up-related work ( unexposed control ) . - Participants screen full medical history physical examination , well interview determine nature potential exposure . - Participants provide blood , hair , toenail , urine , saliva ( spit ) sample . Participants may also lung function exam . - Participants researcher collect dust home use wipe special vacuum bag . - Participants also provide detailed contact information , include Social Security number , contacted future long-term health follow-up appointment . These appointment include 30-minute telephone interview every 2 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Gulf Long-term Follow-up Study ( GuLF STUDY ) investigate potential short- long-term health effect associate clean-up activity follow Deepwater Horizon disaster Gulf Mexico April 20 , 2010 . Crude oil , burn oil , dispersants use clean-up effort contain range know suspected toxin . Over 100,000 person complete safety train preparation participation clean-up activity relate spill . While many individual participate active clean-up effort , others . Exposures among person involve clean-up range negligible potentially significant , especially worker involve task associate direct exposure crude burn oil , chemical dispersants . However , prediction adverse health effect possible long-term human health consequence oil spill largely unknown due dearth research area . The potential health effect associate level exposure experience clean-up worker largely unstudied . Heat stress experience worker may also adverse long-term health effect . In addition oil , widespread economic lifestyle disruption cause oil spill may contribute mental health problem among population . The over-arching hypothesis study : 1 . Exposure constituent oil , dispersants , oil-dispersant mixture , spill-related stress worker engage clean-up Deepwater Horizon oil spill associate adverse health effect , particularly respiratory , neurological , hematologic , psychological mental health . 2 . There exposure-response relationship exposures health effect . 3 . Biomarkers potentially adverse biologic effect associate exposure . Based known individual involve clean-up effort , cohort consist primarily English- , Spanish- , Vietnamese-speaking adult perform oil-spill clean-up-related work ( expose ) similar person engage clean-up-related work ( unexposed control ) . Accommodations enrol participant speak language develop community collaboration appropriate . Workers sample across job/potential exposure group . A total approximately 55,000 person expect enrolled cohort . A random sample full cohort , stratify category job/potential exposure ( include N~6,000 oil-spill work serve control ) oversampled worker higher potential exposure , enrol Active Follow-up Sub-cohort ( N~20,000 ) . A random sample Active Follow-up Sub-cohort , also stratify category job/potential exposure oversampled worker higher potential exposure , enrol Biomedical Surveillance Sub-cohort ( N~5,000 ) . Participants interview clean-up-related task , demographic socioeconomic factor , occupational health history , psychosocial factor , physical mental health . Members Active Follow-up Sub-cohort also ask provide biological sample ( blood , urine , hair , toenail clipping , possibly saliva ) environmental sample ( house dust ) basic clinical measurement ( height , weight , waist hip circumference , blood pressure , urinary glucose level , FEV1 FVC measure pulmonary function ) take home visit baseline . The Biomedical Surveillance Sub-cohort participate comprehensive clinical assessment initial home visit , include comprehensive pulmonary function testing , neurological testing , collection additional biological environmental sample . The specific test perform clinical protocol develop collaboration extramural investigator select request proposal ( RFP ) . When develop , protocol portion study submit separately Institutional Review Board study amendment . Exposures estimate use detailed job-exposure matrix develop data monitoring perform different agency organization crisis , well information recommend actual use personal protection , information obtain interview , available scientific literature . It note , absence individual group monitor data worker , estimate exposure , whether base job activity refine job-exposure matrix , indicate degree potential exposure ( i.e. , exposure opportunity ) rather know exposure . We investigate acute health effect via self-report enrollment interview among cohort member also via clinical measure biological sample Active Follow-up Sub-cohort member . All cohort member follow development range health outcome record linkage ( cancer , mortality ) feasible , linkage electronic medical record may become available course follow-up . Health outcome among Active Follow-up Sub-cohort also identify self-report via periodic follow-up interview . Additional outcome information obtain Biomedical Surveillance Sub-cohort periodic follow-up clinical evaluation ( e.g. , spirometry , neurological testing ) analysis follow-up biospecimens ( e.g. , immunologic parameter , liver function , renal function , DNA damage ) . Follow-up entire cohort initially plan 10 year , extend follow-up possible depend upon scientific public health need availability fund . Recruitment subject begin March 2011 , telephone interview expect complete within 12-24 month baseline home visit within 18-26 month . For home visit , initially target worker reside four affect Gulf States ( LA , MS , AL , FL ) , although may expand state information geographic distribution worker potential exposure warrant additional follow-up state . We work closely Community Advisory Board develop community support study appropriate communication study material .</detailed_description>
