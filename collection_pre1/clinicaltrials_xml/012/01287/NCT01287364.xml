	<detailed_description>This open-label , randomize , multicenter , 2-way crossover study subject 12 year old perennial allergic rhinitis ( PAR ) evaluate psychometric property novel-patient administered assessment treatment satisfaction preference INCS . Subjects randomize 1 2 treatment sequence : Sequence 1 : Treatment Period 1 = ciclesonide hydrofluoroalkane ( HFA ) nasal aerosol 80 μg daily ; Treatment Period 2 = mometasone nasal inhalation 200 μg daily Sequence 2 : Treatment Period 1 = mometasone nasal inhalation 200 μg daily ; Treatment Period 2 = ciclesonide HFA nasal aerosol 80 μg daily Total study participation approximately 8 week include 3-week screening/baseline phase , 1-week treatment period , 1- 2- week washout phase treatment , second 1-week treatment period consist alternate treatment , additional 1-week follow period last dose study drug ass safety . Subjects require continue meet eligibility criterion second treatment period . Nasal symptom evaluate daily 7 day prior first dose study drug Treatment Period 1 last dose study drug Treatment Period 2 . The Allergic Rhinitis Satisfaction Preference ( ARTSP ) Modules Phase V® e-Health Outcomes Information System ( Phase V Technologies , Wellesley MA ) complete two time treatment period ( first dose day last dose ) via internet clinical site .

Male female 12 year old screen Subject must general good health ( define absence clinically relevant abnormality determine investigator ) base screen physical examination , clinical laboratory result , medical history . A history PAR relevant perennial allergen ( house dust mite , cockroach , mold , animal dander ) minimum two year immediately precede screen . The PAR must sufficient severity require treatment ( either continuous intermittent ) past , require treatment INCS throughout entire study period . At least one treatment PAR 6 month prior expect randomization nasal spray . A demonstrated sensitivity least one allergen know induce PAR ( house dust mite , animal dander , cockroach , mold ) base document result standard skinprick test either within 90 day prior screen . A positive test define wheal diameter least 3 mm large negative control wheal skinprick test . The subject 's positive test allergen must consistent medical history PAR allergen must present subject 's environment throughout study . Based upon subject 's medical history , investigator 's judgment , subject unlikely seasonal allergy exacerbation study .

Use shortacting betaagonists exerciseinduced bronchospasm allow . Expected use disallow medication study period . Expected initiation immunotherapy study period plan dose escalation study period . However , initiation immunotherapy 90 day prior screen use stable ( maintenance ) dose ( 30 day ) may consider inclusion . Nonvaccinated exposure active infection chickenpox measles within 21 day precede screening . Expected initiation pimecrolimus cream 1 % great tacrolimus ointment 0.03 % great study period plan dose escalation study period . However , initiation creams/ointments 30 day prior screen use stable ( maintenance ) dose study period may consider inclusion .
