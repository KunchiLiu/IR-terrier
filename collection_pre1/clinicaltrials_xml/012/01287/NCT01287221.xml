	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Rifampicin effective slow reverse progression multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) . Research study indicate abnormality protein synthesis structure part brain responsible MSA ( protein misfolding ) drug Rifampicin could potentially prevent reverse protein alteration . The study do participant early MSA . The study consist take drug 2 time day 12 month . Participants underwent evaluation symptom function underwent neurologic examination begin study , 6 month 12 month . They also contact 3 9 month telephone . Studies do 10 participate site .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MSA progressive , fatal disorder characterize autonomic failure parkinsonism and/or cerebellar involvement . Neuropathologically , MSA characterize glial cytoplasmic inclusion ( GCI ) abnormally aggregate α-synuclein ( α-syn ) . This study test hypothesis Rifampicin , ability inhibit formation α-synuclein fibril disaggregate fibril already form , delay progression reverse neurologic autonomic function symptom MSA . This approach propose potential approach treat parkinsonism specifically , MSA . In experimental model MSA , hypothesize Rifampicin would improve behavioral abnormality MSA halt reverse pathological change . The primary objective undertake double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial effect Rifampicin progression neurological autonomic failure MSA . The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) recommend stop study interim analysis primary endpoint reveal futility criterion meet .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants age 3080 year old diagnosis Possible Probable MSA parkinsonian subtype ( MSAP ) cerebellar subtype ( MSAC ) accord The Gilman Criteria ( 2008 ) . Participants le 4 year time document MSA diagnosis . Participants anticipated survival least 3 year opinion investigator . Participants willing able give inform consent . `` Normal '' cognition assess MiniMental State Examination ( MMSE ) . We require value &gt; 24 . Patients able swallow capsule whole . Pregnant lactating female . Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale ( UMSARS ) score &gt; 17 modified UMSARS I ( question 11 eliminate ) . Participants clinically significant unstable medical surgical condition , opinion investigator , might preclude safe completion study might affect result study . These include condition cause significant Central Nervous System ( CNS ) autonomic dysfunction , include congestive heart failure , recent ( &lt; 6 month ) myocardial infarct , thrombocytopenia ( &lt; 50 x10 ( 9 ) /L ) , immunosuppressed state , severe uncontrolled hypertension , severe cardiopulmonary disease , severe anemia ( &lt; 8g/dl ) , severe liver kidney disease ( creatinine &gt; 2.3 mg/dl ) uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ( HbA1c &gt; 10g % ) , alcoholism , malignant neoplasm , amyloidosis , uncontrolled hypothyroidism , unstable peripheral neuropathy , concurrent infection , orthopedic problem compromise mobility activity daily living , severe cerebrovascular accident ( hemiplegia , aphasia nondominant parietal lobe syndrome ) , neurotoxins neuroactive drug exposure , parkinsonism due drug ( include neuroleptic , amethyldopa , reserpine , metoclopramide ) . Participants take investigational product within 60 day prior baseline . Women childbearing potential practice acceptable method birth control . Acceptable method birth control study : surgical sterilization , intrauterine device , partner 's vasectomy , doubleprotection method ( condom diaphragm spermicide ) , hormonal contraceptive drug ( i.e. , oral contraceptive , contraceptive patch , longacting injectable contraceptive ) require second mode contraception . Participants take Tetrabenazine , Rasagiline Selegiline . The participant qualify Rifampicin study stop drug 3 month Participants know porphyria . Participants abnormal liver function test define 1.5 time upper limit normal . Concomitant therapy anticholinergic , alpha beta adrenergic antagonist , medication affect autonomic function stop prior autonomic evaluation . The regular use neuroleptic within six month prior initial evaluation . Occasional use neuroleptic antiemetic past allow , provide three dos take within previous 12 month . Since Rifampicin significant drugdrug interaction , particular attention devote use concomitant medication . Considering target population , exclude participant take antifungal medication ( itraconazole ) , antiarrhythmic like amiodarone , digitalis lorcainide , female hormone quetiapine ( Seroquel ) . Use methylphenidate , cinnarizine , reserpine , amphetamine , atypical antipsychotic risperidone , olanzapine , quetiapine Monoamine oxidase A ( MAOA ) inhibitor within one month prior baseline visit also exclusionary . Diseases feature Parkinson 's Disease ; e.g. , progressive supranuclear palsy , essential tremor , inherit cerebellar degeneration , postencephalitic parkinsonism . Dementia ( DSMIV criterion Amer . Psych . Association , 1994 ) . The score MMSE must &gt; 24 .</criteria>
