	<detailed_description>Physical therapy approach de facto rehabilitation stroke , involve human therapist assist stroke patient recover motor ability . Modern rehabilitation technology include robotics , functional electrical stimulation , transcranial magnetic stimulation virtual reality . Robotic rehabilitation alleviate labor-intensive aspect physical rehabilitation human therapist could potentially improve productivity stroke rehabilitation . However , fundamentally base movement repetition visual feedback help stroke patient improve motor ability weak stroke-affected arm leg . However , robot still able move weak part patient even patient attentive towards train thus robotic training becomes passive activity . In contrast , BCI-based robotic training work ensure active engagement hemiparetic patient make volitional movement . In addition , hemiplegic locked-in stroke patient motor power affect limbs able engage perform volitional movement affect limb . BCI-based robotic rehabilitation fill gap detect motor intent hemiplegic patient Electroencephalogram ( EEG ) signal drive robotic rehabilitation . This BCI-based robotic rehabilitation stroke research project jointly conduct Tan Tock Seng Hospital ( TTSH ) , National Neuroscience Institute ( NNI ) Institute Infocomm Research ( I2R ) . Preliminary clinical trial perform TTSH show stroke patient operate BCI effective healthy subject . Specifically , research project address follow gap area rehabilitation stroke : 1 . Single-modal BCI - The current system employ single modal non-invasive EEG-based BCI detects motor intent use least 2.5 second EEG data . Hence , research advance multi-modal BCI synergizing near-infrared spectroscopy EEG yield responsive effective BCI-based robotic rehabilitation system propose . 2 . Standard therapy - The current system employ standard therapy stroke patient . However , physiotherapists occupational therapist usually adopt individualized therapy stroke patient . Hence , research individualized therapy stroke patient accord learn rate neurological insult propose . 3 . Only physiological rehabilitation - The current system performs physiological rehabilitation motor function stroke patient . Currently validated scale post-stroke depression Beck depression inventory , CES-D , Zung scale , State trait , HADS etc difficult administer stroke patient participate assessment due impaired language cognitive ability . Hence advance BCI-based rehabilitation system also detect mental state stroke patient propose cover physiological psychological rehabilitation . 4 . Upper Limb rehabilitation - The current system use clinically-proven MIT Manus robotic rehabilitation system , perform upper limb rehabilitation stroke patient gross reach pattern . Human hand skill , contrast , consist complex manipulation movement pattern intervene BCI-based robotic rehabilitation . Hence , advance BCI-based rehabilitation system cover hand function propose cover rehabilitation entire upper extremity .</detailed_description>
