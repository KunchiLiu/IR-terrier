	<brief_summary>Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) frequent high grade lymphoma adult . Although immunotherapy improve prognosis , DLBCL heterogeneous disease patient exhibit wide range outcomes 5-year overall survival range 55 94 % depend International Prognostic Index factor . Diagnostic prognostic biomarkers mandatory optimize treatment . Transcriptomics use detect new biomarkers use microarrays analysis apply RNA collect total tumor tissue cell extract . Molecular prognostic factor thoroughly study DLBCL tumor tissue . However , big challenge obtain transcriptomic-qualified tumor sample multicentric prospective clinical trial . We hypothesize blood may deep source native secrete analytes therefore carry transcriptomic signature relate DLBCL prognosis . Our project organize extension GOELAMS-075 clinical trial concern aggressive DLBCL . Two complementary approach follow , one transcriptomic level confirmation diagnostic biomarkers assess predictive biomarkers . The one concern biologic study validate biomarkers tissue level . Our project organize around 4 workpackages ( WP ) , include task specific schedule &amp; predefined deliverable . The first one concern general management , data warehouse , collection different administrative preanalytic issue . The 3 WPs scientific . We first go validate 30-gene list , candidate diagnostic biomarkers , qRT-PCR : * ) independent set DLBCLs compare match healthy blood donor ( sensitivity assessment ) , ** ) series low tumor burden DLBCLs , mantle cell lymphomas non-malignant inflammatory disease constitute patient septic shock ( specificity assessment ) . All latter collection already available ready use . Secondly , complete series 89 hybridized patient AFFY WholeExon microarrays 60 supplementary available sample order ass molecular predictor patient outcome . This question address base 3-year 5-year well , EFS ( Event Free Survivor ) . All clinical data available GOELAMS eCRF . Since dispose 31 probesets , 30 single gene , signature DLBCL diagnosis involve 9 gene relate myeloid compartment include 6 gene involve directly Myeloid-Derived Cell Suppression ( MDSC ) process , 20 gene describe context cancer , 11 gene connect endothelial cell , decide explore flow cytometry blood circulate cell . We look myeloid population &amp; subpopulation , endothelial cell microparticles . The goal identification specific MDSC perturbation , angiogenic abnormality functional impact immune response context cancer . We expect work drive basic science clinical implication . On scientific level , blood carry molecular cellular component involve tumor-host interaction . Our project bring deep understand immunological response take place blood compartment . This immunological response characterize molecular , cellular functional level . On clinical point view , may bring new prognostic model DLBCL . As blood easily accessible , expect easily implement clinical practice allow design new clinical trial stratify tumor biology feature . It may also become new way monitor DLBCL 's response treatment . Furthermore , project provide large amount molecular data easily connect ongoing GOELAMS study . Valorisation finding also serious issue since project highly original valuable .</brief_summary>
