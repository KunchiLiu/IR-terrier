	<detailed_description>Background : - AZD6244 oral highly selective potent uncompetitive inhibitor mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 ( MEK1/2 ) . - The presence KRAS mutation predict resistance EGFR-directed antibody therapy metastatic colorectal cancer . This appear secondary KRAS activation signal cascade downstream EGFR receptor , include RAF/MEK/ERK pathway . - Our hypothesis EGFR inhibition cetuximab would augment patient KRAS mutation activation RAF/MEK/ERK cascade inhibit . Objectives : - To determine dose limit toxicity maximum tolerate dose AZD6244 combination cetuximab advance , refractory solid tumor . - To assess evidence anti-tumor activity combination , per tumor measurement use RECIST criterion . - To evaluate pharmacokinetics AZD6244 cetuximab administer concomitantly . - To evaluate safety tolerability combination AZD6244 cetuximab patient K-RAS mutate metastatic colorectal cancer . - To assess inhibition RAF/MEK/ERK pathway peripheral blood mononuclear cell secondary treatment AZD6244 . - To evaluate pharmacokinetics AZD6244 combination cetuximab relation treatment side effect . Eligibility : - Patients must histologically confirm malignancy metastatic unresectable standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . In MTD expansion cohort : Patients must biopsy proven K-RAS mutant , metastatic colorectal cancer . - Age great equal 18 - ECOG performance status less equal 2 Study Design : - This phase 1 dose escalation study AZD6244 combination fixed-dose cetuximab expand cohort K-RAS mutate metastatic colorectal cancer . - Patients treat AZD6244 orally twice daily continuously , cetuximab administer standard dos day 1 , 8 , 15 22 . Dose escalation outline per schema parent protocol . - The dose AZD6244 escalate use 3-patient cohort design base first cycle toxicity dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) define . Once MTD/RP2D identify , additional 12 patient K-RAS mutant colorectal cancer enrol dose level , effort fully characterize pharmacokinetic characteristic combination . If least 8 % response rate observe expand cohort , combination recommend future analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : In dose escalation cohort : Patients must histologically confirm malignancy metastatic unresectable standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . Histology base either primary tumor metastasis . In MTD expansion cohort : Patients must biopsy proven KRAS mutant , metastatic colorectal cancer progress least 2 prior standard therapy . KRAS mutation status must verify CLIAcertified laboratory . ( NOTE : colorectal patient enrol dose escalation portion need KRAS mutant order eligible ) . Patients must least 4 week since prior chemotherapy , 6 week last regimen include nitrosureas mitomycin C. Prior radiation allow long radiation complete 4 week prior study treatment 35 % marrow irradiate . Age great equal to18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use AZD6244 combination cetuximab patient less 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric phase 1 combination trial . ECOG performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ) . Life expectancy great 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes great equal 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL platelet great equal 100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( AST ALT less equal 5.0 X institutional upper limit normal permit liver metastasis present ) creatinine less equal to1.5X institution upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance great equal 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 , calculate CockroftGault formula , patient creatinine level institutional normal . May use 24 hr . urine collection determine creatinine clearance . Patients may receive prior cetuximab . Patients brain metastasis treat stable 2 month eligible study . Subjects undergoing anticoagulation therapy LMWH warfarin eligible . Subjects receive warfarin AZD6244 frequent PT/INR monitoring ( see section 10.0 ) EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients chemotherapy , radiotherapy hormonal therapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover ( less equal grade 1 ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Concurrent treatment investigational agent investigational agent ( ) use study OR treatment within 4 week study entry investigational agent ( ) device ( ) . Failure recover fully ( judged investigator ) prior surgical procedure . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition AZD6244 agent use study . Patients take high dos ( recommend daily dose ) vitamin E exclude . Patients discontinue use high dose vitamin E prior study entry consider eligible . Any condition ( e.g. , gastrointestinal tract disease result inability take oral medication requirement IV alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption , active peptic ulcer disease ) impair ability swallow retain AZD6244 capsule .
