	<detailed_description>This repeat-dose , double-blind , randomize , placebo control , three-way crossover study patient persistent bronchial asthma compare effect AM PM dose fluticasone furoate ( FF ) /Vilanterol ( VI ) inhalation powder ( 100/25mcg ) lung function . Twenty-four male female patient enrol study ensure twenty evaluable subject . After screen run-in period 14 day prior first dose . Subjects dose 14 day ( ± 2 day ) 3 treatment period , serial force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) measurements take 24 hour period follow Day 14 PM dose order determine FEV1 weight mean ( 0-24 hour ) . Peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) also monitor throughout study , start run-in period end third treatment period . Between treatment period washout period 14-21 day . Safety assessment include vital sign , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , adverse event ( AE ) monitor laboratory safety test , however , exception AEs constitute study endpoint . The result study provide support information understand implication time day dose therapeutic response FF/VI Inhalation Powder .</detailed_description>
