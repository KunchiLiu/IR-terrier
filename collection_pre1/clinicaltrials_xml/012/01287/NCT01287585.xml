	<brief_summary>This study ADI-PEG 20 ( pegylated arginine deiminase ) , arginine degrade enzyme versus placebo patient hepatocellular carcinoma fail prior systemic treatment ( chemotherapy ) . Hepatocellular carcinoma find require arginine , amino acid . Thus hypothesis restrict arginine ADI-PEG 20 , hepatocellular carcinoma cell starve die .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph 3 ADI-PEG 20 Versus Placebo Subjects With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Who Have Failed Prior Systemic Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomize 2:1 study drug versus placebo . Patients recruit North American , Europe Asia . In addition overall survival , progression free survival , response RECIST 1.1 criterion time tumor progression calculate . Safety tolerability assess , pharmacodynamics ( peripheral blood level arginine citrulline ) , pharmacokinetics ( peripheral blood level ADI-PEG 20 ) immunogenicity ( antibodies ADI-PEG 20 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Prior diagnosis HCC confirm histologically . Prior treatment least 1 systemic agent , document progressive disease systemic agent ( ) , adverse event ( ) associate prior systemic agent ( ) result discontinuance agent ( ) . Cirrhotic status ChildPugh grade B7 . Expected survival least 3 month . Adequate hematologic , hepatic , renal function . Candidate potential curative therapy ( i.e. , resection transplantation ) locoregional approach ( i.e. , ablation , embolization ) . Significant cardiac disease . Serious infection require treatment systemically administer antibiotic . Pregnancy lactation . Expected noncompliance . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness , psychiatric illness social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Subjects anticancer treatment within 2 week prior enter study . Subjects fully recover toxicity associate previous HCC locoregional systemic therapy . Subjects history another primary cancer , exception : ) curatively resect nonmelanoma skin cancer ; b ) curatively treated cervical carcinoma situ ; c ) primary solid tumor know active disease present opinion investigator affect patient outcome set current HCC diagnosis . Allergy pegylated product . Bleeding esophageal gastric varix within prior three month , except band treat . Subjects know HIV positive . Uncontrolled ascites ( define easily control diuretic treatment ) . Having receive blood transfusion , blood component preparation , erythropoietin , albumin preparation , granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( GCSF ) within 7 day prior screen laboratory screen laboratory obtain first dose study drug placebo . Use traditional medicine approve local authority , include limited Chinese herb within 14 day first dose study drug placebo . ECOG performance status &gt; 2 . Prior allograft , include liver transplant .</criteria>
