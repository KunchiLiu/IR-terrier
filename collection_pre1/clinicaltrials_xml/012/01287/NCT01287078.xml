	<brief_summary>Background : - Bronchiolitis obliterans bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome lung disorder occur complication either lung transplantation bone marrow/blood stem cell transplantation . In bronchiolitis obliterans , body white blood cell white blood cell transplant attack lung , lead destruction lung tissue , ultimately , scar fibrosis lung tissue . When patient develops fibrosis lung bronchiole , lung longer work properly , cause difficulty breathe lead diminish quality life increase risk death . Treatment typically involve immunosuppressive therapy oral cyclosporine steroid therapy , treatment marginally effective cause significant toxicity increase risk infection . Inhaled cyclosporine ( CIS ) achieve high concentration cyclosporine lung low concentration cyclosporine blood oral cyclosporine . Therefore , could advantage conventional oral immunosuppressive therapy use treat disorder . Researchers interested test whether inhaled cyclosporine therapy could use safe effective treatment bronchiolitis obliterans bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome occur bone marrow/blood stem cell lung transplant . Objectives : - To evaluate whether inhaled cyclosporine ( CIS ) improve stabilize lung function quality life individual bronchiolitis obliterans . Eligibility : - Individuals 10 80 year age diagnose bronchiolitis obliterans bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome blood lung transplant . Design : - Participants screen full medical history physical examination , well blood urine test , lung function test , image study , quality life questionnaire . - Participants take cyclosporine inhalation solution nebulizer . The nebulizer generate mist cyclosporine inhalation solution ( CIS ) , breathe mouthpiece . The process take approximately 20 minute . The solution provide single-use vial . - Participants continue take medication post-transplant care require doctor study researcher . Attempts make reduce dos type immunosuppressant give participant study , long treatment continue produce improve stable lung function . - Participants study visit every 3 week blood urine test , lung function test , image study . Participants also complete quality life questionnaire direct . Treatment continue minimum 18 week , follow final follow-up visit 2 week end study . - Participants benefit inhaled cyclosporine ( CIS ) may continue receive therapy inhale cyclosporine end study participation separate study extension .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclosporine Inhalation Solution ( CIS ) Lung Transplant Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients Treatment Bronchiolitis Obliterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchiolitis Obliterans ( BO ) obstructive lung disease affect individual undergone lung hematopoietic stem cell transplant . BO study extensively lung transplant recipient , consider represent chronic lung rejection . It lead cause death lung transplant , mortality rate 55 % . In hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , BO think manifestation chronic graft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) . Up 45 % patient undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation NHLBI develop decline pulmonary function . Conventional therapy patient develop BO consist augmentation systemic immunosuppressant . Systemic immunosuppression limit efficacy BO associate deleterious consequence include increase risk infection decrease graft-versus tumor/leukemia effect . Recently , cyclosporine inhalation solution ( CIS ) solution propylene glycol show improve overall survival chronic rejection-free survival lung transplant patient . These finding suggest target delivery immunosuppressive therapy diseased organ warrant investigation may minimize morbidity associate systemic immunosuppression . However , currently exist limited data regard overall efficacy inhale cyclosporine treat establish BO follow lung transplantation . Furthermore , inhale cyclosporine study treatment BO follow hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Here , propose evaluate safety , efficacy , pharmacodynamics inhale cyclosporine treatment BO . Two distinct patient population offer enrollment protocol : hematopoietic transplant recipient BO ( group A ) lung transplant recipient BO ( group B ) . Study participant receive CIS initial dose 150mg , three time weekly . Patients undergo dose titration maximum dose 300mg , three time weekly . Drug deposition pharmacokinetic analysis perform initiation treatment . Clinical parameter , include pulmonary function test , measure addition laboratory marker anti-inflammatory response CIS . Adverse event associate treatment record . The primary objective 1 ) ass safety efficacy inhale cyclosporine new therapy hematopoietic transplant patient lung transplant patient establish BO . Additionally , seek promote well understanding pathogenesis BO two transplant group assess anti-inflammatory effect inhale cyclosporine patient develop complication . The primary endpoint study group best response , FEV1 improvement stabilization study baseline week 18 two successive measure , least 1 week apart , 2 week apart . Secondary endpoint include toxicity profile measure CTCAE criterion ( safety ) , study pharmacokinetics lung deposition characteristic inhale cyclosporine , improvement high resolution chest CT image , result peripheral blood bronchoalveolar cytokine array assess secondary marker inflammation , functional capacity measurement use six-minute walk test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : History : &lt; TAB &gt; Hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient least 99 day post transplant ( group A ) Or Lung transplant recipient least 6 month post transplant ( Group B ) Biopsy proven bronchiolitis obliterans ( confirm NIH pathology department ) Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome ( BOS ) define : FEV1 le 75 percent predict No evidence pulmonary infection causative etiology lung dysfunction causative etiology Decline FEV1 ( The FEV1 value use determine BOS average 2 measurement FEV1 take sequentially least 3 week apart 6 month apart ) compare pretransplant baseline group A compare best posttransplant measurement group B . For hematopoietic transplant patient , FEV1 must decline less 10 percent pretransplant baseline ( group A ) For lung transplant patient , FEV1 must decline great 20 percent best posttransplant measurement ( group B ) And one following : FEV1/FVC le 0.7 Air trap see CT scan RV great 20 percent predict Evidence cGVHD affect least one organ system ( group A ) Age 1080 year Progressive disease stable disease ( active BOS , stable FEV1 criterion ) immunosuppressant study entry Progressive disease study entry : Diagnosis BO BOS evidence progressive decline FEV1 . A documented decline ( great equal 10 percent ) FEV1 occur within 18 week ( minimum documentation 3 week ) precede study enrollment Stable disease study entry : Diagnosis BO BOS immunosuppressive therapy evidence stable disease ( active BOS , stable FEV1 criterion ) , document stable FEV1 ( increase &lt; 5 % decrease &lt; 10 % ) within 18 week ( minimum documentation 3 week ) precede study enrollment Patients calcineurin inhibitor study entry require stable dose calcineurin inhibitor 4 week prior study enrollment EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Evidence uncontrolled , pulmonary infection Patients unstable coronary insufficiency , severe cardiac arrhythmia , and/or uncontrolled hypertension .
