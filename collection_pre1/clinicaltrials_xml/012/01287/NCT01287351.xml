	<brief_title>Real-world Effectiveness Cost-effectiveness Qvar Versus FP , US Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current asthma guideline underpin evidence derive randomise control trial ( RCTs ) . Although RCT data consider gold standard , patient recruit asthma RCTs estimate represent small percentage real-world asthma population . The poor representation asthma population due number factor , tightly-controlled inclusion criterion RCTs . There , therefore , need carry real-world observational study inform exist guideline effectiveness available treatment use every-day clinical practice heterogeneous asthma population . Asthma management guideline recommend long-term , daily anti-inflammatory controller therapy attenuate chronic airway inflammation persistent asthma . The choice inhale corticosteroid guide practical consideration ( e.g. , cost factor ) RCTs far fail identify consistent , significant difference outcomes among available inhaled corticosteroid , data observational study lack . FP HFA-BDP two main ICS therapy prescribe US management asthma . FP approximately twice potent efficacious , microgram basis , BDP . In clinical trial , however , extra-fine hydrofluoroalkane ( HFA ) formulation BDP demonstrate potency similar FP . This felt HFA-BDP show higher even lung deposition FP , HFA-BDP , unlike FP , distribution large small airway . Owing similarity effectiveness extra-fine HFA-BDP FP suggest clinical trial data , even lung distribution afford small HFA aerosol particle , hypothesise extra-fine HFA-BDP may least effective FP real-world clinical practice . This hypothesis support retrospective database study HFA-BDP versus FP use UK 's General Practice Research Database ( GPRD ) . The study find significantly low odds achieve composite proxy measure asthma control FP patient initiate ICS therapy ( 0.77 , 95 % CI 0.61-0.98 ) stepping-up ICS therapy ( 0.82 , 95 % CI 0.44-1.52 ) relative HFA-BDP . The analysis also reveal FP prescribe significantly high dose extra-fine HFA-BDP yet low associate odds achieve asthma control . In addition significant health benefit , deliver effective asthma control critical reduce substantial economic burden asthma , research indicate annual cost disproportionately attributable patient poorly control disease . Recent estimate place annual figure 56 billion dollar ( $ ) US alone , consist direct cost productivity losses.It therefore particular importance consider outcomes achieve relation cost incur assess overall benefit asthma therapy , cost-effectiveness analysis HFA BDP FP plan part current study . The aim study compare absolute relative effectiveness cost-effectiveness asthma management patient US inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) maintenance therapy extra-fine HFA-BDP ( Qvar® ) pressurise meter dose inhaler ( pMDI ) compare fluticasone propionate ( FP ) pMDI examine finding UK study , identify similarity difference effectiveness cost-effectiveness outcome prescribe practice two country .</detailed_description>
