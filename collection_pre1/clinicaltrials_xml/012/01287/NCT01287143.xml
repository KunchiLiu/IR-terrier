	<detailed_description>Background : Fever one prevalent sign hospitalize patient , signal activation immune system . There little empiric evidence relate symptom sign accompany change body temperature . Understanding nature , time relationship patient sign symptom fever provide insight febrile process guide inform treatment . Objectives : The protocol divide two phase : Phase I -To develop implement simple clinical tool assess document patient-reported sign symptom fever . Phase II -To describe prevalence relationship sign symptom accompanies febrile state relate pattern change time . Eligibility : Phase I - Adult pediatric medical-surgical patient hospitalized Clinical Center admit 3NE ( oncology/ transplant ) , 3NW ( surgical oncology ) 1NW ( pediatric ) . - Age great equal 8 year old - Understand speak English Phase II - Inpatients admit Clinical Research Center - Age great equal 8 year old . Design : Phase I -Descriptive study involve qualitative interview chart review medical surgical inpatient . Two type interview two different set patient conduct . The maximum number research participant phase 65 . The final sample size determine base point saturation , define four consecutive interview new sign symptom associate fever identify . The second set interview involve 20 30 new research participant , include least 5 patient less 18 year age review list sign symptom fever comprehension clarity inform final list determine terminology use FAST . Study Febrile Assessment Tool ( FAST ) -Test FAST 120 patient . Before place FAST electronic record ( Clinical Research Information System-CRIS ) new assessment tool use approximately 120 patient routine vital sign measurement . Patients admit surgical oncology unit ( 3NW ) consent follow collection FAST assessment Education Implementation - Inform nursing staff background , content procedure use Febrile Assessment Tool ( FAST ) - Educational interim last 4 week Phase II - Approximately 2 month discretion PI FAST education - Descriptive study involve chart review unidentified inpatient . The sample size maximum 500 .</detailed_description>
