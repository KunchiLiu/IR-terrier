	<brief_summary>The investigator study disease call `` necrotizing enterocolitis '' ( `` NEC '' short ) , affect premature infant . It common surgical emergency involve neonate admit Newborn Intensive Care Units . Currently , clinicians unable identify infant go develop NEC become ill. Clinical sign illness occur relatively late course condition , make NEC difficult treat . The investigator test new probe use safe level visible infrared light , without ultrasound imaging , see investigator identify infant get sick use simple , noninvasive test , This test repeat least one feeding ( stress gut ) day . If successful , health benefit large , estimate treat NEC alone ( include treat late complication ) add $ 650 million annual health bill .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In 5-year study , extend prior feasibility study test hypothesis very-low-birth-weight neonate ( VLBW ) develop necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) reliably detect early process use broadband optical spectroscopy sensitive change perfusion gut . Such perfusion change result regional tissue hypoxemia , demonstrate detectable combined broadband visible/near-infrared tissue oximetry , real-time method ass adequacy deep tissue oxygenation . Initially optical-only device ; combine ultrasound studied year 2-5 , first benchtop , intensive care unit . Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) common life-threatening surgical emergency encounter neonatal intensive care unit [ ] . NEC multi-factorial ( infectious , inflammatory , ischemic ) disease gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract newborns neonate . The end result mucosal injury and/or transmural necrosis intestine . Currently , test diagnose NEC early stage disease , later ominous clinical sign appear . The mortality NEC range 10 % 50 % , approach 100 % neonate severe form disease characterize full-thickness necrosis intestine , follow rupture sepsis . Ninety percent NEC case occur infant born 36 week ' gestational age , occur 10 % very-low-birth-weight ( VLBW , &lt; 1500g ) neonate [ ] . A diagnosis NEC increase NICU length stay 22−60 day , increase total hospital charge $ 76,000− $ 186,000 per case [ ] . Finally , Neonates recover NEC often incur additional serious complication ( malnutrition , liver dysfunction ) . NEC require surgery carry increase risk cerebral palsy , cognitive psychomotor impairment , . Repeated attempt use clinical sign reliably identify neonate likely progress severe NEC unsuccessful . Broadband oximetry appear offer solution . Developed PI others , broadband oximetry sensitive ischemia . It differ typical near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) method generally use 2-4 wavelength broadband oximetry measure hundred wavelength . Broadband approach , show significantly tight normal range , low noise , good reproducibility vivo . Further , typical NIRS fail account shifts water , fat , blood volume , stool , affect oxygenation measurement specifically account , make NIRS unreliable quantitative study gut . In contrast , just-completed 1-year feasibility R43 trial , demonstrate NEC detect use broadband method . The question remain : new device perform clinically multicenter study ? By incorporate broadband oximetry monitor management VLBW neonate , may detect NEC early stage prevent cascade lead bowel necrosis . Success lead quickly clinical use , team previously develop , receive FDA approval , commercialize two biomedical device .</detailed_description>
