	<brief_summary>Over past five year , spectrum study show stromal cell population surround embed cancer cell variety different tumor type intrinsically involved mechanism affect tumor growth metastasis . Among cell , fibroblast myeloid derive suppressor cell ( MDSCs ) show play key role regulation tumor cell behavior , via differential gene expression , regulation secretion specific chemokines ( e.g. , RANTES , CXCL12 CXCL14 ) , cytokine ( e.g. , TNF-α , IL-1β , NF-κB ) control inflammatory immunomodulatory cell , molecule potent growth factor . Of particular interest various stromal immune cell ( dendritic cell T cell ) inflammatory MDSCs find primary metastatic tumor behave differently present normal non-cancerous counterpart tissue . In light `` new understanding '' cancer biology , investigator believe systematic innovative approach research much need Taiwan Academy . Here investigator propose investigate tumor suppressive effect anti-inflammatory phytomedicines regulation stromal immune cell fibroblast breast cancer . The investigator employ TS/A 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma system conduct vivo study several specific candidate phytomedicines ( cytopiloyne , Wedelia chinensis , shikonin , emodin others investigator already identify confer anti-inflammation related activity ) inhibition TS/A 4T1 tumor growth specific effect inflammation-associated , cellular molecular function stromal immune cell , fibroblast MDSCs . When potent specific anti-tumor effect detect , investigator extend study three-dimensional collagen/Matrigel culture system ex-vivo study focus stromal cell-mediated -associated anti-tumor effect TS/A 4T1 cell , use `` organoid '' tissue culture system investigator previously develop laboratory ( JNCI , 1979 ; Cancer Res. , 1981 ) . The investigator establish reconstitute TS/A 4T1 tumor cell stromal immune cell co-cultivation system . When investigator achieve demonstrable success , investigator extend mouse system human breast cancer ( include primary metastatic tumor ) close collaboration ( investigator already establish ) Drs .</brief_summary>

The investigator study molecular signal effect specific phytocompounds already identify confer vivo ( mouse ) , anti-tumor anti-inflammatory activity , primary/organoid culture human breast tumor cell ex vivo condition . Finally , investigator intend identify key molecular regulator , immune-modulatory effector test stromal immune cell affected candidate phytomedicines , use molecular cell biology assay investigate interplay immune cell tumor cell stromal tissue . Our study expect reveal one highly specific , anti-inflammatory phytocompounds mechanistically confer specific effect stromal fibroblast immune cell type , result potent anti-tumor effect test mammary carcinoma system . Five Specific Aims thus design investigate immuno-modulating effect specific medicinal constituent TCM material . The experimental finding obtain study would provide insight molecular , cellular signal mechanisms/effects several medicinal phytocompounds may potential application chemoprevention herbal medicine adjuvant treatment human breast cancer .</detailed_description>
