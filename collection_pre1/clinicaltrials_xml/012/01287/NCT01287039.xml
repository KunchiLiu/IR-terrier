	<brief_summary>This Phase 3 , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study evaluate efficacy , safety , immunogenicity treatment reslizumab patient eosinophilic asthma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Reslizumab ( 3.0 mg/kg ) Reduction Clinical Asthma Exacerbations Patients ( 12-75 Years Age ) With Eosinophilic Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Demonstrate efficacy reslizumab , dose 3 mg/kg administer iv every 4 week 12 month , assess reduction frequency clinical asthma exacerbation ( CAEs ) 12 month . An exacerbation event consider CAE patient meet either criterion list corroborate least 1 measurement indicate worsen clinical sign symptom asthma : - use systemic , increase use inhale , corticosteroid treatment 3 day - asthma-related emergency treatment The criterion must corroborate least 1 measurement indicate worsen clinical sign symptom asthma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient male female , 12 75 year age , previous diagnosis asthma . The patient least 1 asthma exacerbation require oral , intramuscular ( im ) , intravenous ( iv ) corticosteroid use least 3 day past 12 month screen . The patient current blood eosinophil level least 400/μl . The patient airway reversibility least 12 % betaagonist administration . The patient ACQ score least 1.5 screen baseline ( 1st dose study drug ) visit . The patient take inhaled fluticasone dosage least 440 μg , equivalent , daily . Chronic oral corticosteroid use ( 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) allow . If patient stable dose , eg , 2 week oral corticosteroid treatment time study enrollment , patient must remain dose throughout study . The patient 's baseline asthma therapy regimen ( include limit inhaled corticosteroid , oral corticosteroid maximum 10 mg prednisone daily equivalent , leukotriene antagonist , 5lipooxygenase inhibitor , cromolyn ) must stable 30 day prior screen baseline , must continue without dosage change throughout study . All female patient must surgically sterile , 2 year postmenopausal , must negative pregnancy test ßhuman chorionic gonadotropin [ ßHCG ] ) screening ( serum ) baseline ( urine ) . Female patient childbearing potential ( surgically sterile 2 year postmenopausal ) , must use medically accept method contraception must agree continue use method duration study 30 day participation study . Written inform consent obtain . Patients 12 17 year old must provide assent . The patient reasonable health ( except diagnosis asthma ) judge investigator , determine medical history , medical examination , ECG evaluation ( screen ) , serum chemistry , hematology , urinalysis . Other criterion apply ; please contact investigator information . The patient clinically meaningful comorbidity would interfere study schedule procedure , compromise patient 's safety . The patient know hypereosinophilic syndrome . The patient another confound underlying lung disorder ( eg , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pulmonary fibrosis , lung cancer ) . Patients pulmonary condition symptoms asthma blood eosinophilia ( eg , ChurgStrauss syndrome , allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis ) also exclude . The patient current smoker ( ie , smoke within last 6 month prior screen ) . The patient use systemic immunosuppressive immunomodulating biologic agent ( include , limited , antiIgE mAb , methotrexate , cyclosporin , interferonα , antitumor necrosis factor [ anti TNF ] mAb ) within 6 month prior screen . The patient previously receive antihIL5 monoclonal antibody ( eg , reslizumab , mepolizumab , benralizumab ) . The patient aggravate medical factor inadequately control ( eg , rhinitis , gastroesophageal reflux disease , uncontrolled diabetes ) . The patient participate investigative drug device study within 30 day prior screen . The patient participate investigative biologics study within 6 month prior screen . Female patient pregnant , nursing , , childbearing potential , use medically accept , effective method birth control ( eg , barrier method spermicide , abstinence , IUD , steroidal contraceptive [ oral , transdermal , implanted , injected ] ) exclude study . NOTE : Partner sterility alone consider acceptable form birth control . Other criterion apply ; please contact investigator information .</criteria>
