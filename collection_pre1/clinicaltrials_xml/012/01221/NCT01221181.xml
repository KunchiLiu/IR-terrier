	<brief_summary>This open label , non-blinded , proof concept efficacy safety study eculizumab patient biopsy proven DDD C3 nephropathy . The trial consist adult patient diseases &gt; 1 gram proteinuria decrease glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , predictor poor long-term outcome many glomerular disease . They treat eculizumab one year . The goal determine whether treatment lead improvement kidney function , define remission proteinuria improvement estimate GFR ( measure serum creatinine ) , improvement histologic parameter , include percentage non-affected glomerulus , interstitial fibrosis , intensity C3 stain immunofluorescence , amount electron dense deposit electron microscopy . All enrolled subject receive eculizumab treatment one year . There 29 study visit 53 week . The goal determine whether treatment improve kidney function , evidence less protein urine improve lab result . An EXTENSION TREATMENT PHASE add . After complete study , patient follow labs every four week per standard care . If labs suggest relapse , allow continue therapy previous dosage drug receive FDA approval indication . Treatment interval dosage identical original study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eculizumab Therapy Dense Deposit Disease C3 Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety eculizumab adult patient dense deposit disease C3 nephropathy . Dense deposit disease ( DDD ) , also call membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis ( MPGN ) type II , rare form glomerulonephritis name characteristic appearance electron-dense material glomerular basement membrane observe kidney biopsy . The principle immune defect DDD excessive activation alternative complement pathway , deposition complement component glomerular basement membrane . Hence , immunofluorescence microscopy , heavy C3 deposit along basement membrane . Some patient find deficiency Factor H Factor I , inhibitor C3 activation . Others C3 nephritic factor , antibody activates alternative complement cascade . It recently recognize C3 nephropathy , rare glomerular disease mesangial cell proliferation C3 deposition immunofluorescence microscopy , associate similar over-activation alternative complete cascade . While DDD affect mostly child young adult , series 32 patient Columbia DDD whose biopsy read 1977-2007 , 18 patient ( 56 % ) old 16 year age time diagnosis , 40 % patient 30 year old . The age division important two reason . First , Columbia series , child appear well clinical outcome adult . While 25.9 % patient complete remission , significant distinction adult , 7.1 % achieve complete remission , child , 46.1 % achieve complete remission . Of remain patient achieve remission , 42.9 % adult , compare 7.7 % child , progressed end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) mean follow-up 5 year . Second , large clinical trial guide specific intervention DDD role immunomodulatory therapy still remain controversial , many nephrologists ( include center ) advocate use immunomodulatory therapy select adult patient . Immunomodulatory therapy specifically target DDD , corticosteroid , cyclophosphamide , calcineurin inhibitor , either unsuccessful study meaningful number patient warrant routine use . However , principal defect underlie DDD excessive activation alternative complement pathway , deposition complement component glomerular basement membrane , therapy directly target alternative complement pathway may prove particularly beneficial disease . Eculizumab humanize monoclonal antibody bind high affinity C5 . The drug FDA-approved treatment paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( mutation complement regulatory protein hematopoietic cell lead alternative complement pathway-mediated hemolysis ) . It currently study use atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome , rare disease mark diffuse microthromboses related activation alternate complement system . Eculizumab prevent cleavage C5 , thereby preclude formation C5a , implicate glomerular inflammation animal model DDD . Moreover , inhibit activation C5 , prevent formation membrane attack complex C5-9 . Speculatively , drug could provide effective , targeted therapy patient DDD . Eculizumab study unsuccessfully past patient membranous nephropathy , disease alternate complement pathway over-activated . Despite negative finding study , experience medication gain Columbia University Medical Center ; fact , one large recruit site placebo control randomize blind trial . The primary end point complete remission , define remission proteinuria &lt; 500 mg/day normal renal function . Partial remission , secondary endpoint , define reduction proteinuria least 50 % &lt; 2 g/day stable renal function ( i.e . 20 % increase serum creatinine ) . Other secondary endpoint base histologic parameter renal biopsy perform 1 year therapy compare pre-treatment ( baseline ) biopsies ; include change intensity C3 stain immunofluorescence , change percentage non-affected glomerulus , change percentage interstitial fibrosis tubular atrophy , change electron dense deposit electron microscopy . No response define failure meet criterion either complete partial remission , include patient unremitting proteinuria , progressive chronic kidney disease , progression ESRD .</detailed_description>

Patients chronic steroid therapy unable taper &lt; 10 mg/day exclude . Patients childbearing age refuse use birth control Patients baseline estimate GFR le 30 ml/min/1.73m2 Patients renal disease ( e.g . diabetic nephropathy , renal vascular disease ) would interfere interpretation study . Patients comorbid condition would interfere completion trial ( malignancy , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , recent myocardial infarction ) .
