	<detailed_description>The Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center ( JSC ) National Aeronautics Space Administration ( NASA ) AmeriSciences enter Space Act Agreement ( 1 ) , primary objective development nutritional product form dietary supplement maintain homeostasis , countermeasures reduce biological effect damage long-duration spaceflight mediate oxidative stress low Earth Orbit planetary exploration solar system , well provide optimal nutritional supplementation aid pre-spaceflight conditioning . NASA determine pre- , in- , post-flight assessment cell , animal human spaceflight induces oxidative stress crewmembers . There multiple potential source oxidative injury include , limited space radiation , noise , fuel reaction product , planetary regolith , exercise . Furthermore , NASA also determine several foreseen unforeseen physiological event control , avoid , encourage mean dietary modification supplement . Due unforeseen limitation available fresh food supply envision exploratory mission , desirable NASA nutritional supplementation available provide crewmembers augmentation intrinsic defense system oxidative damage , well potential nutritional contingency food shortage optimization diet . NASA identify need specific micronutrient formulation complement natural food source , astronaut protection long-duration space flight . AmeriSciences nutritional company specialize science-based product formulation , manufacture Good Manufacturing Practices ( GMP ) use standard model used pharmaceutical industry . It charge co-development , aid , clinical evaluation , construction , production say micronutrient formulation , level specification require meet NASA 's expectation safety efficacy .</detailed_description>
