	<criteria>Historically confirm advanced NSCLC stage IIIB IV Exon 19 deletion exon 21 activate mutation EGFR EGFR mutation status must confirm participation study . EGFR perform either central local laboratory . If analysis do locally , verifiable documentation confirm EGFR mutation status must submit review approval sponsor prior randomization . If local result available , formalinfixed , paraffinembedded archival tissue representative tumor , absence archival tissue , fresh tumor tissue sample sufficient size perform EGFR mutation analysis must submit centrally . Results central analysis must available prior randomization . Additionally , subject provide tissue block biomarker central analysis whenever possible . Ideal tissue requirement : block ≥5 mm2 tumor area sufficient provide four 4micron , five 10micron section Measurable disease accord RECIST ( version 1.1 ) ECOG performance status 01 Must able take oral medication Fasting glucose &lt; = 150 mg/dL ( 8.3 mmol/L ) .

Or , childbearing potential : 1. must negative urine pregnancy test Screening , 2. must use two form birth control ( least one must barrier method ) start Screening throughout study period 30 day final study drug administration . Acceptable form include : 1 . Established use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception ; 2 . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) ; 3 . Barrier method contraception : Condom OR Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository . Female subject must breastfeed Screening study period 30 day final study drug administration . Female subject must donate ovum start Screening throughout study period 30 day final study drug administration . Male subject female spouse/partners childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception consist two form birth control ( one must barrier method ) start Screening continue throughout study period 30 day final study drug administration . Acceptable form include : 1 . Established use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception . 2 . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) . 3 . Barrier method contraception : Condom OR Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository . Male subject must donate sperm start Screening throughout study period least 30 day final study drug administration . Patients must provide write informed consent participate study Patients may receive chemotherapy advanced NSCLC . Previous adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant treatment NSCLC permit Prior radiation therapy permit provided patient recover acute , toxic effect radiotherapy prior randomization . A minimum 28 day must elapse end radiotherapy randomization Prior surgery permit provide surgery do &gt; = 28 day prior randomization adequate wound heal occur prior randomization Prior exposure agent direct Human Epidermal Receptor ( HER ) axis ( eg , erlotinib , gefitinib , cetuximab ) Prior insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor ( IGF1R ) inhibitor therapy Malignancies NSCLC within past 3 year ( exception curatively treat ; basal squamous cell carcinoma skin ; locally advanced prostate cancer ; ductal carcinoma situ breast ; situ cervical carcinoma ; superficial bladder cancer ) Diabetes mellitus currently require insulinotropic insulin therapy Use proton pump inhibitor omeprazole within 14 day prior randomization . H2receptor antagonists ranitidine exclude Symptomatic brain metastasis stable , require steroid , require radiation and/or relate treatment ( i.e. , antiepileptic medication ) within 21 day prior randomization Participated interventional clinical study treat investigational drug within 30 day 5 half life whichever longer , prior initiation Screening course study . History poorly control gastrointestinal disorder could affect absorption study drug ( eg , Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis ) History ( within last 6 month ) significant cardiovascular disease unless disease wellcontrolled . Significant cardiac disease include second/third degree heart block ; clinically significant ischemic heart disease ; superior vena cava ( SVC ) syndrome ; poorly control hypertension ; congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II worse ( slight limitation physical activity ; comfortable rest , ordinary physical activity result fatigue , palpitation , dyspnea ) History arrhythmia ( multifocal premature ventricular contraction [ PVCs ] , bigeminy , trigeminy , ventricular tachycardia , uncontrolled atrial fibrillation ) symptomatic require treatment ( &gt; = grade 3 ) , leave bundle branch block ( LBBB ) , asymptomatic sustain ventricular tachycardia allow . Patients atrial fibrillation control medication exclude Mean QTcF interval &gt; = 450 msec screening Use drug know risk cause Torsades de Pointes ( TdP ) ( 'Torsades List ' www.azcert.org/medicalpros/druglists/bycategory.cfm ) prohibit within 14 day prior randomization Use strong/moderate CYP1A2 inhibitor ciprofloxacin fluvoxamine .
