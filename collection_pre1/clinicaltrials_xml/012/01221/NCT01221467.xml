	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) one common chronic childhood disease require life-long insulin therapy . Children adolescents T1D need regular insulin injection continuous insulin delivery use insulin pump order keep blood glucose level normal . The investigator know keep blood sugar normal range help prevent long-term diabetes-related complication involve eye , kidney heart . However , achieve treatment goal difficult tighter investigator try control blood glucose level , great risk develop symptom sign low glucose level ( hypoglycaemia ) . This particular problem night one solution develop system whereby amount insulin inject control computer closely match blood sugar level continuous basis . This achieve know `` closed-loop system '' small glucose sensor place skin communicates computer contain algorithm drive insulin pump . The investigator test system Cambridge last three year child find system effective prevent nocturnal hypoglycaemia . The next stage research test system longer period time home . In present study investigator plan study 16 adolescent age 12-18 year insulin pump therapy . During 21 night glucose control computer 21 night subject make adjustment insulin therapy . The investigator analyze data determine effect computer algorithm keep glucose level 3.9 8 mmol/L ( normal level ) reduce time spend glucose 3.9 mmol/L ( hypoglycaemia ) . Subjects ' response use system term life-style change , daily diabetes management fear hypoglycaemia assess . The investigator also test long term glucose control measure glycated haemoglobin blood parameter .</brief_summary>
