	<brief_title>A Study Assess AFM13 Patients With Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives : The overall objective study determine safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics activity single cycle AFM13 patient CD30 positive refractory and/or relapse Hodgkin lymphoma . Objectives : 1 . To determine safety tolerability increase dos single cycle AFM13 monotherapy . 2 . To determine OBD ( Optimal Biological Dose ) MTD ( Maximum Tolerated Dose ) AFM13 ; whichever reach first . 3 . To define pharmacokinetic profile AFM13 . 4 . To analyse immunological marker e.g . ADCC ( Antibody dependent cell mediate cytotoxicity ) , NK ( Natural killer ) cell activity , complement activation depletion , cytokine release . 5 . To assess immunogenicity AFM13 . 6 . To assess activity AFM13 .</detailed_description>
