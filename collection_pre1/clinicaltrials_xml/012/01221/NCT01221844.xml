	<brief_title>Bovine Lactoferrin Prevent Cure Iron Deficiency Iron Deficiency Anemia Complicated Pregnancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In industrialized develop country , iron deficiency ( ID ) iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) highly prevalent pregnant woman . ID IDA , pregnant woman consequence increase iron requirement , due enhance blood volume development fetal-placenta unit , represent high risk maternal infant health : preterm delivery , fetal growth retardation , low birth weight , inferior neonatal health . However , degree fetal ID always severe mother , iron transfer mother fetus regulate placenta . In particular , placental syncytiotrophoblast acquires ferric iron bound maternal transferrin apical membrane transferrin receptor ( TfR-1 ) , noticeably increase pregnant woman suffer ID IDA . Recently , suggest iron transfer fetus , occur 30th week gestation , also involve placental expression hepcidin ferroportin , two protein know modulate systemic iron homeostasis adult . As matter fact , iron homeostasis tightly regulate iron absorption , storage transport . The absorption nearly dietary iron ( 1-2 mg daily ) , ensure iron supply bone marrow , second third trimester pregnancy increase 4 8 mg/day , respectively . The iron absorption take place proximal duodenum include follow step : ( ) reduction iron ferric state ( III ) ferrous state ( II ) ferrireductase ( duodenal cytochrome B ; ( ii ) apical uptake enterocytes follow trans-cellular trafficking via divalent metal transporter 1 ; ( iii ) storage ferritin ; ( iv ) basolateral efflux iron transporter ferroportin . Ferroportin , know cellular iron exporter tissue blood , find cell type involve iron export , include enterocytes , hepatocytes , placental cell macrophage require ferroportin daily recycle 20 mg iron lysed erythrocyte erythropoiesis . Another pivotal component systemic iron homeostasis hepcidin , circulate peptide hormone synthesize hepatocytes iron load condition secrete plasma urine . Hepcidin regulate entry iron plasma ferroportin . Hepcidin , bind ferroportin , cause ferroportin phosphorylation , internalization degradation lysosome , thus hinder iron export enhance cytosolic iron storage ferritin . Iron homeostasis disorder appear arise hepcidin and/or ferroportin dysregulation . Similarly regulation maternal systemic iron homeostasis , fetal hepcidin control transfer maternal iron across placenta fetus enhance placental-fetal iron transport relate increased expression ferroportin placental basal fetal-facing membrane , consistent unidirectional mother-fetus iron transport . Even interaction hepcidin ferroportin explain regulation iron homeostasis systemic level , influence iron metabolism critical stage fetal development , still unknown . Regulation hepcidin expression seem occur transcriptional level production increase iron load inflammation decrease anemia hypoxia . Even molecular mechanism hepcidin regulation iron , oxygen anemia still unclear , know Interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) induce transcription hepcidin gene hepatocytes . In inflammatory infection disorder , cytokine induce hepcidin excess , ferroportin binding , contribute development anemia inflammation , characterize ID IDA despite adequate iron store . When iron export hinder , iron store host cell . However , inflammation may contribute ID IDA hepcidin-independent mechanism ( ) down-regulation ferroportin . Independently hepcidin synthesis , high level serum IL-6 seem down-regulate ferroportin mRNA expression , thus sequester iron inside cell block iron flow plasma . The inability export iron lead hypoferremia , decrease pool serum transferrin-Fe ( III ) iron-limited erythropoiesis . The recent discovery hepcidin-ferroportin complex greatly contribute clarify enigmatic mechanism systemic iron homeostasis . Notwithstanding , iron homeostasis disorder , ID IDA , still treat oral administration large quantity iron fer¬rous sulfate due poor bio-availability . Ferrous sulfate oral administration often fail exert significant effect ID IDA , frequently cause many adverse effect , include gastrointestinal discomfort , nausea , vomit , diarrhea , constipation . Recently , significant decrease total serum iron serum ferritin concentration related increase serum IL-6 concentration observe pregnant woman hemodialysis patient , orally treat ferrous sulfate . Therefore , hypothesize supplement iron export cell circulation , accumulate inside cell , thereby increase inflammatory status , similarly report animal treat ferrous sulfate . The weight evidence , let doubt efficacy safety ferrous sulfate oral administration , stimulate research effective approach prevent ID toxicity associate iron overload . The treatment ID IDA pregnancy entirely reconsider take account enhance blood volume development fetal-placenta unit , also factor , IL-6 , , induce hepcidin up-regulation ferroportin down-regulation , play pivotal role iron homeostasis disorder . For purpose , lactoferrin ( Lf ) , cationic iron-binding glycoprotein , able chelate high affinity ( KD w10/20 M ) two ferric ion per molecule ( 30 ) , emerge important regulator systemic iron homeostasis , able cure ID IDA . Lf synthesize exocrine gland neutrophils infection inflammation site . In human , free iron exceed 10-18 M avoid precipitation , microbial growth formation reactive oxygen specie . Lf tissue secretion transferrin blood assure iron bound scarcely available free-ion . Even several function , dependent independent iron bind ability , attribute Lf , recent clinical trial demonstrate natural compound may represent interest approach therapy ID IDA pregnant woman . As matter fact , milk derivative bovine lactoferrin ( bLf ) restore physiological transport iron tissue circulation , thus cure ID IDA . Moreover , differently ferrous sulfate , bLf oral administration exert anti-inflammatory effect decrease serum IL-6 concentration uncomplicated pregnancy . The hypercoagulable state represent one physiological change occur pregnancy . The hereditary thrombophilia ( HT ) , genetic predisposition inappropriately form clot , significantly increase adverse outcome include recurrent miscarriage , intrauterine fetal death growth retardation , preeclampsia placental abruption . It well know inflammation promote coagulation IL−6 high level plasma HT affect pregnant woman severe preeclampsia find . Moreover , elevate intra−amniotic IL−6 IL−8 level correlate preterm birth . Therefore , iron supplementation via oral administration ferrous sulfate increase serum IL-6 level uncomplicated pregnancy , could deleterious HT affect pregnant woman could contribute enhance iron overload tissue , inflammation cell damage . The bLf capability prevent cure ID IDA together ability decrease serum IL-6 concentration could effective even treatment ID IDA pregnant woman affect HT . In clinical trial , pregnant woman affect hereditary thrombophilia ( HT ) , suffer ID IDA , receive oral administration bovine Lf ( bLf ) 100 mg/twice day ferrous sulfate 520 mg/day . The number red blood cell , value hemoglobin , total serum iron , serum ferritin , haematocrit , serum Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) prohepcidin assay therapy , every 30 day delivery .</detailed_description>
