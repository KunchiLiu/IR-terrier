	<brief_summary>Recent study suggest prolonged daily sit time may negative effect health , even people engage daily physical activity . The aim present study explore whether individually tailor lifestyle counselling aim reduce TV-viewing sedentary activity leisure time work , reduce sit time waist circumference , weight blood pressure ; improve serum lipid level . From population-based health survey , 150 adult men woman 3.5 hour daily leisure time sit time recruit randomly assign 1 ) intervention group 2 ) control group . The intervention group participate 4 individually tailor lifestyle intervention session focus reduction daily sit time . The control group receive intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Evidence health benefit regular physical activity clear unanimous . Recently , observational study find prolonged bout sit time associate chronic disease mortality , even individual engage regular physical activity . These new finding indicate sedentary behaviour regard distinct class behaviour independent effect disease risk , separate behaviour leisure time physical activity . Prolonged daily sit time prevalent modern , western society , make exploration field research relevant public health issue . It remain test , whether possible reduce sedentary leisure time adult whether reduction sedentary leisure time lead decrease biological CVD risk factor . The investigator hypothesize sedentary behaviour leisure time work may reduce theory-based individually tailor lifestyle intervention . Aim : To examine whether individually tailor lifestyle intervention aim reduce TV-viewing sedentary activity leisure time work , reduce sit time , waist circumference , BMI blood pressure ; improve serum lipid level . Study population : From `` Health2010 '' study , initiate February 2010 RCPH , 150 sedentary participant consecutively invite randomised computer-generated random number A ) intervention group ( n=75 ) B ) control group ( n=75 ) , visit RCPH health examination . The entire Health2010 population comprise 4.000 men woman 19 69 year age . Control group : The control group instruct maintain usual lifestyle , include physical activity level sedentary behaviour . After intervention period terminate , participant control group give write material ( booklet etc. ) . Primary outcome measure : Time engage sedentary activity ( hour &amp; minute per day ) , measure ActivPAL . Secondary outcome measure : self-reported physical activity sit time , total cholesterol , HDL , triglyceride , LDL , weight , waist circumference , systolic diastolic blood pressure . Outcome measure obtain baseline ( inclusion ) 6 month . A possible effect intervention self-reported sedentary leisure time ( primary outcome ) biological CVD risk factor ( secondary outcome ) explore comparison intervention control group baseline follow-up . Regression analysis intention-to-treat analysis apply significance level 0.05 use .</detailed_description>
