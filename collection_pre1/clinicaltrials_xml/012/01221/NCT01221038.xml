	<brief_summary>Background : Heat stroke defined condition body temperature raise dangerous level may cause harm body tissue lead multi-system clinical pathological manifestation might lead death . Among heat stroke survivor defect thermoregulation develop consequence . In IDF , every soldier heat stroke , suspect heat stroke , must pass heat intolerance test Unit Military Physiology , rest period 4-6 incident , approximate period thermoregulation recuperate injury heat stroke . Until heat intolerance test , soldier must train avoid repeat incident heat stroke . The soldier ' ability return active duty base result exam . The heat tolerance test criterion develop Physiology Unit throughout year experience , prove adopted several lab Europe United States . The criterion generally include baseline temperature heart rate , base upon physiological response healthy men ( soldier ) physical effort involve test.In recent year grow trend IDF integrate female soldier combat division . As result , female expose physical effort various climate condition part training , part active duty mission division . Therefore , probability incidence heat injury increase among soldiers.Research result indicate difference efficiency thermoregulation mechanism men woman : It find woman threshold sweat vasodilatation high male . Additionally , although woman mechanism sweat slow , occur later period , find relative part sweat evaporate high , woman evaporate sweat efficiently ( make low sweat quantity compare men ) . Reduced efficiency thermoregulation mechanism woman also attribute difference mass , body composition ( fat muscle mass ) , physical fitness gender . In addition , physiological change occur different phase menstrual cycle affect core temperature rest thermoregulation . Different report literature indicate decrease thermoregulation capacity luteal phase menstrual cycle compare follicular phase . Apparently , thermoregulation capability exercise link progesterone blood level , influence contraceptive pill phase menstrual cycle . There two factor cause incorrect diagnosis level heat tolerance female specific test interpret base set criterion men . These criterion : 1 . The physiological difference men woman 2 . The difference woman base menstrual cycle use contraceptive pill . Thus , need characterize establish normal value heat tolerance test young female compare male , also correspond current menstrual cycle phase use contraceptive pill . Methods : first day research , participant undergo anthropometric examination ( measure height , weight , BMI , fat content , maximum oxygen consumption ) . In addition , participant undergo heat tolerance test protocol . The heat tolerance test conduct twice every participant - follicular phase menstrual cycle , second time luteal phase cycle . During protocol , follow information collect participant : heart rate , core temperature , skin temperature three location ( chest , arm , leg ) , oxygen consumption liquid balance . The result examination compare result male participant previously undergone heat tolerance test Unit Military Physiology . Contribution IDF : research allow administrate heat tolerance test accurately reliably female soldier affect heat injury suspect heat intolerant .</brief_summary>
