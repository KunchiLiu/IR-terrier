	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine whether investigational drug GM602 , effective safe treatment ischemic stroke ( stroke cause blood clot block flow blood one , blood vessel supply brain ) administer 18 hour symptoms begin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study GM602 Patients With Acute Middle Cerebral Artery Ischemic Stroke Within 18 Hours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke serious life threaten disease . About 85 % stroke ischemic , cause blood clot plaque block blood vessel brain . The thrombolytic drug tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) early treatment acute ischemic stroke approve FDA . Treatment tPA must administer within three hour stroke onset . Furthermore , tPA treatment carry recognize risk bleed brain . GM602 investigational drug may act neuroprotectant patient stroke . It think stop cell death reduce inflammation injured area brain . This study design evaluate safety efficacy GM602 administer intravenously patient three consecutive daily dose 320 mg/dose 480 mg/dose , initial dose administer within 18 hour onset acute ischemic stroke Middle Cerebral artery region .</detailed_description>
