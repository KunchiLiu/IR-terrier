	<brief_summary>Manual treatment offer benefit patient suffer back pain little know many tissue layer affect . This study help identify tissue may stimulate sufficiently source clinical effect treatment prioritize future work understand mechanism back pain improve care . Current soft-tissue ultrasound elastography technique , static condition , extend quantify relative displacement strain ( active passive ) across depth tissue strata arise small amplitude motion continuous passive motion clinical procedure weight bear posture . Relative movement stratify layer back , treatment task-generated perturbation , enable elastography interrogation tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Tissue displacement strain differs dependent comparable task , recumbent v upright posture muscular activation . - Refine motion track stabilization manual elastography , use preliminary study , evaluate layer tissue strain pattern clinical continuous passive motion ( flexion , extension lateral bending ) standardize weight bearing ( stance , flexion 15 degree arm-extended weight hold ) . 2 . Relative muscle activity significantly relate muscle strain ratio . - Evaluate biceps simple model , parallel , displacement elastography change . 3 . Displacement strain decrease monotonically depth paraspinal tissue surface increase . - Evaluate timing relationship total passive load , myoelectric paraspinal behavior displacement/strain characteristic l4/l5 level longissimus , intermuscular fascia multifidus baseline standardize weight bearing task well recumbent baseline , return neutral prone lateral recumbent continuous passive motion maneuver . 4 . Change tissue displacement strain differ healthy unhealthy individual change muscle activity tissue layer take account . - Assess difference displacement strain characteristic layer longissimus , intermuscular fascia multifidus healthy chronic low back patient time relationship movement , total passive load amplitude myoelectric activity .</detailed_description>
