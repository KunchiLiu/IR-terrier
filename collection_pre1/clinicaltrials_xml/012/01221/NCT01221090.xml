	<brief_summary>To evaluate effectiveness two different diabetes self-management approach ( Personal Digital Assistant-based intervention &amp; Chronic Disease Self-Management Program ) reduce health disparity minority , rural resident , underserved population type 2 diabetes Central Texas . We hypothesise : 1 ) Racial/ethnic minority patient T2DM find experience disparity diabetes self-management treatment protocol clinical outcome , persist even control age , gender , obesity , insurance status ; 2 ) Patients T2DM reside rural area find experience disparity diabetes self-management treatment protocol clinical outcome compare urban counterpart , control age , gender , race/ethnicity , obesity , insurance status ; 3 ) The introduction CSDMP HIT protocol improve diabetes-related self management behavior , reduce HBA1c value , increase quality life person T2DM compare control . A combined intervention approach result great reduction ; 4 ) Health improvement follow introduction CDSMP , HIT CDSMP/HIT protocol person T2DM compare control mark racial/ethnic minority patient patient reside rural area ; 5 ) The introduction self-management intervention cost-effective reduce HbA1c value time , associate health care utilization include overall reduction ER acute care hospital admission ; 6 ) Although little prior research area guide specific hypothesis , hypothesize , overall , significant cost-effective differential CDSMP compare HIT approach , although cost-effective ratio may stronger particular subpopulation . The combined approach high cost , also anticipate high cost-benefit ratio minority population ; 7 ) The majority clinicians willing let patient enroll study reinforce intervention protocol ; 8 ) These intervention embed exist health care structure . At end study , Scott White institutionalize cost-effective treatment protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diabetes Self-Management Models Reduce Health Disparities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite concert federal state attempt reduce health disparity past decade substantial disparity report rate chronic disease minority still exist . In particular , African Americans Hispanics experience high rate Type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) segment U.S. population . The objective propose research project test two different diabetes self-management ( DSM ) program large multi-site health care organization Central Texas serve large population minority rural resident , compare outcome order evaluate efficacy reduce health disparity . Our specific aim : 1 ) document nature magnitude extant health disparity diabetes treatment process outcomes ; 2 ) evaluate different DSM intervention approach behavioral clinical outcome , attention differential effect patient environmental characteristic ; 3 ) examine cost-effectiveness different approach DSM education minority rural population ; 4 ) explore reach intervention effort broader organizational impact DSM education , include feedback loop clinicians organizational receptivity self-management approach . Our study employ four different activity : 1 ) initial electronic chart review 1300 record adult ; 2 ) 2 2 open 24 month randomize clinical trial behaviorally technologically base DSM intervention 400 adult age 21 old type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) ; 3 ) cost-effectiveness analysis different treatment approach ; 4 ) survey primary care provider health care administrator . While primary outcome reduction hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , conceptual model include clinical , behavioral , economic organizational outcome . We also assess extent intervention reduce health disparity examine differential treatment success . This study innovative comparison behavioral technological intervention approach , attention public health impact cost-effectiveness different intervention approach , concern organizational response intervention sustainability . A noteworthy significance strengthen linkage clinical community treatment approach identification successful treatment strategy different setting population .</detailed_description>
