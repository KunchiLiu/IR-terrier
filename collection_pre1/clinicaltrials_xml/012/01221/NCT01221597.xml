	<brief_summary>This study Phase 3 , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study safety efficacy AA4500 0.58 mg subject Peyronie 's disease . Approximately 400 ( 267 AA4500 133 placebo ) men randomize . Subjects screen study eligibility within 21 day initial injection study drug first treatment cycle . Before dose , subject stratify degree penile curvature deformity ( ie , 30º 60º 61º 90º ) randomize two treatment group receive 2:1 ratio either AA4500 0.58 mg placebo . In study , qualified subject may receive four treatment cycle ; cycle separate period 42 day ( ± 5 day ) . During treatment cycle , subject receive two injection study drug least 24 hour 72 hour injection . After final injection treatment cycle , investigator qualify designee model penile plaque attempt stretch elongate plaque . If subject 's penile curvature reduce &lt; 15 degree first , second , third cycle injection treatment clinically indicate , subsequent treatment cycle administer . Following maximum four treatment cycle , subject follow additional safety efficacy assessment Days 169 ( ± 7 day ) , 232 ( ± 7 day ) , 295 ( ± 7 day ) , 365 ( ± 7 day ) ( nominal week 24 , 33 , 42 52 ) . Subjects randomize placebo may receive open-label AA4500 treatment complete study part another protocol .</brief_summary>
