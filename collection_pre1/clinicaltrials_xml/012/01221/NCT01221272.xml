	<brief_summary>This study enrol participant document exercise-induced myocardial ischemia order evaluate whether ranolazine , take prior exercise , improve blood flow heart ( myocardial perfusion ) , assess exercise-induced myocardial perfusion defect size ( PDS ) total perfusion deficit ( TPD ) , use gate single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) . This 2-period crossover study . The last dose period must take 3-4 hour prior conduct exercise SPECT MPI . After research exercise SPECT MPI perform end Period 1 , participant discontinue treatment randomized period begin treatment Period 2 .</brief_summary>
