These compound may increase likelihood develop PTSD administer day traumatic event - effect immediate intervention study - despite frequent uninformed use stage . This work evaluate effect diazepam - BZ compound - PTSD symptom trajectory follow traumatic event randomize controlled design . Following study opiates hop diazepam , administer within hour traumatic event , first night sleep ( memory consolidate condition ) reduce likelihood develop PTSD .
