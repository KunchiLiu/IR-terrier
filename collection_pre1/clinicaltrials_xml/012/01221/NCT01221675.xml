	<brief_summary>Lung cancer currently lead cause cancer death men woman Europe , estimate 250000 new case diagnosed 2005 . The continued poor outcome patient indicate current recommend regimen fall short . In addition , many commonly use chemotherapy agent associate severe nonhematologic toxicity often cumulative nonreversible impair quality life essentially palliative setting . Therefore , agent novel mechanisms action superior safety profile need investigate . More 50 % lung cancer show carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) expression anti-CEA radioimmunotherapy ( RAIT ) could use . The investigator group show pretargeted RAIT ( PRAIT ) use bispecific antibody ( bsMAb ) deliver high radiation dose tumor directly radiolabeled anti-CEA antibody , show improve anti-tumor efficacy . This clinical trial design assess PRAIT use entirely new recombinant anti-CEA bsMAb 177Lu-labeled peptide treatment CEA-expressing small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) CEA-expressing Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma ( NSCLC )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TF2- Small Cell Lung Cancer Radio Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose open-label prospective optimization phase I/II clinical trial examine safety , optimal dose , target , dosimetry efficacy PRAIT use humanize anti-CEA x anti-HSG bsMAb TF2 177Lu-IMP-288 peptide pretargeted patient CEA-positive SCLC CEA-expressing Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma ( NSCLC ) This study 2 part : Study plan I ( Optimization study ) Study plan II ( Escalating activity phase I/II study ) . The Study plan I design optimize pretargeting procedure use blood pharmacokinetics ( Pk ) dosimetry 9 patient receive escalate dos TF2 follow 2 4 day later 1.1 GBq/m2 177Lu-IMP-288 . The study plan II design determine MTD 177Lu-IMP-288 use dosimetry toxicity data phase I/II study perform patient receive optimal dose TF2 bsMAb ( determine study plan I ) follow 2 4 day escalate activity 177Lu-IMP-288 . A pre-therapy imaging study ( use TF2 follow 2 4 day later 185 MBq 111In-IMP-288 ) perform two study plan qualify patient treatment subsequent therapy dose .</detailed_description>
