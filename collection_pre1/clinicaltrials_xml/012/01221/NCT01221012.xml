	<brief_summary>Current protective clothing kind , especially nuclear-biological-chemical ( NBC ) protective garment , amplify thermal stress inherent property clothe material . High insulation coefficient low water vapor permeability protective cloth limit ability sweat readily evaporate , consequently result significant elevation body temperature excessive body fluid loss ( inefficient sweating ) might result significant dehydration . Combat soldier require perform intense physical activity hostile environmental condition , include contaminate area need use protective garment . The ability fulfill mission derive soldier 's professionalism physiological limit . It well establish wear protective garment affect tolerance time ( TT ) performance . To operate contaminate area suitable protective garment worn . The inherent characteristic current protective garment limit , however , effective work period ensemble , aggravate hot climate . Thus , attempt increase TT enhance work effectiveness , improve protective garment , result lessen heat-stress , different stage development . The relative influence air permeability property , garment weight garment construction heat stress physiological strain investigate . The result quantify term body temperature , heart rate , fluid balance , subjective sensation maximum wear time ( necessary extrapolate ) .</brief_summary>
