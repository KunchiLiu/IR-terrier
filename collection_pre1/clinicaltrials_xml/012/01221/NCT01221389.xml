	<brief_summary>Information management casualty ongoing conflict Afghanistan Iraq bring question traditional approach blood transfusion hemorrhage patient . Present recommendation transfuse plasma product coagulation test become abnormal . The propose trial investigate whether aggressive plasma transfusion strategy advocate researcher base Central Asian conflict valid . Since study determine full impact alter plasma transfusion practice would require thousand patient , feasibility trial appropriate propose . The hypothesis thus : Primary Hypothesis- A multicentre trial investigates earlier use plasma patient hemorrhagic shock go emergency surgery feasible . Secondary Hypotheses- The early use universal donor blood plasma ( AB+ plasma ) patient shock due blood loss ( i.e . hemorrhagic ) go emergency surgery reduce overall exposure total number blood donor product ( so-called allogeneic blood exposure ) . A reduction allogeneic blood exposure would reduce total number blood transfusion-related complication . The early use plasma product safe increase incidence blood clot transfusion-related complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigations arise review casualty management ongoing conflict Afghanistan Iraq challenge standard approach blood transfusion hemorrhage patient . Present recommendation ideally transfuse non-red blood cell blood product indicate coagulation blood test . In event test available feasible , clinical judgment advise two recommendation . The first platelet usually require red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusions one blood volume ( approximately 5 liter blood loss ) ; second plasma usually require RBC transfusion well one blood volume . Contrary recommendation evidence conflict indicate delay plasma transfusion reduce plasma dosing associate increased mortality . Although evidence primarily retrospective time circumstantial nature , relationship plasma administration mortality appear causation rather simple association . Matching injury severity important variable alter conclusion . If conclusion true , question become whether transfusion practice patient civilian set change . The present plasma transfusion recommendation largely base study plasma exchange patient use data 1970 's . In plasma exchange , patient control removal plasma ultimately replace donor plasma . Coagulopathy develop solely amount plasma removal since consumption factor exist . Hemorrhaging patient however lose coagulation factor shed blood due ongoing consumption site injury . Further , hemodynamic instability hypovolemia experience hemorrhage patient exacerbate reduction clot factor level . Prior late 1980 's , hemorrhage patient often receive whole blood transfusion . Whole blood , long used circumstance , contain approximately 1 unit plasma unit . Thus , patient receive whole blood develop coagulopathy quickly patient receive standard pack red blood cell unit . Despite lack prospective study significant limitation support evidence , practice wait administer plasma rapidly adopt . Reasons several include concern infectious transmission , shortage blood product financial cost blood product . Regardless reason development however , present transfusion recommendation include plasma may longer applicable circumstance . A strong argument wait coagulopathy develop treat consequence coagulopathy grave avoid . The coagulopathy hemorrhagic shock major component 'lethal triad ' see hemorrhage patient ( conjunction acidosis hypothermia ) . The lethal triad high mortality rate ( 70 % ) limit ability physician treat . Evidence support argument primarily come conflict Central Asia . Several retrospective study publish US Army Institute Surgical Research challenge practice result change US arm force manage trauma patient . The US military us plasma 1:1 ratio traumatize soldier ( i.e . 1 unit plasma give every unit pack RBC ) . Major hemorrhagic injury non-military situation consist primarily traumatic injury major blood vessel ( i.e . vascular ) injury . Although injury problem exactly military casualty , major commonality population group allow result military study applicable civilian population . Retrospective case-control trial non-military trauma rupture abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) offer indirect evidence support different plasma transfusion practice akin military recommendation . Computer simulation model massive blood transfusion scenario also give credence premise traditional transfusion practice incorrect actively hemorrhage patient advocate earlier use plasma . A retrospective chart review 5 year perioperative management Priority 1 AAA rupture The Ottawa Hospital conduct research ethic board approval . Of 145 reviewed case , 64 % survival rate . The use plasma occur 75 % patient 99 % patient expose allogeneic blood product . Plasma use associate poor outcome serve marker case higher blood loss blood product exposure . The use plasma however consistent present recommendation thus appear reactive nature , rather proactive use . A definitive trial ass role early plasma perform . Unfortunately , study determine full impact alter plasma transfusion practice would require thousand patient . The emergency nature surgical patient would also make ability randomize patient challenge . The goal present trial therefore ass feasibility trial . We need assess ability randomize patient , prepare plasma deliver timely fashion . Further , logistics physician administer study fluid ( i.e . plasma colloid control ) timely fashion determine . Finally , ability accurately measure outcome assess .</detailed_description>
