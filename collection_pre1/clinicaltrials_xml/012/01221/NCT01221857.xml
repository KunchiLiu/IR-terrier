	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) potentially curative procedure various hematological malignancy , bone marrow failure syndrome inherit metabolic disorder . The application allogeneic HSCT limit donor availability approximately one-third otherwise appropriate candidate suitably match family donor . Alternative donor include mismatch family member match unrelated donor , approach often complicate increase risk graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) prolong cumbersome search procurement process . In addition , far few subject racial minority find suitable human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -matched donor . Umbilical cord blood increasingly use alternative source stem cell extend availability allogeneic HSCT patient would otherwise eligible curative approach . In last decade number cord blood transplantation relate unrelated donor increase dramatically . It estimate 20,000 patient undergone cord blood transplantation unrelated donor date variety genetic , hematological , immunological , metabolic oncologic disorder . The major advantage cord blood transplantation include easy procurement , risk donor , reduce incidence transmitting infection , immediate availability , reduce risk acute GvHD set donor-recipient HLA mismatch . Nevertheless , low cell dose remain main limitation cell source lead delay hematopoietic reconstitution , high risk graft failure relatively high treatment related mortality rate compare hematopoeitic cell source . To improve outcome extend applicability cord blood transplantation , one potential solution ex vivo expansion cord blood-derived stem progenitor cell . The Sponsor undertaken develop NiCord® , base novel technology ex vivo cell expansion cord blood derive hematopoietic progenitor cell . By increase number short long-term reconstitution progenitor cell transplant , NiCord® potential enable broad application umbilical cord blood transplantation improve clinical outcome subject high-risk hematological malignancy . The main objective current study evaluate safety co-transplantation NiCord® unmanipulated cord blood unit patient hematological malignancy follow myeloablative therapy .</detailed_description>
