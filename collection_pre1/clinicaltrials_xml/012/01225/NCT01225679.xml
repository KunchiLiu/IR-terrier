	<brief_summary>Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome ( CCHS ) rare disorder respiratory control characterize ventilatory impairment result arterial hypoxemia . Although patient typically present disease newborn rarely later infancy , report patient present CCHS adulthood . The present study report unique familial case father ( proband ) present late-onset CCHS expansion mutation Phox2B gene confirm genetic analysis . Surprisingly , proband report manifestation disease childhood , disease progress follow insidious course adulthood . At time diagnosis , present sign pulmonary hypertension right-side heart failure . The patient respond well nocturnal invasive ventilation . In contrast , son present CCHS newborn full complement symptom daughter . The present report show CCHS case characterize mutate Phox2 gene progress without many symptom treatment approach use efficient control course disease . Furthermore , case indicate incomplete penetrance occur . Genetic screen family member mandatory evaluate reproductive risk disease , especially asymptomatic mutation carrier may high risk develop disease transmit next generation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome ( CCHS ) rare disorder respiratory control characterize ventilatory impairment result arterial hypoxemia . This condition bad sleep occurs patient normal mechanical property lung . It diagnose absence primary neuromuscular disease , identifiable brainstem lesion , sleep disturbance substance use . Amiel et al . ( 2003 ) identify mutation Phox2B gene associate CCHS , characterize 5 9 alanine expansion within 20-residue polyalanine region exon 3 Phox2B gene . Several report confirm finding Amiel et al. , support view gene master switch development autonomic nervous system network link respiratory control . Transgenic animal carry human Phox2B mutation develop similar phenotype lack glutamatergic neuron locate parafacial region brainstem , involved breathing control . Although patient typically present CCHS newborn rarely later infancy , report patient present CCHS adulthood . In case late-onset CCHS , patient report symptom since childhood , parent history CCHS . Symptoms right-side heart failure generally observe time diagnosis , nocturnal noninvasive ventilation frequently indicate . The present study report unique familial case CCHS father ( proband ) present late-onset CCHS link Phox2B gene expansion mutation . The presentation , course development treatment response patient unique His son present CCHS newborn , daughter .</detailed_description>
