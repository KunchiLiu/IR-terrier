	<brief_summary>Transient tachypnea newborn ( TTN ) diagnosis give infant bear 34 42 week gestation develop difficulty breathe first day life specific cause breathing difficulty identify . Little known baby develop TTN , many formal study best way take care baby disease . Babies TTN get well within three five day birth , may require extra oxygen breath well . Most physician believe symptom TTN relate poor clearance fluid newborn 's lung . Babies TTN extra fluid visible chest x-ray . Diuretics , medicine help clear extra lung fluid adult baby extra lung fluid reason , help baby TTN . Babies TTN need intravenous fluid healthy breathe fast able eat . Breastfed baby get small amount fluid first day life , normally take several day new mother begin produce breastmilk . No one yet examine whether give baby TTN amount fluid similar small amount would receive could breastfeed would help recover TTN faster . In study , investigator compare whether give newborn `` standard '' intravenous fluid amount intravenous fluid close breastfed baby would receive speed recovery newborns TTN .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Project Abstract Transient tachypnea newborn ( TTN ) self-limited respiratory distress syndrome term late pre-term neonates.1 Respiratory distress attribute TTN require management otherwise healthy infant intensive care set , thus increase cost , often length , hospitalization well decrease opportunity parent-child bonding first day life . Although hundred thousand child treat TTN every year ( 250 Mount Sinai NICU 2005 alone ) , little data underlie standard care medical management . We conduct prospective study neonate diagnose TTN determine change fluid management affect course disease . 2 . Specific Aims To determine whether fluid restriction first 72 hour life speed resolution respiratory distress neonate diagnose TTN . 3 . Concise statement Significance/Background Transient tachypnea newborn ( TTN ) self-limited respiratory distress syndrome term late pre-term neonates.1 Newborns TTN develop clinical sign respiratory distress within first hour birth , absence pathology surfactant deficiency , infection , meconium aspiration , anatomic cardiac pulmonary anomaly . Signs TTN include tachypnea ( respiratory rate consistently &gt; 60 ) , subcostal , intercostal , suprasternal retraction , nasal flaring , grunting , hypoxia correctable low FiO2 supplemental oxygen ( &lt; 0.40 ) via conventional nasal cannula continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . The condition usually resolve supportive care within 72 hour without significant long-term adverse sequela . Transient tachypnea newborn associate transient pulmonary edema diagnose typical chest x-ray finding . The traditional explanation postnatal pulmonary edema poor clearance fluid fetal lung perinatal period . Retained fluid lead bronchioalveolar collapse variable area hyperinflation air trap neonatal lung . The newborn compensates ventilation/perfusion mismatch tachypnea increase work breathing , often completely compensate , become hypoxic period fluid reabsorption . This pathophysiologic argument support finding brief absent labor short absent time birth canal associate TTN.2 , 3 It long hypothesize mechanical force labor delivery work `` squeeze '' edema away air-exchange surface lung lymphatics . More recently , study demonstrate immaturity sodium ion channel transporter lung epithelium may play significant role failure pulmonary fluid reabsorption mechanical forces.4 , 5 Data animal model show absent labor , find schedule Cesarean section , may lead delivery normal hormonally-mediated upregulation activation sodium transporter occur thus may explain increase likelihood develop TTN see patient cohort . Conditions increase central venous pressure decrease thoracic duct clearance also associate TTN.6 Additionally , maternal diagnosis asthma7 gestational diabetes8 male gender newborn9 associate TTN , although mechanism association incompletely understood . Although TTN exceedingly common cause newborn morbidity , relatively understudied . Due low mortality TTN little interest investigate either range pathology underlie clinical presentation TTN evidence base behind standard care treatment TTN . The high incidence TTN significant increase hospital care acuity length stay otherwise healthy infant diagnose TTN , however , indicate need study.10 As rate Cesarean section late pre-term delivery,11 well maternal morbidity asthma12 gestational diabetes,13 rise particularly important minimize morbidity cost TTN . A well understanding pathogenesis TTN thorough evaluation current treatment strategy relationship timely patient discharge sorely need . 4 . Concise statement Preliminary Data ( available ) No evidence base underlies current fluid management neonate TTN . Data exist demonstrate inefficacy loop diuretic treatment pulmonary fluid overload newborn TTN,14 systematic evaluation intravenous fluid management exist . Exclusively breastfed baby typically minimal fluid intake first four day life lactogenesis II ( initial postpartum milk production ) proceeds . Enteral intake term infant begin less 100mL first day ( equivalent 40mL/kg 2.5kg neonate ; represent term newborn 5th percentile 34 week gestational age newborn 70th percentile weight ) increase gradually milk production reach sustenance level , usually around fourth day life.15 Regardless gestational age , neonate lose water weight first week life physiologic diuresis extracellular fluid accumulate throughout gestation.16 Current management preterm term neonate include effort facilitate physiologic diuresis gradually increase amount IV fluid maintenance level reach third fifth day life . 17 , 18 5 . Research Design Methods In study , conduct prospective study 68 neonate bear 34 42 week gestation diagnose TTN manage Mount Sinai Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) . The study period include first three day ( 72 hour ) life . On admission NICU , parent consent child 's inclusion study . If consent give , child randomize `` standard fluid '' `` physiologic fluid '' group . `` Standard fluid '' refer current standard clinical practice IV fluid administration , base experimental evidence . `` Physiologic fluid '' refers IV fluid amount similar fluid volume typically ingested initiation breastfeeding . Term infant assign `` standard fluid '' group start 60 mL/kg/day glucose-containing intravenous fluid standard practice . Term infant assign `` physiologic fluid '' group start 40 mL/kg/day glucose-containing intravenous fluid . Late preterm infant ( gestational age 34 37 week ) assign `` standard fluid '' group start 80 mL/kg/day glucose-containing intravenous fluid standard practice . Late preterm infant ( gestational age 34 37 week ) assign `` physiologic fluid '' group start 60 mL/kg/day glucose-containing intravenous fluid . For group , intravenous fluid rate increase 20 mL/kg/day daily , current standard practice . Consistent current standard management newborns respiratory distress , infant allow take oral nutrition respiratory distress abates . Newborns carefully monitor , infant `` physiologic fluid '' group remove study total daily fluid increase show sign dehydration . Primary outcome duration respiratory distress , define respiratory rate consistently great 50 breaths/minute oxygen saturation room air consistently less 95 % . Secondary outcome length time first oral feed time discharge intensive care unit . This research pose minor increase minimal risk subject enrol intervention group . The anticipated risk include mild dehydration and/or hypoglycemia neonate `` physiologic fluid '' intervention group . This risk minor newborn NICU urine output record every three hour , point-of-care glucose monitoring admission least every twelve hour thereafter , serum electrolyte check 12 24 hour life . If neonatal dehydration note defined urine output &lt; 2mL/kg/hour twelve hour period , serum sodium &lt; 130 mEq/L &gt; 150 mEq/L , weight loss 10 % birth weight , blood glucose point-of-care test &lt; 40 mg/dL , child remove study appropriate fluid resuscitation initiate . These guideline removal study conservative criterion use rehydration clinical care , long-term adverse sequela level brief mild dehydration hypoglycemia expect .</detailed_description>
