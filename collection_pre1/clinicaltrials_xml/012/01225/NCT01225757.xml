	<brief_summary>Cytoreductive surgery hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) perform patient peritoneal tumor . Classically , procedure prolong duration involve significant fluid shift . Patients receive large amount volume replacement procedure ( 10 20 liter ) . The traditional method monitor adequacy volume replacement measurement urine output central venous pressure . There drawbacks method intravascular volume status measurement may lead replacement fluid . If fluid replacement underestimate , patient may suffer adverse effect hypotension renal dysfunction . However , excessive administration fluid may lead adverse event , include cardiac dysrhythmias heart failure . The hypothesis study patient volume status maintain utilizing transesophageal echocardiogram well maintenance fluid status avoid intravascular volume overload .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Traditional Echocardiography Guided Fluid Management During Cytoreductive Surgery With HIPEC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cytoreductive surgery hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) procedure peritoneal surface tumor remove followed infusion heat chemotherapeutic solution abdominal cavity . This procedure typically 6-10 hour duration accompany significant fluid shift hemodynamic change . Patients frequently receive 10 20 liter fluid procedure . Patients undergo cytoreductive surgery HIPEC also experience vasodilatation hyperdynamic cardiac state hyperthermic period . Classically , need volume replacement guide follow patient 's urine output ( UOP ) use central venous pressure ( CVP ) . However , several study show CVP reliable measure intravascular fluid status . We hypothesize patient undergo echocardiography guide anesthesia management ( EGAM ) receive significantly less fluid operative period compare traditional fluid therapy guide monitoring urine output central venous pressure . In addition primary endpoint decrease fluid administration , would predict decrease time extubation , intensive care unit length stay , hospital length stay , post operative oxygen requirement , post operative complication include tachyarrhythmias , heart failure pulmonary edema , length time recovery bowel function . Patients present cytoreductive surgery HIPEC randomize one two group , echocardiography guide fluid management group traditional CVP/UOP fluid guide group . For patient echocardiography arm , monitor use optimize preload , contractility , heart rate cardiac output . Patients CVP/UOP arm receive current standard fluid administration maintain adequate urine output . All patient present procedure offer opportunity admission study . Exclusion criterion include absolute contraindication transesophageal echocardiography , include cervical spine instability , esophageal stricture , webs ring , patient refusal , esophageal perforation , obstructive esophageal neoplasm ( Savage 2004 ) . A follow-up evaluation complete remainder patient 's hospitalization evaluate previously discuss endpoint . The goal determine optimal fluid management strategy decrease morbidity post-operative period patient undergo cytoreductive surgery hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
