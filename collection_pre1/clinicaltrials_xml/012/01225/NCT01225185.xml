	<brief_summary>Neurological injury elective shoulder surgery beach chair position think result cerebral hypoperfusion therefore preventable appropriate hemodynamic monitoring management . This proposal use system continuously monitor cerebral blood flow autoregulation identify safe arterial blood pressure target patient beach chair position , compare control cohort orthopedic surgery lateral decubitus supine position . Autoregulation data compare new , highly specific sensitive serum biomarker neurologic injury , glial fibrillary acid protein , postoperative neurocognitive testing result .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Cerebral Blood Flow Autoregulation During Surgery Head-up Position</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurologic injury general anesthesia beach chair position believe result cerebral hypoperfusion.1 We hypothesize brain hypoperfusion circumstance cause blood pressure monitor reflect cerebral perfusion pressure . Maintenance arterial blood pressure individual 's low limit cerebral blood flow autoregulation would prevent devastate complication . Near infrared spectroscopy use continuously monitor autoregulation cerebral oximetry index ( COx ) , move linear correlation coefficient cortical tissue oxygen saturation arterial pressure . We hypothesize subject beach chair position impair cerebral blood flow autoregulation compare subject undergo surgery lateral decubitus supine position . We test hypothesis compare CBF autoregulation data , include percentage time patient undergo elective surgery abnormal autoregulation , beach chair position versus supine position . We establish range arterial pressure require maintain autoregulation two group . Cerebral autoregulation result assess relationship postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction serum glial fibrillary acid protein level , biomarker brain injury . The specific aim study : 1 . To compare average cerebral oximetry index percentage time abnormal COx subject head supine position surgery general anesthesia . 2 . To compare range arterial blood pressure require normal cerebral oximetry index subject anesthetize head supine position . 3 . To assess association impaired cerebral blood flow autoregulation postoperative neurocognitive decline 1 month surgery perioperative elevation serum glial fibrillary acid protein . Monitoring autoregulation non-invasively COx potential improve patient safety delineate individualized limit safe ABP patient risk neurologic injury .</detailed_description>

Women child bear potential require negative urine HCG test enrol . Patients unable attend postoperative cognitive testing session exclude study know allergy adhesive tape .</criteria>
