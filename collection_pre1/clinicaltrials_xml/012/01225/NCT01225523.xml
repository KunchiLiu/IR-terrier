	<brief_title>Perioperative Vs. Preoperative Chemotherapy With Surgery Squamous Carcinoma Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perioperative chemotherapy show significantly improve R0 resection rate , disease free survival overall survival patient adenocarcinoma esophagus , gastroesophageal junction stomach . Therefore , perioperative chemotherapy new therapeutic standard ( Cunningham NEJM 2006 , MRC , Lancet 2002 , Boige ASCO 2007 ) . The best-evaluated regime combination Epirubicin , Cisplatin 5-FU ( ECF ) ( Cunningham , NEJM 2007 ) . Cisplatin 5-FU consider important component form cornerstone regime . Paclitaxel new highly active cytotoxic agent . In randomized phase II study , dual combination Paclitaxel 5-FU seem show similar effect ECF , administer first line treatment . The triplet combination Paclitaxel , Cisplatin 5-FU significantly superior efficacy combination Cisplatin und 5-FU ( Van Cutsem , JCO 2007 ) . It show Capecitabine active 5-FU replace intravenous 5-FU combination Cisplatin treatment esophageal cancer . Capecitabine therefore FDA approve esophageal cancer ( Cunningham , ASCO 2006 , Kang ASCO 2006 ) .It seem reasonable optimize perioperative chemotherapy include modern chemotherapeutics . In study , patient squamous carcinoma esophagus gastroesophageal junction seem operable curative intent accord oncological surgical assessment treat 2 preoperative cycle PCF follow surgical resection , follow 2 postoperative cycle PCF . Among patient response preoperative chemotherapy , Capecitabine 625 mg/m² twice-daily dose define alternative infuse 5-Fluorouracil postoperative chemotherapy regimen Postoperative chemotherapy start within 4-6 week operation . 3 week end last chemotherapy final investigation ( end study visit ) do .</detailed_description>
