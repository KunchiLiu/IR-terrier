	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study ARQ 736 Adult Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring BRAF and/or NRAS Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment initiate dose level 450 mg twice daily ( 900 mg/daily ) . All cycles/cohorts therapy consist oral administration ARQ 736 twice four time day , one hour prior two hour meal 28 day continuously . Tumor assessment ( CT scan MRI ) perform Baseline , every two cycle ( every eight week ) thereafter otherwise clinically indicate . For early assessment evidence biological activity tumor PET scan may perform Baseline four week administration first dose ARQ 736 ( approximately Cycle 2 Day1 ) .</detailed_description>
