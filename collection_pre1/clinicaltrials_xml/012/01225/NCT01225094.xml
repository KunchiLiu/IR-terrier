	<brief_title>Curcumin Prevent Complications After Elective Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm ( AAA ) Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) balloon abdominal aorta , major blood vessel body . AAA occur 2 % adult . Surgeons plan AAA repair aneurysm grow big 5.5cm , AAA might burst without repair . Over 47,000 AAA repair perform year . Despite benefit AAA repair risk , kidney severely injured . We test whether natural health product curcumin effect biomarkers inflammation , kidney injury heart injury AAA repair . Curcumin appear fight oxidation inflammation , way body injured surgery . We study 600 patient elective AAA repair . The patient receive either curcumin match placebo . We recruit 600 patient 10 centre Ontario . This study help u determine whether curcumin exerts biological effect biomarkers whether well tolerate . If evidence beneficial effect 600 patient trial , justify future large trial ass effect curcumin outcome important patient , family healthcare provider .</detailed_description>
