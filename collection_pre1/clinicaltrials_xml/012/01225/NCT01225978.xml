	<detailed_description>A . Specific Aims Aim 1 : To assess usability successive version EHR genetic display screen variant-based patient search functionality . Formal usability study conduct new release GeneInsight Clinic ( GIC ) application order maximize effectiveness efficiency , user satisfaction . Results study use along functional technical requirement design enhancement successive version software . Hypothesis : The usability GeneInsight Clinic application 's effectiveness , efficiency , user satisfaction improve successive version . Aim 2 . To assess decision-making process associate issue alert relate new knowledge germline variant . Changes cardiomyopathy hearing loss variant level information place queue evaluation . A board-certified clinical laboratory geneticist determine change release `` alert '' result update GIC notification clinician . This decision-making process evaluate . Hypothesis : Evaluation decision-making regard release genetic variant update alert identify patient physician characteristic , level significance genetic variant update influence alert decision . Aim 3 . To measure impact efficiency new genetic knowledge incorporate clinical care result improve genetic IT infrastructure support . Currently , clinician learn germline genetic variant update choose call genetic laboratory check possible new information genetic test interest . With GIC alert system , treat clinician proactively receive genetic variant update relevant patient . For cancer genotyping test , associate variant determine clinical significance , treat oncologist interested identify patient variant evaluate whether patient 's care plan modify . With GIC patient search functionality , treat clinician able identify patient genetic variant interest . Hypothesis : The availability GIC tool greatly reduce time delay associate distribute updated variant information treat clinician reduce number call Laboratory Molecular Medicine ( LMM ) receive request variant update . The efficiency identify patient clinically significant variant improve use PGE tool . Aim 4 : To evaluate satisfaction treat clinician , perceive impact clinical care , net effect clinician workload associate deploying genetic infrastructure . Hypothesis : The introduction subsequent revision PGE tool result improved satisfaction , perceive reduction clinician workload , perceive improvement clinical care .</detailed_description>
