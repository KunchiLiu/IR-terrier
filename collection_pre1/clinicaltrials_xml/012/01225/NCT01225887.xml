	<brief_title>Nintedanib Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate proportion patient persistent recurrent endometrial cancer , survive progression-free without go subsequent therapy disease least 6 month proportion patient objective tumor response ( complete partial ) , treat BIBF 1120 ( nintedanib ) . II . To determine nature degree toxicity BIBF 1120 cohort patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient persistent recurrent endometrial cancer treat BIBF 1120 . OUTLINE : Patients receive nintedanib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
