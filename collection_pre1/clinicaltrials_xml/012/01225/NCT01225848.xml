	<brief_title>Trial Maintenance SU011248 Versus Placebo Post Chemotherapy Patients With Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study compare progression rate associate SU011248 versus Placebo patient advance urothelial carcinoma achieve least stable disease follow combination chemotherapy . Secondary objective trial : We explore safety SU011248 , assess objective response rate associate SU011248 therapy patient stable disease chemotherapy , assess median survival patient advance urothelial carcinoma treat SU011248 placebo follow chemotherapy . Correlative objective trial : To correlate change VEGF sVEGFR-2 level clinical response patient advance urothelial carcinoma . Tertiary objective trial : Determine response progression rate SU011248 patient cross treatment placebo .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic/cytologic diagnosis urothelial carcinoma ( tranisitional cell carcinoma either pure mixed histology ) . All patient must receive four six cylces standard first line chemotherapy ( see appendix A suggested combination ) treatment locally recurrent metastatic disease must achieve stable disease ( SD ) , partial response ( PR ) , complete response ( CR ) chemotherapy . Patient must register within month ( next business day fall weekend holiday ) scan demonstrate stable disease well 42 day receive last standard chemotherapy dose . patient may receive previous adjuvant neoadjuvant therapy . No prior antiangiogenic therapy stage disease . An ECOG performance status 02 life expectancy great 6 month . If patient receive radiation therapy , must recover side effect registration study . No prior malignancy allow , except adequately treat basal cell ( squamouscell ) skin cancer situ carcinoma site adequately treated malignancy patient currently disease free least one year . Patients prostate cancer diagnose time cystectomy undetectable PSA without hormonal therapy eligible . Timing guideline prestudy labs measurement : All prestudy lab require determination eligibility complete within 14 day prior registration . Xrays and/or scan use tumor measurement determine disease status EKG , MUGA complete within one month prior registration . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define obtain within 14 day registration . All patient must inform investigational nature study must sign informed consent accordance institutional federal guideline . Exclusion Criteria Major surgery within 4 week start study treatment . NCI CTCAE grade 3 hemorrhage high within 4 week start study treatment . History known spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis , evidence symptomatic brain leptomeningeal disease screen CT MRI scan . However treat , stable asymptomatic brain metastasis allow . Known HIV positive patient may participate . This avoid additional complication immune supression HIV infection may cause due tothe intense nature chemotherapy trial . Any follow within 6 month prior study drug administration : myocardial infraction , severe/unstable angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack , pulmonary embolism . Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias NCI CTCAE grade &gt; 2 . Patients history suspect CHF include long asymptomatic ejection fraction equal institutional low limit normal baseline MUGA . QTc interval &gt; 500 msec baseline EKG . Hypertension control medication ( &gt; 150/11 mm Hg despite optimal medical therapy ) . Patients preexist thyroid function abnormality control medically . Patients may unresolved bacterial infection . Concurrent treatment another clinical trial . Supportive care trial nontreatment trial , e.g . QOL , allow . Pregnancy brestfeeding . Female subject must surgically sterile postmenopausal , must agree use effective contraception period therapy . All female subject reproductive potential must negative pregnancy test ( serum urine ) prior enrollment . Male subject must surgically sterile must agree use effective contraception period therapy . The definition effective contraception base judgement principal investigator designate associate . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormally may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgement investigator would make subject inappropriate entry thid study .</criteria>
