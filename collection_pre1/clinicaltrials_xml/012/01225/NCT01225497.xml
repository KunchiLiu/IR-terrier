	<brief_summary>Chronic pain disability unfortunately common Achilles tendon pain . Outcome surgery often poor . Also tendon pain resistant treatment may lead cessation hobby career . Recently eccentric exercise ( defined muscle load tension develop physical lengthening occurs ) become cornerstone manage tendon pain due increase amount favorable research . Eccentric exercise consider non-invasive , safe , appear important successful outcome . One exercise program extensively adopt research clinical practice Achilles pain . It recommend individual perform 180 repetition day . However appear little scientific rationale number . Consequently may significant implication patient compliance , satisfaction , overall treatment efficacy strategy encourage uncomfortable . Fifty two adult ( 18-70 year old ) , mid-Achilles tendon pain randomised standard treatment ( 180 repetition ) group individual allow . Participants recruit participate physiotherapy department ( health centre hospital department ) across NHS Forth Valley . All individual require complete type eccentric exercise six week attend initial assessment two follow-up appointment three six week . Thereafter participant discharge well , continue individual care appropriate . It hop pilot study establish future large scale investigation warrant examine whether necessary subject individual 180 repetition day activity recommend uncomfortable . Also participant satisfaction differ exercise group ? If investigation warrant pilot may provide population specific data future sample size calculation , may provide suitable methodology investigation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eccentric Exercise Chronic Mid-portion Achilles Tendinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : This project prospective double-blinded randomised clinical control trial compare `` standard '' volume eccentric exercise program ( Group I-Control ) versus participant determine volume program ( Group II-Experimental ) . Participants Participant population The participant population interest attend NHS out-patient physiotherapy department treatment chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy Scotland . Consequently gender vary pre-morbid activity level anticipate across wide age range . Participant recruitment selection Physiotherapy colleague across Forth Valley NHS Trust contact via standardised email inviting individual participate propose investigation . Those volunteer required identify potential participant currently wait attend physiotherapy . Such waiting list include self-referral , orthopaedic GP referral . Once identify potential participant send standardised letter introduction identify may eligible participate research project concern physiotherapy treatment Achilles tendon pain . More detailed participant information sheet also include allow candidate best opportunity provide inform consent . Any potential risk outline . As part inform consent process participant encourage seek opinion friend family . Participant recruitment implement 4 month period . Potential participant instruct receive appointment due course location would normally attend . On initial contact participant assess per normal practice participate physiotherapist health centre hospital would normally attend attempt minimise disruption patient journey . It hop travel minimise participant order minimise drop participant expense . In instance diagnosis uncertain participate therapist advise seek second opinion appropriate colleagues/senior clinical staff would normal circumstance . If diagnosis Achilles tendinopathy still uncertain potential participant include inform . Participating therapist undergo train obtain informed consent ; diagnose Achilles tendinopathy define follow inclusion criterion ; receive instruction data collection procedure require investigation principle researcher . Again potential risk outline process obtain informed consent . Participants give time consider option . It make clear deciding participate affect future treatment . If potential participant agree take part , eligibility participate assess follow criterion . If potential participant suitable randomise either group . Participants remind right withdraw trial anytime affect future treatment . If necessary withdrawal participant inform request see different physiotherapist wish . If individual fulfil selection criterion inform immediately manage per normal . Sampling technique It anticipate sample size require obtain . Nevertheless , due uncertain incidence rate limit time convenience sample use maximise recruitment . Participant randomisation Once recruit , participant randomise control group ( `` standard '' volume ) experimental group ( patient determine volume ) . Randomisation achieve participate physiotherapist telephone recruit Stirling Royal Infirmary physiotherapy department secretary end initial consultation . The secretary randomly draw seal opaque envelope detail number repetition per day inform participant directly . As well write documentation provide initial consultation participant remind discuss volume repetition anyone potentially participate trial participate therapist duration test . In way participant , participate therapist researcher blind group allocation . Any question participant may direct independent supervisor project ( Frank Gilroy , Physiotherapy Manager , Forth Valley NHS Trust ) . Sample size calculation The VISA-A suggest valid reliable therefore strongly recommend use research treat Achilles tendon pain ( Robinson 2001 ; Brukner &amp; Khan 2007 ) . Thus used principle outcome measure investigation . Previous research suggest delta 10 point standard deviation 12 compare eccentric exercise wait see approach ( Rompe et al 2008 ) give large effect size 0.83 . With power 0.80 , alpha level 0.05 , use method outline Fleiss ( 1986 ) calculate 23 participant require group trial . All study area assign additional 10 % calculated sample size account loss follow-up ( Rompe et al 2007 ) . This appear adequate propose population set study fail recruit require number ensure adequate power . Therefore total 26 patient require arm trial . Procedure Participants assess , recruit randomise detailed previously . All participant instruct eccentric exercise technique per previous literature ( Alfredson et al 1998 ) . Advice concern progression , exercise pain consistent across group recommend Alfredson et al ( 1998 ) . All participant also receive write instruction perform progress exercise well simple exercise diary record number repetition actually complete per day . During initial consultation data collection sheet complete appropriate . At end initial consultation participate therapist phone Stirling Royal Infirmary physiotherapy department recruit secretary inform patient directly number exercise day ( part randomisation process ) . A follow-up appointment arrange three week . At week three exercise review ensure good technique . All outcome measure re-assessed document data collection sheet . At week six outcome measure re-assessed . Patient satisfaction treatment assess . All complete data collection sheet exercise activity log mail principle investigator analysis . At point participant inform trial management continue per normal practice . If symptom resolve participant may discharge ; improve may give open appointment advice contact problem ; little change therapist allow continue management see fit per normal practice . At end trial principle researcher attempt contact participant lose follow-up determine reason long agree consent process .</detailed_description>
