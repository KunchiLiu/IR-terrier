	<brief_summary>Objective ( ) The primary study objective assess antiviral effect 12 week adefovir dipivoxil treatment Korean patient chronic hepatitis B compensate liver disease . The secondary study objective assess antiviral effect , clinical benefit safety 52 week adefovir dipivoxil treatment . Endpoint ( ) The primary efficacy endpoint `` Mean log10 reduction serum HBV DNA level baseline Week 12 '' . The secondary efficacy endpoint include ( ) proportion patient achieve serum ALT normalization Week 52 , ( b ) assessments antiviral effect ( proportion patient achieve HBV DNA le 300 copy per mL Week 52 ) , ( c ) HBeAg loss , HBeAg seroconversion , HBsAg loss HBsAg seroconversion , ( ) proportion patient achieve serum ALT normalization Week 12 . Study Design This open label , multi centre phase IV study Korean patient chronic hepatitis B compensate liver disease , assess antiviral effect 12 week treatment Adefovir dipivoxil primary objective antiviral effect , clinical benefit safety 52 week treatment secondary objective . Patients screen eligibility criterion baseline visit treatment initiation occur 4 week screen . Total treatment period 52 week patient return clinic assessment schedule treatment period . After 52 week study period , likely patient benefit continue treatment commercial adefovir . If investigator 's clinical judgement case , investigator ensure routine prescription available timely manner , unnecessary interruption treatment occur . Study Population A minimum 100 male female Korean patient 18 year age HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B compensate liver disease meet eligibility criterion enrol . Study Assessments Procedures Potential patient screen prior study entry eligible patient give consent baseline assessment . Following screening , first dos study medication give baseline patient return clinic assessment schedule treatment period . Patients discontinue treatment prematurely follow every 4 week 12 week follow withdrawal visit . The following key assessment measurement make one visit study . ( See section 14.1 Appendix 1 . Time event schedule ) : - Pregnancy test ( females child-bearing potential ) - Haematology serum chemistry profile include prothrombin time ( PT ) AFP - HBV DNA ( Roche COBAS AMPLICOR HBV MONITOR Test , LLOD 300 copy per ml ) - Hepatitis B marker : HBeAg ( Anti HBe test HBeAg negative ) , HBsAg ( Anti HBs test HBsAg negative ) Investigational Product ( ) Adefovir dipivoxil 10mg tablet supply GlaxoSmithKline present white white , round tablet , package bottle contain 30 tablet</brief_summary>
