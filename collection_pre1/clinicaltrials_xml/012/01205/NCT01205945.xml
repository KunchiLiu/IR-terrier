	<brief_summary>Abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) occur infrarenal aorta expand maximal diameter 3.0cm great . Although AAA may asymptomatic many year , almost one third eventually rupture leave untreated . Several randomized trial show ultrasonographic screening AAA could reduce frequency acute operation AAA-related mortality . However , randomize trial perform Western country . There randomized trial AAA screen Asian country . This randomize , control trial analyze benefit screen old population AAA Korea .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Old population , age 60 85 year , randomize two group ; one group invite ultrasonographic screening AAA , act age- sex-matched control . For screen group , The anterioposterior transverse diameter infrarenal aorta measure maximal size . The subsequent surveillance screen patient do follow - Aortic diameter less 3.0cm , test - AAA 3 4cm , ultrasonographic follow-up every year - AAA 4 5cm , ultrasonographic follow-up every 6 month - AAA great 5cm , referral vascular surgeon For control group , information cause death collect every year .</detailed_description>
