	<brief_summary>This study test safety drug call lapatinib well work . Lapatinib ( also call Tyverb Tykerb ) compare another drug trastuzumab ( also call Herceptin ) . Trastuzumab antibody HER2 protein . It bind part HER2 protein stop work . Clinical trial find add trastuzumab chemotherapy lower rate cancer recurrence improve survival woman HER2 positive breast cancer . Lapatinib also stop HER2 protein work may slow stop cancer cell grow may prevent cancer return . Lapatinib approve country treat patient certain type breast cancer . However lapatinib approve treat early breast cancer . This study one many carry involve lapatinib early breast cancer study show promising treatment . This study compare lapatinib trastuzumab . One group people take lapatinib another group take trastuzumab . The effect drug , good bad , compare . This study compare two different duration HER2 treatment see early introduction HER2 treatment beneficial . The lapatinib group receive HER2 treatment begin 24 week prior surgery trastuzumab group receive HER2 therapy 12 week prior surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , parallel-arm , open-label , multicentre , Phase II study determine efficacy safety lapatinib combination epirubicin cyclophosphamide ( EC90-L ) follow paclitaxel lapatinib ( PX-L ) compare EC90 follow paclitaxel trastuzumab ( PX-T ) systemic neoadjuvant therapy patient previously untreated , operable , ErbB2-overexpressing , Stage I- IIIA breast cancer . Approximately 164 subject enrol study . Subjects randomise 1:1 ratio stratify accord follow factor , must establish prior commence randomisation : - Tumour size ( ≤ 2 cm versus &gt; 2 cm diameter ) . - Locally determine ER status ( either ER positive negative ) . Patients randomise one two treatment arm receive follow study treatment : Arm A : Experimental Arm ( n=82 ) Part I ( Week 1-12 ) Epirubicin 90 mg/m2 IV infusion Day 1 every 21 day Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 IV infusion Day 1 every 21 day Lapatinib 1000 mg orally daily continuously Loperamide require proactive management diarrhoea ( see Section 5.13.6 ) Part II ( Week 13-24 ) Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV infusion Day 1 week Lapatinib 1000 mg orally daily continuously Loperamide require proactive management diarrhoea ( see Section 5.13.6 ) Arm B : Reference Arm ( n=82 ) : Part I ( Week 1-12 ) Epirubicin 90 mg/m2 IV infusion Day 1 every 21 day Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 IV infusion Day 1 every 21 day Part II ( Week 13-24 ) Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV infusion Day 1 week Trastuzumab 4 mg/kg IV load follow 2 mg/kg IV Day 1 week The primary study period include screen phase , administration randomize neo-adjuvant study treatment , assessment primary endpoint assessment time definitive breast cancer surgery .</detailed_description>
