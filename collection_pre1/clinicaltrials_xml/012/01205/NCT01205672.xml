	<brief_title>Evaluation Molecular Effects Metformin Endometrium Patients With Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Metformin design treat diabetes insulin resistance . Both diabetes insulin resistance link endometrial cancer . Although diagnosis diabetes , metformin may still affect cancer cell . Study Visit ( take Metformin ) : If find eligible take part study , study visit begin take Metformin . The following test procedure perform : - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect research look different hormone level . - If need , fast glucose level obtain . - If find eligible blood , urine , tissue research discard . Study Drug Administration : You take metformin , mouth , 1 time morning , breakfast , least 7 day 30 day schedule surgery perform . You record date time take metformin study drug calendar provide study staff . You take metformin day surgery . Study Tests ( day surgery ) : You bring study drug calendar clinic day surgery . The following test procedure also perform : - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test check different hormone level . - During surgery , second endometrial biopsy biomarker test . Length Study : You study surgical procedure . This investigational study . Up 30 woman take part study . Up 25 participant take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
