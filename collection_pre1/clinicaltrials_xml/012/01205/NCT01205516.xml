	<brief_summary>INTRODUCTION : There important need inexpensive drug treat neuropathic pain . Early research suggest methadone may good , inexpensive drug treat neuropathic pain . Methadone available low cost powder easily prepare different route administration . This study look effect safety methadone compare regular treatment morphine treatment chronic neuropathic pain . OBJECTIVES : First investigator want determine methadone effective safe treatment neuropathic pain . Since placebo control group would unethical , propose comparator consist `` gold standard '' conventional treatment , control release morphine . The investigator compare methadone controlled-release morphine regard affect level pain extent side effect . Next investigator want examine safety well determine whether methadone lead improvement physical emotional functioning , participant ' satisfaction treatment . METHODS : A double blind , randomize trial compare methadone control release morphine propose . After 1-week , participant randomly assign either methadone control release morphine gradually build dose receive adequate pain relief without unacceptable level side effect . This 5-week phase follow 6-week dose phase 4-week tapering phase . Study drug : The study drug methadone supply 2.5 mg tablet . The comparator consist control release morphine 10 mg tablet . The dose range 1-12 tablet take every 12 hour ( dose range methadone 5-60 mg/day , control release morphine 20-240 mg/day ) . Setting : This 3-site study involve pain clinic Halifax , Nova Scotia ; London , Ontario ; Calgary , Alberta .</brief_summary>
