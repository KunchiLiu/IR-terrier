	<detailed_description>TMC435 investigate treatment chronic HCV infection , combination Peg-IFN ( pegylated interferon ) RBV ( ribavirin ) . About 30 % HIV infect patient co-infected HCV need treatment infection . The result study provide dose recommendation coadministration TMC435 TMC278 Tenofovir HCV-HCV co-infected patient . This Phase I , open-label ( participant investigator know name medication give certain moment ) , randomize ( sequence treatment study medication assign chance ) , crossover trial 48 healthy participant investigate pharmacokinetic interaction TMC435 antiretroviral agent ( TMC278 tenofovir ) , steady state . The participant allocate one two panel . In Panel 1 , participant receive three treatment ( treatment A-B-C ) randomize order . Participants receive TMC435 150 mg q.d. , TMC278 25 mg q.d.and TMC278 25 mg q.d . + TMC435 150 mg q.d. , respectively . All treatment administer 11 day food . There washout period ( period study drug take view medication eliminate body start new treatment ) least 14 day last intake study medication one session first intake study medication subsequent session . In Panel 2 , participant receive three treatment ( treatment D-E-F ) randomize order . Participants receive TMC435 150 mg q.d. , TDF 300 mg q.d . TDF 300 mg q.d . + TMC435 150 mg q.d. , respectively . All treatment administer 7 day food . There washout period least 7 day . Pharmacokinetic profile three compound determine blood sample take regular interval study . Safety tolerability assess study period follow-up . Blood urine sample , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) vital sign ( blood pressure heart rate ) take screening , medication intake day 1 11 Day 12 session Panel 1 , medication intake day 1 7 Day 8 session Panel 2 , 5 hour post dose Day11 Day 7 Panel 1 2 , respectively 2 follow visit 1 week 4-5 week last dose study medication last session . A physical examination perform screening , day -1 ( = day first medication intake session panel ) 2 follow visit . Each volunteer receive 3 treatment 11 7 day ( Panel 1 2 , respectively ) , minimum 14 7 day apart ( Panel 1 2 , respectively ) . Volunteers Panel 1 take oral TMC435 150 mg q.d. , oral TMC278 25 mg q.d . combine . Volunteers Panel 2 take oral TMC435 150 mg q.d. , oral TDF 300 mg q.d . combine .</detailed_description>
