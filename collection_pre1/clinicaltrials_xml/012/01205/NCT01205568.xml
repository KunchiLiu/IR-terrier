	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate safety efficacy transcatheter Cutting Balloon therapy branch pulmonary artery stenosis resistant low pressure dilation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cutting Balloon Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study prospective , multi-center , randomize , blind trial compare 2 treatment pulmonary artery stenosis . Specifically , vessel fail respond balloon inflation 8 ATM individually randomize 1 2 treatment pathway . In first treatment pathway , vessel dilate use CB , follow additional low pressure balloon dilation ( &lt; 8ATM ) . In second pathway , vessel dilate high pressure balloon angioplasty , balloon inflation pressure exceed 15 ATM . Cross-over therapy permit failed high pressure treatment start enrollment patient # 15 . The primary outcome assessment efficacy comparison percent change minimum lumen diameter randomize therapy , determine core laboratory blind pathway assignment . The primary outcome assessment safety comparison proportion vessel dilation result serious adverse event , determine Data Safety Monitoring Board . Patient-level safety endpoint also tabulate . Patients multiple vessel enrol ; analytical technique adjust potential intra-patient correlation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient Inclusion Criteria ( Determined Prior Cardiac Catheterization ) . At least 1 branch pulmonary artery stenosis refer planned catheterization PA dilation b . At least one following : i.greater one half systemic right ventricular pressure ii . regional decrease pulmonary blood flow lung scan iii . elevate pulmonary artery pressure ( &gt; 20 mmHg MPAP ) iv . cyanosis least part due PA stenosis c. Informed consent patient and/or parent/guardian ; assent mature minor d. Agreement participate protocol , include followup test Vessel Inclusion Criteria ( Determined During Cardiac Catheterization ) 1 . Native pulmonary artery branch fail balloon dilation 8 ATM ; define failure eliminate waist 2 . Native pulmonary artery branch balloon waist diameter le 7.5 mm ( i.e.,0.5 mm less large available CB ) dilation 8 ATM 3 . All eligible vessel dilate catheterization must enrol study vessel ; `` offstudy '' use Cutting Balloons high pressure dilation eligible vessel allow . 3 . Patient Exclusion Criteria ( Determined Prior Cardiac Catheterization ) 1 . Prior pulmonary artery angioplasty surgery vessel within previous 6 week 2 . Pregnancy Vessel Exclusion Criteria ( Determined During Cardiac Catheterization ) 1 . Vessel aneurysm prior dilation surgery , define local enlargement vessel great 100 % lumen diameter proximally distally aneurysm . The maximum aneurysm diameter vessel lumen diameter proximal distal aneurysm record . The location aneurysm relative angioplasty site determine report proximal , distal , region waist formation . 2 . Prior stent placement associate obstruction i. balloon inflation purpose expand diameter stent along length residual waist proximal distal stent edge ii . balloon inflation result waist formation within edge stent iii . dilation vessel cell stent c. Unifocalized nonunifocalized systemic pulmonary artery collateral . d. A vessel require therapy site amenable delivery safe positioning Cutting Balloon device due unfavorable anatomy determine physician base assessment vessel angle , size , length , proximity vessel .</criteria>
