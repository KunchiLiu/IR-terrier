	<brief_title>Effects Doxycycline Persistent Symptoms Post-neuroborreliosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persistent symptom treatment neuroborreliosis ( NB ) uncommon . There currently evidence improvement symptom repeat prolonged antibiotic treatment . However , clinical observation indicate patient improve treatment doxycycline ( DOX ) , regain symptoms time complete treatment . This may due immunomodulatory effect drug . The aim randomise , double-blind crossover study determine whether DOX impact persistent symptom alteration immune response whether effect influence clinical outcome . A total 15 patient South-East Sweden previously adequately diagnosed NB diverse persistent symptom â‰¥6months antibiotic treatment randomise double-blind , crossover fashion receive either DOX 200 mg placebo ( PBO ) daily three week , follow wash-out period six week three-weeks treatment either DOX 200 mg PBO daily three week . The primary outcome measure improvement persistent symptom physical mental health , evaluate use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey ( SF-36 ) physical examination special emphasis neurologic status follow-up visit . Secondary outcome measure change drug-induced antigen-stimulated unstimulated cytokine response .</detailed_description>
