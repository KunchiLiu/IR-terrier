	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether drug mesna able block series chemical change occur blood patient receive chemotherapy medicine doxorubicin . The researcher believe blood chemical change may cause `` cloudy thinking '' `` chemobrain '' report patient receive chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Mesna Prevent Doxorubicin-induced Plasma Protein Oxidation Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha ( TNF-α ) Release</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients lymphoma breast cancer receive chemotherapy regimen include anthracycline drug , doxorubicin , risk develop cognitive cardiac impairment . This potential cognitive impairment refer `` chemobrain '' patient . We demonstrate mice drug mesna , use prevent complication chemotherapy drug , prevents certain type doxorubicin-induced damage blood protein . Blocking doxorubicin 's damage blood protein blunt prevented subsequent marker neurologic cardiac injury mouse . This clinical trial determine mesna prevent doxorubicin-induced damage blood protein cancer patient , may establish blood protein injury first step anthracycline-induced cognitive cardiac dysfunction use drug mesna blunt prevent change blood marker injury patient cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically cytologically confirm breast cancer nonhodgkin lymphoma independent protocol eligibility determine require one chemotherapy regimens listed Participants must require standardofcare treatment chemotherapy regimen include one follow combination : doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 ; doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 , cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 , docetaxel 75 mg/m2 ; doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 , cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 , vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 ( cap 2 mg dose ) , prednisone 100 mg +/ rituximab 375 mg/m2 Age &gt; 18 years.Because treatment regimens rarely use pediatric oncology , child exclude study eligible future pediatric phase 2 trial . Life expectancy great 6 month . Zubrod performance score 2 well . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/microliter ( mcL ) ( unless due cancer marrow ) absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL ( unless due cancer marrow ) platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL ( unless due cancer marrow ) total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X normal institutional limit Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) /Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal leave ventricular function ≥ 50 % ejection fraction Because standard care chemotherapy agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurocognitive outcome . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition mesna agent use study ( ie . sulfur contain drug include `` sulfa antibiotic '' celecoxib ) . Patients require ongoing pharmacologic treatment dementia exclude . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study chemotherapy agent know teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother chemotherapy , breastfeed discontinue mother treated chemotherapy . HIVpositivity NOT specific exclusion criterion .</criteria>
