	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Oral Osmotic Therapeutic System ( OROS ) Hydromorphone Hydrochloride ( HCl ) Participants With Cancer Related Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind ( medical research study neither researcher participant know treatment participant receive ) , randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , multi-center ( one hospital medical school team work medical research study ) , comparative , parallel-group ( clinical trial compare response two group participant receive different treatment ) study OROS hydromorphone HCl compare oxycodone HCl controlled-release participant moderate severe cancer ( abnormal tissue grow spread body kill ) pain . The study consist 3 phase : screening period ( 14 day randomization ) , dose titration phase ( 8 day ) , dose maintenance phase ( 28 day ) . The study visit schedule weekly interval . Eligible participant randomly assign receive either hydromorphone HCl daily oxycodone HCl twice daily ( placebo administer necessary blinding ) . During titration phase , dosage hydromorphone HCl oxycodone HCl adjust upward downward achieve stable pain control . It 2 day 8 day . Participants complete dose titration enter dose maintenance phase receive study treatment 28 consecutive day . Morphine hydrochloride give rescue analgesic ( drug use control pain ) medication breakthrough pain study . Primarily efficacy evaluate measure change score Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) questionnaire item 'worst pain ' end maintenance period . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
