	<brief_title>Computed Tomography Coronary Angiography Before Stent Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) plan perform basis invasive coronary angiography provide information confine vessel lumen . This limitation may partially responsible unfavorable long term outcome complication occur patient . Additional information disease burden angiographically normal coronary segment adjacent lesion site could impact treatment strategy clinical result . Imaging modality allow lumen also vessel wall assessment include invasive ( e.g . intravascular ultrasound - IVUS ) non-invasive ( e.g . multislice compute tomography - MSCT ) method . IVUS guidance coronary intervention expensive give invasiveness related additional risk . The number patient refer coronary angiography significant stenosis diagnose MSCT rapidly increase . Most interventional cardiologist familiar coronary vessel image produce MSCT . The aim study ass analyse MSCT image PCI may impact treatment strategy immediate result . The study enroll subject significant coronary stenosis diagnose MSCT refer catheterisation laboratory invasive angiography PCI . The study participant randomize two group : Group 1 - result MSCT analyse interventional cardiologist perform angiography PCI . Based analysis preliminary procedural strategy plan ( stent diameter , decision direct stenting vs. predilatation , decision postdilation ) Group 2 - interventional cardiologist blind image obtain MSCT . The PCI procedure perform solely basis invasive coronary angiography In study group IVUS perform stent implantation . The operator blind result pre-PCI IVUS . The second IVUS perform angiographic result optimal opinion operator . The result second IVUS examination efficacy measure two compare treatment strategy .</detailed_description>
