	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Comparing Different Clinical Decision Rules Adult Pediatric Ankle Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients ankle trauma frequently present emergency department . In many institution radiography ankle foot obtain patient , although significant fracture occur 15 % . Therefore clinical decision rule develop clinically rule significant ankle fracture , thereby reduce number radiography result significant time cost saving . Up Ottawa Ankle Foot Rules clinical decision rule ankle trauma widely accept . They high sensitivity detection fracture relatively low specificity . This lead development alternative clinical decision rule claim equally high sensitivity improve specificity . These alternative mostly replicate directly compare . This researcher want study : compare different clinical decision rule regard sensitivity specificity . Radiographies ankle foot make every patient use gold standard detection fracture . Different clinical decision rule compare pediatric ( 5-15 year ) adult population ( 16 year onwards ) . The researcher consider clinical decision rule acceptable sensitivity least 95 % specificity least 25 % .</detailed_description>
