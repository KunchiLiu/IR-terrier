	<detailed_description>Background Patients experienced survive non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome often prescribe combination aspirin clopidogrel thin blood prevent acute coronary episode . Both clopidogrel aspirin may cause stomach bleeds prophylactic proton pump inhibitor frequently co-prescribed order prevent bleeds . Recent mechanistic observational study suggest proton pump inhibitor may reduce effectiveness clopidogrel patient may benefit much expect combined aspirin clopidogrel . The investigator propose cohort study patient prescribe clopidogrel + aspirin . Amongst patient investigator measure relative rate acute coronary syndrome death compare patient without proton pump inhibitor treatment . To provide complete picture risk benefit treatment investigator also measure relative rate stomach bleeds group patient . In addition , whether inhibitory effect proton pump inhibitor protective effect clopidogrel due inhibition drug metabolise enzyme explore assess effect drug inhibit enzymes . Background Clopidogrel antiplatelet drug use prevent coronary event , particularly patient already experience acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . It often use combination aspirin , due propensity drug cause gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeds , prophylactic therapy proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) frequently prescribe . Some proton pump inhibitor clopidogrel share common metabolic pathway involve cytochrome P450 2C19 isoenzyme . Clopidogrel rely P450 2C19 conversion active metabolite whilst PPIs inhibit enzyme ; recent mechanistic study suggest PPIs may reduce platelet inhibitory effect clopidogrel ( Gilard et al 2006 , Gilard et al 2008 ) . Subsequent observational study appear show effect may translate directly reduction clopidogrel efficacy patient likely experience secondary coronary event death . Odds ratios 1.25 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1.11-1.41 ; Ho et al 2009 ) 1.27 ( 1.03-1.57 ; Juurlink et al 2009 ) report , compare clopidogrel PPI user patient use clopidogrel without PPI . A study suggest effect may limit clopidogrel combination omeprazole ( Sibbing et al 2009 ) . Scientific hypothesis Main Research Questions : To investigate possible drug interaction clopidogrel proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) . Specific question answer : 1 . Does combine use clopidogrel/aspirin PPI increase risk acute coronary syndrome death compare clopidogrel/aspirin without PPI , much ? 2 . Does combine use clopidogrel/aspirin PPI decrease risk gastrointestinal bleed compare clopidogrel/aspirin without PPI much ? Objectives Using cohort method : 1 . Estimate rate ratio acute coronary syndrome death , compare individual prescribe clopidogrel + aspirin PPI individual prescribe clopidogrel + aspirin without PPI . 2 . Estimate rate ratio gastrointestinal bleed , compare individual prescribe clopidogrel + aspirin PPI individual prescribe clopidogrel + aspirin without PPI . 3 . Estimate rate ratio acute coronary syndrome death , compare individual prescribe clopidogrel + aspirin non-PPI cytochrome P450 2C19 inhibitor individual prescribe clopidogrel + aspirin without non-PPI cytochrome P450 2C19 inhibitor use cohort method Methodology plan statistical analysis A cohort study propose address issue outline . This optimum design since allow u measure relative absolute rate event interest . We also able assign follow time different exposure group dictate patient prescription . Study Population : All patient register General Practice Research Database ( GPRD ) 1998 date receive clopidogrel combination aspirin least 12 month up-to-standard observation first prescription clopidogrel eligible inclusion . Data restrict 1998 onwards year clopidogrel license United Kingdom ( UK ) . Primary Exposure : Any PPI combination aspirin clopidogrel . Prescriptions PPI 's , aspirin clopidogrel identify patient record . Primary Outcome : A combined end point cause mortality OR incident myocardial infarction ( MI ) . Mortality determine use GPRD-estimated date death incident MI determine search clinical referral record . Recent linkage GPRD Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project [ MINAP ] exploit validate event diagnose ensure event incident rather prevalent ( see sub-group analysis ) . Secondary Exposures : A combination aspirin clopidogrel follow determine : CYP2C19 inhibit PPIs , non-CYP2C19 inhibiting PPIs , omeprazole , paroxetine fluoxetine . Paroxetine fluoxetine select CYP2C19 inhibitor likely widely use long periods time . Secondary Outcomes : Incident GI bleed , incident MI . Data Analysis : Data analyse use STATA v9.2 ( StataCorp , Texas ) use Cox regression adjust possible confounders ( see covariates ) . Rate ratio ( RR ) 95 % confidence interval estimate outcome outline , compare individual expose aspirin + clopidogrel + PPI people expose aspirin + clopidogrel + PPI . Follow time individual classify accord treatment receive point time . We use record data dose frequency pack size estimate exposure period prescription . Where data missing , median length exposure calculate prescription drug assume . Sub-group analysis : Since smoke important potential confounder record perfectly GPRD , sensitivity analysis undertake . The main imprecision likely among ex-smokers record non-smokers . We therefore undertake analysis include people record definite `` never smoker '' people record current smoker . Linkage MINAP GPRD available practice GPRD . All analysis use MINAP-validated date ACS event restrict patient practice linkage establish . Sample Size Power Calculation GPRD feasibility count indicate &gt; 40,000 patient may receive clopidogrel aspirin simultaneously 31,000 also receive PPI point . Assuming study period incidence primary outcome 25 % 1 conservative exposed/unexposed group size 5,000 , would &gt; 99 % power detect rate ratio 1.2 compare rate death MI among aspirin clopidogrel user take PPI take PPI . This would consistent effect detect study date ( Ho et al 2009 , Juurlink et al 2009 ) . Covariates MI , mortality GI bleed several well-established risk factor also likely associated exposure interest study . We therefore examine possible confound effect follow covariates . The list include covariates find associated PPI treatment observational study do area date : - Age , sex , general practice , smoke status , alcohol consumption , body mass index - History : - diabetes , MI , percutaneous coronary intervention , coronary artery bypass graft surgery , heart failure , cerebrovascular disease , cancer , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , renal disease , hepatic disease , dementia , GI bleed , peripheral vascular disease , atherosclerotic disease . It possible patient receive clopidogrel + aspirin PPI differ prescribe PPI extent comparison rate MI , mortality GI bleeds may invalid . To investigate possibility calculate propensity score PPI treatment use baseline characteristic . Only patient propensity score within common range 2 group include cohort analysis , ensure fair comparison . This study part CALIBER ( Cardiovascular disease research use link bespoke study electronic record ) programme fund 5 year NIHR Wellcome Trust . The central theme CALIBER research linkage Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project ( MINAP ) primary care ( GPRD ) , secondary care ( HES ) resource . The overarch aim CALIBER good understand aetiology prognosis specific coronary phenotype across range causal domain , particularly electronic record provide contribution beyond traditional study . CALIBER receive Ethics approval ( ref 09/H0810/16 ) ECC approval ( ref ECC 2-06 ( b ) /2009 CALIBER dataset )</detailed_description>
