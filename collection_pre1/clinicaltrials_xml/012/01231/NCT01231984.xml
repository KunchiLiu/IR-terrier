	<brief_summary>Anxiety needle concern commonly express diabetic begin insulin therapy . A shorter , thinner pen needle delivers insulin safety efficacy profile longer pen needle may appeal many diabetic patient shorter needle may perceive less intimidate comfortable . While pen needle 4 8 mm length generally use insulin injection patient consider thin normal weight , long ( 12.7 mm ) needle still often prescribed overweight obese patient diabetes . Since skin thickness nearly constant across range body mass index ( BMI ) , clear rationale exists use short needle obese patient . ( Gibney et al. , CMRO 2010 ) The primary purpose study evaluate whether BD Ultra-Fine™ Nano 4mm x 32 Gauge ( G ) pen needle manufactured Becton , Dickinson Company ( BD ) provide equivalent glucose control ( measure hemoglobin A1c level ) BD Ultra-Fine™ 8mm x 31G BD Ultra-Fine™ 12.7mm x 29G pen needle obese subject diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each subject 's participation expect last total 7 month include screen visit , three-week wash-in period ( one week three different size pen needle ) follow two consecutive 12 week study period . The purpose three week wash-in period minimize number dropout follow study period ensure subject experience use three study needle find generally acceptable use study . Only subject complete wash-in period confirm agreement continue participate randomize one two study arm . Subjects randomly assign use BD Ultra-Fine™ 4mm pen needle either BD Ultra-Fine™ 8mm pen needle BD Ultra-Fine™ 12.7mm pen needle . The randomization also specify two study pen needle use first . Half study subject use BD Ultra-Fine™ 4mm BD Ultra-Fine™ 8mm pen needle ( 4mm/8mm arm ) half use BD Ultra-Fine™ 4mm BD Ultra-Fine™ 12.7mm pen needle ( 4mm/12.7mm arm ) . At end first 12 week study period subject switch assign pen needle second final study period . Glycemic control ( base HbA1c concentration ) assess baseline end 12 week study period .</detailed_description>
