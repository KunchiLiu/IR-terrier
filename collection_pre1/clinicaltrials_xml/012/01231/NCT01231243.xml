	<brief_summary>There controversy dentistry literature use associate light activate 35 % hydrogen peroxide gel in-office tooth bleach may increase bleach effectiveness . The study demonstrate increased level bleach use light activation employ low hydrogen peroxide gel one report statistical difference employ high hydrogen peroxide gel . The hypothesis study effectiveness light activation tooth bleach dependent hydrogen peroxide concentration employ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Effectiveness In-office Bleaching Activated With LED/Laser Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study compare color change tooth sensitivity in-office bleach use different hydrogen peroxide concentration without light activation . Sixty patient enrolled trial divide equally 4 group accord combination main factor hydrogen peroxide concentration ( 35 % 20 % ) LED/laser activation ( yes ) . Three 15-min application perform clinical appointment . A LED/laser device use respective group three 1-min application interval 2 min . The procedure repeat one week later . The color change assess hte 1st 2nd session , 1 week 6 month end treatment use value-oriented shade Vita Classical spectrophotometer Easy Shade . The tooth sensitivity report patient use 0 10 visual analog scale . The Student test ( α = .05 ) use compare tooth color change intensity tooth sensitivity group baseline immediately first second bleaching appointment . The Fisher exact test Student test ( α = .05 ) , respectively , use analyze percentage patient tooth sensitivity intensity .</detailed_description>
