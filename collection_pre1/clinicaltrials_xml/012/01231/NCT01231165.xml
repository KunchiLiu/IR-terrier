A novel approach recently develop , base critical role potassium ( K ) content red-blood-cell myocardial oxygenation , since oxygen K bind hemoglobin ( red-blood-cell ) occur simultaneously blood passing lung , whereas organs heart , hemoglobin release Oxygen K ion . This apparently simple mechanism occur human blood individual could alter subject acquire hereditable defect red-blood-cell K content .

	<detailed_description>The Problem : Treatment Cardiovascular Diseases ( CVD ) major health care problem across entire word , particularly United States , Japan European Countries ( 1 ) . In fact , life-threatening disorder major cause emergency medical care hospitalization United States , accord National Center Health Statistics ( NCHS ) approximately 1,565,000 hospitalization primary secondary diagnosis acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) , 669,000 unstable angina ( UA ) 896,000 myocardial infarction ( MI ) . In 2003 , NCHS report 4,497,000 visit emergency department primary diagnosis CVD , wherein average age person first heart attack calculate 65.8 year men 70.4 year woman ( 2 ) Although treatment angina , chest pain secondary coronary heart disease ( stable chronic angina ) one common early symptom Coronary Heart Disease ( CHD ) track far 1880 's , still represent medically unresolved problem . Indeed , treatment angina particular , well associate condition ACS , UA , MI , involve large number life-style recommendation , dietetic advice , drug , coronary artery intervention , coronary bypass surgery aim improve symptom , quality life patient , even primary secondary prevention stable chronic angina . Unfortunately , despite century medical advance epidemiological study , current approach CVD coronary heart disease remain complex , time frustrate . Among proposal treat stable chronic angina new aspect consider , include single `` polypill '' agent ( aspirin + statin + 3 blood pressure lower agent half dose , folic acid ) , Simvastatin intravascular ultrasound study , intra-coronary angiogenesis therapy ( 3-5 ) . However , unpractical , whereas difficult determine whether change translate meaningful reduction clinical event , whether result highly select patient population match real-world prevention treatment coronary artery syndrome . Further , recent large clinical trial , COURAGE study ( 6 ) , conduct 50 hospital center United States Canada show optimal drug treatment percutaneous coronary intervention stable coronary heart disease , effective optimal medical therapy alone prevent cardiovascular event , hospitalization death , suggest drug , surgical procedure statistically effective solution stable chronic angina . By inference , therapeutic approach mot severe coronary syndrome UA , post- myocardial infarction angina , aggravate angina episode , seem distant goal . Physiological Basis Innovation : For century , extremely rapid couple tissue O2/CO2 gas exchange ion H/K transport Hemoglobin ( Hb ) red blood cell ( RBC ) well know scientific community , so-called Bohr/Haldane Effect ( 7 ) . Since , note confirm RBC critical role maintain normal vascular function , blood flow tissue oxygenation acid-base regulation . These functional role RBC include nitric oxide ( NO ) transport , NO synthetasa , regulation platelet aggregation , vascular rheology , endothelial function ( 8 ) . Indeed , recent study demonstrate erythrocyte serf regulator vascular tone tissue perfusion , whereas hemoglobin RBC may sensors oxygen tissue requirement ( 9 ) . In context , evidence erythrocyte major intravascular storage nitrite ( 10 ) , nitroglycerin effect erythrocyte rheology oxygen unload myocardial ischemia mediate S-Nitrosohemoglobin ( 11 ) implies RBC K exchange preserve subject CHD , especially hereditable defect RBC K transport exists ( 12 ) . Unfortunately , despite multiple integrated function maintain tissue oxygenation health disease state , role RBC never consider therapeutic approach stable chronic angina ( 13 ) . However , recent observation reversal abnormal low RBC K content hypertensive patient receive low dos pyrazinoylguanidine hydrochloride ( amiloride HCl , 5 mg ) , calcium gluconolactate associate well control BP , regression ST-T alteration related LVH coronary heart disease ( 14 ) , strongly support novel mechanistic approach improve blood flow myocardium oxygen transport stable chronic angina . Informed consent obtain patient , Review board committee Docent Institute Urology , University Carabobo Medical School , Valencia , approve trial . This trial continuation Protocol ID UIC-3 2007 ( Novel Treatment Coronary Artery Disease , NCT 01228214 ) also register ClinicalTrials.gov METHODS ( I ) Clinical Methods At inclusion period clinical visit subject measurement BP , HR , body weight/height measurement body resistance reactance Body Composition Analysis Total Body water extra-cellular space , Fat-Free-Mass , Fat Mass . Number anginal episode , functional anginal class ( CCS ) record case . ( II ) Laboratory Methods All patient routine measurement Ion Transport Studies , include 12-hour night ( 7 pm- 7 ) urine collection , follow fast state measurement plasma ( Na , K , Cl , Mg++ , Ionized calcium ) , RBC ( Na , K , H2O content ) , urine ( Na , K , Cl , Mg++ , calcium ) electrolytes , along plasma urine osmolality , entry , 4-week , 3 , 8 12-months period .
