	<detailed_description>ING111762 48 week , randomize , double-blind , active-controlled , multicenter , parallel group , non-inferiority study . The study conduct least 688 HIV-1 infected antiretroviral experience , integrase-naïve subject . Subjects randomize 1:1 receive GSK1349572 50 mg daily raltegravir ( RAL ) 400 mg twice daily , add investigator select background regimen consist least one fully active agent plus one second single agent may may active . Antiviral activity , safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , development viral resistance evaluate . Subjects must document genotypic phenotypic resistance least one member least two antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) drug class [ nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( N [ ] RTI ) , non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) , protease inhibitor ( PI ) , fusion inhibitor ( T20 ) , entry inhibitor ( chemokine receptor 5 [ CCR5 ] antagonist ) ] . The primary analysis take place last subject complete 48 week therapy . An additional data cut analysis conduct last subject complete 24 week therapy . Subjects randomize GSK1349572 successfully complete Week 48 continue receive GSK1349572 either locally available , longer derive clinical benefit , meet protocol-defined reason discontinuation , development compound terminate .

	<criteria>Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) experience , Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) 1 infected adult least 18 year age . Women capable become pregnant must use appropriate contraception study ( define protocol ) . HIV1 infection document HIV1 RNA &gt; 400 copies/mL ( c/mL ) Screening least one consecutive HIV1 RNA &gt; 400 c/mL within four month prior Screening ( unless Screening HIV1 RNA &gt; 1000 c/mL additional plasma HIV1 RNA assessment need ) . Have document resistance ( via Screening resistance test ) two different class antiretroviral agent . For subject ART least one month , Screening resistance result provide fully active agent show two class resistance historical resistance result subject 's recent resistance testing may use , follow consultation study virologist /or medical monitor . Integrase inhibitor ( INI ) naïve , define prior exposure INI ( e.g . RAL , elvitegravir , GSK1349572 ) . Able provide write informed consent prior Screening . French subject : In France , subject eligible inclusion study either affiliate beneficiary social security category . Screening resistance test result indicate fully active antiviral agent available design background regimen . Subjectvirus yield result use genotype/phenotype/tropism Screening ( assay data essential eligibility determination ) . Women breastfeed . Any evidence active AIDSdefining condition ( except cutaneous Kaposi 's sarcoma require systemic therapy CD4+ &lt; 200c/mm3 ) . Subjects moderate severe hepatic impairment define ChildPugh classification . Recent history ( less equal 3 month ) upper low gastrointestinal bleed , exception anal rectal bleeding . Anticipated need hepatitis C therapy study . History presence allergy intolerance study drug component drug class . History malignancy within past 5 year ongoing malignancy cutaneous Kaposi 's sarcoma , basal cell carcinoma , resect , noninvasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ; localize malignancy require agreement investigator study medical monitor inclusion subject . Treatment HIV1 immunotherapeutic vaccine within 90 day prior Screening . Treatment follow agent within 28 day Screening : radiation therapy , cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent , immunomodulator . Treatment agent , license ART , document activity HIV1 vitro within 28 day first dose investigational product . Exposure experimental drug and/or experimental vaccine within either 28 day , 5 halflives test agent , twice duration biological effect experimental test agent whichever longer , prior first dose IP . French subject recruit site France exclude subject participate study use investigational drug and/or vaccine within 60 day 5 halflives , twice duration biological effect experimental drug vaccine whichever longer prior screen study subject plan participate simultaneously another clinical study . Any acute verify Grade 4 laboratory abnormality . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) . ALT great equal 3xULN bilirubin great equal 1.5xULN ( &gt; 35 % direct bilirubin ) .</criteria>
