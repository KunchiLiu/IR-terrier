	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Everolimus may stop growth stomach esophageal cancer block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing , stop spread . Giving everolimus together combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose everolimus give together combination chemotherapy treat patient metastatic stomach esophageal cancer spread place body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Stomach Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose everolimus use combination mFOLFOX6 [ oxaliplatin , leucovorin ( leucovorin calcium ) , 5-FU ( fluorouracil ) ] . II . To good describe toxicity associate combination everolimus mFOLFOX6 . III . To assess response rate progression-free survival patient population . IV . To assess overall survival patient metastatic gastric , esophageal gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) adenocarcinoma treat combination mFOLFOX6 + everolimus . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study everolimus . Patients receive fluorouracil intravenously ( IV ) continuously 46 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 . Patients also receive oral everolimus daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 1 year .</detailed_description>
