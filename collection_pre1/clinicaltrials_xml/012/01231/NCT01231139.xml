	<brief_title>The Paracetamol AfteR Traumatic Brain InjurY Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic head injury bruise area brain occur commonly result fall motor vehicle accident . Unfortunately , common global occurrence occur develop developed country . It cause death nearly 1 3 severely affected large proportion survive long-term physical mental disability . Hence , traumatic head injury major global problem . At present therapy know effective traumatic head injury . In particular investigator uncertain whether modify body temperature effect ( good bad ) outcomes patient . Although , practice intensive care unit around world . The investigator search extensively look evidence alter body temperature traumatic head injury improve outcome patient ( reduce amount death disability ) unable find evidence . Some preliminary research animal experiment clinical study suggest raise temperature form brain injury may fact harmful . Therefore , present investigator believe really know effect change body temperature head injury outcome patient . The investigator propose conduct clinical study patient severe head injury . The patient randomly allocate 2 group get either regular Paracetamol ( dissolve fluid ) bottle fluid without Paracetamol . The 2 treatment look identical neither patient health care worker know treatment get . Doing study way allow u work whether give Paracetamol reduces temperature body whether side effect occur . If study show Paracetamol reduce body temperature safely set investigator work towards large study treatment reduce body temperature . The purpose large study would see investigator , reduce body temperature also reduce amount disability ( physical mental ) well death rate traumatically brain injured patient . In proposed study investigator use high dose Paracetamol usually prescribe . Other research show dose investigator propose use safe also small dos fact reduce body temperature .</detailed_description>
