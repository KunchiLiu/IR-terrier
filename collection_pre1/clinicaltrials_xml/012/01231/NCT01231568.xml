	<brief_title>An Open Label Study Examine Effects High-Fat Meal Particle Size Pharmacokinetics Orally Administered GSK2118436 Subjects With BRAF Mutation Positive Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GSK2118436 orally administer , potent selective small molecule BRAF inhibitor currently develop treatment BRAF mutation-positive tumor . This study design evaluate effect particle size relative bioavailability GSK2118436 ( Cohort 1 ) evaluate effect high-fat meal pharmacokinetics GSK2118436 ( Cohort 2 ) . Subjects randomly receive two four possible regimen two period . Subjects enrol Cohort 1 receive single 150 mg dose GSK2118436 micronized particle fast ( gelatin capsule formulation ) single 150 mg dose GSK2118436 non-micronized particle fast ( large particle size ) . Subjects enrol Cohort 2 receive single 150 mg dose GSK2118436 ( HydroxyPropyl Methyl Cellulose ( HPMC ) capsule formulation ) fast high-fat breakfast . GSK2118436 administer mesylate salt ( equivalent 150 mg free base ) . Safety tolerability also evaluate . The study conduct sufficient number center complete approximately 28 adult subject ( 14 subject per cohort ) BRAF mutation-positive tumor . Following completion study , subject may continue dose GSK2118436 roll-over study , Protocol BRF114144 .</detailed_description>
