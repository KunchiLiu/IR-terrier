	<brief_summary>GSK1349572 integrase inhibitor currently clinical development treatment human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . GSK1349572 metabolize primarily uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase ( UGT ) 1A1 minor role Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A . Hepatic impairment could potentially alter clearance plasma protein bind GSK1349572 . This study evaluate single dose pharmacokinetics safety GSK1349572 healthy subject subject mild moderate hepatic impairment base Child-Pugh category . This single-dose , open-label , parallel group , two-part , adaptive study adult male females mild moderate hepatic impairment match , healthy control subject normal hepatic function . Healthy control subject ( 16 ) match gender , age , BMI subject mild ( 8 ) moderate ( 8 ) hepatic impairment category . In Part 1 , approximately 8 subject moderate hepatic impairment ( cohort 1 ) 8 match , control subject ( cohort 2 ) receive GSK1349572 50 mg single dose fast state follow pharmacokinetic sampling total concentration GSK1349572 plasma . Free ( unbound ) plasma concentration GSK1349572 also evaluate sparse , select time point . If geometric mean total plasma area concentration curve ( AUC ) GSK1349572 increase &gt; 2-fold moderately impaired subject compare matched control , Part 2 conduct evaluate GSK1349572 pharmacokinetics another group subject mild impairment ( 8 , cohort 3 ) match , control subject ( 8 , cohort 4 ) . Vital sign , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , adverse event monitor throughout study . A follow-up visit occur 7-10 day dose study drug .</brief_summary>
