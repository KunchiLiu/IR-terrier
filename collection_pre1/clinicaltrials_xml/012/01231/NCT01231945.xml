	<brief_summary>Background : - Low-cost molecular human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing may offer robust alternative Pap smear visual inspection cervical cancer screen underserved woman . Two low-cost molecular test human HPV , HPV E6 Test careHPV test , develop detect cervical cancer test HPV DNA . These test take 2 3 hour run may provide point-of-care ( diagnostic testing near site patient care ) test HPV . Researchers interested evaluating test determine best strategy HPV test woman live rural underserved area high prevalence cervical cancer diagnosis . Objectives : - To evaluate clinical performance HPV E6 Test careHPV detect cervical cancer precancerous lesion . - To evaluate best low-cost test combination test woman refer cervical cancer screen treatment . - To compare clinical performance self-collected specimen versus clinician-collected specimen detect cervical cancer precancerous lesion . Eligibility : - Women 25 65 year age live rural China . Design : - This study involve initial test visit 1-year followup visit high-risk subgroup . - Participants HPV E6 test , careHPV , visual inspection test cervical cancer . For comparison , participant also standard HPV test approve U.S. Food Drug Administration . - Participants test positive HPV test also colposcopy collect sample cervical tissue study . - A random sample woman test negative HPV also colposcopy . Participants may also biopsies visual evidence cervical abnormality . - At 1-year followup visit , participant high-risk subgroup test previous visit..</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Low-cost , molecular human papillomavirus ( HPV ) testing may offer robust alternative Pap smear visual inspection acetic acid ( VIA ) cervical cancer screen underserved woman . Two low-cost molecular test human papillomavirus ( HPV ) develop : 1 ) AVantage HPV E6 Test ( Arbor Vita Corporation , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) ( HPV E6 Test ) detect E6 oncoproteins HPV16 , 18 , 45 2 ) careHPV ( Qiagen , Gaithersburg , MD , USA ) detect DNA pool 14 carcinogenic HPV genotype . The HPV E6 Test ready first clinical evaluation 2010 . The HPV E6 Test work like ELISA strip format take less two hour run may provide point-of-care ( diagnostic testing near site patient care ) testing . careHPV , batch HPV DNA test take 2.5 hour perform , already develop currently use demonstration project . The result date careHPV promising . As primary objective , wish evaluate test , evaluate best low-cost triage strategy careHPV-positive result area high prevalence carcinogenic HPV DNA . A study 7,500 woman , age 25-65 year , identify age- region-stratified sample woman live rural China conduct . All woman screen enrollment , high-risk subgroup one-year follow-up , follow test : HPV E6 Test , careHPV , visual inspection acetic acid ( VIA ) . Women also screen enrollment , high-risk subgroup one-year follow-up , use digene HC2 HPV DNA Test TM ( HC2 ) ( formerly know Hybrid Capture 2 ) ( Qiagen ) , first U.S. Food Drug Administration-approved HPV test gold standard clinical HPV testing . At time point , screen-positive woman evaluate colposcopy use rigorous diagnostic protocol . A random sample screen negative undergo colposcopy undergo biopsy visual evidence cervical epithelial abnormality . careHPV-positive specimen test carcinogenic HPV genotype , HPV16 , HPV18 , HPV45 use careHPV16/18/45 . This triage test utilizes test platform careHPV screen 3 carcinogenic HPV genotype . The primary goal 1 ) evaluate clinical performance careHPV , HPV E6 Test , VIA detection cervical precancer cancer 2 ) determine positive predictive value VIA , HPV E6 Test , HPV16/18/45 detection careHPV16/18/45 cervical precancer cancer among careHPV-positive woman .</detailed_description>
