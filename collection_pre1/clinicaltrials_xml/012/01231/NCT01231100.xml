	<brief_title>Hand-carried Ultrasound Echocardiography Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This unblinded , parallel-group , superiority trial randomize participant balance ( 1:1 ) allocation ratio . We make change protocol begin enrollment . Nor conduct interim analysis . Each morning study period , include weekend holiday , investigator list consecutive patient newly refer SE participate hospitalists . After hospitalists complete initial evaluation patient , include history , physical exam , review medical record , investigator ask choose indication SE close list . Given indication , investigator ask HCUE could help assess patient ; , investigator exclude patient . Finally , hospitalists ask current management plan , include medication regimen , diagnostic test , specialty consultation , time hospital discharge . If hospitalists remain masked preliminary SE result , investigator assign participant give write informed consent intervention group . We use computer-generated list random number allocation sequence , conceal sequence on-site computer system release allocation investigator enter participant identifier . Hospitalists either await SE result participant randomize usual care perform HCUE participant randomize HCUE-guided care . Hospitalists perform HCUE MicroMaxx 3.4 hand-carried ultrasound machine equip cardiology software package 1 5 MHz P17 cardiac transducer ( Sonosite , Inc. , Bothell , WA ) . The detail HCUE protocol describe elsewhere . In brief , without assistance nursing staff , hospitalists position participant standard hospital bed record 7 best-quality image 6 second duration . Then hospitalists replayed image immediate interpretation . They make linear measurement caliper hold directly ultrasound monitor translate qualitative assessment base simplified standard value . The primary outcome length stay short stay unit general medicine ward service refer hospitalist . The duration begin patient admitted hospitalist service end patient discharge home transfer different service hospital . We choose duration , rather length stay entire hospitalization , want primary outcome reflect HCUE affect hospitalists ' management decision hospital , include transfer participant service .</detailed_description>
