	<brief_summary>MicroRNAs ( MiRNAs ) regulate translation RNAs implicate cell proliferation renewal physiologically normal well malignant condition . Dysregulation specific miRNAs may associate either gain oncogenic loose tumor suppress function . MiRNA dysregulation implicate breast cancer tumorigenic ( stem cell ) non-tumorigenic development . Therefore , miRNA profile treatment na√Øve treatment-exposed breast tumor sequential sample blood/serum allow identification miRNA marker prognosis indicator potential target personalize therapy . In proposal , specimens patient treat clinical breast cancer program already exist protocol ( IRB 05091 05015 ) characterize Dr. Rossi 's laboratory collaborator , information gain apply develop specific therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MIRNA Profiling Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Neoadjuvant Adjuvant Treatment Locally Advanced &amp; Inflammatory Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current neoadjuvant adjuvant treatment strategy allow rationale incorporation agent . One need tools predict de novo acquire resistance therapeutic agent . This difficult task , due compound nature escape route : tumor exposure usually combination therapeutic agent mechanisms resistance broad : intrinsic resistance due exist mutation , regulatory - miRNA , epigenetic - alteration , polymorphism , tumor cell adaptation via new mutation activation alternative pathway , lack optimal pharmacokinetics/genomics , activation efflux mechanism , accelerate repair mechanism involve . Similarly , patient candidate primary surgical intervention follow post-operative adjuvant therapy benefit systemic treatment . The mechanisms resistance de novo survive stem cell/tumorigenic component , acquire cell leave behind `` dormant '' surgical intervention , well delineate . Breast tumor subject neoadjuvant chemotherapy allow baseline treatment-effected sampling . Characterization core biopsy specimens primary tumor procure prior exposure neoadjuvant therapy different variety breast cancer subtypes , subsequent mid-treatment intraoperative ( procured definitive surgery follow completion neoadjuvant therapy ) sample help assess predictive value pre-treatment post-treatment miRNA expression profile complete near complete response , surrogate marker survival . Similarly , pattern de novo acquire resistance may emerge assessment pre- post treatment miRNA expression profile analyze supervised manner classification use pathological response classifier . Samples obtain patient primary surgical removal tumor systemic treatment exposure hand , allow determine marker prognosis , predictor response therapeutic targeting agent .
