	<brief_title>Acute Osteoarthritis Experimental Model Study .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study include interim analysis approximately 50 patient randomise . Up 100 patient painful Osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee may recruit study . Eligible subject wash treatment OA pain minimum 7 day apart protocol rescue medication ( paracetamol ) . Following , subject participate three short term treatment period repeat administration Naproxen ( 500 mg/twice daily ) placebo 3 day . Between treatment period subject receive placebo . Endpoints include objective assessment function ( time walk stair climb ) subjective assessment pain include current pain , Western Ontario McMaster Universities Arthritis Index ( WOMAC ) Patient Global Impression Change . Throughout study subject ask rate pain periodically . Subjects attend unit Day 1 dispense study medication take first dose unit . They return unit Days 8 , 10 , 15 , 17 , 22 24 pain assessment , medication dispense visit , exclude Day 24 .</detailed_description>
