	<brief_summary>GSK1120212 potent highly selective inhibitor MEK phosphorylation kinase activity demonstrate potent anti-proliferative activity human pancreatic cancer cell line . This study Phase II , randomize placebo-controlled trial MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 plus gemcitabine vs. placebo plus gemcitabine subject metastatic pancreatic cancer . Eligible subject receive intravenous gemcitabine oral GSK1120212 placebo . Therapy continue treatment discontinuation criterion meet . The primary objective compare overall survival subject GSK1120212 plus gemcitabine arm vs. subject placebo plus gemcitabine arm . Secondary objective include comparison progression free survival , overall response rate , duration response two arm . Exploratory research objective include evaluation population pharmacokinetics well blood tissue base biomarkers . Safety also monitor throughout dose . Once determined number survival event occur , subject eligible , option enter MEK114375 , open-label , Phase Ib rollover study GSK1120212 monotherapy GSK1120212 combination anti-cancer treatment .</brief_summary>
