	<brief_summary>Background : - Fatigue , common side effect cancer treatment , find 96 % cancer patient . Fatigue difficult treat cause poorly understood . Research indicate cancer-related fatigue may cause number factor , include immune system responses cancer treatment . Researchers interested study individual receive cancer treatment order well understand cause fatigue . Objectives : - To study fatigue individual receive cancer treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age localize cancer spread schedule start cancer treatment National Institutes Health . Design : - This study involve initial screen visit minimum three outpatient visit . - Participants screen medical history , blood test . - Participants schedule cycle cancer treatment see start cycle , midpoint cycle , end cycle . Participants whose treatment follow cycle see start treatment ; 2 week start treatment ; 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year start treatment , total six outpatient visit . - At study visit , participant complete follow task : - Questionnaires physical activity , fatigue , depression , quality life . - Computerized cognitive test memory , attention , ability follow direction . The test time determine whether brain function affect cancer treatment whether occur fatigue symptom . - Blood sample monitor immune system responses treatment . - Hand grip strength test evaluate physical strength . - Physical activity monitor journal study fatigue affect physical activity . - Participants need additional cycle cancer treatment continue visit end third cycle , maximum nine outpatient visit . - Treatment provide study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although underlying mechanism fatigue study several disease condition , etiology , mechanism , risk factor remain elusive , symptom remain poorly manage present . Longitudinal study relate treatment-related fatigue cancer patient conduct , limited data show change molecular mechanism cancer therapy identify individual risk experience fatigue therapy . Fatigue conceptualize multidimensional symptom incorporate temporal , sensory , cognitive/mental , affective/emotional , behavioral , physiological dimension . This prospective , observational study explore molecular-genetic mechanism underlie fatigue experience cancer patient receive various therapy ( e.g . immune therapy , hormone therapy , chemotherapy ) . The primary objective study describe change self-reported fatigue , depression , health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) experience cancer patient , , cancer therapy . The secondary objective study investigate pro-inflammatory cytokine profile ( TNFalpha , IGF-I , IL-6 , IL-8 , TGFalpha beta ) , determine change gene expression peripheral blood tissue sample , , cancer treatment relate change level biological marker self-reported fatigue , depression , HRQOL score . This study also aim measure skeletal muscle strength , cognitive function , activity level energy expenditure patient , , completion cancer treatment relate finding self-reported fatigue , depression , HRQOL score .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Clinically localize metastatic cancer determine diagnostic test cytology imaging ( , limit nonmetastatic head neck cancer , lung cancer , breast cancer , renal cancer ) Scheduled receive primary cancer treatment salvage therapy ( e.g . hormone therapy , chemotherapy plus glucocorticosteroids , immunotherapy combination cancer treatment ) , type/s treatment anticipated change course study Able provide write informed consent Women men great equal to18 year age . Fluent one languages list Appendix 2 protocol . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Progressive unstable disease cancer body system cause clinically significant fatigue ( e.g . class IV congestive heart failure , endstage renal disease , stage IV chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) include patient systemic infection ( e.g. , human immunodeficiency virus [ HIV ] , active hepatitis ) ; document recent ( &lt; 5 year ) history major depression , bipolar disease , psychosis , alcohol/drug dependence/abuse ; uncorrected hypothyroidism , untreated anemia ; chronic inflammatory disease ( e.g . rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus ) . Patients regularly take antipsychotic , anticonvulsant , since medication cause significant fatigue</criteria>
