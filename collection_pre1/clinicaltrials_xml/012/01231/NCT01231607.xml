	<brief_title>Dutasteride Versus Placebo Finasteride Men With Androgenetic Alopecia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Androgenetic alopecia common , androgen-induced , pattern progressive loss scalp hair onset age puberty genetically predisposed people . The influence androgens scalp hair growth mediate local systemic conversion testosterone dihydrotestosterone , enzyme 5 alpha-reductase . 5 alpha-reductase show exist 2 isoenzyme form , Type 1 Type 2 . Type 1 predominantly locate skin , hair follicle sebaceous gland , also find liver kidney . Type 2 dominant form male genitalia , include prostate , although also report present inner root sheath hair follicle . The presence isoenzymes hair follicle suggest form likely important pathogenesis treatment androgenetic alopecia . Inhibition Type 1 Type 2 5 alpha-reductase may expect effectively reduce systemic local dihydrotestosterone level inhibition either isoenzyme alone . Finasteride selective Type 2 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor currently approve oral treatment androgenetic alopecia worldwide . Dutasteride inhibit Type 1 Type 2 5alpha-reductase approve 80 country treatment benign prostatic hyperplasia , Korea treatment hair loss . Dutasteride approximately 3 time potent finasteride inhibit Type 2 5 alpha-reductase 100 time potent inhibit Type 1 5 alpha-reductase . In Phase II double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical study ( ARIA2004 ) conduct United States , dutasteride demonstrate significant increase target area hair count , compare placebo , early 12 week . In Phase III double- blind , placebo-controlled clinical study conduct Korea , dutasteride 0.5 milligram ( mg ) demonstrate significant increase target area hair count , compare placebo , 24 week . This 6 month study conduct provide additional evidence efficacy safety three dos dutasteride ( 0.02 , 0.1 0.5mg ) treatment androgenetic alopecia , specifically , characterize dose-response relationship ethnically-diverse population . Treatment arm equally balance approximately 180 per arm .</detailed_description>
