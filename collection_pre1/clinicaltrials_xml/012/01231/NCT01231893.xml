	<detailed_description>The increase number patient ( mostly young ) , sustain spinal cord injury mainly result motor vehicle accident , fall violence become worldwide serious clinical , social economical problem . Most accepted treatment protocol spinal cord injury focus technique early neuro-protection aim maximal prevention secondary spinal cord injury ( administration methylprednisolon spinal cord surgical decompression ) well method stimulation plasticity central nervous system ( neurorehabilitation ) . While method show stimulate functional recovery patient incomplete spinal cord injury , result treatment patient severe incomplete complete spinal cord injury remain unsatisfactory . This due lack spontaneous regeneration lesioned axon spinal cord . Results substantial number animal experiment perform mainly model mammalian spinal cord injury last 3 decade lead establishment numerous regeneration-promoting strategy include application neurotrophic factor , antibody block myelin-associated protein transplantation cell neurotrophic activity . Olfactory ensheathing cell ( OECs ) unique population macroglia find lamina propria olfactory mucosa , around olfactory nerve fascicle two out layer olfactory bulb . These cell natural ability stimulate regrowth lesioned peripheral central axon . In Phase I non-randomized control prospective study test hypothesis combine approach treatment complete spinal cord injury consist intraspinal transplantation mixture autologous OECs fibroblast isolate olfactory mucosa , combine intense neuro-rehabilitation safe feasible .</detailed_description>
