	<brief_summary>The project improve scientific knowledge regard recent law apply potentially every french driver . It give first time indication impact alert treatment drive risk . It reinforce link different research environment ( sleep physiopathology , clinical research , cognitive neuroscience , driver supervision , virtual reality , pharmacology ) among `` RÃ©seau Eveil Sommeil Attention et Transports '' ( RESAT ) network .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Method Assessment Driving Ability Patients Suffering From Wakefulness Pathologies .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Excessive daytime sleepiness responsible 20 % traffic accidents 2/3 truck accident French Freeways . Since publication new law ( 2005 december 28th - Official Journal ) regulate fitness drive , Maintenance Wakefulness Test ( MWT ) mandatory evaluate driving skill patient suffer excessive daytime sleepiness . The MWT show good predictability drive handicap simulator patient suffer obstructive sleep apnea syndrome . Nevertheless study proven yet predictability MWT regard real simulated driving patient suffer hepatic encephalopathy . Furthermore , even therapeutic drug significantly improve MWT score data available concern impact drug fitness drive . Lactulose , treatment hepatic encephalopathy , test counter measure drive impairment . This lack knowledge major handicap evaluate driving skill treat patient suffer excessive daytime sleepiness . The main objective project test predictive value MWT real simulate drive performance untreated treated sleepy patient suffer hepatic encephalopathy .</detailed_description>
