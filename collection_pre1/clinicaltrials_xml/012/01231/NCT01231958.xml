	<detailed_description>Puerto Rican adult live mainland US document health disparity ; however , little research conduct second large Hispanic subgroup . Our long-term goal understand complex interaction diet behavioral environmental factor , genetics , psychosocial stress high apparently increase prevalence cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor Puerto Rican adult . As group rapidly grow , understand reason risk great importance . Our initial funding period Boston Puerto Rican Center Population Health Health Disparities ( BPR-CPHHD , 2003-08 ) focus role stress physical disability cognitive decline , physiological dysregulation `` allostatic load . '' During investigation , become clear risk factor CVD highly prevalent . These finding contrast commonly hold belief Hispanic paradox -- low heart disease mortality despite great poverty . Importantly , Puerto Rican population differs considerably ancestral genetic history exposure know risk factor Hispanic group . They unique dietary intake pattern , well social , cultural environmental structure contribute affect reaction stressor . During initial funding period , successfully assemble cohort 1500 Puerto Rican adult , age 45-75 year baseline , complete two-year follow-up interview 1250 participant . As population age grow rapidly , high prevalence apparent cohort effect increase heart disease risk factor suggest 1 ) population serious health disparity heart disease risk factor 2 ) heart disease become even great problem group near future . Our overall aim renewal , therefore , extend follow-up measure analyze relevant characteristic CVD risk factor , add additional contextual outcome measure CVD risk establish cohort Puerto Rican adult , may better understand dynamic disparity . Our model follow transdisciplinary `` cell society '' concept develop jointly partner CPHHDs initial funding period , consideration genetic variation relation longitudinal change allostatic load biochemical indicator risk ; additional focus social network , neighborhood characteristic ( physical space access food ) environment ( air pollution ) factor social determinant health . Finally , use community base participatory technique , implement test multidimensional intervention focus diet exercise , also fully consider social physical environment ensure success . With participation community partner , support administrative , biostatistics laboratory core , team efficiently poise make significant contribution understand factor contribute apparent grow threat heart disease highly disadvantage groupâ€”while provide insight may useful vulnerable group . The continuation cohort , rich constellation measure , allow u unravel complex etiologic interaction contribute CVD risk , effective intervention may implement . To date , complete approximately 840 5-year follow-up interview .</detailed_description>
