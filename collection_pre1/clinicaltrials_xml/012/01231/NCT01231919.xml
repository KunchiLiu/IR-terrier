	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : l. To estimate maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend phase 2 dose MK-2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK2206 ) administer orally every day ( schedule 1 ) weekly ( schedule 2 ) child refractory recurrent solid malignancy , include central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor lymphomas . II . To define describe toxicity MK-2206 child refractory solid malignancy administer schedule . III . To assess tolerability MK-2206 solid tumor MTD patient recurrent refractory leukemia . IV . To characterize pharmacokinetics MK-2206 child recurrent refractory cancer . ( exploratory ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity MK-2206 within confines phase 1 study . ( exploratory ) II . To evaluate biological activity MK-2206 measuring phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( PI3K ) /protein kinase B ( AKT ) /mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) signal tumor peripheral blood mononuclear cell measure expression biomarkers related AKT activation phenotype . ( exploratory ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ( part A ) follow treatment maximum-tolerated dose ( part B ) . Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) every day ( schedule 1 ) OR weekly ( schedule 2 ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course ( 1 year ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
