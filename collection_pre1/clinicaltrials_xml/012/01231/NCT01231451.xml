	<brief_summary>DMPA ( depot medroxyprogesterone acetate 'depot ' injection ) widely use contraception . It popular woman HIV probably still work take HIV drug . HIV drug increase decrease level drug ( e.g . contraceptive ) bloodstream may make work less well increase side effect . It assume DMPA give HIV drug study prove . The purpose study investigate whether HIV drug combination contain lopinavir/ritonavir affect DMPA take time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Depot Contraception With Without Lopinavir/Ritonavir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) license use combination antiretrovirals treatment HIV infection . Like agent protease inhibitor class , LPV/r inhibit 3A isoenzyme hepatic cytochrome P450 system may increase level drug metabolise via route . However , LPV/r also show vivo induce metabolism increase biotransformation drug metabolize P450 enzyme glucuronidation . Women account increase proportion HIV epidemic UK . The huge reduction HIV-related mortality morbidity associate use effective combination antiretroviral therapy lead shift focus longer term issue , include reproductive health contraception . The impact variety antiretrovirals plasma pharmacokinetics oral oestrogen progesterone preparation investigate general NNRTIs boost PIs cause reduction level , particularly oral oestrogen preparation . Most package insert combine ( oestrogen progestogen ) progestogen-only oral contraceptive recommend additional contraceptive method employ concomitant use enzyme-inducing agent . Injectable contraception provide highly effective contraception without need daily pill take , important factor consider individual already take regular medication . Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate ( DMPA ) frequently prescribe injectable method . DMPA , like progestogen , metabolise cytochrome P450 system interaction study woman antiretrovirals limit . A study 59 woman DMPA contraception plus unboosted PI ( nelfinavir ) NNRTI ( efavirenz nevirapine ) measure DMPA level compare 16 woman either therapy NRTIs ( potential drug interaction ) . DMPA level similar group suppression ovulation 12 week period also similar group . Although high level DMPA achieve dose interval make pharmacokinetic interaction unlikely clinically significant , clinician advise reduction interval DMPA injection 12 10 week patient NNRTI boost PI ; clear evidence support approach . Although described study support normal dose interval woman NNRTI , unboosted PI nelfinavir recommend standard care impact ritonavir-boosted PIs unclear . The summary product characteristic DMPA advise normal dose interval even use potent enzyme inducer , suggest additional intervention require prescribing boost PI . Formal pharmacokinetic data crucial clarify important area .</detailed_description>
