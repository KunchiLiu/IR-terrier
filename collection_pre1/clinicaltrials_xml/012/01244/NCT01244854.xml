	<detailed_description>Background : Persons serious mental illness ( SMI , include schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , chronic affective disorder ) experience disproportionate burden medical comorbidity , notably cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , lead poor functioning premature mortality . CVD risk factor person SMI attributable unhealthy lifestyle exacerbate mental health-related symptom , medication side effect ( e.g. , weight gain ) , fragmentation physical mental health service . Objectives : The specific aim rapid response proposal pilot study 1 ) adopt test feasibility evidence-based psychosocial intervention ( Life Goals Collaborative Care- LGCC ) design promote health behavioral change develop bipolar disorder broad SMI patient population , 2 ) describe implementation LGCC barrier facilitator adoption generalizable SMI patient population , vet program key VA stakeholder order inform large implementation study across different VHA setting . Methods : LGCC novel manual-based intervention incorporate behavioral change strategy within Chronic Care Model-based program . It design reduce risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , improve control psychiatric symptom increase positive health behavior , well improve coordination physical mental health care . We enroll 100 individual diagnose chronic mental disorder CVD risk factor also receive care within VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System mental health clinic , 50 randomize LGCC , 50 randomize receive usual care . LGCC consist 1 ) 10 session focus CVD risk reduction behavioral change within context patient ' psychiatric symptom ; 2 ) participant goal set diet exercise ; 3 ) customize ongoing motivational interviewing ( MI ) -based patient contact health specialist 6 month , addition 4 ) strategy increase provider access support behavioral change medical management . Outcomes assess determine whether effect size comparable previously publish LGCC randomize control trial , include mental physical health-related quality life long-term ( 10-year ) CVD risk base Framingham risk score assess 6 month . Additional mixed method analysis administrator , consumer provider interview inform adoption LGCC also complete . Impact : Serious mental illness associate significant disability , decrease quality life , decreased life span . VA patient SMI die average 13-18 year earlier age gender match individual U.S. population , mostly CVD . Interventions LGCC combine individualize lifestyle coaching Chronic Care Model principle may lead great impact public health crisis address multiple reason health disparity , behavior change reinforce improved coordination continuity care . If effective , LGCC could easily disseminate VA practice align emerge VHA `` T-21 '' initiatives around veteran-centered care ( patient-centered medical home ) behavioral medicine program ultimately improve outcome veteran mental disorder .</detailed_description>
