	<detailed_description>Although pediatric central nervous system tumor rare , significant contributor morbidity mortality child . Tumor staging , detect recurrent tumor , assess response therapy critical treatment brain tumor , current image method major limitation provide information . The objective study validate 3'-deoxy-3'- [ F-18 ] fluorothymidine ( 18F-FLT ) measure tumor proliferation demonstrate utility 18F-FLT PET imaging agent child central nervous system tumor . The proposed study evaluate 18F-FLT PET three group : 1 . Children new diagnosis central nervous system tumor . 2 . Children conventional imaging raise concern possible recurrence central nervous system tumor . 3 . Children receive post-operative chemotherapy central nervous system tumor . In three group , correlation 18F-FLT uptake tumor histopathology patient outcome use assess utility 18F-FLT grading tumor diagnosis , accurate identification tumor recurrence , early assessment response chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
