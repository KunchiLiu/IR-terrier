	<brief_title>Addition Rituximab Leflunomide Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rituximab provide lasting improvement sign symptom rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) two infusion per treatment course tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) inhibitor inadequate responder ( IR ) patient . Importantly , MabThera® show inhibit radiographic progression highly pre-treated patient population . Rituximab license adult patient severe active RA combination methotrexate inadequate response previous treatment , include TNF alpha- Inhibitors . In daily practice combination methotrexate often limited side effect contraindication Methotrexate ( MTX ) . Therefore unmet medical need evidence combination RTX Disease modify anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) MTX . Leflunomide DMARD selectively inhibit de novo pyrimidine synthesis block enzyme dihydro-orotate dehydrogenase , thereby prevent DNA synthesis . The efficacy safety leflunomide patient active RA demonstrate three phase III study . Leflunomide show well placebo least effective methotrexate improve individual sign symptom RA ; response see early 4 week maintain 2 year . Leflunomide also effective slow disease progression assess radiographic analysis joint damage , improve functional activity measure Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disease Activity Index . An open label extension study patient treat leflunomide demonstrated improvement maintain 5 year subset patient , new unexpected adverse event emerge compare initial phase III study . In Europe leflunomide often use daily clinical practice alterative MTX patient active RA . Recently publish data small open label trial ( Vital et al . 2008 ) data German non-interventional study ( NIS ) ( Wendler et al . 2009 ) demonstrate effectiveness addition RTX leflunomide patient active RA . The proportion patient achieve EULAR ( European League Rheumatism ) moderate good response 61 % RTX alone , 65 % RTX plus MTX 79 % RTX plus leflunomide German NIS . In Leeds study Vital et al . 33 % patient achieve ACR ( American College Rheumatology ) 50 response ( ACR 20 : 68 % , ACR 70 : 20 % ) despite multiple pre-treatments , include patient inadequate response three TNF-Inhibitors . The low rate serious adverse drug reaction different group German NIS demonstrate safety combination RTX leflunomide ( n=90 ) ( 1.6 / 1.1 / 0,5 % RTX+MTX / RTX+LEF / RTX Mono , 5.1 / 6,7 / 3,8 % experienced infusion reaction )</detailed_description>
