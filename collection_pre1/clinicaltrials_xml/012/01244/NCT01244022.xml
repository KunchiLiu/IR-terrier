	<detailed_description>Every surgical intervention represent stress patient 's organism . During operation , numerous change patient 's metabolism take place , term surgical stress response . Leading cause surgical stress response tissue destruction always accompany operation . Surgical stress response effect activation hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis sympathetic activation . The consequence surgical stress response numerous . Surgical stress response essential uneventful postoperative recovery . On hand , excessive surgical stress response may lead serious postoperative complication , heart kidney failure , venous thrombosis , disruption operative wound wound infection . In prior study investigator show kinetics postoperative serum interleukin change radical resection gastric cancer . This study aim determine reliable marker surgical stress response severity patient undergoing radical resection colorectal cancer .</detailed_description>
