	<brief_summary>Neural Tube Defects ( NTDs ) multifactorial ( genetic/environmental ) diseases arise failure embryonic neural tube closure . Several study demonstrate periconceptional administration folic acid prevent approximately 70 % NTDs case . The finding several NTDs case single family , despite prophylactic therapy folic acid , suggest proportion human NTDs folate-resistant . So far , preventive therapy folate-resistant NTDs available . Studies perform folate-resistant NTDs animal model show inositol effective prevent NTDs occurrence . Preliminary result patient least two previous pregnancy affect NTDs , despite folic acid supplementation , indicate periconceptional treatment 500 mg/day inositol ( three month conception two month ) able prevent NTDs recurrence human . Recently , caffeine intake ( 10 mg/day ) associate increase risk NTDs , especially subgroups people carry genetic variant enzymes involved caffeine metabolism . The teratogenic effect caffeine know since 70 . Indeed , gynecologist suggest pregnant woman avoid/reduce caffeine intake . It still unknown , however , whether pre-conception caffeine intake interfere prophylactic therapy NTDs . In proposed study , aim evaluate effect `` espresso '' consumption ( correspond 100 mg caffeine ) pharmacokinetics oral administer myo-inositol ( MI ) , order highlight possible negative effect caffeine MI adsorption excretion conception . The study consist two phase carry twelve healthy volunteer . During phase 1 , volunteer keep 15 day inositol-poor diet ; end period , 20 g MI administrate single dose . Basal level serum urinary concentration evaluate MI administration ( t0 ) ; subsequently , sample perform 2 , 4 , 6 8 hour MI administration . Phase 2 consist 15 additional day inositol-poor diet : basal level MI measure MI administration . In phase 2 , MI administration concomitant caffeine exposure single '' espresso '' consumption . Samples collect time point phase 1 .</brief_summary>
