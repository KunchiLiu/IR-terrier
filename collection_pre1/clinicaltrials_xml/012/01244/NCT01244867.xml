	<detailed_description>An adaptive design propose phase 2 trial . Part A study consist dose-ranging 135 subject randomize receive one injection either 20 µg , 30 µg 45 µg H5 VLP Influenza vaccine combine Alhydrogel® , 45 µg without Alhydrogel® , placebo preparation , ( 100mM phosphate buffer + 150mM NaCl + 0.01 % Tween 80 ) Days 0 21 . Seven-day ( 7 ) safety data first immunization subject five treatment group tabulate reviewed panel consist 2 external medical advisor , prior permit second immunization vaccine/placebo treatment group Day 21 ( Part A ) . Twenty-one ( 21 ) day last subject vaccine administration Part A , safety immunogenicity data collect analysed determine optimal dose level . Following selection optimal dose , Part B trial commence consist administration select optimal dose ( ) one hundred ( 100 ) subject , plus administration placebo twenty ( 20 ) subject ( total 120 subject part B ) . These subject similarly receive two vaccination 21 day apart follow exact fashion Part A , except 7-day safety analysis . Depending data analysis one maximum two vaccine dos could select evaluated part B trial . All Part A B subject follow safety Day 228 .</detailed_description>

Presence significant acute chronic , uncontrolled medical neuropsychiatric illness . `` Uncontrolled '' define : 1 . Requiring new medical surgical treatment within one month prior study vaccine administration ; 2 . Requiring change medication dosage one month prior test article administration due uncontrolled symptom drug toxicity ( elective dosage adjustment stable subject acceptable ) , 3 . Hospitalization event fulfil definition serious adverse event within one month prior test article administration ; Any medical neuropsychiatric condition , Investigator 's opinion , would render subject incompetent provide inform consent unable provide valid safety observation report ; Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive condition immunodeficiency include history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection Hepatitis B C presence lymphoproliferative disease ; Presence febrile illness , oral temperature &gt; 38.0˚C within 24 hour test article administration . Such subject may reevaluate enrolment resolution illness ; History autoimmune disease ; Administration vaccine ( include influenza vaccine ) within 30 day period prior study enrolment , plan administration within period first vaccination blood sample Day 42 within 30 day prior blood sample Day 228 .
