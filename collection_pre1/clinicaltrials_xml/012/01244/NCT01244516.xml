	<criteria>Be le 18 39 year age . Sign Written Informed Consent investigator record Case Report Form . Be willing able adhere instruction set protocol . Be exist successful daily wear soft contact lens wearer . For purpose study mean wear lens least 6 hour per day , 5 day per week last month . No extended wear last 3 month . Subjective refraction must result vertex correct spherical contact lens prescription 1.00 6.00 diopter . Have refractive astigmatism less equal 1.00 diopter ( D ) eye . Achieve visual acuity 6/9 ( 20/30 ) good eye . Require visual correction eye ( monovision allow ) . Have normal eye evidence abnormality disease . For purpose study normal eye define one : amblyopia , evidence lid abnormality infection ( include blepharitis/meibomitis ) , conjunctival abnormality infection , clinically significant slit lamp finding ( i.e . stromal edema , vascularization , infiltrate abnormal opacity ) , active ocular disease . Requires concurrent ocular medication . Clinically significant corneal stromal haze , corneal vascularization , tarsal abnormality , bulbar hyperemia , limbal hyperemia , abnormality cornea would contraindicate contact lens wear . Clinically significant corneal stain Requires presbyopic correction ( i.e . Not use presbyopic correction measure add power less +1.00 diopter ) . Has refractive surgery . Has eye injury/surgery within 8 week immediately prior enrollment study . Abnormal lacrimal secretion . Preexisting ocular irritation would preclude contact lens fit . Keratoconus corneal irregularity . Hard , hybrid Rigid Gas Permeable lens wear previous 8 week . Any systemic illness would contraindicate lens wear medical treatment would affect vision successful lens wear . Diabetic . Infectious disease ( e.g. , hepatitis , tuberculosis ) immunosuppressive disease [ e.g. , Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) ] . History chronic eye disease ( e.g . glaucoma Age Related Macular Degeneration ) . Pregnancy , lactate plan pregnancy time enrollment . Participation concurrent clinical trial last 30 day</criteria>
