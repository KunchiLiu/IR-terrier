	<brief_title>Neuroimaging Impact Treatment Neural Substrates Trust Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Substantial recent data highlight role social function primary moderator therapeutic response individual post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) interpersonal difficulty mistrust significantly negatively impact treatment efficacy ( Forbes et al. , 2003 ; Forbes et al. , 2005 ; Forbes et al. , 2008 ) . In addition , ample evidence suggest psychotherapy improve social interpersonal life psychotherapy client improve client ' ability regulate emotion reduce social isolation ( Yalom &amp; Leszcz , 2005 ; Foy et al. , 2000 ) . While considerable research dedicate explore neurobiology emotional dysregulation associate PTSD ( Rauch , Shin , &amp; Phelps , 2006 ; Etkin &amp; Wager , 2007 ) , increase data suggest diverse psychotherapy affect neural functioning ( Beauregard 2007 ) , little understood neurobehavioral pathology underlie debilitate interpersonal difficulty PTSD , neurobiological mechanism accompany improvement social function occur efficacious therapy . Thus , broad goal project two-fold . First , investigator seek examine neural substrate associate interpersonal dysfunction PTSD use social exchange game previously develop assess interpersonal trust cooperation healthy ( King-Casas et al. , 2005 ) psychiatric group ( Chiu et al. , 2008 ; King-Casas et al. , 2008 ) . Second , investigator seek examine change neurobehavioral substrate social function follow treatment Veterans PTSD . Specifically , investigator propose use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) behavior within well-characterized Trust Game examine neural substrate associate interpersonal trust cooperation Veterans PTSD prior follow empirically support psychotherapy cognitive processing therapy ( CPT ) PTSD . Thus , broad goal project two-fold . First , investigator seek examine neural substrate associate interpersonal dysfunction PTSD use social exchange game previously develop assess interpersonal trust cooperation healthy ( King-Casas et al. , 2005 ) psychiatric group ( Chiu et al. , 2008 ; King-Casas et al. , 2008 ) .
