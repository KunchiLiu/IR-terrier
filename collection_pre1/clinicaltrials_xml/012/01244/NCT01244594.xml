	<brief_summary>Background : People spinal cord injury ( SCI ) risk many health condition , decrease exercise . Cycling Functional Electrical Stimulation ( FES ) one way obtain exercise SCI . However , cycle FES do one way , involve pedal quickly less force work . Pedaling slowly would allow person work force , may lead great improvement bone mineral density muscle size . It may also lead great change bone make-up , body fat , cholesterol level . All improvement may lead decrease bone fracture cardiovascular disease , two major medical issue exist SCI population . Study Aims : This study compare outcomes bone , muscle cardiovascular health commonly use method pedal quickly new method pedal slowly . Both group work maximal force possible . It expect group pedal slowly work great force thus improve outcome compare group pedal faster . Methods : Twenty people SCI , age 18-65 year , randomly assign treatment group participate three 60-minute session per week 6 month outpatient rehabilitation center . All subject must complete paralysis leg , may sensation preserve . Before 6 month exercise , subject MRI scan ass muscle size bone , dexascan ass bone , strength test use electrical stimulation ass muscle force , analysis fat free body tissue , lab work measure cholesterol , bone factor provide insight bone change , nutritional status . Relevance : If protocol pedal slowly result great improvement , technique apply clinical practice . Some people SCI FES cycle home many cycle many year . This new technique may allow obtain benefit currently receive FES cycling . In addition , important maintain overall bone , muscle cardiovascular health people SCI health ready spinal cord regeneration become clinically available .</brief_summary>
