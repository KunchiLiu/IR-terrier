	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm surgically unresectable locally advanced metastatic ( stage IIIB/IV ) nonsquamous nonsmallcell lung cancer . Measurable disease document disease progression follow last prior therapy accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion , Version 1.1 . Have receive one two prior line systemic anticancer therapy therapy advance metastatic disease , one must platinumdoublet therapy . Patients receive adjuvant treatment eligible disease progression occur &lt; 6 month completion adjuvant therapy . Prior maintenance therapy allow consider line therapy continue without discontinuation initiation treatment regimen . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 Resolution toxic effect prior therapy ( include radiotherapy ) accord National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) , Version 4.0 , Grade ≤1 ( exception alopecia ≤grade 2 neuropathy ) . Subject must recover significant surgeryrelated complication . Demonstrate adequate bone marrow , liver , renal function , define : ALT , AST , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) subject liver metastasis ≤5.0 x ULN subject liver metastasis . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN ( ≤ 4 × ULN total ≤1.5 × ULN direct bilirubin acceptable subject Gilbert 's syndrome ) . ANC ≥1.5 × 10^9/L . Platelet count ≥100 × 10^9/L . Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL ( transfusion and/or growth factor support allow ) . Serum creatinine ≤1.5 × ULN creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min . Archival and/or fresh biopsy tissue sample must available biomarker determination . The status follow biomarkers collect study : EGFR KRAS mutation status prior randomization , MET status post randomization If childbearing/reproductive potential ( female male ) , must agree use doublebarrier contraceptive measure , oral contraception , avoidance intercourse study 90 day last investigational drug dose receive If female childbearing potential , must negative result pregnancy test ( serum urine ) within 72 hour prior initiate study treatment . Must sign date approve Informed Consent Form ( Including HIPAA authorization , applicable ) performance studyspecific procedure test . Subjects must fully inform illness investigational nature study protocol ( include forseeable risk possible side effect ) Prior therapy EGFR inhibitor and/or ARQ 197 ( know cMET inhibitor ) . Receipt systemic antitumor treatment NSCLC within 3 week prior randomization . Receipt palliative radiotherapy within 2 week radiotherapy curative intent target lesion within 3 week prior randomization . Lesions subject radiotherapy within 3 week prior randomization may use target lesion . Major surgical procedure within 3 week prior randomization . History cardiac disease : Congestive heart failure define Class II IV per New York Heart Association classification ; active coronary artery disease ; previously diagnose symptomatic bradycardia ( subject asymptomatic bradycardia heart rate 50 bpm allow ) cardiac arrhythmia define ≥Grade 2 accord NCI CTCAE , version 4.0 , uncontrolled hypertension ; myocardial infarction occur within 6 month prior study entry ( myocardial infarction occur &gt; 6 month prior study entry permit ) . Clinically unstable central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis ( enrol study , subject must confirmation stable disease MRI compute tomography ( CT ) scan within 4 week randomization CNS metastases well controlled steroid , antiepileptic symptomrelieving medication ) . Need breastfeed child within 12 week complete study . Significant gastrointestinal disorder , opinion investigator , could interfere absorption ARQ 197 and/or erlotinib ( eg , Crohn 's disease , small large bowel resection , malabsorption syndrome ) . Inability unwillingness swallow complete dos ARQ 197 erlotinib . Any known contraindication treatment , include hypersensitivity , ARQ 197 erlotinib . History malignancy NSCLC within 5 year prior randomization , exception adequately treat intraepithelial carcinoma cervix uterus ; prostate carcinoma prostatespecific antigen value &lt; 0.2 ng/mL ; basal squamouscell carcinoma skin .
