	<brief_summary>In 1991 Medical Research Council Vitamin Study Group 1992 Hungarian randomise clinical trial show conclusively risk neural tube defect reduce substantially take folic acid peri-conceptional period . At present enough evidence support hypothesis folic acid supplementation reduce risk congenital malformation specific select group , namely : neural tube defect , oral cleft , cardiac defect , urinary tract anomaly except hypospadias , limb reduction defect , omphalocele , anal atresia trisomy 21 . The hypothesis high intake folic acid relate high risk reduction neural tube defect congenital malformation main rationale present study . The present study randomize , double-blind , control trial evaluate whether supplementation folic acid high dose ( 4 mg/day ) reduce overall risk major congenital malformation population standard recommend dose ( 0.4 mg/day ) . At enrolment visit eligible woman interview assess sociodemographic , life style health status . After randomization , woman interview every 4 month evaluate pregnancy status . Women pregnancy diagnosis study period interview telephone expect 16 , 24 40 week gestation evaluate pregnancy outcome . The health status live birth evaluate child 's age 1 month , 3 month 1 year . The primary aim project conduct study assess effect folic acid periconceptional supplementation 4 mg/day compare 0.4 mg/day standard dose reduce occurrence congenital malformation . Secondary aim study include compare severity CMs offspring trial mother , rate `` select congenital malformation '' , rate twin , miscarriage , recurrent abortion , small-for-gestational age , preeclampsia abruptio placenta . The sample size easy compute lack robust estimate size effect treatment . Three hypothesis size effect 45 % , 26 % 13 % consider . A sample size outcome ( woman ) respectively 2,006 ( 5,015 ) , 8,510 ( 21,275 ) 30,126 ( 75,315 ) need . Since sample size need evaluate different scenario large , present study also pilot study promote international prospective meta-analysis .</brief_summary>
