	<brief_summary>In last ten year significant development CLL treatment . The advent fludarabine , rituximab association chemo-immunotherapy substantially increase overall response rate , CR rate , time progression may also impact overall survival . Even though , CLL remain incurable patient eventually relapse progressively become resistant treatment . The development effective therapy cross-resistant one currently available front-line treatment , one clinical unmet need within CLL . BendOfa non comparative phase II trial design determine therapeutic benefit bendamustine give together ofatumumab relapse resistant patient CLL . Bendamustine approve FDA CLL treatment , hybrid drug alkylating agent purine analogue property may lack cross resistance fludarabine . It utilized CLL single agent association rituximab currently clinical investigation . Ofatumumab new fully human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody high vitro efficacy CD20 low-expressing CLL cell . An early report show ofatumumab single therapy effective highly pre-treated refractory CLL patient . Both drug generally well tolerate without unexpected untoward toxicity . On basis data , bendamustine ofatumumab could new effective well tolerate combination patient relapse refractory CLL .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients CLL relapse initial response ( CR , PR ≥ 6 month ) follow two prior treatment line ; Patients CLL refractory ( SD , PD CR/PR &lt; 6 month ) follow two prior treatment line Patients require treatment accord 2008 revised IWCLL guideline No 2 prior treatment line Age old equal 18 year No active malignancy previous 5 year , exception currently treat basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma `` situ '' origin No prior treatment conventional chemotherapy within prior 4 week monoclonal antibody within prior 16 week ECOG performance status ≤2 study entry Laboratory test result within range : Serum creatinine ≤ 2 x UNL Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min ( Cockcroft Gault formula ) Total bilirubin ≤ 2 x UNL ( exception patient Gilbert 's syndrome ) AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2 x UNL non attributable CLL AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 10 x UNL attributable CLL Female subject childbearing potential ( FCBP ) must : Understands potential teratogenic risk unborn child need effective contraception ; Be capable comply effective contraceptive measure . Be inform understand potential consequence pregnancy need notify study doctor immediately risk pregnancy . Understand need commence study treatment soon study drug dispense follow negative pregnancy test . Understand need accept undergo pregnancy test base frequency outline protocol . Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) enrol protocol must agree use two reliable form contraception simultaneously practice complete abstinence heterosexual contact follow time period relate study : 1 ) start study drug ; 2 ) participate study ; 3 ) dose interruption ; 4 ) least 28 day study treatment discontinuation . The two method reliable contraception must include one highly effective method one additional effective ( barrier ) method . FCBP must refer qualified provider contraceptive method need . The following example highly effective additional effective method contraception : Highly effective method : Intrauterine device ( IUD ) Hormonal ( birth control pill , injection , implant ) Tubal ligation Partner 's vasectomy Additional effective method : Male condom Diaphragm Cervical Cap Implants levonorgestrelreleasing intrauterine system associate increased risk infection time insertion irregular vaginal bleeding . Prophylactic antibiotic consider particularly patient neutropenia . Pregnancy test . FCBP must two negative pregnancy test prior start study drug . FCBP must agree medically supervised pregnancy test every 4 week include 4 week end study treatment , except case confirm tubal sterilization . This requirement also apply woman childbearing potential practice complete continue abstinence . Females must agree abstain breastfeed study participation least 28 day study drug discontinuation . Male patient must : Understand potential teratogenic risk engage sexual activity pregnant female female childbearing potential . Must practice complete abstinence agree use prophylactic sexual contact pregnant female female childbearing potential participating study , dose interruption least 6 month follow study drug discontinuation , even undergone successful vasectomy . If pregnancy positive pregnancy test occur partner male study patient study participation , investigator must notify immediately . Female male patient instruct never give medicinal product another person return unused capsule study doctor end treatment . Should donate blood therapy least 28 day follow discontinuation study drug . Male patient donate semen sperm participate study , dose interruption least 6 month follow study drug discontinuation Signed write informed consent accord IGH/EU/GCP Italian law . Concurrent use anticancer agent Use experimental drug therapy within 28 day baseline Positive direct antiglobulin test ( DAT ) clinical laboratory sign hemolysis and/or autoimmune thrombocytopenia Known transformation CLL Known CNS involvement CLL Known positivity HIV active HCV HBV hepatitis . Active bacterial , viral fungal infection require systemic antiviral , antibiotic antifungal therapy . Any serious medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness would prevent subject signing informed consent form . Subjects current active hepatic biliary disease ( exception patient Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstone stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) Pregnant Lactating Females . Any condition , include presence laboratory abnormality , place subject unacceptable risk he/she participate study confounds ability interpret data study</criteria>
