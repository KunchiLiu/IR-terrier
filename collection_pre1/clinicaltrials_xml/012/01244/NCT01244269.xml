	<brief_summary>This project aim determine methylphenidate improve deficit attention symptom orthostatic hypotension , two common non-motor symptom , patient Parkinson 's Disease . This project also seek evaluate effect methylphenidate postural control patient , debilitate motor symptom place patient increase risk fall . This study build exist data support new indication use methylphenidate Parkinson 's Disease . Using standard objective evaluation , study quantify effect methylphenidate two dos attention level , orthostatic hypotension , measure postural control . Phase I study compare methylphenidate 10mg three time daily placebo Phase II study , tolerate low dose Phase I , compare methylphenidate 20mg three time daily placebo . By incorporate two different dos , study also seek determine improvement dose-related . Secondary endpoint include safety assessment ( adverse event monitoring vital sign ) perform every 30 minute follow supervised drug administration . Visual analog scale present participant treatment follow final dose treatment ass change fatigue . A secondary task add postural test assess influence cognitive process . It hypothesize methylphenidate demonstrate significant beneficial effect outcome . It project objective improvement observe follow treatment methylphenidate dos ( 10 20mg three time daily ) compare placebo . It hypothesize effect dose-related therefore profound high dos .</brief_summary>
