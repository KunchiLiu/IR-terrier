	<brief_summary>In patient ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) treat primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI ) subset low risk late complication identify . Early discharge ( &lt; 72h ) patient compromise initiation prophylaxis , information investigation . The researcher want investigate prospectively whether early discharge compare regular care comparable patient center outcomes 30 day follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The safety feasibility early discharge low-risk STEMI treat thrombolysis PPCI patient previously investigate . It possible identify subset patient low risk subsequent cardiac event short-term , prolonged hospital stay beyond three day alter outcome . Early discharge however , include STEMI management guideline formally . The effect discharge regimen STEMI patient ' health status ( symptom , functional capacity quality life ) previously investigate . Shorter hospital stay save health care resource . On hand , short in-hospital stay affect perceive satisfaction care . Initiation medical treatment , patient education , life style counsel follow-up routine may suffer . Additionally , early discharge increase anxiety symptom level reduce health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) also lead readmission . Patient satisfaction become recognised measure quality health care.Currently little information early discharge influence patient ' satisfaction health care subjective perceive HRQOL discharge . We therefore wish perform prospective trial compare outcome regard satisfaction care HRQOL patient admit STEMI randomise either early discharge standard care .</detailed_description>
