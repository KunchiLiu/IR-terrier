	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - To determine intraoperative fluid administration Deltex CardioQ esophageal Doppler reduce length stay elective bowel resection . - The probe use dynamically measure stroke volume cardiac output . This information assist u determine ideal amount fluid administer . - To determine fluid administration establish esophageal probe result shorter length stay elective bowel resection patient . - The investigator plan enroll 100 patient study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial With Deltex Cardio Elective Bowel Resection Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intraoperative goal-directed IV fluid administration utilize esophageal Doppler guide measure amount fluid look stroke volume determine little much fluid . It show inadequate fluid administration cause increase morbidity length stay elective bowel resection . However , data evaluate Doppler 's use postoperative period , intraoperatively . Our objective evaluate whether postoperative goal-directed fluid management Deltex CardioQ esophageal Doppler probe lead short hospital stay elective bowel resection patient . All consecutive patient randomize 'standard fluid ' group 'goal-directed fluid ' group . All follow standard surgical postoperative care exception fluid administration . If eligible , patient receive epidural catheter pain control . The 'goal-directed fluid ' group Deltex CardioQ probe place nasally operate room anesthesia team , fluid management administer via anesthesia protocol . The 'standard fluid ' group receive Deltex CardioQ probe.Patients 'goal-directed fluid ' group receive fluid accord body weight first 24 hour . The probe evaluate every15 minute Post Anesthesia Care Unit measurements take determine whether fluid give patient.On surgical floor , patient 'goal-directed fluid ' group evaluate every 8 hour fluid give necessary accord measurement take via probe .
