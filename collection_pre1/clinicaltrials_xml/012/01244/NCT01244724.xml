	<detailed_description>Rationale : Epilepsy chronic disorder adversely affect social , vocational , psychological functioning . Despite variety complexity negative clinical association epilepsy , depression remarkable prevalence related adverse effect health status . An estimated 30-50 % person refractory epilepsy major depression , depression strong correlation seizure rate quality life . Suicide one lead cause death epilepsy . Available data indicate depression may result underlie brain dysfunction rather social vocational disability . Most patient depression screen systematically diagnosis , subsequently treat . Although density serotonin receptor greatest limbic brain region commonly involve human epilepsy , mesial temporal prefrontal area , prior randomize control trial evaluate efficacy serotonin reuptake inhibitor depression epilepsy . Escitalopram may ideal SSRI patient antiepileptic medication lack pharmacokinetic drug interaction , expect , example , fluoxetine paroxetine . Study Hypothesis : Epilepsy patient major depression improve significantly course 12-week trial escitalopram . Significant improvement occur rating depressive symptom , physical symptom measure psychosocial function quality life . Primary Secondary objective : The primary objective pilot use escitalopram treatment major depression patient epilepsy . The secondary objective determine effect size scale measure depressive symptom , physical symptom , psychosocial function quality life , evaluate safety population patient epilepsy . These result use evaluate possibility future double-blind , placebo control RCT escitalopram treatment major depression patient epilepsy . Study design : An open-label design propose would first study escitalopram treatment major depression patient epilepsy . Treatment : Psychiatric evaluation do Dr. Kocsis , also monitor subject improvement psychiatrically , well potential adverse event agitation , psychosis , suicidality . Subjects note exacerbation depression develop suicidal ideation mania may medication stop change , base clinician judgement . SCID assessment do Dr. Bleiberg . Escitalopram begin 10mg . day . Visits occur biweekly 12 week . Subjects minimal response minimal side effect 4 week dose increase 20mg . day . The maximum dose escitalopram exceed FDA-approved maximum dose 20 mg per day . Safety Monitoring : Safety monitoring seizure worsen study consist follow : Subjects evaluate study neurologist prior start escitalopram complete seizure history , neurologic general physical examination . Anti-epileptic drug ( AED ) level obtain baseline visit well . The seizure count seizure type previous month document . A seizure severity score seizure type use National Hospital Seizure Severity Scale document . Subjects counsel take AEDs regularly . After escitalopram start , subject see every 4 week ( 3 visit ) neurologist brief visit , interim seizure medical history obtain , brief neurologic examination perform . Seizure count seizure severity obtain seizure type compare baseline . If doubling seizure count compare baseline seizure type month period , subject discontinue study escitalopram discontinue . Any less degree increase seizure frequency worsen seizure severity escitalopram treatment prompt discontinuation study depend judgement investigator . Primary secondary efficacy measure : Clinically rat outcomes HAM-D CGI , assess depressive symptom , physical symptom severity depressive syndrome . Self-rated assessment include IDS-SR depressive symptom , SAS-SR social/vocational function Q-LES-Q quality life . Safety assessment include hematology , chemistry , AED level , pregnancy test urine drug screen prior treatment . Hematology chemistry , AED level repeat week 12 termination . Vital sign adverse event systematically record visit . Occurrence seizures systematically logged course trial . Anticipated finding : The Wilcoxon signed-rank test apply mean score available weeks-1 0 vs. week 10 12 HAM-D , IDS-SR , SAS-SR Q-LES-Q respectively . We anticipate significant difference clinician-rated depressive symptom self-rated social function quality life pre- post-escitalopram treatment .</detailed_description>
