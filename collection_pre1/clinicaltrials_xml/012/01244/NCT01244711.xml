	<brief_title>Open-Label Pilot Study Examine Value Substituting Quetiapine Benzodiazepines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1.1 Background Numerous patient depression anxiety appear use benzodiazepine chronically respond incompletely conventional antidepressant . These patient likely request incur frequent change medication non-response , incomplete response intolerance . The hypothesis study symptom anxiety , depression insomnia ; index psychosocial function improve , BZ use decrease significantly twelve-week trial period substitute quetiapine benzodiazepine . 1.2 Rationale study The scientific rationale derive combination clinical observation review literature . Anecdotal clinical experience numerous patient depression anxiety suggest patient chronic benzodiazepine use less likely respond remit conventional antidepressant likely request incur frequent change medication non-response , incomplete response intolerance . Although patient drug abuser dos take within range recommend package insert drug ( e.g. , 5-20mg/ day diazepam equivalent ) , `` dependent '' sense take BZ daily almost daily , would give spite `` good response '' ( although often residual symptom anxiety insomnia ) antidepressant mood stabilizer , determine get prescription refill time often upset could . I hypothesize chronic benzodiazepine use create circadian ultradian cycle sedation , might experience fatigue amotivation , withdrawal , might experience anxiety insomnia . Patients often tinkered dos time dos attempt smooth cycle . The current study determine whether symptom anxiety , depression insomnia ; index psychosocial function improve , BZ use decrease twelve-week trial period substitute quetiapine benzodiazepine . This would proof concept study unique subpopulation MDD GAD . 2 . STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary objective For MDD : The primary efficacy measure change baseline endpoint MADRAS change mean daily benzodiazepine dose diazepam equivalent past week . For GAD : The primary efficacy measure change baseline endpoint HAM-A change mean daily benzodiazepine dose diazepam equivalent past week . 2.2 Secondary objective Secondary efficacy measure include response remission rate self-rated scale symptom psychosocial function ( IDS-SR depressive symptom , SAS-SR social/vocational function Q-LES-Q quality life ) . 3 . STUDY PLAN AND PROCEDURES 3.1 Overall study design study plan Subjects follow assure stable regimen antidepressant medication BZ least 8 week . Patients treat flexible dos quetiapine-ER 300mg/day 8 week . Dosing begin Seroquel 50 mg. bedtime escalate weekly Seroquel 100mg. , Seroquel-XR 200mg . Seroquel-XR 300 mg depend clinical response side effect . BZ dose gradually taper equivalent 5mg/day/week diazepam equivalent possible . This forced titration schedule . 3.2 Rationale study design , dose control group The design open-label , proof concept study . The dosing base prior clinical experience patient population . There control group . 3.4 Treatments 3.4.1 Identity investigational product comparators Seroquel-XR 50 mg. , Seroquel-XR100mg. , Seroquel-XR 200mg . Seroquel-XR 300 mg. 3.4.2 Doses treatment regimen Dosing begin Seroquel-XR 50 mg. bedtime escalate weekly Seroquel-XR 100mg. , Seroquel-XR 200mg . Seroquel-XR 300 mg depend clinical response side effect . 3.5 Pre-study , concomitant post-study treatment ( ) Prohibited medication study : - Potent cytochrome P450 inhibitor ( include limit ketoconazole , itraconazole , fluconazole , erythromycin , clarithromycin , troleandomycin , indinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , fluvoxamine saquinavir ) - potent cytochrome P450 inducer ( include limit phenytoin , carbamazepine , barbiturate , rifampin , St. John 's Wort , glucocorticoid ) - Any psychotropic besides quetiapine , antidepressant benzodiazepine . Other medication , consider necessary subject 's safety well-being , may give discretion investigator ( ) . The administration medication ( include investigational product ) must record appropriately . 4 . OUTCOME AND VARIABLES 4.1 Primary Variable For MDD : The primary efficacy measure change baseline endpoint MADRAS change mean daily benzodiazepine dose diazepam equivalent past week . For GAD : The primary efficacy measure change baseline endpoint HAM-A change mean daily benzodiazepine dose diazepam equivalent past week . 4.2 Secondary Variables Secondary efficacy measure include response remission rate self-rated scale symptom psychosocial function ( IDS-SR depressive symptom , SAS-SR social/vocational function Q-LES-Q quality life ) . 4.3 Efficacy Variable ( ) For MDD : The primary efficacy measure change baseline endpoint MADRAS change mean daily benzodiazepine dose diazepam equivalent past week . For GAD : The primary efficacy measure change baseline endpoint HAM-A change mean daily benzodiazepine dose diazepam equivalent past week . An overdose regard AE . All symptom associate overdose however report AEs . For information regard overdose , see section 11.2 . Pregnancy regard AE unless suspicion investigational product may interfere effectiveness contraceptive medication . For detail regard pregnancy , see section 11.3 . 4.4.1.3 Reporting serious adverse event Investigators site personnel must inform FDA , via Medwatch form , unexpected possibly Study Drug-related serious adverse event ( SAEs ) accord FDA reporting requirement timeline . The Investigator must also inform appropriate AstraZeneca representative SAE occur course study within one day ( ie , immediately late end next business day ) become aware . The investigator must also report follow-up information SAEs within one day . A copy MedWatch report must fax AstraZeneca time event report FDA . Reporting FDA recommend regardless whether IND require study . Additionally , Investigator shall provide AstraZeneca report SAEs qualify expedite report FDA ( e.g. , consider expect and/or relate ) least quarterly basis order AstraZeneca meet regulatory reporting obligation . If Study blind , Institution shall provide AstraZeneca code break information initial SAE report copy randomization schedule start Study , AstraZeneca may un-blind SAE report extent necessary meet global regulatory reporting requirement . A complete write SAE report must send cover page indicate follow : Drug Name ( Seroquel ) ; Investigator Sponsored Study ( ISS ) Research ( Protocol ) AstraZeneca Tracking Number [ IRUSQUET0483 ] Principal Investigator 's IND number assign FDA ( applicable ) Principal Investigator 's full name address Unblinding information ( applicable ) Send way fax Seroquel ISS Safety Representative ( 302 ) 885-3043 If non-serious AE become serious , relevant follow-up information must also provide AstraZeneca FDA within 1 day describe . All SAEs report AstraZeneca , whether consider causally related investigational product . All SAEs document . The investigator responsible inform IRB and/or Regulatory Authority SAE per local requirement . 4.4.2 Other safety measurement variable Safety assessment include vital sign visit hematology , chemistry , pregnancy test urine drug screen prior end treatment . 4.5 Volume blood sample handle biological sample The total volume blood drawn subject study follow : 30 cc 5 . DATA MANAGEMENT We develop standardized paper form collect data need study subject include eligibility , demographic baseline data , sequential clinical assessment , dose information , side effect , outcome measure . data require explore study hypothesis collect entered database appropriate format data analysis . 6 . STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 6.1 Description analysis population All analysis conduct intention-to-treat population . 6.2 Method statistical analysis The Wilcoxon signed-rank test apply mean score available week 0 vs. endpoint primary outcome measure : MADRS , HAM-A &amp; daily BZ dose , secondary outcome measure IDS-SR , SAS-SR Q-LES-Q respectively test question whether difference pre- post-quetiapine treatment . Separate test conduct two diagnostic group ( MDD GAD ) , intent compare two . The proportion priori-defined responder remitters study report descriptive statistic . 6.3 Determination sample size NA The N 20 per group dictate budget feasibility consideration . This pilot study control comparison group . Under 2-tailed Î± value .05 , power detect large effect size .</detailed_description>
