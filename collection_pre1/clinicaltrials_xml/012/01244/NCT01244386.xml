	<brief_summary>The purpose study validate use low-dose computed tomography ( CT ) protocol facilitate reduce radiation dos patient inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . This achieve use new computer software ( Iterative Reconstruction Automatic Tube Modulation ) enable low-dose CT imaging dos equivalent abdominal radiograph .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-dose CT Using Iterative Reconstruction Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The increase use CT prompt development new scanning protocol reduce radiation dose patient minimise likelihood radiation relate morbidity . The use disease specific low-dose CT examination emerge method limit radiation dos . Research conduct Cork University Hospital ( CUH ) current author identify press need reduce radiation dose patient IBD . A retrospective study radiation dose patient Crohn 's disease demonstrate increase number CT exam perform average cumulative effective dos rise 7.9 25mSv first 5-years 15 year study period compare final 5-years . Eight-five percent dose final 5-year period due CT . Younger patient severe disease require surgery steroid likely undergo increase number exam . 15.5 % patient receive cumulative effective dos great 75mSv . This quantity radiation exposure associate 7.3 % increase mortality cancer . In addition , patient Crohn 's disease inherently predispose gastrointestinal hepatobiliary carcinoma small bowel lymphoma . As alternative CT , IBD patient frequently image conventional abdominal radiography . The effective dose conventional abdominal radiograph ( CAR ) approximately 10 % standard abdominal CT vary 0.7 -0.1mSv . The current author also investigate value CAR . We retrospectively examine 500 CAR 's perform 16 year period patient IBD . Patients average 3.5 CAR 's perform positive finding le 30 % exam . Many finding non-specific require investigation . For example separation bowel loop plain radiograph wide differential diagnosis include abscess formation , presence phlegmonous mass , fibrofatty proliferation , bowel wall thicken lymphadenopathy . Patients inflammatory bowel disease refer CUH undergo modify abdominal CT protocol . The radiation dose standard CT abdomen pelvis divide 2 quotient . Patients low-dose CT scan require approximately 10 % dose standard abdominal CT . This equate radiation dose conventional abdominal radiograph . Patients imaged second CT exam use 90 % standard abdominal CT dose ensure diagnostic study acquire . Patients give oral intravenous contrast agent standard CT . Patients C-reactive protein measure day CT height weight also measure time scan . Patients plain film abdomen perform prior CT .</detailed_description>
