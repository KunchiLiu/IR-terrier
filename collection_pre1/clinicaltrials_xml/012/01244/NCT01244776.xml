	<brief_title>Transplantation Acellular Corneal Matrix Treat Corneal Ulcer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infections , chemical injury , diseases result acute chronic corneal ulcer , may damage corneal stroma may lead permanent corneal scar blindness . Corneal transplantation standard method corneal ulcer , severe shortage donor corneas limit application . Acellular porcine corneal matrix similar native cornea , especially biological property microstructure . Recently , matrix prove safe transplant animal subject reject recipient . In animal lamellar keratoplasty experiment , acellular corneal matrix show integrate corneal wound bed help reconstruction lamellar integrity corneal stroma . This study investigate heal effect human corneal ulcer . It provide potential corneal substitute disease .</detailed_description>
