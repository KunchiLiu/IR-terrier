	<detailed_description>Tourette 's Syndrome neurological disease characterize verbal motor tic . Although cause unknown , many researcher believe change brain chemical ( call neurotransmitter ) critically involve . One neurotransmitter call dopamine , exert action receptor ( call D1-type D2-type ) . It suggest symptom Tourette 's Syndrome due overactivity D1-type receptor . Ecopipam selective antagonist D1-type receptor . The present clinical trial design test ecopipam able relieve symptom disease adult patient Tourette 's Syndrome .
