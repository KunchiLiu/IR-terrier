	<brief_summary>Antibiotics use routinely postoperative tissue expander base breast reconstruction ( TE ) autologous flap ( AF ) breast reconstruction procedure . Closed suction drain also use routinely immediate breast reconstruction prevent fluid accumulation seroma formation surgical site . Antibiotics often prescribe precaution since drain source infection create open channel outside contaminant . Plastic surgery patient without closed suction drainage device usually place prolonged postoperative antibiotic . Current preoperative surgical antibiotic prophylaxis recommend 24 hour . These recommendation take account increase risk indwelling close suction drain . A recent survey plastic surgeon , conduct SBUMC investigator , ( IRB # 129415 ) find Plastic Surgeons divide extended outpatient administration follow TE breast reconstruction . The study plan prospectively enroll patient undergo immediate breast reconstruction TE AF base breast reconstruction . Using data current protocol , investigator investigate optimal antibiotic discontinuation period patient . The investigator hypothesize use 24-hour perioperative antibiotic TE AF base immediate breast reconstruction close suction drainage , result increase infection rate compare prolong postoperative antibiotic administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Antibiotics use routinely postoperative tissue expander base breast reconstruction ( TE ) autologous flap ( AF ) breast reconstruction procedure . Closed suction drain also use routinely immediate breast reconstruction prevent fluid accumulation seroma formation surgical site . Antibiotics often prescribed precaution drain may serve open channel outside contaminant . Plastic surgery patient without closed suction drainage device usually place prolonged postoperative antibiotic . Current preoperative surgical antibiotic prophylaxis recommend 24 hour . These recommendation take account increase risk indwelling close suction drain . Current plastic surgery literature provide recommendation consensus antibiotic discontinuation follow immediate breast reconstruction . A recent survey conduct 650 plastic surgeon show 98 % respondent give preoperative antibiotic , 91 % provide antibiotic 24 hour . Additionally , 71 % respondent prescribe postoperative outpatient antibiotic . There divide discontinue antibiotic among plastic surgeon give postoperatively . 46 % preferred continue antibiotic drain removal , 52 % preferred specific postoperative day , commonly day 5 7 . In survey , majority ( 97 % ) surgeon use IV Cefazolin choice preoperative prophylaxis oral Cephalexin ( 75.4 % ) Cefadroxil ( 14.3 % ) outpatient antibiotic . Currently Stony Brook University Medical Center , patient normally receive 24 hour IV Cefazolin , follow postoperative antibiotic prescription Cefadroxil . Antibiotics discontinue final drain remove . The study plan prospectively enroll patient undergo immediate breast reconstruction TE AF base breast reconstruction . Using data current protocol , investigator investigate optimal antibiotic discontinuation period patient . The investigator randomize patient two group . One group receive current antibiotic regimen 24 hour IV Cefazolin , follow outpatient Cefadroxil . Antibiotics discontinue group final drain remove . The group receive 24 hour IV Cefazolin without additional outpatient antibiotic , recommend elective clean surgery . In patient penicillin allergy sensitivity , clindamycin , IV oral use . The randomization apply patient . Rationale early discontinuation postoperative antibiotic : Studies associate prolonged antimicrobial prophylaxis development resistant bacterial strain follow surgical procedure . No evidence report supporting practice continue antibiotic drain remove . A single dose preoperative IV antibiotic suggest sufficient prophylaxis breast surgery patient discharge home drain .</detailed_description>
