	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect 4-week consumption California walnuts vascular function immune health postmenopausal woman age 50-70 . Primary outcome measure : - vascular endothelial function - platelet reactivity - indoleamine 2 , 3-deoxygenase ( IDO ) Secondary outcome measure : - relationship walnut intake lipoprotein , fatty acid oxylipins</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease lead cause morbidity mortality United States . The initiation progression atherosclerotic vascular disease multifactoral nature , include endothelial dysfunction , trigger chronic inflammation . The consumption food rich flavonoid phytochemical inversely associate cardiovascular disease risk several epidemiological study . Aging physiologically associate variable decline several feature immune function . In fact , immunosenescence , age immune system , characterize reduced ability fight infection mount adequate immune response novel infection introduce . Both innate acquire immune system affect immune specific cell , cell signaling , cytokine production , cell surface marker expression subject age-related change . The immune system cell within digestive tract accessible ideal target stimulate immunity diet-based nutritional intervention represent non-invasive , relatively low-cost , effective method stimulate immune function thus ultimately improve antibody production subject risk immunosenescence . This also base significant dynamic interaction luminal nutrient overall immune function . The study nutritional influence immune system represent area grow interest nutritionist , food scientist immunologist . In general term , dietary component potential accessible effective immune stimulant give antigen present capacity intestine . Due age menopausal status , postmenopausal woman great risk population develop CVD . Males tend show great rate CVD pre-menopausal woman , woman follow menopause show increase CVD development . This increase CVD postmenopausal woman associate endothelial dysfunction become bad age . Recent study report consumption walnut associate beneficial effect prevention chronic disease , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , favorably alter human serum profile ( i.e . decrease LDL cholesterol triglycerides increase HDL cholesterol apolipoprotein A1 ) . It show consumption walnut , mainly contain α-linolenic acid ( ALA ) , L-arginine , polyphenols , beneficially alter vascular function reduce inflammatory biomarkers . For example , Dr. Ros colleague demonstrate addition walnut high-fat meal could improve endothelial function . This favorable influence vasoactivity attribute antioxidant anti-inflammatory property certain biofactors find walnut . In study , focus define potential role California walnuts effect vascular health immune function . We determine whether short term ( 4 week ) consumption California walnut , particularly rich ALA , L-arginine polyphenols improve endothelial function , platelet reactivity immune function at-risk population postmenopausal woman 55-70 year age .</detailed_description>
