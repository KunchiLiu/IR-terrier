	<brief_summary>Malignant glioma aggressive among common brain tumor . A diagnosis carry median survival approximately 12 month , 90 - 95 % patient survive less 2 year . The current standard treatment surgical resection follow radiation therapy chemotherapy substantially prolong survival . Dendritic cell ( DCs ) immune cell form part mammalian immune system . Their main function process antigen material present surface cell immune system , thus function antigen-presenting cells.In present study , DCs use antigen presentation glioma antigens directly induce cytotoxic T-cell response . Cytokine-induced killer ( CIK ) cell show heterogeneous population , major population express T cell marker CD3 NK cell marker CD56 , term NKT cell , show significant anti-tumor activity clinical trial animal study . Furthermore , CIK cell able expand significantly culture DCs , CIK cell activate DCs stimulation ( DCIKs ) characteristic cytotoxic activity enhance show increase anti-tumor activity . This study aim evaluate clinical efficacy DCIK cell treatment combine DCs follow tumor resection radiotherapy patient malignant glioma .</brief_summary>
