	<brief_title>MK-2206 , Paclitaxel Trastuzumab Treating Patients With HER2-overexpressing Solid Tumor Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine safety maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) MK-2206 combination paclitaxel trastuzumab give patient HER2-overexpressing solid tumor malignancy . MK-2206 oral drug ( take mouth ) turn protein call AKT inside cancer cell . This could helpful treat treatment-resistant cancer , AKT allow cell survive despite active anticancer treatment . In case HER2-positive cancer , laboratory study suggest drug combination MK-2206 paclitaxel trastuzumab may effective .</detailed_description>
