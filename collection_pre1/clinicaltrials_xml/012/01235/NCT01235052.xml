	<brief_summary>Head neck cancer sixth frequent cancer worldwide , exclude lymphomas skin cancer . If 18FDG PET consider today standard tool patient head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) tumoral nodal staging also assessment distant metastasis synchronous second primary malignancy , hypoxia one important prognostic factor radiotherapy type tumor . The gold standard method direct determination oxygen tension base use oxygen electrode show good relation clinical outcome complex realisation . So , PET use 18F-FMISO describe useful non invasive assessment hypoxia cancer . Especially France , use radiotracer limit standardised methodology acquire quantify 18F-FMISO signal . So need rigorous evaluation PET tracer . In another way , could useful tool evaluation new therapy modification volume radiotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypoxia one major worst prognostic factor clinical outcome cancer . It actually admit hypoxia heterogeneous , variable within different tumour type varies spatially temporally tumor . Hypoxia induce proteomic gene expression change lead increase angiogenesis , invasion metastasis . So , hypoxic fraction solid tumour reduces sensitivity conventional treatment modality , modulate therapeutic response ionize radiation certain chemotherapeutic agent . This particularly important head neck cancer ( HNC ) . Hypoxic cell solid tumour could influence local failure follow radiotherapy associate malignant progression , loco regional spread distant metastases represent increase probability recurrence . Thus , non-invasive determination monitor oxygenation status could tumours importance predict patient outcome eventually modify therapeutic strategy tumours . Today , oxygenation status individual tumour assess routinely . Numerous different approach propose identify hypoxia tumour . Eppendorf oxygen electrode measurement ( pO2 histography ) may consider 'gold standard ' hypoxia human malignancy . However , invasive method confine superficial , well accessible tumour require many measure . PET use [ 18F ] Fluoro-deoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) , allow non-invasive image glucose metabolism take grow place cancer staging , But 18F-FDG ca n't assess correctly oxygenation status tumour . PET appropriate radiotracers enable non-invasive assessment presence distribution hypoxia tumour . Nitroimidazoles class electron affinic molecule show accumulate hypoxic cell vitro vivo . [ 18F ] -FMISO frequently use tracer ; intracellular retention dependent oxygen tension . Consequently , [ 18F ] -FMISO use non-invasive technique detection hypoxia human . Different author demonstrate suitable localize quantify hypoxia . Thus , [ 18F ] -FMISO PET study evaluate prognosis predict treatment response . However , investigator report unclear correlation Eppendorf measurement standardize uptake value ( SUV ) . This observation may explain structural complexity hypoxic tumour tissue . Nevertheless , need standardized procedure acquire quantify [ 18F ] -FMISO uptake . Today , use tracer limit clinic academic study include small population patient suffer heterogeneity technical procedure . The aim study determine optimal acquisition protocol image reconstruction describe [ 18F ] -FMISO uptake HNC , , validate [ 18F ] -FMISO-PET predictive marker response treatment .</detailed_description>
