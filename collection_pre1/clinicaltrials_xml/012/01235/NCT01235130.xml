	<brief_title>Multi_center Study Evaluate Effect N-3 Fatty Acids ( OMEGA-3 ) Arrhythmia Recurrence Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) represent common arrhythmia clinical importance . The prevalence AF general population estimate 1 % , 300,000 Canadians , rise . Current strategy AF preserve normal sinus rhythm include pharmacological therapy agent demonstrate intermediate efficacy significant adverse effect . Newer non-pharmacological strategy pulmonary vein ablation suitable minority patient expensive method treatment . As result , simple , safe , inexpensive effective strategy treat AF preserve sinus rhythm require give great health financial burden condition represent society . Omega-3 `` n-3 '' polyunsaturated fatty acid ( n-3 fatty acid ) represent novel approach prevention treatment AF . N-3 fatty acid know anti-arrhythmic property associate low risk sudden ( arrhythmic ) death . Additionally , n-3 fatty acid significant anti-inflammatory property potential anti-oxidant effect . Higher consumption non-fried fish recently show confer lower incidence new onset AF elderly adult . N-3 fatty acid might therefore represent useful strategy maintenance sinus rhythm patient AF , give potential act several mechanism simultaneously . We seek test hypothesis current clinical trial proposal .</detailed_description>
