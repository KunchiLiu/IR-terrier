	<brief_summary>This within-participant comparison study investigate efficacy 28-day regimen MK-0873 2 % cream twice day ( b.i.d . ) compare MK-0873 vehicle ( match placebo ) b.i.d . well positive control comparator calcitriol 0.0003 % ( 3 µg/g ) participant plaque psoriasis . In order enrol study , patient need least two pair ( lesion AB CD ) approximately similar plaque lesion severity size surface area involve locate approximately symmetric region trunk limbs body . Participants randomly assign apply either MK-0873 MK-0873 vehicle plaque A B randomly assign apply MK-0873 calcitriol plaque C D. It hypothesize MK-0873 cream formulation administer participant psoriasis topical route result statistically great percent target lesion severity ( TLS ) reduction plaque lesion MK-0873 Vehicle Day 29 .</brief_summary>
