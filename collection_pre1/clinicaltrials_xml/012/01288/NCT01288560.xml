	<brief_summary>Medical image one fast grow sector health care increase utilization underscore need ensure image technology develop use effectively . Evaluation clinical economic impact image lag behind technology development . Heart failure ( HF ) represent final common pathway form heart disease morbidity mortality remain high . There need identify image approach positive impact therapy decision , patient outcome cost . As well standard method evaluate new emerge technique well test potential clinical management setting . The OVERALL OBJECTIVES IMAGE-HF trial 1 ) determine impact emerge image strategy , relevant clinical outcome decision make patient HF ; 2 ) establish standardization quality assurance ( QA ) measure central database order achieve reliable outcome drive research ; 3 ) apply platform evaluation new emerge image biomarkers HF . Project I-A : The PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF AIMI-HF compare effect HF imaging strategy composite clinical endpoint cardiac death , MI , resuscitate cardiac arrest cardiac re-hospitalization ( WHF , ACS , arrhythmia ) . Patients ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) etiology follow HF imaging strategy algorithm accord question ( ) ask physician ( ischemia and/or viability ) , agreement local practice standard alternative imaging . Secondary objective AIMI-HF To compare effect HF imaging strategy 1 . The incidence revascularization procedure ( PCI , CABG ) 2 . LV remodeling : LV volume , LVEF 3 . HF symptom , NYHA class 4 . QOL ( MLHFQ , EQ5D ) 5 . The evolution serum prognostic marker HF ( e.g . BNP , RDW , hs-cTnT , hs-CRP ) 6 . Health economics : Costs estimate regression analysis cost effectiveness assess decision modeling . 7 . The safety image test measure cumulative radiation , adverse reaction image contrast agent stress test agent also determine . 8 . The evolution renal function ( eGFR ) LV remodeling-associated biomarkers ( e.g . PIIINP , OPN ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IMAGE-HF Project I-A : Cardiac Imaging Ischemic Heart Failure ( AIMI-HF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among patient coronary artery disease HF , mortality rate range 10-60 % 1 year . Many trial demonstrate benefit revascularization patient ischemic heart disease ( IHD ) LV dysfunction . Some criterion , severe angina leave main coronary artery stenosis may indicate need surgical therapy HF patient ; however , large number patient fall gray zone without clear evidence benefit surgical intervention . The need remain approach help good define select HF patient likely benefit revascularization ; could either surgical percutaneous intervention . Increasingly past three decade , information describe cardiac structure , perfusion , hemodynamics , metabolism obtain noninvasive cardiac imaging study use guide management decision patient HF . AIMI-HF part large Canadian team grant IMAGE-HF ( Imaging Modalities Assist Guiding therapy Evaluation patient Heart Failure ) involve 3 parallel randomize trial address role image HF patient accord HF etiology . Primary Hypothesis AIMI-HF : In patient HF due IHD LVEF less equal 45 % , management algorithm applies alternative image strategy ( PET CMR ) achieve well clinical outcome measure composite clinical endpoint ( CCE ) cardiac death , MI , resuscitate cardiac arrest cardiac re-hospitalization ( WHF , ACS , arrhythmia ) approach `` standard care '' . Secondary Hypotheses AIMI-HF : ) Compared standard care , patient HF due IHD LVEF ≤ 45 % , management algorithm applies alternative image modality ( PET CMR ) achieve : ) efficient use revascularization procedure similar complication rate standard care image strategy b ) good LV remodeling ( include favorable evolution serum marker associate LV remodel e.g . PIIINP , OPN ) c ) good HF angina symptom reduction , ) good QoL , measure use MLHFQ EQ5D , e ) favorable evolution select serum marker prognosis HF ( e.g . BNP , RDW , hs-cTnT , hs-CRP ) f ) economically attractive patient HF due IHD LVEF &lt; 45 % . ii ) In patient HF due IHD LVEF ≤ 45 % , HF management algorithm applies PET achieve good primary composite clinical endpoint ( CCE ) secondary outcome ( revascularizations , remodel , QoL , Cost efficiency ) compare one applies CMR . iii ) Renal function impairment know independent predictor cardiovascular event HF . Renal function may influence revascularisation decision evolution could modify revascularisation procedure . Study design AIMI-HF IMAGE-HF Project 1-A trial ; prospective comparative effectiveness study compare effect HF imaging strategy patient HF due IHD . Eligible patient LV systolic dysfunction due IHD evaluation ischemia viability relevant . Patients prospectively randomize standard ( SPECT ) versus advance ( PET CMR ) imaging . Patients meet inclusion criterion randomize due clinical management decision , yet undergo standard advance imaging ( SPECT , PET/CT CMR ) , enter registry . Based site screen log , patient could randomize , meet inclusion criterion underwent standard advance imaging , retrospectively enrol , date original HREB approval , study registry participant . Registry recruitment monitor ensure balanced recruitment modality registry .</detailed_description>
