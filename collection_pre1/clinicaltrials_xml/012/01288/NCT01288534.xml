	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability use radiation therapy 5 fraction radiation treat prostate cancer guidance radiation use Calypso 4D Treatment System ( Calypso ) .A number recent study use 5 radiation fraction treat prostate cancer 2-3 week compare typical treatment would involve 40-42 small radiation fraction 8-9 week . This type radiation use small number treatment call hypofractionated radiation therapy . The Calypso new technique use beacon implanted prostate use radio signal able localize track position prostate continuously radiation therapy . The Calypso system approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) guidance radiation therapy treatment prostate cancer utilized across United States . However , test hypofractionated radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
