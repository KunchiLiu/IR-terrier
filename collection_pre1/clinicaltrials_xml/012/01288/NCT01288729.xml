	<brief_summary>This open-label cross study look compare length infusion set wear teflon catheter ( Quick-Set ) steel ( Sure-T ) catheter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Duration Infusion Set Function : Quick-Set Teflon Catheter Versus Sure-T Steel Infusion Set Catheter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently infusion set approve 2-3 day wear . In study subject wear infusion set 7 day infusion set fails . Subjects alternate wear Quick-Set Teflon catheter Sure-T steel catheter week . They wear infusion set twice . For study , subject provide investigational Medtronic Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitor ( CGM ) Enlite Sensor/Serter help identify , serious hyperglycemia hypoglycemia study . This sensor yet FDA approve , similar commercially available sensor . If sensor detects high low glucose , subject must obtain fingerstick glucose confirm result . In study , insulin dose treatment decision make use glucose meter result , base sensor result . Subjects instruct identify infusion set failure . Infusion set failure define : 1 ) Blood ketone great 0.6 mmol/L , 2 ) Evidence infection infusion site ( redness 4 mm ) , 3 ) Blood glucose decrease least 50 mg/dL within 1 hour correction bolus treat blood glucose great 300 mg/dL . Subjects follow-up weekly one test center total five visit . At home subject ask keep log record measurement redness induration infusion site change prior study visit .</detailed_description>
