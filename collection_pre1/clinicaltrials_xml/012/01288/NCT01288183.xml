	<brief_title>Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) Treatment Tobacco Addiction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tobacco estimate cause 5 million yearly death develop world . Although smoker would like quit , relapse rate remain high . It seem relapse link process craving , powerful desire smoke elicit smoke deprivation exposure situation cue associate smoking . Neuroimaging study show dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , especially right part , critically involved process crave smoking . Increasing activity DLPFC noninvasive brain stimulation demonstrate effective decreasing craving symptom cigarette smoker . The aim study determine whether powerful technique noninvasive brain stimulation , transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , could reduce cigarette smoking . tDCS painless safe brain stimulation method capable modulate cortical excitability . The nature modulation depend stimulation polarity : anodal tDCS think cause neuronal depolarisation thus enhance cortical excitability whereas cathodal stimulation propose reduce excitability . The investigator hypothesize anodal tDCS apply repetitively right DLPFC could constitute treatment tobacco addiction . Therefore , investigator conduct sham-tDCS-controlled , randomize , double-blind study .</detailed_description>
