	<brief_summary>Some patient brain tumor receive standard radiation help prevent tumor growth . Although standard radiation kill tumor cell , also damage normal tissue process lead side effect . This research study look different form radiation call proton radiotherapy help spare normal tissue deliver radiation tumor tumor bed . Proton techniques irradiate 2-3 time less normal tissue standard radiation . This therapy use treatment cancer information research study suggest therapy may help good target brain tumor standard radiation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Participants receive proton radiotherapy Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center locate Massachusetts General Hospital . They receive proton radiotherapy 5 day per week . The number week participant receive proton radiotherapy depend upon tumor type location well tolerate treatment .

	<criteria>Biopsy proven low grade glioma astrocytoma , ependymoma , craniopharyngioma , meningioma , neurocytoma , medulloblastoma gangliogliomas rare tumor require tumor bed tumor irradiation . Patients presumed diagnosis optic glioma glioma base image clinical characteristic also allow trial . Patients biopsy proven high grade glioma ( exclude GBM ) gross total resection patient nondisseminated atypical teratoid rhabdoid ( ATRT ) may also include . Pathologic diagnosis must base pathology pathology review Department Pathology MGH another DF/HCC institution . Age 125 year . Life expectancy great 1 year .

Participants radiotherapy site treat . Participants know spinal distant metastasis . Patients ependymoma , medulloblastoma germinoma must metastatic workup include spine MRI rule metastasis . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant breastfeed woman . Patients participate contribute neurocognitive outcome due severe neurologic impairment language barrier ( ie English Spanish speaking ) exclude study .</criteria>
