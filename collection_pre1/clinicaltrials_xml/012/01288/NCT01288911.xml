	<criteria>Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation small cell feature Ongoing androgen deprivation therapy Luteinizing Hormone Receptor Hormone ( LHRH ) agonist antagonist stable dose schedule within 4 week randomization bilateral orchiectomy ( i.e. , surgical medical castration ) Metastatic disease document one following : At least two bone lesion bone scan , Soft tissue disease document computed tomography ( CT ) / magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , Unequivocal pelvic adenopathy short axis &gt; 2.0 cm diameter CT/MRI Progressive disease study entry define one follow three criterion occur set castrate level testosterone : Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) progression define minimum three rise PSA level interval ≥ 1 week determination . The PSA value ≥ 2 µg/L ( 2 ng/mL ) ; Soft tissue disease progression define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 ; Bone disease progression define two new lesion bone scan Asymptomatic mildly symptomatic prostate cancer ( i.e . score Brief Pain InventoryShort Form ( BPISF ) Question # 3 must &lt; 4 ) ; use opiate analgesic prostate cancerrelated pain currently anytime within 4 week prior randomization Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 , include subject decrease performance status attribute progressive symptomatic prostate cancer Estimated life expectancy ≥ 12 month Able swallow study drug comply study requirement A male subject female spouse/partner childbearing potential must use two acceptable method birth control ( one must include condom barrier method contraception ) start Screening continue throughout study period , 3 month final study drug administration . Two acceptable form birth control include : 1 . Condom ( barrier method contraception ) , AND 2 . In addition condom , one follow acceptable form contraception require : Established use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) . Barrier method contraception : Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository . Tubal ligation least 6 month prior Screening Vasectomy surgical castration least 6 month prior Screening Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy prostate cancer Severe concurrent disease , infection , comorbidity would make subject inappropriate enrollment Known suspect brain and/or skull metastasis active epidural disease History another malignancy within previous 5 year curatively treat nonmelanomatous skin cancer Current prior treatment estrogen and/or drug antiandrogenic property spironolactone &gt; 50 mg/day , progestational agent treatment prostate cancer within 6 month prior randomization Current prior use ketoconazole treatment prostate cancer Use antiandrogens within 6 week prior randomization Documented prior disease progression receive antiandrogens . Disease progression define PSA progression , radiographic progression and/or clinical deterioration . Current prior treatment 5α reductase inhibitor anabolic steroid within 6 month prior randomization Prior use systemic glucocorticoid ( equivalent 10 mg prednisone ) within 3 month prior randomization expectation use study Radiation therapy bone lesion prostatic bed within 4 week prior randomization Major surgery within 2 month prior randomization History seizure include febrile seizure condition may predispose seizure ( e.g. , prior stroke , brain arteriovenous malformation , head trauma loss consciousness require hospitalization ) . Also , current prior treatment antiepileptic medication treatment seizures history loss consciousness transient ischemic attack within 12 month prior randomization Clinically significant cardiovascular disease include myocardial infarction within past six month uncontrolled angina within past three month</criteria>
