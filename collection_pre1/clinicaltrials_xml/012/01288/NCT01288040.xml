	<detailed_description>Coordination legs walk often disrupt neurological injury , result asymmetric gait pattern . Recent data show walk pattern alter treadmill training , even central nervous system damage . The investigator study short-term adaptation inter-limb coordination walk use split-belt treadmill control speed two leg independently . Our finding demonstrate walk pattern adaptable , process dependent cerebellar integrity . The investigator also show people cerebral damage stroke benefit short-term correct asymmetric walking pattern . Since previous work focus single training session , investigator would like study long-term effect split belt treadmill train . Therefore , purpose study prepare clinical trial split-belt treadmill train treat walk pattern deficit cerebral damage . The investigator gather data determine whether different schedule type long-term training custom split-belt treadmill likely change/improve walk symmetry . The investigator study subject without cerebral damage . Subjects without hemiparesis simply train daily 2 week understand learn new pattern treadmill comparison patient . Subjects hemiparesis undergo train daily 2 week dose training , spread 4 week . Training subject hemiparesis either conventional treadmill walk split-belt treadmill walk one leg move faster . The investigator study child adult hemiparesis . These study provide important new information normal mechanism locomotor adaptation , well provide new rehabilitation tool people asymmetric gait pattern . Note study aerobic condition program since subject work well age-adjusted target heart rate ; instead retrain program aim teach people new inter-limb coordination pattern . This study also critical develop procedural reliability process , calculate effect size , train clinical staff , determine salient clinical variable preparation randomize clinical trial .</detailed_description>
