	<brief_title>A Study DS-2248 , Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct two part . Part 1 dose escalation study subject cohort give increase dos study drug maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) maximum administer dose ( MAD ) determine recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) . The drug administer oral capsule daily 21 day cycle , interruption cycle unacceptable treatment-related toxicity tumor progression observe . After determine RP2D , Part 2 study , dose expansion study begin subject advance non-small cell lung cancer develop acquire resistance epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) -tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) , erlotinib , gefitinib , afatinib ( others ) whose tumor carry ALK translocation resistant ALK inhibitor therapy , treat DS-2248 RP2D . The drug administer oral capsule daily 21 day cycle , interruption cycle unacceptable treatment-related toxicity tumor progression observe .</detailed_description>
