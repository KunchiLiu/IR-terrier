	<brief_title>TMC649128HPC1001 - First In-human Trial Examine Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics ( How Drug Absorbed Into Bloodstream ) Increasing Single Oral Doses TMC649128 Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TMC649128 investigate treatment chronic hepatitis C infection . This Phase I , first human ( clinical study perform date ) , double-blind ( neither participant investigator know whether receive active placebo ) , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , placebo-controlled study examine safety , tolerability , blood plasma pharmacokinetics increase single oral dos TMC649128 . The single dose escalation consist 6 session ( Sessions I IV ) 6 panel ( Panels 1 6 ) 9 healthy adult volunteer . The dose TMC649128 consecutively escalate . In session , 6 participant receive TMC649128 3 participant receive placebo , standard meal . Each session stagger approach , ie , first 4 participant dose , follow least 72-hour safety review acute effect observe , remain 5 participant dose . The main focus trial determination safety tolerability TMC649128 single oral dos feed condition healthy volunteer , also determination pharmacokinetic characteristic ( level-profile TMC649128 time blood stream urine ) . This evaluation require multiple blood sample Day 1 Day 4 . Safety assessment ( blood urine test , blood pressure , pulse , electrocardiogram , physical examination ) follow different schedule perform session , 4 week last administration . Safety tolerability evaluation record regular interval throughout trial . The single dose escalation consist 6 session 6 panel 9 healthy adult volunteer . The dose TMC649128 consecutively escalate .</detailed_description>
