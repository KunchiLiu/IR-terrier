	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial conduct subject uncomplicated Plasmodium vivax malaria November 2010 March 2012 . The aim study compare efficacy safety artesunate-amodiaquine plus primaquine ( AS-AQ + PQ ) dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus primaquine ( DHP + PQ ) uncomplicated vivax malaria . The significance study find alternative drug treat patient vivax malaria case standard treatment available become resistance . This study give thorough information efficacy safety 2 artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACTs ) combination primaquine . It also inform Indonesian Ministry Health suggest policy radical cure vivax malaria , provide evidence base treatment option chloroquine resistant vivax malaria . This study also provide information prevalence glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency G6PD variant North Sumatera population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study ACTs Plus Primaquine Uncomplicated Plasmodium Vivax Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The emergence spread drug resistance major problem control malaria . Resistance chloroquine P. vivax first detected 1989 spread part world . In Indonesia , resistance P. vivax chloroquine emerge many part country , range 50 % failure rate Papua 20 % failure rate Nias , North Sumatera . Artemisinin derivatives potent rapidly act antimalarial drug available nowadays also seem effective treatment vivax malaria , number study evaluate limited . If artemisinin combination therapy ( ACTs ) combine drug eliminate parasite liver , primaquine , optimize treatment P. vivax infection . The addition course primaquine provide radical cure relapse , importantly reduce transmission infection gametocyticidal effect . Since 2008 , Indonesian government deploy artesunate-amodiaquine ( AS-AQ ) first line treatment uncomplicated vivax malaria promote radical cure add primaquine ( PQ ) . For 50 year , Indonesia use standard dose primaquine ( 0.25mg/kg 14 day ) sometimes without prior test G6PD status patient screen test usually available especially remote area . Unfortunately , data evaluate safety efficacy standard dose . Patients fever history fever precede 48 hour attend public health centre study area ( study centre ) examine . Thick thin blood smear take , stain examine light microscope . Slides carefully read ( accord procedure ) P. vivax malaria . The patient assess trial doctor , meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion , receive detail explanation study &amp; enrolment condition trial staff . If agree participate study , sign inform consent form randomize receive either AS-AQ plus PQ DHP plus PQ . Essential laboratory test ( hemoglobin , methemoglobin ) perform , filter blood paper G6PD genotyping collect . No patient screen G6PD status . Oral treatment dose give close observation , vomit within half hour re-dosed ; vomit withdrawn . Patients manage outpatient ask return clinic daily , fourteen consecutive day , day 1-14 ) receive physical examination , laboratory test study treatment adverse event monitoring , weekly day 21 , 28 , 35 , 42 day feel unwell . Patients miss appointment schedule day day 3 still include study appear next day ( 24 hour ) , visit home . Patients develop acute hemolytic attack symptom reduction hemoglobin treatment closely observe transfer hospital blood transfusion need withdrawn study . After day 42 , patient visit home every month ( ± 1 week schedule day still accept ) 1 year . Each patient give serial number appointment card mark date follow-up .</detailed_description>
