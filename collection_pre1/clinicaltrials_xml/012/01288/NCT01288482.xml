	<brief_summary>Traditional , continuous-mode nebulizer English-Wright nebulizer design operate continuously tidal breathing . As inhalation account one-third respiratory cycle , two-thirds continuously produce aerosol lose environment possibly pose hazard fellow-patients , family member , health-care worker vicinity . The English-Wright American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) recommend device available market . Recently Roxon Medi-Tech announce discontinuation English-Wright nebulizer . For reason necessary review use nebulizer AeroEclipse II breath-actuated nebulizer validate performance . The investigator expect show equivalence AeroEclipse II English-Wright nebulizer .</brief_summary>
