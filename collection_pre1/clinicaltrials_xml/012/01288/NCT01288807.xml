	<brief_title>Effect Milnacipran Pain Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia ( FM ) chronic pain condition significant morbidity . Current research suggest primarily central mediation widespread pain include central sensitization spinal level abnormal pain process cerebral level . Findings FM patient include abnormal neurotransmitter level cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , abnormal activation cerebral pain process area abnormal peripheral pain sensory threshold . Continuous low level spinal cord activation primary nociceptive afferent ( C A delta fiber ) believe significantly drive central sensitization . One major spinal neurotransmitter release pain fiber substance P ( SP ) . Several study show FM patient three time higher baseline SP level CSF compare control . Since spinal neurotransmitter release therefore nociceptive afferent activity also regulate via descend inhibitory pathway release norepinephrine ( NE ) serotonin ( 5HT ) , decreased activity pain modulating system could also involve abnormal pain processing FM . Indeed , support literature decrease CSF level NE 5HT metabolite . Milnacipran , NE 5HT reuptake inhibitor , show potentially effectively reduce FM pain symptom FM affect pathology . The investigator propose open label clinical trial milnacipran 200 mg 12-weeks order investigate pain pathway FM patient peripheral spinal level treatment . In addition , investigator assess pain intensity symptom FM , treatment . To determine peripheral effect , investigator characterize systemic neurotransmitter release metabolites plasma . The investigator also measure heart rate variability use electrocardiogram look effect sympathetic nervous system .</detailed_description>
