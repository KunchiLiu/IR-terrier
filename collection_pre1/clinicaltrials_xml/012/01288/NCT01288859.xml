	<detailed_description>Polyphenolic compound abundant food suggest exert several health benefit include prevention cancer , cardiovascular disease , suppress inflammation , diabetes , etc . These property mediate bioavailability individual polyphenols , turn , influence food property ( food matrix , technological processing , etc . ) , interaction compound , host related factor . Some well-studied dietary polyphenols include catechin tea , curcumin turmeric , procyanidins anthocyanidins grape , berry , dark chocolate . These compound strong antioxidative activity vitro suggest several beneficial health effect . Curcumin , phenolic compound derive turmeric spice , show many biological pharmacological effect , clinical study humans prove 's extremely safe well tolerate even high dos ( 8-12 g/day ) . However , curcumin yet approve therapeutic agent , low bioavailability depend poor absorption , rapid metabolism rapid systemic clearance . Different approach investigate improve curcumin bioavailability . Among , use adjuvant interfere metabolic pathway curcumin , like piperine , represent one main strategy use enhance bioavailability . A approach consist manufacture curcumin contain liposome , phospholipid complexes nanoparticles . For polymer-based nanoparticles , maintenance biological activity , increase absorption delay delivery report . Cocoa base product widely consume many country , indication health benefit cocoa constituent , mainly polyphenols , also report . Cocoa contain high level polyphenols , particular flavanols among , mainly epicatechins . The bioavailability cocoa polyphenols measure several human study acute consumption cocoa rich beverage chocolate . Monomeric flavonoid well dimeric trimeric procyanidins detect human plasma 2-3 hour consumption . Plasma concentration cocoa polyphenols often nanomolar low micromolar range . Donovan coworkers demonstrate commercial available chocolate sample contain predominance less bioavailable ( - ) -catechin enantiomer compare ( + ) -catechin present plant derive food . This may explain relatively low bioavailability catechin chocolate cocoa-containing product . The food matrix seem important factor may affect bioavailability cocoa polyphenols . For instance , proteins food matrix suppose form highly polymerize complex procyanidins , reduce bioaccessibility phenolic compound . However , potential negative effect protein content food confirm study evaluate cocoa polyphenols bioavailability intake milk-powder cocoa beverage . However , concurrent carbohydrate consumption seem increase significantly uptake flavonols human . Little known whether extent oligomeric procyanidins cocoa absorb . However , biological activity procyanidins high polymerization degree may partly attribute colonic breakdown product , include phenolic acid . Actually also grow interest biological property phenolic compound addition antioxidant effect ; particularly , evidence suggest certain dietary phenol may modulate metabolic homeostasis . This case chlorogenic acid , report play potential role modify pattern intestinal glucose uptake flavonoid ( quercetin , catechin ) may modulate activation GLP-1 receptor , involve modulation insulin glucagon secretion , gastric emptying , appetite . In randomized , crossover trial , serum , urine fecal concentration curcumin cocoa polyphenols , parental compound , metabolites phenolic acid , follow two day multi-dose administration six food source , measure . All volunteer undergo six intervention - bread enrich three different form curcumin ( free , encapsulate , encapsulated plus piperine ) nut base cream enrich cocoa polyphenols ( free encapsulate one ) control cream ( without enrichment ) . A one-week wash-out period include two sequential treatment . Blood , urine feces collect time 0 ( baseline ) , 24 , 48 hour ; blood sample 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 hour consumption first meal , urine sample 2 hour time interval 10 hour , collect . In particular , area curve ( AUC ) serum urine concentration parental compound metabolite time interval 0-24 hour calculate primary outcome . In addition amount total polyphenols fecal sample measure .</detailed_description>
