	<brief_title>ACCESS-Europe A Two-Phase Observational Study MitraClipÂ® System Europe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PHASE I : The primary objective ACCESS-EU Phase I gain information European Union Countries regard use MitraClip System respect health economics clinical care . PHASE II : ( HAS BEEN CLOSED BY SPONSOR ) The primary objective ACCESS-EU Phase II gather additional clinical data , specifically Echocardiography Core Laboratory measurement MR severity leave ventricular volume diameter , echocardiographic measure , patient undergo MitraClip procedure European Union Countries , Clinical data collect study phase , expect contribute decision making regard MitraClip therapy selection patient MR : ( ) establish value MitraClip therapy continuum care ; ( b ) provide practical information allow physician make therapeutic decision , assist hospital make purchasing decision , assist insurer make coverage decision . Study Design : ACCESS-Europe two-phase prospective , observational , multicenter post-approval study MitraClip System treatment mitral regurgitation ( MR ) European Union Countries . Patients evaluate per standard practice baseline , discharge , 6-Months 12-Months . Phase I study consist patient receive MitraClip system treatment MR two concurrent comparator group ( ) medically manage heart failure patient MR ( b ) patient undergone mitral valve surgery MR . The two comparator group follow evaluate primarily health economic perspective . ACCESS EU Study Phase II consist patient receive MitraClip System , objective collect additional clinical data , specifically Echocardiography Core Laboratory evaluation MR severity echocardiographic measure . Enrollment patient study phase follow : ACCESS-EU PHASE I : - A minimum 300 MitraClip Therapy group patient , - A minimum 100 patient Mitral Valve Surgery comparator group - As many patient possible Medical Therapy comparator group First Patient Enrollment Projection : Q1 , 2009 Last Patient Enrollment Projection : Enrollment Mitral Valve Surgery Medically Therapy group cease December 31 , 2010 . Enrollment MitraClip group cease Phase II study initiate site . ACCESS-EU PHASE II : A minimum 300 MitraClip therapy subject enrol Phase II . First Patient Enrollment Projection : Q2 , 2011 Last Patient Enrollment Projection : Enrollment cease Sponsor determine adequate number patient enrol .</detailed_description>
