	<detailed_description>n-3 n-6 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( LCPUFA ) essential particularly neurodevelopment newborn infant . Many variation essential PUFA LCPUFA content human milk observe accord country dietary habit mother . Maternal diet supplementation LCPUFA lactate woman may increase LCPUFA human milk accord consensus recommendation . This clinical trial perform evaluate effect different consumption n-3 fatty acid ( linolenic acid ) different form ( oil margarine ) human milk composition . Each diet last 30 day . During first period 15 day , mother receive mediterranean diet base olive oil .
