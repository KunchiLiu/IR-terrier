	<detailed_description>Background . Ascites frequent complication liver cirrhosis carry significant worsen prognosis . Medical treatment uncomplicated ascites base diuretic associate mild reduction dietary sodium intake . Approximately 10 % patient per year develop refractory ascites , define International Ascites Club , either lack response medical treatment onset diuretic-induced complication preclude use effective dosage . Refractory ascites associate increased incidence severe complication cirrhosis , hepatorenal syndrome ( HRS ) , hyponatremia , spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( SBP ) , umbilical hernia rupture strangulation . Thus , overall probability survival patient refractory ascites poor , approximately 30 % 2 year . Furthermore , development refractory ascites greatly deteriorate patient 's quality life substantially raise health cost , due frequent need hospitalization invasive procedure . Repeated large-volume paracentesis widely accept therapy refractory ascites , although early recurrence fluid accumulation occur almost invariably . Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt ( TIPS ) usually effective prevent recurrence , procedure perform safely select patient . Finally , refractory ascites represent indication liver transplantation patient contraindication . Renal sodium retention ascites formation consequence portal hypertension effective hypovolemia . The background effective hypovolemia advance cirrhosis represent arteriolar vasodilation , mainly occur splanchnic circulatory area evokes compensatory activation neuro-humoral system able promote vasoconstriction renal retention sodium water . Based pathophysiological consideration , preservation central blood volume represent major purpose management patient advance cirrhosis . Albumin constitute approximately half protein plasma healthy individual , responsible 70 % plasma oncotic pressure . It play , therefore , pivotal role modulate distribution fluid compartment . However , albumin carry biological property , molecule drug transport , free radical scavenging , anti-inflammatory activity , relevant several circumstance disease . Finally , several control and/or randomize study show albumin administration effective prevent circulatory dysfunction large-volume paracentesis renal failure SBP , treat HRS give together vasoconstrictor . Furthermore , currently believe capacity expand central blood volume cirrhosis superior several plasma-expanders . In contrast , chronic use albumin treat ascites still debate , due lack definitive scientific evidence support clinical benefit . Thus , absence large multicenter randomize study together high cost human albumin explain albumin infusion usually include among therapeutic option difficult-to-treat ascites . Objectives . The objective present study define effectiveness prolong administration human albumin treatment liver cirrhosis ascitic decompensation . This goal reach perform multicenter , prospective , randomized clinical trial compare efficacy chronic albumin administration top standard medical treatment versus standard medical treatment alone patient cirrhosis ascites . The specific objective present study , therefore , establish whether chronic albumin administration top standard medical treatment improve patient outcome . Design Study . The study conduct 42 Italian clinical center choose high specialization management patient liver cirrhosis . The study population consist 440 in- out-patients affect liver cirrhosis uncomplicated ascites . Patients cirrhosis uncomplicated ascites randomize two treatment group : - standard medical therapy ( control ) - standard medical therapy plus albumin infusion Within 24 hour randomization , patient start albumin infusion dose 40 g twice weekly 2 week , 40 g weekly rest study ( 18 month ) . Patients develop refractory ascites study , follow completion 18 month period need least 3 paracentesis/months . Human albumin , 20 % solution - 50 ml , available market , store hospital Pharmacies participate Centers give patient control visit . Once eligibility study ascertain , centralized random allocation treatment group achieve mean web-based service accessible Internet . Patients give alpha-numeric identification code randomize ratio 1:1 ( standard medical treatment : standard medical treatment plus albumin ) . Randomization stratify accord follow condition : - Large volume paracentesis last month ( yes ; ) - Hyponatremia , reliable marker renal function ( &lt; 135 mmol/L ; ≥ 135 mmol/L ) Concomitant Therapies : patient uncomplicated ascites treat mild hyposodic diet ( approximately 100 mEq/die Na+ ) diuretic . According inclusion criterion , patient enter study receive least 200 mg/die antimineralocorticoid drug 25 mg/die furosemide . Dose change ( increase/decrease ) diuretic therapy permit basis evolution ascites decompensation . Total paracentesis perform presence tense ascites symptom due accumulation abdominal fluid follow administration 8 g albumin per liter remove ascites . Patients develop refractory ascites study period treat repeated total paracentesis . TIPS consider patient present contraindication procedure 3 therapeutic paracentesis per month need . Complications SBP HRS treat accord current indication , include albumin infusion . There allow concomitant medication study . Enrollment : duration study patient 18 month randomization . The enrollment patient last 18 month competitive center . Visit Schedule : initial visit , patient evaluate every month . Treatment interruption : patient fully entitle stop his/her participation study , time . Moreover , patient participation study interrupt deem beneficial his/her health . Treatment interrupt one follow condition occur : - Orthotopic liver transplantation - TIPS - Need 3 paracentesis/month ( indication TIPS ) - Patient refusal continue - Medical judgment Safety Evaluation : evaluation human albumin safety consist monitor registration adverse event , serious adverse event , laboratory test , vital sign . All event manage report compliance applicable regulation , include final clinical study report . Specific disease-related adverse event collect documented part safety data consider waive expedited reporting Regulatory Authorities . In study , follow SAEs consider related underlying condition thus consider unexpected unless course , intensity specific feature Investigator , accord his/her best medical judgment , considers event exceptional context medical condition : - hepatic encephalopathy - hepatocellular carcinoma - gastrointestinal bleeding variceal bleed - bacterial peritonitis - bacterial infection - hepatorenal syndrome renal failure non-fatal fatal outcome - non-fatal cholestasis - deterioration liver function ( hyperbilirubinaemia , increased transaminase , coagulopathy ) - serum electrolyte imbalance - muscle cramp Statistical Methods . The study design demonstrate effect prolong albumin supplementation improve survival patient liver cirrhosis uncomplicated ascites within 18 month randomization . The sample size calculation base primary end-point define calculated use Sample Power module include SPSS11.0 , SPSS Inc , Chicago , USA . - Hypothesis : 35 % mortality ( due cause ) group patient undergo standard medical care 20 % mortality group patient receive albumin ( Wong al , J Hepatol , 2011 ) . In order state difference mortality two group statistically significant 95 % probability , 210 patient per arm enrol ( power 90 % ) . These figure calculate assume constant drop rate equal 0.04 per interval . Ancillary Study . An ancillary optional study perform subset patient analyze non-oncotic property albumin . This base recent novel observation binding , transport , detoxification capacity human albumin severely compromised patient liver cirrhosis impairment correlate degree liver failure .</detailed_description>
