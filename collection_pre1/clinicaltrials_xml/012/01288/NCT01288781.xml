	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether increased pressure head elevate people suffer High Altitude Headache . We hypothesise head pressure elevate people High Altitude Headache .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intracranial Pressure Experimental Models Headache</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High Altitude Headache primary symptom Acute Mountain Sickness . However , present reason individual suffer High Altitude Headache others remain unknown . It widely believe elevated pressure within brain lead stretch pain sensitive fibre thus headache . However , evidence raise intracranial pressure High Altitude Headache currently unavailable . Therefore , study aim examine proxy measure intracranial pressure ( Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter ) person visit High Altitude , half give drug acetazolamide know reduce headache symptom .</detailed_description>
