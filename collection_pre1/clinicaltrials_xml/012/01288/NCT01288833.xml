	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize high definition colonoscopy close focus narrow band image feature high diagnostic accuracy colorectal polyp histology , replace formal pathologic assessment case high diagnostic confidence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study Real Time Colorectal Polyp Diagnosis During Colonoscopy - VALID Colonoscopy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A recent single arm prospective cohort study suggest high definition colonoscopy narrow band image acceptable strategy diagnose polyp histology determine future surveillance interval . Endoscopic proficiency macroscopic feature differentiate polyp histology attain relatively short time period . A new high definition colonoscope close focus narrow band image feature may improve diagnostic accuracy polyp differentiation , replace formal pathologic assessment case high diagnostic confidence . Primary Aim : Compare diagnostic accuracy high definition narrow band image colonoscopy without close focus feature macroscopic differentiation neoplastic non-neoplastic colorectal lesion use histopathologic diagnosis reference standard . Secondary Aims : Compare diagnostic characteristic colonoscope , measure concordance high confidence accuracy , compare accuracy predict versus actual surveillance interval recommendation , perform cost-effective analysis endoscopic versus pathologic diagnosis , measure advance pathology colon cancer surveillance , measure complication .</detailed_description>
