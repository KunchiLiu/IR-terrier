	<brief_title>Use Optical Coherence Tomography Determine Optimal Management Patients With Drug-eluting Stents Who Need Non-cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive drug-eluting stent ( DES ) subsequently require non-cardiac surgery increase risk perioperative stent thrombosis , especially antiplatelet therapy discontinuation require . Perioperative administration glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor may decrease stent thrombosis risk , cumbersome carry high cost . Stents endothelialized optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) likely low risk perioperative stent thrombosis therefore intensive management strategy , `` bridge glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor '' would require . The current study ass whether OCT utilization help optimize preoperative management DES patient require major non-cardiac surgery . The specific aim proposal examine impact OCT IVUS-guided management patient prior DES implantation need major non-cardiac surgery discontinuation dual antiplatelet therapy perioperative ( 1 week prior surgery 30 day post surgery ) incidence major adverse cardiac event . The hypothesis OCT IVUS-guided treatment low incidence ( ≤10 % ) perioperative major adverse cardiac event . The specific aim proposal examine impact OCT IVUS-guided management patient prior DES implantation need major non-cardiac surgery discontinuation dual antiplatelet therapy perioperative ( 1 week prior surgery 30 day post surgery ) incidence major adverse cardiac event . The hypothesis OCT IVUS-guided treatment low incidence ( ≤10 % ) perioperative major adverse cardiac event .</detailed_description>
