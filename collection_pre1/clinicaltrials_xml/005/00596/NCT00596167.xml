	<brief_summary>Short-daily hemodialysis increasingly become prefer alternative conventional intermittent ( three time per week ) hemodialysis schedule . Studies show short-daily dialysis improve patient 's quality life , high blood pressure , anemia calcium-phosphorus balance . Infection , however , likely remain persistent problem dialysis patient regardless frequency treatment . There currently wealth information guide doctor much frequently give antibiotic patient receive intermittent ( thrice weekly ) hemodialysis . However , little information prescribe antibiotics patient 's receive short-daily hemodialysis . This study develop drug dose guideline patient receive short-daily hemodialysis three frequently use antibiotic , vancomycin , levofloxacin gentamicin . These guideline assist doctor patient receive effective dose frequency antibiotic treat infection . The follow study hypothesis test two-sided , one sample t-tests compare AUC observe historical measures8 . 1 ) Vancomycin , levofloxacin gentamicin remove great extent short-daily hemodialysis intermittent hemodialysis . The follow specific aim : 1 . Determine interdialytic pharmacokinetics vancomycin , gentamicin , levofloxacin short-daily HD . 2 . Determine extent vancomycin removal administer last hour short-daily HD . 3 . Develop drug-dosing guideline vancomycin , gentamicin levofloxacin patient receive short-daily HD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite improvement dialysis machine filter technology refinement provide adequate `` dose '' HD , patient receive thrice-weekly hemodialysis ( HD ) alarm 20 % annual mortality rate . Concomitant high mortality rate , patient end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) also endure poor quality life medical complication anemia , infection , accelerate cardiovascular disease bone disease associate calcium-phosphorus disequilibrium . Recently , quotidian dialysis regimen , include short-daily nocturnal modality , emerge dialytic approach appear improve patient 's quality life attenuate medical complication associate ESRD1- 4 . Specifically , recent study document improvement patient 's quality life measure general instrument ( SF-36 ) renal disease specific tool . Short-daily HD regimen also lead improvement anemia allow reduction dose erythropoietin . Similarly , one study blood pressure control improve short-daily HD extent majority study patient eventually antihypertensive medication . Phosphorus control also improve hemeral especially nocturnal short-daily regimen . In one study patient receive nocturnal HD , patient completely wean phosphorus binder actually require intradialytic phosphorus supplementation . Finally , nutritional status also appear enhanced study short-daily HD increase appetite weight gain observe . The medical benefit observe study believe secondary enhance solute clearance well extra-cellular volume management short-daily HD affords compare intermittent HD . In particular , nocturnal regimen appear especially effective since provide high `` dose '' HD hemeral counterpart . According recent United States Renal Data Service ( USRDS ) compilation , infection continue exact heavy toll among dialysis patient . The recent USRDS mortality rate attributable sepsis dialysis patient 27.0 % . Despite reported improvement quality life medical complication provide short-daily HD , infection likely remain persistent medical issue dialysis patient . As result , appropriate provision antibiotic therapy patient receive hemodialysis remain paramount . Currently , study evaluate pharmacokinetics commonly use antibiotic grow short-daily HD population . With specific guideline , pharmaco-kinetic estimation frequent drug level utilize direct antibiotic dosing . This likely best therapeutic approach may cost-effective . This study attempt address deficit clinical knowledge three commonly use antibiotic , vancomycin , levofloxacin gentamicin . The drug dose guideline develop study ensure patient population receive optimum antibiotic therapy treat infection cost-effective manner . Utilizing drug level data yet unpublished study removal gentamicin thrice weekly dialysis , configure pharmacokinetic modeling software ADAPT compare serum level gentamicin intermittent short-daily HD . For short-daily HD simulation , ADAPT software demonstrate two period increase removal gentamicin correspond two session short-daily HD ( Figure 1 ) . The purpose present study demonstrate vivo indeed true gentamicin , well vancomycin levofloxacin .</detailed_description>
