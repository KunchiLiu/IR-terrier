	<brief_summary>Patients undergo posterior spinal fusion ( PSF ) procedures scoliosis risk iatrogenic neurologic injury spinal cord and/or spinal nerve root surgical correction abnormal spinal curvature . The degree neurologic injury range minor sensory deficit complete paraplegia . Surgeons CHOP utilize neurophysiologists identify impend neurologic injury . These consultant monitor spinal cord pathways record analyze evoked potential operation . Evoked potential low voltage electrical signal generate response transcranial transcutaneous electrical stimulation motor sensory neural pathway . Some patient undergoing PSF receive injection morphine cerebrospinal fluid operation . This intrathecal ( IT ) morphine potent analgesic effect . While commonly use anesthetic agent well-characterized effect evoke potential , little data exists effect IT morphine transcranial electric motor-evoked potential ( TceMEPs ) . This prospective observational study characterize effect IT morphine TceMEPs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Posterior spinal fusion surgery ( PSF ) associate significant postoperative pain . Numerous postoperative pain management strategy employ patient undergoing procedure , include continuous narcotic infusion , intravenous patient-controlled opioid analgesia , epidural analgesia , intrathecally administer narcotic , combination regimens . Most patient CHOP pain manage intravenous patient-controlled opioid analgesia alone combination single dose intra-operatively administered intrathecal ( IT ) morphine . Patients undergoing spinal fusion procedure also risk perioperative neurologic injury . Surgeons CHOP institution routinely utilize neurophysiologists evaluate at-risk neural pathway identify impend spinal cord spinal nerve root injury . These consultant monitor motor sensory pathway record analyze evoked potential electromyography operation . Evoked potential low voltage electrical signal generate response transcranial transcutaneous electrical stimulation motor sensory nerve . At CHOP , IT morphine inject surgeon scoliotic curvature correct spinal instrumentation complete . This injection therefore occur critical period neurophysiologic monitor risk spinal cord injury . It inject neurophysiologist give reassure assessment neural integrity . This injection give patient spinal fusion extend second lumbar vertebral body . Injections limit group patient appropriate intervertebral space intrathecal injection expose procedure extend level . Most commonly use anesthetic agent well-characterized effect evoke potential . The effect IT morphine sensory-evoked potential study . However , little data exist effect transcranial electric motor-evoked potential . This study aim characterize effect ; hypothesize intrathecal morphine effect transcranial electric motor-evoked potential dos use institution .</detailed_description>
