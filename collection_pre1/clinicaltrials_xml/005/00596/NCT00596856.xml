	<detailed_description>The project `` Development Dissemination Priority Oral Health Risk Assessment Referral Tool - PORRT '' design education train intervention medical dental practice statewide . Various evaluation activity , purpose subcontract , take place four year ( see attach timeline ) . The project collect data statewide use guideline change occur medical dental practice adopt guideline . In addition RCT 75 site , measure adoption rate guideline use quality effectiveness referral occur result guideline adoption . This multi-phase project logical next step work IMB medical practice throughout state seek incorporate dental provider increase referral child whose dental care manage medical home . And seek revise systematic review literature risk assessment form use IMB practice . The planning phase project focus development refinement risk assessment referral tool ( PORRT ) . This accomplished systematic review literature provide scientific evidence risk factor ECC , sufficient information derive literature , develop three-state ( normal , non-cavitated cavitated lesion ) Markov-model enable comparison ECC incidence rate among child different risk factor . A revised PORRT support evidence guidance use pilot test five medical practice year 1 project ( site select tool complete ) . This pilot conduct OHS . Results pilot incorporate development final tool accompany documentation ( guideline ) use implementation education intervention select 75 RCT site . ( The education intervention responsibility OHS . ) Prior initiation RCT , statewide baseline survey carry year 2 primary care medical provider see least 10 Medicaid patient three year age per month . This self-completed , mail survey assess oral health knowledge regard infant toddler , likelihood adoption PORRT instrument medical practice . ( The questionnaire yet develop submit later date IRB approval along accompany consent form . ) Data entry analysis take place UNC follow normal procedure maintain confidentiality protection human subject . The randomized controlled trial begin year 2 . The education intervention dissemination PORRT tool guideline occur select 75 RCT practice . The RCT compare passive distribution guideline mail in-office intervention consist guideline distribution combine educational outreach provide train guideline use patient mediate information provide risk referral assessment tool ( PORRT ) . The three-arm trial consist 25 medical practice never participate IMB 25 practice currently participate , receive guideline mail , 25 practice currently participate IMB receive intense in-office training intervention . We hypothesize effect measure ( guideline implementation , referral quantity , quality effectiveness ) favorable practice intense intervention , least favorable practice participate IMB program somewhat effective practice participate IMB receive passive dissemination guideline . Six month follow initiation education intervention , site visit RCT practice take place collect copy complete PORRT form conduct brief interview practice manager use adoption tool . The OHS responsible visit implement agency grant . Copies complete PORRTs send UNC data entry analysis . Data form enter project staff ACCESS base data entry system , password protect . No personal identifier enter . All PORRT form store locked filing cabinet . PORRT data use measure quantity referral activity among RCT practice ( percent patient PORRTs , number referral make , percent form referral , completeness form ) . Beginning three month follow start education intervention dental record review refer patient take place one geographic area ( county ) pertain intense intervention site RCT . The OHS responsible conducting record review dental office locate geographic catchment area medical practice . The objective record review collect information referral receive participate medical provider , treatment provide dental office refer patient . The evaluation data look risk disease status patient refer care . The record review data analyze UNC . The data allow u evaluate quality referral activity occur result intense education intervention PORRT distribution . Referral effectiveness evaluate look pre post treatment Medicaid claim geographic area ascertain portion patient dental visit . The follow-up provider survey conduct statewide year 3 project . The result survey allow u look use guideline barrier implementation , compare RCT non-RCT practice . The final phase project focus data analysis manuscript preparation . The statewide implementation education intervention determine result RCT .</detailed_description>
