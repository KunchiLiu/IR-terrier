	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether possible improve immune response rate 'flu vaccination patient chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( CLL ) . Annual flu vaccination recommend patient CLL know susceptible infection particularly chest infection may occur complication influenza . Protection 'flu depend patient high level antibody 'flu virus . Vaccination work stimulate immune system thus boost level protective antibody . CLL patient weaken immune system due leukaemia also follow chemotherapy . The exact cause immune defect know . However , CLL patient typically low antibody level immune cell may work normally . Unfortunately , study show patient CLL good making antibody 'flu vaccination result protection flu reliable . Recent study show 15-20 % CLL patient achieve protective antibody level . Recently new type medical cream introduce treat certain skin condition . Its name Imiquimod license treat viral wart genital area type skin cancer call basal cell carcinoma . It work increase immune response skin . Animal study show well increase immunity viruses cancer , increase response vaccination apply site vaccination . In study propose test whether new medicine improve response 'flu jab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Trial Summary 68 patient stage A CLL treat , 34 healthy age sex match volunteer fulfil entry requirement identify invited take part study . Blood sample take baseline study [ FBC , U &amp; E , LFT , Immunoglobulins ( Igs ) , haemagglutinin titre ] ( 20 ml ) T cell study ( 50 mls frozen ) .If CLL prognostic factor already determine 20ml take . Patients randomize either : Group A Vaccination current trispecific influenza vaccine Day 1 Group B Vaccination current trispecific influenza vaccine Day 1 , together application Imiquimod cream vaccination site day 2 6 . Blood sample take day 0 haemagglutinin study ( 20 ml ) T cell ( 50ml frozen ) , day 7 , 14 T-cell study ( 50 ml ) day 28 haemagglutinin study ( 20 ml ) . During 28 day subject participate trial approximately 190 ml take total . Antibody T-cell response influenza virus assess compare two patient arm study control group .</detailed_description>
