	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate mucus ( phlegm spit ) broken form airway ( bronchial tube ) people lung disease . This research study also examine whether blood group effect lung function type mucus find lung . This study design treatment asthma , emphysema , cystic fibrosis , lung disease . It design help investigator learn cause airway disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Mucinase Activity Airway Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accumulation mucus airway involve process overproduction reduce clearance mucin glycoprotein . To date , little attention focus mechanism mucin clearance airway . We hypothesize enzymatic degradation mucin ( `` mucinase activity '' ) airway , act break mucin facilitate clearance . We hypothesize glycosidases function mucinases remove peripheral monosaccharide oligosaccharide , include oligosaccharide mucin . Removal terminal capping sugar mucin side chain may important mechanism mucin degradation clearance lung . If mucinase activity exist airway mucus collect human subject demonstrate evidence mucin degradation ex vivo , especially 37º celsius . As part protocol propose examine change airway mucus ex vivo different experimental condition . Our primary readout measure sputum rheology , namely viscosity elasticity . Our consultant methodology Dr Susan Muller ( Chemical Engineering , University California , Berkeley ) . In order conduct experimental study way need multiple sample subject . Thus , 10 sputum sample per subject collect different day . In addition , interested biochemical property sputum saliva , specifically composition mucin molecule find fluid .</detailed_description>
