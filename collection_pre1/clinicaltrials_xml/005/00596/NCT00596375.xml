	<detailed_description>In Emergency Departments ( ED ) across nation renew interest find way alleviate pain discomfort associate many procedure child must undergo . Children 's memory reaction negative experience care medical professional lead many change procedural pain management ( 4 ) . One noxious procedure continue perform ED without use anesthetic agent urethral catheterization ( 11 ) . In policy American Academy Pediatrics , nationally recognize advocate child , physician urge advocate child-specific research pain management effective use pain medication ensure compassionate competent management pain . ( AAP Statement , 2001 ) Pediatric urethral catheterization one procedure child experience significant pain . ( 11 ) The Children 's Healthcare Atlanta ( CHOA ) ED Egleston perform average great 150 pediatric urethral catheterization per month . This procedure perform case child 6 month age present unexplained fever . Also , divisional guideline call urethral catheterization urinanalysis urine culture uncircumcised boy age 1 girl age 2 present unexplained temperature 39.5 degree . In previous Friends fund clinical trial , ED investigator study sucrose use child 2 month age show decrease urethral catheterization discomfort . As , become routine care ED . ( REF ; review sucrose pediatric pain , see 6 ) In present care , child 2 month age routinely receive intervention urethral catheterization relate anxiety pain , , anecdotal report suggest require physical restraint complete procedure . Lidocaine anesthetic agent provide relief pain many commonly perform ED procedure . Examples present Lidocaine use ED laceration repair , abscess drainage , lumbar puncture . Given anxiety , discomfort , pain associated urethral catheterization ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) , Lidocaine begin use clinically arena . Intraurethral Lidocaine show decrease pain associate urethral catheter placement cystograms , however , Lidocaine routinely use catheter placement obtain urine CHOA ED . Recently , two specific study perform investigate use Lidocaine decrease discomfort associate urethral catheterization . The first publish study support use intraurethral Lidocaine catheterization . ( 5 ) In investigation , Lidocaine repeatedly instill urethra ten 4- 11-year-old patient approximately 10 minute prior schedule cystogram . Patients study indicate significantly less pain Lidocaine lubricant compare receive sterile lubricant jelly . However , placement catheter cystogram require catheter place duration procedure ( 10 15 minute ) ; whereas catheterization ED urinalysis urine culture require catheter placement much short period time . The second study , compare Lidocaine lubricant jelly use topical anesthetic prior catheterization , find preverbal patient experienced discomfort without Lidocaine evaluate use Face-Legs-Activity-Cry-Consolability ( FLACC ) scoring . ( 11 ) Authors attempt investigate Lidocaine topically place urethral meatus provide relief . Although investigator achieve goal pain reduction use Lidocaine topically , find incidence positive urine culture similar Lidocaine placebo group . Using strengths previously publish study , study use Lidocaine topically instill urethra . Medical care professional increase attention pain comfort measure child undergo painful procedure ED . Pediatric urethral catheterization one area remain unaddressed . The use Lidocaine anesthetic common ED procedure well know . Investigation Lidocaine use anesthetic lubricant report twice previously pediatric literature contradict result . After critical appraisal study , investigator conclude additional investigation warrant follow characteristic : Lidocaine place topically instilled urethra ; Lidocaine compare routine care placebo ; methodology include blinded observation ; methodology evaluate pain response utilize numerous validated tool ; urine monitor evaluate biological effect Lidocaine urine culture result . Investigators aim demonstrate Lidocaine use lubricant anesthetic urethral catheterization provide safe , time-efficient , relatively easy way decrease pediatric pain emergency department setting . Specific Aims &amp; Hypotheses SA1 : To study potential use Lidocaine anesthetic agent urethral catheterization child present Pediatric Emergency Department . H1 : The use Lidocaine jelly lubricant urethral catheterization pediatric ED patient significantly decrease distress associate procedure . SA2 : To determine average Lidocaine concentration present urine obtain Lidocaine jelly use lubricant urinary catheterization . H2 : Urine Lidocaine concentration associate routine urethral catheterization utilize intraurethral Lidocaine installation approach know bacterial growth-limiting level .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Febrile patient age 2 month 2 year receive urethral catheterization obtain sterile urine microbiologic chemistry test eligible participate . Our study limit child present fever secondary unknown source , ED triage protocol require administration nonsteroidal analgesic treat fever . The physician determines patient need immediate treatment catheterization Patients history genitourinary abnormality Patients previous catheterization Primary caregiver limit English proficiency Patients history genitourinary abnormality Patients history prior catheterization exclude enrollment</criteria>
