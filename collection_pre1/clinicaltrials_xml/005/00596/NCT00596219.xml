	<brief_summary>The purpose study well understand use celecoxib , popular drug widely use arthritis , head neck cancer patient . Some doctor believe celecoxib may helpful effect use head neck cancer . Celecoxib show prevent cancer animal . It also use make standard chemotherapy radiation work well animal human . However , previous study focus tumor outside head neck region . To good understand use celecoxib head neck cancer patient , doctor MSKCC study effect drug certain chemical body think important cancer treatment . This study aim measure celecoxib affect chemical , find tumor , blood , urine patient head neck cancer . Although celecoxib already use treat arthritis , study first test drug head neck cancer patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Effects Short-Term Celecoxib Treatment Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The selective cyclo-oxygenase 2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitor , celecoxib ( Celebrex , Pfizer Inc. ) , investigated anticancer agent chemoprevention adjuvant therapeutic regimen many organ system include head neck , lung , colon , breast bladder . The mechanisms action fully define , date , data regard shortterm molecular effect celecoxib treatment human tumor tissue . These data important understanding target effect COX-2 inhibitor cancer . Specifically , pilot study seek evaluate feasibility determine whether celecoxib treatment inhibit COX-2 expression , alters intratumor eicosanoid profile , and/or suppress marker proliferation growth human tumor tissue . In addition , trial aim evaluate feasibility reliably measure effect celecoxib treatment biomarkers angiogenesis , prostaglandin metabolism select growth factor . The study title : `` Molecular effect short-term celecoxib treatment head neck squamous carcinoma . '' In study , 10 patient identify Head Neck Surgical Oncology clinic MSKCC untreated squamous cell carcinoma oral cavity oropharynx recruit participate . Participation change standard cancer care patient receive . At initial office evaluation tumor biopsied . Blood urine also collect . Patients take oral celecoxib ( 400 mg ) twice daily start exactly 5 day prior stag examination anesthesia definitive resection include morning surgery . The tumor re-biopsied time stag examination anesthesia surgical resection . Blood urine similarly re-collected time .</detailed_description>
