	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether daily consumption decaffeinate green tea catechin ( Polyphenon E® ) 1 year reduces rate progression prostate cancer ( PCa ) men diagnose HGPIN ASAP . The aim recruit treat 240 ( 120 men/arm ) men diagnose prostate condition HGPIN ASAP capsule form standardize green tea extract call Polyphenon E placebo 12-month period see prevent progression prostate condition prostate cancer . Investigators want see Polyphenon E reduce low urinary tract symptom take safely one year . Investigators want study Polyphenon E able slow progression prostate cancer , mechanism action Polyphenon E. If safety effect Polyphenon E slow progression prostate cancer show study , safe way treat men high risk men like prostate condition increase chance get prostate cancer , prevent prostate cancer future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Polyphenon E Men With High-grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At baseline/randomization visit , QOL ( Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 ) low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) score assessment complete ; urine serum collect measurement diagnostic marker ; plasma collect measurement baseline catechin level ; serum collect banking ; diet recall form collect . Participants equally randomize blind treatment either Polyphenon E 200 mg EGCG bid match placebo , initial supply study drug dispense . All participant also provide standard multivitamin/mineral supplement assure consistent , appropriate nutrient intake among study participant . The planned intervention period 12 month ; participant return monthly clinic visit intervention period . At monthly clinic visit , blood drawn repeat hepatic function panel , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time ( PT/PTT ) , participant interview review capture information study agent intake log ( pill count ) , assess sign symptom concomitant medication ; additional study medication dispense need . After 3 6 month intervention , blood drawn serum chemistry hematology , LUTS QOL assessment perform . In addition , 6 month visit , two-day diet recall form collect , blood drawn plasma catechin measurement serum banking , serum urine collect diagnostic marker measurement , repeat digital rectal exam ( DRE ) prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) perform . If palpable prostate nodule confirm PSA increase ( &gt; 0.75 ng/ml ) 6 month , repeat biopsy perform . If 6-month biopsy show evidence disease progression , participant stop intervention proceed post-intervention assessment ; otherwise , intervention continue month 12 . At end intervention ( maximum 12 month ) , repeat prostate biopsy perform post-intervention endpoint measurement . In addition , physical exam DRE , LUTS QOL repeat , 2-day diet recall form collect . Blood drawn serum chemistry hematology , PSA , hepatic function panel , LDH , PT/PTT ; serum urine collect diagnostic marker measurement ; plasma collect catechin measurement ; serum collect banking . Participants interview review capture information study agent intake log ( pill count ) , assess sign symptom concomitant medication .</detailed_description>

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychological , familial , sociological concomitant condition would allow adequate compliance study protocol History medical condition may predispose participant gastrointestinal bleeding ( acute chronic gastritis colitis , acute diverticulitis hemorrhoid ) Members race ethnic group eligible trial . Since investigation target men HGPIN ASAP , woman eligible study .</criteria>
