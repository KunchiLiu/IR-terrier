	<brief_title>Mechanisms Glucose Lowering Effect Colesevelam HCl</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colesevelam HCl ( market U.S. WelChol® ) non-absorbed polymer bind bile acid intestine , impede reabsorption , indicate low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) subject hypercholesterolemia . As bile acid pool becomes deplete , hepatic enzyme cholesterol 7- ( alpha ) -hydroxylase upregulated , increase conversion cholesterol bile acid . This cause increased demand cholesterol liver , result dual effect increase transcription activity cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme , hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A ( HMG CoA ) reductase , increase number hepatic low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptor . These compensatory effect increase clearance LDL-C blood , decrease serum LDL C level ( 1 ; 2 ) . Recently , show colesevelam HCl also improve glycemic control subject T2DM control adequately metformin , sulfonylurea combination two drug ( 3 ) . The mechanism action glucose lower know . Improved glycemic control colesevelam HCl treatment could due several mechanism . Colesevelam HCl could reduce hepatic insulin resistance lead decrease hepatic glucose production ( HGP ) . The observation Schwartz et al ( 4 ) significantly reduce fast plasma glucose concentration colesevelam-treated T2DM patient suggest reduction HGP , fast hyperglycemia direct function HGP . Colesevelam HCl could also decrease post-prandial glucose absorption . Changes glucose absorption bile acid sequestrants ( BAS ) ( 5 ) bile acid ( 6 ) report . With regard molecular mediator colesevelam effect glucose metabolism , considerable evidence emerge role bile acid nuclear transcription factor , farnesyl X receptor ( FXR ) , regulation glucose lipid metabolism ( 7 ) ( 8 ) ( 9-15 ) . Changes cellular lipid nuclear hormone receptor might directly alter HGP although mechanism lead change hepatic lipid glucose metabolism colesevelam HCl previously investigate . Significant change cholesterol bile acid synthesis rate expect colesevelam treatment . BAS treatment alter transhepatic flux compositional profile circulate bile acid pool ( 16 ) , thus hydrophobicity , may effect activation nuclear receptor , include FXR ( 17 ; 18 ) . Determination effect colesevelam treatment bile acid synthesis may provide evidence metabolic effect . The effect hepatic fatty acid synthesis ( de novo lipogenesis DNL ) investigate may provide evidence metabolic effect colesevelam . Specific hypotheses mode action test , focus hepatic glucose metabolism intestinal glucose absorption .</detailed_description>
