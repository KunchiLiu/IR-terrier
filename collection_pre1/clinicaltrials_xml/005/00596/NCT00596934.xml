	<brief_summary>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) know caused deposition fat liver development scar . This condition occur frequently overweight obese person . It often associate resistance action insulin hormone . Fat cell secrete hormone call leptin . Recently , learn obese overweight person make much leptin , may contribute insulin resistance . Paradoxically , patient fat cell , also insulin resistance . In patient , insulin resistance cause absence leptin leptin replacement significantly improve insulin resistance fat deposition liver . In early study , determine leptin level patient NASH level relate body fat level well responsiveness insulin . We saw subgroup patient NASH relatively low level leptin contrast amount body fat . We would like see restore leptin level normal improve disease process patient . Our study patient male patient , age 18 65 ( inclusive ) , cause liver disease . We put restriction body size spectrum patient normal weight obese range would include . They also demonstrate low leptin level ( level similar 25 % normal population ) . We use genetically engineer form leptin manufacture Amylin Inc. give via injection skin . We plan continue therapy period one year evaluate change liver disease liver biopsy . We also follow metabolic parameter body composition characteristic examine earlier study . We expect patient low blood leptin level show improvement liver disease insulin resistance blood leptin level restore normal .</brief_summary>
