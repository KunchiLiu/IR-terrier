	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether motivational enhancement therapy ( MET ) reduce alcohol use population HCV-infected veteran currently drink alcohol alcohol disorder . We hypothesize veteran HCV , alcohol use disorder continue excessive alcohol use receive MET great reduction number standard alcohol drink per week great percentage day abstinent veteran receive health education control intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Recent study suggest presence hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) among veteran treat within Veterans Affairs Medical Center 3 4 time common among general population approximately 50 60 % patient risk progression end-stage liver disease . Alcohol use substantially increase rate liver disease progression . Alcohol treatment base motivational principle find effective alcohol treatment seek individual low level psychiatric comorbidity . Effective treatment alcohol use studied patient chronically infected HCV , individual typically seek separate specialty care alcohol problem . The primary purpose study determine efficacy motivational enhancement therapy ( MET ) reduce alcohol use population HCV-infected veteran currently drink alcohol alcohol disorder . Secondarily study design determine whether change motivation predict change alcohol use ; determine whether MET effect non-alcohol related behavior adherence clinic appointment effect reduction alcohol use biomarkers alcohol use HCV viral load . METHODS : Two site national VA Hepatitis C Resource Center , include Minneapolis Portland enroll 136 men , woman , minority veteran HCV positive , alcohol use disorder currently drink . Participants recruit hepatitis clinic site receive two session care hepatitis clinician . Subjects eligible enrollment study drink least 7 drink per week precede 2-weeks . Participants randomly assign one two group : 4-week session MET 4 session health education control intervention . Follow-up data collect 3 6 month interview blind interviewer assess current alcohol use . Secondary outcome include stage change , data regard enrollment attendance separate substance abuse treatment self-help program ( Alcoholics Anonymous ) collect participant ' medical record . HCV viral titer obtain baseline 6-months . Percent CDT ethyl glucuronide measure confirm self-reported alcohol use study visit . The primary outcome ( efficacy MET reduce alcohol use ) data analyze use mixed effect model data normally distribute generalize estimated equation data non-normally distribute . CLINICAL RELEVANCE : This study focus current VHA priority : treatment veteran HCV . Alcohol use population major risk factor progression liver disease . We anticipate MET propose study result slow progression liver disease , improvement physical health , reduction long-term service utilization mortality rate . POTENTIAL IMPACT ON VETERANS HEALTH CARE : Effectively address alcohol use disorder hepatitis clinic contribute new standard care HCV patient within VA. MET relatively brief , easily adaptable intervention effective likely improve access alcohol treatment , acceptance patient improve clinical efficiency . In addition , reduce eliminate alcohol use population potential alter course liver disease progression , reduce rate cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma need liver transplantation .</detailed_description>
