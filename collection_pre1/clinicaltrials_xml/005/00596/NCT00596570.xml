	<brief_summary>Treatment patient suffer atrial fibrillation pose problem percutaneous coronary intervention stent implantation ( PCI-S ) perform . In absence solid evidence-based data , definite recommendation management patient subset currently give guideline percutaneous coronary intervention issue prominent Cardiology Associations . The management antithrombotic treatment invasive cardiac procedure also incompletely define . In study aim determine patient atrial fibrillation undergo PCI-S : 1. contemporary antithrombotic management ; 2. relative safety efficacy various post-PCI antithrombotic regimen ; 3. safety efficacy drug-eluting stent ( DES ) , bare-metal stent ( BMS ) , bioactive stent ( BAS ) ; 4. safety various periprocedural antithrombotic strategy include glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor bivalirudin ; 5. safety efficacy radial v femoral approach .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AFCAS study observational , multi-center , prospective registry include patient atrial fibrillation undergo PCI-S . Follow-up time 12 month . Primary end point major hemorrhagic thrombotic/thromboembolic complication include cardiac death secondary endpoint Major adverse cardiac event ( i.e. , need urgent re-revascularization , myocardial infarction , death ) , stent thrombosis major/non major hemorrhagic complication . Clinical follow-up complete patient via telephone , clinic visit schedule 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month PCI-S . The 1 6 month visit optional . The patient ask clinical outcome , hospitalization medication . Any additional information need , specific mortality , obtain contact one patient 's physician health care professional death certificate . CRFs complete faxed without delay discharge , follow visit . Recruitment take approximately 12 month . Follow-up 12 month patient .</detailed_description>
