	<brief_summary>The objective project determine whether acamprosate effective providing relief tinnitus placebo . Acamprosate suggest effective reduce tinnitus annoyance preliminary study . Study evidence indicate tinnitus relate increased excitatory spontaneous brain activity . Acamprosate may help restore excitatory/inhibitory balance brain thus reduce tinnitus . The current study include three phase . The first phase open-label screening study use identify tinnitus subject respond acamprosate . These respond subject enter second phase , double blind , placebo-controlled study aim confirm subject ' response acamprosate . In third phase , clinical parameter responder non-responders compare use multi-linear regression model determine characteristic define sub-group tinnitus patient likely benefit acamprosate treatment . Participation study require individual come Portland , Oregon least 6 time 16 month evaluation data collection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current study include three phase . The first phase open-label screening study use identify tinnitus subject respond acamprosate . These respond subject enter second phase , double blind , placebo-controlled study aim confirm subject ' response acamprosate . In third phase , clinical parameter responder non-responders compare use multi-linear regression model determine characteristic define sub-group tinnitus patient likely benefit acamprosate treatment . Participation study require individual come Portland , Oregon least 6 time 16 month evaluation data collection . Measurements : Subjects bring baseline evaluation Phase II four week finish course acamprosate Phase I . Subjects receive full audiometric evaluation . Subjects active otologic disease time excuse . Tinnitus pitch loudness match per Johnson Goodwin , ( 1981 ) perform note octave confusion . Loudness match perform use 1 kHz tone present ear contralateral tinnitus interest minimize complication tinnitus often high level test ( beyond limit equipment ) . This problem occur less often use 1 kHz comparison tone subject reasonable auditory threshold frequency . Minimum masking level ( MML ) determine measure level 2 kHz 12 kHz band noise completely masks tinnitus ipsilateral ear . Residual inhibition post-masking change test conducted end tinnitus test . The 2 kHz 12 kHz band noise elevate 10 dB MML ( tolerable ) remain continuously ear ipsilateral tinnitus 60 second . At point , mask turn subject ask identify change perceive tinnitus . If partial complete residual inhibition occur , duration time stopwatch record . Subjects also instruct complete VAS score tinnitus loudness annoyance , Tinnitus Handicap Inventory ( THI ; Newman et al , 1996 ) 25-item questionnaire currently widely use estimator impact tinnitus individual daily life , Maudsley Obsessional-Compulsive Inventory ( MOCI ; Rachman Hodgson , 1980 ) questionnaire , use primary outcome measurement , use multiple linear regression analysis Phase III . Upon complete Phase II study , subject experience improvement tinnitus acamprosate give information tinnitus management option give opportunity evaluate manage OHSU Tinnitus Clinic . The primary outcome measure Phase II include : Rated tinnitus loudness : VAS score tinnitus loudness Rated tinnitus loudness : VAS score tinnitus annoyance Tinnitus Severity : Tinnitus Handicap Index Matched tinnitus loudness : Loudness match : 1kHz tone contralateral ear tinnitus ( unless subject bilateral unilateral profound hearing loss ) Minimum Masking Level : MML broad band noise ipsilateral ear tinnitus ( unless subject bilateral unilateral profound hearing loss ) The Prototype 2 Tinnitus Functional Index 30-question evaluation tool currently development funding Tinnitus Research Consortium multi-center study host OHRC . The TFI serve secondary outcome measure tinnitus severity Phases II III . Thus far development , TFI demonstrate good reliability , validity high sensitivity measure treatment-related change tinnitus severity ( responsiveness ) . The TFI publish , investigator believe would beneficial study provide opportunity use TFI new clinical setting . The primary outcome measure MOCI TFI record five time study : At baseline visit ( Figure 1 , begin period 3 ) , end first 24 week ( period 3 4 ) , end wash period ( period 4 5 ) , end second 24-week period ( end period 5 ) 4 week completion Phase I trial . All audiometric tinnitus measure questionnaire score enter PATS data base . Short-term vs. long-term measure : Tinnitus loudness match MML measure provide quantitative measure immediate status subject 's tinnitus . Loudness annoyance integrative , depend subject 's perception tinnitus , still reflective immediate tinnitus condition subject . THI TFI quantify direct indirect impact tinnitus individual . These tool evaluate tinnitus effect often cumulative long period time ( e.g . depression , insomnia , change social interaction ) . Medications alter brain chemistry may impact either short long-term tinnitus measure category evaluate . Treatment : Subjects randomly assign Group 1 ( A/B ) Group 2 ( B/A ) completion Phase I subsequent washout period ( Figure 1 , period 1 2 ) . Group 1 receive acamprosate ( Campral ) dose 666 mg. three time daily 24 week follow 4-week washout period take matched placebo next 24 week . Group 2 receive placebo 24 week follow washout 24 week acamprosate trial . The experiment double-blinded . The subject know could take either placebo acamprosate . To insure subject blind intervention , Campral place identical capsule use cellulose placebo produce study . Data acquisition : VAS sheet complete initial Phase II baseline visit 6 set time/dated sheet ( one loudness , one annoyance , plus two spare sheet ) send home subject . Equivalent set THI , TFI MOCI include VAS sheet subject give instruction ( verbally write ) complete return data sheet self-addressed stamp envelope . Sheet acquisition follow course Phase I , however , collect monthly instead weekly . The subject return clinic 24 week test include VAS , THI , TFI MOCI evaluation . At time receive supply capsule ( medication placebo ) new set VAS , THI MOCI sheet mail envelope second period Phase II ( Figure 1 , period 5 ) . Psychoacoustic measure tinnitus measure baseline visit , 24-week return visit , conclusion 52-week study .</detailed_description>
