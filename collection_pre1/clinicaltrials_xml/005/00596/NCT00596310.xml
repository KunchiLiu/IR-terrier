	<brief_summary>Lung cancer number one cancer killer Kentucky high incidence within 5th Congressional District Kentucky ( 110.8 case per 100,000 period 1996-2000 ) . Surgical removal provide best chance cure . Unfortunately , majority lung cancer case detect advanced stage , surgical resection impossible . This lead short survival rate increase mortality rate lung cancer , increase patient suffering , great cost healthcare system . Methods favor early detection therefore crucial successful treatment . One method , low-dose spiral compute tomography ( CT ) study determine whether use screen method lead early detection earlier intervention , perhaps impact survival mortality lung cancer . This method modest sensitivity detect lung cancer , low specificity , lead many false positive low negative predictive value . The present study design address limitation : 1 ) identifying individual population high risk develop lung cancer ( due smoking habit decrease pulmonary function ) subsequent CT screening , 2 ) perform biomarker test conjunction CT scan improve ability discern individual benign lung nodule malignant tumor . The 5th Congressional District Kentucky one high rate lung cancer nation ideal location test validity ( sensitivity specificity ) , feasibility ( negative positive predictive value ) , efficacy ( stage distribution shift earlier stage disease , increase survival , decrease cancer-specific mortality ) strategies enhance early detection .</brief_summary>
