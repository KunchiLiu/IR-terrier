	<brief_title>FMRI Study Brain Response Before After Lithium Treatment People With Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar disorder ( BD ) chronic brain disorder cause dramatic change person 's mood energy . People BD undergo period extreme happiness extreme sadness , know episode mania depression . A person undergoing episode mania often experience euphoric mood , increase energy , aggressive behavior , person depressed state often experience low mood , lack energy , feeling sadness . Researchers recently discover abnormality certain brain area control emotion often present BD . It believe severe mood shift BD may cause alteration normal brain activity , specifically corticolimbic activation connectivity . Current mood stabilize medication use treat people BD may help normalize brain activity abnormality . This study assess effect BD brain activity use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) determine treatment lithium change brain activity people BD . This 9-week study include participant healthy , BD , sibling subject BD . All potential participant undergo initial testing , include physical examination , blood test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . Participants also ask answer question mental health , drug use , personality , family history , psychological well-being . Eligible participant return different day undergo MRI scan , take 4 hour complete . During scan , participant ask perform task design show change blood flow specific brain region . These task include listen sound look various letter , word , picture . This mark completion study healthy participant , first degree relative , participant BD wish receive medication treatment . Following first MRI scan , participant BD wish undergo medication treatment begin 8-week course lithium . Participants ask come clinic least week medication monitoring visit . During visit , participant undergo blood draw assessment depression mania . Participants return two repeat MRI scan Weeks 2 8 lithium treatment .</detailed_description>
