	<brief_summary>The use acetylsalicylic acid primary prevention cardiovascular event extensively study . However , overall risk level study population low ( &lt; 10 % 10-year CHD risk ) . The current study design prove efficacy tolerability 100 mg enteric-coated Aspirin versus placebo prevention cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) event , include fatal nonfatal myocardial infarction , fatal nonfatal stroke CV death , population history know CVD moderate risk major CHD event ( approximately 10-20 % 10 year CHD risk ) . This correspond patient population mean 10-year CVD risk approximately 30 % . Subjects treat standard care set may receive treatment underlie risk factor define treat physician . Outcome event adjudicate Endpoint Adjudication Committee study monitor independent Data Safety Monitoring Board .</brief_summary>
