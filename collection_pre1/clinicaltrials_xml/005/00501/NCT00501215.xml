	<brief_summary>Primary hyperparathyroidism ( PHPT ) endocrine disorder disrupts calcium metabolism broad range clinical manifestation . With respect nonclassic , subjective symptom report associated PHPT , sleep disturbance , neurocognitive dysfunction , mood disturbance , fatigue , decrease quality life , lack objective data extent symptom affect parathyroidectomy . There report improvement sleep patient follow parathyroidectomy , base solely subjective sleep survey . To date , publish study objective sleep evaluation patient PHPT . The overall goal protocol ascertain feasibility perform sleep study patient PHPT , obtain pilot data effect parathyroidectomy sleep study . It hypothesize feasible evaluate sleep parameter patient PHPT M. D. Anderson Sleep Center . Towards test hypothesis , specific aim : Specific Aim 1 : To assess feasibility use nocturnal polysomnography ( PSG ) evaluate primary outcome measure total sleep time . Specific Aim 2 : To assess feasibility use nocturnal polysomnography ( PSG ) evaluate secondary outcome measure sleep architecture , arousal index , sleep efficiency , wake sleep onset , sleep onset latency patient PHPT . Specific Aim 3 : To assess feasibility evaluate secondary outcome measure subjective sleepiness test Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) , sleep quality test Brief Sleep Disturbance Scale ( BSDS ) patient PHPT . Specific Aim 4 : To assess feasibility use randomize `` wait-list '' -control design assess effect parathyroidectomy sleep measure obtain nocturnal PSG .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening Test : To eligible take part study , woman able child must negative blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study agree take part , randomly assign ( toss coin ) 1 2 group . There equal chance assign either group . One group ( 'Surgical ' Group ) receive parathyroid surgery `` observation '' ( review blood test study doctor ) course study . The group ( 'Observation ' Group ) receive observation alone , surgery study participation end . All participant 2 overnight sleep test ( call `` polysomnograms '' -- PSGs ) telephone interview sleep quality . The Surgical Group first PSG , 1-3 week later surgery telephone interview perform . ( For surgery , separate inform consent form sign describe procedure detail . ) About 6-8 week surgery , second PSG perform . The Observation Group first PSG , telephone interview 1-3 week later . At 6-8 week interview , second PSG perform . The Observation Group participant offer parathyroid surgery soon complete second PSG ( 7-11 week participation study ) . Sleep Quality Interview : For telephone interview , research staff member call home ask discuss 6 question quality sleep . It take 15-20 minute . Polysomnography : A PSG standard test evaluate sleep . However , patient PHPT routinely receive PSGs part standard care . PSGs use many measurement make participant asleep . Sensors body record information person 's sleep stage , body position , blood oxygen level , breathing , muscle tone , heart rate , snoring , general sleep behavior . Electroencephalogram ( EEG ) sensor place scalp face order measure 'stage ' sleep . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) sensor place chest monitor heartbeat . A small probe rest inside nostril order measure breathe airflow . A snoring sensor tap neck . Elastic strap place around chest abdomen ( midsection ) , measure breathe effort . Sensors place shin order measure leg movement . A sensor tap onto fingertip order measure blood oxygen level . Audio video recording make sleep order monitor body position record sleep disturbance and/or restless movement may occur . For PSGs , arrive M. D. Anderson Sleep Center 7:30 p.m. You complete questionnaire sleep night activity day . You also complete questionnaire ask 'dozing ' habit may . It take 10-15 minute complete 2 questionnaire . You take sleep room , quiet darken . A registered PSG technologist place sensor body . You allow sleep usual wake-up time , note sleep diary . Soon wake , sensor remove . You complete third questionnaire night 's sleep . This last questionnaire take 5-10 minute complete . You able leave shortly complete questionnaire . If normal sleep day , study staff arrange sleep study happen around usual sleeping wake time . Sleep Diaries : For 7 day PSG , complete sleep diary . In diary , record information quality amount sleep . You bring sleep diary Sleep Center day PSGs . Biomarker Testing : Blood ( 4 teaspoon time ) drawn earlier day PSG , PSG perform . This blood use measure certain biomarkers compare result PSGs questionnaires . These biomarkers include level calcium , parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , vitamin D blood . Possible Crossover Surgical Group : If Observation Group blood test show high calcium level , offer parathyroid surgery soon reasonably possible . Also , Observation Group start experience worsen symptom may mean kidney stone ( abdominal pain and/or blood urine ) inflammation pancreas ( abdominal pain , nausea , vomit , fever , and/or chill ) , condition evaluate treat . You offer parathyroid surgery soon reasonably possible . At 6-8 week parathyroid surgery , second PSG . Sleep Test Results : You able receive copy PSG result . If result show sleep disorder and/or medical disorder , refer standard treatment . The result PSG affect PHPT treatment way . Length Study : After second PSG , participation study . This investigational study . Using PSGs purpose patient PHPT consider experimental . Up 12 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
