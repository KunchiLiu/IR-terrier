	<detailed_description>Invasive aspergillosis ( IA ) , particularly invasive pulmonary aspergillosis ( IPA ) , important cause morbidity mortality patient receive chemotherapy acute leukemia ( AL ) , common invasive mycosis develop patient . Proven invasive aspergillosis report 6,5 % patient acute leukemia retrospective multicenter study ( Pagano , Haematologica 2001 ) frequency may underestimate , since definite diagnosis difficult obtain , particularly leukemic patient . When recently develop , internationally recognize IFIGC/MSG/EORTC diagnostic criterion retrospectively apply consecutive series acute leukemia patient , overall frequency IPA 25,3 % ( proven/probable 8,5 % ; possible 16,9 % ) . Criteria diagnosis IPA fulfil 62,8 % pulmonary infiltrates develop AL patient ( proven/probable 17,1 % ; possible 45,7 % ) . IPA develop AML ALL patient . Proven/probable IPA develop 83 % case first induction cycle ( Borlenghi , EHA 2003 ) . It may estimate figure would high patient would follow prospectively strictly monitor , particularly GM antigenemia . The mechanisms common colonize agent like Aspergillus spp . become invasive pathogen cause severe tissue damage partially know . Recent experimental data animal model raise hypothesis long pentraxin Ptx3 may play important role resistance select microbial agent , particular Aspergillus fumigatus ( Garlanda , Nature 2002 ) . Caspofungin echinocandin potent antifungal activity Aspergillus specie . Its mechanism action differs antifungal agent use far , like amphotericin azoles . It proven effective well tolerate use therefore currently approve salvage treatment patient invasive aspergillosis refractory amphotericin , well empiric treatment febrile neutropenia . Indeed recently evaluate empirical treatment neutropenic patient persistent fever unknown origin prove equally effective well tolerate liposomal amphotericin . There yet data use caspofungin primary prophylaxis patient acute leukaemia , set lack effective preventive treatment together generally favourable safety profile efficacy caspofungin make particularly attractive investigation . It hypothesize data administration caspofungin prophylactic treatment invasive aspergillosis safe well tolerated patient undergo chemotherapy acute leukemia diagnosis . It may reduce high incidence invasive pulmonary aspergillosis characteristically develop first course induction treatment , avoid direct morbidity mortality IPA negative impact treatment prognosis AL well cost IPA diagnosis treatment . The serum level long pentraxin Ptx3 may interpatient variability may correlate subsequent development invasive aspergillosis . These fact lead present multicenter , phase II , single arm , open study , perform Northern Italy Leukemia Group . There approximately 12 participate center , enroll total 100 patient . Patients receive caspofungin , start first day induction chemotherapy leukemia , single daily dose intravenously dosage 70 mg q.d . follow 50 mg q.d . thereafter documentation complete hematologic remission first induction cycle leukemia persistence one cycle induction one cycle salvage chemotherapy . No stratification plan . Patients concurrently receive medication need treatment acute leukemia , accord ongoing protocol NILG acute leukemia diagnosis . The study period continue The treatment stop presence follow condition : - Development severe adverse event grade 3-4 toxicity attributable caspofungin - Development proven/probable IPA No caspofungin dose reduction plan . The dose caspofungin adjust patient weight 80 kg patient take rifampin liver enzymes-inducing drug .</detailed_description>
