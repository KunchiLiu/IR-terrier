	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify clinical genetic marker ovarian age . In process , evaluate environmental factor may affect fertility age fertility decline , may influence age woman enter menopause . Wide variability exist woman age menopause occur rate decline oocyte number reproductive capability . As loss ovarian function profound impact woman 's hormonal milieu subsequent risk development disease , improve understanding factor determine time rate reproductive age critical improving quality life woman . In addition , improve understanding reproductive age profound economic , social , implication give complex choice woman face regard time childbearing grow burden infertility . While inter-individual variability age menopause large genetic component possible environmental influence , date study address relationship oocyte number reflect antral follicle count ( AFC ) genetic inheritance . We hypothesize ovarian aging , reflect antral follicle count , largely determined common genetic polymorphism impact initial oocyte endowment and/or rate oocyte loss time thus lower antral follicle count give age . We hypothesize antral follicle count improve marker ovarian age . Thus , propose study genetic environmental factor influence age-specific variability antral follicle count .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This cross-sectional study subgroup follow longitudinally time . This study consist four basic component : - identification recruitment population-based sample 1,250 regularly cycle woman diverse ethnicity , age 25-45 ; - baseline examination day 2-4 menstrual cycle , include blood draw , transvaginal ultrasound examination , body size measurement , questionnaire , establish cross-sectional relation AFC genetic environmental exposure interest ( see Specific Aims ) ; - genetic analysis X-chromosome autosomal mutation , deletion , polymorphism , implicate control ovarian function ; - follow-up examination , 3 year baseline , complete approximately one-third cohort ( n=450 ) , begin describe longitudinal relation AFC exposures interest identify marker predictive accelerated follicle loss . Specific Aims : 1 . Characterize antral follicle count ( AFC ) marker ovarian age compare available biomarkers , FSH , FSH/LH , inhibin B , determine effect modification relationship age . 2 . Examine relationship antral follicle count frequency specific genetic polymorphism DAZL ( Deleted AZoospermia-Like ) interact protein gene . 3 . Determine association race/ethnicity , body fat , active passive smoking AFC , independently age ; main effect observe genetic polymorphism AFC ( Specific Aim 2 ) , explore effect modification relationship race/ethnicity , body fat active passive smoking . 4 . Determine change AFC three-year period relation genetic environmental characteristic , base approximately 450 woman complete 3-year follow-up examination . The primary goal study demonstrate relationship antral follicle count common genetic polymorphism effect modification environmental factor . To achieve goal , multidisciplinary team propose recruit random sample 1,250 regularly cycling , ethnically diverse woman , age 25-45 , belong Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care ( KPMC ) Program San Francisco . This study provide evidence support ultrasound evaluation non-invasive marker ovarian aging . This genetic testing may lead opportunity prospective identification patient risk early decline ovarian function . The ability accurately generate share type information allow woman become proactive managing fertility well well understand risk associate reproductive aging . The recruitment large , population-based cohort increase generalizability data generate . The ethnic diversity population allow multiple comparison identify true `` risk factor '' early , and/or accelerate , ovarian age correlation ethnicity .</detailed_description>
