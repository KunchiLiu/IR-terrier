	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : 1 . To determine whether rhG-CSF treatment increase frequency donor-derived cell contribute repair damage epithelial/endothelial solid organ-specific tissue cause graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) patient underwent sex-mismatched stem cell transplantation . Secondary Objective : 1 . To determine whether rhG-CSF treatment alleviate GVHD-induced damage epithelial/endothelial solid organ-specific tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It find cell circulate blood capable form cell line oral cavity , skin cell , and/or cell various organ . RhG-CSF used support cell recovery stem cell transplantation commercially available . Before treatment start , participant least one ( three ) biopsy ( y ) damage tissue perform find severity tissue damage . A biopsy take large needle . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . Participants study receive rhG-CSF injection skin day one week . This repeat every week total 4 week . Blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) perform 3 time M. D. Anderson week outpatient make sure white blood count stay safe range . Participants least one ( three ) biopsy ( y ) perform 8 week start rhG-CSF treatment . An additional biopsy 3 month start rhG-CSF treatment perform case regular treatment follow require , research purpose . Participants take study severe side effect occur . The study end last biopsy biopsy take , 3 month start rhG-CSF treatment . This investigational study . RhG-CSF FDA approve commercially available , though use study investigational . A maximum 5 patient treat protocol . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
