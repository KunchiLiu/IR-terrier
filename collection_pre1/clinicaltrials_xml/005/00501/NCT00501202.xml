	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus common cause neuropathy Western World , 50 % patient develop neuropathy long-term complication illness , 10 % experience pain . Diabetic neuropathy often affect low extremity may severe inadequately treat . Blood glucose control critical treatment element , several medication demonstrate effective treating Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy ( DPN ) , include antiepileptic drug , antidepressant opioid analgesic . These medication often limit incomplete pain relief side effect . This randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither Investigator patient know name assign study medication ) , placebo-controlled , crossover , parallel-group , multicenter study determine effectiveness safety 200 mg RWJ-333369 give twice daily mouth 4 week compare placebo patient DPN . The study hypothesis 200 mg RWJ-333369 give twice daily mouth 4 week effective placebo reduce pain due DPN , measure average daily DPN pain score . Patients receive 200 mg RWJ-333369 matching placebo tablet , give equally divided dos twice daily mouth without food , 4 week 2 treatment period .</detailed_description>
