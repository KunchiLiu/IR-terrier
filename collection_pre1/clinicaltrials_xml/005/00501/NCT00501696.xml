	<brief_title>A Randomized Placebo-Controlled , Crossover-Design Study Effects Low Dose Naltrexone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immunomodulatory immunosuppressive therapy know modify course disease . Interferon beta-1a , interferon beta-1b glatiramer acetate immunomodulators whereas mitoxantrone natalizumab immunosuppressants The disease modify therapy decrease frequency relapse associate improved neurological outcome relative placebo . However , medication partially effective , expensive , require either frequent self injection intravenous infusion significant side effect . None proven progressive form MS none alleviate symptom associate MS. Endogenous Opioid peptides Naltrexone : Low dose naltrexone ( LDN ) propose adjust level endorphin body thereby enhance immune function anecdotally beneficial MS. LDN inexpensive , easily administer ( one capsule day bedtime ) , virtually serious side effect ( first week LDN use , patient complain difficulty sleeping , rarely persist first week ) . Although use LDN popular within MS community efficacy proven clinical trial perform . Naltrexone , opioid antagonist approve FDA 1984 50mg dose treatment opioid alcohol abuse . By block opioid receptor , naltrexone also block reception endogenous opioid peptide : beta-endorphin , metenkephalin dynorphin . Virtually every cell immune system receptor mediator . These peptide regulate wide range biological activity , include immune response interaction G-protein couple transmembrane opioid receptor . In 1985 , Bernard Bihari , MD , describe effect low dose Naltrexone ( 1.5-4.5 mg Naltrexone ) body 's immune system . He discover people HIV less twenty percent normal level endorphin . He begin look way raise endorphin without block receptor find 1.75-4.5 mg Naltrexone ( Low Dose Naltrexone , LDN ) bed time raise endorphin level 100 300 percent night . Dr. Bihari report beneficial effect LDN variety diseases cancer ( e.g . Multiple Myeloma , Lymphoma , Hodgkin 's disease , breast cancer , GI cancer , non small cell cancer lung , malignant melanoma , neuroblastoma , ovarian cancer , prostate cancer , renal cell carcinoma , uterine cancer ) , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , Alzheimer 's disease , Behçet 's disease , celiac disease , chronic fatigue syndrome , Crohn 's disease , emphysema , fibromyalgia , HIV/AIDS , Irritable bowel syndrome , Parkinson 's disease , pemphigoid , psoriasis , multiple sclerosis , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic Lupus erythematosus , ulcerative colitis Wegner 's granulomatosis . Despite anecdotal claim publish study demonstrate efficacy LDN disease state . Because low cost ease administration anecdotal report efficacy LDN gain significant gross-roots following among patient doctor . There strike report beneficial effect LDN relapse reduction disability general patient treat LDN report improvement sense well , fatigue , well bowel , bladder sexual function . Immunological Mechanisms Involved MS effect LDN β-endorphin opioid peptide , synthesize cell central nervous system ( arcuate nucleus ) immune system ( lymphocytes , thymocytes , monocyte splenocytes ) . This peptide decrease concentration peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) MS patient , low concentration link progressive form disease . Furthermore increased concentration β-endorphin find interferon beta treatment follow clinical relapse . In animal model MS , experimental autoimmune encephalitis , β-endorphin blockade worsens disability . Lesions MS may result oligodendroglial apoptosis microglial activation rather neuroinflammatory process . Activated microglia secrete proinflammatory neurotoxic factor ( nitric oxide peroxynitrites ) could cause neurodegeneration . In theory , inhibition microglia would protective MS. Naltrexone , capable reduce microglial cytokine ( IL-1β ) nitric oxide glial culture . If naltrexone beneficial MS , possible mechanism action reduction microglial nitric oxide synthase activity result decrease peroxynitrites production . Peroxynitrites think inhibit glutamate transporter thereby increase synaptic concentration glutamate result excitatory neurotoxicity .</detailed_description>
