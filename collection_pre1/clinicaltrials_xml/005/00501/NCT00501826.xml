	<brief_title>Hyper-CVAD Plus Nelarabine Untreated T-ALL/Lymphoblastic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intensive chemotherapy ( hyper-CVAD therapy ) use study include combination 7 chemotherapy drug . These drug include Adriamycin ( doxorubicin ) , cyclophosphamide , cytarabine ( Ara-C ) , dexamethasone , methotrexate , nelarabine , vincristine . The maintenance therapy use study include combination 5 chemotherapy drug . These drug include pegaspargase , methotrexate , prednisone , 6-mercaptopurine , vincristine . Ara-C design insert DNA ( genetic material cell ) stop DNA repairing . Cyclophosphamide design interfere multiplication cancer cell , may slow stop growth spread throughout body . This may cause cancer cell die . Dexamethasone , doxorubicin , methotrexate , prednisone , 6-mercaptopurine design stop slow growth cancer cell , may cause cell die . Nelarabine design inhibit ( `` turn '' ) growth division cancer cell . Vincristine design interfere multiplication cancer cell , may slow stop growth spread throughout body . This may cause cancer cell die . If find eligible take part study , receive 2 kind intensive chemotherapy regimen ( hyper-CVAD therapy methotrexate plus Ara-C ) alternate total 8 course ( 4 course ) . One ( 1 ) course therapy 21 28 day . All chemotherapy give large vein central venous catheter . A central venous catheter sterile flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form procedure . Intensive Chemotherapy : Hyper-CVAD therapy give Courses 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . For therapy , receive cyclophosphamide vein 2-3 hour every 12 hour total 6 dos . It give 3 day ( Days 1 , 2 , 3 ) . You receive doxorubicin vein 24 hour Day 4 . The doxorubicin infusion may extend 48 hour , consider poor heart function ( provide know ) may tolerate drug well slow continuous infusion . You receive vincristine vein 15-30 minute Days 4 11 . You receive dexamethasone 1 time day mouth vein minute Days 1-4 Days 11-14 . You also receive G-CSF ( Filgrastim ) vein minute skin start 24-72 hour completion course chemotherapy white blood cell count recover ( help rapid recovery normal bone marrow ) . You may receive pegfilgrastim give one dose skin rather filgrastim . For participant 60 year old , first course chemotherapy give protective isolation room monitoring study staff help watch decrease risk infection . Methotrexate give combination Ara-C Courses 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 . You receive methotrexate vein 24 hour Day 1 . You receive Ara-C vein Days 2-3 , 2-3 hour every 12 hour total 4 dos . Doses Ara-C adjust accord level methotrexate receive . Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure study drug level . Leucovorin , use help decrease side effect methotrexate , give vein ( 15 minute ) mouth ( every 6 hour ) 2-3 day ( blood level methotrexate low enough stop leucovorin ) . Filgrastim give dose schedule Courses 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . You may receive pegfilgrastim give one dose skin rather filgrastim . During treatment , physical exam , include measurement vital sign . You blood draw ( 1 tablespoon ) least week sometimes 3 time week . After 1 2 course chemotherapy , test do screen visit repeat check disease response treatment . A bone marrow biopsy repeat start 2 week therapy . This biopsy repeat every week disease response treatment know . If leukemia lymphoma respond therapy experience intolerable side effect , continue therapy 8 course . You take study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . To decrease risk leukemia develop brain , give treatment brain injection spinal fluid methotrexate around Day 2 . Ara-C give injection spinal fluid Day 7 course . The total number treatment may 8 , mean 2 course total number treatment reach . During Courses receive nelarabine , injection spinal fluid give later ( around Days 15 22 course ) . An Ommaya reservoir may also surgically place route treat leukemia brain decrease risk leukemia brain . It would place participant difficulty spinal treatment . An Ommaya reservoir tube insert skin scalp enters spinal fluid cavity brain . After first 4 course , receive 1 course nelarabine . Nelarabine give vein 2 hour day 5 day . After 21-35 day , continue Course 5 ( Hyper-CVAD ) . After Course 5 , receive second course nelarabine dose schedule . Once course complete , continue Course 6 ( methotrexate cytarabine ) . After completion treatment , complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign . You blood draw ( 8 teaspoon ) routine test . You chest x-ray CT scan perform , need . You may bone marrow biopsy repeat . If enlarge lymph gland center chest , may receive radiation chest . If need radiation , proceed monthly maintenance chemotherapy . If require radiation ( base doctor think best ) , start maintenance chemotherapy finish radiation . Maintenance Therapy : Maintenance chemotherapy give total 30 month interrupt 2 period intensive chemotherapy course . For maintenance therapy , receive 6-mercaptopurine mouth 3 time day , methotrexate mouth week , vincristine vein month minute , prednisone mouth day 5 day row every month . The first period intensive chemotherapy course give Courses 6 7 maintenance program . For intensive chemotherapy time , receive nelarabine vein 2 hour day 5 day row 21-35 day apart . The second period intensive chemotherapy course give Courses 18 19 . It start first methotrexate vein Day 1 pegaspargase vein Day 2 . These give week 4 dos . The follow month , receive hyper-CVAD ( like Course 1 begin treatment ) . The hyper-CVAD may begin combination methotrexate pegaspargase . Intensive chemotherapy give inpatient outpatient basis ( depend study doctor think safe ) 8 intensive cycle chemotherapy . The maintenance treatment may give outpatient basis . However , circumstance ( intolerance intensive chemotherapy ) , may move intensive chemotherapy maintenance phase completion 8 cycle intensive chemotherapy without receive nelarabine . After completion therapy , return every 3-6 month checkup . You may x-ray repeat , need . If complete remission , bone marrow biopsy repeat every 4 month evaluate marrow `` minimal residual disease , '' presence absence small amount leukemia usually detect routine blood test . This investigational study . All drug use study FDA approve commercially available . Their use together study investigational use research . Up 100 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
