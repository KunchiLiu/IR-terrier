	<brief_title>Multimodality Therapy Palliative Resectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Intrahepatic Vessels Invasion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) fifth common neoplasm third cause cancer-related death . At initial diagnosis , surgical resection consider potentially curative modality HCC [ 1 , 2 ] , five-year survival rate resectable patient 50-60 % , however , 15 % patient resectable disease post-operative recurrence common , remain main obstacle long-term survival . On one hand , reason may multicentric genesis HCC preoperatively micrometastasis resect operation . Shi M , et al [ 3 ] report appropriate resection margin &gt; = 2cm . The Liver Cancer Study Group Japan ( LCSGJ ) define [ 4 ] : absolute curative resection include liver resection 1 cm free surgical margin patient solitary tumor &lt; = 2cm ; relative curative resection include liver resection without 1 cm free surgical margin excise tumor tissue patient solitary tumor &lt; = 2cm liver resection 1 cm free surgical margin patient tumor &gt; = 2cm ( either instance , tumor thrombus may remain portal vein , hepatic vein , bile duct image remnant liver ) ; relative non-curative resection , macroscopic tumor tissue remove ; absolute non-curative resection , liver resection part macroscopic tumor tissue remain . Either overall survival rate ( OS ) disease-free survival rate ( DFS ) HCC patient higher curative resection non-curative resection [ 4 ] . According definition , giant tumor locate middle liver , tumor lymph node adjacent abdominal aorta metastasis , multiple lesion ( &gt; = 3 ) tumor intrahepatic vessel invasion , surgery non-curative . On hand , post-operative adjuvant therapy one effective treatment strategy improve survival rate HCC patient [ 5 ] . Unfortunately , 15 randomize control trial report post-operative adjuvant therapy . Most single center , little sample clinical trial . Recently , series study report transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) effective HCC [ 6 , 7 ] . Best result see patient small tumor good liver function 1 year survival show 30-50 % . A recent meta-analysis show significant benefit chemo-embolization improvement two-year survival [ 6 ] . TACE one important therapy strategy HCC . The 2007 ' NCCN clinical practice guideline oncology include TACE throughout treatment guideline unresectable HCC resectable HCC ( reason , hepatectomy carry ) adjuvant therapy post-operative . But still lack RCT study . In patient palliative resectable HCC , presence intrahepatic vessel invasion usually regard symbol cancer cell hematogenous dissemination , associate short-term recurrence bad survival . For special group patient , author insist aggressive therapy strategy-initial palliative hepatectomy follow TACE and/or local regional treatment effective prolong survival patients.While author , however , believe aggressive therapy best choice patient suppression immune system palliative hepatectomy may potentially accelerate growth residual cancer cell . A relative conservative strategy-transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization combine local regional treatment without hepatectomy use . The optimal therapy strategy still controversial.Only multiple-center , great sample clinical RCT study answer question [ 8 ] . The purpose study compare effect different multimodality therapy strategy ( initial hepatectomy follow transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization and/or local regional treatment compare transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization combine local regional treatment without hepatectomy ) treatment palliative resectable hepatocellular carcinoma intrahepatic vessel invasion .</detailed_description>
