	<detailed_description>Women successfully treat endometrial cancer invite participate study . After agree participate ask question physical activity make sure eligible . You allow participate study physician feel safe engage moderate physical activity , ask complete form health condition . Information cancer treatment history collect medical record part study . If agree take part study , come M. D. Anderson study visit twice begin study . If need , activity first 2 visit combine 1 visit , though mean single visit take little long 2 visit . After first visit , ask return 2 , 4 , 6 month . Each visit take 2 hour . Three ( 3 ) month 6 month last visit , call answer question physical activity . It take 10 minute answer question . In case reach phone , questionnaires mail . You ask mail questionnaire back pre-paid address envelope . At first visit complete questionnaire quality life , medical condition , physically active currently past . The questionnaire take 45 minute complete . A baseline electrocardiogram ( ECG-a test measure electrical activity heart ) perform . If ECG test normal inform . You practice use exercise bicycle use fitness test later visit . You ask provide saliva sample place cotton roll mouth saturate place back plastic vial without use hand . This sample practice discard . You also give ActiGraph wear 5 day . This small light device wear waist day . It record active . You also give handheld computer use 5 day answer question physical activity . The computer small ( 4-1/2 3 inch ) light ( 4 1/2 ounce ) . The computer prompt enter information 8 time day . Answering question take 5 minute . You ask return Actigraph computer second visit . After 5 day , come back M. D. Anderson second study visit . During visit , ask complete questionnaire physical activity take 1 hour . You electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) perform . You perform fitness test , ride stationary bicycle heart rate , blood pressure , respiration ( breathe ) monitor . You also ask complete two task computer . After second visit , use handheld computer wear Actigraph 5 day . You also give 10 vial container bag instruction collect saliva sample . You ask provide saliva sample 5 time per day 2 consecutive day . During second visit , meet exercise physiologist , specially-trained health care professional design personalize exercise program , involve walk ( 30 minute ) day week . If walk difficult painful , another form exercise substitute . In addition receive personalized exercise program , also receive telephone counsel visit M. D. Anderson print material . Both provide information support exercise program . The telephone counsel call take place week first 2 month , every week Months 3 4 , month Months 5 6 . The phone counselor talk exercise program working . The telephone call take place time convenient , take 15-20 minute time . Some telephone counsel call may audiotaped , counselor ' supervisor make sure counsel do correctly .

This mean goal exercise set high low , often exercise occur long exercise session last change . For example , exercise physiologist first recommend walk 15 minute day 5 day week , report ca n't walk 15 minute , length walk may reduce . You also fill questionnaire task computer visit . You complete brief ( 5 minute ) program evaluation . You also ask answer question handheld computer 5 day visit . You also ask wear Actigraph 5 day visit . At last visit , also give 10 vial container bag instruction collect saliva sample . You ask provide saliva sample 5 time per day 2 consecutive day . The study staff give prepaid mail envelope return computer , Actigraph , package vial mail , last 5-day period . This investigational study . Up 326 participant enrol study . For pilot phase , complete , 22 endometrial cancer survivor 37 comparison participant history cancer enrol . For main phase study , enrol , 267 endometrial cancer survivor enrol . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
