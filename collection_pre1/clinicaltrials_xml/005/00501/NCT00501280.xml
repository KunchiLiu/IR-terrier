	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To test hypothesis child whose mother Migrant/Seasonal Farmworkers ( MSFs ) ( occupationally-exposed pesticide ) may high risk exhibit mutagen-induced DNA damage child whose mother father MSFs . 2 . To test hypothesis MSF mother ( occupationally-exposed pesticide ) may high risk exhibit mutagen-induced DNA damage mother MSFs . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To test hypothesis extent pesticide exposure type polymorphisms chemical detoxification gene DNA repair gene contribute extent cytogenetic damage find child MSF woman . 2 . To test hypothesis extent pesticide exposure type polymorphisms chemical detoxification gene DNA repair gene contribute extent cytogenetic damage find MSF mother . 3 . To test hypothesis total concentration level organochlorine ( OCP ) organophosphate ( OP ) pesticides correlate mutagenic potency serum urine child . 4 . To test hypothesis total concentration level OCP OP pesticide correlate mutagenic potency serum urine mother . 5 . To test hypothesis inherit polymorphisms PON1 gene expression modulate risk OP genotoxicity measure inhibition acetylcholinesterase enzyme MSF child . 6 . To test hypothesis inherit polymorphisms PON1 gene expression modulate risk OP genotoxicity measure inhibition acetylcholinesterase enzyme MSF mother .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants study either MSF child mother non-MSF woman ( woman never work agriculture ) child . If mother one child school system , one child participate study . A major effort study collect , store analyze blood urine sample MSF woman child group non-MSF woman child . Only MSF child match ethnicity , sex , age ( 2 year ) , place residence non-MSF child . All mother child participant recruit school roster Goose Creek Consolidated Independent School District Harris County , La Joya School District Hidalgo County .

Anderson prefer interview on-site visit . A bilingual interviewer ask child 's mother child would like participate study . The interviewer ask participate mother child 's age , child 's gender , child 's exposure chemical , medical history , place live , place work , family history disease , reproductive breast feeding history , diet , alcohol tobacco use . The interview take 60 70 minute complete mother 's child participant ' questionnaire . All interview complete telephone on-site language choice ( English Spanish ) . Two ( 2 ) member research team collect blood urine sample , transport M. D. Anderson since overnight carrier available require day collection . About 5 teaspoon blood drawn urine sample collect . In addition , height weight mother child measure . All blood urine collect used researcher involve study . If child 's mother agree , type ( ) level pesticide detect provided child 's physician diagnostic purpose . The data analyze way help maintain confidentiality . This investigational study . A total 400 child participant mother ( N=400 ) take part study . All 800 participant enrol UT MD Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
