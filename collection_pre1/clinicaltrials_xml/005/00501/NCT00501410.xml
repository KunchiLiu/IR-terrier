	<brief_summary>The goal Phase I part clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination dasatinib , cetuximab , FOLFOX ( 5-fluorouracil [ 5-FU ] , leucovorin [ LV ] , Eloxatin [ oxaliplatin ] ) give patient metastatic colorectal cancer . The safety drug combination also study . The goal Phase II part clinical research study learn dasatinib give combination FOLFOX without cetuximab help control metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FOLFOX Chemotherapy Regimen ( 5-FU , Leucovorin , Oxaliplatin ) Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cetuximab drug design block activity EGFR , protein surface tumor cell may cause cell grow . Blocking EGFR may stop slow growth tumor cell . Dasatinib drug inhibits protein call c-Src . High level c-Src may make hard chemotherapy work cancer . If dasatinib inhibit c-Src , chemotherapy may effective cancer . FOLFOX drug combination frequently use treat colon rectal cancer spread part body . FOLFOX design kill rapidly divide cell prevent DNA ( genetic material cell ) duplicate . Kirsten Rat Sarcoma ( KRAS ) Testing : Recent study find cetuximab , give alone combination chemotherapy drug , effective give patient colorectal cancer KRAS gene mutation . If take part Phase I part study , tumor tissue previous biopsy surgery use test KRAS mutation . If KRAS gene mutation , take part study . If take part Phase II part study , tumor tissue previous biopsy surgery use test KRAS mutation . If KRAS gene mutation , may take part study receive cetuximab . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group ( Phase I Phase II ) base join study . If enrolled Phase I portion , dose dasatinib receive depend join study . Three ( 3 ) 6 participant enter dose level . Each new group participant receive high dose , high tolerable dose find . Once high tolerable dose find , 12 participant enrol dose level . Your doctor tell dose level receive dose compare dose participant receive . The start dose cetuximab FOLFOX participant . The dose dasatinib increase next group 3-6 participant . Every 14 day consider 1 study `` cycle '' . If enrol Phase II portion , receive dose dasatinib find best tolerated Phase I portion . You also receive FOLFOX . If KRAS gene mutation , also receive cetuximab . Every 14 day consider 1 study `` cycle '' . Central Venous Catheter ( CVC ) Placement : Before receive study drug , CVC place . A CVC sterile flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form procedure . Study Drug Administration : You take dasatinib mouth day , every day study . Your study doctor research nurse tell many pill take . Dasatinib take time day , without meal . If miss dose dasatinib , double next dose . It important take dasatinib water , fruit juice . You drink grapefruit juice eat grapefruit study . Dasatinib touch child , pregnant woman , woman breastfeed . If caregiver must handle drug , protective glove worn . While take dasatinib , give drug diary . In diary , write date , time , number dasatinib tablet take . Certain drug herbal supplement may take receive dasatinib . These drug could affect body break dasatinib , could bad effect . Your doctor give list drug herbal supplement must take study . You must tell doctor take new drug study . On Day 1 every cycle , receive oxaliplatin LV CVC 2 hour . On Day 1 , receive 5-FU portable pump next 46 hour . If receive cetuximab Phase I portion study , receive Days 1 8 CVC 2 hour . If receive cetuximab Phase II portion study , receive Day 1 CVC 2 hour . Study Visits Phase I : If enrol high tolerable dose level , 2 core liver biopsy . The liver tissue study learn effect study drug stop protein c-Src . You 2 liver biopsy collect . The first liver biopsy collect start study drug , second perform either Cycle 2 3 . Before liver biopsy , receive fluid drug relaxation and/or pain needle arm hand . You awake biopsy . A radiologist find tumor liver help radiographic imaging procedure ultrasound CT scan . Your skin around area cleanse , local anesthetic give . A long , hollow needle insert skin liver tumor , tissue sample ( ) take . On Day 8 , blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . You extra blood sample draw ( 1 tablespoon time ) receive study drug Day 8 Cycles 2 4 . This blood drawn time routine blood test draw . These blood sample use develop test may help doctor able predict best benefit dasatinib . If enrol group receive high tolerable dose level , Day 8 blood draw cycle 2 perform . Instead , blood collect time liver biopsy perform Days 8-14 cycle 2 3 2 6 hour take daily dose dasatinib . Study Visits Phase II : You extra blood sample draw ( 1 tablespoon time ) receive study drug end every 4 cycle . This blood drawn time routine blood test draw . These blood sample use develop test may help doctor able predict best benefit dasatinib . Before start new cycle stop study treatment , ask complete questionnaire symptom may experience . The questionnaire take 5 minute complete . Once stop receiving study drug , study team contact telephone every 3 month check . Each phone call take 5 minute . Phase I Phase II : Before new cycle , ask question side effect may . At visit , important tell study staff drug currently take . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . You performance status evaluation . Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Women able become pregnant blood urine pregnancy test every month . If experience severe side effect , study drug may delay , stop , may receive small dos drug . You may remain study long benefit . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Once off-study , end-of-study visit . At visit , blood ( 3 tablespoon ) collect routine test . You ask question side effect may drug currently take . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . You performance status evaluation . If perform recently , CT scan MRI scan chest , abdomen pelvis check status disease . If side effect stop receive study drug , contact phone check feeling , follow-up visit side effect go away . This investigational study . Dasatinib FDA approve treatment leukemia . Its use study , disease , consider investigational . Cetuximab , 5-FU , LV , oxaliplatin FDA approve commercially available treatment colorectal cancer . Up 83 patient take part study . All patient enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
