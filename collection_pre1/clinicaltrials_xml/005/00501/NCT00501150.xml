	<brief_summary>The main purpose study find whether change hospital policy allow switch glycopeptide antibiotic ( give intravenous drip ) , equally effective oral antibiotic ( linezolid ) enable patient otherwise well enough discharge hospital sooner . The secondary objective 1 . To identify patient could potentially discharge oral agent treat glycopeptide , thus help target approach effectively 2 . To evaluate cost involve compare cost would take place use oral agent discharge occur .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Antibiotic Treatment Home Instead Intravenous Treatment Hospital Resistant Gram Positive Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment resistant gram positive infection remain problematic , glycopeptides remain mainstay current management . Unfortunately administer IV route , useful activity give orally infection . Thus oral flucloxacillin ampicillin use follow IV treatment management infection cause antibiotic sensitive Staphylococcus aureus enterococcal respectively , case antibiotic resistant infection whole course antibiotic usually give IV route . To extent insufficient evidence support routine use oral agent mean patient antibiotic resistant infection stay hospital longer antibiotic sensitive infection . Linezolid relatively newly available antibiotic show , setting effective glycopeptides treatment resistant gram positive infection include MRSA . Unfortunately Linezolid significantly expensive currently available agent make important evaluate cost benefit aspect use comparison similarly effective agent . Switching IV suitable oral alternative management resistant gram positive infection could potentially result significant save duration IV therapy would allow patient discharge earlier . This would provide significant cost benefit face Linezolids equal superior efficacy would justify widespread use order allow suitable patient treat home . The rationale behind study determine level implement NHS teach hospital Trust . To identify patient could potentially benefit early discharge oral therapy , implement possible compare actual effect LOS potential identify earlier cohort patient . We propose prospectively assess economic clinical impact switch IV glycopeptides oral Linezolid implementing home treatment oral therapy policy 18 month period HHT hospital Two senior infection specialist ( Medical Microbiologist , K Bamford Infectious Disease physician , A Holmes ) independently review patient together study pharmacist decide individual suitable switch oral agent and/or discharge use standardise criterion decision making . Patients study assess number attributable bed day , line use day , ward pharmacist intervention ( trigger monitoring adjust dose ) investigation medical complication accrue due IV administration follow glycopeptide prescription . The various cost Trust save IV glycopeptide switch suitable oral alternative early discharge implement calculate</detailed_description>
