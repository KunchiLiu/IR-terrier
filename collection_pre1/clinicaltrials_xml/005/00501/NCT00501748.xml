	<brief_summary>The goal research study investigate whether Rituximab safe use patient suffer NMO , high risk develop NMO . It think NMO cause immune system react optic nerve spinal cord . B cell part immune system may contribute illness . Rituximab antibody deplete B cell . Depletion B cell Rituximab may induce remission disease . Because pathological serological study suggest NMO appear , least part , B-cell mediate disease Rituximab , attractive treatment candidate disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rituximab genetically engineer , chimeric , murine/human monoclonal antibody direct CD20 antigen find surface normal malignant pre-B mature B cell . The antibody IgG1 immunoglobulin contain murine light- heavy chain variable region sequence human constant region sequence . Rituximab compose two heavy chain 451 amino acid two light chain 213 amino acid ( base cDNA analysis ) approximate molecular mass 145 kD . Rituximab bind affinity CD20 antigen ~8.0 nM . Rituximab develop Biogen Idec Genentech , Inc . It approve FDA 1997 treatment relapse refractory low grade follicular , CD20+ , B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) . Rituximab also study variety non-malignant autoimmune disorder B cell auto antibody appear play role pathophysiology . Rituximab report relieve sign symptom rheumatoid arthritis , lupus , immune thrombocytopenia , autoimmune anemia , autoimmune neuropathy , paraneoplastic opsoclonus/myoclonus . A Phase II study ( WA16291 ) complete patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . A total 161 patient randomize 4 treatment arm : Methotrexate , Rituximab alone , Rituximab Methotrexate , Rituximab Cyclophosphamide . Two dos Rituximab , 1 gm , administer IV two week apart . Infusion reaction observe 36 % patient first infusion Rituximab compare 30 % placebo . Four Rituximab-treated patient develop serious infection , rate 4.6 per 100 patient year . For context , rate infection require hospital admission 9.57 per 100 patient year community base epidemiologic study RA . We treat 8 patient NMO Rituximab observe Rituximab appear well tolerated 0/8 patient suffer serious adverse reaction could directly relate Rituximab administration . Moreover , 7/8 patient experienced decrease neurological disability follow treatment , suggest B-cell depletion may enhance neurological recovery attack . 7/8 patient remain attack-free within period 18 month follow-up average ( range 3 12 month ) follow treatment . We observe one attack follow treatment single patient , whereas 14 attack would predict pre-treatment attack rate ( p=0.012 , paired test compare pre- post-treatment attack rate ) . Nevertheless , observed impact treatment recovery would expect spontaneous recovery deserve investigation . If B cell essential pathogenesis recurrent attack NMO , B cell depletion may induce sustained remission . We also observe one case , dramatic recovery electrophysiological conduction optic nerve ( visual evoke potential ) , imply case , rituxan impair repair mechanism , example , demyelination follow acute attack .</detailed_description>
