	<brief_title>Preoperative Stent Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients suffer locally invasive tumour process Periampullary area usually seek medical attention jaundice . Not patient suffer jaundice show significant symptom exhaustion purity , also high risk develop post-operative complication . Experimentally , liver exhibit reduce capacity tolerate ischemia presence jaundice . Several different etiologic factor suggest cause complication presence toxic substance bilirubin bile salt , impair nutritional status , effect endotoxin , bacterial translocation , modulation inflammatory cascade cytokine release , reduction cellular immunity nutritional . These complication primarily consist septic complication ( cholangitis , abscess , leakage ) , haemorrhage , impair wound heal renal disorder . Summarily , issue motivate pre-operative bile flow drainage way stent . Traditionally , pre-operative bile flow drainage achieve insertion EP consider easy remove cause less tissue reaction bile duct . However , multiple study find disadvantage EP provide poor bile drainage SEMS . In palliative situation , metal stent associate few side-effects form fever relapse jaundice , etc . These effect likely due well bile flow stent . It remain unclear metal stent provide similar advantage curative situation .</detailed_description>
