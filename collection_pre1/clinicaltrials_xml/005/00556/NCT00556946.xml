	<brief_summary>This research study design determine effect port wine stain ( PWS ) liposomal benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ( BPD-MA ) term verteporfin intravenous ( IV ) infusion photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) combine PDT pulse dye laser ( PDL ) therapy ( PDT + PDL ) . The standard treatment PWS PDL alone . This lighten PWS many lesion completely remove . PDT use medication light together cause injury target . The medication give light direct desired area treatment achieve effect . PDT use treat skin condition include pre-cancers skin cancer . Using PDT PDT immediately follow PDL therapy may improve PWS lightening . At time , PDT PDT + PDL therapy treatment PWS investigational . The type amount medication light may use treat PWS know , likely different use PDT treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Procedures perform Surgery Laser Clinic Beckman Laser Institute University California , Irvine . At initial visit , brief history physical performed . The history include : 1 ) previous treatment PWS ; 2 ) current medication ; 3 ) history light sensitivity ; 4 ) risk pregnancy use birth control female child-bearing age . The physical include : 1 ) measurement evaluation PWS ; 2 ) measurement blood pressure , blood cell count , general chemistry ( include liver function test ) ANA , might indicate increased sensitivity light . On day treatment , brief physical history repeat . A urine pregnancy test perform female child-bearing age . Four circular test site PWS select . One test site receive treatment . The second test site treat pulsed dye laser standard set protective eyeglass shield eye laser treatment . For two additional test spot , photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) verteporfin administer intravenously 10-minute period . After receive verteporfin , skin eye sensitive light next 5 day . The light sensitive protection precaution instruct . Optical Doppler Tomography unit ( ODT ) measurement , similar shin flash light PWS measure light response , provide information blood flow PWS . Photographs light measurement take follow-up visit day 1 , day 3 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 12 week study treatment . At visit blood may also draw check blood substance promote blood vessel formation . At end study , blood test draw assess cell count general chemistry .</detailed_description>
