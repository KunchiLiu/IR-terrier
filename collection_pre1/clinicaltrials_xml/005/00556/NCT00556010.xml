	<brief_summary>Ankle fracture common injury operate routinely . In order restore long term function prevent arthritis ankle break fragment put place precisely . Inadequate reduction result pain long term disability . Recently , base MRI study clinical study , significant number ankle fracture apparently fix less optimal result . We suggest use new device enables well three dimensional image improve quality operation perform ankle fracture .</brief_summary>
