	<brief_summary>This 2 x 2 sequential factorial study evaluate two potential improvement standard immunosuppression regimen use investigator ' institution prevent rejection transplant kidney . These two potential improvement apply sequence half study patient , create 4 study arm ; half receive standard treatment . The two potential improvement : 1 . Administering immunosuppression induction agent rATG ( `` rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin '' ) single dose time transplantation , instead usual series 4 small dos 6 day . 2 . After 6 month , modify maintenance immunosuppression use prevent rejection replace drug tacrolimus mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) . The two intervention , space sequentially six month apart , enable independent analysis two treatment long show synergistic interaction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The two treatment innovation study immunosuppression kidney transplantation aim make transplanted kidney function sooner last longer usual standard immunosuppression regimen , without increase likelihood rejection . The first innovation , deliver induction agent rATG single large dose rather series small dose 6-8 day , expect produce good graft function right away , possibly reduce injury kidney accompany restoration blood flow transplantation ( `` reperfusion injury '' ) . Some evidence develop investigator elsewhere suggest happen . The second innovation , replace tacrolimus MMF 6 month , intend eliminate well-established major cause ongoing toxic damage kidney . While tacrolimus good job prevent rejection , cost continue toxic injury kidney high , lead inevitably eventual graft failure , inability transplant kidney continue filter blood make adequate volume high-quality urine .</detailed_description>
