	<brief_title>Fast-track Diagnosis Lung Cancer Suspects With PET-CT EUS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background study : Patients pass different diagnostic phase analysis chest X-ray suspicious lung cancer . Long wait time uncertainty outcome waste time unacceptable patient . Hospital visit consequence financial burden . Important reason physician shorten diagnostic tumor analysis . Shortening intensify diagnostic track combine diagnostic staging procedure would preclude unnecessary test procedure , lower total hospital cost per patient may lead satisfaction patient physician . PET-CT important imaging tool lung cancer analysis well CT FDG-PET alone , optimal determination tumour invasion mediastinal adjacent structure . MRI suitable purpose , limited available . EUS-FNA ( carinal lymph node ) , eventually combination CT FDG-PET EBUS-TBNA ( right mediastinal lymph node ) , superior TBNA alone , novel image technique high accuracy . Bronchoscopy provide information tumour type resectability centrally peripherally locate tumour . Mediastinal staging perform add TBNA bronchoscopy high accuracy . PET-CT , superior image mode , could direct best subsequent endoscopic technique obtain tissue diagnosis well lead comprehensive staging patient suspect lung cancer . False negative finding could cause sampling error false interpretation cytopathologist specimen tumour cell poverty . A sensitive immune histochemical analysis could modify EUS-FNA EBUS-TBNA result . Objective study : 1. study feasibility fast one-day diagnostic track include PET-CT subsequent diagnostic/ stag investigation depend PET-CT finding . determine : 2. percentage patient one-day track sufficient diagnosis stag needing investigation . 3. time-spans need diagnosis ( include stag function test ) patient comparison historical study group . 4. amount investigation need obtain diagnosis compare historical study group . 5. effect immuno-histochemical analysis sensitivity data diagnostic procedure . Study design : A Prospective , open , single center , study . Patients admit outpatient pulmonology department general practitioner specialist chest X-ray suspicious lung cancer age 18 80 year suitable participation . The X-ray referral study chest physician ( phone fax ) . Selected patient invited enter study answer questionnaire phone ( p. 31 ) . The questionnaire screen patient ' interest , co-morbidity medication use . Informed consent form , patient information form time table diagnostic day provide mail E-mail case time get short . Waiting time enter study longer one week . Hundred patient recruit mean informed consent . In narrow logistic scheme study subject undergo diagnostic work maximum 3 patient per study day ( p. 32 ) . Patients admit pulmonary ward study day accompany nurse . All patient get PET-CT scanning morning study day . Depending location lesion see PET-CT , invasive diagnostic procedure plan afternoon , accord scheme outline page 33 . In meanwhile , routine blood test , EKG pulmonary function test do . The invasive diagnostic procedure choose , provide ideally diagnosis stage one time . Mediastinal adjacent structure analyse EUS-FNA EBUS-TBNA . EBUS-TBNA use right mediastinal lymph node . Carinal lymph node biopsied EUS-FNA . Mediastinal stag do bronchoscopy alone central locate tumor , peripherally locate lesion analyse EUS-FNA bronchoscopy combination EBUS-TBNA . When enough material available , cytologic specimen store cell cast fix agar . In case negative biopsy , surgical verification follow . When verification prove cytologic biopsy false negative , immune histochemical analysis agar imbed material do retrospectively . When patient recover diagnostic procedure , leave hospital appointment visit one week later inform diagnosis treatment . Additive appointment make term short possible necessary extra diagnostic test need like MRI , exercise test , perfusion test evaluation consultant . The percentage patient diagnostic track lead diagnosis tumor stage one day determine . The number test diagnostic procedure need obtain diagnosis , include tumor stage ( especially final stage NSCLC ) function test , compare historical match study group . This historical study group choose era availability integrate PET-CT ultrasound guide endoscopic tool meet inclusion exclusion criterion patient study . The timeline initial chest X-ray diagnostic day inform patient start treatment determine . These figure compare historical study group . Finally , patient ask fill patient satisfaction questionnaire concern one-day diagnostic program track , informative visit eventual successive treatment start ( p. 31 ) . Study population : Hundred patient suspicion lung cancer X ray age 18-85 year admit pulmonologist general practitioner specialist . Intervention ( applicable ) : One-day diagnostic track use PET-CT eventually bronchoscopy , EUS-FNA , EBUS-TBNA ultrasound guide transcutaneous biopsy . Primary study parameters/outcome study : 1 . Number patient definitive diagnosis final stage NSCLC one day . 2 . Time chest X-ray suspicion lung cancer first visit outpatient clinic . 3 . Time first outpatient clinical contact inform patient definite diagnosis . 4 . Time definite diagnosis initiation therapy . Secundary study parameters/outcome study ( applicable ) : 1 . Number patient able diagnostic test one-day . 2 . Number test procedure perform . 3 . Patient satisfaction one-day procedure . 4 . Sensitivity EUS-FNA EBUS-TBNA immunohistochemical analysis add investigate false negative procedure . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness ( applicable ) : There different adverse effect due diagnostic program . Patients one-day diagnostic track undergo diagnostic intervention patient outside study . The risk bleed infection due EUS EBUS procedure must mention , although patient would undergo biopsy even would participate trial ; 'additive risk ' . The burden whole diagnostic program could lead psychological distress several investigation within relatively short period . Patients claustrophobia might anxious PET-CT . The expected benefit patient satisfaction due short diagnostic timeframes , less diagnostic procedure faster decision make therapeutic option .</detailed_description>
