	<brief_summary>The main objective protocol follow : 1 . To assess sensitivity specificity ANAM-PD detect cognitive status patient Parkinson disease ( PD ) healthy control ( HC ) . 2 . To validate specific individual domains ANAM-PD cognitive battery comparison available standardized cognitive evaluation scale administer patient Parkinson disease healthy control subject . 3 . To evaluate reliability ANAM-PD battery test compare repeated administration ANAM-PD battery sub-set subject Parkinson disease healthy control . 4 . To characterize cholinergic neurotransmission image vesicular acetylcholine transporter bind 123Iodobenzovesamicol ( IBVM ) SPECT PD patient healthy control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>General Design Methods The overall goal proposal validate ANAM-PD assessment tool cognitive status PD . We propose comprehensive strategy evaluate sensitivity specificity ANAM-PD detect cognitive change patient diagnosis PD ( n=50 ) healthy control ( n=25 ) . The specific test domain ANAM-PD battery validate standardized neuropsychological testing , describe detail . The reliability ANAM-PD battery evaluate test-retest procedure subset 50 subject ( 25 PD 25 HC ) . This strategy enable u evaluate individual domain ANAM-PD computerize cognitive test establish battery standard test efficiently measure cognitive change PD . We also propose explore functional neuroimaging cholinergic system use [ 123I ] IBVM SPECT , marker vesicular acetylcholine transporter measure integrity cholinergic neuronal system . Identifying validate ANAM-PD efficient tool assess cognitive change PD explore cholinergic transporter system PD functional neuroimaging could predict sub-sets PD patient 'at risk ' develop dementia help elucidate neurochemistry related cognitive decline PD</detailed_description>
