	<brief_summary>Growing evidence show alter blood flow play major role many vision-threatening disease include glaucoma , diabetic retinopathy , age-related macular degeneration , Central Retinal Vein Occlusion , Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion . Optical coherence tomography , establish imaging technique use eye exam clinical ophthalmology , provide high-resolution cross sectional image retina increase ability understand many eye disease .</brief_summary>
