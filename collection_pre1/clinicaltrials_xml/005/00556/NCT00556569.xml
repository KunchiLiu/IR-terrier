Moreover , school many US city , Bronx , even gymnasiums physical education teacher . Objective : We propose implement test effectiveness feasibility `` Moving Smart '' ( MS ) program , daily , 10-minute classroom-based physical activity program lead teacher integrate academic objective physical activity , increase physical activity ( PA ) level school day Bronx elementary school student . Design/ Methods : A cluster-randomized , wait-listed control trial four Bronx elementary school one-year follow-up longitudinal study . Students two intervention school receive MS 3-times daily , 10-minutes time , addition regular physical education class . Two wait-listed control school receive regular physical education class . Subjects wait-listed control group offer MS program withdrawn intervention group end first year study . A pedometer , objective measure PA child , use determine mean number step student take school hour 5 consecutive day baseline , every 3-months 2-year study period . For longitudinal follow-up , collect data intervention group student teacher PA level every 3-months one-year intervention cessation . We also collect yearly BMIs measure overweight status . Descriptive statistic use portray baseline characteristic group base school , district , region , NYC-wide data . The impact intervention PA measure compare intervention control school use pedometer measurement primary dependent variable student unit analysis . We collect fidelity measure randomly select class intervention school directly observe level PA present . We determine extent MS become part routine school policy follow student teacher intervention school 1-year intervention cessation .</detailed_description>
