	<brief_summary>Diabetic nephropathy become single frequent cause end-stage renal disease . On molecular level , least five major pathway implicate glucose-mediated vascular renal damage could reflect single hyperglycaemia-induced process overproduction reactive oxygen specie . Recent study show inflammation , specifically pro-inflammatory cytokine play determinant role development micro- vascular diabetic complication , attention focus implication TNF-Î± set diabetic nephropathy . Glutathione abundant low-molecular-weight thiol , Glutathione/ glutathione disulfide major redox couple animal cell . N-acetylcysteine effective precursor cysteine tissue Glutathione synthesis . Not N-acetylcysteine exhibit antioxidant property , may also counteract glycation cascade inhibition oxidation . N-acetylcysteine also reduce apoptosis elicit reactive oxygen specie . Indeed , N-acetylcysteine show inhibit reactive oxygen specie induce mesangial apoptosis able protect cell glucose-induced inhibition proliferation .</brief_summary>
