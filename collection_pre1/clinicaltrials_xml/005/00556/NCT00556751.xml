	<brief_title>Evaluating Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) Abnormalities From Young Adulthood Through Middle Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An ECG test detects record electrical activity heart . As diagnostic tool , detect locate source heart problem , include heart attack , irregular heart beat , cardiovascular disease , abnormalities heart . An ECG procedure involve attach electrode skin chest , arm , leg electrode detect electrical signal heart , machine display signal computer screen graph paper . An ECG may beneficial way detect cardiovascular disease low-cost non-invasive test widely available clinical setting . This study examine ECGs study data participant Coronary Artery Risk Development Young Adults ( CARDIA ) study . As ECG abnormality typically begin develop young adult , CARDIA participant provide researcher excellent study population . As part CARDIA study , ECGs obtain participant baseline , Years 7 20 . Study researcher use state-of-the-art technology standardize Minnesota Code Novacode method electronically code participant ' ECGs accomplish following : 1 ) ass frequency ECG abnormalities young adult different race ; 2 ) examine potential risk factor development progression ECG abnormalities ; 3 ) investigate relationship ECG abnormalities measure heart disease ; 4 ) ass difference frequency pattern ECG abnormality different racial group . Study researcher also analyze additional CARDIA study data , include cardiovascular disease risk factor , measure atherosclerosis , echocardiographic ultrasound picture heart . This research provide important insight way ECG abnormality associate increase risk cardiovascular disease risk may differ black white . Results study may ultimately lead improvement preventive strategy cardiovascular disease young adult .</detailed_description>
