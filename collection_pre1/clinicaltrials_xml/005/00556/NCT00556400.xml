	<brief_summary>This study explore role oral contraceptive pill manage uterine bleed woman low blood platelet count result aplastic anemia . Oral contraceptive pill show effective manage uterine bleed healthy woman , effect thoroughly study woman low platelet count . The purpose study determine whether oral contraceptive pill useful complement platelet transfusion woman aplastic anemia uterine bleeding . Volunteers study must woman 12 55 year age diagnose aplastic anemia ( platelet count le 50,000/microliter ) currently active uterine bleeding . Candidates must pregnant breastfeeding , must uterus least one functioning ovary , must willing use nonhormonal method birth control ( condom diaphragm ) duration study . On first visit , candidate screen complete medical history ( include obstetric gynecological history ) undergo physical examination , pelvic exam pelvic ultrasound . Blood urine sample also take first visit . The study last approximately two week . Participants ask monitor medication dose severity bleed course study . After first visit , participant separate two randomize group receive either one tablet oral contraceptive placebo twice daily , take 12 hour apart time day . Participants also receive platelet transfusion need ensure platelet count remain 20,000/microliter . After seven day , researcher assess participant ' uterine bleeding participant give oral contraceptive second week study . Participants whose bleed decrease receive one tablet ; participant still moderate severe uterine bleed receive two tablet . A final assessment perform day 14 study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Menorrhagia Women With Thrombocytopenia Using Platelets Platelets Hormones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low platelet count occur result blood disease like bone marrow failure , undergoing procedure chemotherapy treatment stem cell transplantation . A major complication low platelet count reproductive age woman uterine bleeding , life threatening . Sometimes bleed begin normal menstrual cycle may start unexpectedly . In either instance , stop uterine bleeding require blood product include platelet also hormonal treatment . The hormone estrogen progesterone aid set presumably promote endometrial angiogenesis . Continuous oral contraceptive pill ( OCP ) show effective management heavy menstrual bleed healthy woman , study carry woman low platelet count . Moreover , side-effects contraceptive . High-dose intravenous Premarin also useful couple day heavy bleeding ensue . Progestin hormones similarly effective also contraceptive . Oral contraceptive pill routinely use control uterine bleed thrombocytopenia secondary bone marrow failure , chemotherapy and/or stem cell transplantation , episodes severe thrombocytopenia . There current data support whether use hormonal management necessary addition platelet transfusion . We expect show use continuous OCP addition platelet transfusion result well rapid control uterine bleed platelet transfusion . Eligible subject hemodynamically stable , menstruate woman age 12-55 , bone marrow failure , undergo chemotherapy and/or stem cell transplantation diseases platelet level less 50,000/ microliter present heavy menstrual bleeding expect last least 2 week . Subjects randomize either continuous OCP ( Lo-ovral ) 1 tablet twice daily placebo twice daily one week . All subject receive platelet transfusion keep platelet level 20,000 per microliter throughout study . After one week , subject continue bleed receive continuous OCP 1 tablet twice daily . Those stop bleed receive continuous OCP 1 tablet daily . Treatments compare proportion stop vaginal bleed 7 14 day start treatment .</detailed_description>
