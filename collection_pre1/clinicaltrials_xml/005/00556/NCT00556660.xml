	<brief_summary>The main objective proposal follow : To assess dynamic uptake washout 123-I AV51 , potential imaging biomarker β-amyloid burden brain , use single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) similarly age healthy control Alzheimer 's ( AD ) subject To perform blood metabolite characterization 123-I AV51 healthy AD subject determine metabolic fate nature metabolites assessment 123-I AV51 single photon compute tomography ( SPECT ) brain image agent Evaluate test/retest reproducibility 123-I AV51 SPECT AD subject healthy control</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Plan : General Design Methods . The underlying goal study assess 123-I AV51 SPECT image tool detect ß-amyloid deposition brain AD research participant age- gender-matched healthy subject . All study procedure conduct Institute Neurodegenerative Disorders ( IND ) Molecular NeuroImaging ( MNI ) New Haven , CT . Approximately 20 patient Alzheimers disease ( AD ) 10 healthy control recruit participate study . Healthy control examined ensure evidence neurodegenerative change include cognitive decline . Informed consent obtain . All subject undergo screen evaluation include baseline clinical laboratory testing , baseline physical neurological evaluation baseline cognitive evaluation . Subjects ask undergo bolus injection 123-I AV51 . Subjects undergo serial SPECT imaging scan serial venous plasma sample measurement 123-I AV51 plasma ( protein bound free ) period 6 hour . Subjects may ask undergo second image visit 2 6 week follow initial image visit follow similar procedure initial image visit evaluate reproducibility image measure use procedure . The imaging analyse perform image-processing specialist remain masked procedure employ image acquisition . The primary imaging outcome measure brain regional distribution volume express brain tissue plasma ratio radioligand , 123-I AV51 . Time peak uptake amplitude peak uptake evaluate brain region result AD patient control compare . For subject undergo repeat image visit , data initial scan compare second scan determine offer reproducibility image outcome measure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy Control Subject Selection . Healthy control subject neurological disease recruit study . The following criterion meet inclusion healthy control subject study : The participant 50 year old . Written inform consent obtain . Negative history neurological psychiatric illness base evaluation research physician . MiniMental Status Exam score ≥28 . For female , nonchild bear potential negative urine blood pregnancy test day 123I AV51 injection . Alzheimer 's Subject Selection . Subjects clinical diagnosis mild moderate Alzheimer 's disease recruit study . The following criterion meet inclusion AD subject study : The participant 50 year old . Written inform consent obtain . Participants clinical diagnosis Alzheimer 's disease base National Institute Neurological Communicative Disorders Stroke/Alzheimer 's Disease Related Disorders Association ( NINCDS/ADRDA ) criterion . MiniMental Status Exam score &lt; 25 . Modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale score ≤ 4 . Geriatric Depression Scales ( GDS ) ≤ 10 . For female , nonchild bear potential negative urine blood pregnancy test day 123I AV51 injection . Healthy control subject exclude participation follow reason : The subject clinically significant abnormal laboratory value and/or clinically significant unstable medical psychiatric illness . The subject disorder may interfere drug absorption distribution , metabolism , excretion ( include gastrointestinal surgery ) . The subject evidence clinically significant gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , renal , hematological , neoplastic , endocrine , neurological , immunodeficiency , pulmonary , disorder disease . Pregnancy Alzheimer 's subject exclude participation follow reason : The subject sign symptoms another neurodegenerative disease include Parkinson 's disease , diffuse Lewy body dementia , history significant cerebrovascular disease . The subject clinically significant abnormal laboratory value and/or clinically significant unstable medical psychiatric illness The subject disorder may interfere drug absorption distribution , metabolism , excretion ( include gastrointestinal surgery )</criteria>
