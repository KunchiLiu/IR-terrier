	<brief_summary>Enterra Therapy Gastric Simulation System ( Enterra Therapy ) indicate treatment patient long term , uncontrolled ( helped medication ) nausea vomit gastroparesis diabetic idiopathic origin . In March 2000 , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) give approval humanitarian Device Exemption ( HDE ) Humanitarian Use Device ( HUD ) Enterra Therapy Gastric electrical ( GES ) Simulation System . Although , evidence suggests use Enterra Therapy System probably help patient , symptom , FDA 's HDE approval indicate helpfulness therapy proven . Physicians Columbia University Medical Center hope prove helpfulness device .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gastroparesis debilitate disease patient suffer number upper gastrointestinal ( GI ) symptoms include nausea , vomit , early satiety , bloating , postprandial fullness , epigastric pain burning , cardiac pain burning . Severe symptom , particularly vomit nausea , significantly impair patient daily activity quality life . Current medical practice treatment and/or management gastroparesis consist dietary modification , drug therapy , enteral feeding , parenteral feeding surgery . These treatment successful patient , significant drawback . Patients may initially treat various dietary modification include frequent low fat meal . However , dietary modification alone unsuccessful , antiemetic prokinetic drug , combination thereof , generally try . If symptom control medication , supplemental nutrition via enteral parenteral feeding may require maintain hydration nutritional status . Prokinetic drug intend promote gastric motility , i.e. , return abnormally slow gastric empty state normal . Antiemetic drug intend alleviate symptom nausea vomit , effect motility . None prokinetic drug label improved gastric empty gastroparesis . Metoclopramide antiemetic prokinetic drug indicate use treatment symptom diabetic gastroparesis . Surgical procedure occasionally employ manage symptom gastroparesis maintain ability enteral feeding . Surgical procedure , include gastrectomy , pyloroplasty , gastrojejunostomy , limited success manage symptoms gastroparesis . When drug therapy surgery ineffective , supplemental enteral feeding via gastric jejunal feeding tube total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) may require meet patient 's nutritional need . For patient adequately treat manage current medical practice , GES satisfactory alternative . It group patient GES System indicate .</detailed_description>
