However , patient may eventually develop tachyphylaxis anti-inflammatory activity mid-potency high-potency topical corticosteroid patient severe , chronic involvement may often less likely respond . Potential topical alternative corticosteroid include psoralen plus ultraviolet ( PUVA ) , phototherapy inconvenient multiple clinical visit require hand phototherapy unit may available . Moisturizers find help restore skin barrier provide protective layer surface skin trap water prevent penetration irritant allergens . An emollient cream superior trapping moisture within skin . Emollients may form cover film , act barrier chemical exterior restricts loss water essential substance interior . E-DO gel potential agent revitalize skin cell regain moisture retention capacity . E-DO known significant improvement wound heal inhibition Staphylococcus aureus Propionibacterium acne . This pilot research trial investigate effect topical E-DO patient hand dermatitis .</detailed_description>
