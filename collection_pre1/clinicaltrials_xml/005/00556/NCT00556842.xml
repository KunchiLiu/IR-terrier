	<brief_summary>Each year , hip fracture , injury impair independence quality life , occur 280,000 Americans 36,000 Canadians . By year 2040 , annual healthcare cost associate hip fracture expect reach $ 9.8 billion United States $ 650 million Canada . It important place optimal practice guideline surgical handle injury . One type hip fracture , call displaced femoral neck fracture , often treated hip replacement surgery . Patients undergo hip replacement may receive either total hip replacement , head femur hip joint socket replace , partial hip replacement , head femur replace . This study compare two different hip replacement procedure determine one result well outcomes surgery adult age 50 old .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Total Hip Arthroplasty Hemi-Arthroplasty Secondary Procedures Quality Life Adults With Displaced Hip Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One type hip fracture , call femoral neck fracture , involve break narrow part femur bone head femur join main shaft . The break either undisplaced , involve little separation fracture site , displace , substantial separation . For displaced fracture , surgeon usually choose internal fixation hip arthroplasty , also know hip replacement . Patients receive hip arthroplasty may undergo either total hip arthroplasty hemi-arthroplasty . Which surgical method best patient unknown . Advocates total hip replacement claim well improvement patient function quality life . On hand , advocate hemi-arthroplasty , include orthopaedic surgeon , claim reduce rate dislocation deep vein thrombosis , short operate time , less blood loss , technically less demand surgical procedure . This study compare total hip arthroplasty hemi-arthroplasty rate revision surgery 2 year patient age 50 old sustain femoral neck fracture undergo surgery . The study also compare impact two different surgical procedure function , quality life , post-surgical complication . Results study may impact current orthopaedic practice . Participation study last 2 year . Before surgery , participant complete baseline assessment include x-ray , medical history review , physical examination . Participants randomly assign undergo either total hip arthroplasty hemi-arthroplasty repair hip fracture . All surgeon need meet certain criterion partake study expertise whichever surgical procedure perform . Surgeons also follow manufacturer ' implant guideline surgery . Specific aspect preoperative post-operative care , weight bearing status , prevention thromboembolic disease , use antibiotic calcium supplementation , standardized participant . Within 2 day go surgery , x-rays perform . Follow-up assessment complete either phone in-person hospital clinic . They occur 1 10 week surgery 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 month surgery . All assessment include questionnaire interview health status , hip function , pain , functional mobility , revision surgery . Some in-person assessment also include x-ray .</detailed_description>
