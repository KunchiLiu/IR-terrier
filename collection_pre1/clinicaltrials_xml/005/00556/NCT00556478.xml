	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness , safety tolerability investigational drug , PSD502 subject premature ejaculation ( PE ) The study drug , PSD02 , meter dose ( measure dose ) , topical ( applied skin surface ) anesthetic ( numb ) spray contain mixture lidocaine prilocaine . The study drug apply spray penis prior intercourse order decrease sensitivity attempt delay ejaculation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy , Safety Tolerability PSD502 ( Topical Anesthetic ) Treatment Premature Ejaculation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most study evaluate treatment PE include intravaginal ejaculatory latency time ( IELT ) definition PE . It estimate PE affect 30-40 % male population , paradoxically condition least likely seek help . Men PE exhibit abnormal autonomic reflex pathway ejaculatory process . These include low vibratory threshold ejaculation , shorter bulbocavernous latency time higher bulbocavernous evoked potential . Reducing heightened sensitivity glans penis topical anesthetic might therefore way improve IELT , without adversely affect sensation ejaculation . Although IELT objective measure ejaculatory function address impact therapy patient ' well confidence sexual performance , important marker treatment benefit . Therefore , IELT use sole efficacy measure may fully characterise treatment benefit patient . For reason , patient report outcome ( PRO ) know Index Premature Ejaculation ( IPE ) use study conjunction IELT evaluate efficacy . Thus combination objective measure ejaculatory latency PRO IPE able provide efficacy data representative clinical benefit patient . The use lidocaine , prilocaine EMLA® cream topical anesthetic well establish . Many year experience use large number patient , well comprehensive non-clinical safety test program various formulation lidocaine prilocaine exist , support safety tolerability . This information , together clinical data 3 study PSD502 ( ANAE-059-00 , PSD502-PE-001 , PSD502-PE-003 ) , suggest PSD502 may beneficial effect reduce penile sensation prolong IELT , use unlikely associate significant clinical safety tolerability concern . The aim study provide additional placebo-controlled efficacy data establish clinical utility PSD502 treatment PE . In addition , long term open-label efficacy safety data collect , support registration package PSD502 indication treatment PE .</detailed_description>
