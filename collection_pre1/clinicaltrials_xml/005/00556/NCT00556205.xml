	<brief_summary>The purpose research study define effective strategy people renal cell carcinoma learn safety effectiveness two different type sunitinib-refractory treatment : Bevacizumab alone combination sunitinib bevacizumab . Sunitinib FDA approve drug currently one standard treatment advance renal cell carcinoma . However , people receive treatment respond treatment stop respond treatment . Bevacizumab FDA approve drug use treatment several cancer however , yet approve use renal cell carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab With Without Sunitinib Sunitinib-Refractory Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants receive one two treatment possibility . Since one know study option best , participant `` randomize '' one fo three treatment group . - Group 1 stop current treatment sunitinib receive dose bevacizumab every 2 week . Group 2 receive standard treatment sunitinib addition bevacizumab . - All study participant undergo study procedure . These study procedure include follow interval specify protocol : medical history review ; vital sign ; physical exam ; urine analysis ; EKG CT scan .</detailed_description>
