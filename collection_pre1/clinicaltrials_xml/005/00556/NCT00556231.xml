	<brief_summary>Near Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) monitor proven beneficial increase safety improve patient care pediatric cardiac surgery Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) stay . NIRS estimate amount oxygen tissue compare tissue 's absorption two wavelength light correspond hemoglobin carry oxygen hemoglobin without oxygen . During cardiac surgery , multi-site NIRS monitoring use determine heart 's output compare amount oxygen available discrete region body nourished different part circulatory system . NIRS lead place forehead detect oxygen available brain ( cerebral ) , lead place kidney reflect oxygen available internal organ ( somatic ) . NIRS monitoring use study muscle oxygen usage exercise normal disease state . Cerebral oxygenation peak exercise study NIRS monitoring . The use multi-site NIRS monitoring exercise stress test study cardiac output pattern somatic cerebral oxygenation combination exercise stress test data research . We hypothesize addition multi-site NIRS monitoring standard data collection already achieve exercise testing , enable calculation anaerobic threshold cardiac output prediction . This assist determine appropriate timing surgical intervention , predict post operative course test response medication .</brief_summary>
