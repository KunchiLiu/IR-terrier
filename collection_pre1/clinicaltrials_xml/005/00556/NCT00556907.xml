	<brief_summary>We hypothesize combination mammography CE-MRI improve surgeon radiologist 's ability define extent disease prior surgical resection , improve odds obtain clear surgical margin , increase efficacy IORT deliver immediately initial surgical resection . In investigation , determine whether patient deem eligible 'immediate '' IORT base mammography CE-MRI successfully treat without need re-excision additional radiotherapy due inadequate surgical margin .</brief_summary>

Patient history , physical examination finding , demographic ( sex , age , height , weight , bra size , etc . ) perform document . Inclusion Criteria Initial Registration ( patient cohort ) : All cohort Signed informed consent HIPAA document Female sex Age great equal 40 year Localized ductal carcinoma situ Clinically and/or histologically negative axillary lymph nod No image clinical finding suggestive invasive carcinoma . Cohort 1 ( Immediate IORT group ) Localized DCIS measure less equal 4 cm preoperative imaging . Cohort 2 ( Delayed IORT group ) Localized DCIS measure less equal to4 cm le surgical pathology Delayed IORT could perform explicit purpose administer IORT perform follow reexcision previously operate breast achieve clear surgical margin . This cohort include patient exclude immediate IORT base preoperative image suggest ineligibility immediate IORT , subsequently find meet histological criterion ( localize DCIS less equal 4 cm invasive cancer ) IORT base surgical pathology . Unifocal microinvasive ( T1mic invasive focus less equal 1mm maximal diameter ) allow follow initial WLE surgical pathology margin less equal to2 mm invasive noninvasive component . Delayed IORT must perform within 3 month initial WLE . Cohort 3 Subjects receive IORT time initial WLE whose surgical pathology show unsuitable candidate IORT alone basis : DCIS measure great 5 cm surgical pathology . T1a ( less 1 mm ) large invasive carcinoma associate extensive DCIS . Surgical margin width less than1 mm .
