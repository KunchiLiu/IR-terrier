	<brief_title>Examining Genetic Factors That Affect Severity 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>22q11.2 deletion syndrome disorder cause deletion small piece chromosome 22 . Most people disorder miss sequence 3 million DNA building block chromosome 22 within cell . This disorder affect many area body . People 22q11.2 deletion syndrome may heart defect , immune deficiency , kidney abnormality , hear loss , cleft palate facial deformity . Many child experience developmental delay learn disability , increase risk develop mental illness , include schizophrenia , depression , anxiety , bipolar disorder . All people 22q11.2 deletion syndrome miss sequence DNA , severity disorder varies widely ; people diagnose multiple health developmental problem , others experience symptom . In people , symptom may minimal even aware 22q11.2 deletion syndrome . This study examine genetic material—either blood saliva—among people 22q11.2 deletion syndrome . Participants attend one study visit undergo either blood saliva collection . By analyze DNA sequence participant , study aim identify genetic variation may affect severity 22q11.2 deletion syndrome .</detailed_description>
