	<brief_title>TACE Adjuvant Therapy After Radiofrequency Ablation ( RFA ) Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Local ablation safe effective therapy patient undergo resection , bridge transplantation . Of various percutaneous local ablative therapy , radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) attract great interest effectiveness safety small HCC ≤ 5.0 cm , 3-year survival rate 62 % 68 % , low treatment morbidity 0 % 12 % , low treatment mortality 0 % 1 % . Prospective randomize trial show RFA well percutaneous ethanol injection ( PEI ) produce high rate complete tumor necrosis few number treatment session well survival . Unfortunately , complete tumor necrosis rate tumor large 5 cm less favorable , local recurrence rate high 20 % even small HCC le 3.5 cm . The high local recurrence rate may due residual cancer cell kill RFA adjacent microscopic satellite tumor nodule . Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization ( TACE ) proven effective palliative therapy unresectable HCC . And prospective randomize controlled trial show adjuvant TACE curative resection HCC improve overall survival decrease recurrence rate . But study TACE adjuvant therapy RFA HCC . Thus , purpose study prospectively evaluate whether TACE adjuvant therapy RFA HCC improve outcomes RFA .</detailed_description>
