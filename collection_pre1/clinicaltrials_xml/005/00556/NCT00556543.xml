	<brief_title>Clinical Study U-Plate Fracture Repair System Treat Rib Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rib fracture painful disable injury commonly find among trauma patient . According National Center Health Statistics , approximately 300,000 people rib fracture treat emergency ambulatory care department United States year 2004 . Rib fracture patient significantly disable 30 day post-injury patient chronic medical illness lose average 70 day work usual activity acute recovery . The rationale conduct study demonstrate prospective study U-plate repair system durable safe . Although clinical outcome data require FDA market implant prosthesis , investigator believe order U-plate widely accept , prospectively collect outcome data necessary . With goal improve durability fixation rib fracture technique currently available additional goal develop minimally invasive technique , U-shaped plate develop . The design U-plate theoretically overcome inherent softness human rib grasp rib superior margin secure plate anterior posterior lock screw rely screw purchase bone . Thus much strength durability fixation transfer relatively soft rib plate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must least 18 year age Subjects must one four clinical indication list : 1 . Flail chest failure wean ventilator ( &gt; 5 day postinjury ) Paradoxical chest wall movement visualize ; significant pulmonary contusion significant brain injury 2 . Painful , displace rib fracture ( acute pain control ) failure narcotic epidural pain catheter control pain ; fracture movement exacerbate pain ( 7 10 day ) minimal associate injury 3 . Chest wall defect/severely displace fracture nonrepair defect may result pulmonary hernia severely displace fracture significantly impede lung expansion hemithorax 4 . Symptomatic rib fracture nonunion CT scan evidence fracture nonunion least 2 month postinjury Subjects enrol another investigational treatment trial Subjects receive investigational drug device within 30 day enrollment Subjects unable complete followup questionnaire Subjects severe head injury severe associate injury Subjects expect survive followup period Female subject pregnant NonEnglish English Second Language speaker</criteria>
