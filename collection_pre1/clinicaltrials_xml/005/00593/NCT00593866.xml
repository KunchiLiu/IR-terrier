	<brief_summary>This research study pancreatic cancer . One way improve result current standard treatment try new approach . This study examine use advance radiation therapy technique , call intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) , chemotherapy . All subject study treated gemcitabine . This chemotherapy agent use patient pancreatic cancer . The researcher already do study use radiation therapy gemcitabine . They want build information previous research . The researcher want find best dose IMRT give time patient receive gemcitabine . To , vary total dose radiation receive patient study base information available previously treat patient . The goal research identify high dose IMRT give time chemotherapy without cause severe side effect .</brief_summary>
