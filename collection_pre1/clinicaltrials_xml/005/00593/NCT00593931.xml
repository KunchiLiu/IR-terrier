	<brief_title>Development Of New Techniques For Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Of The Brain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New technique cover wide range clinical scientific application develop , test evaluate . These include 1 . Investigation sensory stimulus process cognitive processing , normal subject patient psychiatric disorder , 2 . Early detection stroke ischemic injury , 3 . Characterization tumor distribution activity . The new technique routinely need test respect follow : 1 . Sensitivity blood oxygenation versus blood flow versus blood volume contrast mechanism , 2 . Signal-to-noise contrast-to-noise ratio , 3 . Spatial temporal resolution , 4 . Distribution severity image artifact , 5 . Duty cycle limitation . Most clinical application require coverage entire brain consequently high duty cycle operation , need trade spatial temporal resolution , well contrast mechanism . The work also involve test different experimental paradigm ( time sequence stimulus cognitive task ) identify provide high signal change associate specific brain activity interest . Although 3T provide twice signal 1.5T system , research application image quality advantage 3T may outweigh effect high field signal . Consequently , new technique evaluate 1.5T 3T system , decision make base upon overall image quality , regard system use . The Protocol involve injection contrast agent drug , minimally-invasive invasive procedure . It intend specifically study subject require , addition try relax lie still , experience respond various non-harmful sensory stimulus , perform common cognitive ( e.g . math calculation ) motor ( e.g . finger tap ) task .</detailed_description>
