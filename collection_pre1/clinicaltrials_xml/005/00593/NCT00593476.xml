	<brief_summary>The purpose trial study safety efficacy pre-packaged , portion control meal plan weight loss glycemic control overweight obese patient type 2 diabetes . Aim 1 - Effects Weight Assess effect pre-packaged , portion control meal plan weight loss overweight obese patient type 2 diabetes . The researcher hypothesize pre-packaged , portion control diet ( PCD ) produce great weight loss diabetes support education ( DSE ) program 12 week . The study power detect group differences 3 % body weight . Secondarily , researcher assess whether difference weight secondary phase week 13-24 group consume PCD diet . Aim 2 - Effects Glycemic Control Assess effect pre-packaged , portion control meal plan glycemic control overweight obese patient type 2 diabetes . The researcher hypothesize PCD show great improvement HbA1c level DSE group 12 week . The study power detect group difference .5 % HbA1c . Secondarily , improvement difference HbA1c week 13-24 group consume PCD assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Assess Pre-packaged , Portion-controlled Meal Plan Weight Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General Design Randomized , non-blinded , control clinical trial use parallel cross-over design either treatment group receive pre-packaged , portion-controlled ( PCD ) meal plan 24 week ( week 0-24 ) control group receive 12 week diabetes support education ( DSE ) ( week 0-12 ) cross 12 week PCD week 13-24 . Study Population Up 120 volunteer type 2 diabetes 21-75 year age overweight obese ( body mass index ≥ 25 ≤ 50 kg/m2 ) fast HbA1c level 6.0 great . Inclusion Criteria : Participants must meet follow criterion 1 . Type 2 diabetic men non-pregnant non-lactating woman age 21 75 2 . BMI ≥ 25 ≤ 50 3 . Subjects must willing comply study-related procedure 4 . Participant screen HbA1C ≥ 6.0 Exclusion Criteria : If participant meet one follow criterion exclude 1 . Use insulin pharmaceutical agent diabetic control thiazolidinedione ( TZD ) , Sulfonylurea 's , Metformin combination medication . 2 . BMI ≤ 24.9 ≥ 50.1 3 . Participation another formal weight loss program within last 6 month 4 . Participation Diabetes Support Education Program formal diabetes education program within last 6 month 5 . Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg ) . Participants medication treat hypertension least three month allowable . 6 . Known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 7 . History congestive heart failure 8 . History non-skin malignancy within previous 5 year 9 . Any major active rheumatologic , pulmonary , hepatic , renal , dermatologic disease inflammatory condition Detailed Disease Lab Value Exclusions : Active rheumatologic , dermatologic disease , autoimmune/inflammatory condition define patient currently , past medical history chronic ( &gt; 2 week ) immune modulating/suppressing medication . Active pulmonary disease define patient history , currently require , daily oral corticosteroid , leukotriene inhibitor , oxygen requirement , ventilation support chronic disease management . Active hepatic disease : define patient currently , history require immune modulating/suppressing medication , ammonia lower medication , hepatic disease relate diet modification . Active renal disease : define patient currently , history require potassium phosphate lowering medication , protein restriction diet , hemo/peritoneal dialysis . Lab value exclusion limit routine electrolyte value outside normal range , except glucose . ( Sodium , potassium , chloride , bicarbonate , BUN , creatinine . ) 10 . History test HIV positive 11 . History alcohol drug abuse 12 . Weight-loss inducing medication dietary supplement within 3 month prior enrollment . 13 . Weight loss &gt; 5 kg last 6 month 14 . Participation weight loss study investigational drug study within 6 week prior screen 15 . Serious unstable medical psychological condition , opinion investigator , would compromise subject 's safety successful participation study . 16 . Participants screen triglyceride 500 mg 17 . Anyone physically active ≥ 30 minute per day assess clinical interview screen visit 18 . Uncontrolled Dyslipidemia . Participants stable medication treat dyslipidemia least 3 month allowable . Physical Measures Diabetes control : Measures HbA1c fast glucose take visit 1-4 ass diabetes glycemic control . In addition , track use medication use control diabetes . Dyslipidemia : Lipid/lipoprotein concentration ( total cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol , triglyceride ) measure visit 1-4 . Current medication use collect clinic visit . We use data track incidence prevalence dyslipidemia . Inflammatory Markers : Inflammation measure use high sensitivity C reactive protein ( hs- CRP ) visit 2-4 . Electrocardiograms : Electrocardiograms obtain visit 1 accord standard protocol . Hypertension blood pressure measure : Through blood pressure measurements visit 1-4 , self-reported current medication use , track incidence prevalence hypertension measure periphery artery disease . Weight , height , waist circumference : Body weight measure PCD visit , use calibrated scale . Participants weigh light indoor clothing . Waist circumference measure visit 1-4 . Height measure visit 1 . Serum DNA sample : Samples serum frozen stored future test new emerge cardiovascular risk factor . DNA sample freeze store identify genetic marker diet response . We use sample determine possibility common genetic variant ENPP1 K121Q could predispose diabetic metabolic syndrome subject respond good weight loss intervention common variant K121K . Similarly , genetic variant associate obesity insulin resistance may change susceptibility weight loss different direction . If time study participant decides want serum sample store may destroy Self-Reported Measures Psychosocial measure : A battery psychosocial measure assess include standardized assessment Beck Depression Inventory8 eat disorder questionnaire.9 These survey measure assessed visit 1-4 . Quality life : The Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ) version use measure general health relate quality life visit 1-4.10 It use calculate domain score plus two summary score : physical summary ( four domain , 21 item ) , mental health summary ( four domain , 14 item ) . 7-day Food Records : A 7 day food record record visit 2-4 assess compliance PCD phase 1 2 . Acceptability : Acceptability program ( PCD DSE ) measure visit 2-4 determine tolerability ease program . Socio-demographics : Information employment , household composition , education collect visit 1 . Weight history , personal medical history , family medical history : At visit one . Participants report weight various age , history weight cycling , family personal history disease . Participants refer appropriate treatment eat disorder , depression complication discover result standard care weight lifestyle inventory beck depression inventory administer screening visit . This treatment offer CORE , participant prefer , provider another location relevant complication . Concomitant medication adverse event : At visit 1-4 concomitant medication adverse event record . Additional change assess need throughout study . TREATMENT Eligible volunteer randomly assign treatment group consist pre-packaged , portion control meal plan ( PCD ) control group consist combination diabetes support education ( DSE ) program/pre-packaged , portion control meal plan ( PCD ) cross-over group . Treatment assignment unmasked . At end 24 week treatment group complete 18 group session control group complete 15 group session . The PCD program aim achieve maintain decrease weight 1-24 week . Combination DSE/PCD program aim achieve maintain decrease weight week 13-24 . A Certified Diabetes Educator review effect diet weight loss , exercise , medication blood glucose level among participant first group meeting change dietary intake exercise prescribe . Participants counsel strategy prevent hypoglycemia . In addition cause , symptom treatment hypoglycemia review include contact health care provider .</detailed_description>
