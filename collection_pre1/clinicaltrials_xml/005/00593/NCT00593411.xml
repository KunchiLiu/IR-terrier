	<brief_summary>The collection data myriad service describe significantly impacted NIH guideline define medical research involve human well recent implementation HIPAA constraint complicate conduct retrospective clinical outcome research . Simple case report case series analysis involve IRB participation well voluminous documentation . The solution dilemma lie develop promote secure , confidential prospective clinical database store clinical data subsequent retrospective de-identified inquiry . These database function way analogous `` tissue bank '' subsequent basic science research . Patients consent prospective entry clinical information database long continue patient Department Neurological Surgery Departments Divisions association affiliate program briefly describe . The consent obtain patient 's first inpatient outpatient encounter parallel HIPAA consent . It withdraw request patient time , expire unless patient withdraws , patient severs patient care relationship UCI Neurosurgery affiliate program . The database store separate secure server maintain back UCIMC Information Technology Department . Access database restrict multiple level , majority personnel allow limited access data entry purpose . Only database programmer/coordinator , Department Administrator Chairman Department unrestricted access database . Authority permission level security clearance access database , individual , vest Chairman Department Neurological Surgery . A separate IRB proposal formulate individual study related acquisition data de-identified database . Since future study perform data set derive previously consent subject IRB-approved project , requirement additional consent form anticipate . As result IRB research proposal utilize database expedite . Once specific study approve , investigator ( ) provide clinical information database form de-identified data set .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Department Neurological Surgery enter period rapid growth accompany significant investment infrastructure . The goal effort re-establish full academic mission return residency program part paradigm target initiate program three five year . This rebuild project base pre-existing neurotrauma critical care program three new comprehensive multidisciplinary clinical program medical center product line . These include neuro-oncology , operative non-operative spine service cerebrovascular service . The care treatment patient ischemic stroke part cerebrovascular program . Aggressive accelerate clinical outcome research rapid peer-review publication mission critical need successfully apply re-establish residency train program . The collection data also strengthen market promote advancement multidisciplinary program . While Neurosurgery Department central multidisciplinary program evolution affiliate program product line involve multiple department . These include : Neurology stroke service neurology critical care service ; Radiology neuroradiology interventional neuroradiology service ; Hematology/Oncology Services associate Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center ; Radiation Oncology ; Otolaryngology Services ; Orthopedic Spine Services ; , Physiatry Physical Rehabilitative Medicine Services . MD Analyze commercially available relational data base software program design accumulate clinical data future analysis . It allow investigator determine clinical data wish collect , include , limited history , physical , laboratory , radiographic , surgical follow-up information .

Patients treat investigator practice UCI ask sign consent HIPAA form make aware right protection regard health care information give informed consent collect analyze health care data . Throughout course care may ask complete various survey data collection instrument depend diagnosis treatment . See Appendix A copy data collection instrument survey . The system allow personal clinical data de-identified ( i.e. , make anonymous ) . A full-time data entry clerk collect enter clinical data MD Analyze data base . This person also ask search retrieve data base investigator ' research question proposal IRB approve . Only Department Chairman , Data Base Manager , Department Administrator access personal identification data . This information available investigator . Potential investigator data base provide documentation IRB approval project Chair request data set harvest data base . The chair direct Data Base Manager generate report request data . The report de-identified data securely deliver investigator . The Data Base Manager maintain file request data copy IRB approval investigator research data request . Minors may ask complete survey questionnaire appropriate read level . Patients may withdraw time make request physician investigator staff .</detailed_description>
