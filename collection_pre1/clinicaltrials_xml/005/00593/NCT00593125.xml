	<brief_title>Levetiracetam ( Keppra ) Tolerability Cocaine Abusing Methadone-maintained Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 12-week open-label clinical trial provide treatment 15 cocaine-dependent opioid dependent patient . Participants , age 18-65 year , receive levetiracetam 3000 mg/day concurrently receive treatment methadone . Baseline cocaine use determine first week treatment participation . The study design three overlap phase summarize : 1 ) A one week methadone fix induction ( week 1 ) flexible stabilization phase ( week 2-9 ) ; 2 ) 8-week `` treatment '' phase ( week 2-9 ) , consist slow titration stabilization study medication ; 3 ) four week `` taper , detoxification transfer '' phase ( week 9-12 ) . During first week induction onto methadone , participant administer fixed increase dos methadone start 30 mg daily increase 60 mg daily end first week . This methadone dose adjust stabilization opiate withdrawal symptom use flexible dose 40 mg 150 mg . This range find adequate vast majority patient receive methadone program design accommodate participant may able tolerate high maintenance dos may still experience withdrawal symptom , respectively . We may increase decrease amount case-by-case basis base physician assessment self-reported observe symptom . Starting week 2 subject receive levetiracetam 500mg/day dose slowly titrate total 3000mg/day maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Subjects remain full dosage week 8 . At end week 8 , participant undergo detoxification methadone 4-week period ( week 8-12 ) discontinuation levetiracetam concurrent 2-week period . All participant receive weekly 1-hour individual psychotherapy ( Cognitive Behavioral Treatment ) experience clinician specifically train deliver therapy receive ongoing supervision . The primary outcome report medication side effect ( medication tolerability ) , reduction cocaine use , assess self-report thrice-weekly urinalysis . Secondary outcome include week treatment ( retention ) , change measure : cocaine craving , anxiety symptom opiate withdrawal symptom .
