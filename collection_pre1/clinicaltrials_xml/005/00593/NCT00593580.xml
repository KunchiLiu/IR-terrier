	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . To evaluate impact bisphosphonates bone mineral density ( BMD=primary endpoint ) woman gynecologic malignancy undergo chemotherapy . 2 . To determine bone loss woman gynecologic malignancy undergo chemotherapy correlate clinicopathologic parameter gather investigation i.e. , race , tumor stage . Introduction : Dramatic bone loss woman first five year follow cessation ovarian function well document ( 1 ) . It estimate great 1.5 million fracture related osteoporosis ( OP ) occur US annually ( 2 ) 33 % woman sustain hip fracture age 90 year ( 3 ) . With increase age also come increase risk many cancer , include ovarian , uterine , breast , lung , colon cancer . 23,500 new case ovarian cancer 38,400 new case uterine cancer diagnose US last year ( 4 ) . Many patient postmenopausal time diagnosis , many enter menopause secondary surgical resection ovary chemotherapy prompt ovarian failure . This population woman therefore , significant risk osteoporosis . To author 's knowledge , one study examine bone loss menopausal woman gynecologic cancer undergo chemotherapy ( 5 ) . This small ( n=25 ) prospective observational study control treatment arm . The author observe high incidence baseline bone loss significant additional loss chemotherapy treatment . Bone loss also describe breast cancer patient undergo chemotherapy ( 6,7 ) . Laboratory animal study demonstrate deleterious effect cytotoxic chemotherapy protein synthesis DNA replication , result alter diminish bone formation ( 8-10 ) . We know intervention study postmenopausal woman cancer undergo chemotherapy i.e. , compare different osteoporosis prevention strategy . Estrogen therapy often contraindicate gynecologic malignancy alternative treatment bone loss prevention routinely use gynecologic oncologist . At present guideline and/or recommendation Gynecologic Oncology community preventative treatment bone loss individual undergoing chemotherapy ( even calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation recommendation ) . Justification : Women undergo bilateral oophorectomy receive chemotherapy risk increase bone loss . At present , despite risk factor profile fit indication assessment treatment routine intervention patient population i.e. , standard treatment treatment . We hope identify whether intervention may favorable woman change standard care vulnerable population . The use placebo justified investigation current standard care include treatment prevention bone loss chemotherapy . A recent survey patient active treatment BCCA reveal 1 40 patient gynecologic malignancy undergo chemotherapy take medical therapy bone loss ( Personal communication , J McAlpine J Pike ) . In order provide support bone mineral density ( BMD ) , patient enrol study ( treatment control arm ) receive Calcium ( 1000mg ) Vitamin D supplementation ( 1000 mg ) 12 month study period . FOSAVANCE chosen bisphophonate investigation popular bisphosphonate Canada routinely prescribe thousand men woman . It undergone rigorous scrutiny federal provincial level . Recently , Vitamin D receive considerable press `` anti-cancer '' activity addition know contribution bone growth remodel . Research Plan : This randomized prospective trial woman undergone surgery pathology confirm ovarian ( rarely advance stage endometrial ) malignancy schedule initiate 6 cycle chemotherapy ( without radiation ) ask participate . The primary outcome measure change bone mineral density consecutive DEXA scan compare baseline . All patient undergone removal ovary bilaterally . Some patient may enter menopause naturally many year prior surgical resection ovary . Patients tell difference chemotherapy regimen , perceive impact bisphosphonates success chemotherapy treat disease process . Patients fit inclusion exclusion criterion ( include blood test bone scan criterion ) consent participate randomize receive either weekly oral FOSAVANCE 70 mg alendronate/2800 IU cholecalciferol placebo 12 month study duration . All patient receive calcium 1000 mg vitamin D supplementation 1000 IU daily throughout study period . Bone DEXA scan obtain baseline ( post-surgery prior initiation chemotherapeutic regimen ) , 6 12 month treatment comparison make BMD treatment vs. placebo group . The use placebo justified investigation current standard care include treatment prevention bone loss chemotherapy . Internationally , recommendation subspecialty . The following parameter collect enrolled patient : Age , race , tobacco/smoking history , height/weight/BMI , chemotherapeutic regimen , past medical history , tumor stage , grade , histology , complication , blood loss , length hospital stay , 24 hour creatinine clearance , serum albumin . In addition , , family history osteoporosis and/or spinal hip fracture , blood sample alkaline phosphatase , calcium 25 ( OH ) vitamin D level DEXA scan ( bone scan ) 0 , 6 , 12 month bone mineral density ( BMD ) measurement lumbar spine , leave hip , femoral neck ( T Z-scores ) obtain . These parameter specific interest relate patient bone health risk factor bone loss . DEXA scan individual patient 6 12 month compare starting/baseline DEXA , differences measurement compare patient treatment vs. placebo arm . Careful monitoring patient subjective complaints/comments , complete physical examination , monthly laboratory work closely monitor throughout study period . NOTE : THERE IS NO INTERVENTION IN THIS INVESTIGATION THAT ALTERS THE POSTOPERATIVE CARE , CLINIC VISITS , CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMEN OR DURATION OF TREATMENT IN THESE PATIENTS AS COMPARED TO OUR STANDARD OF CARE . Patients free remove study time compromise management . Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Postmenopausal ( surgical extirpation ovary ) 2 . Primary ovarian endometrial cancer 3 . Planned receive multiagent chemotherapeutic regimen 6 cycle 4 . Signed informed consent 5 . BMD T-score -2.5 0 site Exclusion criterion : 1 . Renal insufficiency CrCl &lt; 35mL/min 2 . BMD T-score &lt; -2.5 site 3 . Medication , excessive alcohol intake , GI disease inhibit GI absorption 4 . Metabolic bone disease , bony metastasis , poorly control thyroid parathyroid condition , Paget 's disease , hormonal therapy/other treatment OP 5 . Abnormalities esophagus delay esophageal empty i.e. , achalasia 6 . Inability stand sit upright least 30 minute 7 . Hypersensitivity component drug product 8 . Requiring/planned external beam radiation study period 9 . Baseline serum 25 ( OH ) vitamin D level &lt; 9ng/mL Recruitment : All patient recruit study come Gynecologic Oncology clinic via referrals/consultations patient primary co-investigators study . Prior enrollment , investigator pathology result make decision whether patient require chemotherapy disease process . If basic inclusion exclusion criterion meet demographic/medical/pathology parameter patient interested consent study , additional blood work bone scan obtain ensure criterion meet . All investigator support staff available review protocol detail patient phone number give call u additional question . There research nurse BCCA resource use protocol . All discussion consent do PI one Co-investigators . Labs outside routine BCCA order ( i.e. , vitamin D level ) do outside facility DEXA scan data analysis . Drug/placebo deliver principal investigator pharmacy service require . Statistical Analysis : This project look detect 2-3 % difference BMD DEXA scan compare individual ' baseline DEXA . Based previous data 11 power analysis achievable sample size 30 patient arm ( treatment vs. placebo ) ensure sufficient power ( Kalloger Consulting , Inc ) . Our initial analysis perform 30 patient randomize ( 15 FOSAVANCE , 15 placebo ) . Iif clear advantage demonstrate treatment group , trial complete treatment offer patient undergo chemotherapy gynecologic malignancy . If difference yet statistically significant favorable trend suggest enroll patient order sufficiently power series , specified goal detect 2-3 % difference BMD , consider clinical signficiance literature . Multiple parameter collect ( outline page 2 ) descriptive statistic bivariate analysis , test association osteoporosis clinicopathologic laboratory risk factor . These compare treatment control arm ensure group representative without potential confounding variable . Paired t-tests perform use statistical software ( SAS ) comparison baseline , 6 12-month BMD value , significance level 0.05 power 0.80 .</detailed_description>
