	<brief_summary>The objective study document pharmacokinetics adequacy DAT receptor occupancy d-MPH formulation three dos ( 20 mg , 30 mg , 40 mg ) use PET scan C-11 Altropane ligand across range time . It estimate MPH effective average CNS DAT occupancy 50 % great . Focalin XR show clinically effective analog classroom early 1 hour late 12 hour . Therefore , hypothesized average DAT occupancy adequate ( 50 % great ) time period correspond time clinical efficacy . The first objective examine onset action test whether average DAT occupancy adequate ( 50 % great ) 1 hour dose dose test ( 20 mg , 30 mg , 40 mg ) . The second objective test adequacy average DAT occupancy range later time dose . The time choose ( 8 , 10 12 hour ) correspond time Focalin XR show clinically effective analogue classroom study . A range time choose since , effective 12 hour , degree clinical effectiveness decrease late time period . The adequacy DAT occupancy across range time period provide important detail vivo molecular action medicine period critical clinical activity . The third exploratory objective examine time period later previously test high dose . Since clinical effectiveness Focalin XR test 14 hour , unknown whether effective 14 hour . If Focalin XR effective 14 hour would likely high dose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Dopamine Transporter Receptor Occupancy With Long-acting Dex-methylphenidate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stimulants show effective treatment Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) . [ 1 ] Studies show full day treatment often preferable short treatment [ 2 ] recent guideline advise full day treatment . [ 3 ] However , many barrier give multiple dos short act medicine . New delivery system evolve overcome tachyphylaxis provide effective long-acting treatment single pill . [ 4 ] One new formulation spheroidal oral drug absorption system ( SODAS ) . SODAS consist capsule two type bead 1 1 ratio . One type bead provide immediate release methylphenidate ( IR MPH ) , type bead consist MPH coat polymer delay release 4 hour . SODAS MPH show effective clinical study [ 5 ] . However , mechanism action remain unclear . While pharmacokinetic study show double pulse profile serum [ 4 ] , central nervous system pharmacokinetics unknown . Understanding central nervous system pharmacokinetic property critical new drug development ADHD , especially drug different lengths action . The d-MPH form show active enantiomer MPH . Studies show duration action d-MPH longer racemic MPH . Clinical study day d-MPH demonstrate efficacy child , adolescent adult ADHD . Understanding central nervous system pharmacokinetic property SODAS formulation longer-acting ( ) enantiomer provide critical knowledge mechanism action . The main target MPH brain dopamine transporter ( DAT ) [ 6 ] . There exquisitely sensitive methodology measure DAT occupancy use C-11 Altropane Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) [ 7 ] . The time course decay C-11 Altropane permit repeat imaging , thus allow documentation pharmacokinetics DAT receptor occupancy . A group Massachusetts General Hospital previously document central nervous system pharmacokinetics several psychiatric drug use similar technique [ 8-12 ] . To end , protocol seek document pharmacokinetics DAT receptor occupancy d-MPH use PET C-11 Altropane . It estimate MPH effective CNS DAT occupancy 50 % great . This aim study measure CNS DAT occupancy extend time point administration d-MPH . This research provide novel unique information toward good understanding mechanism action long-acting stimulant formulation enable new drug development .</detailed_description>
