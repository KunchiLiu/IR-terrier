	<brief_summary>Marfan syndrome genetic disease connective tissue , provide material support skeleton , muscle , blood vessel part body . People Marfan syndrome may tall thin slender , taper finger , long arm leg , spine curvature . They often heart eye problem . In patient , condition mild person symptom . Others always risk life-threatening problem , usually involve damage valve heart weaken large blood vessel lead heart . If blood vessel become weak , balloon ( dilate ) break ( rupture ) , might cause person die suddenly . We limit ability stop progression disease Marfan syndrome . Typically use medicine lower heart rate blood pressure ( ) . But prevent disease drug work well enough keep patient need surgery die suddenly blood vessel torn open . Our objective study two medicine see one , , improve blood vessel function patient Marfan syndrome . One ( Atenolol ) belong group drug call beta blocker often use treat high blood pressure . It common drug currently use treat patient Marfan syndrome . The ( Losartan ) also use high blood pressure , work different way . This study help u find good way treat people Marfan syndrome identify early change blood vessel function may help prevent long-term complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective propose research conduct randomize , double-blind superiority feasibility study compare effect two type medication ( Losartan , Angiotensin Receptor Blocker , Atenolol , beta blocker ) vascular function patient Marfan syndrome ( MFS ) . Our outcome include measure pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) biophysical property aorta two group patient . This study provide essential pilot data development logistics enable full multi-centre randomize control trial test hypothesis Losartan improve vascular function , long-term , slow rate aortic root dilation . MFS inherit disorder affect 1:5000 population ( i.e. , 6000 people ) Canada alone . In MFS , mutation FBN1 gene lead production abnormal fibrillin 1 connective tissue abnormality impair skeletal , ocular , pulmonary , importantly , cardiovascular system . Cardiovascular complication also relate endothelial dysfunction , widespread implication health large muscular blood vessel effect blood pressure , thrombosis , cholesterol level general vascular homeostasis . In MFS , progressive dilation , dissection rupture aortic root may occur . This dilation solely due primary abnormality collagen cause abnormal fibrillin protein . It remain unclear vascular mechanism cause dilation aortic root . Eventual aortic rupture major cause sudden death MFS . If untreated , MFS significantly shorten lifespan affected individual : half succumb late 20 early 30 , usually aortic rupture . As , crucial develop effective treatment cardiovascular disease MFS improve ability detect critical change blood vessel ( aortic ) structure function . Clinical management cardiovascular disease individual MFS aim decrease rate aortic root dilation reduce risk dissection rupture . Beta blocker ( eg . Atenolol ) traditional medical treatment although study cite success calcium antagonists angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , However , beta blocker treatment successful reduce rate dilation aorta , complication MFS , study report inconsistent response treatment one pediatric study show benefit beta blocker well result ACE inhibitor . Thus , still unclear whether one pharmacological agent improve outcomes regard aortic dilation rupture . Recently , individual MFS show dysregulation transform growth factor beta ( TGF-beta ) signal postulate result enlarge aortic root manifestation disease . Conversely , disorder TGF beta 1 2 receptor show produce Marfan phenotype . A study use Marfan mouse model find Losartan , angiotensin 2 AT1 receptor blocker , prevent development aortic root dilation phenotypic manifestation syndrome . Among action Losartan prevention increase level TGF beta effect stimulation production extracellular matrix vascular smooth muscle . This evidence suggest agent alter TGF beta signalling , Losartan , might significant potential ameliorate endothelial dysfunction aortic dilation MFS . A clinical trial compare effect Losartan current standard treatment regimen ( beta blocker ) need . Ultimately , even treat individual suffer aortic dilation , surgical repair dilate aortic root definitive MFS . Elective surgery carry low mortality significantly improve life expectancy ; contrast , emergency surgery aortic root dissection rupture carry much high mortality . Our early clinical study recent work Marfan mouse model study suggest aortic root dilation later stage disease process , involve cellular mechanism ( perhaps relate TGF beta ) aortic root dilation occur . This suggest , research , one might enable clinician identify individual early stage vessel dilation and/or risk aortic rupture . If could improve capacity early diagnosis aortic root dilation , could intervene pre-clinical stage minimize incidence emergency surgery sudden death . Towards goal , group develop novel method assess biophysical property aorta standard Echo Doppler technique develop accurate measure PWV , consider important index vascular function . In patient MFS , demonstrate increase pulse wave velocity , reduce distensibility , increase stiffness large central artery , endothelial dysfunctionâ€”even aortic root yet dilate ( see append paper ) . On basis study , also give access proprietary GE software analyze raw data develop software program analyse Doppler pulse flow external carotid artery pressure trace raw data obtain parameter previously require invasive technique laborious manual technique calculate . Using new technique , unique group applicable condition affect aorta , measure several key variable aortic vessel function , include vascular distensibility , stiffness index , impedance , total arterial compliance , reflective wave index , leave ventricular work efficiency . We predict use method make comprehensive assessment aortic vascular ( dy ) function provide early detection vascular change enable improved comparison effectiveness pharmacological treatment cardiovascular disease MFS . Therefore , objective propose research use methodology compare aortic vascular function individual MFS conventional treatment use beta blocker ( Atenolol ) angiotensin receptor blocker ( Losartan ) . We propose randomize , prospective , double-blinded superiority study compare action Losartan Atenolol vascular function group 30 patient MFS . Our research group unique capability perform analysis vascular effect therapy . The Specific Aims follow : 1 . To determine whether 12 month treatment Losartan decrease PWV 12 month treatment Atenolol cohort patient MFS ; 2 . To determine whether 12 month treatment Losartan improve index distensibility , stiffness , arterial compliance , impedances endothelial function 12 month treatment Atenolol cohort patient MFS ; 3 . To determine whether 12 month treatment Losartan slow progression aortic root dilation compare 12 month treatment Atenolol cohort patient MFS .</detailed_description>
