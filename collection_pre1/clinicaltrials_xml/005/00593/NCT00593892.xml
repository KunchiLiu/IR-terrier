	<detailed_description>There still debate concern appropriate timing stabilization long bone fracture patient thoracic trauma2 . While surgeon agree definitive stabilization within 24 hour injury optimal , sometimes possible wise . When early definitive stabilization possible , difference accept practice European North American surgeon . European surgeon prefer wait five day definitive treatment , cite literature Pape6 concern increase incidence pulmonary complication multi-system organ failure ( MOF ) purport high patient undergo stabilization two four day window . Pape postulate may part due `` second hit '' inflammatory system . He cite increase IL-6 TNFÎ± patient operate window . North American surgeon tend operate whenever felt patient stable enough undergo surgical stabilization trauma surgery standpoint . Much less emphasis place `` second hit '' etiology multi-system organ failure . More emphasis country place fat embolism theory MOF . There several flaw European literature leave North American surgeon unconvinced delay well population . First , Pape 's large retrospective study report 4313 patient treat 1975 1999 take account dramatic change management critically ill patient occur time interval . The conclusion patient treat later study concept `` damage control orthopaedics '' may better outcome improved ventilatory resuscitative technique , rather time secondary surgery . In another study , make conclusion patient operated day two four bad outcome operate four day . Patients poor outcome also correlate elevated IL-6 level admission . This study prospective cohort study patient select early versus delay treatment base convenience get operate room patient 's general condition . This study control surgical procedure may perform time period study . While compel , study repeat use randomize control . There considerable literature1,4,7-10 suggests MOF relate inflammatory mediate chain event . Most inflammatory marker elevate trauma , IL-6 seem one may prime importance cascade event . It show surgery many kind increase IL-6 level . Furthermore , evidence genetic predisposition3,5 toward produce high level cytokine . In pilot study perform UAB , find increase risk develop multisystem organ failure patient undergo long bone fracture fixation compare undergoing type surgery . Because rapid processing require initial blood draw ( within 1 - 2 hour injury ) allow optimize analysis , utmost importance research team allow immediately collect process remnant routine blood draw ER trauma patient . This may occur prior consent process . Should patient refuse give consent active blood collection , sample use initial processing sanitize identify information discard appropriate manner . After initial blood sample processing , prior analysis perform sample , patient consent permission collect blood sample daily hospital hospital day 7 . During time , single vial blood collect stored day . Concurrently , patient data demographic data , medical record number , mechanism injury , list surgery correspond surgical data type , time length surgery collect encrypted database . After approximately 100 patient enrol , examine database select age , sex injury severity score-matched patient include analysis blood sample . These blood sample run cytokine use commercially-available cytokine panel SNP panel ( single-nucleotide polymorphism ) determine patient hyper-responder cytokine production . These sample statistically analyzed determine genetic profile ( SNP ) predict cytokine response secondarily predict change daily cytokine level base type surgery patient .</detailed_description>
