	<brief_title>Temsirolimus Combination With Gemcitabine Previously Untreated Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Because study determine high dos temsirolimus gemcitabine give safely together , group 3 subject treat gradually increase dos drug . Each group 3 subject must complete 4 week treatment ( 1 cycle ) follow group 3 subject start treatment high dose drug . - Temsirolimus give intravenously every week 28 day treatment cycle ( day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ) . Gemcitabine give intravenously every week treatment cycle ( day 1 . 15 ) . - During study , participant weekly clinic visit follow test procedure may perform : Physical exam ; vital sign ; urine test ; blood test . - A CT scan perform every 2 cycle ( 8 week ) assess teh response tumor study treatment .</detailed_description>
