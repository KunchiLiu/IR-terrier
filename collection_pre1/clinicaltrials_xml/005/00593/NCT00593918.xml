	<brief_title>Innate Immunity Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) Infection Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infection RSV common cause respiratory tract illness ( LRIs ) first 3 year life . There significant social health care cost associate RSV-LRIs . More 3 % US child hospitalize year due RSV 500 die annually . Several longitudinal study also suggest child RSV-LRIs substantially increase risk develop asthma first 3 year infection bronchial hyperresponsiveness ( BHR ) many year primary infection . Mechanisms involve RSV disease well understood . Recent report suggest RSV may initiate innate immune response pattern recognition receptor , Toll like receptor-4 ( TLR4 ) . In project study capacity single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) TLR4 gene induce vary level inflammatory chemokine cytokine production . It suggest mechanism may result alter immune response RSV infection different clinical outcome . This research direct application improve understanding bronchiolitis early childhood , particularly factor influence severity disease , may implications possible therapy patient bronchiolitis future .</detailed_description>
