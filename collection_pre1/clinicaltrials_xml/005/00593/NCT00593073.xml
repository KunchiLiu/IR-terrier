	<brief_summary>Effective program need overcome barrier CRC screen among person rural community . There good evidence suggest program employing patient activation tailor address specific concern individual effective model address CRC screen underutilization rural resident . In study , propose test model among rural primary care patient , group , date , receive little attention . We also bolster tailor message traditionally conduct use tailored informational flyer format use physician message source increase message saliency . This study help assess relatively low-cost , disseminable technology effectively circumvent `` system problem '' endemic rural primary care . This project lay groundwork practice base research network clinic future intervention study operationalize office community-based technology help rural primary care patient make informed health decision engage healthy lifestyle behavior .</brief_summary>
