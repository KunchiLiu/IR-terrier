	<brief_summary>Over past two decade , breast conserving therapy ( BCT ) become major treatment modality Stage I II breast carcinoma . The major advantage breast conserve therapy superior cosmetic outcome reduce emotional psychological trauma afford procedure compare conventional mastectomy . The principal disadvantage BCT complex prolong treatment regimen require approximately 6 week external beam radiation therapy pose problem patient work woman , elderly patient , live significant distance treatment center . These factor , along patient 's geographic location , result small fraction patient currently meet eligibility criterion BCT actually receive , despite cosmetic probable psychological advantage . The logistical problem BCT primarily relate protracted course external beam radiation therapy whole breast . While investigator report believe acceptable local control rate carefully select patient treat wide local excision without radiation therapy , criterion patient selection controversial poorly define probably restrict access many patient breast conserve therapy . If previous observation valid breast irradiation follow tylectomy exerts maximal effect eradicate occult disease remain immediate vicinity tylectomy site , radiation therapy direct tissue surround excision cavity breast , use brachytherapy alone ? If , entire course radiation therapy could deliver 4 7 day period immediately follow tylectomy and/or axillary dissection , thus markedly reduce treatment time . Brachytherapy also inherently provide high central dose volume risk recurrence . Cosmetic outcome use brachytherapy boost external whole breast radiotherapy comparable slightly inferior electron beam boost radiation therapy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study evaluate local control , cosmetic result , quality life , complication rate brachytherapy use sole method radiation therapy patient stage 0 , I , II carcinoma breast treat tylectomy , histologically assess negative surgical margin , N0 axillary node .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>AJCC stage 0 , I , II ( TisN0 , T1N0 , T2N0 = 3 cm ) histologically confirm carcinoma breast , treat tylectomy . Axillary sampling require case invasive cancer . Tumor size determine pathologist . Clinical size may use pathologic size indeterminate . Signed studyspecific inform consent participation study . Negative , close negative , inked histologic margin tylectomy reexcision specimen confirm prior placing brachytherapy catheter . Margins generally positive invasive noninvasive tumor ink resection margin , close negative tumor within 2 mm ink margin negative tumor least 2 mm away inked edge . Negative posttylectomy postreexcision mammography cancer present malignancyassociated microcalcifications ; remain suspicious microcalcifications breast brachytherapy . For patient invasive cancer , positive axillary lymph node least 6 axillary lymph node sample negative sentinel node . Invasive ductal , lobular , medullary , papillary , colloid ( mucinous ) , tubular histology . Noninvasive ductal carcinoma situ . Chemotherapy hormonal therapy plan = 2 week removal brachytherapy catheter permit . Hormonal therapy allow brachytherapy treat radiation oncologist 's decision . Negative pregnancy test premenopausal patient intact uterus Patients distant metastasis . Patients insitu lobular carcinoma nonepithelial breast malignancy sarcoma lymphoma . Patients proven multicentric carcinoma ( tumor different quadrant breast , tumor separate least 4 cm ) clinically radiographically suspicious area ipsilateral breast unless confirm negative malignancy biopsy . Patients pregnant lactate . Patients histologically confirm positive axillary node ipsilateral axilla . Palpable radiographically suspicious contralateral axillary , supraclavicular , infraclavicular , internal mammary node , unless histologic confirmation node negative tumor . Prior nonhormonal therapy present breast cancer , include radiation therapy chemotherapy . Patients systemic lupus erythematosis , scleroderma , dermatomyositis CPK level normal active skin rash . Patients coexist medical condition life expectancy &lt; 2 year . Patients psychiatric addictive disorder would preclude obtain informed consent complete full series high dose rate brachytherapy treatment outpatient basis . Patients Paget 's disease nipple . Patients skin involvement , regardless tumor size . Patients breast unsatisfactory brachytherapy . For example , little breast tissue remain skin pectoralis muscle surgery , placement catheter technically problematic . Patients tylectomies extensive cosmetic result fair poor prior brachytherapy . Surgical margin microscopically assess positive pathological evaluation . Any previously treat contralateral breast carcinoma synchronous bilateral breast carcinoma . Other malignancy , except nonmelanoma skin cancer , â‰¤ 5 year prior participation study ; disease free interval prior carcinoma must continuous . Time final definitive breast procedure radioactive source load brachytherapy catheter great 8 week . Patients diffuse ( &gt; 1 quadrant &gt; 5 cm diameter ) suspicious microcalcifications . Patients suspicious microcalcifications remain posttylectomy mammogram</criteria>
