	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether gentamicin-collagen sponge combine standard daily wound care safe effective treat mildly infect skin ulcer compare treatment oral antibiotic ( levofloxacin ) standard daily wind care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Antibiotic Sponge Diabetic Patients With Mild Infection Foot Ulcer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infected skin ulcer patient diabetes debilitate difficult heal . Diabetic ulcer responsible frequent health care visit , major predictor amputation . Diabetic ulcer cause patient 's inability sense pain warmth well peripheral vascular disease , cause diminished blood flow foot . Early aggressive treatment necessary treat infection prevent need amputation . Gentamicin antibiotic effective treat certain kind infection . Collagen protein find mammal . The gentamicin-collagen sponge thin flat sponge make collagen come cow tendon contain gentamicin . When applied open ulcer , collagen break gentamicin release ulcer , little absorbed blood stream . The high level gentamicin open infect ulcer may help treat infection . In study , subject give necessary supply teach take care foot ulcer . Subjects randomly assign gentamicin-collagen sponge treatment group place gentamicin-collagen sponge ulcer daily wound care . Subjects randomly assign oral levofloxacin treatment group also perform daily wind care , give gentamicin-collagen sponge . Instead give antibiotic , levofloxacin take mouth treatment period .</detailed_description>
