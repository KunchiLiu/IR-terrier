	<brief_title>A Controlled Trial High Dietary Fiber Intake Serum Lipids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dietary fiber intake show modest effect lower cholesterol . However , study do 20g/daily fiber intake . Not much know high dietary fiber intake ( 30-40 g/day ) serum cholesterol . Also , small study show modest decrease oxidative stress increase dietary fiber intake . The goal study determine efficacy /safety high dietary fiber intake raise HDL , lower LDL , lower oxidative stress patient hyperlipidemia .</detailed_description>
