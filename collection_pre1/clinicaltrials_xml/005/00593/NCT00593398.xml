	<detailed_description>Plasmodium falciparum malaria one three major infectious disease world today . Infants endemic area bear transplacentally-acquired antibody ( Ab ) help protect severe infection . Once passive-immunity wane , infant become susceptible severe disease . Asymptomatic clinical malaria common pregnant woman , create health problem mother develop fetus . Malaria increase maternal anemia , mortality parturition risk low birth weight ( LBW ) baby . This study plan enroll total 1,160 pregnant woman , age 15 50 year , include 920 pregnant woman reside city Yaounde 240 woman reside rural village Ngali II Ntouessong . In addition , 216 baby bear reside Ngali II Ntouessong enrol . Women receive physical exam , participate blood sample collection , follow monthly pregnancy . Participants receive sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine ( SP ) every month term , recommend World Health Organization ( WHO ) . During 2nd 3rd visit , pregnant woman ask provide stool sample detection intestinal parasite . At delivery , follow collect : 2-3 cc maternal venous blood , information newborn , biopsy placenta histology , blood intervillous space placenta ( IVS ) cytokine , fetal cord blood Ab prim T B cell . To determine malarial infection 2nd 3rd trimester influence malarial infection infant , mother study well additional mother receive Intermittent Preventive Therapy ( IPT ) -SP 2nd 3rd trimester woman receive less recommended dose recruit last trimester pregnancy ask enroll newborn . The level antimalarial cellular humoral immunity birth record infant . The newborn follow determine 1st become positive P. falciparum number severity infection . In addition , decline maternal Ab acquisition Ab ( IgM IgG ) infants vaccine-candidate antigen ( Ag ) monitor throughout 1st year use blood sample collect monthly . The goal study determine absence malaria 2nd 3rd trimester ( due use IPT ) following : alters development pregnancy-associated immunity mother ; reduces placental pathology ; increase susceptibility baby malaria . The primary outcome measure determine : delivery , proportion primigravida Ab variant antigen identify Salanti ( VAR2csa ) significantly reduce pregnant woman infect 3rd trimester pregnancy ; prevalence presence severe pathology compare among group ; number baby malaria first 6 month life . The secondary outcome measure study include : determining maternal P. falciparum infection 2nd 3rd trimester reduces transfer malaria-specific IgG fetus ; determine proportion baby bear prim T cell whose mother malaria 2nd 3rd trimester compare ; presence prim B cell cord blood detect culture cord blood mononuclear cell MNC vitro culture 5 day ; plasma collected baby experience 1st P. falciparum infection screen presence IgG IgM Abs panel Ag . The duration entire study 5 year .</detailed_description>
