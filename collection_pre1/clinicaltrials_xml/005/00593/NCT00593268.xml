	<brief_summary>In project collect cerebrospinal fluid blood patient Vanderbilt Medical Center subarachnoid hemorrhage follow rupture brain aneurysm . We propose study cerebrospinal fluid use novel microscopic laser directed mass spectrometric analysis ( MALDI ) available Vanderbilt . The cerebrospinal fluid blood analyse different biological marker , protein expression gene expression . These marker statistically correlate clinical data include prediction vasospasm , time vasospasm response standard therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In project collect cerebrospinal fluid blood patient Vanderbilt Medical Center subarachnoid hemorrhage follow rupture brain aneurysm . We propose study cerebrospinal fluid use novel microscopic laser directed mass spectrometric analysis ( MALDI ) available Vanderbilt . The cerebrospinal fluid blood analyse different biological marker , protein expression gene expression . These marker statistically correlate clinical data include prediction vasospasm , time vasospasm response standard therapy . The goal study determine cerebrospinal fluid serum marker predictive vasospasm . This turn may lead improve outcomes population patient . The data compare excess cerebrospinal fluid collect patient undergo lumbar puncture Neurology Clinic excess cerebrospinal fluid patient undergo cranial surgery cause like tumor excision . For patient enrol study , cerebrospinal fluid collect either lumbar puncture external ventricular catheter . Specimens collect immediately pre-operatively external ventricular drain place intraoperatively external ventricular drain present . We also collect cerebrospinal fluid post operatively placement external ventricular drain regularly excess cerebrospinal fluid collect drainage bag . CSF collect serial fashion multiple time point : immediately post operatively , vasospasm external ventricular drain remove .</detailed_description>
