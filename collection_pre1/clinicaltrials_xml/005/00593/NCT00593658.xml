	<brief_summary>The Hepatopulmonary syndrome ( HPS ) result intrapulmonary microvascular dilatation impairs arterial oxygenation set cirrhosis portal hypertension . As many 10-20 % cirrhotics evaluate orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLT ) advance HPS mortality great HPS without HPS . Currently , OLT effective treatment , although post-operative mortality HPS increase relative cirrhotic patient without HPS , one-year survival 68-80 % . Therefore , effective medical therapy advance HPS could improve pre-operative post-operative mortality . Recent work experimental model HPS reveal nitric oxide synthase-derived nitric oxide heme oxygenase-derived carbon monoxide cause intrapulmonary vasodilatation . These alteration appear driven part TNF-α modulation pulmonary blood flow intravascular monocyte accumulation . Pentoxifylline nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor inhibitory effect TNF-α recently show beneficial patient severe alcoholic hepatitis TNF-α overproduction contribute liver injury . In experimental HPS , pentoxifylline administration also decrease severity oxygenation abnormality . However , pentoxifylline therapy associate dose limit side effect patient liver disease tolerability pentoxifylline cirrhotic patient advance HPS unknown . Therefore , open label single arm clinical trial design evaluate efficacy tolerability 8 week pentoxifylline cirrhotic patient advance HPS consider OLT .</brief_summary>
