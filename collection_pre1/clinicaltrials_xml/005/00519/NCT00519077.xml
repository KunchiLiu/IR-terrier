	<brief_title>Phase II Study Skin Toxicity Dosing IRESSA ( Gefitinib ) Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multi-institution , phase II study evaluate activity gefitinib individually escalate dos 750mg achieve skin toxicity grade great equal 2 . Patients start gefitinib 250mg orally daily 2 week . At 2 week , patient reevaluate give skin toxicity grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 ( CTC 3.0 ) . Patients grade 2 great skin toxicity remain 250 mg daily ; patient grade 0-1 skin toxicity dose escalate 500 mg daily 750 mg daily next evaluation grade 2 great skin toxicity develop . The protocol later amend report low efficacy 250 mg dose patient start 500 mg per day . There dose escalation beyond 750 mg per day irrespective response grade skin toxicity . Therapy discontinue upon disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , death patient 's withdrawal consent . Dose interruption use first approach manage toxicity patient experience grade 3-4 non-hematological toxicity . Gefitinib interrupt maximum 14 day toxicity drop grade 1 less . Adherence therapy monitor use drug diary collect physician visit assess pill count .</detailed_description>
