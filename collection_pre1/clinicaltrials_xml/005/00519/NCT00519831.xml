	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , vinflunine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Others interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving vinflunine together cetuximab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give vinflunine together cetuximab work second-line therapy treat patient stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph II Vinflunine Cetuximab Second Line Treatment NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Estimate objective response rate patient receive vinflunine cetuximab second-line therapy stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer . Secondary - Determine progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - Determine safety regimen patient . - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine duration overall response patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive vinflunine IV 15-20 minute day 1 cetuximab IV 60-120 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients respond disease may receive additional course beyond 4 course discretion principal investigator . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 6 month .</detailed_description>
