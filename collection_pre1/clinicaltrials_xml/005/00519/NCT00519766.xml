	<brief_title>Examining New Biomarker Nicotine Use Among Pregnant Women Who Participated New England SCRIPT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According one source 2004 data , approximately 13 % pregnant woman report smoke last 3 month pregnancy . This major public health concern smoke pregnancy lead pregnancy complication serious health problem newborn , include 50 % increase risk low birth weight . The effect tobacco exposure infant birth weight may long-term consequence , fetal growth appear predictor coronary heart disease later life . Pregnant woman participate clinical trial less likely disclose smoke desire please study researcher . Therefore , way test nicotine exposure need accurately determine number pregnant woman smoke number woman quit smoke pregnancy . A new biomarker nicotine metabolism , ratio trans-3'-hydroxycotinine cotinine ( 3-HC : C ) , may accurate estimate nicotine exposure tobacco . Trans-3'-hydroxycotinine cotinine byproduct nicotine excrete urine . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness 3-HC : C ratio measure prenatal tobacco smoke exposure first third trimester pregnancy examine use 3-HC : C ratio relation infant birth weight . In addition , change 3-HC : C metabolism pregnancy analyze accord different racial ethnic group . This study enroll pregnant woman participate New England SCRIPT study , draw predominately low-income , multi-ethnic population . There study visit specifically study . Study researcher analyze participant ' SCRIPT study data four survey collect baseline , third trimester , 6 week 6 month follow childbirth . Researchers analyze follow study data : smoking behavior , attitude toward smoke , self-reported smoking status , number cigarette smoke per day , use assign smoke cessation material , infant birth weight . Demographic information , include participant 's age , race ethnicity , year education , age fetus study entry , smoke practice household member , also examine . Urine sample collect participant SCRIPT study analyze 3-HC : C biomarker . This current study use new technique , liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure ionization tandem spectrometry , measure cotinine hydroxycotinine level urine sample .</detailed_description>
