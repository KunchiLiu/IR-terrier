	<brief_summary>We hypothesize combination tegafur/uracil ( UFUR ) thalidomide , show active HCC patient , may highly useful regimen treatment advance HCC . There several rationale underlie combination . First , anti-angiogenesis therapy may improve efficacy chemotherapy normalize abnormal vasculature tumor , thus improve delivery chemotherapeutic agent tumor cell . Second , chemotherapeutic drug give low-dose , un interrupt , protracted way induce anti-tumor effect anti-angiogenesis activity ( so-called '' metronomic chemotherapy '' ) . The efficacy metronomic chemotherapy suppress VEGF/VEGFR signal pathway thus bo potentiated agent block survival signal endothelial cell . In regard , tegafur/uracil appear good candidate metronomic chemotherapy tegafur/uracil metabolite bave already show inhibit angiogenesis several pre-clinical model .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>UFUR Plus Thalidomide Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thalidomide , glutamic acid derivative first develop 1950s , market sedative , tranquilizer , antiemetic morning sickness . It withdraw European Canadian market early 1960s teratogenic effect . In recent year , thalidomide emerge novel treatment cancer anti-angiogenic property . The clinical efficacy demonstrate various type human cancer , include HCC . Tegafur uracil composite drug , market UFT® Japan market UFUR® Taiwan . Tegafur , prodrug 5-FU , easily absorb though gastrointestinal tract slowly metabolize 5-FU mainly liver . Uracil inhibitor dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) , rate-limiting enzyme 5-FU degradation . Therefore , tegafur/uracil expect maintain stably high concentration liver circulation . Tegafur/uracil approve indication advance gastric cancer colorectal cancer . In several phase II study conduct Japan , tegafur/uracil induce response rate 0 17 % advanced HCC patient . We hypothesize combination tegafur/uracil thalidomide , show active HCC patient , may highly useful regimen treatment advance HCC . There several rationale underlie combination . First , anti-angiogenesis therapy may improve efficacy chemotherapy normalize abnormal vasculature tumor , thus improve delivery chemotherapeutic agent tumor cell . Second , chemotherapeutic drug give low-dose , un-interrupted , protracted way induce anti-neoplasm effect anti-angiogenesis activity . What so-called `` metronomic chemotherapy '' base direct target activation , growth , proliferation vascular endothelial cell cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent . The anti-angiogenesis effect metronomic chemotherapy suppress VEGF/VEGFR signal pathway thus potentiate agent block survival signal endothelial cell . In regard , tegafur/uracil appear good candidate metronomic chemotherapy tegafur/uracil metabolites already show inhibit angiogenesis several pre-clinical model . The combination tegafur/uracil thalidomide clinical advantage patient HCC . Both drug orally active , thus convenient give out-patient basis . More importantly , low non-overlapping toxicity profile two drug make combination relatively safe patient HCC .</detailed_description>
