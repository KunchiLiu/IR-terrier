	<detailed_description>In Europe approximately 5 % acute medical admission relate heart failure United States heart failure responsible almost 1 million hospitalization annually . Almost three quarter admission unplanned worsen heart failure responsible half admission . The Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry ( ADHERE ) show hospital treatment heart failure frequently follow publish guideline conform Joint Commission Accreditation Healthcare Organizations ( JCAHO ) core performance measure , potentially contribute high morbidity , mortality economic cost disorder . ADHERE finding also suggest wide variation conformity may reflect difference train , guideline familiarity , implementation tool system ensure recommend care provide document . Consequently development educational quality improvement program potential considerably reduce current variability care , enhance guideline adherence , improve outcome patient . Clinical pathways become popular tool achieve goal . Clinical pathway methodology mutual decision make organization care well-defined group patient well-defined period aim enhance quality care improve patient outcome , promote patient safety , increase patient satisfaction , optimize use resource . They also develop multi-professional team . Despite enthusiasm diffusion , widespread acceptance clinical pathway remain questionable little prospective control data demonstrate effectiveness . The Experimental Prospective Study Effectiveness Efficiency Implementation Clinical Pathways design order conduct rigorous evaluation clinical pathway hospital treatment decompensated heart failure .</detailed_description>
