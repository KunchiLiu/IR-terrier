	<brief_summary>This investigator initiate study , single-blinded , parallel , randomized study conduct subject 2 keloid similar size duration similar area body . The response closure technique evaluate clinical instrumental assessment . Each qualify subject assessed keloid randomly assign Clozex suture closure . One keloid surgically excise surgical wound generate randomize closed Clozex . A second keloid surgically excise surgical wound generate randomize closed suture . The inflammation index keloid recurrence rate surgical wound closure site compare .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Clinical Study Comparing Two Closure Techniques Excised Keloids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study undertaken compare efficacy two closure technique excise keloid . ( 1 ) Clozex , non-latex , hypoallergenic adhesive polymeric interlace film design adhere proximal wound edge 7-10 day , use punch biopsy excision keloid ( 2 ) suture close similar second keloid punch biopsy excision keloid . On day 12 , investigator subject ass keloid site ( ) use visual analog scale . There optional follow-up 3 month 6 month assess recurrence keloid effectiveness treatment visual analog scale . The subject ass keloid site ( ) use follow visual analog scale : 1 . Cosmetic appearance 2 . Pain 3 . Tenderness 4 . Itching 5 . Oozing 6 . Redness 7 . Warmth The investigator ass keloid site ( ) use visual analog scale : 1 . Global appearance 2 . Color 3 . Matte/Shiny 4 . Contour 5 . Distortion 6 . Texture 7 . Oozing 8 . Redness 9 . Warmth 10 . Firmness</detailed_description>
