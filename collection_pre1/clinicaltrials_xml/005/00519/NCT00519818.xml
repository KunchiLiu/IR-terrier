	<brief_summary>This study test new , extended release form hydrocortisone call Chronocort patient congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH ) . People CAH make enough adrenal hormone cortisol aldosterone , adrenal gland make much sex hormone androgen . Medicines call glucocorticoid ( hydrocortisone , dexamethasone prednisone ) currently use treat CAH , find best dose drug effectively lower androgen without cause undesirable side effect , weight gain slow growth rate child , often difficult achieve . Adolescents adults CAH due 21-hydroxylase deficiency may eligible study . Children 16 year age old eligible confirmation bone age longer grow . Participants undergo follow test procedure two inpatient visit one month apart NIH Clinical Center : - Medical history physical examination . - Medications : Following 7 day Cortef ( standard drug treatment CAH ) , patient begin take Chronocort day 3 hospitalization continue tablet day 1 month . - Blood test : A catheter ( plastic tube ) insert vein leave place frequent blood draw order avoid repeat needlesticks . Blood drawn chemistry , blood count , pregnancy test woman , serial test ( 26 sample 24-hour period ) measure hormone level . - 24-hour urine test . - Height weight measurement . Between two hospitalization , patient contact NIH weekly check possible side effect Chronocort . Two week first visit , patient also blood drawn regular doctor local clinic . A day second hospitalization , patient undergo 20-minute telephone questionnaire energy level well . About 30 day discharge second hospitalization , patient follow telephone call see .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Forms Hydrocortisone Patients With Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH ) due 21-hydroxylase deficiency disease adrenal cortex characterize cortisol deficiency without aldosterone deficiency , androgen excess . The severe classic form occur 1 15,000 birth worldwide , mild non-classic form common cause hyperandrogenism . The discovery glucocorticoid therapy treatment CAH occur 1950 's result patient classic CAH survive live normal lifespan . However , exist treatment suboptimal many unresolved clinical problem exist . Standard hormone replacement often fail normalize growth development child CAH , adult may experience iatrogenic Cushing syndrome , hyperandrogenism , infertility development metabolic syndrome . Chronocort , newly-developed formulation hydrocortisone , result slow release hydrocortisone design mimic normal cortisol circadian rhythm . This new medical strategy , physiologic cortisol replacement , offer prospect improve outcome treatment . Chronocort safely give healthy adult male pharmacokinetic study . This first ever study patient CAH pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study compare Chronocort Cortef , conventional immediate-release form hydrocortisone .</detailed_description>
