In short-term acute phase , sertraline initiate 25 mg , increase 50 mg day 3 , maintain day 14 . If patient show early response ( i.e . ≧ 20 % improvement MADRS total score baseline ) , sertraline continue titrated 50 - 100 mg base clinical judgment . On hand , patient show early response , randomly divide two group . In one group , sertraline continue titrated 50 - 100 mg , whereas group sertraline switch paroxetine . Paroxetine start 10 mg day 15 16 , increase 20 mg day 17 , increase weekly 10 mg week 4 ( i.e . day 22 ) , sertraline taper 25 mg day 15 16 . In case patient intolerant adverse event , achieve remission ( i.e . MADRS total score ≦ 8 ) , increase dose terminate . Lorazepam , lormetazepam , mosapride allow p.r.n . basis . In long-term follow-up phase week 8 , patient achieve remission response follow dose administer throughout . Assessments include MADRS , clinical global impression scale ( CGI ) , Quick Inventory Depressive Symptomatology self-reported ( QIDS-SR ) ( week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 ) .
