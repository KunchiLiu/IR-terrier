	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Treating Patients With Iodine-Refractory Recurrent Metastatic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate response sunitinib ( sunitinib malate ) per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion patient recurrent/metastatic iodine refractory well differentiate thyroid carcinoma ( WDTC ) medullary thyroid carcinoma ( MTC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate early positron emission tomography ( PET ) change patient WDTC MTC treat sunitinib . II . Determine safety toxicity sunitinib give continuous treatment patient WDTC MTC . III . Evaluate effect sunitinib therapy overall survival , duration response time-to-progression . IV . Evaluate serial tumor marker , thyroglobulin ( WDTC ) calcitonin ( MTC ) , therapy . These measurement use define disease progression response . V. Correlate change serial tumor marker radiologic response . OUTLINE : Patients receive sunitinib malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day 2 year .</detailed_description>
