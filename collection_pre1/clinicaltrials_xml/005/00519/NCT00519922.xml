	<brief_summary>This pilot study test test exercise training protocol large study desing phase may modify base finding study . Two exercise group compare ; one stadard treatment group use leg strength exercise commonly employ therapy clinic . The group balance agility type exercise , specific strength exercise . These `` KBA '' exercise increasingly common therapy clinic , little research conduct effectiveness treat knee osteoarthritis symptom . Participants study complete three short paper pencil test begin end study ( 8 week exercise ) well leg strength test , leg endurance test , two short walk test , stair climb/descend test . One paper pencil test take every two week effort see quickly change symptom might occur . The exercise program conduct 3 afternoon per week ( Mon-Wed-Fri ) lead ACSM certify instructor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Effectiveness Different Types Exercise People With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiographic knee OA present estimate 37 % Americans age 60 , represent 13 million people . Current medical , non-surgical knee OA treatment focus primarily symptomatic relief meet limited , temporary success . Various therapeutic exercise prescription use help ameliorate knee OA symptom improve function . Leg strength training commonly use . However , recent evidence suggest short program kinesthesia , balance agility ( KBA ) technique may result rapid symptom relief functional improvement comparison traditional therapeutic exercise . These early benefit could potentially lead great long term exercise adherence . In case study elderly female patient dynamic knee instability relate OA , physical therapist report success combination KBA train traditional therapeutic exercise . These finding need verify controlled clinical trial . This pilot study help determine proper test exercise training method large clinical trial , indicate KBA train do without concurrent strength training viable intervention . Research Hypothesis : Among men woman age 50 Kellgren Lawrence ( 1957 ) Grade 2 high symptomatic tibiofemoral OA one knee , 8-week , 3-day per week kinesthesia , balance &amp; agility ( KBA ) exercise program - design increase dynamic neuromuscular knee stability - safely effectively change physical function effectively standard leg strength training</detailed_description>
