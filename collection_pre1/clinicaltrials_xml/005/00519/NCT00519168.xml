	<brief_summary>Recent research provide evidence disrupt circadian rhythm , include hormonal pattern sleep , associate increase risk breast cancer incidence faster progression mortality . We observe loss normal diurnal cortisol rhythm associate awakening night predict early mortality metastatic breast cancer . Other recent study show nighttime shift work associate high breast cancer incidence , murine model disrupt circadian cortisol cycle produce double implanted tumor growth . There also recent evidence abnormal clock gene associate cancer . However , clear whether sleep disruption per se affect breast cancer progression , whether effect mediate hormonal immune dysregulation prevalent hormone-mediated cancer . We propose study sleep disruption prognostic factor progression metastatic breast cancer . We also examine sleep pattern association disrupt circadian rhythm cortisol , ACTH , melatonin well measure immune function know salient breast cancer progression . These natural killer cell cytoxicity specific cytokine , IL-6 . We plan recruit 105 woman 45 year 75 year metastatic recurrent breast cancer 20 age SES-matched control two-week home sleep study Actiwatch two night in-home EEG monitoring , follow 28 hour continuous blood sample one night EEG sleep monitoring lab Stanford . This provide full examination circadian hormone associate sleep pattern . We relate assessment subsequent course breast cancer progression . Results study provide specific evidence regard improve sleep management may affect course breast cancer . Aim 1 : To study 24-hr diurnal rhythm HPA axis hormone melatonin woman metastatic recurrent breast cancer . Hypothesis 1 : Women metastatic recurrent breast cancer reduce amplitude disrupt phase 24-hr diurnal rhythm cortisol , ACTH , melatonin . Aim 2 : To describe sleep disruption woman metastatic breast cancer examine psychosocial , endocrine , immune factor may associate sleep disruption . Hypothesis 2 : Women metastatic recurrent breast cancer high incidence home laboratory-examined sleep disruption control woman without breast cancer . Hypothesis 3 : Poorer sleep quality associate pain , emotional suppression response stressor , less emotional support , great depression anxiety , great perceive traumatic stress . Hypothesis 4 : Poorer sleep quality quantity sleep daytime sleepiness fatigue associate abnormal circadian neuroendocrine ( i.e. , cortisol , ACTH , melatonin ) immune pattern ( i.e. , suppress day night time NK activity loss NK rhythm ; increase day time IL-6 level /or loss IL-6 rhythm ) . Aim 3 : To study relationship sleep disruption survival time among metastatic recurrent breast cancer patient . Hypothesis 5 : Poorer sleep quality quantity sleep predict shorter survival . Hypothesis 6 : Reduced diurnal amplitude abnormal phase cortisol predict short survival . Explanatory Aim 4 : To investigate whether sleep disruption mediates relation psychosocial factor health outcome .</brief_summary>
