	<brief_summary>This study do find whether patient receive kidney transplant benefit take medication paricalcitol ( trade name Zemplar® ) compare kidney transplant recipient take medication . The main possible benefit study : - Lower risk overactive parathyroid glands kidney transplantation . - Lower risk low bone density spine hip kidney transplantation . By divide patient study group receive Zemplar® group receive Zemplar® , possible understand good bad effect Zemplar® first year kidney transplant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The significant challenge kidney transplantation present reduce risk long-term complication . This include hyperparathyroidism , common post kidney transplant complication contribute loss bone density fracture risk necessitate surgical intervention approximately 5 % kidney transplant patient . In order take part study already accept kidney transplantation live donor decease donor Mayo Clinic Rochester , Minnesota . After agree take part study put one two group chance ( flip coin ) : Group 1 ( Standard Treatment `` Control '' ) : Patients group receive combination four anti-rejection medication use Mayo Clinic Rochester many kidney transplant patient include research study medicine . These medication include : 1 . Alemtuzumab ( Campath® ) - medicine give intravenously ( IV ) day transplant surgery . 2 . Methylprednisolone ( Solumedrol® ) - medicine , part family medicine often refer corticosteroid , give intravenously day transplant surgery . This plan dose corticosteroid medicine receive although medicine tablet form call Prednisone may give late time episode transplant rejection . 3 . Mycophenolate Mofetil ( Cellcept® ) - medicine give mouth twice daily begin even transplant ( live donor transplant ) day transplant ( decease donor transplant ) . It continue long transplant unless medical reason stop . 4 . Tacrolimus ( Prograf® ) - medicine give mouth daily begin fourth day transplant . It continue long transplant unless medical reason stop . The dose adjust base blood test do twice week month long take medicine . Group 2 ( Zemplar® + Standard Treatment ) : Patients group receive combination anti-rejection medication patient Group 1 ( a-d ) plus Zemplar® , medicine study , also start day transplant . Zemplar® give capsule contain 1 microgram Zemplar® daily begin day transplant . It continue dose first two week , depend result blood urine testing , increase 2 microgram daily . The dose remain 2 microgram daily end study unless medical reason reduce stop unless study stop early . Both group patient treat team doctor , nurse nurse coordinator care kidney transplant patient Mayo Clinic . The procedure treatment transplant recommend Mayo Clinic patient receive kidney transplant . These include surgical operation carry transplant ; need take anti-rejection medicine mouth rest life ; need blood urine test regular interval rest life monitor progress transplant ; recommendation biopsy transplant carry three occasion first two year transplant surgery . These procedure potential complication describe detail transplant physician , transplant surgeon , transplant coordinator . The study require extra hospital outpatient visit compare usual care kidney transplant patient Mayo Clinic Rochester .</detailed_description>
