	<brief_summary>This study do : To attempt increase detection precancerous colon tissue patient chronic ulcerative colitis primary sclerosing cholangitis ; To determine investigational scope look line colon different way help doctor identify abnormal tissue patient chronic ulcerative colitis concurrent primary sclerosing cholangitis ; To determine investigational scope accurately detect precancerous cancerous tissue patient chronic ulcerative colitis know cancerous precancerous tissue past .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compare Conventional Colonosocpy Endoscopic AFI , NBI Dysplasia Detection Ulcerative Colitis &amp; Cholangitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients concurrent chronic ulcerative colitis primary sclerosing cholangitis patient chronic ulcerative colitis know colorectal dysplasia cancer , present surveillance colonoscopy recruit . After give informed consent patient undergo colonoscopy segmental fashion . Colonoscopy white light perform cecum examination perform withdrawal . First conventional white light use examine cecum ascend colon random biopsy obtain . All endoscopically apparent lesion biopsied separately . Immediately follow examination segment cecum ascend colon AFI first , NBI target biopsy suspicious area take . The AFI NBI modality achieve simply flip switch.. If necessary , wash ooze blood random biopsy sit performed. , The remainder colon assess like fashion : transverse , descend rectosigmoid . Because high definition endoscopy default modality , use throughout procedure . All lesion detect document biopsied maximum four biopsy per suspicious lesion . Note take modality result visualization lesion . Data factor study collect : ) disease type ( CUC + PSC CUC known dysplasia ) , ii ) Age , iii ) Sex , iv ) length time disease , v ) extent disease , vi ) interaction iv v collect . In addition , dysplasia yes/no establish biopsy histology establish modality abnormality observe also record .</detailed_description>
