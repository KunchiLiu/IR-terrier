	<brief_summary>Heart attack lead cause death men woman United States . When person heart attack , blood unable reach certain area heart , blood supply re-established quickly , area heart suffer permanent damage . While recovery heart attack manage medication lifestyle change , treatment reverse original damage heart . Current research focus development cell-based therapy use stem cell repair organ irreversibly damage disease . A specific form stem cell , call adult mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) , show promise heart repair . This study evaluate safety effectiveness inject MSCs heart repair restore heart function people heart attack heart surgery coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Study Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery ( PROMETHEUS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participation study last 18 month . Potential participant undergo initial screen 5 7 week prior CABG surgery . Screening include physical exam , blood draw , pregnancy test , question medical history , current medication , alcohol drug use , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) heart , questionnaire , echocardiogram compute tomography ( CT ) scan . Eligible participant undergo two baseline visit within 6 week schedule surgery . Baseline Visit 1 consist vital sign measurement , bone marrow aspiration obtain MSCs blood draw biomarker test . Baseline Visit 2 include treadmill test , 6-minute walk test , pulmonary function ( FEV1 ) study 48 Hour Ambulatory ECG . After second baseline visit , participant assign randomly receive either MSCs placebo surgery . On day surgery , bypass graft place , high low dose MSCs placebo inject damaged area heart receive bypass graft . After receive injection , participant remain hospital 7 day . During stay , participant undergo daily blood draw , urine test , ECG , ambulatory ECG monitoring first 96 hour surgery . Upon discharge , participant return monthly visit 6 month follow-up visit 12 18 month surgery . These visit repeat initial screen baseline test . There one additional visit 14 day surgery , include question side effect , physical exam , 48-hour ambulatory ECG .</detailed_description>
