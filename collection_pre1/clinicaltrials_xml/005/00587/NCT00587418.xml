	<brief_title>L-arginine Prevention Kidney Damage Liver Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although liver transplantation ( LTx ) well-established mean restore health patient liver failure , remain opportunity optimize outcome . One major source mortality morbidity LTx recipients renal insufficiency associate nephrotoxicity immunosuppressant agent , particularly calcineurin inhibitor ( i.e. , cyclosporine tacrolimus ) . These agent also associate hypertension diabetes among LTx recipient , contribute reduction renal function . In report base nationwide data , 18 % LTx recipient develop renal failure within 5 year . Most decline renal function LTx occur first month . This part patient expose high level calcineurin inhibitor early post-LTx period , risk acute cellular rejection great . Calcineurin inhibitor produce intense renal vasoconstriction , may reversible early . Over time , however , irreversible change , vascular angiopathy , tubular atrophy eventually interstitial fibrosis , contribute permanent reduction renal perfusion glomerular filtration . Thus , intervention preserve renal function LTx would effective early post-LTx period , reduction renal function occur renal vascular change potentially reversible . Existing evidence preliminary data indicate impairment vasodilatory response mediate nitric oxide ( NO ) play important role pathogenesis calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity . Our overall hypothesis L-arginine supplement provide protection calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity . L-arginine , naturally occur amino acid , main substrate NO synthase enzyme exogenous supplementation L-arginine may improve renal perfusion induce renal vasodilation via increase NO production . Although L-arginine show prevent renal damage calcineurin inhibitor experimental animal , efficacy preserve renal function study human LTx recipient . In application , propose conduct pilot , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial explore use prophylactic L-arginine supplement preserve renal function LTx recipient . Twenty-four ( 24 ) LTx recipient recover uneventfully procedure recruit study . Subjects randomize 1:1 receive 9g per day L-arginine placebo give orally 7 day 14 21 day LTx , follow open-label maintenance L-arginine . The aim study follow : AIM 1 . To determine effect oral L-arginine supplement glomerular filtration rate LTx recipient . We compare change GFR , estimate eGFRcys equation , 7-day trial L-arginine versus placebo . The eGFRcys equation recently show accurate GFR estimator incorporate serum cystatin-C creatinine concentration , age , gender race . AIM 2 . To determine effect L-arginine supplement secondary efficacy endpoint . We compare plasma L-arginine concentration urinary cyclic-GMP , latter key metabolite renal NO , L-arginine placebo group . AIM 3 . To evaluate safety oral L-arginine supplement liver transplant recipient . We compare frequency severity adverse event L-arginine placebo group . AIM 4 . To determine effect maintenance open label L-arginine GFR . After 7-day trial , participant offer open label L-arginine 13 additional week . We compare GFR determine iothalamate clearance maintenance use L-arginine supplement . Our hypothesis L-arginine promote release NO renal vascular bed , increase renal blood flow glomerular filtration rate ( AIM 1 ) . We believe critical test patient early LTx irreversible vascular glomerular damage establish . Once proof concept attain , would like link observation plasma L-arginine concentration urinary c-GMP excretion ( AIM 2 ) . Based extensive experience Mayo Clinic use oral L-arginine , expect demonstrate clinically significant adverse event L-arginine ( AIM 3 ) . The data open label maintenance phase ( AIM 4 ) help gauge whether short term benefit show AIM 1 sustainable long time frame . The significance study base several factor : ( 1 ) Calcineurin inhibitor-induced renal insufficiency major source morbidity mortality among LTx recipient ; ( 2 ) Once establish , effective treatment calcineurin inhibitor-induced renal insufficiency ; ( 3 ) If result study support hypothesis , able embark upon full scale , randomize trial long-term oral L-arginine supplement use GFR end point . Such study able answer whether simple amino acid supplement may prevent calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity , make fundamental difference morbidity , mortality quality life patient , undergone life-changing procedure , namely liver transplantation .</detailed_description>
