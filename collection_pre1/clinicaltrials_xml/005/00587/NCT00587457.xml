	<criteria>Confirmed diagnosis BCell Leukemia ( CLL , PLL , SLL ) Measurable Disease Disease characteristic : Patients chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) Small Lymphocytic Leukemia ( SLL ) eligible fail 2 prior course standard chemo and/or biologic therapy ( e.g . Rituxan ) _ prolymphocytic leukemia ( PLL ) eligible fail least one prior standard chemotherapeutic regimen . Medical indication treatment include progressive diseaserelated symptom , progressive cytopenia due marrow involvement , progressive painful splenomegaly adenopathy , rapidly increase lymphocytosis , autoimmune hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia increase frequency infection . ECOG performance status 02 Patients cancer meet eligibility criterion le 5 yr . diseasefree survival consider casebycase basis Life expectancy great 6 mos. , assess principal investigator Must able understand sign inform consent Must least 18 year old Female Male patient agree use approve method contraception study History allogeneic bone marrow transplant . Documented ongoing central nervous system involvement malignant disease ( history CNS involvement exclusion criterion . ) Pregnant breastfeeding female Patients plasma contain either significant level antibody CAT8015 measure ELISA , antibody neutralizes bind CAT8015 CD22 measure competition ELISA . HIV positive serology ( due increase risk severe infection unknown interaction CAT8015 antiretroviral drug ) Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Uncontrolled , symptomatic , intercurrent illness include limited : infection require systemic antibiotic , congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness , social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Hepatic function : Serum transaminase ( either ALT AST ) direct bilirubin great equal Grade 2 , unless bilirubin due Gilbert 's disease Renal function : Serum creatinine clearance less equal 60 mL/min estimate CockcroftGault formula Hematologic function : The ANC le 1000/cmm , platelet count less 50,000/cmm , cytopenia judge investigator due underlying disease ( i.e. , potentially reversible antineoplastic therapy ) . A patient exclude pancytopenia great equal Grade 3 , erythropoietin dependence , due disease , base result bone marrow study . Baseline coagulopathy great equal grade 3 unless due anticoagulant therapy Pulmonary function : Patients le 50 % predict forced expiratory volume ( FEV1 ) less 50 % predict diffusing capacity carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) correct hemoglobin concentration alveolar volume . Note : Patients prior history pulmonary illness require PFTs . FEV1 assess bronchodilator therapy . Recent prior therapy : Cytotoxic chemotherapy , corticosteroid ( except stable dos prednisone ) , whole body electron beam radiation therapy , hormonal , biologic standard investigational therapy malignancy 3 three wks . prior entry trial . Less equal 1 mo . prior monoclonal antibody therapy ( i.e . rituximab ) Patients receive receive radiation therapy le 3 week prior study entry exclude providing volume bone marrow treat less 10 % also patient measureable disease outside radiation port .
