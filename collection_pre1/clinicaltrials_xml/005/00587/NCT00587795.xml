	<brief_summary>Objectives : - To obtain clinical evidence safety efficacy use StabilAir Wrist Fracture Brace follow case : 1 . Acute ( emergency department ) treatment non-displaced , stable extra- articular distal radius fracture ; 2 . To obtain comparative data traditional therapy ( sugar tong , plaster backslab , long arm short arm cast ) use StabilAir brace patient qualify specific criterion . This provide complete cost-of-care analysis one modality . Hypothesis : 1 ) For stable , non-displaced fracture , StabilAir Brace effective sugar tong splint acute setting . 2 ) In case full forearm immobilization initially prefer , StabilAir effective follow-up sugar tong split need full immobilization pass . The benefit utilizing product type acute follow-up set adjustable fit , `` off-the-shelf '' device , quickly comfortably apply patient . It transition effectively product choice remainder treatment rehabilitation since protect , stabilize , support injury adapt change patient condition need . Because removable ( late early fracture core period ) potential benefit comfort hygiene . Therefore , total cost care reduce use one product progress injury fracture reduction recovery ( rather variety product require investment material , time , personnel cast change potential fracture re-reduction . In initial treatment period , StabilAir Brace firmly hold place peripheral `` guard wrap '' remove supervision treat surgeon . Only clear evidence fracture heal present would patient allow physically remove brace .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Orthopedic Study Aircast StabilAir Wrist Fracture Brace</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data Collection Study Design : This single center , prospective , randomize control trial . We collect data 80 patient undisplaced distal radius fracture . Half treat plastic back slab sugar tong splint ( ulnar styloid fracture ) half treat StabilAir splint . The initial treatment , occur upon patient 's arrival emergency room prior study randomization , require full forearm wrist immobilization acute phase treat sugar tong splint . At patient 's follow-up visit , happen ≤10 day post injury initial evaluation , determine full forearm immobilization longer necessary , patient inform study , consent , randomize ( flip coin ) one two study group use computerized randomization process control study coordinator . One study group consist patient treat either sugar tong splint plaster cast study group consist patient treat StabilAir brace . Throughout entire study , sugar tong splint/casting patient control group . Patients ask return follow visit randomize : - 10-14 day post randomization - 35 42 day ( 5 6 week ) post randomization - 77 84 day ( 11 12 week ) post randomization ; - And 12 24 month At visit x-rays wrist exam physician . In addition , ask complete DASH PRWE questionnaires regard general health , daily activity pain . The decision treatment make use LaFontaine criterion . If combination 3 less LaFontaine criterion ( displacement , comminution , distal radio-ulnar joint injury , age &gt; 60 year ) , intra-articular involvement , patient fit criterion inclusion . Exclusion criterion include intra-articular fracture , excessive comminution , open fracture , fail closed reduction fracture require open reduction . Patients loss reduction require secondary treatment exclude . Assessment Results : The result treatment assessed clinical , radiographic patient assessment criterion . Clinical objective assessment perform Gartland-Werley score Mayo Wrist Score . Radiographic assessment make Stewart Score measure dorsal angulation , radial shortening , radio-ulnar test . Functional score include DASH ( disability arm , shoulder , hand ) PRWE ( patient relate wrist evaluation ) . Acute Care ( ED ) Nondisplaced and/or No Forearm Immobilization Required Outcome Measurements : - Initial displacement v position distal fragment 8 week ( Bunger et al . method ) - End fragment position StabilAir brace patient vs traditionally treat patient - Statistical comparison pair T-test . We compare radiographic parameter ( intrarticular displace , Dorsal angulation , Shortening , radial inclination ) , outcome score DASH PRWE identify significant difference base upon n = 40 . We predict assume two-sample t-test use compare two arm , 80 % power detect effect size 0.90 ( almost 1 SD ) . Materials : - StabilAir Wrist fracture orthoses - Stockinets ( extra supply subsequent application patient ) - Hand-bulb pressure gauge - Patient data collection form - initial follow-up - Cast sugar tong material - Patient survey Patient Inclusion Criteria : - Males Females Age ≥ 18 yr - Undisplaced distal radial fracture ( with/without ulnar styloid fracture ) Patient Exclusion Criteria : - Age &lt; 18 yrs - Intra-articular fracture - displaced - Loss reduction cast brace treatment - Excessive comminution ( &gt; 50 % metophysis ) - Failed closed reduction ( Unacceptable alignment s/p CR : Short &gt; 2mm ; Dorsal angulation &gt; 0° ( neutral ) , Radial inclination &lt; 15° ) - Ipsilateral ulna fracture ( styloid ) - Open fracture - Senile dementia lack understand treatment - Previous fracture distal radius - Patients displaced fracture require pin fixation , external fixation , plate fixation qualify `` crystalline injection fracture heal protocol '' exclude study Results Tabular format show : 1 . Anatomical score ( radiographic score - Stewart ) 2 . Functional score ( DASH , PRWE ) 3 . Objective motion grip strength 4 . Wrist score ( Mayo Krimmer wrist score ) 5 . Summarize statistical trend . Discussion : Do result agree support hypothesis ? Is clear difference treatment type ? Is potential loss reduction quote use aircast brace ? Is great number patient converted standard cast sugar tong splint treatment ORIF v external fixation ( assume similar fracture stability criterion ) compression Aircast Stabilair Brace ? Positive feedback indicate benefit patient 's clinical outcome level comfort hand functional use compare cast treatment v bracing .</detailed_description>
