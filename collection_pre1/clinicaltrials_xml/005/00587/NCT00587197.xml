	<brief_summary>Patients cirrhosis require endoscopic screen large esophageal varix . The aim study determine cost -effectiveness patient preference strategy employ abdominal computerize tomography ( CT ) initial screen test identify large esophageal varix . In prospective evaluation,102 patient underwent CT endoscopic screen gastroesophageal varix . Two radiologist read CT independently ; standard upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reference standard . Agreement radiologist , endoscopists regard size varix determine use kappa statistic . Cost-effectiveness analysis perform determine optimal screen strategy varix . Patient preference assess questionnaire . CT find approximately 90 % sensitivity identification esophageal varix determine large endoscopy , 50 % specificity . The sensitivity CT detect gastric varix 87 % . In addition , significant additional number gastric varix , peri-esophageal varix , extraluminal pathology identify CT identify endoscopy . Patients overwhelmingly preferred CT endoscopy . Agreement radiologist good regard size varix ( Kappa = 0.56 ) , exceed agreement endoscopists ( Kappa = 0.36 ) . Use CT initial screen modality detection varix significantly cost-effective compare endoscopy irrespective prevalence large varix . In conclusion , abdominal CT initial screen test varix could cost-effective . CT also permit evaluation extra-luminal pathology impact management .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Evaluation Computerized Tomographic ( CT ) Scanning Screening Modality Esophageal Varices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Group -We screen population 581 consecutive patient cirrhosis schedule undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy . Exclusion criterion include inability provide consent , patient previously undergone liver transplantation , previous portosystemic shunt procedure , recent history ( &lt; 7 day ) upper gastrointestinal bleeding . In addition , patient renal insufficiency define serum creatinine &gt; 1.7 mg/dL non-diabetics &gt; 1.5 mg/dL diabetic exclude give concern regard requirement intravenous contrast CT . Approximately 300 patient meet inclusion criterion screen esophageal varix . Patients endoscopic variceal therapy ( n=19 ) also screen 10 patient include study determine role CT image determine presence varix group patient . The last endoscopic therapy session group great four week prior CT scan order eliminate potential radiological artifact endoscopic treatment . Patients meet inclusion criterion ( n=300 ) decline entry study cite either schedule conflict ( n=142 ) , fear radiation ( n=24 ) . The diagnosis cirrhosis 134 patient consent study base histology ( N = 76 ) ; presence ascites , thrombocytopenia splenomegaly combine low serum albumin ( &lt; 3.4 g/dL ) prolongation prothrombin time ( INR &gt; 1.3 ) compatible abdominal imaging ( N = 58 ) . No endoscopy perform purely research purpose . Written inform consent obtain patient enrol study . Of 134 patient consent , 102 complete endoscopic CT examination . To reflect practice real world , endoscopic procedure deliberately choose carry regularly schedule endoscopists rather small select group experience endoscopists . Varices regard present absent , size record either large ( â‰¥5 mm diameter ) small ( &lt; 5 mm diameter ) base subjective assessment diameter.. Titrated sedation undertaken patient midazolam fentanyl.. The size esophageal varix measure distal 5 cm esophagus withdrawal instrument . Two gastrointestinal radiologist ( R1 R2 ) , 10 year experience blind 's evaluation , well result endoscopy , read CT study . Axial image evaluate determine presence size esophageal gastric varix . Multidetector CT scan ( four detector higher ) perform use 0.5 second rotation time , scanner setting 250 mAs 120 kVp , slice thickness 3 mm , 3 mm reconstruction interval . Intravenous low osmolar iodinate contrast ( Omnipaque 300 ; GE Healthcare ) administrate rate 4ml/second , late arterial phase scan initiate 35 second contrast injection , carry liver dome liver pancreas . Portal phase image initiate 70 second contrast injection , carry diaphragm iliac crest . Partial phase image also reconstruct nominal slice thickness 0.75-1.5 mm 20cm field view maximize spatial resolution.. The total effective radiation dose protocol 15mSv . There possible clinical indication perform CT abdomen 44 patient ; CT perform solely research purpose 58 patient . Large esophageal varix CT scan define measure great equal 5 mm diameter , small varix measure less 5 mm diameter . To determine degree interobserver variability regard characterization variceal size endoscopists , photographs esophageal varix take endoscopy randomly select image circulate among 5 endoscopists , 2 &lt; 5 year ' experience practice 3 &gt; 15 year ' experience . The endoscopists blind result 's interpretation ask characterize endoscopic image either small , large , absent varix . Patient satisfaction endoscopy CT determine administer questionnaire patient complete 24 hour procedure . The questionnaire determine patient 's opinion regard element comfort convenience test . In addition , patient preference either study reason preference elicit . Statistical Analysis - Sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value CT determine characteristic varix determine radiologist endoscopy regard reference standard . The sensitivity CT detect large varix determine identify patient large varix endoscopy identify CT esophageal varix . The specificity CT identify esophageal varix define correctly identify absence varix patient varix find endoscopically . Dilated tortuous vein protrude lumen stomach CT term gastric varix . Variceal channel course along adventitia esophagus , protrude esophageal lumen term peri-esophageal varix . Kappa statistic use determine agreement observer grade size varix , endoscopy CT. We assume 40 % prevalence rate esophageal varix , 20 % rate large varix ( 2,8 ) . To detect 15 % difference detection rate esophageal varix CT endoscopy , 95 patient would require studied alpha 0.05 ( one tail test ) , alpha 0.10 ( two tail test ) , beta 0.20 . Decision Model We compare cost-effectiveness three strategy detection large varix patient cirrhosis use decision tree approach . The comparison strategies 1 ) Endoscopy , 2 ) CT 3 ) CT + Endoscopy patient small varix CT . The model contructed use Treeage Pro Suite 2007 ( Treeage Software , Williamstown , MA ) . Patients consider analysis assume compensated cirrhosis presence absence esophageal varix know . The decision tree assume two year time horizon . The efficacy cost three approach compare use incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICERs ) . The decision tree present Appendix ( Figure 1 ) We make number assumption analysis . The full set assumption present appendix ( Table 1 ) . We assume sensitivity test strategy subsequent complication bleed rate various source . The sensitivity detection large varix CT derive result presented paper . The analysis conduct perspective third party payer , consider direct health care cost . Costs discount due relatively short time horizon analysis ( two year ) . The main outcome analysis cost per variceal bleed prevent . The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) calculate compare `` Do Nothing '' strategy . The study protocol approve Institutional Review Board .</detailed_description>
