	<brief_title>Peptide Profiles Women Undergoing Breast Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite currently available screen technique , 63 % breast cancer case diagnose localized stage , 5-year survival rate exceed 95 % ( 1 ) . Advances breast image occur , effort detect breast cancer early stage would beneficial . Recently , new technology use mass spectrometric analysis characterize overall pattern peptide expression serum plasma develop . Preliminary study suggest peptide profile use differentiate cancer patient without cancer variety malignancy include breast cancer . If mass spectrometric analysis able detect difference peptide profile early stage breast cancer normal control , technique could develop screen modality . The objective present study entitle `` Peptide Profiles Women Undergoing Breast Biopsy '' determine whether diagnosis malignancy breast biopsy associate specific serum plasma peptide profile distinguish peptide profile associate benign diagnosis breast biopsy . To accomplish , blood sample collect 500 woman undergo breast biopsy 100 woman metastatic disease . Samples obtain prior biopsy analyze mass spectrometry . Residual material share investigator National Cancer Institute Clinical Proteomics Technology Assessment Consortium .</detailed_description>
