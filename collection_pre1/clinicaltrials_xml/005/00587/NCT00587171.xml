	<brief_summary>This study compare effectiveness patching combine active vision therapy plus near activity versus patch combine control vision therapy plus near activity moderate amblyopia ( 20/40-20/100 ) 7 &lt; 13 year old . The primary outcome measure proportion patient visual acuity 20/25 good amblyopic eye 17-week masked exam . These patient consider treatment responder . The primary analysis consist comparison 2 treatment group proportion treatment responder adjustment baseline visual acuity . Secondary outcome stereoacuity 17-week mask exam , mean improvement visual acuity 17-week masked exam , rate improvement visual acuity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Patching With Active Vision Therapy Patching With Control Vision Therapy Treatment Amblyopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patching atropine traditionally use improvement visual acuity child amblyopia . Previous study show method treatment effective young child functional amblyopia . More recently ATS3 , randomize clinical trial 507 child age 7- &lt; 18 , find part-time patching combine atropine near activity improve visual acuity two line 53 % 7 12 year old compare 25 % optical correction alone . For 13 17 year old , part-time patching near activity improve visual acuity 2 line 25 % , compare 23 % optical correction alone . While appear patch and/or atropine , combine near activity , improve visual acuity patient age 7- &lt; 18 , patient study leave residual visual acuity deficit . To improve visual acuity binocularity child amblyopia eye care provider augment traditional therapy vision therapy . Vision therapy prescribe initially moderate amblyopia stereopsis . Vision therapy add treatment regimen patient reach moderate level vision loss stereopsis patient still respond current treatment still moderate amblyopia . It think best candidate type therapy child minimum level stereopsis ( least 800 '' ) without constant strabismus . Those child stereopsis would able perform activity later stage therapy utilize binocular vision . Vision therapy sequence prescribe activity typically perform daily basis home weekly in-office , direct toward individual patient 's deficient skill . Visual skill practice condition provide patient feedback . The feedback , along gradual increase demand activity improvement occur , enable patient improve visual function visual acuity , fixation , accommodation , vergence skill . There case report small sample study show vision therapy combination spectacle occlusion effective improve visual acuity patient amblyopia . Wick et al look nineteen patient diagnose anisometropic amblyopia age 6 49 . Seventeen patient moderate amblyopia two severe amblyopia , base definition amblyopia use Amblyopia Treatment Studies . The patient treat sequence include spectacle correction , occlusion therapy monocular binocular vision therapy . Thirteen seventeen patient moderate amblyopia final visual acuity 20/25 good patient moderate amblyopia 20/30 well final visual acuity . More recent report `` perceptual learning , '' active form therapy amblyopic subject practice position-discrimination task , show mean acuity improvement approximately 30 % ( two line ) amblyopic child adult complete occlusion therapy . These study provide support notion practice particular visual skill condition provide patient feedback ( e.g. , vision therapy ) may beneficial improve visual performance amblyopic eye . The second reason prescribe active therapy enhance facilitate effect occlusion directly treat aforementioned deficit find associate amblyopia . Most therapy procedure design remediate specific deficiency four main area : fixation , spatial perception , accommodative efficiency , binocular function oculomotor control . Lastly , investigator suggest use vision therapy may reduce likelihood recurrence amblyopia . This may particularly true anisometropic amblyopia vision therapy use improve binocular function .</detailed_description>
