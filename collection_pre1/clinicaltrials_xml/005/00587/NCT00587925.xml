	<brief_summary>Bone Mineral Density ( BMD ) measure X-ray show amount calcium bone . Low BMD may reflect osteoporosis , condition increase risk fracture . Women go menopause high risk get osteoporosis lose calcium bone much faster young woman . Women breast cancer may additional risk get osteoporosis effect treatment chemotherapy . The purpose study see level BMD post-menopausal woman breast cancer , see level BMD change woman 's treatment surgery . This trial study change BMD marker bone activity woman receive treatment early stage breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Bone Mineral Density Postmenopausal Women After Treatment Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer patient may increase risk osteoporosis secondary cancer treatment . The hypothesis study adjuvant chemotherapy increase risk osteoporosis postmenopausal woman . The objective pilot study describe effect chemotherapy bone mineral density serum marker bone metabolism . There limited data change bone mineral density due chemotherapy postmenopausal woman . This prospective study gather data effect systemic breast cancer therapy bone mineral density postmenopausal woman receive adjuvant care early stage ( 0 , I , II III ) breast cancer . Postmenopausal woman focus study : ( 1 ) large subgroup woman breast cancer ( 2 ) expect rate BMD loss unless disturbed disease medication , unlike pre perimenopausal woman whose BMD dramatically affect change hormonal status ( 3 ) group patient great risk acute osteoporotic fracture .</detailed_description>

DCIS allow , LCIS ( ) . Adjuvant care administer clinically indicate . Adjuvant treatment decision stipulate trial . Postmenopausal define last menstrual cycle occur 5 year previously . Women hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy consider postmenopausal great 55 year age . Women bilateral oophorectomy 5 year previously consider postmenopausal . Chemotherapy Arm : Patients begin adjuvant , neoadjuvant , treatment Doxorubicin ( 60mg/m2 ) , Cyclophosphamide ( 600mg/m2 ) follow Paclitaxel ( 175mg/m2 ) ( ACT ) Doxorubicin ( 60mg/m2 ) 4 cycle follow Paclitaxel ( 175mg/m2 ) 4 cycle follow Cyclophosphamide ( 600mg/m2 ) 4 cycle ( ATC ) administer dose dense regimen every 2 week growth factor support . The patient may enter trial within 3 month initiate adjuvant chemotherapy . Observation Arm : Patients begin adjuvant follow expectant monitoring ( systemic therapy ) . The patient may enter trial within 2 month initiate adjuvant care . Signed informed consent Assessment complete blood count complete biochemical profile must indicate absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000/ul , hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dl platelet &gt; 100,000/ul bilirubin , liver transaminase ( AST/ALT ) serum creatinine must within 2.5 time institutional upper level normal time enrollment study . Any metabolic bone disease ( include Paget 's disease bone ) postmenopausal osteoporosis osteopenia . Use systemic gonadal hormonal medication supplement within past 24 month . Topical vaginal estrogen `` Estring '' vaginal estrogenic compound associate systemic absorption allow . Prior use tamoxifen raloxifene permit medication discontinue 24 month prior diagnosis breast cancer . No adjuvant antiestrogen , antineoplastic , therapy permit study . Chronic use systemic steroid ( equivalent prednisone 5mg daily 3 month ) disease process breast cancer chemotherapy premedications antiemetic . Inhaled steroid allow , occasional use low moderate dose short pulse steroid . History rheumatoid arthritis , ankylose spondylitis , hyperparathyroidism , renal osteodystrophy , moderate severe inflammatory autoimmune diseases newly diagnose thyroid condition require titration medication ( stable dose minor dose modification thyroid medication acceptable ) . Other exclusionary comorbid condition include thalassemia , moderate severe malabsorptive syndrome HIV . Patients diagnose condition similar comorbid and/or inflammatory disease associate change BMD either disease process therapy condition ( ) course study remove study point diagnosis . Lobular carcinoma situ ( LCIS ) Stage IV breast cancer patient concurrently active second malignancy adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer situ cervical cancer . Patients nonmammary malignancy , prior breast cancer , must disease free least 5 year . Participation clinical trial measure BMD study parameter Patients condition expect distort BMD read make DEXA result unreliable bilateral prosthetic hip , extensive degenerative joint disease , severe calcification aorta . Patients concurrent medical psychiatric condition , judgment consent investigator , would prevent understand comply clinical trial .</criteria>
