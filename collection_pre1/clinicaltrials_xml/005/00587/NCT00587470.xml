	<brief_summary>Mitral regurgitation ( MR ) common elderly prevalence increase age population . Organic MR , due primary valvular lesion , initiate cascade complication determine degree . MR severe degree associate excess mortality high cardiac morbidity ( heart failure , atrial fibrillation ) . It also cause leave ventricular remodel induces leave ventricular dysfunction , turn lead poor clinical outcome . Surgery eliminate MR , carry immediate long-term risk , especially elderly . Therefore , chronically decrease degree MR major goal medical therapy effect yet unproved conflict result small mostly non-randomized series . Our recent preliminary study suggest sustain decrease degree MR improvement leave ventricular remodel achieve powerful reduction afterload , obtain particular angiotensin-II receptor blockade . Therefore , present proposal seek address gap knowledge regard vasoactive treatment MR verification follow hypothesis : Hypothesis : Vasoactive therapy use angiotensin-II receptor blocker ( Candesartan Cilexetil ) weigh placebo produce sustain reduction consequence organic MR . The specific aim treatment ) decrease degree MR ( decrease regurgitant volume , primary end-point ) b ) improve left ventricular remodeling ( decrease end-diastolic volume index , secondary end-point ) , compare placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients MR organic ( intrinsic valve disease ) , isolate ( valve disease ) , moderate severe ( regurgitant volume *30 mL/beat ) . A Clinical trial , randomize , placebo control , double-blind , without cross-over , 1 year oral treatment potent angiotensin-II receptor blockade use 32 mg Candesartan daily . The trial precede patient acute open-label study determine tolerance immediate response . The method use measure end-points : ) Doppler-Echocardiography quantitation degree MR ( measurement regurgitant volume ) use combination three simultaneous method ( quantitative Doppler , quantitative two-dimensional echocardiography , proximal flow convergence ) b ) leave ventricular remodeling ( end-diastolic volume index measure echocardiography electron beam compute tomography ) . This single center study seek enroll total 90 patient . The analysis base intention treat compare regurgitant volume leave ventricular end-diastolic volume index measure one year treatment active drug placebo . The result trial provide strong evidence regard medical treatment patient organic MR .</detailed_description>
