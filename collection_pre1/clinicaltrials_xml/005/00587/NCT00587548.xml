	<brief_summary>This study do find different way identify ureter abdominal operation . During operation , operate physician must identify ureter prevent injury . Typically , surgeon call urologist thread small scope camera urethra ( urine come ) place wire two ureter locate . Instead procedure , inject small amount radioactive chemical dye ( TC99-DTPA ) vein arm . The ureter detect hand hold probe call 'gamma probe . ' The TC99-DTPA dye pass body excreted urine . The goal study probe alert physician place directly ureter since TC99-DTPA dye highlight ureter flow urine go .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient population include undergoing elective , open , abdominal surgery . The patient receive , average , 4.5mCi Technetium label diethylene-triamine-penta acetate ( DTPA ) prior time ureteral localization . The Neoprobe 2000 gamma probe place field sterile fashion manner similar perform minimally invasive parathyroidectomy sentinel lymph node biopsy . The surgery continue surgical team feel time appropriate ureter identify . At point , surgical team use gamma probe localize ureter attend physician note either , `` yes '' , `` '' feel correctly identify identify ureter . The surgical team know ureter correctly identify gentle manipulation tissue forceps produce `` vermicular contraction '' tubular structure suspect ureter . No tissue and/or structure produce classic type contraction . Background gamma count , gamma count ureter , time Tc-DTPA injection ureteral localization record ureter sought . If ureter localize technique , surgical team feel imperative ureter identify , attend surgeon may request urologist place stent standard , usual fashion .</detailed_description>
