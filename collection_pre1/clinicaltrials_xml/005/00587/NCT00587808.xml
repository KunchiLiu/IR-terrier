	<brief_title>Mechanisms Heart Failure With Normal EF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nearly half patient heart failure preserve ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) 1-3 . This group increase prevalence , similar morbidity mortality systolic HF , , despite increase awareness healthcare burden , without proven treatments1 . This related largely limited understand basic mechanism cause disease3 . Recent study add contemporary understanding , pathophysiology remain controversial incompletely understood4-8 . A limitation prior study noninvasive measurement employ merely surrogates gold standard , invasive hemodynamic assessment9 . There general consensus HFpEF patient increase left ventricular filling pressure ( LVDP ) relatively normal systolic function rest5,8,10 , two critical question remain : cause increase LVDP , , important deficit cardiovascular response exercise stress HFpEF patients3,4 ? The current study resolve question perform comprehensive hemodynamic analysis HFpEF patient refer cardiac cath lab , compare age gender match control without HF . LV systolic , diastolic , vascular function examine rest grade supine exercise fix varied preload definitively characterize baseline difference discrepancy cardiovascular reserve function become apparent stress , HFpEF patient typically become symptomatic11 . This study yield valuable information describe role systolic , diastolic pericardial abnormality pathogenesis HFpEF , provide critical preliminary data upon good target therapeutic trial common disorder base .</detailed_description>
