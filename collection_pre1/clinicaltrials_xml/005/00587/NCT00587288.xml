	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Reslizumab Treat Poorly Controlled Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : Primary : To demonstrate ability reslizumab improve asthma control subject active asthma eosinophilic airway inflammation . Secondary : - To study ability reslizumab reduce induce sputum eosinophil ( EOS ) count subject asthma . - To study ability reslizumab reduce number eosinophilic clinical asthma exacerbation ( CAE ) subject asthma . A CAE define ≥ 20 % decrease forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ; absolute value ) baseline value requirement emergency treatment asthma , hospital admission asthma treatment three day oral corticosteroid ( OCS ) asthma worsen . - To assess safety tolerability reslizumab subject asthma .</detailed_description>
