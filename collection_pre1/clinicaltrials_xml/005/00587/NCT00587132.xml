	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer fourth common cause cancer death US . Because patient pancreatic cancer rarely present disease specific symptom late course disease , identify develop surveillance strategy early detection asymptomatic pancreatic cancer critical . EUS fine needle aspirate ( FNA ) currently accurate non-operative method establish presence absence pancreatic cancer . The CT finding pancreatic cancer include attenuation difference pancreatic mass surround pancreatic parenchyma , pancreatic ductal dilation cutoff , disruption normal fatty marble pancreatic parenchyma , round inferior margin posterior head pancreas , atrophy proximal gland , sign locally advance distant disease . In case-controlled retrospective review pancreatic cancer miss CT prior clinical presentation Mayo Clinic , Gangi et al find CT finding definite suspicious pancreatic cancer present 50 % scan obtain 18 month clinical diagnosis pancreatic cancer . Pancreatic duct dilation cutoff early CT finding indicate tumor presence , associate near-perfect substantial interobserver agreement . Consequently , early pancreatic neoplasm likely result least partial occlusion duct , lead subsequent ductal dilation . We hypothesize increased production pancreatic juice distends otherwise small caliber pancreatic duct , accentuate secondary sign pancreatic duct obstruction small pancreatic mass . The investigator able take advantage physiologic effect secretin , obtain multi-planar scan isotropic resolution use 64-channel CT system . Secretin safe agent increase pancreatic exocrine secretion . Intravenously administer secretin increase pancreatic juice secretion , magnetic resonance CT scan obtain secretin show improve visualization pancreatic duct . Day 1 : Patient fast 4 hour prior study . 1 L water give mouth oral contrast material 30 minute prior study . After place angiocath antecubital fossa , patient place supine position CT scanner . Secretin test dose give intravenously ( 0.2mcg ( 0.1ml ) . If reaction note one minute , Secretin give intravenously ( 0.2 mcg/kg IV slowly one minute ) . If allergic reaction note , patient CT scan perform part study protocol , participant ineligible participant study . Secretin bolus terminate Systolic BP &lt; 90mm/Hg correct IV fluid . Pre-contrast scan obtain collimation 0.6 x 64 mm pitch 1.2 abdomen deep inspiration . Images reconstruct 1 mm slice thickness 2 mm increment . Five minute administration intravenous Secretin , iodinate contrast Omnipaque 350 administer 3-5ml/sec . Post-iodine-contrast scanning obtain collimation 0.6 x 64 mm pitch 1.2 abdomen scan delay 40- 70-seconds . Total 150 ml intravenous iodinate contrast administer rate 3 - 5 ml/ sec . For 3 month ( Day 2 ) 18 month ( Day 3 ) follow-up CT imaging : Patient fast four hour scan . 1 liter water give orally 30 minute prior scan . An IV place , participant iodinate contrast ( Omnipaque 350 ) administer 3-5ml/sec . Post iodine scan do collimation 0.6 x64mm pitch 1.2 abdomen scan delay 40 70 second . For optional CT scan initial positive CT : This exam do endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) . Patient fast four hour scan . 1 liter water give orally 30 minute prior scan . An IV place , participant iodinate contrast ( Omnipaque 350 ) administer 3-5ml/sec . Post iodine scan do collimation 0.6 x64mm pitch 1.2 abdomen scan delay 40 70 second . Subjects follow 3-5 year determine develop pancreatic cancer .</detailed_description>
