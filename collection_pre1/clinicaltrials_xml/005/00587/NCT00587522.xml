	<brief_summary>The purpose prospective , multicenter study evaluate safety efficacy endoscopic full-thickness plication treatment symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux . Sixty-four patient enrol underwent endoscopic full-thickness plication . All patient receive single implant/plication . No repeat plication procedure perform . Primary efficacy study measure percent reduction post-procedure GERD symptom evidence analysis GERD-HRQL ( Health Related Quality Life ) questionnaire . Secondary efficacy outcome include post-procedure reduction anti-secretory therapy , improvement quality life questionnaire , reduction distal esophageal acid exposure , improvement esophageal manometry . Patient follow-up assessment complete 1 , 3 , 6 12 month post treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective study measure reduction GERD symptom evidence analysis GERD-HRQL questionnaire 3-months post-procedure objective achieve 50 % great improvement . The trial power detect 50 % reduction mean GERD-HRQL 3-months use one-sided t-test α .05 β level .10 , test versus equality mean . The calculation reference include added assumption standard deviation 20 percent . The null hypothesis state mean percent reduction GERD symptoms less equal 50 percent 3-months versus alternate hypothesis great . The device treatment consider success statistical test reject null hypothesis one-sided p-value 0.05 less . Primary endpoint success thus related statistical conclusion mean percent reduction great 50 % . A one-sided 95 percent confidence interval construct percent reduction GERD symptom . In order ass data `` Intent Treat '' spirit , number patient achieve 50 % reduction analyze fraction total number patient receive treatment . For secondary endpoint measure , statistical test median base Wilcoxon sign rank test percent improvement give study measure . This base paired patient data pre-treatment score versus 6-month score . The issue multiple statistical test hypothesis perform data arise individual patient address follow way . The comparison GERD-HRQL score take main result correction significance level necessary . To recognize multiple test use method Bonferroni , statistical significance claim secondary result , single test , nominal p-value &lt; .01 . Given patient , course clinical study , lose follow-up , outcome examine use method last visit carry forward , provide least one follow-up visit complete . It note use method little impact result ; compare analysis data patient complete follow-up , exclude miss visit lose follow . However , method employ account patient lose follow-up , specific consideration lose follow-up due unsatisfactory treatment effect . Means standard deviation report use mean ( SD ) format , median interquartile range report use median ( IQR ) format .</detailed_description>
