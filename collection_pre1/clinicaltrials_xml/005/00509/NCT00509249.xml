	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well aflibercept work treat patient myelodysplastic syndrome . Aflibercept may able carry cancer-killing substance directly myelodysplastic syndrome cell . It may also stop growth cancer cell block blood flow cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aflibercept Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To determine antitumor activity aflibercept assessed hematological response rate . II . To determine overall progression-free survival patient myelodysplastic syndrome . III . To assess hematologic improvement time leukemic transformation . IV . To assess toxicity profile aflibercept patient population . V. To perform correlative study well understand ability aflibercept reach modulate respective target . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive aflibercept IV 1 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood bone marrow sample obtain periodically pharmacokinetic biomarker correlative study . Pharmacokinetic analysis ELISA ; anti-aflibercept antibody measurement ; analysis VEGF VEGFR expression ; analysis gene expression quantitative PCR conduct . The effect aflibercept apoptosis proliferation CD34+ cell also analyze flow cytometry base assay . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
