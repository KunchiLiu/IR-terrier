	<detailed_description>Vitiligo chronic disease cause loss melanocyte pigment skin . Traditional treatment vitiligo include topical corticosteroid phototherapy lead limited clinical effect . Autologous melanocyte transplantation another way treat vitiligo . However , effect largely affect whether cultivate melanocyte successfully uptaken vitiliginous skin . The aim study survey self-assembly biomaterials functional analysis . In long run , study may provide good way treatment vitiligo .</detailed_description>
