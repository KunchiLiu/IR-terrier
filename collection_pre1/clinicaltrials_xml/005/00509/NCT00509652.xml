	<brief_title>Erythrocyte Apheresis Versus Phlebotomy Hemochromatosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Primary hemochromatosis frequent hereditary condition Scandinavia . The condition may result serious organ damage prevent therapy , patient develop organ damage . Provided lack exact knowledge patient treat , base inclusion criterion guideline publish Norwegian Society Hematology . However , criterion ferritin level set 300 micrograms/L patient homozygous C282Y mutation , also heterozygous individual include ferritin high 500 micrograms/L . Furthermore , optimal treatment method still matter discussion . Prevention organ damage traditionally accomplished whole blood phlebotomy , frequently repeat initial phase continue indefinitely maintenance treatment . The removed amount iron may increase two- threefold procedure use modern equipment selective withdrawal red blood cell ( erythrocyte apheresis ) . Possible drawback technique may higher cost , prolong time therapeutic procedure , certain requirement patient . The possible advantage reduce number therapeutic procedure less strain patient . No large , randomize study publish order determine method prefer . Hypothesis : A rapid decline primary endpoint ( see ) achieve erythrocyte apheresis compare traditional phlebotomy , without significant disadvantage . Design The trial prospective , randomized open . Eligible patient randomize erythrocyte apheresis phlebotomy . Endpoints Primary endpoint Decline ferritin level transferrin saturation . Secondary endpoint variable study Decline hemoglobin level . Discomfort therapeutic procedure . Any change EVF , blood cell count albumin CRP level . Certain well-defined financial cost : consume material , technician working time . Inclusion criteria 1 . Diagnosis 1 . Individuals art homozygous C282Y H63D `` compound heterozygous '' tow variant ferritin level higher 300 micrograms/L transferrin saturation high 50 % . 2 . Individuals heterozygous C282Y H63D ferritin level higher 500 micrograms/L transferrin saturation high 50 % . 2 . Requirements patient Body weight high 65 kg initial hemoglobin level high 12 g/dL . Treatment schedule Following randomization either apheresis phlebotomy , patient treat ferritin level decline 50 micrograms/L follow one year . Patients randomized apheresis treat every second week , whereas patient phlebotomy group treat weekly . Prolongation interval permit group case well-defined clinical indication . Any prolongation record along clinical indication . Follow-up Clinical symptom , body weight , laboratory finding ( Hemoglobin level ; blood cell count ; level iron , transferrin , ferritin , albumin IgG ; serologic assessment hepatitis virus , CMV HIV ) , discomfort therapeutic procedure , duration procedure , cost consume material , working time technician procedure .</detailed_description>
