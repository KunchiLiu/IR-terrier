	<detailed_description>Irinotecan chemotherapy drug fight cancer interfere cancer cell ' ability divide grow . Before treatment start , ask question health complete physical exam . You electrocardiogram ( ECG - test measure electrical activity heart ) . You compute tomography ( CT ) scan x-rays check status disease . If doctor feel necessary , may also magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Women able child must negative blood urine pregnancy test . During treatment , receive irinotecan vein one hour , day 5 day row . This follow 2 day study drug treatment , 5 day treatment irinotecan . This 12-day period follow 9 day rest ( study drug ) . This 21-day period call cycle therapy . You continue receive treatment ( cycle repeat ) long disease get bad maximal shrinkage cancer . Treatment may take outpatient basis . During treatment , blood collect ( 1-2 teaspoon ) week routine test . At least every cycle treatment ( 3 week ) physical exam ask question health . After first 2 cycle , disease re-evaluated .
