	<brief_title>Pazopanib Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine antitumor activity pazopanib , term objective response rate ( partial complete response ) , patient recurrent metastatic invasive breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration objective response , rate duration stable disease . II . To determine 6-month progression-free median overall survival rate patient treated drug . III . To document safety tolerability drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open label study . Patients receive oral pazopanib daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline 1 , 4 , 8 week correlative laboratory study . Blood sample evaluate follow tumor marker ELISA : VEGF , bFGF , sFLT-1 , sTIE-2 , sE-Selectin , VCAM-1 , PDGF-AA , PDGF-AB PDGF-BB . TSP-1 plasma measure Accucyte™ competitive immunoassay . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
