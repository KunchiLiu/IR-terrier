	<brief_title>Iressa Study Patients With Salivary Gland Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) may involve certain type cancer , include squamous cell carcinoma skin . When EGFR stimulate , series chemical reaction start result tumor `` tell '' grow . ZD1839 ( Iressa® Gefitinib ) try stop reaction block EGFR . This may stop tumor grow . If eligible take part study , take gefitinib treatment mouth day , every day , time morning . It take without food . If forget take dose , last miss dose take soon remember , long least 12 hour next dose due take . Every four week treatment , physical exam blood ( around 3-4 teaspoon ) collect routine test . If skin lesion , lesion measure photographed research purpose . You identified picture . You also ask side effect may experience . If doctor feel necessary , may frequent check-ups . Every eight week treatment , image test . The imaging test include , chest x-ray CT scan MRI head neck area . You may also CT scan area body . These test do check status disease . You continue take gefitinib long disease respond treatment . If time study disease become bad experience intolerable side effect , take study doctor discus treatment option . Sometimes , new information become available may influence decision continue study . The following new information available : Results two large study show benefit add gefitinib chemotherapy platinum one chemotherapy drug give first treatment non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Therefore , gefitinib approve use combination chemotherapy treatment NSCLC . This investigational study . The FDA authorize gefitinib use cancer research . Up 80 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
