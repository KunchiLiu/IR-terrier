	<brief_summary>The efficacy inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) asthmatic subject show sputum eosinophils controversial . The broad aim study ass whether ICS alone combination long-acting beta-2 agonist effective treatment non-eosinophilic asthmatic subject . Methods : The investigator perform randomize double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study compare efficacy ICS placebo 4 week follow 4-week open treatment period ICS/salmeterol steroid-na√Øve asthmatic subject without sputum eosinophilia . The primary outcome Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ ) score four week treatment ICS placebo . This study determine whether non-eosinophilic asthmatic subject respond ICS benefit addition long-acting beta-2 agonist . This study also determine whether assessment airway inflammation perform every asthmatic patient order give appropriate treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>General objective : To assess whether inhaled corticosteroid alone combination long-acting beta-2 agonist effective treatment non-eosinophilic asthmatic subject . Specific objective 1 . To compare change clinical functional outcome treatment fluticasone placebo non-eosinophilic asthmatic subject . Specific objective 2 . To assess whether combination inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) long-acting beta-2 agonist provide improvement asthma control compare treatment ICS placebo non-eosinophilic asthmatic . Hypothesis : Treatment ICS induce significant clinical physiologic improvement non-eosinophilic asthmatic subject . ICS/Salmeterol also provide clinical physiologic benefit compare placebo . Primary end point : Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ ) score 4 week treatment ICS placebo . The Asthma Control Questionnaire choose primary outcome since relevant clinical measure assess asthma control short period time . In patient whose asthma stable clinic visit , reliability ACQ high ( intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) =0.90 ) . Furthermore , questionnaire also responsive change asthma control ( 7 ) . Therefore , ideal tool ass compare change asthma control short period time . This instrument advantage include asthma symptom well forced expiratory flow one second ( FEV1 ) . A change ACQ 0.5 show clinically significant . Therefore , able ass whether treatment ICS ability significantly improve asthma control non-eosinophilic asthmatic subject . The questionnaire provide appendix III . Other functional clinical outcome quality life , FEV1 , provocative concentration methacholine induce 20 % fall FEV1 ( PC20 ) , number rescue medication number asthma exacerbation also assess secondary outcome . The study two step : The first step randomize double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study compare efficacy ICS placebo 4 week asthmatic subject without sputum eosinophilia follow open ICS/salmeterol 4-week treatment subject . ( See study design appendix III ) . Inclusion criteria One hundred subject enrol .</detailed_description>
