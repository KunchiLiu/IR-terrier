	<brief_title>Physical Activity Usual Care Preventing Weight Gain Women With Stage I Stage II Breast Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine feasibility conduct clinical trial use 6-month physical activity intervention initiate within 45 day surgery early-stage breast cancer prior initiation adjuvant chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , and/or radiotherapy . ( phase I ) - Determine participation 6-month physical activity intervention initiate within 45 day surgery early-stage breast cancer decrease weight gain patient treat adjuvant chemotherapy . ( phase II ) - Determine participation 6-month physical activity intervention initiate within 45 day surgery early-stage breast cancer differentially affect weight change woman premenopausal compare postmenopausal diagnosis . ( phase II ) Secondary - Determine participation 6-month physical activity intervention initiate within 45 day surgery early-stage breast cancer decrease gain adiposity patient treat adjuvant chemotherapy . ( phase II ) - Determine participation 6-month physical activity intervention initiate within 45 day surgery early-stage breast cancer differentially affect change adiposity among woman premenopausal compare postmenopausal diagnosis . ( phase II ) - Determine participation 6-month physical activity intervention initiate within 45 day surgery early-stage breast cancer decrease frequency depressive symptomology improve quality life among patient treat adjuvant chemotherapy . ( phase II ) OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord participate site menopausal status ( premenopausal v postmenopausal ) . Patients randomize 1 2 intervention arm . - Arm I ( exercise usual care ) : Patients receive usual care enrol exercise weight control program Curves® fitness center . The Curves® program , begin third week study , use aerobic activity resistance training reduce weight increase strength fitness . Patients exercise minimum 3 time per week , approximately 30 minute every time , 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients ' physical activity measure baseline 3- 6-month follow-up visit . Patients also undergo behavior modification counsel study nurse help overcome specific barrier adhere recommend exercise routine . Counseling session conduct every 2 3 week chemotherapy least monthly completion chemotherapy 6 month , start within 2 week randomization prior initiation Curves® intervention . - Arm II ( control : usual care alone ) : Patients receive usual care general advice cop breast cancer treatment 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive counseling recommendation concern emotional practical barrier encounter breast cancer treatment . Dietary information obtain patient telephone three 24-hour dietary recall perform within 2 week baseline 3-month 6-month follow-up visit estimate total energy intake throughout study . Patients complete questionnaire baseline periodically study assess demographic characteristic establish breast cancer risk factor , medical history , health change . Weight , adiposity measure waist circumference , quality life , depressive symptomology assess baseline 3- 6-month follow-up visit . After completion study intervention , patient follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
