	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION 1.1 Mass drug administration public health tool In 1950s , WHO include mass drug administration ( MDA ) antimalarial drug tool malaria control 'exceptional condition conventional control strategy fail ' . Subsequently , MDA receive little attention introduction artemisinin base combination therapy ( ACT ) . The principle aim MDA interrupt malaria transmission clear population sexual stage parasite , gametocyte , prior transmission season ( figure 1 ) . Gametocytes essential propagation disease elimination gametocytes result reduction malaria transmission . As consequence , successful MDA reduce burden disease population expect little influence development protective immunity area low transmission intensity . In Africa , one large scale MDA study conduct last 10 year . That study , conduct The Gambia use sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) plus single dose artesunate ( AS ) , fail show significant impact MDA malaria transmission.1 Possible reason failure limited impact drug regimen ( single dose AS ) malaria transmission , incomplete coverage , relatively high transmission intensity area migration individual village . Here , propose conduct MDA study area low malaria transmission intensity Tanzania . 1.2 Drug-combinations MDA Antimalarial drug suitable MDA safe , effective clear asexual parasite profound effect gametocyte . Artemisinin base combination therapy fulfil criterion . The combination sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) three dose regimen artesunate ( AS ) extensively test Tanzania , Uganda Kenya , safe efficacious clear asexual parasite reduces gametocytaemia . In pregnant woman , negative effect AS report . SP + AS , however , capable clearing gametocyte therefore unable fully prevent malaria transmission . Primaquine ( PQ ) drug show actively clear gametocyte . PQ previously use treat symptomatic patient low Moshi area , area current study carry . The rationale reduce post-treatment malaria transmission . The strategy abandon follow national guideline side effect report . In addition , PQ recently use combination SP AS find safe highly efficacious clear parasite stage . However , concern negative haemolytic side effect report full dose regimen individual G6PD deficient . Haemolytic side effect generally self-limiting , importantly , observed individual receive full dose PQ treatment ( 0.5 mg/kg , 14 day ) . Despite limitation PQ full-dose treatment , PQ also use clear gametocyte , clear asexual parasite different drug drug-combination . This gametocytocidal treatment require single dose PQ mention World Health Organization ( WHO ) beneficial area low malaria transmission . PQ short half-life 5-6 hour single dose 0.75mg/kg ( adult 45mg ) low cause haemolytic effect . According WHO standard , test G6PD deficiency therefore require . For study , propose use standard dose SP + AS clear asexual parasite , follow single dose PQ clear remain gametocyte . Pregnant woman child 1 year age exclude PQ treatment . Prior propose study , small scale clinical study conduct symptomatic child Korogwe determine safety gametocytocidal effect SP + AS SP + AS follow PQ ( NIMR/HQ/R.8a Vol . XIII/446 ; http : //www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN61534963 ) . We screen G6PD deficiency prior treatment pilot study observe side effect clinical indication anaemia child treat PQ . 1.3 MDA transmission block vaccine Apart direct benefit MDA malaria control tool , propose study scientific objective determine suitability several evaluation tool transmission block vaccine ( TBV ) . TBV work induce antibody react parasite surface antigen mosquito midgut blood meal . These immune response suppress infectivity mosquito therefore potentially prevent transmission . Although several group work production TBV , experience evaluation vaccine field . The evaluation TBV rather different evaluation conventional vaccine protects vaccinate individual directly . A TBV n't protect vaccinated individual community therefore evaluate community level . Limited available data regard protection community come study insecticide treat bed net . A successful MDA gametocytocidal drug could serve proof principle transmission block vaccine . A MDA study expect similar impact malaria transmission TBV : contact man mosquito influence , infectiousness human population mosquito reduce . Because similarity , need identical evaluation tool . An MDA therefore use test sensitivity suitability clinical biological measure . 2 . OBJECTIVES 1 . To determine impact mass drug administration gametocytocidal drug combination 1. malaria morbidity 2. parasite prevalence 3. human infectious reservoir 2 . To determine suitability outcome measure detect reduction malaria transmission 3 . To model impact MDA malaria transmission . 3 . WORK PLAN 3.1 Study area The propose study area area Lower Moshi part ongoing activity Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre/Joint Malaria Programme since 2002 The study area characterise low transmission intensity entomologic inoculation rate ( EIR ) 3.4 ( 95 % CI 0.7 - 9.9 ) infectious bite per person per year . Despite low transmission intensity , estimate 300-400 clinical malaria case occur yearly , predominantly transmission season . In area , 4 isolated village select , map census . Malaria transmission village characterise weekly mosquito catch two cross-sectional survey parasitological parameter . Villages comparable entomologic parasitological characteristic parasite carriage determine microscopy ( 1-3 % ) molecular detection technique ( 30-40 % ) equally distribute different age group ( NIMR/HQ/Vol.IX/343 ) . Two health facility exist study area , serve three village . The health facility participate passive case detection since February 2006 . For propose study , cluster define use complete map study area coordinate individual house map use geographical positioning system ( GPS ) . The minimum distance cluster 1 kilometer . MDA gametocytocidal drug combination undertake approximately 8 cluster , MDA placebo cluster . Migration study area carefully monitor community worker . Balozi 's actively involved part study . During cross-sectional study carry preparation phase study &gt; 98 % individual indicate permanent resident area sleep house every night year . Possible migration individual follow-up period include determine minimum coverage MDA . 3.2 Intervention mass drug administration Prior transmission season , individual receive either mass drug administration ( MDA ) placebo . This administration do irrespective presence parasite symptom . Treatment dosage sulphadoxine- pyrimethamine ( Fansidar , Roche , Switzerland : S 500mg/20kg ; P 25mg/20kg , day1 ) , artesunate ( Arsumax , Sanofi , France : 4mg/kg , day1,2,3 ) primaquine ( PQ base , Radboud University Nijmegen , The Netherlands : 0.75 mg/kg ) Pregnant woman child 1 year age exclude PQ treatment . 3.3 Evaluation intervention Primary outcome measure follow-up ) malaria morbidity , ii ) asexual parasite gametocyte prevalence , iii ) entomologic inoculation rate , iv ) human infectious reservoir . These measure determine several occasion 6 month . ) Malaria morbidity assess passive case detection two health centre active case detection random selection household . ii ) asexual parasite gametocyte prevalence density determine microscopic slide , rapid diagnostic test molecular quantitative nucleic acid sequence base amplification ( QT-NASBA ) cross-sectional survey . Serum also collect future analysis malaria antibody . iii ) entomologic inoculation rate determine mosquito catch CDC light-trap random selection house cluster . v ) human infectious reservoir determine offer venous blood sample ( 3mL ) locally rear Anopheles mosquito experimental set-up . The safety intervention determine selection child 1 week drug administration . Safety evaluation concentrate possible hemolysis , assess haemoglobin concentration measure hemocue haptoglobin concentration determine serum .</detailed_description>
