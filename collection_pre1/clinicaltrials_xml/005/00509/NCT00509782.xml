	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To determine toxicity maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ZIO-101 administer intravenously day 5 consecutive day every 4 week subject advance solid tumor . 2 . To determine pharmacokinetic profile ZIO-101 administer intravenously day 5 consecutive day every 4 week . Secondary Objective : 1 . To determine anti-tumor effect ZIO-101 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Trial ZIO-101 Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ZIO-101 drug may change cancerous cell healthy ( benign ) cell . It also design cause cancer cell destroy ; term call apoptosis . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test '' one week start study . These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete medical history physical exam , include measurement weight , blood pressure , pulse , temperature . You also ask medicine take general well-being . You electrocardiogram ( ECG - test measure electrical activity heart ) . Blood ( 2 1/2 tablespoon ) drawn . A sample urine also collect tested see kidney work correctly . Women able child must negative urine pregnancy test . To see current condition tumor , additional test may need perform already do recently . These test may include chest x-ray , CT scan ( image computer picture body ) , bone scan ( image test bone contrast material ) , MRI ( detailed imaging scan certain area body ) . If find eligible take part study , begin treatment ZIO-101 . Immediately treated ZIO-101 Day 0 , another physical exam ask medicine take feeling . You also ask series question ass mental health . This call mini-mental status exam take approximately 10 minute complete . The blood test may need repeat along ECG urine test . In addition , small blood sample ( 10 teaspoon ) must take immediately injection ZIO-101 . This blood use help measurement drug level blood . These call pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . This blood sample also use measure arsenic level blood . ZIO-101 inject vein 60 minute clinical translational research center UTMDACC . This drug must give special IV call central line catheter damage surround tissue . You sign separate consent document placement catheter perform . Special care take sure drug leak surround tissue . The use anti-nausea supportive care medication may give infusion . Following injection , 6 sample blood take PK test half hour 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 hour finish treatment . For next 4 day time first infusion , prepared treatment ZIO-101 . Before injection , ask feel , ECG perform , small sample blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PK test . The Day 1-4 infusion also take 1 hour . In total receive 5 daily injection ZIO-101 . On Day 4 end infusion , another sample blood drawn ( 5 teaspoon ) measure arsenic level blood . Your next visit Week 2 start visit , blood sample ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PK test , ask feel . At Week 3 , another blood sample ( 7 teaspoon ) draw PK test , measure arsenic level blood , ask feel . At Week 4 , new cycle begin . Immediately treat ZIO-101 , physical examination take mini-mental status examination ; ask medicine take feeling . The blood test repeat along ECG routine urine test . In addition , test measure tumor repeat . This study try find best dose ZIO-101 . At first , 3 patient assign first dose level . They follow evaluate side effect period 4 week 3 patient enrol . If none patient develop serious side effect , dose escalation continue . If 1 3 patient particular dose level develop significant side effect , 3 patient enrolled level . If 2 6 patient develop serious side effect , escalation finish future patient study treat low dose level ( half way level previous one ) . You may receive 6 cycle treatment . You may take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Once go study , end study visit . During visit , physical exam , mini-mental status exam blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This investigational study . ZIO-101 authorized FDA use research . ZIO-101 provide free charge study . Also , test procedures do solely purpose research study provide free charge . Up 50 patient take part multicenter study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
