	<brief_summary>Malaria responsible 2 million death year . The development efficient vaccine would present far best solution solve disastrous situation . Liver-Stage-Antigen-3 ( LSA-3 ) antigen mainly exhibit Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites liver-stage parasite . It characterize remarkable antigenicity human wide range variety B T-lymphocyte epitope , extremely high immunogenicity excellent protective efficacy sporozoite challenge animal model . Therefore , PfLSA-3-rec promise candidate vaccine P. falciparum humans The aim screen two different formulation recombinant malaria vaccine PfLSA-3-rec , one adjuvated aluminium hydroxide one Montanide Isa 720 , assess safety immunogenicity ( phase I ) profile formulation human , well protective efficacy follow sporozoite challenge ( phase IIa ) .</brief_summary>
