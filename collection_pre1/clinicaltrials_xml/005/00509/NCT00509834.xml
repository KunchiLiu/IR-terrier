	<brief_title>A Study Tolerability Early Efficacy hLF1-11 Patients With Proven Candidaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY Choice Drug Fluconazole consider `` standard care '' treatment Candida infection , include candidaemia hospitalize patient . Preclinical data demonstrate hLF1-11 posse potent antimycotic effect Candida sp , importantly , synergistic fluconazole , whereby Candida strain fluconazole-resistant become sensitive addition hLF1-11 Choice Patient Population Based preclinical data hLF1-11 show possess potent effect Candida albicans model vitro vivo . Furthermore , candidaemia ( bloodstream Candida infection ) one likely setting elicit therapeutic response since product present intravenous formulation As previously mention , fluconazole hLF1-11 exhibit synergistic effect preclinical study , whereby effect fluconazole enhance addition hLF1-11 .</detailed_description>
