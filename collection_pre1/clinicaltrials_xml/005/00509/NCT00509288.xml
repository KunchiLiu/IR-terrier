	<brief_summary>Background : - Human peripheral blood lymphocyte engineer express T-cell receptor ( TCR ) recognize blood type , HLA-A 0201 ( human leukocyte antigen ) derive gp100 protein . A retroviral vector construct deliver T-cell receptor ( TCR ) cell . - Patients ' cell convert cell able recognize fight melanoma tumor . Objectives : - To determine whether TCR-engineered lymphocyte put cell remove patient ' tumor blood reinfused , purpose shrink tumor . - To evaluate safety effectiveness treatment . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old metastatic cancer melanoma ( cancer spread beyond original site ) . - Patient 's leukocyte antigen type HLA-A 0201 . Design : -Patients undergo follow procedure : - Leukapheresis ( two occasion ) . This method collect large number white blood cell . The cell obtain first leukapheresis procedure grown laboratory , anti-MART-1 protein insert cell use inactivate ( harmless ) virus process call retroviral transduction . Cells collect second leukapheresis procedure use evaluate effectiveness study treatment . - Chemotherapy . Patients give chemotherapy vein ( intravenously , IV ) 1 hour 2 day suppress immune system patient 's immune cell interfere treatment . - Treatment anti-melanoma antigen recognize T-cells ( MART ) -1 . Patients receive intravenous ( IV ) infusion treat cell contain anti-MART-1 protein , follow infusion drug call IL-2 ( aldesleukin ) , help boost effectiveness treat white cell . - Patients give support medication prevent complication infection . - Patients may undergo tumor biopsy ( removal small piece tumor tissue ) . - Patients evaluated laboratory test image test , CT ( compute tomography ) scan , 4 6 week treatment month 3 4 month determine response treatment . - Patients blood test 3 , 6 , 12 month annually 5 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Metastatic Melanoma With Lymphodepleting Conditioning Infusion Anti-MART-1 F5 TCR-Gene-Engineered Lymphocytes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - We engineer human TIL ( tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ) peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBLs ) express anti-MART-1 T-cell receptor recognize HLA-A*0201 restrict epitope derive TIL clone DMF5 . - We construct single retroviral vector contain alpha beta chain mediate genetic transfer TCR high efficiency without need perform selection . - In co-cultures HLA-A*0201 positive melanoma , anti-MART-1 F5 TCR transduce T cell secrete significant amount interferon ( IFN ) -gamma ( significant secretion observe control co-cultures cell line . - The anti-MART-1 F5 TCR transduce T-cells could efficiently kill HLA-A*0201 positive tumor . There little recognition normal fibroblast cell . - This TCR 10 time reactive melanoma cell MART-1 TCR mediate tumor regression two patient metastatic melanoma . Objectives : Primary objective : -Determine administration anti-MART-1 F5 TCR -engineered peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL ) tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) aldesleukin patient follow nonmyeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic melanoma . Secondary objective : - Determine vivo survival TCR gene-engineered cell . - Determine toxicity profile treatment regimen . Eligibility : Patients HLA-A 0201 positive 18 year age old must : - metastatic melanoma ; - previously receive non-responder recurred aldesleukin ; - normal value basic laboratory value . Patients may : - concurrent major medical illness ; - form primary secondary immunodeficiency ; - severe hypersensitivity agent use study ; - contraindication high dose aldesleukin administration . Design : - If TIL obtain grown , non-reactive , patient assign receive TIL transduce anti-MART-1 F5 TCR retroviral vector . If TIL obtain , PBMC obtain leukapheresis ( approximately 5 X 10 ( 9 ) cell ) culture presence anti-CD3 ( OKT3 ) aldesleukin transduce anti-MART-1 F5 TCR retroviral vector . If TIL cell reactive autologous tumor major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) -matched tumor cell PBL grown , patient treat protocol . - Transduction initiated exposure approximately 10 ( 8 ) 5 time 10 ( 8 ) cell retroviral vector supernatant contain anti-MART-1 F5 TCR gene . These transduced cell expand tested anti-tumor activity . - Once engineer lymphocyte demonstrate biologically active accord strict criterion outline Certificate Analysis , patient receive nonmyeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow intravenous infusion ex vivo tumor reactive , TCR gene transduce cell plus IV aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg q8h maximum 15 dos ) . - Patients undergo complete evaluation tumor physical examination , CT chest , abdomen pelvis clinical laboratory evaluation four six week treatment monthly approximately 3 4 month study criterion meet . - The study conduct use phase II optimal design initially 21 evaluable patient enrol two cohort . If 0 1 21 patient per cohort experience clinical response , patient enrol 2 first 21 evaluable patient enrol cohort clinical response , accrual cohort continue total 41 evaluable patient enrol cohort . - The objective determine two cohort combination high dose aldesleukin , lymphocyte deplete chemotherapy , anti-MART-1 F5 TCR-gene engineer lymphocyte ( TIL PBL ) able associate clinical response rate rule 5 % ( p0=0.05 ) favor modest 20 % PR ( partial response ) + CR ( complete response ) rate ( p1=0.20 ) .</detailed_description>
