	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radioactive drug , iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine ( MIGB ) , may carry radiation directly tumor cell harm normal cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan vincristine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving iodine I 131 MIGB together irinotecan vincristine may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose iodine I 131 MIGB give together irinotecan vincristine treat young patient resistant relapse high-risk neuroblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>N2004-06 : Irinotecan Vincristine With 131I-MIBG Therapy Resistant/Relapsed High-Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine give combination fixed-dose irinotecan hydrochloride vincristine young patient refractory relapse high-risk neuroblastoma . - To determine dose-limiting toxicity iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine combine fixed-dose irinotecan hydrochloride vincristine . Secondary - To determine therapeutic response regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine ( ^131I-MIBG ) . Patients receive ^131I-MIBG IV 1½-2 hour day 1 , vincristine IV day 0 7 , irinotecan hydrochloride IV 1 hour day 0-4 7-11 . Treatment repeat every 56 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
