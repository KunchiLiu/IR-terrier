	<brief_title>Value Urodynamics Prior Stress Incontinence Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : multidisciplinary multicentre randomize control trial Study population/inclusion criterion : woman , previously operate stress incontinence , seek help urinary stress incontinence conservative therapy particular physiotherapy fail opt candidate surgical therapy ask participate study . Incontinence must demonstrate physical examination and/or micturition diary . Patients include gynaecologist urologist cooperate study . Intervention : consist non performance urodynamics studygroup . The control group undergo urodynamics present norm . In patient next item record inclusion : 1 . History clinical examination 2 . 48h-Bladder ( void incontinence ) diary , 3 . 48h-Pad test 4 . Validated Quality Life questionnaire ( SF 36 , Euroqol 5D , UDI , IIQ ) 5 . Urinalysis detection urinary tract infection . 6 . Residual urine measure ultrasound . At point interim decision make surgery . At moment patient inform study . After obtain informed consent patient randomly assign undergo urodynamic testing . In study group decision intervention base history clinical examination interim decision surgery . In control group decision base history clinical examination IN COMBINATION result urodynamic testing . It decision proceed surgery ( estimate 2/3rd woman ) conservative usually medication . The T0 ( moment intervention ) define moment first intervention definition surgery study group either surgery conservative control group . After intervention additional therapy possible arm . The follow-up period 24 month T0 , parameters pre-operative assessed . These item assess : 6 week post intervention ( PI ) 3 month PI 6 month PI 12 month PI 24 month PI Urodynamics , control group , perform accord ICS standard consist free flow , fillingscystometry , pressure flow study urethral pressure profilometry rest stress . The outcome match urodynamic finding indicate possible useful part urodynamic finding . Post operative urodynamics NOT part study . The primary outcome study improvement Urogenital Distress Inventory ( UDI ) 24 month baseline power calculation perform use non-inferiority assumption . The mean improvement UDI group expect 35 standard deviation 10 . ( 22 ) A difference mean improvement 8 less consider non-inferior . As condition allow one third total group ( woman non-UDI group , would operatively treat ) , result difference mean improvement 2.7 less UDI non-UDI group . Then effectively 130 woman group need reach power 70 % use one-sided test 0.05 . Considering expect percentage lose follow ca . 10 % , total 290 woman ( 145 group ) include study . Multivariate analysis covariance group , centre baseline covariate independent variable use estimate difference improvement UDI 24 month group 95 % confidence interval . As UDI skew , data logtransformed prior analysis . Other variable ( ie Incontinence Impact Questionnaire ) analyse similar . Economic evaluation : For patient , utilisation health care service record prospectively , use Case Record Forms , include urodynamic testing , surgery SUI , re-operations , medical treatment detrusor instability , care urinary incontinence , care urinary retention . By multiply volume care unit cost price , direct medical cost incur SUI follow period calculate patient . For unit cost price , national guideline use ( CVZ , 2004 ) . For cost care urinary incontinence urinary retention , data literature use , converted 2006 price . We incorporate health relate quality life questionnaire euroqol 5D study able calculate QALYs ( quality-adjusted life-years ) , measure health outcome . A QALY change quality life induce treatment multiplied duration treatment effect provide number QALYs gain . QALYs related medical cost arrive final common denominator cost/QALY . This parameter use compare cost-effectiveness treatment .</detailed_description>
