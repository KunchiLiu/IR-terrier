	<brief_summary>In trial , subject chemo-naive advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) assign chemotherapy use genomic-based predictor platinum sensitivity . After amendment date 1/25/2010 , subject squamous cell NSCLC sensitive cisplatin receive cisplatin/gemcitabine resistant cisplatin receive docetaxel/gemcitabine . Subjects non-squamous cell NSCLC sensitive cisplatin receive cisplatin/pemetrexed resistant cisplatin receive pemetrexed/gemcitabine . The primary objective trial prospectively validate genomic-based prediction model separate evaluation one-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) cisplatin-sensitive cisplatin-resistant cohort . Secondary objective include : assessment overall time progressive disease , quality life evaluation drug sensitivity pattern cisplatin pemetrexed .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Using Genomic Predictor Platinum Resistance Guide Therapy Stage IIIB/IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death men woman . The majority patient lung cancer non-small cell type ( NSCLC ) . The current standard care treat select stage IIIB stage IV NSCLC doublet chemotherapy regimen , cisplatin plus gemcitabine , carboplatin plus paclitaxel , platinum agent plus vinorelbine . All regimens comparable response rate first-line therapy . In addition , combination cisplatin plus pemetrexed recently approve non-squamous histology , base result large randomized prospective trial advance stage NSCLC . Alternative doublet therapy first-line treatment NSCLC per ASCO NCCN guideline also include non-platinum doublet single agent therapy . An individual patient 's response chemotherapy result complex interaction drug ( ) patient 's genetics environment . Using Affymetrix gene expression data correspond drug response data cisplatin NCI60 line panel , gene expression base model predicative cisplatin-resistant developed . However , reevaluation genomics-based prediction model show irreproducible , suggest inaccurate patient assignment two cisplatin cohort . As result , would inappropriate separately analyze outcome different treatment group . Instead , information cisplatin cohort combine reflect overall measure one-year progression-free survival study . Secondary outcome also reflect overall measure median time disease progression quality life .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Suspected histologic/cytologic select stage IIIB IV NSCLC , amenable curative treatment surgery XRT . Histologic/cytologic documentation recurrence require patient previously completely resect metastatic disease . Fresh frozen tissue must available generate apply genomics predictor . If obtain time diagnosis , subject must consent another biopsy fresh tissue sample must yield adequate high quality RNA . Patients symptomatic brain metastasis must complete brain XRT neurologically stable ( steroid permit ) prior research biopsy . If patient prior XRT therapy , fresh frozen tissue biopsy genomics analysis must outside XRT field . At least one , nonradiated , measurable lesion RECIST criterion . ECOG performance status 0 1 . NO prior chemo , biologic target therapy malignancy . Prior therapy low dose methotrexate similar medication allow use nonmalignant condition . Prior XRT therapy permit ≥1 week since completion XRT ( ≥2 week whole brain XRT ) . XRT must &lt; 25 % bone marrow reserve . Age ≥18 year . No previous concomitant malignancy past 5 year surgical management carcinoma situ cervix , breast , NSCLC , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . No serious medical psychiatric illness . Signed informed consent . Required lab data within 2 week enrollment : 1 . ANC/AGC ≥1500 per uL 2 . Platelets ≥100,000 per uL 3 . Total bili ≤1.5 mg/dL 4 . Creatinine ≤2 mg/dL ; creatinine clearance ≥45 ml/min . 5 . SGOT/SGPT ≤3x ULN except presence know hepatic mets ( may 5x ULN ) unless receive docetaxel/gemcitabine SGOT/SGPT ≤1.5x ULN . Females childbearing potential ( surgically sterilize menarche 1 year post menopause ) must test negative pregnancy within 7 day prior time enrollment base serum pregnancy test . Both sexually active male female reproductive potential must agree use reliable method birth control , determine patient health care team , study 3 month follow last dose study drug . Treatment within last 30 day drug receive regulatory approval indication time study entry . Concurrent administration antitumor therapy ( see # 5 inclusion exception ) . Inability comply protocol study procedure . Active infection require IV antibiotic , antifungal antiviral agent , opinion investigator would compromise patient 's ability tolerate therapy . Untreated CNS metastasis unless brain XRT complete neurologically stable ( steroid permit ) . Major surgery within 2 week study serious concomitant systemic disorder would compromise safety patient patient 's ability complete study . MI occur less 6 month inclusion , know uncontrolled arrhythmia , symptomatic angina pectoris , active ischemia cardiac failure control med . Contraindications corticosteroid . Inability/unwillingness take folic acid vitamin B12 . Unwillingness stop take herbal supplement study . Presence clinically significant thirdspace fluid collection ( example , ascites pleural effusion ) control drainage procedure prior treatment initiation throughout study enrollment .
