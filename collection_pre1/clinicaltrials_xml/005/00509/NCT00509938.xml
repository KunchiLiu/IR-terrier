	<brief_summary>The safety tolerability hLF 1-11 establish first HSCT recipient risk developing , yet develop , infectious complication due invasive fungal disease . These patient different healthy volunteer receive myeloablative treatment arrest haematopoiesis result neutropenia also induce mucosal barrier injury predispose infection typically occur week transplant . It therefore essential know hLF 1-11 give neutropenia mucosal barrier injury infection ensue</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Single Dose 5 mg hLF1-11 Given Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Human lactoferrin ( hLF ) glycoprotein contain 692 amino acid find saliva , milk , tear , body fluid . Peptide represent first cationic domain , i.e . peptide comprise first eleven residue hLF ( referred hLF1-11 ) significantly effective full length hLF peptide represent second cationic domain kill variety bacteria vivo . The mechanism action comprise number independent factor . The classical way explain efficacy direct kill effect , typically observe vitro relatively high concentration . The result vitro vivo experiment suggest mechanism action predominantly intermediary cell and/or component host oppose direct interaction pathogen . The objective develop hLF1-11 effective safe antibacterial antifungal treatment fungal bacterial infection develop neutropenia result myeloablative therapy prepare haematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) formerly refer bone marrow transplant . Rates infection relate morbidity high population make attractive target test clinically proof-of-principle hLF1-11 provide effective treatment . Subsequently , hLF1-11 developed systemic antifungal agent .</detailed_description>
