	<detailed_description>The clinical trial , title `` Safety performance evaluation electro-stimulator mount intra-oral removable appliance ( GenNarino ) treatment xerostomia '' prospective , randomize , double-blind , sham-controlled multi-center trial , follow open-label study . Study subject patient xerostomia . The purpose trial test safety efficacy electrostimulation use GenNarino device . The primary endpoint significant symptomatic improvement , secondary one , increase salivary output event free use ( adverse side-effects ) . The clinical follow-up consist periodic clinical examination . In clinical trial use device compare active vs. sham mode one month double-blind design ( Stage I ) . Thereafter , Stage II xerostomia relieve effect active device assess open label design additional 6 month . Clinic- home-based questionnaire whole saliva collection perform .</detailed_description>
