	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study chemotherapy see well work without bevacizumab treat patient head neck squamous cell carcinoma come back ( recurrent ) spread part body ( metastatic ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , cisplatin , carboplatin , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Bevacizumab may also make tumor cell sensitive chemotherapy stop growth head neck cancer block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy effective give without bevacizumab treat patient head neck squamous cell carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival patient recurrent metastatic head neck cancer treat standard platinum-based chemotherapy without bevacizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity addition bevacizumab platinum-doublet ( cisplatin/docetaxel , carboplatin/docetaxel , cisplatin/fluorouracil [ 5-FU ] , carboplatin/5-FU ) . II . To compare objective response rate progression-free survival achieve therapy . III . To collect blood sample therapy future correlative study . IV . To collect tumor tissue sample available baseline prior diagnostic procedure future correlative study . OUTLINE : After physician decides chemotherapy doublet use , patient randomize 1 2 treatment arm chemotherapy combination . ARM IA : Patients receive chemotherapy comprise docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour cisplatin IV 1-2 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM IB : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 docetaxel cisplatin Arm IA . ARM IIA : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM IIB : Patients receive bevacizumab arm IB docetaxel carboplatin Arm IIA . ARM IIIA : Patients receive cisplatin IV 1-2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously day 1-4 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM IIIB : Patients receive bevacizumab Arm IB cisplatin fluorouracil Arm IIIA . ARM IVA : Patients receive carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously day 1-4 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM IVB : Patients receive bevacizumab Arm IB carboplatin fluorouracil Arm IVA . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
