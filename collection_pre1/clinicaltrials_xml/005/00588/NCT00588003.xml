	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot study see take anastrozole ( Arimidex ) 10 day cause change breast cancer cell . Anastrozole ( Arimidex ) drug use treatment type breast cancer depend estrogen grow . This type breast cancer call estrogen receptor positive breast cancer . Anastrozole ( Arimidex ) work block enzyme body call aromatase . Aromatase find muscle , fat , liver breast tumor . This enzyme important make estrogen woman longer menstrual period . Anastrozole decrease level estrogen body . We interested see take anastrozole 10 day cause change breast cancer cell . We study cell process make new blood vessel , quickly cell multiply , soon die . We also study gene breast cancer tissue turn take anastrozole 10 day .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Postmenopausal patient , define one follow criterion : Documented history bilateral oophorectomy , Aged 60 year , Aged 4559 year satisfy one follow criterion : Amenorrhea least 12 month intact uterus Amenorrhea le 12 month follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) concentration within postmenopausal range include : patient hysterectomy patient receive hormone replacement therapy past . Clinically palpable nonpalpable T1c great , ER positive invasive breast cancer diagnose outside core biopsy . Outside diagnosis invasive breast cancer confirm MSKCC Palpable nonpalpable breast mass &gt; 1cm highly suspicious invasive breast cancer base mammographic , ultrasound and/or physical examination finding amenable diagnostic core biopsy . Core biopsy diagnosis ER positive invasive breast cancer perform MSKCC Breast conserve surgery mastectomy schedule MSKCC . Informed consent obtain . Comorbid condition would preclude use aromatase inhibitor : previous hypersensitivity , severe hepatic insufficiency ( SGOT SGPT three time upper limit normal ) , severe renal insufficiency ( creatinine clearance &lt; 10ml/min ) . Prior radiation therapy chest wall / breast . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy Hormone replacement therapy , tamoxifen raloxifene treatment within past 3 month ER negative breast cancer History active malignancy within previous 5 year ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer breast cancer )</criteria>
