	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Cediranib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving irinotecan together cediranib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II clinical trial study well give irinotecan together cediranib work treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer respond previous oxaliplatin , fluoropyrimidine , bevacizumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan Cediranib Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer That Did Not Respond Previous Oxaliplatin , Fluoropyrimidine , Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine proportion patient free progression 12 week start second-line therapy . Secondary - To determine objective response rate . - To determine overall survival . - To define dose safety profile irinotecan hydrochloride cediranib . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute day 1 8 oral cediranib daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year study entry .</detailed_description>
