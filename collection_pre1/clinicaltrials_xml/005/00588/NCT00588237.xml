	<brief_summary>The purpose study test whether safe treat cancer 3 drug instead 2 drug . After surgery , cancer typically treat 2 drug call cisplatin paclitaxel ( also know Taxol ) . Cisplatin give port belly , Taxol give belly port vein ( IV ) . Large clinical study show treatment give best result woman cancer . This treatment , however , also cause many side effect , especially belly pain , nerve injury , lower immune system , infection risk . In study ask join , dose Cisplatin low order try lessen problem . This study also test safety add 3rd drug call bevacizumab ( also know Avastin ) . This drug show shrink ovarian , peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer patient advance disease , despite receive prior treatment cancer . Therefore , may also effective patient , like , new diagnosis . Unfortunately , Avastin cause dangerous side effect woman advance cancer . For instance , cause hole intestine , increase risk blood clot stroke . Avastin give time IP therapy , know safe effective combination . In study , IV Avastin give addition IP cisplatin , IP Taxol , IV Taxol , patient like chemotherapy . This study aim find effect , good and/or bad , combination drug body type cancer .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must sign approve informed consent . Subjects histologic diagnosis epithelial ovarian carcinoma , primary peritoneal carcinoma , fallopian tube carcinoma , Stage II III , optimal ( ≤ equal 1 cm residual disease ) residual disease follow initial surgery . All subject must appropriate surgery ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube carcinoma appropriate tissue available histologic evaluation confirm diagnosis stage . Pathology must verify Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center . Subjects follow histologic epithelial cell type eligible : Serous adenocarcinoma , endometrioid adenocarcinoma , mucinous adenocarcinoma , undifferentiated carcinoma , clear cell adenocarcinoma , mixed epithelial carcinoma , transitional cell carcinoma , malignant Brenner 's Tumor , adenocarcinoma N.O.S . Subjects must Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥ equal 70 % . Subjects must enter 12 week postoperatively . Bone marrow function : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ equal 1,500/µl ( equivalent Common Toxicity Criteria ( CTC ) Grade 1 ) Platelets ≥ equal 100,000/µl ( CTC Grade 01 ) Renal function : Creatinine ≤ equal 1.5 mg/dl Hepatic function : Bilirubin ≤ equal 1.5 x ULN ( CTC Grade 1 ) AST ≤ equal 2.5 x ULN ( CTC Grade 1 ) Neurologic function : Neuropathy ( sensory ) ≤ CTC Grade 1 Urine Protein Creatinine : Urine protein creatinine ( UPC ) ratio must &lt; 1.0 gm . If UPC ratio &gt; equal 1 , collection 24hour urine measurement urine protein recommend part patient 's medical management offstudy . * UPC ratio spot urine estimation 24 urine protein excretion UPC ratio 1 roughly equivalent 24hour urine protein 1 gm . UPC ratio calculate use one follow formula : [ urine protein ] / [ urine creatinine ] protein creatinine report mg/dL [ ( urine protein ) x0.088 ] / [ urine creatinine ] urine creatinine report mmol/L The UPCR find correlate directly amount protein excreted 24 hour urine collection . Specifically , UPCR 1.0 equivalent 1.0 gram protein 24 hour urine collection . Obtain least 4 ml random urine sample sterile container ( 24 hour urine ) . Send sample lab request urine protein creatinine level [ separate request ] . The lab measure protein concentration ( mg/dL ) creatinine concentration ( mg/dL ) . The UPCR derive follow : protein concentration ( mg/dL ) /creatinine ( mg/dL ) . Patients must UPCR &lt; 1.0 allow participation study . Blood coagulation parameter : PT international normalize ratio ( INR ) &lt; equal 1.5 ( inrange INR , usually 2 3 , patient stable dose therapeutic warfarin ) PTT &lt; 1.2 time upper limit normal . Patients childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test prior study entry practice effective form contraception study least 6 month receive final treatment bevacizumab . Patients must Intraperitoneal ( IP ) port place . If patient IP port , must willing undergo surgical placement one . Subjects current diagnosis epithelial ovarian tumor low malignant potential ( borderline carcinoma ) eligible . Subjects prior diagnosis low malignant potential tumor surgically resect subsequently develop invasive adenocarcinoma eligible , provide receive prior chemotherapy ovarian tumor . Subjects receive prior radiotherapy portion abdominal cavity pelvis exclude . Prior radiation localize cancer breast , head neck , skin permit , provide complete 3 year prior enrollment , subject remain free recurrent metastatic disease . Subjects receive prior chemotherapy abdominal pelvic tumor exclude . Subjects may receive prior adjuvant chemotherapy localize breast cancer , provide complete 3 year prior enrollment , subject remain free recurrent metastatic disease . Patients synchronous primary endometrial cancer , history primary endometrial cancer , exclude unless follow condition meet : 1 . Stage great IB . 2 . Less 3 mm invasion without vascular lymphatic invasion 3 . No poorly differentiate subtypes , include papillary serous , clear cell FIGO grade 3 lesion Patients suboptimal ( &gt; 1 cm ) residual disease , determine operative surgeon . Patients receive targeted therapy ( include limit vaccine , antibody , tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) hormonal therapy management ovarian , peritoneal primary , fallopian tube cancer . With exception nonmelanoma skin cancer specific malignancy note , subject invasive malignancy ( ) evidence cancer present within last 5 year whose previous cancer treatment contraindicate protocol therapy exclude . Subjects acute hepatitis . Subjects active infection require parenteral antibiotic . Patients serious , nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture eligible . This include history abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation intraabdominal abscess within 28 day . Patients granulate incision heal secondary intention evidence fascial dehiscence infection eligible require weekly wound examination . Patients active bleed pathologic condition carry high risk bleeding , know bleed disorder , coagulopathy , tumor involve major vessel . Patients history evidence upon physical examination CNS disease , include primary brain tumor , seizures control standard medical therapy , brain metastasis , history cerebrovascular accident ( CVA , stroke ) , transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) subarachnoid hemorrhage within 6 month first date treatment study . Patients clinically significant cardiovascular disease . This include : 1 . Uncontrolled hypertension , define systolic &gt; 150 mm Hg diastolic &gt; 90 mm Hg 2 .
