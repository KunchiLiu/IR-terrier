	<brief_summary>The purpose study find whether new device help obtain accurate CT PET scan lung chest tumor liver liver tumor help deliver radiation therapy . When breathe , amount air lung change . Lung tumor may also move breathing . Liver tumor may also move breathing ; lung inflate , liver push . A CT scan ( special type X-ray ) routinely obtain part plan lung liver radiation therapy . Since patient breathe CT scan lung liver tumor move , CT scan sometimes inaccurate . We test device obtain CT additional PET scan patient breathe . This hopefully allow u deliver radiation accuracy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Breathing Synchronized CT PET Scans Radiation Therapy Treatment Planning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective measure amount tumor motion respiration , measure change tumor definition breathe synchronize PET compare standard free breathing PET , determine fraction patient whose radiation treatment plan would modify base information . Eligible patient receive radiation treatment thoracic liver tumor .</detailed_description>
