	<brief_summary>In study , want find likely temozolomide shrink melanoma tumor spread area could remove surgery . We also want study melanoma temozolomide treatment learn tumor respond others . This Phase II trial . This mean test drug - case , temozolomide -- already study show safe . Surgery , possible , main treatment patient melanoma like . In people , however , melanoma cell already spread place body . This mean even surgery , many people melanoma come back . This often fatal . One goal trial treat melanoma cell might spread chance grow . As part trial , also study gene turn gene turn tumor . We obtain tumor biopsy do start temozolomide treatment tumor remove surgery do finish temozolomide treatment . This may help u understand temozolomide work recognize tumor respond . Before temozolomide treatment , also test new way measure amount tumor present . This involve special way analyze CT scan anyway . This new technique may allow u see tumor shrinkage early treatment course .</brief_summary>
