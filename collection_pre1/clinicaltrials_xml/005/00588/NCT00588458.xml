	<brief_summary>The reason study see new radiologic technique call computerized tomographic cholangiography ( CT cholangiography ) could helpful demonstrate bile duct feature measure amount space bile duct canal fill bile fluid . It may useful find well finding correlate previously know clinical predictor term clinical outcome happen future patient primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Value CT Cholangiography Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prognostic model , produce base clinical , histological biochemical feature , useful predict survival determine timing liver transplantation . Preliminary feasibility study patient PSC use high resolution CT contrast agent ( CT cholangiography ) , show excellent depiction bile duct . CT cholangiography also potential allow quantification intraductal volume use sophisticated computer program . This assessment may important clinical feature ass disease severity progression.The information cholangiographic feature could important therapeutic decision ( e.g. , determine usefulness balloon dilatation stenting dominant extrahepatic duct stricture ) , counsel patient , therapeutic trial stratify patient assess efficacy treatment .</detailed_description>
