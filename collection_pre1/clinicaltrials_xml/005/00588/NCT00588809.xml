	<brief_title>Selumetinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate ( include complete response-CR , complete response incomplete count recovery CRi , partial response-PR , minor response-MR ) AZD6244 ( selumetinib ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect AZD6244 AML sample p-ERK evaluate potential utility p-ERK inhibition surrogate marker biologic activity . II . To correlate effect AZD6244 presence ( absence ) mutate RAS FLT-3 baseline . III . To assess safety profile AZD6244 patient AML . OUTLINE : Patients receive selumetinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1 -28 . Treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 52 week .</detailed_description>
