	<brief_title>Capsaicin Cough Threshold Chronic Cough Due Postnasal Drip</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective protocol determine pathogenesis cough disease aerodigestive tract . There 24 million ambulatory chronic cough visit nationally 1991 8,000 visit 2004 MCR . Current guideline chronic cough base case series empirical expert opinion . Studies implicate mucosal inflammation , heighten sensitivity capsaicin cough receptor peripheral nerve elaboration inflammatory mediator include tussigenic neuropeptides . There gap knowledge trigger cough many disease state . For example , postnasal drip syndrome estimate account 70 % chronic cough , yet know patient postnasal drip chronic cough . Our hypothesis must critical factor/s cause cough one patient postnasal drip another . This study evaluate whether exists difference capsaicin cough sensitivity , neuropeptides level mucosal inflammation patient postnasal drip chronic cough compare natural control group , subject postnasal drip without chronic cough . After standard therapy eliminate postnasal drip , repeat measurement capsaicin sensitivity nitric oxide level obtain . There critical need determine mechanisms underlying cough well management . The study result provide insight fill gap knowledge serve advance future work evaluate mechanisms cough disease state include asthma , GERD , interstitial lung disease smoker .</detailed_description>
