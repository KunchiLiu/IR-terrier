	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Cellular adoptive immunotherapy use person 's white blood cell treat laboratory stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Aldesleukin may help laboratory-treated white blood cell stay body longer . Drugs use chemotherapy , zoledronic acid , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving cellular adoptive immunotherapy together interleukin-2 zoledronic acid may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect give cellular adoptive immunotherapy together aldesleukin zoledronic acid see well work treat patient stage IV kidney cancer lung metastasis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety adoptive immunotherapy comprise 2-methyl-3-butenyl-1-pyrophosphate-stimulated gamma delta ( gd ) T cell , zoledronate , IL-2 nephrectomy , especially regard incidence frequency adverse event . - Determine duration vivo persistence transfer gd T cell patient . - Determine double time tumor growth adoptive immunotherapy . - Determine tumor-size reduce effect adoptive immunotherapy base Best Overall Response Chart . OUTLINE : Patients undergo leukapheresis harvest peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) . PBMCs stimulate 2-methyl-3-butenyl-1-pyrophosphate aldesleukin 11 day . Patients receive expand Gamma Delta T cell , aldesleukin , zoledronic acid month 6 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month .</detailed_description>
