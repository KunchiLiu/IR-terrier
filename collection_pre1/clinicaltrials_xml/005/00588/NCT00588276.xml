	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate low oxygen area call hypoxia within tumor . These low oxygen area think reason tumor resistant radiation treatment . A tracer extremely small quantity substance . Tracer radioactivity attach may use `` trace '' event body . A tracer call iodo-azomycin galactopyranoside ( *IAZGP ) appear able detect low oxygen area within tumor . Radioactive iodine molecule detect imaging technique call PET scan . This present study involve obtain three scan use new imaging technique . The goal carry many scan determine scan best show area tumor may low level oxygen .</brief_summary>
