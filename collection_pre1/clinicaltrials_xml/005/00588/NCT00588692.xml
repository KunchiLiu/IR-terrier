	<brief_summary>Heart failure ( HF ) lead cause hospitalization among Americans age 65 year , affect great 5 million U.S. alone . Significant improvement morbidity mortality achieve use medication antagonize adverse neurohormonal signaling pathway , particularly therapy reduce leave ventricular ( LV ) afterload . Vascular stiffness increase age , contribute increase cardiac load . One important repercussion stiffen increase pulse wave velocity . As incident pressure wave generate cardiac ejection encounter zone impedance mismatch ( arterial bifurcation ) , part wave reflect backward , sum incident wave , increase central blood pressure ( CBP ) . With normal age , hypertension , heart failure , increase wave velocity cause reflect wave reach heart earlier , mid late systole , considerably increase late-systolic load , impair cardiac ejection , diastolic relaxation ensue cardiac cycle . The magnitude reflect pressure wave quantify augmentation index ( AIx ) . The use vasoactive agent antagonize increase late systolic load ( AIx ) may prove useful treatment heart failure , facilitate cardiac ejection late systole reflect pressure wave predominate . However , never conclusively show human CBP-targeted therapy useful management HF . LV afterload , measure centrally ascend aorta , may differ considerably brachial cuff-measured pressure , traditionally require invasive hemodynamic assessment determine , limit applicability technique target CBP late-systolic load . Recently , novel , hand-held tonometer ( SphygmoCor , Atcor Medical ) develop noninvasive assessment CBP . This pencil-like device apply radial artery , use validated mathematical transformation derive central aortic pressure . This device receive FDA approval clinical use assessment central pressure . However , remain unknown whether knowledge CBP late-systolic load ( AIx ) confer clinically-significant incremental benefit management patient heart failure . The primary objective propose investigation determine assessment might role .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Design Methods Hypotheses Knowledge central aortic pressure waveform ( central pressure therapy , CPT ) affect intensity antihypertensive medication prescription , treatment decision base upon knowledge turn lead enhance reduction CBP AIx . Finally , hypothesize reduction AIx/CBP lead improve exercise performance LV systolic diastolic reserve function . Basic Study Plan This single-blind , randomize , control , parallel group intervention study examine effect novel , noninvasive diagnostic test determine AIx CBP ( SphygmoCor , Atcor Medical ) medical care , blood pressure control , exercise performance , LV functional reserve patient chronic heart failure ( HF ) systolic dysfunction ( 25 % &lt; EF &lt; 50 % ) preserve systolic function ( EF &gt; 50 % ) . Eligible subject undergo rest echocardiogram , noninvasive CBP assessment , metabolic exercise stress test recumbent cycle ergometer quantify exercise performance . Echocardiography CBP assessment perform rest , grade exercise , immediately peak exercise determine index LV systolic diastolic performance change CBP . Subjects randomize ( 1:1 ) subsequent determination CBP 1 month heart failure clinic visit versus sham ( tonometry information acquire , share investigator ) . Investigators make adjustment subject 's medical therapy antihypertensive regimen base upon additional data procure via Sphygmocor device . Subjects randomize sham adjustment make per standard clinical judgment base upon brachial blood pressure assessment clinical variable . In addition standard clinical assessment , subject undergo 6 minute walk test visit , administer study coordinator . At 6 month follow visit , subject undergo rest exercise echo/CBP/metabolic stress test exactly perform visit 1 . The co-primary endpoint change central augmentation index ( define ) change peak oxygen uptake ( VO2 ) baseline . Secondary endpoint include change rest exercise-induced CBP brachial blood pressure , number antihypertensive medication prescribe , rest exercise change LV systolic diastolic function ( see ) , change : cardiac output , exercise time , anaerobic threshold , minute ventilation ( VE ) carbon dioxide produce ( VCO2 ) slope ( ventilatory efficiency ) . There total 7 visit , first last exercise testing ; intervene 5 visit routine heart failure clinic follow appointment .</detailed_description>
