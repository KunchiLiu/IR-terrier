	<detailed_description>The folate receptor over-expressed many type cancer cell RA model , new folate receptor target therapy develop target cancer cell over-express folate receptor . As targeted therapy , important develop diagnostic test provide accurate information folate receptor status aid select patient may benefit folate-targeted therapy . EC20 concentrate extremity liver spleen rat adjuvant induced arthritis . The increased uptake mediate overexpressed folate receptor macrophage , intensity uptake greatly reduce addition excess folate , support specificity uptake . Depletion macrophages greatly reduce folate receptor abolishes uptake EC20 . This suggest EC20 may useful assess macrophage involvement active inflammatory process RA , perhaps systemic immune mediate disorder well . FolateScan may allow clinician get accurate real-time data receptor binding , less invasive manner , actively inflame site throughout treatment regimen . This kind information may help physician make good clinical decision regard therapy , include folate target therapy .</detailed_description>
