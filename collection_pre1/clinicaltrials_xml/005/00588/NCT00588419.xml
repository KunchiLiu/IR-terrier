	<detailed_description>This study entitle `` The Quantification Breast Sensations Following Postmastectomy Breast Reconstruction '' evaluate recovery sensation reconstruct well nonreconstructed breast . Touch , vibration , pain temperature sensation objectively evaluate great 1 year follow completion reconstruction . Breast sensation follow immediate , tissue expander/implant breast reconstruction compare follow immediate , autogenous tissue reconstruction . A formal sensory examination perform . SemmesWeinstein monofilaments evaluate touchpressure sensation breast . A Bioesthesiometer determine recovery vibratory sensation . Temperature sensation evaluate application warm cool stimulus . Superficial pain sensation evaluate application sharp dull stimulus . A patient report assessment sensory change breast administered patient . The Breast Sensation Assessment Scale Â© design measure prevalence , severity , distress 18 different sensory symptom follow breast surgery . A `` Patient Demographic Treatment Information Form '' patient ' medical record use obtain demographic treatment data . The role confound variable ( include : patient age , breast volume , axillary procedure perform adjuvant therapy receive ) recovery sensation evaluate . The estimate accrual time study 12 month .</detailed_description>
