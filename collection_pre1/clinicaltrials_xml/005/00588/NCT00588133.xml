	<brief_title>A Preliminary Study New Tranexamic Acid Dosing Schedule Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tranexamic acid administer intravenously prevent bleeding associate cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass . The current dosing regimen tranexamic acid empirically derive base upon pharmacokinetics normal patient receive drug . We develop assay tranexamic acid find plasma concentration tranexamic acid varies greatly patient also time within patient , especially patient renal insufficiency . We develop alternative dosing schedule tranexamic acid incorporate effect renal function tranexamic acid concentration . The objective preliminary study determine new dose schedule achieve desire plasma concentration tranexamic acid reduce intra inter patient variability tranexamic acid plasma concentration relative current dosing schedule . The result study used large subsequent study level plasma tranexamic acid concentration need prevent bleed transfusion blood product patient undergo cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
