	<brief_title>Diagnostic Accuracy Capsule Endoscopy Small Bowel Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims : The aim study follow : 1 ) describe spectrum small intestinal lesion demonstrate capsule endoscopy ( CE ) patient Crohn 's disease ; 2 ) determine inter-observer agreement recognize small intestinal lesion ; 3 ) determine sensitivity , positive predictive value , accuracy CE , CT enterography , small bowel follow-through , colonoscopy ileoscopy , pairwise combination examination consensus clinical diagnosis diagnosis evaluation extent severity small intestinal Crohn 's disease ; 4 ) establish Crohn 's Disease Capsule Endoscopy Index Severity ( CDCEIS ) ; 5 ) describe spectrum right colon lesion demonstrate CE patient Crohn 's disease . Study Design Methods : Consecutive adult patient suspect definite Crohn 's disease see Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinic Mayo Clinic Rochester offer enrollment prospective observational trial compare CE CT enterography , small bowel follow-through , colonoscopy , consensus clinical diagnosis Crohn 's disease . Seventy patient enrol , accord inclusion exclusion criterion , write informed consent obtain . Co-investigators Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) Clinic clinically evaluate patient , include history limited physical examination . Patients undergo clinically indicated laboratory test . Serum store patient potential laboratory study . Patients complete retrospective symptom diary week prior evaluation Mayo , Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) calculate . All patient CT enterography peroral contrast interpret co-investigator radiologist . All patient undergo clinically indicate colonoscopy ileoscopy staff co-investigator ( C.A.S . staff co-investigator interpret CE ) , Crohn 's Disease Endoscopic Index Severity ( CDEIS ) calculate . If significant small bowel stricture identify CT enterography colonoscopy ileoscopy , patient subsequently undergo CE . All CE study read separately C.A.S . ( gastroenterology fellow ) supervise staff gastroenterologist co-investigator , blind 's interpretation . The interobserver agreement C.A.S . co-investigator staff determine . Patients lastly clinically indicate small bowel follow-through interpreted co-investigator radiologist . All co-investigators blind result image modality interpret respective study . Following imaging procedure , interpret physician complete small intestine colon anatomy form . The physician identify type lesion present also give global evaluation severity lesion find global Crohn 's disease activity score indicate one following : active Crohn 's disease , suspicious Crohn 's disease , inactive Crohn 's disease , evidence Crohn 's disease . Co-investigators represent diagnostic modality meet periodically review case disagreement among image procedure respect extent severity small intestinal Crohn 's disease order reach consensus clinical diagnosis . This consensus clinical diagnosis serve gold standard individual imaging modality evaluate . Sensitivity , positive predictive value , accuracy diagnostic modality compare consensus clinical diagnosis determine . A Crohn 's disease capsule endoscopy index severity ( CDCEIS ) create CE study review investigator referral center inside outside United States determine inter-observer agreement ( reproducibility ) type small bowel lesion identify CE . Logistic regression analysis step-wise deletion utilized create CDCEIS use lesion reproducible , global Crohn 's disease endoscopic activity score CE dependent variable .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Outpatient either sex age 18 70 year Patient suspect definite Crohn 's disease Patient read , understood , sign write informed consent form visit 1 . Pregnancy Patients prisoner , institutionalized individual , vulnerable adult Patients immediately need abdominal surgery active gastrointestinal bleeding , peritonitis , intestinal obstruction , perforation , intraabdominal abscess Patients know suspected gastrointestinal obstruction due significant stricture base upon clinical symptom ( nausea , vomit , abdominal distention , abdominal pain ) confirm preprocedure evaluation . Preprocedure evaluation include CT enterography small bowel follow perform Mayo previously outside institution demonstrate mechanical obstruction ( mechanical obstruction define small bowel narrow prestenotic dilatation ) ; additionally , highgrade stenotic ileocecal valve ileocolonic anastomosis find colonoscopy . Patients history abdominal radiation Patients know suspected oropharyngeal esophageal dysphagia ( unless recent EGD show evidence mechanical obstruction esophagus , case esophageal dysphagia ) Patients pacemaker implantable electromedical device Patients highly suspect documented gastroparesis Patients used NSAIDs within previous 2 week Patients anticipate need MRI scan within two week M2A capsule ingestion ( patient require clinically indicate MRI , MRI perform prior administration M2A capsule ) Patients creatinine â‰¥ 2.0 . Patients documented reaction iodinate contrast material . Patients ileostomy colostomy Patients document reaction metoclopramide . Patients hemoglobin less 7.5 g/dl . ( Patients Crohn 's disease often chronically anemic , hemoglobin 7.5 g/dl great would allow patient safely participate study . )</criteria>
