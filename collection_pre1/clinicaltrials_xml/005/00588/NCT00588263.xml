	<brief_summary>The intent propose study describe prevalence common recur mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 , blmAsh , A636P MSH2 mutation among Ashkenazi Jewish individual variety cancer diagnose . If substantial proportion sample contain mutation , future patient present disease may wish undergo genetic counseling , appropriate , formal genetic testing . The benefit process would pertain mainly family individual .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Germline mutation gene BRCA1 BRCA2 demonstrate majority hereditary breast ovarian cancer family . The increase risk develop breast ovarian cancer associate inherit BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation well establish . It also suggest overrepresentation cancer colon , prostate pancreatic cancer present BRCA1 BRCA2 family . Population specific mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 identify . In Ashkenazi Jewish population , 3 specific mutation see 2 % population . This study anonymously screen archive tissue sample Ashkenazi Jewish individual diagnose cancer 1993 1996 MSKCC three founder mutation see Ashkenazi Jewish population . Results stratify tumor type compare population frequency determine whether individual inherit mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 may increase risk develop cancer , addition breast ovarian cancer . This information useful help identify individual may benefit genetic counseling possibly genetic test date typically refer . It also useful develop high-risk cancer screen strategy determine appropriate option prophylactic surgery .</detailed_description>
