	<brief_title>3D Ultrasound Validation Measuring Stomach Volume</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims 1 . To compare fast postprandial volume measure 99mTc- SPECT ( standard test ) 3-D ultrasound 12 healthy adult order test latter 's external validity 2 . To assess performance characteristic 3-D ultrasound measurement gastric volume fast response standard meal , specifically , intra- inter-individual coefficient variation 12 healthy adult undergo two estimation fast postprandial volume 3 . To develop normative data fast postprandial gastric volume 24 asymptomatic adolescent . Study Design The study conduct 2 part : first , 12 healthy adult undergo SPECT 3-D ultrasound random order ( aim 1 ) ; one week first ultrasound examination , second Ultrasound examination conduct participant ( aim 2 ) In second part , 24 adolescent ( 12 gender , 12 age 13-15 , 12 age 16-18 ) ) undergo single determination fast postprandial gastric volume fast post-prandially . The method validation SPECT study previously publish ( 2 ) . Three D ultrasonography conduct use state art equipment follow method publish literature . ( 3 ) The study screen 80 healthy adult adolescent order enroll 12 healthy adulkts first two aim , 24 adolescent healthy subject third aim . For subject group 1 , order SPECT 3D- ultrasound test randomize . The randomization assignment make accord pre-study schedule prepared Section Biostatistics . Medical investigator blind assignment , allocation conceal</detailed_description>
