	<brief_title>Hospital Design Risk Nosocomial Infections : A Prospective Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study underscore importance optimize design standard maximize patient health care worker safety , include prevention hospital acquire infection ( HAI ) patient . Health care associate infection major contributor adverse event healthcare , estimate occur 3-20 % acute care admission Canada . A review role physical environment adverse event identify prospective randomize controlled trial physical plant design impact hospital acquire infection . With construction 2004 unique $ 5-million , 36-bed medical teach unit Foothills Medical Centre ( FMC ) prototypical design feature reduce HAI overarch mandate test new concept health care delivery , opportunity exist rigorously study impact design , construction engineering control ( DCECs ) specific hospital acquire infection antibiotic resistant organism ( ARO ) colonization . In first year operation incidence density hospital acquire infection and/or colonization marker organism decline almost 70 % . Given change type patient , medical , nurse housekeep staff , hypothesize design new ward major factor contribute improved outcome . Given pre-post study design uncertain factor important reduce HAI /colonization rate . We therefore propose conduct prospective , control investigator blind trial impact DCECs specific HAIs ARO colonization . We propose allocate general medical patient , allocation scheme incorporate randomness , one 2 type medical ward FMC , either `` historic design '' ward ( ie control ward non-renovated portion FMC Unit 36 ( experimental new design ward ) . The medical ward similar respect patient mix , acuity care , medical staff , nurse staff skill mix , educational level , housekeeping level knowledge infection control practice differ design . Variables may otherwise confound outcome hospital acquire infections/colonizations may control allow effect difference design , construction engineering control study . The old design ward predominantly 4-bed 2-bed room share bathroom , less space few handwash sinks/patient . The study require 9750 patient day observation `` historic design '' ward 19,500 patient day observation Unit 36 ensure 80 % statistical power detect 60 % difference rate incident case select HAIs ARO colonization ( primary outcome measure ) Î± level 0.05 assume incident case unit follow Poisson distribution base well establish historic trend unit . In addition propose add nest mixed method social science study within construct prospective study understand fit health care worker physical environment . In recognition propose intervention may define `` complex intervention '' HAIs affect many factor related physical plant design , organizational factor , health care worker practice , consider prudent measure describe worker organizational factor medical inpatient care unit include propose intervention . Our propose study do collaboration support Operations Planning &amp; Capital Development portfolio Calgary Health Region . The Region throes major expansion $ 1 billion new capital health care development addition 700 new bed 2010 . The finding favorable outcomes medical ward special design , construction engineer control well design prospective study nature would first kind potential change fundamental design new medical ward Calgary Health Region jurisdiction within Canada .</detailed_description>
