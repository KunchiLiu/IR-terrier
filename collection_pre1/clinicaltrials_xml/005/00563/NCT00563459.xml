	<brief_title>Carisbamate Retention Study ( CaReS ) : Comparative Study Long Term Effectiveness , Safety Tolerability Carisbamate Compared Two Other Frequently Prescribed Anti-epileptic Drugs ( AEDs ) Patients With Epilepsy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following protocol amendment , study resume recruitment April 10 September 4 , 2009 . This randomized , double-blind , parallel-group , active-comparator , multi-center study . The study consist 5 phase : pretreatment ( screen ) , double-blind titration phase , double blind maintenance phase , transition phase , open-label phase . Patients eligible choose enter transition open-label phase study complete exit phase follow double-blind treatment.The primary outcome variable long term retention rate safety adjunctive therapy carisbamate vs. topiramate levetiracetam six month period . This primary endpoint clinically meaningful measure efficacy , safety tolerability time , reflect therapeutic effectiveness antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) . Safety evaluation include adverse event monitoring , blood test , vital sign conduct throughout study.The hypothesis 3 study medication minimum similar treatment retention rate , base distinct efficacy side effect profile , discernible difference rate select adverse event reason treatment discontinuation patient partial onset siezures . Patients must least 1 , 2 , baseline AEDs 30 day prior screen . By end week 8 patient must reach follow minimum dosage study drug permit continue : carisbamate 400 mg/day , topiramate 200 mg/day , levetiracetam 1000 mg/day . Double-blind phase last approximately 12 month . Carisbamate 800 mg/day , topiramate 300 mg/day levetiracetam 2000mg/day administer orally two equally divided dos .</detailed_description>
