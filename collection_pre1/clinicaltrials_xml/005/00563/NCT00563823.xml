	<brief_title>Vatalanib Treating Patients With Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma That Can Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine response rate patient unresectable metastatic cutaneous melanoma treat vatalanib . Secondary - To determine time progression patient . - To determine 6-month 1-year survival patient . - To determine overall survival patient . - To determine safety toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral vatalanib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow 8 week periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
