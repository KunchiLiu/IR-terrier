	<brief_summary>Sepsis sometimes occur people serious infection . It cause toxic substance ( toxin ) bacteria germ enter bloodstream . Most people sepsis recover routine medical care illness get serious . However , people , sepsis become serious . This severe sepsis cause damage internal organ ( heart , lung , kidney , liver ) life threaten . Special natural fat , ( call 'lipoproteins ' ) blood think help protect u toxin produce bacteria sepsis . Levels lipoproteins often low people sepsis may make difficult recover disease . GR270773 new drug develop help lipoprotein protect body toxin . GR270773 make purified fat oil soyabean contain cholesterol . This research study test safety ( side effect ) GR270773 whether effective prevent complication people severe sepsis .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject 18 year age . Subject one follow bacterial infection ( define Section 14.5 ) suspect confirmed Gramnegative etiology : Confirmed Gramnegative bacteremia ( Gramnegative pathogen must isolate blood culture prior study entry ) Intraabdominal infection Nosocomial pneumonia ( Evidence Gramnegative organism histology direct stain respiratory specimen require prior study entry ) Pyelonephritis Subject receive new parenteral antibacterial treatment suspect confirmed Gramnegative infection believe responsible episode sepsis . The subject must receive study drug within 36 hour commence treatment new antibacterial agent . Note : Changes antibiotic coverage make treat infection cause current episode sepsis need treat deteriorate subject previous antibiotic coverage deem inadequate view new antibiotic . Subject sign newonset severe sepsis evidence least ONE follow hypoperfusion abnormality OR organ failure cause current episode sepsis . Subject must receive study medication within 12 hour onset first sepsisrelated hypoperfusion abnormality organ failure : Persistent oliguria ( urine output &lt; 0.5 mL/kg/hr least two hour adequate volume resuscitation ( ie , &gt; =2 L isotonic crystalloid appropriate colloid achieve effect ) ) Note : This criterion apply subject chronic renal insufficiency/failure . Metabolic acidosis ( either pH &lt; =7.3 base deficit &gt; 5 mmol/L blood lactate level &gt; 2X upper limit normal ) Respiratory failure : PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 200 Coagulopathy : acute sepsisrelated change either platelet count ( &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 ) INR ( &gt; 1.5 ) Cardiovascular failure : sustain hypotension require vasopressor support ( dopamine &gt; 5 µg/kg/min , epinephrine , norepinephrine , phenylephrine vasopressin dose use increase blood pressure ) &gt; 1 hour subject volume resuscitation believe adequate ( ie , subject receive &gt; =2 L isotonic crystalloid appropriate colloid achieve effect ) Note : Where hypoperfusion abnormality/organ failure definition require condition persist specify period time , organ failure consider exist condition specify definition met . The 12 hour window start study drug begin criterion organ failure/hypoperfusion fulfil . For organ failure/hypoperfusion abnormality define term laboratory result ( ie , metabolic acidosis , respiratory failure , coagulopathy ) criterion organ failure/hypoperfusion consider fulfilled time laboratory sample drawn . Otherwise , 12 hour window begin time organ failure definition criterion fulfil ( ie , persistent oliguria cardiovascular failure ) . Organ failures occur subsequent subject randomization prior initiation study drug infusion constitute secondary endpoint . These treat organ failure study entry document relevant CRF page . The occurrence subsequent organ failure redefine start 12 hour window start study drug . This period define begin onset first sepsisrelated organ failure qualify subject study entry . Subject legally acceptable representative provide write date informed consent participate study . Subject , female childbearing potential less one year post menopausal ( include practice birth control tubal ligation ) , negative urine pregnancy test ( measure human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) result prior enrollment . Subject currently participate participate investigational drug medical device trial within 30 day five halflives , ever long , prior enrollment study . Subject unlikely remain hospital minimum three day ( 72 hour ) follow enrollment . Subject neutropenia ( e.g. , subject recently receive cytotoxic chemotherapy absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500/µL expect decline &lt; 500/µL next 3 day ) . Subject know believe suffer hereditary spherocytosis S.E . Asian elliptocytosis . Subject know active hemolytic disease ; immune hemolytic anemia , hemoglobinopathy ( sickle cell anemia thalassemia major ) . Subject know bone marrow disorder inadequate red cell production ( eg , aplastic anemia , myelodysplasia ) . Subject increase risk complication GR270773related hemolysis due inability increase cardiac function sufficiently meet demand oxygen delivery . Subject hemoglobin level screen &lt; 9.0 g/dL ( 5.59 mmol/L ) . This hemoglobin assessment base recent available data subject 's medical record time screen use assessment hemoglobin stop rule describe Section 6.2.2 . Subject currently treat Xigris ( Drotrecogin alfa ( activate ) ) use consider imminent ( ie , decision treat Xigris make ) . Subject history allergic reaction egg ( egg product ) , soybean , Intralipid , component GR270773 . Subject designate 'not full support ' , 'do resuscitate ' ( DNR ) , equivalent status prohibits use life support intervention ( e.g. , mechanical ventilation , dialysis/hemofiltration , others ) thereby limit treatment option available . Note : Subjects advance directive prohibit chest compression ( CPR ) eligible study . Subject preexist severe liver disease cirrhosis , primary biliary cirrhosis know preexist ChildPugh class B C liver dysfunction . Subject moribund ( state death perceive imminent ) life expectancy le 3 month due underlying disease . Subject currently receive one follow prohibit concomitant medication ; parenteral nutrition supplement contain lipid emulsion ( eg , Intralipid ) , systemic administration amphotericin preparation ( example ; amphotericin , liposomal amphotericin , amphotericin B lipid complex ) . Note : use topical amphotericin oral amphotericin product permit may administer concomitantly study drug discretion investigator . Subject pregnant ( positive urine pregnancy test baseline ) lactating . Subject previously enrol study .</criteria>
