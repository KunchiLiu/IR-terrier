	<detailed_description>Introduction : Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) dimeric glycoprotein , naturally express epithelial tumor cell ( 1 ) . In condition hypoxia secrete pericytes , Retina Pigmented epithelium ( RPE ) glial cell , include MÃ¼ller cell ( 1,2,4,5 ) favor formation new abnormal vessel ( 1 ) . Its activity mediate two high affinity receptor : receptor VEGF 1 ( FLT-1 ) VEGF 2 ( FLT-2 ) ( 1,9 ) . The FLT-1 promotes cellular proliferation whereas FLT-2 migration cell- extracellular matrix interaction ( 9 ) . The VEGF essential much normal retinal vascularization pathological ( 5,14 ) . Normal Retinal vascularization two phase : In first fase , cell mesenquimatous origin form first superficial plexus ( 14-21 week gestation ) . In second phase , denominate `` angiogenesis phase '' , superficial deep capillary plexus form ( 15,20 ) . The second phase highly dependent VEGF induce hypoxia ( 15,20 ) . In normal retina growth occur optical nerve periphery ( 17 ) . The scientific progress neonatal intensive care unit last year allow survival large number premature newborn ( 15 ) . The Retinopathy Prematurity ( ROP ) ( ROP ) describe first time 1942 ( 4 ) , present moment public health problem develop country . Of 100.000 blind child Latin America , 24.000 due ROP ( 240/1000 blind child ) ( 17 ) . It main cause blindness premature new bear ( 1,4,5 ) . It multifactorial etiology ( 17 ) relate short gestational age ( small 32 week gestation ) ( 4 ) , low birth weight ( le 1500gr ) low birth weight ( le 1250gr ) ( 1,4,5,17,18,20 ) , administration high oxygen concentration immediately birth ( 1,3,18 ) , low level Insulin-like growth factor ( IGF-I ) excessive production VEGF ( 3,17 ) . All , combine large period hyperoxia-hypoxia , Produces normal vascularization retina stop . This also produce vascular-occlusive change , arteriovenous anastomosis edge vascularize none-vascularized retina ( 18 ) , begin formation abnormal vessel towards vitreous , finally lead retina detachment severe case ( 2,3,4,5 ) . The International Classification ROP classify 5 stage , divide 3 anatomical zone . A threshold stage consider presence stage 3 , zone 1 2 5 continuous hour use 8 discontinuous plus disease ( 15,16,17 ) . The pre-threshold stage divide two type : type 1 stage disease zone 1 plus disease , stage 3 , without plus disease zone 1 stage 2 3 plus zone 2 . Type 2 stage 1 2 without plus disease zone 1 stage 3 without plus disease zone 2 ( 17,19 ) . The threshold stage happen approximately 5 % patient low weight birth , 10-15 % develop blindness ( 6,8 ) It public health problem continuous without effective prophylaxis ( 5 ) , nevertheless use constant oxygen concentration , avoid period hyperoxia-hypoxia , demonstrated produce decrease presentation advance stage disease necessity ophthalmological surgery ( 5 ) . The early diagnosis treatment threshold stage change prognosis disease ( 11,12 ) . The use laser treatment threshold prethreshold stage successful 91-95 % case ( 10 ) , ablative effect neuron , probably diminish VEGF production ( 15 ) . The use vitrectomy early case retinal detachment also good result ( 13 ) . For determination quantification VEGF several laboratory technique use , Westernblot ( 1 ) , flow cytometry ( 7 ) , CBA ( 7 ) . Nevertheless , Enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay ( ELISA ) remain gold standard measurement interleukin , growth factor cytokines corporal fluid , include vitreous , Aqueous subretinal fluid ( 1,5,7 ) . It demonstrate human high vitreous concentration VEGF eye active neovascularization ( 6,14 ) . In way , animal model ROP report high level VEGF ( 2,21 ) . The level growth factor alter stage , mark increase first stage ( 2 ) . Some clinical study patient ROP stage 4 5 report increase 90 time great concentration VEGF subretinal liquid comparison find patient retinal detachment cause ( 1 ) . Finally , possible examine retina immediately treatment ( due death patient ) find low expression mRNA VEGF treat cell ( 6 ) . Problem : In spite great amount animal model clinical test human . Until data world-wide Literature report , specific way , VEGF concentration different compartment eye , active stage ROP . Also comparison concentration growth factor find ROP patient , level find well characterized pathology also produce VEGF , Diabetes Mellitus ( DM ) exist</detailed_description>
