	<brief_summary>This randomise , double-blind , double-dummy , multinational , multicentre , parallel group trial compare tiotropium ( 18 mcg ) inhalation capsule via HandiHaler salmeterol ( 50 mcg ) via MDI patient COPD . There two-week run-in period follow 52-week randomised treatment phase . Patients withdraw prematurely trial medication encourage remain trial participate follow-up telephone contact predict normal exit date trial ( i.e . 52 week take first dose randomise treatment ) . The phone call make schedule visit . The primary objective study compare effect tiotropium ( 18 mcg ) inhalation capsule via HandiHaler salmeterol ( 50 mcg ) via MDI COPD exacerbation . The primary endpoint time first COPD exacerbation 52 week randomise treatment period . A COPD exacerbation define complex respiratory event / symptom ( increase new onset ) one following : cough , sputum , wheeze , dyspnoea chest tightness least one symptom last least three day require treatment antibiotic and/or systemic steroid and/or hospitalisation . The onset exacerbation define onset first new increase report symptom . The end exacerbation record defined investigator . Only COPD exacerbation onset randomise treatment include analysis .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . All patient must diagnosis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) must meet follow criterion Visit 1 : Patients must relatively stable , moderate severe airway obstruction postbronchodilator FEV1 &lt; =70 % predict normal FEV1 &lt; =70 % FVC postbronchodilator ( i.e . 30 minute inhalation 4 puff 100 Âµg salbutamol equivalent SABA ) . Predicted normal value calculate accord ECSC . For Height measure inch Males : FEV1 predict ( L ) = 4.30 x ( height ( inch ) / 39.37 ) 0.029 x age ( yr ) 2.49 Females : FEV1 predict ( L ) = 3.95 x ( height ( inch ) / 39.37 ) 0.025 x age ( yr ) 2.60 For Height measure metre Males : FEV1 predict ( L ) = 4.30 x ( height ( metre ) ) 0.029 x age ( year ) 2.49 Females : FEV1 predict ( L ) = 3.95 x ( height ( metre ) ) 0.025 x age ( year ) 2.60 2 .
