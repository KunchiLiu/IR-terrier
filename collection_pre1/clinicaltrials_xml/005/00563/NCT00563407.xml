	<brief_summary>Radiotherapy standard treatment breast cancer lumpectomy . Although treatment show substantial patient benefit decrease local recurrence death breast cancer , also result severe late side-effects , skin fibrosis cardiac failure . It 's possible offer breast irradiation ( RT ) minimize toxicity radiation dose skin , lung heart . This achieve highly conformal RT delivery use Tomotherapy . We plan evaluate approach clinical study . We plan also evaluate value genomic , cellular functional imaging endpoint predictive marker toxicity breast cancer population . This program expect prospectively validate Tomotherapy breast RT decrease skin , lung heart toxicity maintain excellent cancer control lumpectomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Radiotherapy standard treatment conservative surgery early-stage breast cancer . Although approach substantially improve local control reduce death breast cancer , also result severe late side-effects , include skin fibrosis , deaths radiation-induced cardiac disease lung cancer . We undertake novel approach evaluation radiation-induced toxicity whole breast irradiation ( RT ) follow breast-conserving surgery , long-term strategic goal minimize RT toxicity early breast cancer . Theoretically , possible achieve goal highly conformal RT delivery avoidance RT toxicity-prone individual possible . We plan evaluate utility genomic analysis , cellular DNA repair competence , functional imaging endpoint predictive marker toxicity breast cancer population . This program expect ( ) prospectively validate HT breast RT decrease acute toxicity whilst maintain excellent cancer control BCS ; ( b ) demonstrate novel surrogate marker aid prediction acute and/or late normal tissue toxicity view identify toxicity-prone ( conversely , robust ) individual amongst breast cancer population .</detailed_description>
