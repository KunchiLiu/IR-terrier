	<detailed_description>Introduction : The concept retinal photocoagulation introduce Meyer-Schwickerath treatment diabetic retinopathy 50 ( 1 , 6 ) . The first successfully use laser arc xenon laser ( polychromatic , inefficient , hard handle ) . Then ruby argon laser appear ( mayor improvement design management ) . The modern era photocoagulation know begin late 70 . With available technology , focal photocoagulation , panretinal photocoagulation grid photocoagulation develop . Witch prove effective treatment severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy , proliferative diabetic retinopathy different multicenter study ( ETDRS , DRS ) ( 1.6 ) . Patients usually receive 1200 1500 laser shots 2 4 session last 10 20 minute , 2 4 week . The procedure time consuming , tedious painful . Until little change overall design lasers 30 year ago . The difference introduction fibre optic air-based cool system . These innovation impact way treatment success . Early effort improve photocoagulation include complex recognition system eye track try manage fully automate process . That require preview image retina . Attempts also make determine appropriate dose energy get job do . The complexity system prevent clinical use ( 1 ) . The PASCAL system semiautomatic pattern laser , allow much faster processing , accuracy control treatment doctor time . The difference regular laser system PASCAL manage dual frequency Nd : YAG work wavelength 532nm , capable fire single shot 56 shot pre pattern ( 1x1 , 2 x2 , 3x3 , 4x4 , 5x5 ) . By use time exposures 10 20 m , make multiple shot time shot conventional laser do ( 100 m ) . These short pulse allow energy laser focus well tissue , produce less pain , Reduce heat deliver choroid , less diffusion heat subsequent less damage surround tissue ( 1 ) . The first study publish Retina 2006 , Blumenkanz , Palanker , Marcelino , et al . In describe use rabbit 's retina . In compare effect number pulse different duration power . They apply exposition 10 , 20 , 50 100 m . The study find low exposure time require energy 2 3 time produce effect , pulse less energy . As increased exposure time , les power need , pulse also energy . As energy increase shot less homogeneous , less localized change final size ( 110-170micm ) ( 1 ) . ERG : It reflect activity retina `` mass '' . In study effect photocoagulation activity retina , typically use amplitude b wave criterion tissue destruction . But consistency among various study already report variation 10 95 % amplitude ( especially wave b ) due variability length effective ablation retina . Others suggest wave small b , show injury primary layer photoreceptors . Others say decline equal wave . But something conclude response ERG reduce expect base coagulated area . But high , fall ERG expect ( 60 % destruction = 80 % decrease ERG ) . An average photocoagulation destroy 40 % retina approximately ( 5 ) . The destruction peripheral retina decrease ERG response , besides laser affect region adjacent tissue , cause deterioration transmission signal photoreceptors proximal retina . What explain previous report large decrease amplitude basis area coagulate ( 2 ) . The laser energy absorb RPE cell , adjacent layer photoreceptors . What also produce external injury retina also observe increase implicit time ( 3 ) . A year ago change arc xenon argon mark difference amount burn retina decrease implicit time amplitudes wave ( 5 ) . Macular Edema : Is recognize potential adverse effect panretinal photocoagulation . Witch may transitory permanent decrease visual acuity patient . Approximately 60 % photocoagulated patient show increase foveal thickness . Despite fact say change self-distribution blood flow responsible increase thickness , today believe change due post-laser inflammation . Despite performed outside vascular arch ; generally form within . The inflammation factor , addition direct effect exercise intracellular union show capable produce change barrier mediate leukocyte . These factor produce peripheral region photocoagulated area . The laser stimulate production adhesion molecule area around shot non photocoagulated area , produce bearing recruitment leukocyte , secondary accumulation posterior pole subsequent alteration hemato-retinal barrier ( 7 ) .</detailed_description>
