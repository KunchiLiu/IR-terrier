	<brief_summary>It generally understand smoke pregnancy deleterious effect develop fetus , although research smoking pregnancy limit focus , study focus birth weight newborns child 's behavioral disturbance . However , little known neurobiological underpinnings nicotine-related developmental deficit even less known genetic environmental factor may exacerbate risk deficit child . In study , propose examine relation antenatal exposure nicotine infant ' stress-responses birth ( 2-days , 6-months ) moderation family-based stressor gene related nicotine metabolism stress responsivity . We hypothesize risk impose infant antenatal exposure nicotine moderate genotype influence function HPA axis , metabolism nicotine , stress-levels parent influence development neural substrate ( HPA axis ) infant ' capacity cope stress . There grow consensus Gene x Environmental ( G x E ) interplay likely mediate epigenetic effect constitute one central mechanism complex disorder develop . Our proposal offer exceptional paradigm explore association gene , environment , G x E interaction neural behavior response child stressful challenge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Stress Responses Fetuses Infants Whose Mothers Smoked During Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description Proposed Research Design overview . A large cohort pregnant woman recruit , meet criterion divide two group accord testimony regard smoke behavior saliva cotinine screening , previous study . At 3-time point , antenatal period , 2-days 6-months age ; assess infant ' response challenge use biochemical , behavioral , subjective measure . The challenge select `` proven '' stressor previous research demonstrate effectiveness elicit stress-reactions ( e.g. , increased cortisol ) . In parallel , obtain obstetric history ( medical record ) , demographic , measure symptomology , information smoking drinking habit , life stress , family cohesion time point , plus information mother ' feelings/behavior mother ' rating infant `` regulatory '' behavior birth . The antenatal neonatal session carry Hadassah Hospital 6-month session developmental laboratory Hebrew University . Genetic material collect parent infant childbirth . Recruitment Women smoker recruit recruited nurse well-baby clinic ( physician routine prenatal check-ups ) , gynecologist , midwife , advertisement . In addition , recruit woman time routine check Hadassah hospital ( Nuchal translucency test ) 12 week , triple/quadra test blood test 16 week , early ( 14-16 week ) advance ( 20-22 week ) fetal anatomy scan , glucose test 24-28 week ) ( supervise Dr. Mankuta ) . In , recruit 150 woman `` smoke '' group , use follow inclusion criterion : smoke least 10 cigarette day ( i.e. , habitual smoker ) abuse alcohol drug , chronic physical disability , 22-35 year age , live partner , speak English , Hebrew , Russian , natural conception ) . A ( second ) group 150 woman meet inclusion criterion ( except smoke ) match age , education , gender infant , parity `` smoker '' serve control . At recruitment time-point , mother ( spouse ) agree participate research protocol interview smoke habit ( Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire , FTQ ) detail previous study smoke . At recruitment , woman explicitly tell encouraging smoking provide resource , time , study , want stop smoking . Antenatal period ( Dr. David Mankuta ) The prenatal session carry 34-36 week gestation ( last menstrual period confirm early ultrasound ) consist 3 phase : ( 1 ) wait room- mother receive instruction , ( 2 ) ultrasound- evaluate limb movement vibroacoustic stimulation ( VAS ) , well measure fetus ' well-being ( cardiotocograph test , biophysical profile ) , ( 3 ) post exam- administration questionnaire . Limb movement . Measures fetal limb movement good reflection infant state , stable late gestation 4-weeks postnatal age 80 , affect antenatal stress 81 , forecast infant ' state regulation 2 week birth . Ultrasound ( ATL 3500 5000 ) use visualize film fetus offline cod limb movement . To begin test , infant must state 1F , characterize minimal fetal movement 2 minute . When criterion meet , baseline VAS ( Fetal Acoustic Corometrics Stimulator Model 146 ; ≈75 HZ , ≈82 db ) present 5 s. Fetal movement videotape recorder build scanner . During off-line time-event coding , limb movement count . From raw count , average number movement observe 10 interval 1 min prior ( baseline ) 5 min stimulation . Reactivity derive calculate difference mean baseline count mean count record 5 stimulation . Regulation calculate ( 1 ) slope count across post stimulation period ( 5 minute ) , ( 2 ) difference mean baseline count mean count last three 10 second epoch . first time point . Previous study show limb-counts stable ( 24-36 week ) , reliable , sensitive maternal stress . Questionnaires</detailed_description>
