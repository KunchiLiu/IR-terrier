	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find erlotinib give chemotherapy radiation therapy help control Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) . The safety combination treatment also study . Researchers also test tissue earlier biopsy measure level epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . The purpose EGFR test learn link various form EGFR response treatment erlotinib . Primary Objective : Determine feasibility concurrent erlotinib chemoradiation measure safety compliance . Safety measure rate grade 3 bad nonhematological toxicity occur prior begin consolidation therapy ( include toxicity attribute chemoradiation occur within 90 day start radiation therapy ) ; compliance define completion treatment regimen minor variation . Secondary Objectives : 1 . Investigate association EGFR expression toxicity , response , overall survival , progression 2 . Estimate overall survival patient study regimen ( one two year rate , median survival ) . 3 . Estimate time disease progression patient study regimen ( one two year rate ) 4 . Estimate treatment response rate patient study regimen ( complete partial response rate )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TARCEVA ( Erlotinib ) Combination With Chemoradiation Patients With Stage IIIA/B Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Erlotinib design block activity protein call epidermal growth factor ( EGFR ) . EGFR find surface many tumor cell may control tumor growth survival . This may stop tumor grow . If find eligible take part study , take erlotinib every day 7 week ( except day receive chemotherapy ) . The erlotinib tablet take time day , least 1 hour 2 hour meal , small glass ( 7 ounce ) water . If unable swallow tablet , may dissolve tablet distilled water drink . You receive radiation every day ( Monday Friday ) 7 week . You also receive chemotherapy needle vein week 7 week . The chemotherapy include carboplatin paclitaxel . Receiving chemotherapy take 6 hour total . You receive consolidation therapy week 11-17 . Treatment study last 17 week . Once week time , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . You also CT scan chest within 4 week begin study , 2 month finish therapy , every 6 month 2 year . The CT scan use check status disease . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . In case , would receive erlotinib anymore would continue standard chemotherapy radiation therapy . You ask come clinic follow-up visit check recovery treatment . The follow-up visit end treatment , 1 month treatment , month long doctor feel necessary . Once side effect become less severe , ask come clinic follow-up visit every 3 month 2 year , every 4 month follow 2 year . You physical exam , medical history record . You ask side effect may . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . You PET scan . You right leave study time . If choose stop participating study , contact study chair and/or research nurse . Your doctor may decide take study medical condition get bad and/or unable comply study requirement . At end study automatically notify research finding . If wish learn result , however , may request study chair . This investigational study . All three study drug commercially available . Carboplatin , paclitaxel FDA approve treatment NSCLC , use combination erlotinib . Erlotinib FDA approve us , approve FDA treat lung cancer patient like yet undergone chemotherapy ; however , FDA permit use research study . Carboplatin paclitaxel consider standard care treatment would probably treat drug similar drug even decide study . Up 48 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
