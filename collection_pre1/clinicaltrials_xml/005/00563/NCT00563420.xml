	<brief_summary>Lung cancer commonest malignant disease 5-year survival 14 % . In Hong Kong , account 30 % cancer death . The poor prognosis lung cancer due largely late clinical presentation disease . In order improve prognosis lung cancer , obvious approach develop sensitive method detect lung cancer much earlier stage treatment likely curative . However , best way identify early lung cancer still need determine . We hypothesis examine specimen contain shed bronchial epithelial cell i.e . sputum , lung cancer sample early possible phase . And use autofluorescence bronchoscopy , system specifically design detect early lung cancer/pre-invasive lesion , identify source abnormal cell , may able detect eraly lung cancer follow curative treatment improve prognosis disease .</brief_summary>
