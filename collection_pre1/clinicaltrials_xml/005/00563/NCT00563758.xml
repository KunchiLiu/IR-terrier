	<brief_summary>Idiopathic functional constipation common disorder , affect 20 % population depend demographic factor , sample situation definition use . Constipation symptom many disease collective term , use patient imply stool hard , infrequent difficult pas . A recent survey conduct Hong Kong show prevalence 14 % accord Rome criterion . Based epidemiological study US , 2.5 million annual physician visit problem . Exact epidemiological data however lack , mainly difference self-reported constipation scientifically define constipation . Treatment constipation usually base increased dietary fiber supplementation bulk agent , exercise , habit training . However , often partial relief obtain , majority patient use non-bulking laxative regular basis without medical supervision . Chronic use non-bulking laxative often inappropriate3 , may lead side effect dependency progressive tolerance , electrolyte imbalance , , anthraquinones , melanosis coli . In addition , stimulant laxative may damage myenteric plexus4 , result cathartic colon5 . A appropriate approach therapy constipation consist physiologically stimulating intestinal motility . Tegaserod , aminoguanidine indole compound , representative new class 5-HT4 agonist , regard chemistry pharmacology . Activation 5-HT4 receptor trigger release neurotransmitter enteric nerve result increased contractility stimulation peristaltic reflex . In animal model , tegaserod act motility-enhancing agent , exert activity throughout gastrointestinal tract11 . Tegaserod also show significantly accelerate bowel transit healthy volunteer patient constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome ( C-IBS ) . Based pharmacodynamic property , tegaserod promotile compound suitable treatment associate small and/or large bowel dysfunction e.g . constipation . From phase III adequate well-controlled study patient C-IBS show tegaserod effective relieving symptom C-IBS . The effect see early first week treatment sustain effect 12 week . Both tegaserod 4 mg/d ( 2 mg bid ) 12 mg/d ( 6 mg bid ) significantly increase bowel frequency decrease stool consistency . It propose test dos phase III program chronic constipation . The aim study demonstrate effect tegaserod bowel habit patient suffer chronic idiopathic constipation .</brief_summary>

Constipation define follow : less three spontaneous bowel movement per week result feel complete evacuation , one following : At least 25 % stools hard and/or hard stool ( Type 1 and/or 2 Bristol Stool Form scale ) 14 , Sensation incomplete evacuation follow least 25 % bowel movement Straining least 25 % defecation The criterion applicable spontaneous bowel movement , i.e . precede within period 24 hour intake laxative agent use enema . Patients never spontaneous bowel movement ( , bowel movement precede laxative ) consider constipate eligible study . Patients able communicate well investigator comply requirement entire study , include withdrawal period . Patients provide write informed consent participate study give full description study . Exclusion Criteria entry study ( Performed screen ) : Patients meet one follow criterion include study Use herbs 2 week study Planned use disallow medication . With evidence cathartic colon history laxative abuse With history fecal impaction necessitate surgical intervention Whose chronic constipation , accord investigator 's clinical judgment , think result : bowel surgery , gynecological surgery , neurologic disorder ( e.g . aganglionosis , hypoganglionosis , autonomic neuropathy , Parkinson 's disease , spinal cord injury tumor , cerebrovascular accident , multiple sclerosis ) , systemic sclerosis , myloidosis , scleroderma , myotonic dystrophy With diagnosis megarectum colon , intestinal pseudoobstruction , mechanical outlet obstruction , congenital anorectal malformation , rectocele , intestinal carcinoma , inlammatory bowel disease . An endoscopic/radiologic bowel evaluation ( colonoscopic examination and/or sigmoidoscopy + barium enema ) require order rule cancer , inflammatory bowel disease structural disease . This evaluation must perform within past 5 year . In addition , history evidence weight loss , anemia rectal bleeding since evaluation perform . Existence surgical medical condition interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion study medication . With hypo hyper thyroidism ( clinically significant abnormal TSH level screen ) With clinical evidence ( include physical exam , vital sign , ECG , laboratory test ) significant cardiovascular , respiratory , renal , hepatic , gastrointestinal , hematology , endocrine metabolic disorder , neurologic disease , disease may interfere patient successfully complete study . Patient insulindependent diabetes exclude study . With psychosis , schizophrenia , mania major psychiatric illness need pharmacological treatment . A wellcompensated depression exclude potential patient . With symptom significant clinical illness two week precede baseline . With relevant intercurrent medical condition may interfere objective study . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Fertile woman currently use comply medically approve method contraception , exclusively , one following : Oral birth control pill administer least 1 full monthly cycle prior study medication administration , Progesterone implant rod insert least 1 month prior study medication administration , Intrauterine device ( IUD ) , Medroxyprogesterone acetate administer minimum 1 month prior study medication administration continue 1 month follow last dose study medication , Double barrier method ( condom spermicide ) , Abstinence , opinion investigator , occupation life style give sufficient evidence abstinence maintain throughout study 1 month thereafter . In case abstinence , record source document patient appropriately counsel . Fertile woman define woman surgically sterile ( i.e . hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy bilateral tubal ligation ) , postmenopausal ( postmenopausal patient define patient menstruate 12 month ) . With evidence history drug alcohol abuse within past 12 month . Who receive another investigational drug within 30 day prior entry study . Who participate prior tegaserod study . Exclusion criterion randomization ( Performed Day 1 ) : Patients exclude entry doubleblind period study : Whose constipation , define Inclusion Criteria No . 2 , confirm diary data baseline period ( average last two week baseline ) . With loose watery stool ( Type 6 7 stool form accord Bristol stool form scale ) occur 3 day baseline period . In exclusion criterion , list baseline period , identify prior start treatment period . Who comply complete daily diary assessment . To randomize , patient must least 11 day complete daily diary data last 14 day baseline period . Who comply complete weekly diary assessment . To randomize , patient must complete least 1 complete weekly diary assessment last 14 day baseline period . Who deviate guideline regard prohibited medication ( see section 3.4.4 ) two day ( 3 day ) baseline .</criteria>
