	<brief_title>Dasatinib Treating Patients With Unresectable Metastatic Squamous Cell Skin Cancer RAI Stage 0-I Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate ( complete response partial response ) patient unresectable metastatic squamous cell carcinoma skin RAI stage 0-I chronic lymphocytic leukemia receive dasatinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression-free survival patient receive drug . II . Evaluate tumor presence total EphA2 total active Src FAK immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) pre-treatment dasatinib . III . Evaluate tumor presence cyclooxygenase-2 IHC pre-treatment dasatinib . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive 100 mg dasatinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . ARM II ( PATIENTS ENROLLED AFTER 11/18/08 ) : Patients receive 70 mg dasatinib PO BID day 1-28 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Pre-therapy tumor biopsy specimen collect detect total phosphorylated Src FAK , total EphA2 , cyclooxygenase-2 immunohistochemistry . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 12 week .</detailed_description>
