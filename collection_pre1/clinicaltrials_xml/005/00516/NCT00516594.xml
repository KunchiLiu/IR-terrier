At visit , body weight ( kg ) obtain indoor clothing , without shoe , blood pressure take twice dominant arm subject seat least 20 minute . Height ( cm ) record first visit . Throughout study period , subject maintain usual diet , NCEP step 2 diet ( low saturate fat ) . Subjects provide fast blood sample week 0 weekly period throughout study . At week 0 , 4 seven-day food record collect . Subjects also weigh seat blood pressure take . Breath sample , 24h urine 4-day fecal collection make begin study end study phase . Diets : Initial dietary record prior start study together instruction dietitian ensure subject low fat ( &lt; 7 % energy saturate fat ) , low cholesterol diet ( &lt; 200 mg/d ) , maintain throughout study .
