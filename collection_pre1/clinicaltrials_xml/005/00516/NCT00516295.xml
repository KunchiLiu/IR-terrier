	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study 6-patient feasibility portion study tolerability chemotherapy vincristine sulfate together topotecan hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , bevacizumab treat young patient refractory first recurrent extracranial Ewing 's sarcoma . If therapy consider tolerable , feasibility run-in follow randomized phase II portion study give vincristine sulfate together topotecan hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide see well work compare give vincristine sulfate together topotecan hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , bevacizumab treat young patient refractory first recurrent extracranial Ewing 's sarcoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , vincristine sulfate , topotecan hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop tumor growth block blood flow tumor . Giving combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility administer bevacizumab combination vincristine ( vincristine sulfate ) , topotecan hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide ( VTC ) young patient refractory first recurrent Ewing sarcoma . II . To compare progression-free survival patient treat VTC bevacizumab v VTC without bevacizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate response rate 2 cycle VTC compare 2 cycle VTC/bevacizumab . II . To evaluate biological marker related prognosis specifically related angiogenesis encourage concurrent enrollment Ewing sarcoma banking study ( COG-AEWS02B1 and/or COG-AEWS07B1 ) ancillary correlative endothelial cell , surrogate marker , angiogenic gene study . OUTLINE : This single therapy feasibility study follow randomize control portion . Patients stratify accord time disease recurrence ( &lt; 2 year vs &gt; = 2 year ) . ARM I ( Feasibility assessment VTCB ) : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 , vincristine sulfate IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , topotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute cyclophosphamide IV 60 minute day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day ( except week 14 , 15 [ course 5 ] , 17 , 18 [ course 6 ] , 26 , 27 [ course 9 ] , 29 , 30 [ course 10 ] chemotherapy give ) 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II ( VTCB ) : Patients receive bevacizumab , vincristine sulfate , topotecan hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide Arm I . ARM III ( VTC ) : Patients receive vincristine sulfate , topotecan hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide arm I . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
