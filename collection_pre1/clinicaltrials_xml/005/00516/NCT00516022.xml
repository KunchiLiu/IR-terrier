	<brief_summary>Mistletoe extract one common complementary treatment use Europe . Recent basic study report tumor response survival prolongation number treatment Mistletoe preparation . There evidence base data use drug side effect reducer use combination chemotherapy regimen treatment . Other clinical data , although well base complementary treatment use combination common oncology treatment tumor response effect . Combinations platinum compound third generation cytotoxic agent accept 'standard care ' patient advance NSCLC . The combination platinum compound one new agent associate response rate 30-40 % median survival 8-11 month advance NSCLC patient good performance status . Study objective : Improvement QOL , Improvement toxicity profile chemotherapy treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mistletoe Complementary Treatment Patients With Advanced Non-small-cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) , Treated With Carboplatin/Gemcitabine Chemotherapy Combination .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design include 90 subject . All subject treat common chemotherapy treatment . 50 percent treat Iscador combination common chemotherapy regimen . Common chemotherapy regimen use NSCLC : Carboplatin Gemcitabine . All study participant receive chemotherapy regimen . This chemotherapy treatment give every 3 week 6 treatment cycle . The first day first treatment cycle , combination Carboplatin Gemcitabine administer . After week ( day 8 treatment cycle ) Gemcitabine administer . Drugs would calculate accord patient 's body mass , renal function general appearance . Once patient sign Informed Consent assign randomly treat with/without injection Mistletoe ( call `` Iscador '' ) . Patient receive study medication ( Iscador ) intravenous injection self inject injected family . Injections would administer low dose first week first treatment cycle , dose would escalate , check high sensitivity drug . Dosage would include : 2 injection 0.1 mg , 2 injection 0.1 mg 2 injection 1 mg. After , treatment would continue dosage 10 g every 2 day . Patients treatment arm would ask fill-out QOL questionnaires every treatment cycle follow-up visit . Study Primary Objectives : 1 . Improvement QOL 2 . Improvement toxicity profile chemotherapy treatment Secondary Objectives : 1 . Improvement time tumor progression ( TTP ) survival . 2 . Safety profile mistletoe extract combination chemotherapy treatment This single center study , randomize phase II , patient advance NSCLC treat carboplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy combination .</detailed_description>
