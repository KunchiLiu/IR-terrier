	<brief_title>Safety Study Subjects With Leber Congenital Amaurosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Leber Congenital Amaurosis ( LCA ) severe early onset retinal degeneration . Diagnosis usually make first month life infant present severely impaired vision , abnormal eye movement ( nystagmus ) abnormal electroretinogram ( ERG ) indicate decrease retinal function . There inevitable progression total blindness individual due death photoreceptor cell . There presently treatment disease . The primary objective study determine safety tolerability subretinal administration AAV2-hRPE65v2 subject Leber congenital amaurosis due RPE65 mutation . The secondary objective ass objective clinical measure efficacy human subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female subject ethnic group eligible participation study , provide meet follow criterion : 1 . Must willing adhere protocol companion protocol longterm followup evidence write informed consent parental permission subject assent . 2 . Adults child diagnose LCA . 3 . Molecular diagnosis LCA due RPE65 mutation ( homozygote compound heterozygote ) CLIAapproved laboratory . 4 . Age eight year old old time administration . 5 . Visual acuity â‰¤ 20/160 visual field le 20 degree eye inject . SUBJECTS WILL NOT BE EXCLUDED BASED ON THEIR GENDER , RACE OR ETHNICITY . Subjects meet following condition exclude clinical study : 1 . Unable unwilling meet requirement study . 2 . Participation clinical study investigational drug past six month . 3 . Preexisting eye condition would preclude plan surgery interfere interpretation study endpoint ( example , glaucoma , corneal lenticular opacity ) . 4 . Lack sufficient viable retinal cell determine noninvasive mean , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) and/or ophthalmoscopy . Specifically , indirect ophthalmoscopy reveals less 1 disc area retina involve complete retinal degeneration ( indicated geographic atrophy , thin tapetal sheen , confluent intraretinal pigment migration ) , eyes exclude . In addition , eye optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) scan sufficient quality obtain , area retina thickness measurement less 100 um , absence neural retina , target delivery AAV2hRPE65v2 . 5 . Complicating systemic disease clinically significant abnormal baseline laboratory value . Complicating systemic disease would include disease , treatment disease , alter ocular function . Examples malignancy whose treatment could affect central nervous system function ( example , radiation treatment orbit ; leukemia CNS/optic nerve involvement ) . Also exclude would subject immunocompromising disease , could susceptibility opportunistic infection ( CMV retinitis ) . Subjects diabetes sickle cell disease would exclude manifestation advance retinopathy ( e.g . macular edema proliferative change ) . Subjects juvenile rheumatoid arthritis could exclude due increase infection risk surgery due poor wound heal . Subjects positive hepatitis B , C , HIV exclude . 6 . Prior ocular surgery within six month . 7 . Known sensitivity medication plan use perioperative period . 8 . Individuals childbearing potential pregnant unwilling use effective contraception duration study . 9 . Any condition would allow potential subject complete followup examination course study , opinion investigator , make potential subject unsuitable study . 10 . Subjects exclude immunological study show presence neutralizing antibody AAV2 1:1000 .</criteria>
