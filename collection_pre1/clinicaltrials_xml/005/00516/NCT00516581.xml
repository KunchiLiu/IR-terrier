	<detailed_description>From begin AIDS epidemic , pneumocystis pneumonia ( PCP ) distinguish one frequent opportunistic disease high morbid-mortality . As 1996 , advent highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) change characteristic epidemic reduce related disease , result , AIDS-related mortality . With purpose estimate PCP occurrence HAART interference , 376 HIV-infected AIDS patient study January 1992 December 2002 . Among , 58 ( 15.5 % ) PCP case find . There high occurrence PCP group patient HAART use , 40 ( 69.0 % ) episodes . As regard studied period , tendency linear reduction annual PCP incidence observe . The mean T CD4+ lymphocytes patient PCP ( 117 cells/mm3 ) significantly low compare individual ( 325 cells/mm3 ) . Therefore , study suggest temporal reduction PCP occurrence relate HAART use high T CD4+ lymphocyte count . Nevertheless , opportunistic infection still show significant incidence AIDS patient .</detailed_description>
