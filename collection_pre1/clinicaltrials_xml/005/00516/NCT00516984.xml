	<brief_title>Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment Its Relationship Autonomic Nervous System Activity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For osteopathic physician validation osteopathic manipulative treatment ( OMT ) largely observational base patient outcome improvement pain scale , range motion , empiric measures.1,2 However , osteopathic profession long recognize relationship autonomic nervous system function body health disease , although relatively little quantitative data evaluate relationship manipulation autonomic nervous system.3,4 A theoretical basis action OMT effect body advance base autonomic activation cause concomitant vasodilatation , smooth muscle relaxation , increase blood flow , result improved range motion , decrease pain perception , change tissue . Until recently association remain largely theoretical consideration due inability accurately measure autonomic activity directly . Over past two decade indirect method develop refine provide noninvasive marker autonomic balance,5,6 heart rate variability ( HRV ) commonly use . HRV base inherent variation R-to-R interval standard electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , variation largely due change autonomic balance sinus node.6-8 Spectral analysis heart rate variability use study autonomic balance human , generally accept high frequency ( HF ) component ( 0.15-0.4 Hz ) use marker vagal modulation heart rate . Although tempt use low frequency ( LF ) component ( 0.04-0.15 Hz ) marker sympathetic activity , specificity less clear . Pagani colleagues9,10 hypothesize LF component express normalized unit ( LFnu ) become good marker sympathetic modulation heart rate . For study use spectral analysis , LF/HF ratio use consider many good index sympathovagal balance.6,7,9,10 The confidence give LF/HF ratio accurately reflect autonomic balance significantly influence experimental design . A tilt protocol involve postural change horizontal upright use calibrate change LF/HF ratio occur two position thus set physiological range sympathetic vagal modulation heart rate . An experimental procedure implement comparison make change LF/HF ratio occur body shift horizontal upright position condition application intervention versus without intervention . In manner , experimentally mediate change LF/HF ratio ( i.e. , intervention ) calibrate physiologically relevant change ratio ( i.e. , without intervention ) . This approach use investigator pilot study ( n=9 healthy , adult volunteer , 3 female 6 male ) show LF/HF ratio change mean 1.75+1.40 ( mean+SD ) horizontal position mean 6.00+1.20 50-degree head-up position . This change reflect increase sympathetic tone . Mean heart rate subject increase 61+7 bpm 78+2 bpm head-up position . The subject treat 50-degree head-up position OMT procedure , cervical myofascial release , thought increase vagal tone . After procedure apply , LF/HF ratio decrease back 1.75+1.58 , even though subject still head-up position . These data support initial hypothesis specific OMT procedure modulate vagal tone , also provide information relate significance LF/HF change . That , application OMT reverse increase ratio occur 50-degree head-up position . We conduct continuation project examine association OMT autonomic nervous system activity demonstrate HRV , study hypothesis cervical myofascial release increase vagal tone . In within subject ( repeat measure ) design , examined effect OMT HRV comparison sham treatment ( touch ) control ( touch ) condition .</detailed_description>
