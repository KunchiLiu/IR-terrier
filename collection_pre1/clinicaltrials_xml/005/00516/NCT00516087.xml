	<brief_summary>Patients type cancer call nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) either come back , go away high risk come back best treatment know disease . We invite patient participate research study use new experimental therapy consist special immune system cell call LMP1- LMP2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( LMP1- LMP2-CTLs ) . Some patient nasopharyngeal carcinoma show evidence infection virus cause infectious mononucleosis Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) time diagnosis . EBV find cancer cell almost patient advanced stage NPC , suggest may play role cause disease . The cancer cell infect EBV able hide body 's immune system escape destruction . We want see special white blood cell , call T cell , train recognize kill special part EBV infect cell survive blood affect tumor . We use sort therapy treat different type cancer occur bone marrow solid organ transplant call post-transplant lymphoma . In type cancer tumor cell 9 protein make EBV surface . We grow T cell laboratory recognize 9 protein able prevent treat post-transplant lymphoma . However nasopharyngeal carcinoma tumor cell express 2 EBV protein ( LMP1 LMP2 ) surface . In previous study make T cell recognize 9 protein give patient NPC . While patient response , patient cancer completely go away . We try find improve treatment grow give T cell cell recognize two protein express NPC cell call LMP1 LMP2 . These special T cell call LMP1- LMP2-CTLs . These LMP1- LMP2-CTLs investigational product approve Food Drug Administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LMP1- LMP2-Specific CTLs Patients With EBV-Positive NPC ( NATELLA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients EBV-positive cancer . We get permission take blood patient past , use grow T cell laboratory . We first grow special type cell call dendritic cell stimulate T cell . We put specially produce human virus ( adenovirus ) carry LMP1 LMP2 gene dendritic cell . These dendritic cell treat radiation could grow . They use stimulate T cell . This stimulation train T cell kill cell LMP1 LMP2 surface . We grow LMP1- LMP2-specific CTLs stimulation EBV infect cell ( make blood infect EBV laboratory treat radiation would grow ) . We also put adenovirus carry LMP1 LMP2 gene EBV infect cell increase amount LMP1 LMP2 cell . Once make sufficient number T cell test make sure kill cell LMP1 LMP2 surface . These cell ready give patient agree participate study . If patient agree treatment get treat two dos LMP1-and LMP2-specific CTLs , dose give 2 week apart . If patient female child-bearing potential , give pregnancy test within one week prior infusion . If patient pregnant , able participate study . The study doctor notify . The CTLs thaw injected central line , one , vein arm 1 10 minute . They may receive dose Tylenol Benadryl beforehand . We monitor patient clinic 1 4 hour injection . All treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Texas Children 's Hospital Houston Methodist Hospital . We follow patient clinic CTL injection also follow result disease evaluation primary doctor . To learn way T cell work long last body , extra 10-60 ml ( 2-12 teaspoonful ) blood take . We use blood look immune response blood cancer . To learn injected T cell anti-tumor activity , measure size patient 's tumor T-cell infusion 8 week afterwards routine image study CT ( computer tomogram ) , MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) , PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) . If patient stable disease reduction size tumor image study T-cell infusion , patient receive six additional dos T cell 6 12 week interval wish .</detailed_description>
