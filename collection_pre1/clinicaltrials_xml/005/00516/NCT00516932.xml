	<detailed_description>Pharmacogenomics Antidepressant Response Children Adolescents ( PARCA ) sub-study Antidepressant Safety Kids ( ASK ) study . PARCA ASK part Child Adolescent Psychiatry Trials Network ( CAPTN ) . Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( SNRI ) medication prescribe approximately 2 3 % American child . Evidence suggest medication beneficial treat obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , anxiety disorder , major depressive disorder . Following hearing February September 2004 , FDA mandate Black Box warn antidepressant , caution prescribers risk treatment-emergent suicidal tendency child adolescent treat drug . Although prescribe wan somewhat follow warn , many child continue receive SSRIs SNRIs variety condition empirically validate alternative treatment . Therefore , press need clearly understand safety , tolerability , effectiveness SSRIs SNRIs child adolescent . This study identify variation differentially express gene may involve development suicidal event certain behavior youth expose antidepressant medication . Specific aim study include following : 1 . To establish genetic susceptibility database create DNA repository 120 patient prospectively identify `` Suicidal Event '' 360 closely matched antidepressant-tolerant control , include rigorous phenotypic characterization patient ; 2 . To establish genetic susceptibility database create DNA repository 120 patient prospectively identify `` Behavioral Activation '' 360 closely matched antidepressant-tolerant control , include rigorous phenotypic characterization patient ; 3 . To establish genetic susceptibility database create DNA repository 120 patient prospectively identify co-occurring `` Suicidal Event Behavioral Activation '' 360 closely matched antidepressant-tolerant control , include rigorous phenotypic characterization patient ; 4 . To identify genetic polymorphism responsible development `` Suicidal Events '' use candidate gene approach , include biosynthetic pathway , metabolize enzyme , transporter , ion channel , receptor ; 5 . To identify genetic polymorphism responsible development `` Behavioral Activation '' use candidate gene approach , include biosynthetic pathway , metabolize enzyme , transporter , ion channel , receptor ; 6 . To use data along data parent study , ASK , good understand relationship `` Suicidal Events '' `` Behavioral Activation . '' Participants include participant ASK study want participate PARCA study . Participants use self-collection kit provide saliva sample . The saliva sample mail study center DNA analysis . There study visit .</detailed_description>
