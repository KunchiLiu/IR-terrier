	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , galiximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well galiximab work treat patient relapsed refractory Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Galiximab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine response rate ( complete overall response ) patient relapse refractory Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) treat galiximab . Secondary - To assess duration response , progression-free survival , overall survival patient relapse refractory HL . - To assess safety tolerability galiximab patient relapse refractory HL . - To determine FDG-PET correlate outcome patient relapse refractory HL treat galiximab . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Induction therapy : Patients receive galiximab IV 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 month 1 . - Extended induction therapy : Patients receive galiximab IV 60 minute every four week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also undergo FDG-PET/CT image baseline time first restaging ( within 7 day prior week 8 treatment ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 10 year .</detailed_description>
