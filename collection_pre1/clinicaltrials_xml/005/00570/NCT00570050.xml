	<brief_summary>The primary aim study determine whether adjunctive intranasal insulin exert antidepressant effect compare placebo adult major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , insufficiently responsive conventional antidepressant . There three secondary aim study ( 1 ) determine whether adjunctive intranasal insulin alter emotional processing ( i.e. , cognitive-affective interface ) ; ( 2 ) determine whether early change emotional processing ( i.e. , single dose 40IU intranasal insulin ) predict symptomatic improvement study endpoint ; ( 3 ) determine effect intranasal insulin neurocognitive performance ( e.g. , learn memory ) . This initiative represent proof-of-concept study insulin important depressive symptom , neurocognitive functioning , emotional processing deficit MDD , represent novel safe therapeutic avenue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Emerging evidence impairment cognitive-affective interface , frequently define affective cognition , increasingly recognize core feature mood disorder , particularly MDD . Individuals MDD consistently exhibit abnormality verbal memory particular difficulty memory task list learn free recall . The administration intranasal insulin report improve verbal memory , declarative memory individual Alzheimer 's disease Mild Cognitive Impairment well measure mood ( e.g. , overall feeling well-being , self-esteem , depression ) healthy volunteer . The effect intranasal insulin measure neurocognitive function emotional processing MDD currently unknown . Thirty participant age 18 60 DSM-IV-TR define MDD [ confirm Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) ] enrol . Individuals age 18 60 exclude see recruit center . Enrollment study voluntary . Eligible participant provide write informed consent . Participants enrol outpatient Mood Disorders Psychopharmacology Unit ( MDPU ) , University Health Network ( UHN ) , University Toronto . The MDPU case report form gather information participant 's course illness variable . Conventional pharmacological treatment MDD permit ( e.g. , conventional antidepressant ) . Conventional unimodal antidepressant modulate cerebral glucose metabolism ; , keep consistent throughout duration study alter point randomization study endpoint . Antidepressants augmentation strategy significant anti-cholinergic potential ( e.g. , paroxetine , tricyclic antidepressant ) well benzodiazepine exclusionary may negatively affect neurocognitive function . Participants exclude receive corticosteroid antihypertensive medication ; misuse substance alcohol past 3 month ; receive electroconvulsive therapy last 1 year ; neurological medically unstable condition . Another exclusion criterion include inability provide write informed consent . The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-Item ( HAM-D-17 ) administer baseline weekly throughout 8 week treatment assignment . Participants actively suicidal evaluate suicide risk also exclude . Other reason discontinuation impair fast glucose ( i.e. , 6.1 - 6.9 mmol/L ) , non-compliance ( i.e. , failure administer â‰¥ 80 % assign treatment week ) . The ongoing provision care contingent enrollment and/or completion study protocol . Furthermore , ongoing communication participant 's primary care provider regard participation study . This randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over study . The initial visit entail provision detail study information patient obtainment write informed consent participant . The participant meet research team member later date screen visit . This study require total 12 visit . Full neuropsychological testing conduct 4 time point : 1 . Baseline1 ( Visit 3 ) 2 . Endpoint1 ( Visit 7 ) 3 . Baseline2 ( Visit 8 ) 4 . Endpoint2 ( Visit 12 )</detailed_description>
