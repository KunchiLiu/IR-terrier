A large body evidence implicate psychosocial stress risk factor trigger reduce blood flow heart , heart attack sudden cardiac death , yet specific mechanism relationship remain investigation . The nervous system , play role regulation heart , influence cardiac arrhythmia ( irregular heart beat ) . There several study suggest acupuncture improve anginal symptom ( like chest pain tightness ) blood pressure , reduce stress improve overall quality life . The reason acupuncture seem positive effect factor think helps artery nervous system work well . It possible measure effect systematic way . The functioning artery measure Peripheral Arterial Tonometry , ( PAT ) simple monitoring device measure blood flow use finger probe blood pressure cuff . Changes nervous system measure use 24-hour Holter monitor record heart rate . The 24-hour Holter monitor also show oxygen flow heart decrease , would happen stress , record continuous electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Feelings stress establish questionnaire . The purpose study compare three group people know coronary heart disease . One group receive traditional acupuncture , one group receive alternative acupuncture , third group receive usual care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A . SPECIFIC AIMS Sudden unexpected cardiac death remain significant problem patient establish coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , account 30 % death group ( ~150,000 death annually ) despite recognition treatment disease . These sudden death due myocardial infarction ischemic nonischemically mediate arrythmias . Traditional risk factor completely account excess CHD death . Although treatment cardiac risk factor , hyperlipidemia , show significantly reduce cardiac event population establish coronary heart disease ( e.g . 34 % Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study1 ) majority patient continue sudden unexpected cardiac event include sudden cardiac death . Indeed , 50 % patient establish CHD recurrent event despite aggressive management traditional risk factor hyperlipidemia , tobacco use hypertension . This suggest additional risk factor mechanisms participate pathophysiological cascade underlie acute CHD event . A large body evidence implicate psychosocial stress risk factor trigger myocardial ischemia , infarction sudden cardiac death , yet specific mechanism ( ) relationship remain investigation.2-9 The mechanism may include hemodynamic , hemostatic neuronally mediate effect cardiovascular system . Specifically may include prominent role cardiac autonomic nervous system , include sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) parasympathetic nervous system ( PNS ) .10 Indeed , cardiac arrhythmia implicate risk factor etiology sudden cardiac death , suggest alteration cardiac autonomic nervous system tone may provide opportunity reduce acute cardiac event sudden cardiac death . Prior work others also demonstrate sympathetic activation psychosocial stress result vascular constriction , presence impair nitric oxide ( NO ) production endothelial dysfunction , contribute myocardial ischemia adverse cardiac event , include sudden death . 6,8,11-15 Traditional Acupuncture ( TA ) Complementary Alternative Medicine ( CAM ) practice document effect improve physiologic imbalance reduce psychosocial stress . For example , TA technique show , significantly reduce mental stress humans16 , hypertension animal model17 angina pectoris CHD patients.18 These change consistent hypothesis TA technique directly alter autonomic nervous system tone , likely reduce SNS activity , possibly also increase PNS activity . We also hypothesize TA may beneficially alter CHD indirectly reduce psychosocial stress . Either hypotheses suggest CAM practice may serve complement alternative medical treatment prevention acute cardiac event sudden cardiac death . We propose evaluate effect TA arterial vasomotor function autonomic nervous system tone , two physiologic variable involve pathophysiological cascade underlie acute cardiac event sudden death CHD patient . To test hypothesize direct indirect effect CAM modality , propose compare active TA intervention two control group : 1 ) Alternative Acupuncture control group , 2 ) wait control group , patient CHD . Primary Aim 1 . To assess effect TA technique ( compare Alternative Acupuncture wait control ) cardiac autonomic nervous system tone , measure heart rate variability ( HRV ) use Holter monitoring . Secondary Aims 2 . To assess effect TA technique ( compare Alternative Acupuncture wait control ) CHD variables include marker inflammation ( high sensitivity C reactive protein ) , symptom ( Seattle Angina Questionnaire ) , functional status ( Duke Activity Status Inventory ) , blood lipoprotein , blood pressure . 3 . To assess effect TA technique ( compare Alternative Acupuncture wait control ) measure perceived psychological stress , depression , hostility , anxiety , social support , quality life . Exploratory Aims 4 . To estimate effect size TA technique ( compare Alternative Acupuncture wait control ) arterial vasomotor dysfunction , measure mental stress-brachial artery reactivity test ( BART ) use high frequency ultrasound . The result study : ) provide improve understanding hypothesize beneficial physiological psychological effect CAM practice , b ) serve potential pilot data multi-center TA proposal evaluate impact TA acute cardiac event , include sudden cardiac death .</detailed_description>
