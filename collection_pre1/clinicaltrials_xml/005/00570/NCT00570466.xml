	<brief_summary>Interactive multimedia program demonstrate produce substantial change child 's dietary behavior . This SBIR-Phase 2 protocol evaluate two video game intervention design change diabetes related behavior , include diet physical activity : Escape Diab ! Nanoswarm develop Phase 1 . The primary hypothesis SBIR-Phase 2 protocol : 1 . The two video game result great dietary physical activity change knowledge base control group . 2 . The effect video game mediate change child preference FV PA , self-efficacy change FV intake PA , intrinsic motivation eat FV PA. We test hypothesis evaluate two video game randomize experiment . To minimize cost , evaluate impact game behavior ( diet PA ) , BMI relate psychosocial variable , blood value . Our long-term goal reduce incidence Type 2 diabetes related health problem youth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computer Based Intervention Type 2 Diabetes Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing number minority youth risk develop Type 2 Diabetes ( T2D ) family history overweight . While precise incidence prevalence rate T2D among child available , prevalence increase substantially last ten year , likely due parallel increase obesity among child . These case expect progress end organ damage early age , resultant increase personal societal cost . Probable risk factor T2DM include ethnicity ( African American , Hispanic , Native American ) , family history diabetes , obesity . Prevention key reduce risk T2D . The modifiable risk factor weight , reflect dietary physical activity practice . A diet high fruit vegetable , appropriate total calorie low dietary fat likely protective obesity T2D . Although national data suggest percentage kilocalorie ( kcal ) fat consume child age 2-17 decreased 1989 1995 ( 33 % total kcal ) , actual fat intake decrease . Kcal intake , however , increase . Children 's current intake fruit vegetables less one-half 5-A-Day goal . Changing diet physical activity practice impact adiposity among child 10 12 year old onset obesity early obesity hold great promise prevent T2D . Furthermore , approximately age child assume responsibility diet physical activity , thereby intervention expect great impact behavior . Children 50 % tile high BMI likely progress obesity , thereby provide important target group obesity prevention . Video game focus promote T2D-related change diet physical activity , base current theory health behavior , hold promise prevent T2D among child , thereby reduce lifelong disease burden . Unlike traditional media-based intervention ( print , graphic , audio/visual , television broadcast ) , computer technology provide opportunity influence behavior change direct , personalize interactive experience . As part SBIR-Phase I , create two video game : Escape Diab ! Nanoswarm - Invasion Inner Space . These intervention video game propose increase fruit vegetable intake reduce total calorie displace high fat , high calorie food ; increase water intake decrease sweetened beverage consumption total calorie ; increase physical activity ; decrease inactivity ( e.g. , TV watching , play commercial video game ) . The behavioral educational objective address national behavior change objective , include : - Three five serving fruit ( F ) 100 % fruit juice ( J ) per day Four seven serving vegetable ( V ) per day ( base child recommend calorie intake age weight ) , - Five eight glass water ( W ) per day , - Moderate vigorous Physical Activity ( PA ) least 60 min/day , - Physical Inactivity ( PI ) ( TV , e-games , telephone ) 2 hour per day . Both game use adventure storyline capture child 's interest attention , thereby enhance desire keep come back game across multiple session ( behavior change goal attempt ) . The storyline provide message reinforce diet physical activity change objective . Seamlessly woven adventure session program procedure promote behavior change ( goal setting , goal review ) , tailor characteristic child obtain self report . Behavior change knowledge game , seamlessly woven storyline , use provide basis effective goal setting ; energy balance game , also seamlessly woven storyline , use provide knowledge necessary effectively self control caloric intake output .</detailed_description>
