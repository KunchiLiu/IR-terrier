	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Dasatinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well dasatinib work treat patient advanced lung cancer longer respond erlotinib gefitinib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib Treating Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer That Is No Longer Responding Erlotinib Gefitinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine overall response rate ( complete response partial response ) patient acquire erlotinib hydrochloride- gefitinib-resistant advanced adenocarcinoma lung treat dasatinib . Secondary - To determine progression-free survival overall survival patient treated drug . - To determine overall response rate patient EGFR T790M lung adenocarcinomas treat drug . - To determine progression-free survival overall survival patient EGFR T790M lung adenocarcinomas treat drug . - To determine toxicity profile dasatinib patient . OUTLINE : Beginning 1 week completion erlotinib hydrochloride gefitinib therapy , patient receive oral dasatinib twice daily . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Response assess CT scan 4 week , 8 week , every 8 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
