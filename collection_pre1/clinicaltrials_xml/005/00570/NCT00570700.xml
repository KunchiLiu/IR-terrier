	<brief_summary>The purpose research study find new anti-cancer drug , dasatinib ( Sprycel® ) , previously approve treatment form leukemia , safe helpful treat patient hormone-refractory prostate cancer . This research study study drug , dasatinib ( Sprycel® ) , evaluate safety effectiveness patient hormone-refractory prostate cancer . The drug approve Food Drug Administration treatment form leukemia ; thus , dasatinib ( Sprycel® ) investigational drug . It give safely hundreds patient already . However safety usefulness study population ( prostate cancer ) unknown . Subjects agree participate take 150mg ( 3 pill ) dasatinib ( Sprycel® ) daily mouth long drug benefit . During time , subject periodically return office blood/urine test , X-rays , image scan , and/or complete questionnaire .</brief_summary>

subject may include ( limited ) follow : HRPC subject treat palliative chemotherapy either fail respond , respond period time worsen disease ( i.e . relapsed/refractory chemotherapy ) ; HRPC subject treat palliative chemotherapy stop treatment toxicity ( i.e . intolerant chemotherapy ) ; HRPC subject treat palliative chemotherapy response , whose chemotherapy interrupt , evidence progressive disease ( i.e . potentially chemotherapy responsive subject desire restart cytotoxic drug ) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 , 2 Life expectancy least 8 week , base clinical judgment treat physician Adequate hematologic , renal liver function evidence follow ( subject may lower hematologic parameter cytopenias think treat physician secondary marrow involvement prostate cancer ) : white blood cell count ( WBC ) &gt;

= 14 day interval ] since previous nadir ) Ability take oral medication ( dasatinib must swallow whole ) Subjects reproductive potential must agree use adequate method contraception throughout treatment least 4 week study drug stop Signed inform consent document include Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) accord institutional guideline Concomitant Medications : Patient agree discontinue St. Johns Wort receive dasatinib therapy ( addition Patient agree IV bisphosphonates withhold first 8 week dasatinib therapy due risk hypocalcemia ) Subjects chemotherapy within 4 week start treatment dasatinib Prior localize radiotherapy metastatic disease permit , provide treatment volume less than25 % potential marrow space ( radiotherapy must complete 6 week prior enrollment ) Systemic radiotherapy samarium153 must complete least 2 month prior enrollment ( subject may receive prior strontium89 [ Metastron ] therapy ) At least 6 week elapse last dose cytotoxic target therapeutic time prescreening ; subject receive combination regimen standard chemotherapy plus investigational agent , 6 week washout period require Subjects may receive treatment kinase inhibitor At least 2 month must elapse time dose vaccine time prescreening No malignancy , prostate cancer , require radiotherapy systemic treatment within past 5 year Subjects may follow : Clinical evidence uncontrolled heart failure , myocardial infarction , angina within previous 6 month ; prolong QT interval Fridericia 's ( QTcF ) &gt; 450msec ; history unstable ventricular arrhythmia ( ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , torsades de pointes ) ; concomitant use drug know cause torsades de pointes [ quinidine , procainamide , disopyramide , amiodarone , sotalol , ibutilide , dofetilide , erythromycins , clarithromycin , chlorpromazine , haloperidol , mesoridazine , thioridazine , pimozide , cisapride , bepridil , droperidol , methadone , arsenic , chloroquine , domperidone , halofantrine , levomethadyl , pentamidine , sparfloxacin , lidoflazine ] ( agent must discontinue least 7 day prior start dasatinib ) ; subject hypokalemia hypomagnesemia exclude electrolyte anomaly correct Subjects may enrol follow : History significant bleeding disorder unrelated cancer , include diagnose congenital bleeding disorder ( e.g. , von Willebrand 's disease ) , diagnose acquire bleed disorder within one year ( e.g. , acquire antifactor VIII antibody ) ; GI bleeding cause within 3 month ; Concomitant use anticoagulant , except lowdose warfarin ( prophylaxis prevent catheter thrombosis ) heparin flush ( IV line ) , prohibit ( Note chronic use aspirin prohibit ) Subjects must meet following restriction : Subjects may concurrent medical condition may increase risk toxicity , include pleural pericardial effusion grade , uncontrolled hypertension ; Concomitant use H2 blocker proton pump inhibitor dasatinib recommend ( The use antacid consider place H2 blocker proton pump inhibitor patient receive dasatinib therapy ) ; Patient must discontinue St. Johns Wort receive dasatinib therapy ; Subjects must use intravenous bisphosphonates first 8 week dasatinib therapy due risk hypocalcemia ; Subjects may receive restricted cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) inhibitor ( If investigator feels agent give uniquely useful clear diagnosis , situation discuss Principal Investigator , clear monitoring program plan ) Subjects may evidence untreated intracranial metastasis , untreated prostate cancer produce spinal cord compression</criteria>
