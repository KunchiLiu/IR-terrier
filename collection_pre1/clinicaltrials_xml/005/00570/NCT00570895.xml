	<detailed_description>This study involve four outpatient visit . Two test meal give ( visit 2 3 ) two blood draw do ( visit 3 4 ) . A 2-3 hour fast prior visit require . Therefore , subject may come first thing morning ( breakfast meal ) , lunch , afternoon ( snack ) . Subjects may schedule come week weekend ; however , individual subject need return time day subsequent visit . Visit procedures describe . Visit 1 : Subjects admit GCRC outpatient 2-3h fast give reference dose 1mg iron-58 sulfate aqueous solution 50mg ascorbic acid . They observe 2h dose water freely available . No food allow . After 2h subject discharge home food allow . Visit 2 : One 10 day later subject admit outpatient 2-3h fast . They consume meal bread muffin label 4mg iron-57 ferrous fumarate , glass apple juice contain 0 25mg ascorbic acid . The order ascorbic acid supplementation non-supplementation decide random . No food allow meal . After 2h subject discharge home food allow . Visit 3 : Two week ( +/- 3 day ) later readmitted 2-3h fast second visit repeat . During admission apple juice contain either 0 25mg ascorbic acid , opposite give subject visit 2 . Immediately prior administration second test meal , 10mL blood drawn measurement iron nutritional parameter ( e.g . CBC , serum ferritin ) iron isotope ratio measurement . Incorporation iron-57 use calculate iron absorption test meal give visit 2 , incorporation iron-58 use measure absorption reference dose ( measure iron status ) . No food allow meal blood draw . After 2h subject discharge home food allow . Visit 4 : Two week ( +/- 3 day ) later subject admit 10mL blood draw describe . Incorporation iron-57 reflect absorption ferrous fumarate test meal give visit 3 .</detailed_description>
