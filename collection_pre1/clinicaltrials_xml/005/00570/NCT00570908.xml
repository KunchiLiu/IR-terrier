	<detailed_description>Central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases common type brain malignancy , breast cancer second common type malignancy cause CNS metastasis . Although incidence CNS metastases less common bone visceral metastasis , associate poor prognosis relatively unresponsive systemic therapy . The incidence CNS metastases breast cancer estimate 1-16 % clinical series , high rate ( 18-30 % ) autopsy series . Recently trend towards increase CNS relapse note , 25-34 % . This may partly explain increase use contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , heighten awareness patient clinician , alteration natural history breast cancer improvement systemic therapy , result prolongation survival . Therefore , improvement treatment , metastasis well control , result CNS become sanctuary residual disease . The treatment CNS metastases breast cancer remain challenge . Surgical resection tumor prolong survival patient single lesion well control systemic disease . For patient multiple lesion , whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) remain backbone management CNS metastases . Recently use stereotactic radiosurgery alone combination WBRT explore . Although good local control achieve combination therapy , minimal overall survival benefit see . This may secondary compete risk death systemic ( extra-CNS ) progression . The use systemic agent include chemotherapy hormonal therapy generally disappointing . This often attributed impermeability blood-brain blood-tumor barrier . Furthermore , P-glycoprotein ( Pgp ) , drug efflux pump encode multidrug resistance gene , mdR1 , express brain endothelial cell . Therefore , agent doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , 5-fluorouracil , paclitaxel , docetaxel vinorelbine , active breast cancer , may either penetrate CNS poorly , transport CNS environment . However , blood brain barrier may leaky permeable previously think patient CNS metastasis , agent may achieve therapeutic concentration CNS . As evidence , patient without prior exposure agent cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , 5-fluorouracil , vincristine , doxorubicin , significant objective response CNS metastasis . Today , patient would receive agent adjuvant setting , thus emphasize importance chemo-sensitivity together CNS penetration , treatment CNS metastases . This single arm , open label , phase II drug study . This study conduct Breast Care Center Baylor College Medicine affiliate hospital , Ben Taub General Hospital Houston . Patients diagnose CNS metastasis ( brain +/- leptomeningeal disease ) identify prospectively . All eligible patient receive capecitabine concurrently WBRT follow combination capecitabine sunitinib . WBRT administer 30 Gy 10 fraction together capecitabine give first day WBRT 1000 mg/m2/day continue daily 14 day . After 7 day rest period , capecitabine restart 2000mg/m2/day 14 day follow 7 day rest period . This give together sunitinib 37.5 mg daily . This dosing determine phase I study capecitabine sunitinib . Dose reduction and/or treatment postponement do significant toxicity . Capecitabine sunitinib administer disease progression either CNS and/or non-CNS site . Efficacy assessment perform subject via image study CNS extra-CNS sit 8 week start study , every 12 weekly . Neurological examination perform baseline , 3 week start treatment , every 6 weekly . Assessment treatment toxicity perform baseline , 3 week start treatment , every 3 weekly use NCI Common Toxicity grade system . Clinical laboratory parameter assess disease progression withdrawal study ( due unacceptable toxicity withdrawal consent ) . Subjects progression CNS / extra-CNS disease consider progressors . Subjects withdraw treatment follow survival death . Primary endpoint : 1 . To determine progression free survival . Progression define progression either CNS extra-CNS metastasis . Secondary endpoint : 1 . To assess toxicity associate regimen 2 . To determine overall objective response CNS disease 3 . To determine overall objective response extra-CNS disease 4 . To determine overall survival .</detailed_description>
