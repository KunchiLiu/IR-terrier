	<brief_summary>The primary objective trial ass safety tolerability inhale nitric oxide ( NO ) administer nasal cannula 44 hour period clinically stable Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) subject . Toxicity define drop oxygen saturation , decline force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) , increase methemoglobin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) autosomal recessive disorder cause mutation gene encode cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) protein . A cycle chronic , persistent infection CF-related pathogen excessive inflammatory response progressively damage airways lung parenchyma , result widespread bronchiectasis ultimately , respiratory failure . Despite tremendous advance understand CF gene CFTR protein , know exactly mutation gene defect CFTR lead persistent airway infection inflammation . Inhaled nitric oxide ( NO ) potential effective treatment CF lung disease . Inhaled NO studied airway diseases characterized infection /or inflammation COPD idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . NO show activate CFTR alternative chloride channel , thereby increase chloride current epithelial cell . Therefore , NO treatment may beneficial individual CF .</detailed_description>
