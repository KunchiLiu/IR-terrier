	<brief_title>Genetic Influences Albuterol Response In Children With Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchiolitis significant cause morbidity hospitalization child , account approximately 125,000 hospitalization per year U.S. Of hospitalized child , 8 % require intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission 67 % child require mechanical ventilation . Mortality previously healthy child generally low , however , child high-risk medical condition prematurity congenital heart disease , mortality high 3 % . In addition , bronchiolitis infection associate long term respiratory problem include development recurrent wheezing , airway hyperreactivity , asthma . Treatment bronchiolitis largely supportive . Despite four decade clinical trial , therapy demonstrate effective shortening either hospitalization ICU length stay child bronchiolitis . The use β2-adrenergic receptor ( β2-AR ) agonists received attention investigator , however result clinical trial contradictory inconclusive . Recently , investigator show genetic factor important influence patient 's response β2-AR agonist . Single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) amino acid position 16 β2-AR gene think functionally relevant . A change base 46 adenine guanine result amino acid sequence β2-AR contain glycine ( Gly ) , rather arginine ( Arg ) , amino acid position 16 . Patients homozygous Gly position ( Gly/Gly ) show improved response β2-AR agonist therapy compare child homozygous Arginine ( Arg/Arg ) heterozygous ( Arg/Gly ) . The next common polymorphism β2-AR gene , glutamine glutamic acid position 27 ( Glu27Gln ) , may associate development asthma airway hyperresponsiveness , relationships less clear . We believe genetic factor also influence response β2-AR agonist therapy child bronchiolitis . Specifically , believe β2-AR polymorphism amino acid position 16 affect response acute β2-AR agonist therapy child bronchiolitis . Our hypothesis child bronchiolitis homozygous glycine amino acid position 16 ( Gly/Gly ) improve response inhale β2-AR agonist therapy .</detailed_description>
