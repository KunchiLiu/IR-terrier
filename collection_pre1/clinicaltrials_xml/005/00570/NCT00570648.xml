	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : 1 % sodium hyaluronate ( Healon ) , applied end surgery surface corneal transplant shorten graft reepithelialization time compare coat nothing . We also wish measure compare visual acuity immediate post operative period . We also wish assess safety use agent epithelium post-operatively . We recruit 50 high risk patient ( see inclusion criterion ) University Virginia randomly receive nothing sodium hyaluronate ( Healon ) ocular surface end surgery , follow time reepithelialization corneal transplant graft .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Effect Topical Sodium Hyaluronate Immediately Post-PKP Time Reepithelialization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corneal transplant one common transplant procedure , 32,000 recipient United States 2005 similar number estimate 2006 . The immediate post-operative period important determine quality graft often overall chance survival . The corneal epithelium replace recipient epithelium transplant usually take place 1 week . This reepithelialization important healing , recovery epithelial barrier infectious agent , recovery vision graft . Grafts take long heal invite infection hinder visual recovery , permanently scar , thin , even perforate/fail . Thus rapid reepithelialization crucial . This become even crucial monocular patient need quick recovery . Currently universal agent use coat surface end surgery patching . Previous animal study show sodium hyaluronate promote rapid migration cell well stimulate cell proliferation lead rapid wound closure ( 1,2 ) . In 1987 one small study show topical sodium hyaluronate ( Healon ) may foster improve epithelial healing use intraoperatively presented technical challenge ( 3 ) . A recent non-randomized , retrospective study find sodium hyaluronate end surgery coat ocular surface shorten reepithelialization time . This comparison dexamethasone/oxytetracycline ointment neomycin/dexamethasone drop , hind reepithelialization ( 4 ) . To date know prospective , randomize , double-blinded study compare application sodium hyaluronate versus nothing ( currently practice UVA ) .</detailed_description>
