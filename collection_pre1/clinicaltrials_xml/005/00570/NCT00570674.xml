	<brief_title>Abraxane Combination With Carboplatin , Erbitux IMRT Locally Advanced Squamous Cancer Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives 1 . Phase I—To identify maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) Abraxane give carboplatin plus concurrent IMRT ( AC-RT ) 2 . Phase II—To evaluate efficacy phase II portion study evaluate 2-year disease-free survival Secondary Objectives 1 . To evaluate safety tolerability 2 . To estimate overall response rate 3 . To estimate 2-year overall survival 4 . To evaluate functional outcome 2 year respect speech , swallow overall quality life ( QoL ) , determine mean duration PEG-dependence change FACT-HN score baseline 3 , 6 , 12 24 month . STATISTICAL DESIGN : The Phase I study follow standard 3+3 dose escalation design . Four potential dose level Abraxane ultimately evaluation include de-escalation dose level -1 . [ Note : Erbitux originally plan give carboplatin Abraxane , remove due toxicity experience dose level 1 . ] The DLT observation period 7 week treatment . The Phase I incorporate a10-patient expansion cohort ensure toxicity MTD AC-RT acceptable . Planned enrollment Phase II study 34 patient primarily test whether 2-year disease-free survival consistent 75 % rate oppose null hypothesis 53.5 % base prior research ( RTOG 99-14 ) .</detailed_description>
