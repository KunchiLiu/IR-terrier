	<brief_summary>The purpose research study find effect , good and/or bad , Erlotinib Myelodysplastic syndrome . Myelodysplastic syndrome group blood diseases bone marrow ( spongy space long bone factory blood cell production ) make enough blood cell therefore lack healthy blood cell body . This result anemia , risk infection and/or bleeding..</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Erlotinib Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) Inhibitor Treatment Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MDS neoplastic clonal stem disorder characterize bone marrow failure cytopenia , dyslastic morphological feature tendency progress acute myeloid leukemia . It estimate MDS common hematological malignancy USA . Several treatment option available MDS range supportive care , growth factor use , chemotherapy , stem cell transplantation , new novel agent thalidomide , lenalidomide , hypomethylating agent . Each different available treatment MDS work certain subset relatively small percentage patient , keep door open novel therapeutic strategy explore . The NIH publish request application myeloproliferative myelopdysplastic syndrome emphasize need research area .</detailed_description>
