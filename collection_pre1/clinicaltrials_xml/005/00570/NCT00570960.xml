	<brief_summary>The core proposal prospective , randomize , double-blinded , control study compare efficacy dextran 70 versus human albumin treatment cirrhotic patient spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( SBP ) . Because dextran 70 , FDA approve plasma volume expansion , significantly less expensive human albumin , study design powered determine dextran 70 equivalent clinical efficacy compare albumin . Specific aim project : 1 . Assess effect plasma volume expansion dextran 70 disease-specific mortality 30 day cirrhotic patient spontaneous bacterial peritonitis compare plasma volume expansion human albumin . 2 . Assess effect dextran 70 compare human albumin prevention renal dysfunction within 30-days diagnosis SBP , measure calculated creatinine clearance , plasma renin activity , serum aldosterone level , level brain natriuretic peptide , development hepatorenal syndrome cirrhotic patient spontaneous bacterial peritonitis . 3 . Compare survival liver transplantation , treatment cost , hospitalization cost , resource utilization , quality life patient spontaneous bacterial peritonitis treat dextran 70 human albumin 30 day follow diagnosis . 4 . Establish comprehensive tissue bank blood , ascites , urine patient spontaneous bacterial peritonitis future test translational research . 5 . Establish clinical electronic database web-based data entry remote analysis capability link tissue bank sample patient outcomes related clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient admit University Virginia Health system clinically pathologically defined cirrhosis , laboratory evidence consistent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis clinically radiologically accessible ascites screen participation prospective , randomize , double-blinded , controlled trial . All patient agree participate treat standard care antibiotic supportive therapy randomize one two treatment regimen . Treatment arm one consist human albumin , 1.5 g/kg intravenously administer time enrollment 1.0 g/kg administer day three enrollment . Treatment arm two consist dextran 70 , 1.0 g/kg intravenously daily three day . Under separate inform consent therapeutic portion study , participant offer enrollment tissue repository prospective outcome database . Upon consent enroll repository database , serum , ascites , urine collect participate subject storage future evaluation inflammatory pathophysiologic factor contribute morbidity mortality SBP HRS . Prospectively collected clinical outcome data record perpetual electronic database future comprehensive outcome translational study . Participation either tissue repository perpetual clinical database compulsory enroll therapeutic prophylaxis trial . Similarly , subject choose enrol either database tissue repository . Comprehensive treatment cost incur treatment arm collect prospectively study personnel use perform formal cost-effectiveness analysis . Micro-costing algorithm use derive direct treatment hospitalization cost two treatment arm . After data collection complete , along primary statistical analysis , subgroup analysis perform good clarify benefit either treatment arm limit high-risk patient specific patient sub-populations . As proposed project first prospective , randomize , double-blinded investigation two markedly different therapeutic option treat SBP , study offer unique opportunity study objective fashion . All participant study receive standard care antibiotic therapy supportive care spontaneous bacterial peritonitis . Prior screening , paracentesis perform result ascitic fluid send lab cell count bacterial culture . Ascites culture medium inoculate bedside least 10ml fluid per culture container . Once diagnosis SBP establish , patient receive complete history physical examination , chest abdominal radiograph , ultrasound examination liver include Doppler exam hepatic vein , artery , portal vein evaluate thrombosis , peripheral blood laboratory test include complete blood count differential , standard serum chemistry electrolytes include blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) creatinine , liver panel assay include aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , total , direct , indirect bilirubin , prothrombin time ( PT ) , partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) , international normalize ratio ( INR ) , plasma renin activity ( PRA ) , serum aldosterone level , brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) level . Peripheral blood culture obtain standard fashion per institutional protocol inoculation blood body fluid sample directly culture medium bedside similarly , central line blood culture obtain applicable . Complete blood cell count , serum chemistry , hepatic panel repeat least daily first three day diagnosis least every week thereafter 30 day . Levels PRA , aldosterone , BNP measure study entry day two three protocol , day 30 . Baseline quality life assess enrollment 30 day . If subject consent tissue banking , sample blood , ascites , urine collect prepared storage study personnel . Tissue banking sample collect enrollment , 3 day , 30 day participate subject . After initial diagnostic paracentesis perform prior enrollment , total paracentesis perform ( do initial paracentesis ) . Colloid replacement initial paracentesis study drug . Further therapeutic paracentesis perform day three study protocol . Diuretic therapy continue patient clinical fluid control problem discretion medical team . However , diuretic use first three day protocol closely record study personnel . All subject place sodium-restricted diet , 2000 mg le per day . All subject allergic cephalosporin receive intravenous cefotaxime per dose regimen base upon serum creatinine level . Patients allergies sensitivity cephalosporin receive meropenem per dose regimen base upon serum creatinine level . If ascites blood culture grow specific bacterial pathogen , antibiotic therapy tailor narrow spectrum antibiotic necessary adequate coverage , base vitro organism susceptibility . If ascites still present , subject repeat diagnostic paracenteses 48 hour diagnosis repeat cell count assess response therapy . If ascites blood culture negative , antibiotic coverage continue total 5 day clinical laboratory resolution infection verify . If subject respond initial therapy measure ascites PMN 's decrease 50 % first 48 hour treatment , antibiotic regimen modify empirically primary medical team care patient . Once resolution infection establish , 5 day initial therapy , patient place ciprofloxacin , 750 mg weekly prophylaxis continue indefinitely . If patient sensitive allergic fluoroquinolones , trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg daily 5 day week use . Subjects randomize treatment human albumin receive total 1.5 g/kg albumin time enrollment 1.0 g/kg day three treatment protocol . To maintain blinding , research pharmacy prepare 25 % albumin solution order identical volume color dextran 70 use dextrose diluent . Because different dose schedule two treatment arm study , equivolume placebo dos dextrose ( 5 % ) give day two active treatment dose schedule albumin arm . Dextrose use avoid sodium load potential mild plasma volume expansion associate saline infusion . Subjects randomized treatment dextran 70 receive daily intravenous dose three day treatment protocol . A total daily dose 1.0 g/kg administer . Because hemodynamic compromise often delay 48 hour diagnosis SBP , daily dose dextran-70 , instead single dose regimen , well pharmacokinetic treatment strategy address gradually worsen hemodynamic status involve progression SBP HRS . In normal human , 45-60 % infused dose dextran-70 recover urine within 48 hour elimination half-life approximately 24 hour . As state , order preserve blinding , albumin , placebo , dextran 70 treatment equivolume visually indistinguishable . An intravenous multivitamin additive use dextran solution order assure 6 % dextran 25 % albumin solution color . This multivitamin diluent use successfully purpose blinded study UVAHS adverse event know benefit associate multivitamin component .</detailed_description>
