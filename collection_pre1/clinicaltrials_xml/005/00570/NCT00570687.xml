	<detailed_description>The original protocol randomize , open-label , 3-way cross-over study 9 schedule visit . The visit comprise initial screen visit , 3 treatment visit meal challenge follow 2-6-week blood-loss recovery period , interim safety visit , 3 sequential visit glucose clamp , final close-out visit . After review meal challenge data Original Protocol design , become apparent TI Inhalation Powder , insulin lispro , Exubera dose well match , result significantly high insulin exposure follow insulin lispro two inhaled treatment . All meal challenge visit complete 18 subject enrol . However , glucose clamp visit discontinue since discover direct comparison treatment possible . The protocol amend ( Amendment 1 ) ensure insulin exposure TI Inhalation Powder insulin lispro suit ( increase TI Inhalation Powder dos decrease insulin lispro dose ) . An Exubera arm include Amendment 1 due market removal product . Protocol Amendment 1 randomize , open-label , 2-way cross-over study 7 visit complete subject . The visit comprise initial screening visit , 2 treatment visit meal challenge follow 2-6-week blood-loss recovery period , interim safety visit , 2 sequential visit glucose clamp , final close-out visit .
