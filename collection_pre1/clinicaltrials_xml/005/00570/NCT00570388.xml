	<brief_title>Neurocognitive Functioning Following The PROMETA® Treatment Protocol In Subjects With Alcohol Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal aim study extend evaluation PROMETA® Treatment Protocol mean improve neurocognitive functioning recently detoxify alcohol dependent subject . For many alcohol dependent patient enter treatment , range neurocognitive deficit present adverse effect patient 's ability function think clearly deficit also impair process addiction treatment . For example , alcohol dependent subject typically experience high level alcohol crave early stage treatment . The patient leave choice relieve crave drink alcohol provide immediate relief crave symptom abstain alcohol obtain long-term benefit recovery complication excessive drinking . We previously show open label trial PROMETA® Treatment Protocol help stimulant abuser early stage recovery , relatively low rate relapse stimulant use . It clear Protocol effective less urge use stimulant ability resist urge improve recovery Neurocognitive functioning . The present proposal extend previous research compare efficacy PROMETA® Treatment Protocol double blind placebo control trial use new population substance abuser ( alcohol dependent subject ) assess effect PROMETA® Treatment Protocol neurocognitive functioning , particularly aspect function affect ability make decision important long-term benefit .</detailed_description>
