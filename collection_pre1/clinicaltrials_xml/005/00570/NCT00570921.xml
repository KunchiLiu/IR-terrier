	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine estrogen receptor-targeted therapy fulvestrant use combination Everolimus effective safe therapy woman hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer failure aromatase inhibitor therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Combined Fulvestrant Everolimus Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer After Aromatase Inhibitor Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fulvestrant , degrade ER , use aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) failure metastatic breast cancer resistance develop quickly . We hypothesize use everolimus inhibit mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) , key signal pathway endocrine resistance , may delay fulvestrant resistance patient thus improve efficacy . We conduct phase II trial combine fulvestrant everolimus postmenopausal woman disease progression relapse AI . Primary endpoint time progression ( TTP ) secondary endpoint include objective response rate , clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) , safety , biomarker correlate . Tumor block collect biopsy accessible tumor do future biomarker analysis .</detailed_description>
