	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether bevacizumab improve outcome treatment patient esophageal cancer whose disease confine esophagus closely surround lymph node .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Patients With Loco-Regional Esophageal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard treatment pre-operative chemotherapy radiation , follow surgery . In study , bevacizumab add pre-operative chemotherapy radiation , bevacizumab also administer year surgery . Bevacizumab humanize monoclonal antibody ( type protein normally make immune system help defend body infection cancer ) produce Genentech , Inc. use recombinant DNA technology . Bevacizumab approve FDA treatment metastatic colorectal cancer combination chemotherapy . Bevacizumab experimental treatment esophageal cancer approve FDA treatment esophageal cancer . Bevacizumab antibody direct vascular endothelial growth factor , VEGF . VEGF growth factor well defined role normal abnormal blood vessel formation . It present wide variety normal tissue , produce excess solid cancer ( tumor ) . In set cancer , VEGF promote growth blood vessel bring nutrient tumor cell . In study laboratory animal , bevacizumab inhibits growth several different type human cancer cell , include colon cancer cell , block effect VEGF . By block VEGF , doctor hope bevacizumab may decrease blood supply tumor , therefore decrease ability tumor grow come back chemotherapy , radiation , surgery .</detailed_description>
