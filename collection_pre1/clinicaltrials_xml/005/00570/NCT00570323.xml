	<brief_summary>Over last 3 decade , steady shift occur management breast cancer . Because traditionally view local disease , many advocate use radical surgery achieve maximum survival benefit . This view slowly replace broad biologic view recognizes often systemic nature breast cancer , even appear localized breast . Results randomize clinical trial demonstrate less extensive surgery , lumpectomy plus radiation therapy , optimal local management early breast cancer . In addition le radical approach surgical treatment breast cancer , randomize clinical trial establish value postoperative systemic therapy improve overall survival eradicate micrometastatic disease , major cause mortality breast cancer . Despite well-documented benefit adjuvant systemic therapy , effective prevent death breast cancer patient candidate treatment . The worth therapy judge retrospect upon disease relapse , time breast cancer nearly always incurable . Currently , reliable method predict success failure particular postoperative treatment modality , good way predict optimize outcome need . Combination endocrine therapy : Using endocrine agent different mechanism action together potential advantage effectively block ER signaling , thus improve efficacy agent breast cancer . In past , attempt combine endocrine agent ER-positive breast cancer mixed result , depend set patient population study . Endocrine agent without agonist effect could potentially use combination aromatase inhibitor , rationale combination would maximally blockade estrogen receptor signal , thus potentially improve antitumor effect . Fulvestrant ( FASLODEX ) pure estrogen antagonist know agonist effect ; thus , potential provide additional benefit combine aromatase inhibitor . This concept provide rationale use combination anastrazole fulvestrant study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose Objectives The primary objective study determine ER-targeted therapy , ARIMIDEX FASLODEX , use combination superior ARMIDEX alone hormone receptor positive breast cancer . Primary study objective 1 . To determine efficacy primary breast cancer , measure decrease proliferation ( KI67 ) , combination ARIMIDEX , FASLODEX high dose Secondary study objectives 1 . To study molecular change response treatment . 2 . To correlate change Ki67 clinical response 3 . To determine pathologic response rate . 4 . To assess tolerability safety combination regimen . This phase II randomize multi-center study . As indicated study design schema find protocol document attach Section S , patient initially randomize receive ARIMIDEX , ARIMIDEX+FASLODEX ( high dose ) 16 week ( 112 day ) . A computer-generated randomization scheme generate study statistician Breast Center , Baylor College Medicine . A 1:1 randomization scheme use permuted block employ . Randomization centralize Breast Center , Baylor College Medicine accomplish via access secure web-based procedure currently implement multi-center clinical trial . Enrollment , eligibility , randomization information store Oracle database Breast Center 's Sun server accessible secure web-based application . Communication pharmacy handle email contain patient identification number initial FAX hardcopy . The hardcopy use physician send pharmacy sign computer-generated pharmacy order legally dispense study drug . Within 30 day prior randomization subject sign study consent form , history physical exam , include concurrent medication . Blood drawn CBC , platelet , serum chemistry , BUN , creatinine , liver function test . If necessary determine menopausal status FSH , LH serum estradiol obtain . An EKG , CXR PA lateral perform bilateral mammogram US primary breast cancer do within 90 day randomization . Subjects randomize receive either ARIMIDEX 1 mg po q day ( Group A ) , ARIMIDEX 1 mg po q day FASLODEX 500 mg IM , day 1 , day 14 , day 28 thereafter every 28 day ( Group B ) . Study medication dispense within 60 day randomization . On day 28 , subject evaluate side effect second breast core biopsy obtain . Evaluation tumor response tolerability regimen evaluate every 28 day outpatient clinic visit . ALL treatment continue day 112 patient clinical response stable disease receive appropriate surgical resection . If tumor unresectable day 112 , core needle biopsy do . The surgical specimen obtain molecular analysis . After surgery , patient study receive additional breast cancer therapy discretion treat physician . Patients develop progressive disease protocol take study offer alternative treatment . All patient safety follow-up 1 month surgery ( alternative core biopsy ) . Treatment administer outpatient basis . After baseline breast biopsy , patient randomize receive ARIMIDEX 1mg po q day ( group A ) , ARIMIDEX 1mg po q day FASLODEX 500 mg day 1 , day 14 , day 28 , thereafter every 28 day ( Group B ) . After 28 day second biopsy obtain patient . All patient continue randomize treatment total duration study 112 day till day surgery . No investigational commercial agent therapy describe may administer intent treat patient 's malignancy . Study Visit Procedures : Pre-Study Procedures include follow : informed consent , breast biopsy , demographic , medical history , concurrent medication list , physical exam , blood draw , bidimensional tumor measurement , bilateral mammogram , primary breast ultrasound chest x-ray . Day 1 procedure include follow : study drug administration , clinic visit . Day 14 procedure include follow ( group B ) study drug injection clinic visit . Day 28 procedure include follow ( group B ) study drug injection . Both group A B , breast biopsy , concurrent medication list , physical exam , blood draw , clinic visit , adverse event evaluation , bidimensional tumor measurement . Day 56 procedure include follow ( group B ) study drug injection . Both group A B , concurrent medication list , physical exam , blood draw , adverse event evaluation , clinic visit bidimensional tumor measurement . Day 84 procedure include ( group B ) study drug injection . Both group A B , concurrent medication list , physical exam , blood draw , adverse event evaluation , clinic visit bidimensional tumor measurement . Day 112 procedure include study drug administration , concurrent medication list , physical exam , blood draw , adverse event evaluation , bidimensional tumor measurement , bilateral mammogram , primary breast ultrasound tumor resection . Day 140 procedure include blood draw , clinic visit safety evaluation adverse event . Duration Therapy In absence treatment delay due adverse event , treatment continue 4 month one follow criterion applies : Disease progression , Intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment , Unacceptable adverse event ( ) , Patient decide withdraw study , General specific change patient 's condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgment investigator . This protocol close 6 month last patient enrol . Patients receive study medication day 0 day 111 , day plan surgery . On day 140 , patient safety follow visit determine need treatment surgery . Breast Core Biopsy All subject breast tumor core biopsy begin study , second biopsy 2 week . Core needle biopsy plan provide sufficient histologically evaluable tissue assay propose study .</detailed_description>
