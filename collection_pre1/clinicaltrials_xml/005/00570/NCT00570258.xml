	<brief_summary>This multicenter , randomize , double-blind study fulvestrant plus erlotinib versus fulvestrant plus placebo subject metastatic breast cancer whose disease progression first line hormonal therapy . 1 . To obtain preliminary estimate magnitude variability efficacy fulvestrant combination erlotinib subject population , 2 . To obtain historically up-to-date estimate magnitude variability efficacy fulvestrant sole active agent subject population . The measure efficacy primary objective time progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized , Double Blind Multicenter Phase II Study Time Progression Fulvestrant Combination With Erlotinib Placebo Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer ( MBC ) Subjects Who Progressed First Line Hormonal Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize , double-blind study fulvestrant plus erlotinib versus fulvestrant plus placebo subject metastatic breast cancer whose disease progress first line hormonal therapy . - Total number subject plan trial 130 subject , , approximately 65 subject arm . - Subjects randomize receive fulvestrant/erlotinib ( arm A ) fulvestrant/placebo ( arm B ) stratify base accrual center . - The study parallel-arm double-blind study , fulvestrant + placebo monotherapy arm , fulvestrant + erlotinib combination arm . - The primary variable outcome time progression . - Subjects whose metastatic disease diagnose 12 month complete adjuvant hormonal therapy eligible study breast cancer hormone-receptor-positive disease progression first line hormonal therapy metastatic setting . Subjects may receive one line chemotherapy . While receive one line hormonal therapy metastatic setting requirement , receive chemotherapy , one line chemotherapy metastatic setting would exclude subject trial . Subjects recurrence adjuvant hormonal treatment within 12 month completion adjuvant hormonal treatment also eligible without need receive first line hormonal therapy metastatic setting .</detailed_description>
