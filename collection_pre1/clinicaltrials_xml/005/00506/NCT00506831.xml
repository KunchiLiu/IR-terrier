	<brief_summary>Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) autoimmune disease characterized fibrosis skin internal organ widespread vasculopathy . Patients SSc classify accord extent cutaneous sclerosis : patient limit SSc skin thicken face , neck , distal extremity , diffuse SSc involvement trunk , abdomen , proximal extremity well . The disease course vary depend subtype SSc . However , common feature result significant morbidity mortality , addition cutaneous fibrosis , include Raynaud 's phenomenon digital ulceration , interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) , pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . Current therapeutic option patient SSc clinical manifestation show limited efficacy . Imatinib antagonize specific tyrosine kinase mediate fibrotic pathway involve pathogenesis SSc , include c-Abl , downstream mediator transform growth factor ( TGF ) -beta , platelet derive growth factor ( PDGF ) receptor . The efficacy imatinib also report treatment patient refractory idiopathic PAH effect vascular remodel . Based mechanism action preliminary patient data , hypothesize imatinib may effective treatment fibrotic vasculopathic feature patient SSc . This open label pilot study evaluate safety efficacy imatinib patient progressive SSc refractory treatment ( ) . Validated measure skin thickness disease activity determine 6-months therapy compare baseline measure .</brief_summary>
