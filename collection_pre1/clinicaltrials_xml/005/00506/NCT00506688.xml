	<brief_summary>The majority cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patient die progressive pulmonary disease.Airway inflammation play major role pathogenesis CF lung disease , ultimately lead lung destruction . The release oxidants inflammation process lead chronic imbalance oxidant antioxidant may central component lead irreversible lung damage CF patient . The antioxidant glutathione , naturally occur tripeptide , deplete extracellular epithelial lining fluid CF lung . The elevation reduce level normal also augmentation glutathione concentration normal level , observed smoker defence Pseudomonas infection , may desirable avoid lung damage . Data pilot study humans animal indicate glutathione concentration epithelial line fluid elevate aerosol application . The main objective trial evaluate effect 24-week treatment inhale glutathione compare control inhalation ( normal saline ) pulmonary function adult pediatric CF patient . Secondary objective determine effect inhale glutathione inflammatory variable , glutathione level free elastase induce sputum evaluate safety tolerability 24-week treatment inhale GSH . There considerable hope within CF community addition anti-oxidative therapy already comprehensive program treating lung decrease morbidity improve quality life patient CF .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female patient , 8 year ( pediatric 8 17 year inclusive ; adult 18 year ) Confirmed diagnosis CF ( positive sweat chloride , 60 mEq/liter pilocarpine iontophoresis and/or genotype two identifiable mutation consistent CF accompany one clinical feature CF phenotype ) Patient able perform acceptable spirometric maneuver accord ATS standard FEV1 &gt; 40 % predict &lt; 90 % predict The patient clinically stable fulfil follow : No evidence acute upper low respiratory tract infection within 4 week screen . No pulmonary exacerbation require use i.v./oral/inhaled antibiotic , oral corticosteroid within 4 week screen . FEV1 Visit 2 within range Â± 10 % FEV1 Visit 1 . ( If FEV1 V2 within range , V2 may reschedule within 7 day ) Concomitant chronic medication plan continue unchanged entire study duration The patient patient 's legally acceptable representative able give inform consent accordance ICH GCP guideline local legislation Patient able comply study visit schedule willing able complete assessment specify protocol . History allergy/hypersensitivity ( include medication allergy ) deem relevant trial investigator . `` Relevance '' context refers increase risk hypersensitivity reaction trial medication . ( Specific concern currently identify respect use inhale glutathione allergic patient per se exist ) Concomitant inhale thiolcontaining medication ( e.g. , inhaled Nacetylcysteine ) . Such medication finish least 2 week screen visit . Oral Nacetylcysteine may continue . New oral inhale thiolcontaining medication ( e.g. , inhaled oral Nacetylcysteine ) throughout study period . Patient know relevant substance abuse , include alcohol drug abuse . Pregnant lactate woman female patient child bear potential sexually active use medically approve form contraception oral injectable contraceptive , intrauterine device , doublebarrier method , contraceptive patch , male partner sterilization condom . Patient document persistent colonization B. cepacia ( define one positive culture within past year ) . Start new concomitant chronic medication CF within 4 week screen . Existing cycle medication regimen without completion least 3 cycle prior screen visit drug cycle therapy accordance 4week timeschedule single visit study Clinically relevant diseases medical condition CF CFrelated condition , opinion investigator , would compromise safety patient quality data . This include , limited , significant hematological , hepatic , renal , cardiovascular , neurological disease ( diabetic patient may participate disease good control prior screen ) .
