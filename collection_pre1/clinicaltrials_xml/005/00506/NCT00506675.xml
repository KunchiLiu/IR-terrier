	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate effectiveness treatment residual amblyopia child age 3 &lt; 10 year visual acuity 20/32 20/63 amblyopic eye . The study randomize clinical trial compare intensive treatment ( 42 hour per week patch plus daily atropine ) control group rapid wean exist treatment follow spectacle correction ( need ) . The primary objective determine intensive treatment improve visual acuity patient residual amblyopia . The primary outcome assessment amblyopic eye visual acuity 10 week . The primary analytic approach amblyopic eye acuity treatment group comparison proportion patient least two line visual acuity improvement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Patching-Atropine Residual Amblyopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amblyopia common cause monocular visual impairment child young middle-aged adult . Both patch atropine accept treatment modality management moderate amblyopia child . Despite best effort conventional treatment , patient fail achieve normal visual acuity amblyopic eye . In randomized trial conduct PEDIG compare atropine versus patch 3 6 year old moderate amblyopia ( ATS1 ) , 261 402 patient ( 65 % ) amblyopic eye visual acuity 20/32 bad 6 month treatment patch atropine . Beyond 6 month , treatment investigator discretion , two year randomization , 181 363 child ( 50 % ) still amblyopic eye visual acuity 20/32 worse . In randomized trial conduct PEDIG compare patch regimen , 129 181 patient moderate amblyopia ( 71 % ) 145 157 patient severe amblyopia ( 92 % ) amblyopic eye visual acuity 20/32 bad 4 month occlusion therapy . Many patient receive treatment beyond 6 month still fail achieve normal visual acuity amblyopic eye . It unknown whether intensive `` final push '' combine treatment daily patch atropine improve visual acuity patient . Although clinician prescribe simultaneous patch atropine select patient , publish report effectiveness . Also , aware report response treatment residual amblyopia . The study design simple trial , type amblyopia therapy determine randomization process , approximate standard clinical practice . Patients randomize one two treatment regimen : - Intensive treatment : 42 hour per week patching combine daily atropine ( 1 % ) - Control group : Weaning current treatment ( two hour daily patch patient currently use patch weekly atropine patient currently use atropine ) 4 week , treatment spectacle ( need ) .</detailed_description>
