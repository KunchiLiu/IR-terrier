	<brief_summary>Marqibo ( liposomal vincristine ) form vincristine preparation . Vincristine design interfere multiplication cancer cell , may slow stop grow spread throughout body . This may cause cancer cell die . Liposomal vincristine form vincristine place inside oil droplet call liposome , may help improve delivery drug tumor site . The liposomal formulation result slow , steady release vincristine tumor metastasis , expose cancer cell vincristine continuously . The goal clinical research study learn Marqibo ( liposomal vincristine ) help control metastatic uveal melanoma . The safety liposomal vincristine also study . Approximately 50 patient take part study .</brief_summary>
