	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether low birth weight infant ( less equal 1250g 2 3/4 pound ) bear prematurely feed diet human milk human milk-derived nutrition well health outcome baby feed least formula ( make cow 's milk ) formula-derived nutrition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Study Human-Milk Based Nutrition Versus Formula Premature Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study evaluate short-term effect ( 90 day life ) purely human-based nutrition use mother 's milk ( available ) , donor milk preparation human-based fortifier ( Prolact+4 ) need compare mother 's milk supplement pre-term formula use bovine-based HMF ( need fortification mother 's milk ) , i.e . `` Study Group 1 '' ; , mother 's milk available , compare use donor milk ( plus human milk base fortification ) pre-term/term formula , i.e . `` Study Group 2 '' . In instance comparison base primary endpoint day TPN , parameter time full enteral feeding ( approximately 150-160 mL/kg/day ) , amount IV fluid support , culture-proven sepsis , NEC , death , growth short-term development , cultured-proven sepsis incidence feed intolerance either 2-arm ( human nutrition versus bovine nutrition : `` Study Group 2 '' ) 3-arm randomize design ( human fortifier give feeding reach 40 mL/kg/day , human fortifier give feeding reach 100 mL/kg/day , bovine-based HMF give feeding reach 100 mL/kg/day [ pre-term formula mother 's milk available ] : `` Study Group 1 '' ) . Statistically , study attempt evaluate null hypothesis equivalent result respect parameter either three type fortification `` Study Group 1 '' two type overall nutrition `` Study Group 2 '' , compare alternative inequality group , i.e . let μ mean number day TPN study arm , `` Study Group 1 hypothesis may write : H0 : μ control = μ human 40 = μhuman 100 HA : At least two μ control , μ human 40 , μhuman 100 equal , `` control '' bovine-based HMF group , `` human 40 '' human fortifier group start 40 mL/kg/day ( arm 2 ) `` human 100 '' human fortifier group start 100 mL/kg/day ( arm 1 ) . For `` Study Group 2 '' , compete hypothesis : H0 : μ formula = μ human HA : μ formula ≠ μ human , `` formula '' pre-term/term formula group `` human '' human-based ( donor milk/human-based fortifier ) group . In addition , data collect overall survival length stay NICU . Any baby complete full study period right-censored regard purpose data evaluation . For center obtain long-term follow ( 18-24 month ) patient , data developmental outcomes evaluate available .</detailed_description>
