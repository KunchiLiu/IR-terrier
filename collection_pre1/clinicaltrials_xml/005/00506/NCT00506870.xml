	<detailed_description>Rationale/context : Long term management anticoagulant treatment straightforward , especially patient bear mechanical heart valve due requirement maintain high INR narrow range . Due narrow therapeutic window AVK , undesirable event ( hemorrhage , thromboembolic accident ) tend serious common lead frequent admission hospital The self-monitoring AVK , addition conventional monitoring INR laboratory , introduce several country ( USA Europe ) . Main objective To evaluate benefit economic medical self-monitoring coagulation compare conventional follow-up anticoagulation population recently fit mechanical heart valve . Secondary objective To compare one year effect self-monitoring coagulation conventional follow-up anticoagulation : - impact complication stem oral anticoagulant treatment ( bleeding , thromboembolic episode death - proportion monthly value INR within target range , - inherent cost strategy monitor anticoagulation , - incidence death , bleed thromboembolic episode ( study separately ) - The quality life satisfaction patient To evaluate patient ' learn autonomous Diagram study Progress trial A national , multicenter , randomize , blind trial , design examine type strategy use monitor anticoagulation two parallel group : - conventional follow-up anticoagulation ( monthly check adjustment INR family doctor ( GP ) ) - self-measurement anticoagulation patient home use Roche Diagnostics Laboratories test CoaguChek XS® Hemosense laboratories test INRatio® ( weekly measurement adjustment INR family doctor ) + monthly laboratory check INR Inclusion criterion : - adult ( age ≥ 18 year ) , either sex - patient fit one mechanical heart valves either alone combination myocardial revascularization - oral anticoagulant treatment - patient social security cover - write informed consent sign patient investigator Exclusion criterion - woman pregnant liable become pregnant study - nursing woman - patient unable master self-monitoring procedure - individual judicial control enquiry - patient consume excessive amount alcohol ( ( &gt; 40g/j men et &gt; 30g/j woman femmes ; 1 glass = 10g ) - patient dialysis - patient incomplete understanding instruction - blind patient unable read - presence circulate anticoagulant Treatments/Strategies/Procedures : 1.1 . Strategies anticoagulation monitoring After signature inform consent verification criterion eligibility , patient randomly allocate follow group : 1.1.1 . Conventional follow-up anticoagulation In group , patient instruct use oral anticoagulant . INR measure month laboratory . INR must lie therapeutic range designate investigative center function type location valve associate risk factor . If necessary , family doctor adjusts INR day blood test new measurement take 48 hour later dosage change . This algorithm apply INR come designate range . 1.1.2 . Self-measurement anticoagulation In group , patient instruct use monitor oral anticoagulant . They train use self-monitoring test system . Reference INR INR labo first post operative week return home self-measurement anticoagulation maybe lack fact anaemia , inflammatory syndrome residue heparin . When patient return home , take measurement every week result abnormal , inform family doctor . The INR must lie within therapeutic range designate investigative center function type location valve associate risk factor . If necessary , family doctor adjusts INR day self-measurement . A measurement take 48 hour later dosage change . This algorithm apply INR come designate range . INR measure laboratory every month . Main evaluation criterion : Economic medical evaluation self-monitoring coagulation compare conventional follow-up anticoagulation population recently fit mechanical heart valve . Main secondary evaluation criterion : - impact complication stem oral anticoagulant treatment ( bleeding , thromboembolic episode death ) within population recently fit mechanical hear valve . - proportion monthly measurement INR within designate range , - inherent cost strategy anticoagulation monitoring , - impact death , bleed thromboembolic episode ( study separately ) , - Evaluation patient ' learn monitoring procedure . Planned population size : 1050 patient , i.e . - 350 group `` Conventional follow-up anticoagulation '' - 700 group `` Self-measurement anticoagulation '' : - 350 use Roche Diagnostics laboratories test CoaguChek XS® - 350 use Hemosense laboratories test INRatio® Time-line : - Period inclusion : 12-18 month - Duration participation patient : 12 month - Duration trial : 30 month</detailed_description>
