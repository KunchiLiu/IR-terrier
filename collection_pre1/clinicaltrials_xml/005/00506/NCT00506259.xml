	<brief_summary>This study examine effect bright light melatonin treatment sleep child Smith-Magenis syndrome ( SMS ) , genetic disorder characterize certain physical , behavioral developmental feature . Patients disrupt sleep cycle involve early waking , frequent daytime nap frequent nighttime awakening . Melatonin hormone normally produce night healthy people . People SMS produce high level melatonin daytime low level night . This may affect behavior , mood , attention span sleep pattern . Healthy volunteer 18 45 year age child SMS 3 16 year age may eligible study . Healthy subject admit NIH Clinical Center overnight . In morning take one dose time-release melatonin blood saliva sample collect hourly 7:00 AM 6:00 PM . Children SMS participate 2-part study , follow : Part 1 Inpatient Trial Pre-trial at-home phase : During month NIH inpatient admission , participant follow : - Wear actiwatch device keep daily sleep diary monitor daytime alertness , mood shift sleep pattern . - Complete behavior assessment survey relate child behavior sleep pattern . - Obtain frequent body temperature measurement . - Collect several saliva sample 24-hour period . NIH admission phase : - Children admit NIH Clinical Center 2-3 night bright light treatment . They remain room alternate period exposure standard dim room light bright light , use light box place within 3 5 foot child . An electroencephalogram ( EEG ) additional electrode track eye movement use monitor child attention . Between 8AM 6PM serial blood sample collect measure melatonin level . A parent rate child mood behavior 2-day test period . - Children admit NIH Clinical Center 2-3 night melatonin treatment . They take single dose melatonin placebo tablet bedtime . During daytime , EEG electrodes place track eye movement . Between 7 PM 7 AM serial blood sample collect measure melatonin level . A parent rate child behavior mood describe bright light study . - Children may receive either bright light melatonin treatment . Part 2 Outpatient Trial Children participate combine bright light melatonin trial home . They undergo procedure outline pre-trial at-home phase Part 1 ( actiwatch , behavior assessment , body temperature measurement , saliva sample ) 11-week period . If saliva sample collect melatonin testing , 24-hour urine sample may collect instead .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Strategies Children With Smith-Magenis Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smith-Magenis syndrome ( SMS ) rare ( 1/25,000 ) clinically recognizable syndrome , characterize follow feature : distinct pattern minor craniofacial skeletal anomaly , expressive speech/language delay , psychomotor growth retardation , strike neurobehavioral phenotype . This phenotype include stereotypies , self-injurious aggressive behavior , chronic sleep disorder associate inverted circadian melatonin rhythm . Sleep disturbance include daytime sleepiness , early sleep onset , early morning awakening . Disturbed sleep strong predictor maladaptive behavior child SMS . Diminished nocturnal sleep virtually universal SMS , represent major challenge patient family . The majority ( great 95 % ) case due interstitial deletion 17p11.2 ; however , rare case due RAI1 gene mutation also report . One likely contribute factor sleep disturbance inverse circadian pattern sleep-promoting hormone , melatonin . In SMS , plasma melatonin high day low night , opposite normal pattern . The underlying reason regular daytime melatonin secretory pattern unknown . To knowledge pattern distinctive person SMS find elsewhere . SMS therefore offer unique human syndrome study melatonin function . At present time , effective treatment sleep disturbance SMS . Moreover , currently control treatment trial underway U.S. specific goal correct disturbed sleep pattern observe disease . The aim Phase 1 treatment trial improve quality nocturnal sleep decrease need daytime sleep restore normal circadian pattern melatonin level child Smith-Magenis syndrome ( SMS ) . We predict inverse pattern release correct combination non-pharmacological suppression daytime melatonin release pharmacological replacement nocturnal melatonin . Negative behavior associate accumulated sleep debt expect diminish sleep quality improves . Two treatment modality evaluate alone combination : 1 ) light-induced suppression daytime melatonin release delay nighttime sleep ; 2 ) pharmacological replacement nocturnal melatonin . Melatonin level measure blood ( Pre- vs. Post-treatment ) serve primary outcome parameter . A dTR-melatonin tablet develop Clinical Center Pharmaceutical Development Services ( CC-PDS ) use trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : SMS subject enrol protocol 01HG0109 invited participate study . Protocol 01HG0109 approximately 90 SMS subject . SMS inpatient admission dTRMT trial defer BL study complete 10 SMS subject demonstrate expect SMS invert diurnal MT profile baseline ( T0 ) . SMS Subjects ( N=1215 per treatment goal ; 60 total enrollment ) : Male female , childhood ( average 516 year old ; age 5 year casebycase basis ) , ethnicity confirm diagnosis SMS ( del 17p11.2 ) . In case , molecular cytogenetic FISH screening ( RAI1 FISH probe ) may require confirm SMS diagnosis prior enrollment . Prepubertal ( less equal Tanner stage II ) . No history seizures Priority give subject medication free and/or willing discontinue sleep/behavioral medication study trial . We anticipate significant interest family whose child currently enrol 01HG0109 protocol . We also consider drugfree new referral ( selfreferrals and/or via health care provider ) eligible enrollment . Documented sleep disturbance ( sleep log diary and/or actigraphy ) . Unaffected Healthy Control Subjects ( N=15 ) . The pharmacokinetics melatonin release dTR tablet evaluate unaffected healthy control subject prior use inpatient SMS trial . Males females ethnicity age 1845 year . Regular ( 11PM 7AM ) sleep schedule least 1 week prior study . Nonsmokers , history seizure . Willing discontinue coffee consumption period 12 week prior trial . BMI within normal limit ( 1090 percentile ) . Unaffected SMS . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : SMS Subjects : Inability obtain informed consent . Failure confirm clinical diagnosis SMS standard molecular cytogenetic ( FISH ) method and/or DNAbased mutation analysis RAI1 gene . Retinal disease : macular degeneration , retinitis pigmentosa , diabetes , cataract . Skin disease : Lupus ( lupus erythematosis ) , history skin cancer , history adverse reaction ( ) sun ( rash , redden ) . Medications photosensitize : Phenothiazines ( Thorazine , Stelazine ) , Imipramine ( AD ) , Porphyrins ( antitumor ) , Chloroquine ( antimalarial ) , Hydrocholorthiazine ( antihypertensive , diuretic ) , Lithium ( mood stabilizer ) and/or antibiotic ( Tetracycline ) . SMS subject extensive medication use may exclude , depend medication use whether discontinue medication trial present significant health risk . These include medication might affect daytime vigilance ( e.g. , seratonin antagonist Trazadone , SSRIs ) and/or MAOIs , and/or antipsychotic ( Risperidone ) , and/or SSRIs ( e.g. , fluvoxamine ) affect metabolism melatonin and/or strong CYP1A2 inhibitor . Healthy Adult Controls : Individuals diagnose sleep disorder ( e.g , restless leg , sleep apnea ) know impact sleep may exclude discretion PI . Not willing discontinue caffeine consumption ( chocolate , coffee , tea ) study period . Persons extensive medication use may exclude , depend medication use whether discontinue medication trial present significant health risk . These include medication might affect daytime vigilance ( e.g. , seratonin antagonist Trazadone , SSRIs ) and/or MAOIs , and/or antipsychotic ( Risperidone ) , and/or SSRIs ( e.g. , fluvoxamine ) affect metabolism melatonin and/or strong CYP1A2 inhibitor .
