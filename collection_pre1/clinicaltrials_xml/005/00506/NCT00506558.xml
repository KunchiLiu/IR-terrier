There establish guideline management patient CSM , slowly cause spinal cord injury afflict patient . This study aim test hypothesis ventral surgery ( decompress spinal cord front neck ) dorsal surgery ( decompress spinal cord back neck ) might differ overall outcome major complication rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The CSM Trial : A Multicenter Study Comparing Ventral Dorsal Surgery Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A . Purpose To determine optimal surgical approach ( ventral versus dorsal ) patient multi-level cervical spondylotic myelopathy ( CSM ) . B . Background There establish guideline management patient CSM . It estimate 30 percent patient unsatisfactory outcome surgery CSM . It remain uncertain dorsal ventral approach differ success rate complication rate . This study aim test hypothesis ventral dorsal surgical approach differ outcomes major complication rate . A secondary hypothesis fusion might improve outcome reduce repetitive shear injury spinal cord . C. Specific Location Study This multi-center trial . Subjects enter study 9 separate center . At site , subject recruit office Dr. Zoher Ghogawala . All subject site undergo surgery Greenwich Hospital . D. Probable Duration Project Subjects recruit study one year . All subject follow 1 year . E. Research Plan 1 . Prospective , non-randomized multicenter trial . Approximately 100-200 patient would recruit one year follow-up one year . 2 . Subjects ( age 40-85 year ) spinal cord compression ( 2 level ) degenerative cervical spondylosis clinical myelopathy treat either ventral decompression/fusion dorsal decompression without fusion . 3 . Subjects cervical kyphosis &gt; 5˚ , segmental kyphotic deformity define 3 disc-osteophytes extend dorsal line draw dorsal caudal point C2 dorsal caudal point C7 , ossification posterior longitudinal ligament ( OPLL ) , developmental spinal canal narrowing ( 12mm ) would exclude study . 4 . Functional outcome determine use well-known quantitative scale ( SF-36 , Oswestry Neck , mJOA , Nurick , EuroQol-5D ) . These instrument administer pre-op , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year post-op . 5 . Two independent neuroradiologists review initial film confirm eligibility review post-operative film ( 3 month , 6 month , 1 year ) determine radiographic decompression fusion well complication . 6 . An independent study coordinator collect data 30 day 1 year document complication re-operations . F. Data Safety Monitoring Plan 1 . All serious unexpected adverse event ( e.g . death within 30 day operation ) report IRB within 24 hour . Any appropriate funding agency regulatory agency would notified well . 2 . Any serious anticipated adverse event ( e.g . wound infection , pulmonary embolus ) report IRB whenever magnitude frequency exceed expectation . 3 . All adverse event ( include loss privacy , significant economic harm ) report IRB annual basis time re-approval sought . Any adverse event judge unlikely unrelated study also include annual report IRB . G. Statistical Considerations 1 . Specific data variable collect study . The data collection sheet submit along protocol . There several data sheet follow : 1 ) Spine surgeon 's data sheet , 2 ) 30-day 6-month morbidity data sheet , 3 ) 1-year morbidity data sheet , 4 ) SF-36 questionnaire ( pre-op , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year ) , 5 ) Oswestry Neck Disability Index questionnaire ( pre-op , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year ) , 6 ) mJOA , ( pre-op , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year ) , 7 ) Nurick questionnaire ( pre-op , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year ) , 8 ) EuroQol-5D ( pre-op , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year ) , 9 ) Radiology Review ( pre-op , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year , 2 year ) . 2 . Study endpoint . Patients follow 1 year . The primary endpoint SF-36 physical component summary score ( PCS ) Oswestry Neck Disability Index . Secondary endpoint include Nurick , mJOA , EuroQol-5D score well observed complication rate . Radiographic fusion , instability , deformity also secondary outcome . 3 . Statistical Methods . Analysis focus physical component summary ( PCS ) SF-36 , Oswestry Neck Disability index , major complication rate . The t-test use compare group continuous variable SF-36 PCS Oswestry Neck Disability Index . The Chi-square test use compare group 's complication rate . Multiple regression technique apply control potential confounders include age , medical condition , number stenotic level , degree lordosis kyphosis , etc . 4 . Power Analysis . The data generate SF-36 Oswestry Neck Disability Index use calculate sample size future randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare ventral dorsal surgery . If significant difference identify primary outcome measure , sample size calculation do use difference major complication rate .</detailed_description>
