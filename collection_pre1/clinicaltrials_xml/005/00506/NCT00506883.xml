	<detailed_description>This study multi-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group trial compare efficacy safety standard-dose colchicine ( STD ) ( total dose = 4.8 mg ) versus low-dose colchicine ( total dose 1.8 mg ) placebo treatment acute gout flare . Eight hundred thirteen patient confirm diagnosis gout screen . 238 screen patient fail screen ; 235 ( 98.7 % ) fail meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . The 575 eligible patient randomly assign ( 1:1:1 ) one three treatment group . At randomization visit investigator dispense blister card contain eight identical look capsule ( combination active drug placebo capsule ) double blind fashion use next gout flare . Patients instructed self-initiate treatment study medication within 12 hour gout flare onset . Gout flare determine call Gout Flare Call Center establish purpose . At Investigator discretion , rescue medication could also provide , patient encourage use rescue medication within first 24 hour start treatment study drug . Of 575 study participant , 185 qualify gout flare 390 . Patients use diary record study drug administration , pain score , presence absence gastrointestinal adverse event ( nausea , vomit , diarrhea , abdominal pain ) timing rescue medication use prior beginning treatment 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 , 56 , 64 , 72 hour start dose . The pain score base scale 1 - 10 1 pain 10 bad pain imaginable . Efficacy define 50 % reduction pain score target joint 24 hour patient use rescue medicine . The primary efficacy analysis base Intent-to-Treat ( ITT ) population , define patient randomize , contact Call Center , instruct begin take study drug . An otherwise qualified patient exclude ITT population patient return study drug blister pack completely unused . Secondary outcome measure compare efficacy STD dose colchicine low dose regimen placebo use criterion efficacy primary outcome measure . Additional secondary outcome measure time 50 % 90 % reduction pain target joint analyzed treatment group use Kaplan-Meier method , change mean pain intensity 0 72 hour plot time point treatment group . All safety analysis carry use safety population define patient receive least one dose study medication regardless authorization Call Center To determine safety colchicine administer via two different dose regimen patient gout flare see investigator soon possible onset evaluate flare adverse event resolve . All adverse effect , whether record patient diary obtain systematic evaluation investigator record report tabular form . Treatment-emergent adverse event ( TEAE ) summarize MedDRA System Organ Class prefer term tabulate accord treatment arm , overall incidence , severity relationship study medication . Multiple event within patient count great severity closest relationship study medication .</detailed_description>
