	<brief_title>Enhancing Slow Wave Sleep With Sodium Oxybate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SWS hypothesize time relatively high neural recuperation wakefulness . That hypothesis prompt number observation , include : 1 ) enhance SWS follow sleep deprivation proportion duration prior wakefulness , 2 ) reduce amount SWS nocturnal sleep follow afternoon/evening nap , 3 ) gradual decline SWS across night sleep , 4 ) increase SWS follow night fragment sleep . Within two-process model sleep regulation , heighten SWS view reflect Process S , homeostatic component . Many author propose increase SWS represent ongoing cortical recovery prior wakefulness activity time relatively heighten neurophysiologic restoration recuperation . In prior study conduct ( Walsh et al. , 1994 ) suggestion , post hoc analysis , SWS may prevent adverse effect sleep loss . Additionally , recently publish result investigation pharmacologically-enhanced SWS ( tiagabine ) sleep restriction demonstrate preserved neurobehavioral performance despite sleep restriction ( Walsh et al , 2006 ) . In propose research examine whether pharmacological enhancement SWS sodium oxybate reduces impact sleep deprivation upon sleepiness , attention , performance , mood , autonomic nervous system activity .</detailed_description>
