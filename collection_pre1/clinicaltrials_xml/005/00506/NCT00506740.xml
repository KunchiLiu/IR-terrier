	<brief_title>Harmonic™ vs. Electrocautery Abdominoplasties</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abdominolipectomy perform correct abdominal skin fat redundancy muscle diastasis . Persistent serous wound drainage seromas common complication abdominolipectomy . The rate serous fluid collection determines time drain need remain place . Although suction drain reduce seroma formation , prolong use delay healing , cause injury , increase risk retrograde infection patient discomfort . Wound drainage direct correlation seroma formation . The loss protein nutrient mineral serum drain also concern prolonged drainage result healing delay . The Harmonic™ technology use ultrasonic energy allows cut coagulate precise point application . The Harmonic™ use since 1992 predominantly urology gastro-intestinal surgery ( laparoscopic surgery ) . Significantly reduce serous drainage number general surgery procedures superficial total parotidectomy ; thyroidectomy ; tonsillectomy ; pectoralis major myocutaneous flap dissection ; axillary dissection ; lymphadenectomy report use Harmonic™ . The Harmonic™ also use parotidectomy maxillofacial surgery , use seldom mention field plastic reconstructive surgery . Recent use Harmonic™ show promise plastic reconstructive surgery dissection pectoralis major myocutaneous flap total body lift . Comparisons : The Harmonic™ vs. electrocautery abdominolipectomy .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects eligible clinical research study must fulfill follow criterion : Elected undergo full abdominoplasty procedure aesthetic postobesity reason Able comprehend sign study inform consent form Able return study mandate postoperative visit ( 34 day removal drain , well 15 ± 2 day , 30 ± 5 day surgery ) ; Be great equal 18 year age . Subjects follow criterion eligible participate clinical research study : Current smoker Current use steroid Diabetes Mellitus Need lipocontouring , complementary liposuction flank Need full body lift ( belt lipectomy ) Need concomitant surgical procedure via abdominal flap ( hernia repair , rectus plication , liposuction flank ) procedure wound drainage would interconnect abdominal wound . Presence ventral umbilical hernia require repair use prosthetic material ( e.g. , mesh ) Morbid obesity ( BMI ≥ 40 ) At risk ischemia due presence obstruction arterial blood supply inadequate blood flow Presence midline scar could limit flap advancement limit infraumbilical region completely excise Right , leave , bilateral upper quadrant scar , ( e.g. , previous laparotomy via sub costal incision ) Heart disease History thromboembolic disease Current diagnosis history disease would impair heal process Current diagnosis history immune system disorder History bleed disorder Presence uncontrolled hypertension Pregnant lactate Being treated anticoagulant include aspirin within 7 day prior surgery ( washout period 7 day require ) ; Participation clinical study .</criteria>
