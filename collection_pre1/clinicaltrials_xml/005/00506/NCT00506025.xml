	<brief_summary>This study help determine drinking cranberry juice decrease risk asymptomatic bacteriuria ( ASB ) . ASB occur bacteria urine without symptom . It also see difference effect pregnant non-pregnant women.This research project also design see happen bacterial bind lining bladder drinking cranberry juice special problem occur pregnancy diabetes ( sugar metabolism problem ) ASB already occur .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Cranberry Ingestion Bacterial Adhesion : An Adjunct Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study adjunct proposal premise daily cranberry ingestion pregnancy may effective preventative approach development asymptomatic bacteriuria ( ASB ) , condition predisposes preterm birth upper urinary tract infection . We propose NCCAM pilot randomize , control trial ( RCT ) pregnant woman beyond 12 week ' gestational age assign one three schedule cranberry ingestion : Group A consume cranberry juice twice day breakfast dinner ; Group B consume cranberry juice breakfast follow placebo dinner ; Group C consume placebo meal . Both cranberry juice placebo scientific grade , provide NIH-contractor . Both well-characterized , present low-carbohydrate load low-calorie content per dose ( 40 cal per 8 oz . dose ) . Our intent 1 ) generate data compare frequency asymptomatic bacteriuria pregnant woman consume cranberry juice daily versus placebo , 2 ) create infrastructure complete pilot study gather sufficient data support R01 large , multi-center RCT focus prevention ASB pregnancy daily cranberry juice ingestion . The reviewer proposal enumerate specific weakness include 1 ) need evaluate urine cranberry treat patient , 2 ) consideration bacterial virulence/adherence . The additional variable gestational diabetes also receive comment reviewer , acknowledge predisposition Hispanic population obstetrical complication could impact result . A constituent cranberry fructose , implicated inhibition E. coli type 1 fimbria ( mannose-sensitive ) ( 2 ) . We hypothesize glucosuria associate diabetes pregnancy may influence effectiveness cranberry prevent asymptomatic bacteriuria . We must address weakness strengthen chance continued fund competitive renewal . We make inquiry researcher , discover direct urine serum assay measure cranberry metabolite . We understand R21 proposal consideration develop urinary assay purpose RFA . Amy Howell , PhD , Marucci Center Blueberry/Cranberry Research Rutgers University , one field 's foremost researcher field , others indirectly assay compliance cranberry evaluate adherence piliated E. coli strain cranberry exposure ( 1 ) . In response recent call proposal faculty research UCI Committee Research , I propose pilot study collaboration Dr. Howell . In proposal , collect urine various participant R21 trial characterize effect cranberry juice ingestion bacterial adherence . We ask woman collect urine four-hour time period include first-morning void . The urine sample send Dr. Howell 's laboratory Rutgers University analysis . We collect urine pregnant woman assign cranberry placebo , woman develop bacteriuria follow cranberry follow placebo ingestion . We also plan identify group reproductive age , healthy , non-pregnant woman ingest active cranberry product placebo three day , third day , collect four-hour timed sample manner pregnant woman control group .</detailed_description>
