	<brief_summary>Objectives : - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) imatinib mesylate combination fix dose paclitaxel patient stage IIIC , IV recurrent uterine papillary serous carcinoma . - To determine nature degree toxicity imatinib mesylate paclitaxel cohort patient . - To determine efficacy imatinib mesylate paclitaxel patient stage IIIC , IV recurrent uterine papillary serous carcinoma whose tumor express either c-Kit , PDGFR abl .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before possible study participant receive treatment imatinib mesylate paclitaxel , tumor tissue previously collect ( surgery diagnose tumor ) test follow three biomarkers : c-Kit , PDGFR-B , Abl . Those participant least one positive biomarker eligible treatment study . Paclitaxel chemotherapy drug use treatment ovarian cancer . Imatinib mesylate medication block several protein important development cancer . Before treatment start , complete physical exam , routine blood test ( 2-3 teaspoon ) , electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) . You echocardiogram ( ultrasound test use visualize structure heart ) , chest x-ray , CT scan MRI abdomen pelvis . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . Routine blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) do weekly treatment , course therapy , every 3 week . A complete checkup include evaluation side effect , also do course therapy end therapy ( 3 week treatment end ) . There two phase study , Phase I Phase II . If assign Phase 1 , receive treatment imatinib mesylate paclitaxel . Phase 1 study 3 different dos imatinib mesylate combination fix dose paclitaxel . The Phase I part study help researcher learn effective dose imatinib mesylate use combination paclitaxel . All participant Phase 1 receive one three dos imatinib mesylate give standard dose paclitaxel . You assign specific dose level base number participant treat time enrollment . The Phase II portion study begin effective dose imatinib mesylate determine . If assign Phase II , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two treatment group . Participants one group receive treatment paclitaxel ( every 21 day ) . Participants second group receive treatment paclitaxel ( every 21 day ) along imatinib mesylate ( every day ) . The dose level imatinib mesylate receive dose use Phase I . The computer-generated assignment favor treatment group effective . For example , combination paclitaxel imatinib mesylate effective paclitaxel alone , patient select receive combination therapy . You receive paclitaxel vein 3 hour every 21 day . Those participant assign treatment paclitaxel imatinib mesylate begin take imatinib mesylate day first dose paclitaxel . A single dose imatinib mesylate take mouth every day . Evaluation tumor response ( participant already disease ) determine CT scan MRI chest x-ray ( patient chest disease ) . These scan take Courses 2 4 , every 3 course therapy finish , end therapy . Patients show sign disease give total 6 course . Patients disease may continue treatment disease get bad . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . If remove study , ask follow-up CT scan MRI chest x-ray evaluate tumor . THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY . Paclitaxel commercially available approve use treatment ovarian cancer . GleevecÂ® also commercially available approve use treatment certain type adult leukemias stomach cancer . The combination paclitaxel imatinib mesylate still investigational approve use research . At least 51 many 65 participant take part study . All participant enrol treat M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically confirm newly diagnose ( stage IIIC IV ) recurrent ( stage ) uterine papillary serous carcinoma . Patients recurrent disease may treat taxanes past . 2 . Patients may receive concurrent radiotherapy participate protocol . 3 . Patients may measurable nonmeasurable disease . 4 . Patients may mix endometrioid clear cell component addition serous histology . 5 . Patients ' tumor tissue must express one follow biomarkers : cKit , PDGFRB , Abl . Positivity define 2+/3+ intensity least 10 % tumor . 6 . Patients must pretreatment granulocyte count ( i.e . segment neutrophils band ) &gt; /= 1,500/Fl , hemoglobin level &gt; /= 9.0 gm/dl , platelet count &gt; /= 100,000/Fl . 7 . Patients must adequate renal function document serum creatinine &lt; /=2.0 mg/dl . 8 . Patients must adequate hepatic function document serum bilirubin &lt; /=1.5mg/dl , regardless whether patient liver involvement secondary tumor . Alanine aminotransferase ( SGPT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( SGOT ) must &lt; /=2.5x institutional upper limit normal unless liver involved tumor , case level must &lt; /=5x institutional upper limit normal . 9 . Zubrod performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . 10 . Patients receive prior chemotherapy radiation ( except palliative radiation ) within last 30 day . 11 . Patients must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study . 1 . Patients previously receive imatinib mesylate taxanes . 2 . Patients active uncontrolled systemic infection , include know HIV infection . 3 . Patients psychiatric disorder would interfere consent followup . 4 . Patients New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III/IV congestive heart failure , unstable angina history myocardial infarction within previous 6 month . 5 . Patients history prior malignancy except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer patient diseasefree least three year . 6 . Oxygendependent lung disease . 7 . Patients corticosteroid contraindicate . 8 . Uncontrolled severe hypertension uncontrolled diabetes mellitus . 9 . Presence clinically apparent central nervous system metastases carcinomatous meningitis . 10 . Patients form chronic liver disease . 11 . Patients history seizures ineligible . Patients receive phenytoin , phenobarbital , antiepileptic prophylaxis ineligible . 12 . Patients severe concurrent disease , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study , include significant hepatic , renal , gastrointestinal disease . 13 . Patients deep venous arterial thrombosis ( include pulmonary embolism ) within 6 week study entry . 14 . Patients receive therapeutic dos warfarin blood thinning agent . 15 . Patients history noncompliance medical regimen consider potentially unreliable . 16 . Pregnant lactating woman .
