	<brief_title>Pilot Efficacy Study T2000 Myoclonus Dystonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myoclonus Dystonia ( M-D ) rare , inherited movement disorder patient experience myoclonus - sudden , brief , jerky involuntary motion , often association dystonia - involuntary sustain contraction cause twist abnormal posture . While M-D patient respond significantly alcohol , approve medication M-D. A variety medication currently use treat M-D , treatment work small proportion patient provide partial improvement symptom ; use also limit side-effects many patient . T2000 medication currently development treatment movement disorder , include essential tremor ( ET ) . Although T2000 new medication , belong class medication use many year treatment variety medical condition . In previous study , T2000 appear effective controlling symptom ET patient severe ET major improvement tremor . As would expect medication class , T2000 cause sedation high blood level , may see large dos give old individual . In young patient , T2000 cause minimal side effect even administer high dos period several week several month . The current study evaluate safety efficacy T2000 patient M-D . Patients receive dos T2000 begin 200 mg day increase every week additional 200 mg day maximal dose 1000 mg day . The total duration treatment 12 week . Patient 's symptom myoclonus dystonia , well overall neurological examination , monitor throughout study . The response T2000 determine compare severity myoclonus dystonia patient receive T2000 compare symptom observe without active medication .</detailed_description>
