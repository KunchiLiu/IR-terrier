	<brief_title>Lipid Infusion Dialysis Patients With Endotoxemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 70 % dialysis patient suffer chronically severe fatigue tiredness . A possible inciting factor may high level circulate endotoxin , well-established potent stimulator inflammatory cytokine release . The source increase endotoxin dialysis patient remain unclear , popular hypothesis include back-diffusion bacterial product nonsterile dialysate translocation bacterial product across dialysis patient edematous gut wall . This endotoxin appear associate dialysis procedure indeed , appear cleared efficiency procedure . However , next dialysis treatment , endotoxin level rise rapidly level case significantly high even measure ( via EAA ) patient suffer septic shock . Although mechanisms dialysis patient tolerate high endotoxin level without hemodynamic collapse understood , high level show The Rogosin Institute significantly correlate patient fatigue . Given potent ability endotoxin induce expression inflammatory cytokine ( turn likely responsible debilitate symptom fatigue malaise afflict majority dialysis population ) , logical binding inactivation endotoxin may lead improved clinical outcome . Unfortunately , product currently approve purpose dialysis patient . One approach problem may augment endogenous system endotoxin inactivation . For example , suggest various serum lipoprotein fraction may fact physiologic `` sink '' endotoxin ( toxin ) via bind surface phospholipid . Therefore , dialysis patient , population characterize hypocholesterolemia hypolipoproteinemia , particularly risk deleterious effect endotoxemia . This lead development `` LIPIDOSE , '' protein-free phospholipid emulsion . The propose mechanism action compound via remodel infused phospholipid lipoprotein , thereby increase lipoprotein phospholipid content facilitate great endotoxin bind neutralization . `` LIPIDOSE '' undergone extensive testing animal human , find significantly increase serum phospholipid lipoprotein concentration , improve survival lethal animal model septic peritonitis , mitigate symptom endotoxemia healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>
