	<brief_summary>Nasal glucocorticosteroids ( GCS ) consider first-line therapy allergic non-allergic rhinitis.1-3 Nasal congestion persist despite maximum treatment intranasal GCS . No drug superior intranasal GCS relieve nasal congestion . For example , antihistamine effective relieve congestion.1 Oral decongestant somewhat beneficial relieve nasal congestion elevate blood pressure , cause restlessness , cause urinary retention . Oxymetazoline , however , potent decongestant addition nasal GCS add considerable decongestant benefit . It may also beneficial patient persistent nighttime congestion despite maximum dosage nasal GCS . Oxymetazoline currently recommend three day use propose risk rhinitis medicamentosa,4 increase nasal congestion cause prolonged use nasal decongestant sprays.5-8 The term RM coin early twentieth century several case report describe patient develop rebound congestion use first generation intranasal decongestant privine hydrochloride ephedrine prolong periods6,7 . The histopathology mechanism RM base animal model may pertinent humans.9-13 Studies use oxymetazoline , new intranasal decongestant , individual without rhinitis show conflict evidence development RM.14-16 For example , normal individual without rhinitis use oxymetazoline three time daily four week develop RM.17 Also , unknown frequency administration dosage oxymetazoline take induce RM whether RM return patient 's baseline nasal congestion present begin oxymetazoline . It also unknown whether RM likely occur old vasoconstrictor privine hydrochloride ephedrine rather oxymetazoline . Nasal GCS reduce amount rebound congestion patient perennial allergic rhinitis reportedly develop RM.18 Nasal GCS decrease nasal mucosa edema , recruitment neutrophil mononuclear cell , cytokine production , late-phase nasal mediators.19-21 They may offer protective benefit risk develop RM . Oxymetazoline may also decrease inferior turbinate hypertrophy thereby permit good adsorption nasal GCS . Hypothesis The addition oxymetazoline nasal GCS fourteen day decrease amount congestion subject allergic non-allergic rhinitis persistent congestion despite maximum recommend dosage nasal GCS . It also hypothesize nasal GCS protect development RM secondary oxymetazoline .</brief_summary>
