	<detailed_description>Amnesia ( lack recall ) one important goal general anesthesia . Inadvertent free recall major surgical procedure inhumane , also predispose patient morbidity post-traumatic stress disorder . Therefore , standard practice among anesthesiologist inquire free ( explicit ) recall post-anesthetic visit . Free recall require functional long term memory . Historically , lack free recall general anesthesia regard complete absence long term memory activity . However , recent evidence suggest relationship general anesthesia memory complex previously think . Objectives propose twofold : ( 1 ) test presence implicit memory two different plane surgical general anesthesia elderly male ( 55-90 year old ) uniform surgical procedure ( urologic procedure via transurethral approach ) ( 2 ) compare pre postoperative anxiety level marker clinical significance operational implicit memory function . The study divide three phase : pre-operative , operative , post-operative . Pre-operative phase consist cognitive function test ( mini-mental state exam ) . This administered urology pre-operative anesthesia clinic visit , obtain informed consent patient . Operative phase start baseline anxiety test ( Spielberg 's state-trait anxiety test ) take operating room . This follow playing audio file ( list speak word ) via headphone general anesthesia surgical procedure . Post-operative phase speak word-stem completion test ( discharge hospital ) repeat anxiety test mention ( 2 3 week post-operatively ) .</detailed_description>
