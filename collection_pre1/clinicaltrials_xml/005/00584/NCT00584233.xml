	<detailed_description>Clinical evaluation : Four hundred woman breast biopsy part standard care ( BIRADS 4 5 ) recruit undergo additional imaging prior biopsy , include ( research ) pre-and post-contrast enhance breast CT imaging breast , well ( standard , FDA approve ) contrast enhance breast MRI . The potential non-contrast enhance breast CT compare use receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) methodology mammography alone , well mammography + tomosynthesis . The breast CT image ( include pre-and post-contrast image ) compare use ROC methodology standard-of-care contrast-enhanced MRI ( include non-contrast contrast image ) . The result clinical trial propose investigation provide strong evidence regard potential breast CT breast cancer screen normal risk high risk population .</detailed_description>
