	<brief_summary>This study determine obese subject direct effect weight loss drug rimonabant ( ie independent weight loss ) energy expenditure , fat metabolism body fat distribution . We hypothesise rimonabant increase energy expenditure . The fuel increase energy expenditure come fat . As result burn fat decrease fat blood improvement body 's response insulin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Rimonabant Energy Expenditure , Fat Metabolism Body Composition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In obese subject ( BMI 33-38kg/m2 ) complete 12 month treatment CB1 antagonist rimonabant ( SR141716 ) average weight loss baseline approximately 8.5 kg . These study also show weight loss accompany decrease plasma triglyceride ( TG ) , increase HDL cholesterol improvement insulin sensitivity measure HOMA-IR . When adjusted weight loss 50 % improvement TG , HDL cholesterol , insulin sensitivity attributable weight loss . This suggest rimonabant direct effect fat metabolism . This study investigate direct effect rimonabant ( ie independent weight loss ) 2 group randomise study . One group receive rimonabant 12 week group dietary intervention match weight loss rimonabant group . Measurements energy expenditure ( use indirect calorimetry Actiheart monitor ) , fatty acid triglyceride metabolism ( use stable isotope technique ) body fat distribution ( magnetic resonance imaging ) make intervention . To determine possible mechanism change metabolism , gene expression key regulator fatty acid metabolism adipose muscle tissue circulating level adipokines measure .</detailed_description>
