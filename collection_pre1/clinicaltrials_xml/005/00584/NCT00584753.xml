	<detailed_description>PET literally molecular image modality . In monitor patient 's response specific chemotherapeutic regime , baseline subsequent PET/CT scan use quantitatively determine therapeutic effect regime , use standard uptake value ( SUV ) , common metric PET imaging . The breast PET/CT system facilitate molecular image breast cancer use number radiolabeled molecule , available commercially ( 18-FDG ) research environment .</detailed_description>
