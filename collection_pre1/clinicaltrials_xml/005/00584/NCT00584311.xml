	<brief_summary>Radiographic imaging play key role manage long-term effect hyperuricemia skeletal system . Two accepted indication prophylactic urate-lowering drug patient hyperuricemia gouty tophi erosion . While much data exist plain radiographic change see patient chronic gout , far less know change see image modality , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ultrasound ( US ) . Further , little data MRI US appearance asymptomatic joint patient hyperuricemia symptomatic gout . There vast emerge data suggest MRI US much sensitive plain radiograph detect early stigma rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Indeed , image device revolutionize treatment RA , early detection skeletal change RA often mandate aggressive therapy . These change would often miss plain radiographs . It hypothesis MR image US detect skeletal change typical gout much sooner would plain radiography . We also hypothesize image technique able detect sign hyperuricemic silent deposition asymptomatic joint patient symptomatic gout joint . As case RA , expect result study would mandate aggressive therapy gout hyperuricemia . Our primary aim proposal would accomplish study patient know gout normal plain radiograph . Each patient would frequently involve joint ( index joint ) analyze MRI US evaluate destructive change ( erosion tophi cortical damage ) . Any sign may portend future joint destruction synovial pannus , bone marrow edema , soft tissue edema , joint effusion also document . In order demonstrate effect hyperuricemic silent deposition , asymptomatic joint patient study use image technique . Any evidence erosion , tophus , synovial pannus , bone marrow soft tissue edema , joint effusion record . By demonstrate destructive , potentially destructive , skeletal change index joint asymptomatic joint significant number patient , show patient leave untreated basis normal plain radiograph likely already skeletal damage .</brief_summary>
