	<brief_summary>The objective study demonstrate NAVI-STAR THERMO-COOL catheter use safely effectively reduce symptomatic episode paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patient frequent ( &gt; 3 episodes/month ) infrequent &lt; 3 episodes/month ) atrial fibrillation resistant least one Class I Class III antiarrhythmic drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The ability saline irrigate catheter deliver RF energy high power lower electrode-tissue interface temperature , combine anatomical guidance electroanatomical mapping allow : 1 . Isolation pulmonary vein LA-PV junction low risk pulmonary vein stenosis ; 2 . Creation continuous , transmural linear leave atrial lesion low risk thromboembolism ; 3 . These two factor eliminate document episode symptomatic sustain AF patient frequent ( &gt; 3 episodes/month ) infrequent ( &lt; 3 episodes/month ) ; 4 . Patients interruption vagal response ( sinus bradycardia AV block ) stimulation sit leave atrial autonomic ganglionated plexi ( GP ) low recurrence atrial fibrillation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age great equal 18 year 2 . At least one documented episode atrial fibrillation ( AF ) within previous 6 month . 3 . Failure least one antiarrhythmic drug ( Class I III ) define recurrence AF adverse effect . 4 . Informed consent obtain . 1 . Left atrial thrombus 2 . Acute myocardial infarction within eight ( 8 ) week 3 . Atriotomy within eight ( 8 ) week 4 . Decompensated heart failure ( unless AF think significant etiologic factor AF ablation clinically indicate ) 5 . Pregnancy 6 . Ablation pulmonary vein within 4 month . 7 . Occurrence perforation ablation procedure perform less two month prior plan ablation date . 8 . Significant congenital anomaly medical problem , opinion investigator , would preclude enrollment study . 9 . Enrolled investigational study evaluate another device drug 10 .
