	<brief_title>Pulmicort Respules Relapse Rates After Treatment ED</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children age 2 8 year inclusive history asthma eligible enrollment present pediatric emergency department asthma exacerbation believe would require admission hospital . All eligible child enrol whenever study personnel available obtain informed write consent . Children le 2 year age enrol wheezing may due bronchiolitis . Children also exclude oral inhale corticosteroid last week , history chronic lung disease ( e.g . cystic fibrosis ) , non-corrected congenital heart disease , pregnant , unavailable follow-up . Initial asthma severity base PEFR 's clinical asthma score ( table 1 ) . If child able reliably provide peak flow emergency department value record calculated percentage predict base standardized height weight chart . All peak flow perform licensed respiratory therapist train registered nurse . If childs effort performance peak flow consider poor respiratory therapist asthma score utilized . If child perform peak flow adequately sent home peak flow meter . All child assign clinical asthma score regardless whether peak flow obtain . With asthma scale score le 7 consider mild , 8 11 moderate score 12 15 severe . This asthma score show good interobserver reliability Pearson correlation statistic 0.92 . Children treat base normal practice pattern ED decision discharge patient attend physician 's discretion . All child receive 2 mg/kg methylprednisolone maximum dose 60 mg orally within first 60 minute treatment 0.6mg/kg oral dexamethasone ( max 15mg ) give Emergency room . When discharge home child give prescription 4 day methylprednisolone dose 1 mg/kg give daily Patients assign double blind fashion budesonide nebule placebo . A computer generate table random number use assign child treatment group . Groups randomize block 10 . A locked area ED contain number plastic bag contain either budesonide nebule identical appear taste placebo nebule . Study personnel patient blind treatment allocation entire length trial . Patients give instruction use dosage ( base weight ) study medication . All patient contact telephone 7 day . They follow 28 day relapse , whichever come first . Relapse define unscheduled physician visit worsen asthma symptom . At time telephone follow-up patient ask symptom well compliance study medication ( see data collection sheet ) . At return visit day 28 ask bring medication determine compliance . At time also peak flow obtain repeat assessment quality life scale . In order measure health-related quality life , Integrated Therapeutics Group Child Asthma Short Form ( ITG-CASF ) complete research assistant upon enrollment , via telephone follow-up 7 day emergency department visit , 28 day follow-up visit . The ITG-CASF previously validate child chronic asthma . Gorelick et al show valid responsive measure health-related quality life child young 2 year age treat emergency department acute asthma . The 8-item ITG Child Asthma Short Form measure follow three concept : Daytime Symptoms , Nighttime Symptoms , Functional Limitations . In addition standard 8-item ITG Child Asthma Short Form , identify two additional item long form ass whether inhaler use interfere child 's life whether adjustment make family life child 's asthma .</detailed_description>
