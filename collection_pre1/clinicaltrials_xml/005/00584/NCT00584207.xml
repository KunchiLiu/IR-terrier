	<brief_summary>This research study conduct evaluate safety effectiveness ablation ( destruction ) uterine leiomyoma ( fibroid ) use electrocautery heating guide ultrasound . We look less invasive method treatment patient uterine fibroid . One method use area body treat mass radiofrequency electrocautery . This method may perform treatment uterine fibroid place small diameter needle wall vagina fibroid guide ultrasound probe . An optional approach place needle skin abdomen fibroid guide ultrasound probe . Once needle fibroid , electrocautery current apply fibroid destroyed heating . This would do hysterectomy ( removal uterus ) . We try test see type treatment apply uterine fibroid . We try develop radiofrequency electrocautery one method treat fibroid without surgery .</brief_summary>
