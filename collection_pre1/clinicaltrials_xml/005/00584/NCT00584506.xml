	<detailed_description>The concept open reduction internal fixation large complex traumatic orbital deformity well establish . It known successful orbital reconstruction hinge upon restoration native orbital volume order establish pre-morbid function avoid long-term complication . To date , facile , reliable , reproducible method measure orbital volume render , despite numerous approach . The objective study assess performance clinical predictive value novel software program design perform complex volumetric analysis application field orbital trauma .</detailed_description>
