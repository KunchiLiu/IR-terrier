	<brief_summary>This study determine optimal treatment patient advanced stage recurrent endometrial cancer . Traditionally , patient treat either hormonal therapy ( megesterol ) chemotherapy ( paclitaxel carboplatin ) . This study investigate effectiveness combination hormonal therapy chemotherapy . This study also examine side-effects associate drug quality life patient combination therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Therapy With Paclitaxel , Carboplatin Megesterol Acetate Management Uterine Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endometrial cancer common gynecologic malignancy 40,100 new case diagnose 6,800 death attributable malignancy 2003 . Most patient diagnosed endometrial cancer early stage disease amenable treatment hysterectomy bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy excellent clinical outcome . Surgical stag improved accuracy clinical stag define low risk population patient favorable long-term outcome surgery alone . However , approximately 15 % patient evidence Stage III IV disease time initial diagnosis 15 % surgical Stage I/II patient recurrent disease . Radiation therapy effective patient disease confine pelvis ; however , patient metastatic disease require systemic therapy order control disease . Multiple chemotherapeutic agent include cisplatin , doxorubicin HCL , paclitaxel , carboplatin , oral etoposide , alone combination , studied persistent , advance recurrent endometrial cancer . A phase III study Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) compare doxorubicin without cisplatin ( GOG 107 ) patient advanced recurrent endometrial cancer . A high response rate ( 45 % vs. 27 % ) note combination therapy consider many standard chemotherapy regimen treatment patient advance endometrial cancer . However , clinical trial continue define optimal chemotherapy regimen disease . Recently , use whole abdominal radiation therapy adjuvant setting advance endometrial cancer demonstrate inferior combination cisplatin doxorubicin . The predicted 2-year survival 70 % patient receive chemotherapeutic regimen superior patient receive radiation therapy ( 59 % ) ( p &lt; 0.01 ) . Hormonal cytotoxic chemotherapy agent utilized patient metastatic recurrent disease amenable radiation therapy . Hormonal agent used disease process since demonstrate hormonal responsive tumor . Notably , correlation histologic grade presence absence hormonal receptor note , well differentiate tumor likely express hormone receptor poor histology . Furthermore , presence estrogen receptor ( ER ) progesterone receptor ( PR ) vary tumor histology . ER report present 70 % 87 % endometrioid adenocarcinoma 0 24 % UPSC ; , PR range 67 % 91 % endometrioid tumor 0 19 % UPSC . Various progestin investigate include Megace ( megesterol acetate ) Provera ( medroxyprogesterone acetate ) treatment endometrial cancer . These agent generally well tolerate report response rate 15-30 % long-term complete response uncommonly experience . Furthermore , median survival patient treat progestin range 9 20 month . As paclitaxel note active ovarian cancer malignancy , seem reasonable evaluate utility endometrial cancer . Accordingly , single agent paclitaxel administer 30 chemotherapy na√Øve patient advance recurrent endometrial cancer . The overall response rate 36 % patient receive 24-hour infusion paclitaxel . Furthermore , paclitaxel give 3-hour infusion demonstrate response 27 37 % patient fail prior chemotherapy . Paclitaxel combine platinum compound , primarily cisplatin several study . A phase II study combine paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 3-hour infusion cisplatin 75 mg/m2 report 67 % response rate . There seven complete response nine partial response 18 month median overall survival . An additional phase II study evaluate efficacy combine paclitaxel carboplatin primary advanced recurrent non-papillary papillary tumor follow radiation . The response rate 78 % patient primary advance non-papillary tumor median disease-free survival 23 month , median overall survival reach time publication . Furthermore , patient recurrent endometrial cancer response rate 56 % , median overall survival 15 month . A phase I study GOG combine paclitaxel , cisplatin , doxorubicin without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor . A 46 % response rate regimen determine optimal dose agent lead phase III GOG study ( GOG 177 ) . GOG 177 demonstrate combination paclitaxel , doxorubicin cisplatin high response rate ( 57 % vs. 33 % ) combination doxorubicin cisplatin , three drug combination associate toxicity 12-month overall survival ( 58 % vs. 50 % ) similar . Furthermore , Grade 3 4 toxicity experience patient receive three drug combination , although statistically significant . Accordingly , phase III trial compare paclitaxel , doxorubicin , cisplatin regimen tolerable regimen paclitaxel carboplatin plan GOG , base equivalency study ovarian cancer patient carboplatin substitute cisplatin demonstrate easy administration equal efficacy less toxicity . The combination hormonal agent cytotoxic chemotherapy also investigate . These study utilize various combination non-taxane base cytotoxic chemotherapy addition megesterol medroxyprogesterone acetate . Patients response rate vary 33 % 60 % , combination cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , cisplatin megesterol produce great response rate . Additionally , Pinelli et al . report 56 % complete partial response rate group patient treat carboplatin sequential hormonal therapy megesterol tamoxifen . These study suggest sequential administration hormonal therapy chemotherapy detrimental effect patient , may beneficial hormonal therapy generally less toxic chemotherapy . Based known tolerability efficacy , investigate combination megesterol acetate paclitaxel carboplatin chemotherapy appear reasonable option set advanced recurrent endometrial cancer . Accordingly , phase II study evaluate combination paclitaxel , carboplatin megesterol acetate treatment advance recurrent adenocarcinoma endometrium .</detailed_description>
