	<detailed_description>Endometrial cancer common gynecologic malignancy United States 40,880 new case diagnose 7,310 death attributable malignancy expect 2005 . The majority patient diagnose endometrial cancer early stage disease amenable treatment hysterectomy bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy excellent clinical outcome . Surgical stag improved accuracy clinical stag define low-risk population patient favorable long-term outcome surgery alone . However , approximately 10-15 % patient surgical stage I endometrial carcinoma ( confine uterus ) invasion outer one-half myometrium ( stage IC ) moderately poorly differentiate tumor ( grade 2 3 ) . These patient high risk recurrence ( approximately 20-25 % recurrence rate 5 year ) . This patient population historically consider `` intermediate-risk '' recurrence low risk patient disease spread beyond uterus , high risk patient grade 1 tumor minimally invasive ( Stage IA IB ) . The optimal mode postoperative management population patient yet define . Historically , radiation therapy use form patient diagnose intermediate-risk endometrial cancer . Two randomized trial publish last 5 year evaluate use adjuvant radiation therapy patient intermediate-risk endometrial adenocarcinoma . Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) study use adjuvant whole pelvic radiation ( WPRT ) versus adjuvant therapy ( NAT ) patient stage IB , IC , II ( occult ) endometrial adenocarcinoma . In study 392 patient , use WPRT substantial impact local recurrence ( 18 NAT versus 3 WPRT ) , impact risk distant recurrence ( 18 NAT versus 11 WPRT ) . Because lack distant control , use WPRT impact overall survival ( estimate 4 year survival 86 % NAT versus 92 % WPRT , p=0.557 ) . The PORTEC trial randomize patient intermediate-risk Stage I endometrial carcinoma WPRT versus NAT . Of note , patient trial surgically stag . Of 714 patient median follow-up 52 month , local recurrence rate 4 % WPRT group versus 14 % control group ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . The use WPRT impact 5-year overall survival ( 81 % WPRT versus 85 % NAT ) . Furthermore , clinician advocate observation surgical staging radiation therapy reserve patient recur locally . Several report report salvage rate 50-66 % patient local recurrence . Given approximately 20-25 % patient population recur locally , many clinician prefer use local radiation therapy salvage therapy , thus spar majority patient potential long-term effect pelvic radiation therapy . Given radiation therapy affect distant metastasis carry significant long-term morbidity , therapy necessary improve disease-free survival setting . Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy one potential option patient since may sterilize local distant metastasis . The use adjuvant chemotherapy may desirable radiation therapy side effect chemotherapy short-term subside therapy complete discontinue . Multiple chemotherapeutic agent include cisplatin , doxorubicin HCL , paclitaxel , carboplatin , oral etoposide study patient advanced recurrent endometrial cancer . A phase III study Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) compare doxorubicin without cisplatin ( GOG 107 ) patient advanced recurrent endometrial cancer . A high response rate ( 42 % vs. 25 % ) note combination therapy consider many standard chemotherapy regimen treatment patient advance endometrial cancer . Paclitaxel also study single agent combination platinum compound set . A phase II study combine paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 3-hour infusion cisplatin 75 mg/m2 report 67 % response rate . There seven complete response nine partial response 18-month median overall survival . An additional phase II study evaluate efficacy combine paclitaxel carboplatin primary recurrent non-papillary papillary tumor follow radiation therapy . response rate 78 % patient primary advance non-papillary tumor median disease-free survival 23 month , median overall survival 15 month . Currently , many clinician use combination paclitaxel , doxorubicin , cisplatin ( TAP ) , base phase III GOG study demonstrate significantly high response rate ( 57 % vs. 33 % ) combination doxorubicin cisplatin ( AP ) , also survival advantage ( median , 15.3 vs. 12.3 month ; P=.037 ) . Significantly neurotoxicity experience patient TAP arm . Currently , GOG evaluate TAP combination versus tolerable regimen paclitaxel carboplatin phase III setting . The combination paclitaxel carboplatin consider standard care high-risk early stage ovarian cancer advance ovarian cancer . The safety combination well establish number phase III trial currently use primary setting patient ovarian cancer advance endometrial cancer . Although combination consider active endometrial carcinoma , paucity data regard use adjuvant chemotherapy set intermediate-risk endometrial adenocarcinoma . Accordingly , phase II study evaluate combination paclitaxel carboplatin adjuvant therapy patient early stage adenocarcinoma endometrium elevated-risk recurrence .</detailed_description>
