	<brief_summary>Autism complex neurodevelopmental disorder think involve interaction multiple variable susceptibility gene , environmental factor , epigenetic effect . Great concern raise marked increase prevalence autism spectrum disorder last decade . Risperidone , study atypical antipsychotic use child , show improve severe behavioral difficulty half child autism difficulty . However , child autism severe behavioral problem respond risperidone , , significant side effect . Two controlled study numerous open-label long term study child autism spectrum disorder use atypical antipsychotic risperidone show significant decrease associate serious behavioral problem . The use atypical antipsychotic great concern , however , significant side effect fact two-thirds child positively respond . Ways predict response , appropriate dosage serious side effect need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For study , identify 40 child ( 4 18 year old ) autism also serious behavioral problem . We treat risperidone . Blood sample obtain prior treatment eight week treatment study exit . At time , efficacy assess use Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale ( CGI-I ) Irritability subscale Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) . Blood genomic profile risperidone treatment determine use Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays combine RT-PCR . Blood genomic profile show predict medication response disorder cancer epilepsy . This exploratory discovery study use blood genomic profile risperidone treatment child autism severe behavioral difficulty determine profile predict response treatment . The ultimate goal line research develop method predict medication work child initiate treatment , predict child might develop particular side effect , identify new treatment target future medication development . Risperidone start 0.5 mg bedtime 4 day , current dosage tolerate evidenced mild sedation , EPS moderate severe AEs , continue behavioral symptom , dose increase 1 mg bedtime additional 4 day . If tolerate indicate , 0.5 mg add AM daily total 1.5 mg. After , dosage may increase appear adequate clinical response . Dosage increase side effect ( e.g . excessive sedation , salivation , EPS , lactation ) may decrease tolerate . If investigator determines significant adverse reaction occur subject family want stop study , medication taper stop depend dose reason stop subject offer alternative treatment M.I.N.D . Institute Clinic refer elsewhere . This dose schedule mirror use two recent positive trial risperidone treat severe behavioral problem autism ( McCracken et al. , 2002 ; Shea et al. , 2004 ) .</detailed_description>
