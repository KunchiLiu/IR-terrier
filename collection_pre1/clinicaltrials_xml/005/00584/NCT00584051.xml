	<brief_summary>Asthma inflammatory condition airway lungs result obstruction airflow condition . The disease continue major worldwide health care problem prevalence continue increase annually . In 2005 , 20 million people diagnosed asthma . The disease cause significant morbidity account 5,000 death annually . Between 1980 1994 prevalence asthma increase 74 % United States , child age 5 , prevalence increase 160 % . The allergic etiology airway inflammation associate asthma establish . Bronchial washing asthmatic subject often characterize eosinophil , mast cell , cytokine associate Th2 ( allergic ) phenotype . Similarly , IgE play pivotal role airway inflammation asthmatic subject allergens cross-link IgE bound mast cell airways cause release histamine inflammatory mediator . The association asthma IgE mediate allergic phenotype well establish 70 % asthmatic also suffer allergic disease . Adequately treated asthma often minimal impact quality life diagnosis proper treatment often delay , result increase missed school day , emergency room visit , otherwise preventable degradation quality life . It would therefore highly useful identify biomarker use assist diagnosis asthma identify subject high risk develop allergic disease asthma future . Efforts identify genetic marker early diagnosis asthma unsuccessful , mainly due complexity pathogenesis disease . Atrial natriuretic factor pro-hormone precursor 4 natriuretic peptide hormone include atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) . ANP 's effect cardiovascular system well characterize . Less well understood role hormone play immune regulation . Recent study demonstrate role ANP regulation immune function : ANP induce release histamine mast cell macrophage , stimulate migration neutrophil , enhances cytotoxic activity natural killer ( NK ) cell , stimulate TNF-Î² production . Human dendritic cell express ANP receptor ( GC-a ) polarize CD4+ cell towards Th2 phenotype . Since allergic rhinitis asthma associate Th2 phenotype , possible elevated level ANP use predict asthma severity predict future predilection atopic disease . There number ANP gene polymorphism study found associate renal disease , heart disease , hypertension diabetes . Several study investigate potential role polymorphism cardiovascular disease find association polymorphism ANP gene leave ventricular remodeling , hypertension , renal disease , diabetes , increase risk ischemic stroke . To knowledge , study evaluate role ANP polymorphisms allergic disease perform . The goal research proposal evaluate whether ANP level utilized assist diagnosis asthma prediction asthma severity . Additionally , investigate potential effect polymorphism ANP gene asthma severity thus serve useful genetic marker predict future risk atopy asthma .</brief_summary>
