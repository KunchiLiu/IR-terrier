	<detailed_description>Our group develop interdisciplinary expertise biomarkers related distinct aspect inflammation-induced joint damage , notably associate degradation component extracellular matrix , bone loss , associate post-translational change protease inhibitor . The objective group project collect SF pair serum carry preclinical study evaluate , alone combination testing , potential novel biomarkers prevalence diagnostic/prognostic value patient arthritis , determine therapeutic intervention regulate level . More specifically , study ( 1 ) biomarkers associate osteoclastic bone resorption synthesis/degradation cartilage , ( 2 ) inhibitor enzymes ( calpastatin ) preferentially target rheumatoid patient , well ( 3 ) enzyme ( e.g . Matrix Metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) ) responsible cleavage component articular cartilage . Finally , propose characterize repertoire specific active protease SF arthritic patient concomitantly use biomarkers ( neoepitopes cleave collagen ) previously associate cartilage destruction synthesis identify new target development protease inhibitor treatment arthritis . Furthermore , project also provide opportunity test potential measure net proteolytic activity Fluorescent-Activated Substrate Conversion method monitor disease activity treatment efficiency clinical setting .</detailed_description>
