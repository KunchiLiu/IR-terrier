	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving temozolomide together bortezomib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : To determine best dose bortezomib temozolomide see well work treat patient advanced refractory solid tumor melanoma .</brief_summary>
