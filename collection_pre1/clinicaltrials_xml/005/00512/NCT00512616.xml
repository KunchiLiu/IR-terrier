	<brief_summary>This study examine Ceftriaxone , antibiotic , improve symptom depression Bipolar Disorder . Purpose : This study examine whether drug ceftriaxone help patient bipolar depression short-term treatment symptom depress mood , psychomotor retardation ( slow think movement ) , problem sleep . Recent study suggest abnormality brain level chemical glutamate may involve cause depression . Ceftriaxone increase protein brain call GLT1 , responsible regulate brain level glutamate . People 18 65 year age bipolar disorder currently depressive episode least 4 week longer 12 month duration may eligible study . Participants admit NIH Clinical Center 10 week . During first 1 2 week , evaluate tapered antidepressant mood stabilizer take . They remain free medication 2 week randomly assign take either ceftriaxone placebo 6 week . The study drug give intravenously ( vein ) every day . To minimize discomfort , patient give PICC line - tube insert vein arm remain duration drug treatment . This prevents need repeat intravenous injection . Patients physical examination begin end study two electrocardiogram ( ECG ) study . They evaluate periodically series psychiatric rating scale determine effect study drug mood think periodic blood test assess health status . In addition , patient ask undergo lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) twice study collect sample cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF , fluid bathe brain spinal cord ) . The CSF examine try understand brain chemical related depression effect ceftriaxone . A local anesthetic give needle inserted space bone low back CSF circulate spinal cord . A small amount fluid collect needle . This test optional . At end study patient offer free treatment 3 month standard medication bipolar depression referral community physician long-term treatment make .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Glutamate Transporter GLT1 , Treatment Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar affective disorder ( BPD , manic-depressive illness ) common , severe , chronic often life-threatening illness . Increasingly , recognize depressive phase illness , contribute much morbidity mortality . To date , available somatic treatment proven effective acute phase bipolar depression . Thus , clear need develop novel improve therapeutic bipolar depression . Recent preclinical study suggest antidepressant may exert delayed indirect effect glutamatergic system . Clinical data suggest glutamatergic modulators may antidepressant effect human . We first test glutamatergic modulator riluzole , inhibitor glutamate release enhancer glutamate reuptake astrocytes find antidepressant property patient treatment-resistant major depression bipolar depression . In recent study , find single intravenous dose non-competitive NMDA antagonist ketamine produce rapid relatively sustained antidepressant effect patient treatment-resistant major depression . A recent report find Beta-lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone increase uptake glutamate via increase GLT1 function ( Rothstein et al 2005 ) antidepressant-like effect animal model ( Mineur et al 2006 ) . Together , data suggest glutamatergic system may play role pathophysiology treatment depression , agent directly reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission may represent novel class antidepressant . We propose expand previous finding efficacy glutamatergic modulators patient unipolar bipolar depression test specific , new mechanism use ceftriaxone chronically increase expression glutamate transporter GLT1 order facilitate removal glutamate synaptic cleft effort reduce excessive glutamate transmission result produce acute antidepressant effect . The model present clinical testable one , one , successful , hold potential develop group novel pharmacological treatment major depression . Patients , age 18 65 , diagnosis bipolar depression ( without psychotic feature ) , randomize double-blind treatment receive either ceftriaxone ( 1-4 g/day ) placebo intravenously period 6 week . Acute efficacy determine demonstrate great response rate use specify criterion . Approximately 86 patient bipolar depression enrol study .</detailed_description>
