We use validated Asthma Control Questionnaire measure control baseline , three six month , compare improvement two group . We also assess confident people feel control asthma , use validated measure self-efficacy , attitude knowledge .

	<brief_title>Mobile Phone Based Structured Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A. Hypothesis In teenager adult poorly control asthma offer treatment accord BTS-SIGN guideline , use mobile phone-based lung function symptom monitoring patient feedback improve asthma control achieve patient self-efficacy six-months compare usual paper-based monitoring strategy . B . Background Despite effective treatment , study continue demonstrate asthma poorly controlled,1,2 though marked variation control achieve UK general practice suggest improvement possible vast majority patients.3 Psychosocial factor denial illness , low outcome expectation 4,5 hectic lifestyle , exacerbate limited knowledge , poor self-recognition symptom discordant attitude , influence patient ' ability engage self-management resultant poor concordance monitoring treatment.6,7 Interventions involve biofeedback address barrier objectively demonstrate symptom severity impact medication compliance.8 A Cochrane review demonstrate self-management education link structure care improve asthma outcomes.9 Despite self-management education,6 real life , compliance traditional diary monitoring low 6 % ,10 result often fabricated.11 Electronic recording may improve compliance,12 two-thirds potential reading record 72-week trial.13 Increasingly pervasive throughout society , mobile phone technology provide convenient , portable communication medium . Mobile phone-based monitoring support biofeedback , appear able engage patient management , result high level adherence patient acceptability,13,14 many patient welcome innovative care.15,16,17,18 Integrated within structure care protocol , potential address barrier poor adherence low expectation thereby improve patient outcomes . Monitoring , , intervention alters behaviour . The theoretical model develop Glasziou et al . describes complementary evolve role periodic professional review on-going patient self-monitoring.19 The monitoring asthma lung function and/or symptom cite well-defined exemplar concept . Our recent qualitative study suggest people asthma perceive role mobile technology aid transition clinician-supported phase control gain , effective self-management maintenance phases.20 This approach resonate two key health service policy : drive technological solution healthcare problem ; 21 importance expert patient self-management long-term conditions.22,23 Our propose trial test hypothesis engage patient self-monitoring timely biofeedback , mobile phone technology improve asthma control achieve six month compare usual paper-based monitoring . Our multi-disciplinary team extensive experience tele-care , delivery primary care respiratory service , patient self-management , research within general practice setting . Building extensive background work,3,13-15,17,18,20 offer expertise respiratory health service research , social science ideally place undertake trial . Description mobile phone-based monitoring system ( see figure ) The system software ( T+ asthma , Oxford , UK ) load onto web-enabled mobile phone . It permit record symptom , medication usage lung function . Measurements make Piko meter ( prescribable electronic meter record ( FEV1 ) peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) ) . We opt record FEV1 component ACQ,24 correlation Piko spirometry FEV1 excellent ( r=0.98 ) .25,26 Data transmit remote server analyse late reading return mobile phone , compare precede week 's recording prompt use 'preventer ' medication . In addition , patient clinician access record via password-protected website.C . Design research A six month single-blinded randomised control trial Practice recruitment Six/eight practice ( total list 72,000 patient ) recruit Leicester area ( local practice lead co-applicant ) . Eligible practice asthma-trained nurse able commit additional clinical workload . Participant recruitment Practices use Minimal Asthma Assessment Tool ( MAAT ) , interrogate routinely collect data computer database , use pattern medication usage , symptom control biometric data identify patient ( 12 year ) poorly control asthma.3 Potential eligibility confirm inspection manual/computer record check ( document ) exclusion criterion : significant lung disease , specialist care severe/difficult asthma , unable communicate English use mobile phone request GP significant social/clinical problem . The practice invite potentially eligible patient post participate . Confirmation eligibility baseline assessment Potential participant attend screen assessment ( normally practice ) eligibility confirm , current asthma control assess use ACQ,24 suitability mobile phone establish . All patient poorly control asthma ( define ACQ &gt; 1.5 27 ) enter trial baseline assessment undertaken . ( see summary table ) Randomisation Patients allocate , use centralise randomisation stratify practice , mobile phone paper-based monitoring . The University Aberdeen 's Health Services Research Unit provide 24hr telephone randomisation service . Intervention group : Mobile phone base monitoring Patients intervention group issue Piko meter T+ software load onto mobile phone . They ask monitor symptom , medication usage FEV1 twice day submit reading . The web-record available patient asthma nurse aid assessment control routine review , patient ' GP event unscheduled asthma consultation . Control group : paper-based monitoring Patients control group issue Piko meter , ask keep paper diary , record symptom , medication usage FEV1 reading twice day . Clinical care self-management education group Structured care provide practice ' asthma nurse ( ) , trained aspect trial . Clinical care group accordance step-wise approach BTS-SIGN Guideline.28 Patients review monthly control achieve judged nurse basis clinical monitoring . All patient receive one-to-one standardise asthma education session , include information asthma , asthma treatment , inhaler technique , monitor seek urgent assistance .</detailed_description>
