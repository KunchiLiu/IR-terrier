	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess effect Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation ( NMES ) associate isokinetic training program young healthy men woman . Twenty subject ( 10 men , 10 woman ; 21±1.5 year ) submit quadriceps femoris muscle strengthen program ( 3 set 10 isokinetic concentric repetition 30°/s ) two day per week 4 week . One limb submit strength training ( EX ) underwent train program NMES add contraction ( Ex+NMES ) . The current use NMES Russian Current ( frequency 2500 Hz , 50 bursts/s pulse duration 200 µs ) . The evaluation protocol include isometric isokinetic concentric extensor torques 30°/s . Men increase torque test modality limbs , difference . The angle peak torque increase EX limb , show altered tension-length relationship , occur Ex+NMES limb woman . Women increase torque EX limb modality , occur isometric mode Ex+NMES limb . However , show decrease acceleration time Ex+NMES limb , show could produce muscular contraction readily train . The result study find association NMES isokinetic concentric voluntary strength training improve strength gain voluntary training young healthy subject gender . However , could improve neuromuscular readiness produce torque woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects Twenty active healthy undergraduate student ( men : 21 ± 1.9 year ; 1.77 ± 0.1 ; 73 ± 8.4 kg ; 23.3 ± 1.4 kg/m² ; woman : 20.9 ± 0.7 year ; 1.64 ± 0.1 ; 56.3 ± 5.5 kg ; 21 ± 1.0 kg/m² ) select study . All underwent physical examination study already participate strength training program study . All 10 men select conclude study . Although 15 woman select begin train program , 5 exclude : 3 report episode pain knee joint training session , 2 could conclude train program personal reason . Therefore , final data refers 10 woman . All procedure evaluation train explain consent term sign . The project approve Ethics Committee Medical Research Federal University São Carlos agreement Declaration Helsinki . Evaluation protocol Before evaluation , subject familiarize test training procedure . All evaluation training procedure apply right left limbs subject train program . To avoid possible dominance effect , volunteer randomly separate determine limb ( right left ) training would associate NMES . The investigator make data analysis blind randomization . After 5 min period warm-up stationary bicycle speed 20 km/h load 20 W , subject stretched quadriceps femoris hamstring muscle limbs . Each muscle group stretch 3 time 30 alternately . Afterwards , subject position isokinetic dynamometer ( Biodex® Multi-joint System 3 , Biodex , Shirley , NY ) , angulation 100º hip . Trunk , pelvis , thigh subject stabilize strip , follow equipment description36 . Rotation axis dynamometer align axis knee , level lateral epicondyle femur , attachment fix distal part leg subject , 5 cm medial malleolus . The gravity effect correction calculate limb 60° flexion . The isokinetic device calibrate evaluation training session request manufacturer . After , volunteer knee position 60° familiarized action would . After , ask perform 3 maximum voluntary isometric knee extension contraction 5 , 1 min rest interval contraction . Three min last contraction , subject familiarize isokinetic contraction perform 5 maximum isokinetic concentric knee extension contraction 30º/s speed , 90° 15° , 0° full extension , total 75° Range Motion ( ROM ) . Verbal encouragement37 well visual feedback equipment38 give attempt achieve maximal voluntary effort level contraction subject ask perform . The procedure repeat contralateral limb .</detailed_description>
