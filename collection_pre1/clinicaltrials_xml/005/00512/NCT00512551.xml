	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find expression certain gene link response cervical cancer radiation . Researchers study large number gene locate tumor material learn information .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DNA Array Analysis Patients With Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients study already schedule begin radiation therapy . Researchers get tumor cell take two biopsy cervix . The first biopsy cervical tumor do treatment give . The second biopsy perform 48 hour radiation treatment begin . They study cell lab new technique study gene expression call DNA array , well HPV analysis , quantification apoptosis level , hematoxylin eosin staining , storage tissue future research.. The pattern gene expression biopsy compare success radiation treatment . Some material also store used future research project . This investigational study . A total 18 patient take part study . All enrol UTMDACC .</detailed_description>
