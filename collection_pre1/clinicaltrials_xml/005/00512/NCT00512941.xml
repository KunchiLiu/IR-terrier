	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis virus B ( HVB ) and/or virus C ( HVC ) major public-health problem since present long phase clinical latency make early diagnosis difficult result development large number case complication cirrhosis , hepatic insufficiency hepatocarcinoma . In Brazil , estimate number HVB patient two million , 72 thousand report . As regard HVC , ratio three million estimate case 52 thousand report . Learning serological profile user viral hepatitis reference service essential planning diagnostic therapeutic action ; therefore , objective study . Five hundred thirty-one HVB HVC serological profile patient refer SAE/HD within period 18 month ( January 2006 June 2007 ) study mean retrospective analysis . The patient classify : ) HBV : carrier , cure , isolate anti-HBc vaccinated ; b ) HVC : reagent anti-HVC ; c ) HBV/HVC co-infection : AgHBs reagent anti-HVC ; ) Susceptible : non-reagent serology . As regard HBV , follow find total number patient : carrier , 12.6 % ; cure , 18.9 % ; isolate anti-HBc , 9.0 % vaccinate , 6.2 % . The patient reagent anti-HVC comprise 31.3 % total number individual . HBV/HCV co-infection 0.6 % . Susceptible individual comprise 20.5 % . It conclude approximately 45 % refer patient carry chronic infection B and/or C virus , condition require additional investigation , many instance , specific treatment . Strategies early diagnosis essential order prevent intrinsic complication condition .</detailed_description>
