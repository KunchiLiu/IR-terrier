	<brief_summary>Diseases airway ( bronchus ) lung include asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , lead cause reduce quality life , loss work , hospital admission death result major economic burden patient society . Worsening ( exacerbation ) condition common frequently due viral bacterial infection , cause inflammation bronchus , i.e . bronchitis . Ways objectively measure inflammation need improve diagnosis , cause severity guide treatment . The investigator also need understand change body 's defense ( immune ) mechanism make patient frequent infective bronchitis . At present , sputum cell count able identify different type bronchitis , severity may able differentiate viral bacterial infection . Other measurement sputum , exhale breath , blood urine also available measure inflammation . Measurement immune cell blood give u idea work capacity immune system body . The investigator plan study patient asthma COPD time worsen condition identify , 1 . To extent viral bacterial bronchitis diagnose test inflammation ? 2 . How clearing infection relate clear inflammation ? 3 . What change body 's defense mechanism make patient prone frequent infective bronchitis ? 4 . How measurement sputum , exhale breath , blood urine relate viral bacterial bronchitis ? 5 . What differences measurement sputum , exhale breath , blood urine asthma COPD ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Exacerbations asthma COPD major cause morbidity , mortality economic burden patient society . Exacerbations usually associate worsen airway inflammation , identify quantitative sputum cell count , neutrophilic , eosinophilic , combine eosinophilic neutrophilic neither , result different cause . The common cause exacerbation infection . Neutrophilic exacerbation common usually associate bacterial non-bacterial infection eosinophilic exacerbation might also predict viral infection . However investigator still unsure whether aspect neutrophilic inflammation differentiate viral bacterial infection . Also exact relationship etiology , mechanisms susceptibility infection , inflammation airway responsiveness exacerbation poorly understood . As result , physician assumes clinical improvement exacerbation correspond resolution infection underlie inflammation airway time . However , inflammation airway may persist beyond resolution infection , may contribute morbidity mortality disease . The primary objective study well understand correlation different type inflammation infection airways exacerbation . Secondary objective understand susceptibility infection method assess inflammatory response airway responsiveness infection . To attain objective compare total cell , percentage neutrophil , percentage eosinophil sputum nasal secretion , sputum fibrinogen , sputum total lactate dehydrogenase , microbial load sputum nasal secretion , exhale nitric oxide , p H exhale breath condensate , serum procalcitonin , intensity urinary 3-bromotyrosine , 3-chlorotyrosine , 3 , 5- dibromotyrosine dityrosine , symptom score , FEV1 Mannitol PD15 different time point exacerbation , compare activity toll like receptor ( 2,4,7,9 ) natural killer T cell stable phase disease number infective exacerbation course one year test feasibility mannitol challenge test method induce sputum measure airway hyperresponsiveness . Our approach identify 100 patient variable ( asthma ) chronic airflow limitation ( COPD ) , report within 2 5 day onset exacerbation course one year . The clinical , physiological , inflammatory , microbiological immunological parameter assess day presentation ( day 0 ) , day 7 , 14 6 8 week . The information collect 6 8 week serve baseline data , patient clinically stable point time . If patient next exacerbation course trial , procedure follow . This work enhance knowledge issue need improve diagnosis exacerbation airways disease , cause , mechanism involve appropriate treatment . The result may lead future randomize controlled trial , treatment exacerbation base appropriate measurement eventually lead well management airway disease , reduce overall cost therapy improve quality life patient .</detailed_description>
