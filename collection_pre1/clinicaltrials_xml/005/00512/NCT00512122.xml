	<detailed_description>Written inform consent obtain patient close family member legal guardian . The family member patient withdraw trial , time , without impact treatment penalty . The investigator confirm study concern condition directly threaten patient health adult patient able give consent suffers condition . The experiment essential confirm result earlier research patient could consent research method . On admission patient randomly assign receive EN combine early PN EN . At ICU admission , consecutive patient randomly assign one two treatment group use blinded envelope , stratify accord primary diagnostic category admission . Upon addition new study site , number en seal envelope randomization stratify accord primary diagnostic category admission replace identical digital system allow central randomization . As initial nutritional support , patient randomise 'EN combine early PN ' group receive glucose 20 % 40 ml/hr . EN initiate even second ICU hospitalisation day , PN start morning third ICU hospitalisation day . The amount PN give particular day difference calculate caloric need calorie deliver EN previous 24 hour . When EN cover 80 % calculated caloric need PN stop . When patient able eat , parenteral regimen reduce eventually stop . Whenever oral ( + enteral ) intake 50 % calculated caloric need , PN ( ) -started . As initial nutritional support , patient randomise 'EN ' group receive glucose 5 % 40 ml/hr . EN initiate even second ICU day . From morning third ICU hospitalisation day , amount glucose 5 % give volume PN patient theoretically would require receive 100 % presumed caloric need base amount EN deliver previous 24 hour . When patient able eat , parenteral regimen ( glucose 5 % ) reduce 50 % eventually stop . Whenever oral ( + enteral ) intake 50 % calculated caloric need , PN ( glucose 5 % ) ( ) -started . If patient would need stay seven day ICU enteral feeding least 80 % calculated calorie possible , switch EN PN day eight . Common strategy attempt early enteral nutrition study arm : EN initiate even second ICU day , unless patient able eat . The increase enteral feeding volume adaptation regimen pathological condition accord protocol . Trace element , mineral vitamin administer daily intravenously ( IV ) patient day admission onwards . IV substitution stop patient receive least 1500 ml EN . All patient treat follow intensive insulin therapy schedule - target blood glucose level 80 - 110 mg/dl - admission discharge oral feeding . Patients wean ventilator accord standard protocol . End-of-care decision patient intensive care consider futile take consensus group two senior ICU physician refer specialist , blind study treatment allocation . In subgroup patient , pathway inflammation metabolism endocrinological impact intervention study blood sample snap-frozen vivo biopsy muscle adipose tissue . Blood tissue sample healthy volunteer serve reference exploratory study . In patient , radiological evolution regional muscle adipose tissue volume evaluate .</detailed_description>
