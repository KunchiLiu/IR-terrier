	<brief_summary>The use computer-assisted surgery orthopedic surgeon experience performance total knee arthroplasty may result good overall limb implant alignment few outlier compare finding manual total knee arthroplasty . The alignment result previous study base radiographic measurement . The sensitivity radiographic assessment limb implant alignment may significant enough distinguish small difference computer-assisted surgery manual technique . It possible alignment difference minor expose standard radiograph might result long-term difference durability arthroplasty perform use computer-assisted surgery manual technique . Moreover possible measure additional implant position parameter compute tomography ( CT ) technology . In study , investigator would like add new method , accurate measurement implant alignment correlate result clinical data .</brief_summary>
