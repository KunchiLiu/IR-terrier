	<brief_summary>Despite intensive research effort , still simple effective screening tool detect early lung cancer . The majority newly diagnose patient higher stage , often disseminate , non-resectable disease . A good understanding natural biology molecular abnormality early lung lesion may aid development effective screening tool . This study investigate effectiveness bronchoscopy white light ( WL ) alone combination Lung Imaging Fluorescence Endoscopy ( LIFE ) detection early lung lesion patient high risk develop lung cancer . LIFE FDA approve adjunct WL bronchoscopy screen lung cancer study provide standardize set direct comparison combination WL LIFE versus traditional WL bronchoscopy make . In addition , study set stage collection unique set biopsy specimen use learn natural biology molecular change early lung lesion . We study abnormality p53 immunohistochemistry molecular analysis . The p53 result compare histological grade genomic instability . Measures genomic instability loss chromosomal information cellular aneuploidy . Recent advance molecular pathology , development Laser Capture Microdissection ( LCM ) , make molecular profiling extremely small lesion feasible . The information obtain technique use comparison clinical exposure information . Future plan include culture bronchial epithelial cell study genomic instability multistep process cancer progression . It hope application new technology improve early detection human lung cancer provide insight natural biology molecular change early lung lesion may progress towards overt cancer .</brief_summary>
