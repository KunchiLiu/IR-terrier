	<brief_title>Screening Lung Cancer Current Past Smokers With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To show proportion lung cancer diagnose stage I II significantly great surveillance arm control arm . Secondary - Establish whether sputum cytology and/or cytometry employed stratify patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) accord risk develop incidence lung cancer . - Identify patient pre-invasive lesion airways examine risk develop lung cancer patient harbor lesion . - Provide opportunity archive blood sample patient surveillance enable identification marker disease progression . - Examine compliance regular screening among patient high-risk group . - Determine proportion patient possible provide sputum screen result . OUTLINE : This randomize , control , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord recruit site , age , gender , smoke history ( current v ex-smoker ) severity chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) ( mild v moderate ) . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . - Control arm : Patients manage accord usual practice hospital general practice COPD treatment . They undergo particular investigation except may arise due change clinical condition . Those patient diagnose lung cancer course study offer chest x-ray 5 year follow-up . - Surveillance arm : Patients undergo surveillance 5 year . A sputum sample collect cytology cytometry . If sputum sample normal patient ask provide sputum sample annually . If sputum sample abnormal patient undergoes annual spiral CT scan follow autofluorescence bronchoscopy . At bronchoscopy , follow sample take : bronchial washing , bronchial brushing , bronchial biopsy . Bronchoscopy repeat every 4-12 month depend upon histology result . If invasive lesion find , patient refer treatment via normal hospital system . Any remain sputum sample store frozen part tissue bank associate trial .
