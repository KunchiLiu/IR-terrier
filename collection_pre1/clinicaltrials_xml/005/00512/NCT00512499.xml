	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis frequent easily treatable disease . Rates treatment affect patient low , high risk patient initiate treatment minority pursue treatment long enough time prevent fracture . Patients present fragility fracture 50 year age high risk osteoporosis may represent ideal group patient intervention aim improve initiation persistence treatment effective . Our first hypothesis availability dedicate nurse practitioner identify patient fragility fracture among patient present fracture clinic orthopedic surgeon increase markedly rate identification osteoporosis . Our second hypothesis give patient primary health practitioner ( PHP ) patient 's clinical , biological radiological data along individualized care suggestion yield significantly good result give patient PHP generic information osteoporosis risk , investigation treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>3- The OPTIMUS INTERVENTIONS 3.1 . PROGRAM GOALS OBJECTIVES The OPTIMUS program health intervention whose aim increase rate long-term treatment osteoporosis patient incident fragility fracture address initiation treatment persistence treatment . Participation program voluntary . Specifically , goal OPTIMUS : 1 . To increase rate initiation treatment osteoporosis follow fragility fracture patient present CHUS . This rate currently 30 % Province Quebec , accord Recognizing Osteoporosis Consequences Quebec ( ROCQ ) survey . We hope demonstrate coordinate approach combine successful identification patient fragility fracture evaluate CHUS , quality information patient family physician , rapid appropriate management initiation treatment ( see ) patient general practitioner lead appropriate level treatment osteoporosis episode fracture . Our objective initiate treatment within 8 month fracture least 50 % patient accept participate Minimal Intervention , 75 % Intensive Intervention , 90 % Immediate treatment . The specific Intervention detail . 2 . Improve long-term adherence treatment osteoporosis follow initiation treatment fragility fracture . The current rate persistence 30-50 % 1 year , loss persistence occur first month . Initiating treatment osteoporosis important . However , long-term adherence treatment osteoporosis poor , discontinuation erratic intake medication observe first month . Our objective maintain observance ( i.e . intake least 80 % dos drug accord patient questionnaire delivery drug pharmacist ) one year least 80 % patient initiated treatment . To end , also evaluate whether disclosure result measurement blood marker bone metabolism influence patient adherence treatment time . The correlation measurement result phone follow interview drug delivery pharmacists indicator adherence also determine . Our objective Intensive Immediate treatment Interventions imply 60 % patient fragility fracture would treat least 16 month ( i.e . 80 % 75 % patient initiated treatment adhere long-term ) . After 16 month treatment , rate loss adherence likely low , information lacking subject . We partially address question follow patient 2 year . Longer rate adherence need ascertain , represent objective part current proposal . Why set objective 60 % long-term adherence treatment ? Our objective treat 60 % patient may appear quite low . However , significantly high appal 20-30 % rate initiation treatment currently see province Quebec Canada general , combine 30-50 % long-term adherence observe practice ( translate currently 5-20 % patient take appropriate long-term treatment osteoporosis ) . If successful , rate treatment increase 3 10 time . On contrary , objective treat 60 % patient may appear unrealistic . To attain goal , include health practitioner involve patient ' care ( e.g. , family physician , orthopedist , pharmacist , patient ) , well test additional safety net ensure adherence , include patient ' recall nurse coordinator , estimate impact add result serum marker bone metabolism , allow problematic patient ( i.e . patient hip fracture , without family physician , complex medical situation , adhere despite measure ) possibility obtain consultation bone specialist . Effect fracture rate If objective treat 60 % patient attain , likely translate significant reduction close 50 % vertebral fracture ( decrease 80-90 % risk recurrent vertebral fracture bisphosphonates 60 % population ) close 30 % non-vertebral fracture , include hip ( reduction 50 % risk bisphosphonate use 60 % population ) . These fracture associate morbidity ( chronic pain , invalidity ) increase mortality , contribute increase cost public Health Care System ( hospitalization , surgery , rehabilitation , short- , mid- long-term care nurse home need ) . However , impact fracture become evaluable access Quebec 's Health Insurance Agency ( RAMQ ) databases ( regional Health Agency ) , compare rate new fracture patient compliant intervention relative patient refuse give informed consent include intervention ( estimate 10-15 % patient fracture ) patient compliant ( estimate 40 % patient give consent participate ) . In addition , effect fracture rate become significant long period ( 3-5 year ) observation .</detailed_description>
