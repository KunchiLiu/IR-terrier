	<brief_summary>The investigator ' study 4 primary objective . Among patient undergo noncardiac surgery investigator determine : ( 1 ) incidence major perioperative vascular event ; ( 2 ) optimal clinical model predict major perioperative vascular event ; ( 3 ) proportion patient perioperative myocardial infarction may go undetected without perioperative troponin monitoring ; ( 4 ) relationship postoperative troponin measurement 1 year risk vascular death .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vascular Events In Noncardiac Surgery Patients Cohort Evaluation Study ( VISION )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The increase elderly patient undergo surgery , change invasiveness surgical intervention , limitation methodology generalizability previous research , VISION Pilot Study result highlight uncertainty current incidence major vascular event optimal clinical risk estimation model predict event patient undergo noncardiac surgery . There promise inconclusive preliminary evidence troponin measurement surgery may allow physician avoid miss perioperative myocardial infarction may predict mortality major vascular event first year follow surgery . These consideration provide impetus large , adequately power , multicentre , international , prospective cohort study . We determine incidence major vascular event , optimal clinical model predict major perioperative vascular event , extent troponin measurement post surgery identify myocardial infarction likely go unrecognized predict vascular death 1 year . We call study Vascular event In noncardiac Surgery patIents cOhort evaluatioN ( VISION ) Study . The VISION Study prospective cohort study 40,000 patient &gt; 45 year age , undergo noncardiac surgery require overnight hospital admission , receive general regional anesthetic . Hospitals ( include university non-university hospital ) several country around world recruit patient , 2 year period . Study personnel evaluate patient prior surgery , follow patient throughout hospitalization , contact patient 30 day 1 year surgery . All patient troponin T measure post surgery first , second , third day surgery . Outcome adjudicator adjudicate major vascular event without knowledge patient 's vascular risk factor . We also determine association preoperative postoperative medication major perioperative vascular event . We also determine association medication start major perioperative vascular event vascular mortality 1 year surgery . We evaluate 1 year risk stroke patient develop atrial fibrillation surgery association antiplatelet warfarin therapy . We measure N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) 8,000 - 10,000 patient prior surgery determine NT-proBNP independent predictor major perioperative vascular event . We determine incidence perioperative new acute renal failure require dialysis pneumonia develop model predict event .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient undergo noncardiac surgery eligible &gt; 45 year age receive general regional anesthetic ( i.e. , plexus block , spinal , epidural ) . We exclude patient undergoing noncardiac surgery require least overnight hospital admission surgery receive infiltrative ( i.e. , local ) topical anesthesia . We also exclude patient previously enrol VISION Study patient consent participate .</criteria>
