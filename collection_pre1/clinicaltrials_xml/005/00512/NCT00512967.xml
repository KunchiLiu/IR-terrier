	<brief_summary>Reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) suggest play pivotal role ILD . Little known , however , endogenous antioxidant level ILD offer protection ROS . It expect high amount ROS present ILD reduce antioxidant level . Therefore , antioxidant therapy strengthen reduce antioxidant defense might efficacious ILD treatment . Since ROS capable initiate mediate inflammation , antioxidant therapy might also mitigate elevated inflammation . A candidate antioxidant therapy flavonoid quercetin know anti-oxidative anti-inflammatory capacity . The aim present study determine antioxidant inflammatory status ILD , i.e . sarcoidosis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) . Furthermore , evaluate possible anti-inflammatory effect antioxidant , effect quercetin examine ex vivo LPS-induced cytokine production ILD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Occurence Inflammation Oxidative Stress Lung Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) include various chronic lung disorder sarcoidosis idiopathic lung fibrosis ( IPF ) . In Netherlands incidence sarcoidosis approximately 20-25 per 100.000 inhabitant whereas IPF approximately 1000-1500 new case year . In short , three different stage development ILD discern . Firstly , lung tissue damage . In sarcoidosis damage think antigen-driven , multisystemically lead formation granuloma . Moreover , suggest genetic factor play important role genesis sarcoidosis . In IPF exact etiology damage unknown , speculate inflicted unidentified stimulus produce repeat episode acute lung injury Secondly , wall air sac lung become inflamed reaction cause damage . This result activation inflammatory cell like macrophage cause expression pro-inflammatory cytokine , especially interleukin-10 tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha , lung . Finally , scar ( fibrosis ) begin interstitium ( tissue air sac ) lung become stiff , cause irreversible loss tissue 's ability transfer oxygen . It well-known inflammation play key-role occurrence progression ILD , although long-lasting hypothesis inflammation alone lead fibrosis question moment . Conventional treatment ILD comprise nonspecific anti-inflammatory agent glucocorticoid ( prednisone ) immune-suppressing medication cyclophosphamide , methotrexate gamma-interferon . However , therapy fail completely efficacious , suggest inflammation alone indeed solely responsible occurrence progression ILD . Paradoxically , anti-TNF-Î± agent infliximab thalidomide recently show beneficial effect sarcoidosis . A pivotal role reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) three stage also propose . Various biomarkers oxidative stress , i.e . exhale ethane 8-isoprostane oxidized protein bronchoalveolar fluid , elevate ILD patient different clinical stage . However , little known effect elevate oxidative stress endogenous antioxidant level present ILD . Interestingly , clinical administration antioxidant , i.e . N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , IPF patient recently demonstrate slows deterioration vital capacity carbon monoxide diffuse capacity ( DLCO ) 12 month . This support hypothesis oxidative stress involve ILD proofs principle antioxidant treatment ILD . It well-known oxidative stress inflammation intertwine pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha capable stimulate oxidative stress various cell tissue . As result , preliminary beneficial effect anti-TNF-alpha agent combine preliminary beneficial effect antioxidant ILD may indicate new strategy treatment ILD ideally combine reduction oxidative stress inflammation occur disease . Recently , much attention give potential health-beneficial property flavonoid , natural occur polyphenolic compound , quercetin , commonly occur flavonoid , particular . Quercetin known powerful antioxidant posse anti-inflammatory effect . It therefore tempt speculate quercetin could exert positive effect ILD . Since anti-oxidative inflammatory change ILD still exactly know , aim present study determine anti-oxidant inflammatory status ILD , i.e . sarcoidosis fibrosis . Furthermore , possible anti-inflammatory effect antioxidant LPS-induced cytokine production , exemplify flavonoid quercetin , examine .</detailed_description>
