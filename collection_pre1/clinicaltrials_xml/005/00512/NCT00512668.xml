	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose temsirolimus give together hormone therapy treat patient relapsed prostate cancer . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Hormone therapy may fight prostate cancer lower amount androgen body make . Temsirolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving hormone therapy together temsirolimus may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hormone Therapy Temsirolimus Treating Patients With Relapsed Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize safety drug-related adverse event two dos ( 15 25 mg ) intravenous weekly temsirolimus combine short term complete androgen ablation select favorable tolerable dose prostate cancer patient experience biochemical failure prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To archive tissue blood component future study molecular marker response disease progression . II . To evaluate effect 2 dose level temsirolimus change phosphorylation state protein mTOR pathway use western blot peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive combine androgen ablation therapy comprise luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue ( i.e. , leuprolide acetate intramuscularly monthly goserelin subcutaneously every 3 month ) oral anti-androgen drug ( i.e. , bicalutamide nilutamide daily flutamide 3 time daily ) day 1-90 . * Beginning day 60 hormonal therapy , patient receive temsirolimus IV 30 minute weekly . Treatment temsirolimus continue 36 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients may receive 3 month hormonal therapy , include therapy initiate within 2 month study entry . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
