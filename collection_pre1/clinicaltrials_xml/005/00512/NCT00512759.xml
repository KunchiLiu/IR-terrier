	<brief_title>Goal-directed Afterload Reduction Acute Congestive Cardiac Decompensation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Heart failure ( HF ) chronic progressive illness result variety cardiac cause , include ischemic valvular heart disease , dilatative cardiomyopathy hypertension . HF may also develop suddenly , particularly complication acute myocardial infarction acute exacerbation patient previously compensate chronic HF . Acute HF require immediate treatment center reduce myocardial oxygen demand augment forward blood flow removal excess fluid diuretic reduction preload afterload vasodilatators . The age population high number patient survive acute myocardial infarction lead dramatic increase incidence prevalence HF , obviously also total cost burden disease . For multiple reason include need restrictive use limit number ICU hospital bed vast majority elderly patient acute HF treat non-ICU setting . Unfortunately , optimal treatment acute HF non-ICU set well define . Pathophysiological consideration preliminary data ICU set suggest aggressive venous arterial vasodilation may improve short long-term outcome . Aim : To test hypothesis : • An early goal-directed decrement preload afterload target systolic blood pressure 90-110 mmHg aggressive vasodilatation patient acute HF non-ICU setting safe , lead well clinical economical outcome Methods : Design : Prospective , randomize , control , open label , interventional study Setting : University Hospital Basel Patients : Patients acute HF require ICU admission Patients admit emergency department acute HF randomize : - Early goal-directed preload afterload decrement use fix therapy schedule include sublingual transdermal nitrate , hydralazine , follow rapid up-titration ACE-inhibitors AT-receptor blocker achieve maximal vasodilatation target systolic blood pressure 90-110 mmHg . All element treatment accord current guideline European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) - Standard treatment acute HF accord current guideline ESC . Clinical Significance : Despite clinical economical importance acute HF , optimal treatment acute HF ill-defined . We strongly believe novel therapeutic strategy significantly reduce morbidity , length hospitalisation , possibly mortality affect patient . This would represent first major step evidence-based management common condition . Documenting medical economic benefit simple , safe , inexpensive medical therapy randomise controlled clinical trial would provide evidence-based care majority patient present acute HF worldwide . All drug apply strategy off-patent therefore relatively low-cost . Successful implication treatment algorithm potential significantly reduce treatment cost .</detailed_description>
