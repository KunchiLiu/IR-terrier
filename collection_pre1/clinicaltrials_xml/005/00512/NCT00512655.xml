	<brief_summary>Background : Approximately 750,000 elderly Dutch people fall least year , often result physical injury fear fall , high cost far-reaching consequence functionality , physical activity , quality life mental well-being . Falling burden patient , also burden caregiver . Recurrent fall complex problem . However , pathophysiological background fall , gait problem dementia largely unknown . The general pathophysiological hallmark age liability homeostatic mechanism organ . This liability result impaired ability adapt stress increase biological variation outcome measure within individual . In study investigator aim develop intervention reduce recurrent fall frail elderly faller . Hypotheses : The investigator hypothesize intervention program decrease number fall fear fall increase mental well-being , physical activity functional performance frail elderly people history recurrent fall . In addition , burden caregiver reduce due intervention cost-effective . Furthermore , investigator hypothesize patient high short-term intra-individual biological variability gait cognition variables high risk fall , bad gait performance cognitive decline long term follow-up . Study Design : Randomized , control , single-blind trial . Study Population : 160 patient refer geriatric outpatient clinic , fell least last 6 month primary caregiver ( N=160 ) . Intervention : A multifaceted fall prevention program frail elder reduce fall incidence rate , consist physical cognitive component . Moreover , include train program caregiver learn support give advice patient , aim decrease burden caregiver . Primary Outcome Measures : The fall incidence rate primary outcome measure . Total observation time fall 6 month start intervention . Secondary Outcome Measures : In patient , secondary outcome measure fear fall ( FES ) , quality life ( MOS-20 ) , depression general anxiety , functional performance activity daily live , physical activity , mobility , gait parameter , body sway biomarkers endothelial function frailty . For caregiver , secondary outcome measure caregiver 's burden , mood quality life . In addition , intraindividual variability cognition , balance gait patient caregiver , assess cost-effectiveness intervention also determine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nature Extent Burden Risks Associated Participation , Benefit Group Relatedness : The outcome study may important reflection protocols prevent fall among elder health care decision maker stimulate start new fall clinic implement protocol . Through study , well-being functionality frail elder caregiver could improve . As fall enormous economic burden , new effective fall prevention intervention could reduce health care cost substantially . The test consist questionnaire gait balance measurement non-invasive safe . Taking blood sample invasive procedure , although serious adverse effect expect . There foreseeable risk associate participation study . However , burden place participate individual train session measurement time-consuming .</detailed_description>
