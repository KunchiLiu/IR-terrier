	<brief_summary>1 . The primary objective study : 1 . To determine tolerability RTA 744 Injection patient leptomeningeal disease ( LMD ) secondary type primary tumor . 2 . In select group 6-10 patient receive RTA 744 near maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , characterize multiple-dose pharmacokinetics RTA 744 plasma CSF . 2 . The secondary objective study : 1 . To document potential antitumor activity RTA 744 patient population . 2 . To correlate pharmacokinetic information clinical ( efficacy safety ) response , possible help select appropriate dos later study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RTA 744 design enter spinal fluid kill cancer cell spinal fluid rest body . Before start receiving study drug , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . Your complete medical history record . You ask drug take take . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . You neurological exam . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test woman able child . To eligible take part study , pregnancy test must negative . Urine collect 24-hour period test kidney function routine test . You magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain spine . You chest x-ray . You ask question ability perform daily activity ( performance status evaluation ) . You electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) . You either multiple gated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) echocardiogram check heart 's health . Samples ( 1 1/2 teaspoon ) cerebrospinal fluid spine brain collect look presence cancer cell . The spinal sample collect lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) . The sample take brain Ommaya Reservoir tap . Radioactive dye inject CSF make sure CSF flow freely throughout spinal canal . This call Indium-111 DPTA Technetium 99m-DPTA Flow Study . If find eligible take part study , receive dose RTA 744 throughout study . The amount study drug receive determine begin study . Every 21 day study consider 1 study `` cycle . '' If intolerable side effect , drug dose next cycle may delay 21 day allow symptom side effect resolve . You may give low dose level . The first participant study receive dose find well-tolerated ongoing study involve participant primary brain tumor . After participant complete 1 study cycle , next participant give high dose RTA 744 . Each new participant receive high dose level patient intolerable side effect . When happen , least 2 participant give dose level cause intolerable side effect . If intolerable side effect RTA 744 , next group 3 participant give next high dose RTA 744 . Each time , dose RTA 744 increase effect previous dose level study . Doses increase group patient high tolerable dose find . On Day 1 Cycle 1 , receive first dose RTA 744 , physical exam , neurological exam , performance status evaluation . If screening neurological exam perform less 1 week Day 1 , neurological exam need repeat . You also ask drug , treatment , herbal medicine take . You ask feel whether experience symptom side effect . Blood ( less 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test , unless blood urine collect screen within past 72 hour . After completion test , receive RTA 744 needle vein 2-hour period Days 1-3 . You must remain clinic 2 hour drug give make sure side effect . During Cycle 1 , ask return clinic week 3 week . At visit , blood ( le 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . You ask feel whether side effect . On Day 21 , neurologic exam . Before receive study drug Day 1 Cycles 2-18 , physical exam , neurological exam , performance status evaluation . You also ask drug , treatment , herbal medicine take . Blood ( less 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . You ECG . Before Cycles 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14,16 , 18 , MUGA scan echocardiogram . Once completed test , receive study drug manner Cycle 1 . During Days 1-3 , ask feeling report symptom side effect may notice receive RTA 744 . On Day 15 , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This blood draw may perform outside laboratory . If clinic visit schedule Day 15 , contact telephone find experienced side effect . This phone call last le 5 minute . On Day 21 , blood ( le 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . One time ( per cycle ) Day 15 Day 21 Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , sample ( 2 teaspoon time ) CSF collect spine spinal tap , brain Ommaya Reservoir tap . This do order look cancer cell . You also MRI brain spine . An ECG perform last week cycle . A MUGA scan echocardiogram perform last week Cycles 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 . You MRI within 1 week end last cycle . You may remain study 18 cycle ( 13 month ) . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Once study , end-of-study visit . At visit , complete medical history record . You ask drug take take . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . You neurological exam . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Urine collect 24-hour period test kidney function routine test . You MRI brain spine . You chest x-ray . You performance status evaluation . You ECG MUGA scan echocardiogram . Samples ( 1 1/2 teaspoon ) cerebrospinal fluid spine brain collect look presence cancer cell . The spinal sample collect spinal tap . The sample take brain Ommaya Reservoir tap . Radioactive dye also inject CSF make sure CSF flow freely throughout spinal canal . THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY . RTA 744 FDA approve commercially available . It authorize use research . Up 18 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
