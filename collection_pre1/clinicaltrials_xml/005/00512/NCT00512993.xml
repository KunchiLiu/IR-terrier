	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine event-free survival ( EFS ) zoledronic acid 5 year versus postoperative treatment patient `` chemo-insensitive '' breast cancer ( ypT1-4 and/or ypN1-3 ) preoperative anthracycline/taxane contain chemotherapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Postoperative Use Zoledronic Acid Breast Cancer Patients After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study restrict patient primary systemic chemotherapy stage II III breast cancer . Participation preoperative chemotherapy trial investigate anthracycline taxane base regimen allow , mandatory patient . Patients must significant remain tumor tissue breast and/or axillary lymph node . This imply resistance chemotherapy clinically relevant risk relapse . Bisphosphonates distinct mechanism action demonstrate efficacy treatment breast cancer metastasis bone well adjuvant treatment surgery primary breast cancer . The 3rd generation bisphosphonate zoledronic acid favorable toxicity profile conveniently give patient long term period .</detailed_description>
