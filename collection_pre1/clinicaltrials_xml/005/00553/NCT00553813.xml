	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial TPI 287 Patients Advanced , Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open-label , single arm Phase 2 study patient advance , unresectable pancreatic cancer receive prior gemcitabine-based chemotherapy disease . Patients receive TPI 287 administer 60-minute ( ± 10 min ) IV infusion . The primary endpoint trial 6-month survival rate . Additional efficacy endpoint response rate , duration response stable disease , 6-month progression free survival . Responses assess reduction radiographically measurable disease define RECIST criterion . Time worsen clinical status base reduction pain and/or analgesic use change tumor marker ( CA 19-9 ) also follow . Patients remain study tumor progression death , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent discontinuation base Investigator discretion .
