	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , epratuzumab rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving epratuzumab rituximab together may effective treat follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give epratuzumab together rituximab work treat patient previously untreated follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epratuzumab Rituximab Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Follicular Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine response rate ( overall complete ) extend induction therapy comprise epratuzumab rituximab patient previously untreated CD20+ follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . - To determine time progression extend induction therapy comprise epratuzumab rituximab patient previously untreated CD20+ follicular NHL . Secondary - To determine toxicity profile epratuzumab rituximab patient previously untreated CD20+ follicular NHL . - To establish whether therapeutic effect combination epratuzumab rituximab sufficiently promise warrant evaluation subsequent randomize trial ( comparison rituximab alone ) . - To determine relationship change fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake early epratuzumab rituximab treatment response rate time progression . OUTLINE : - Induction therapy ( month 1 ) : Patients receive epratuzumab IV 5-30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 rituximab IV day 3 , 8 , 15 , 22 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Extended induction therapy ( month 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 ) : Patients receive epratuzumab IV 5-30 minute follow rituximab IV week 12 , 20 , 28 , 36 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) subcutaneously undergo positron emission tomography baseline induction therapy ass degree FDG uptake . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 month 2 year every 6 month 10 year .</detailed_description>
