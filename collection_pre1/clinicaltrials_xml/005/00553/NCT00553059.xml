	<brief_title>Palonosetron Dexamethasone With Without Dronabinol Preventing Nausea Vomiting Patients Receiving Chemotherapy For Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Dronabinol palonosetron design help prevent nausea vomit patient receive chemotherapy . Dexamethasone corticosteroid similar natural hormone make body . Dexamethasone often give MM patient combination chemotherapy treat cancer . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . - If Group 1 , take dronabinol , dexamethasone , palonosetron . - If Group 2 , take placebo , dexamethasone , palonosetron . A placebo substance look like study drug active ingredient . You equal chance assign either group . Neither doctor choose group . During study , study staff know group . However , need safety , study staff able find group . After last study participant complete study therapy , study staff find group . Study Drug Administration : On Day 1 ( day receive chemotherapy ) , take dronabinol/placebo pill mouth every 8 hour ( possible ) . If take pill every 8 hour , try space dose evenly . Your first dronabinol/placebo pill Day 1 30 minute chemotherapy . You also receive dexamethasone palonosetron vein 30 minute receive chemotherapy . On Days 2-6 , take dronabinol/placebo 3 time day . You take pill every 8 hour ( possible ) . If take every 8 hour , try space dose evenly . Study Diary : You complete study diary Days 1-6 . In diary answer question nausea vomit . Study Visits : You study visit Day 8 sometime Days 14-28 . At visit , ask experienced side effect . You return study diary clinic visit . At visit Days 14-28 , also physical exam . Length Study : You study 30 day . You take study early nausea vomit improve intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . Dronabinol palonosetron FDA approve commercially available prevent nausea vomit may occur chemotherapy . Dexamethasone FDA approve commercially available prevention side effect relate chemotherapy . The combination drug prevent nausea vomit investigational . Up 200 patient take part multicenter study . Up 200 enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
