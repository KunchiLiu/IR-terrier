	<brief_summary>Background : - PARP enzyme involve repair damage DNA . Levels enzyme high tumor cell normal cell , may play part resistance cancer chemotherapy radiation therapy . ABT-888 experimental drug inhibits PARP may help increase effectiveness cancer treatment design damage DNA cancer cell . - Topotecan drug approve Food Drug Administration treat certain cancer . - This dose escalation study test two drug successively high dos small group patient high safe dose determine . Objectives : - To test safety combination ABT-888 Topotecan ( TPT ) determine high dose drug safely give human . This maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . - To learn combination ABT-888 TPT work human body handle drug . - To determine side effect combination ABT-888 TPT test dos . Eligibility : -Patients solid tumor , lymphomas chronic lymphocytic leukemia whose disease progress follow standard therapy standard treatment available . Design : - ABT-888 TPT give 21-day treatment cycle . At start study , TPT infuse vein 30 minute week cycle 1 start . Starting day 1 cycle 1 , ABT-888 give mouth twice day 7 day . TPT give vein daily 4 day start day 2 . After last dose ABT-888 day 7 , treatment give rest 21-day cycle . - For remain cycle , ABT-888 give twice day mouth day 1 7 cycle , TPT give vein daily day 1 5 cycle . - The first three six patient enrol study take small study dose drug . If develop significant adverse side effect , successive small group patient take drug increasingly high dos MTD reach . Additional patient enrol receive MTD . - Patients periodic clinic visit TPT infusion test examination . Evaluations include measurement vital sign , physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram CT imaging test , ultrasound MRI . Tumor biopsy may request study effect drug ...</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study ABT-888 Plus Topotecan Hydrochloride Treat Patients With Solid Tumors Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - The PARP family enzymes characterized ability poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ate protein substrates . PARP-1 PARP-2 play critical role maintenance genomic stability regulate variety DNA repair mechanism . - Poly ( ADP-ribosylated ) PARP-1 show block formation topo 1-DNA cleavage accelerate removal camptothecin-stabilized topo 1-DNA complex . PARP-1 inhibition may therefore prevent efficient repair DNA damage induce topoisomerase 1 inhibitor . ABT-888 oral PARP inhibitor topotecan topoisomerase I inhibitor . Objectives : - Establish safety tolerability combination ABT-888 topotecan hydrochloride patient refractory solid tumor lymphomas . - Establish maximum tolerate dose combination ABT-888 topotecan hydrochloride . - Evaluate pharmacokinetics agent alone combination . - Determine effect study treatment level PARP inhibition DNA damage PBMCs tumor sample . Eligibility : - Patients histologically document solid tumor lymphoid malignancy ( lymphoma CLL ) whose disease progress follow standard therapy acceptable standard treatment option . - No major surgery , radiation chemotherapy within four week prior study enrollment , recover toxicity prior therapy least eligibility level . Study Design : - Cycle 1 , dose level -1 7 1B : Topotecan ( TPT ) administer intravenously 30 minute single dose day 1-5 . Starting day 2 , ABT-888 administer orally twice day q12 hour schedule 4 day ( D2-5 ) . Following completion study drug administration day 5 , treatment administer rest 21-day cycle . Growth factor administer prophylactically start Cycle 1 patient dose level 1B . - Cycle 2 beyond , dose level -1 7 1B : ABT-888 administered twice day q12 hour schedule orally day 1-5 . TPT give IV daily day 1-5 , 21-day cycle . Growth factor administer prophylactically patient dose level 1B . - All cycle , dose level -2 1A 5A : ABT-888 administered day 1 dose level -2 1A , 2A , 3A , 4A . For dose level 5A , ABT-888 administer day 1 2 cycle . TPT give IV daily day 1-5 , 21-day cycle . - Dose escalation proceed outline . Once maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) establish , 6 additional patient enrol MTD define dose evaluate PD study dose level .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients histologically document solid tumor lymphoid malignancy ( lymphoma CLL ) refractory standard therapy acceptable standard treatment option . Patients lymphoid malignancy eligible disease progress follow standard therapy stem cell transplantation indicate refuse . 2 . Any prior therapy must complete great equal 4 week prior enrollment protocol participant must recover eligibility level ( CTCAE Grade less equal 1 ) prior toxicity . Prior radiation surgery complete great equal 4 week prior study enrollment associate toxicity resolve eligibility level . Patients must great equal 2 week since investigational agent administer part Phase 0 study , recover eligibility level toxicity . 3 . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use ABT888 patient less 18 year age , child exclude study , may eligible future pediatric Phase I combination trial . 4 . ECOG performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 60 percent ) . 5 . Life expectancy great 3 month . 6 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL platelet great equal 100,000/mcL total bilirubin le 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal creatinine le 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min patient creatinine level institutional normal . 7 . The effect ABT888 develop human fetus unknown . For reason topotecan hydrochloride use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 30 day completion study . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 8 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients must great equal 2 week since investigational agent administer part Phase 0 study , recover eligibility level toxicity . Patients administer ABT888 part single limit dose study , Phase 0 study , exclude participate study solely receive prior ABT888 . Patients receive prior TPT exclude solely receive prior TPT . 2 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , prolong QTc interval ( great msec ) , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 3 . Patients know brain mestastases history seizure exclude clinical trial .</criteria>
