	<detailed_description>- This study compare effect Coreg CR lisinopril , separately together , Rasmussen Disease Score control study inactive substance ( placebo ) . - Study patient pre-hypertensive ( slightly elevate ) blood pressure require therapy . - Lisinopril angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor . Angiotensin chemical make body continuously . Angiotensin narrow blood vessel thereby maintains ( elevates ) blood pressure . When enzyme block lisinopril , angiotensin convert active form . As result , blood pressure lower . Lisinopril drug approve use U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) health authority treatment high blood pressure heart failure . - Coreg CR once-a-day heart medication part class drug know beta-blockers . Beta-blockers prevent beta-adrenergic substance adrenaline activate part nervous system , include heart . Beta-blockers therefore relieve stress heart slow heart beat , decrease force heart muscle contraction , reduce blood pressure . Coreg also approve FDA treatment hypertension various cardiovascular condition . - It possible beta blocker could increase benefit ACE inhibitor inhibit renin production , important step angiotensin production . These two drug may act together provide even protection blood vessel heart .</detailed_description>
