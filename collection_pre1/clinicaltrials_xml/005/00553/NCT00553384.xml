	<brief_summary>The reason research understand different people show different response smell odor call androstadienone . Androstadienone chemical find male sweat . Other study show smell chemical cause people experience sweat , change skin temperature , change stress hormone call cortisol . These response , call `` physiological effect , '' strong people others . We interest find whether individual difference genetic , cause difference gene . Humans 1000 gene odorant receptor . These molecule bind detect odor molecule nose allow u respond many different odor . It show gene exist two form : functional one one mutate therefore longer functional . We think people respond specific odor may carry non-functional form gene receptor detect odor molecule . To test idea want find people respond strongly specific smell , compare odorant receptor gene people respond weakly odor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consist five visit . The first visit screen visit eligibility subject determine blood sample take . At visit , subject also give ovulation test strip instruction perform urine-based ovulation self-tests home period several day follow onset menstruation . The subject instruct test urine home LH surge detect . When subject ovulate available visit come Rockefeller University Hospital within one day detect LH surge first four Test Sessions . The four Test Sessions identical exception subject expose different odor stimulus . We measure : 1. skin temperature 2. sweating , measure skin conductance 3. salivary cortisol level . 4. mood</detailed_description>
