	<brief_summary>Gaucher disease rare lysosomal storage disorder cause deficiency enzyme glucocerebrosidase ( GCB ) . Due deficiency functional GCB , glucocerebroside accumulates within macrophage lead cellular engorgement , organomegaly , organ system dysfunction . The purpose non-inferiority study evaluate efficacy safety GA-GCB ( velaglucerase alfa ) administer every week comparison imiglucerase treatment naive patient type 1 Gaucher disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Gene-Activated® Human Glucocerebrosidase ( GA-GCB ) ERT Compared With Imiglucerase Type I Gaucher Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 1 Gaucher disease , common form , account 90 % case involve CNS . Typical manifestation type 1 Gaucher disease include hepatomegaly , splenomegaly , thrombocytopenia , bleed tendency , anemia , hypermetabolism , skeletal pathology , growth retardation , pulmonary disease , decrease quality life . Gene-Activated® human glucocerebrosidase ( GA-GCB ; velaglucerase alfa ) produce continuous human cell line use proprietary gene-activation technology identical amino acid sequence naturally occur human enzyme . GA-GCB ( velaglucerase alfa ) contain terminal mannose residue target enzyme macrophages-the primary target cell Gaucher disease . This study design determine efficacy safety GA-GCB ( velaglucerase alfa ) comparison imiglucerase men , woman , child Type 1 Gaucher disease .</detailed_description>
