	<brief_title>Open Label Study Evaluating Different Dosing Regimens Rabeprazole Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease ( GERD ) Patients With Night-time Heartburn Symptoms .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There limit data regard estimate patient experience nocturnal symptom despite adequate daytime heartburn control , incidence severity nocturnal heartburn episode minimum 4 week acid suppressive therapy Proton-pump inhibitor ( PPI ) Histamine -2-receptor antagonist ( H2RA ) , effect institute rabeprazole therapy failure control nocturnal heartburn symptom acid suppressive therapy . This multicentre , randomise ( study medication assign chance ) , control , parallel-group , open-label study GERD patient . Patients screen enter 2-week run-in phase document heartburn symptom current therapy , complete daily diary symptom antacid use . Patients troublesome nocturnal heartburn episode , adequate daytime heartburn symptom control ( define ) enter 8-week treatment phase randomise one rabeprazole regimens : 20mg daily evening ( dose administer 30minutes prior even meal ; `` QPM '' regimen ) , 10mg twice daily ( dose administer 30minutes prior morning evening meal ; `` BID/twice daily '' regimen ) 20mg daily morning ( dose administer 30minutes prior morning meal ; `` QAM/every morning '' regimen ) , plus antacid require . The study hypothesis failure control night-time heartburn symptom acid suppressive therapy , institute rabeprazole beneficial effect . Safety assessment include : physical examination pregnancy test screening , vital sign weight randomization final visit , adverse event concomitant medication reporting every visit . Rabeprazole 20mg daily evening : one rabeprazole 20mg tablet daily evening , 30-60 minute dinner 56 day OR Rabeprazole 10mg twice daily : one rabeprazole 10mg tablet morning , 30-60 minute breakfast , one rabeprazole 10mg tablet 30-60 minute dinner 56 day . OR Rabeprazole 20mg daily morning : one rabeprazole 20mg tablet daily morning , 30-60 minute breakfast 56 day .</detailed_description>
