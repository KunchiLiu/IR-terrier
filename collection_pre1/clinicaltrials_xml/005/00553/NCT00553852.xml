	<brief_summary>Obesity obesity-related disease reach epidemic proportion Western country ( 1-3 ) . Laparoscopic-adjustable silicone gastric banding ( LASGB ) purely restrictive operation determine effective weight loss without induce malabsorption ( 4-6 ) . However , also LASGB body weight loss almost invariably associate Free Fat Mass ( FFM ) loss , relevance FFM contribution total energy expenditure well-known ( 7-8 ) . Different endocrine ax report affect FFM . We previously report low level DHEA-S , adrenal steroid controversial anti-adipogenic anti-atherogenic effect , increase massive sustainable weight loss induce LASGB severely obese premenopausal woman correlate high post-operative FFM ( 9-10 ) . It also well know GH/IGF-I axis exerts relevant effect FFM reduce GH level might increase Fat Mass ( FM ) reduce FFM ( 11,12 ) . Morbidly obese patient reduce GH secretion , generally reversible weight loss ( 13-14 ) . In recent study currently press , report persistent deficiency GH/IGF-I axis obese female associate low decrease FM LASGB . Low IGF-I plasma level also report independent prognostic factor liver steatosis non-alcoholic steatohepatitis morbidly obese patient ( 15 ) ultrasound- measure hepatic leave lobe volume might represent reliable tool evaluation liver involvement obesity ( 16 ) . GH deficiency ( GHD ) adult patient associated increase FM parallel decrease FFM ( 17 ) . The severity GDH correlate cardiovascular risk , body composition abnormalities bone loss , decrease leave ventricular ejection fraction ( 18-20 ) . GH therapy demonstrate effective normalizing body composition , beneficial effect 2-years follow-up period ( 21-24 ) . GH therapy also report effective sparing FFM weight loss obese patient metabolic syndrome ( 25,26 ) . However , study limitation due duration treatment lack preliminary evaluation GH/IGF-I axis secretory status obese patient GH therapy . At present data evaluation GH/IGF-I status bariatric surgery effectiveness recombinant GH treatment severe obese patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Replacement GH Therapy After Bariatric Surgery Patients With Very Severe Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study : 1 . To evaluate GH/GF-I status correlation body composition severe obese patient . IGF-I level classify deficient standard deviation score mean &lt; -2 age gender . 2 . To evaluate efficacy medical treatment recombinant GH replacement therapy severe obese patient LASGB Fat mass ( % ) , free fat mass ( % ) , percent decrease fat mass . In line GHD diagnosis , obese patient persistent GHD bariatric surgery randomize treat without recombinant GH therapy replacement dos , addition control trial dietary management , routinely perform LASGB . Study protocol The study protocol include two different arm : correlation observational longitudinal open study ( Phase I ) , treatment study ( Phase II ) . PHASE I : In correlation study clinical , biochemical instrumental evaluation perform 20-30 patient severe obesity ( grade III ) GHD followed-up multi-disciplinary approach Unit Endocrinology Departments Molecular Clinical Endocrinology Oncology Physiology Nutrition Unit Department Neuroscience Department Surgery `` S. Giovanni Bosco '' Hospital Naples , accord current criterion National Institute Health ( 27 ) . The clinical examination focus GH/IGF-I status effect body composition change LASGB . The clinical examination determine anthropometric index ( weight , height , BMI , waist circumference ) . The biochemical evaluation include measurement lipid profile , fast plasma glucose insulin , liver test function , FT3 , FT4 , GHRH + Arginine test detect GHD , plasma IGF-I level . The instrumental evaluation include DEXA Total Body bioimpedance analysis determine body composition , liver ultrasound . PHASE II : In medical treatment protocol severe obese patient persistent GHD LASGB inclose . Starting 15-day , GHD patient re-evaluated GHRH + Arginine test . After evaluation , patient persistent GHD randomize treat Recombinant GH replacement therapy ( Group A : Recombinant GH replacement therapy initial dose 0.15-0.30 mg/die ; dose adjustment make accord IGF-I level ; Group B : GH treatment ) . In subgroup , diet arrange fit energy intake 5.7 MJ/day ( 55 % carbohydrate , 25 % fat , 20 % protein , 30 g fiber ) moderate-intensity activity ( brisk walk 30-45 min/day ) encourage . The evaluation medical treatment efficacy base analysis change anthropometric index , IGF-I level , liver function test , body composition assess DEXA Total Body bioimpedance analysis , liver ultrasounds . At 3 6 month , patient subgroups A B clinically re-evaluated , plasma sample metabolic , liver function test , endocrine profile obtain , body composition liver ultrasound determine . At end 6-months period treatment observation , GH response subsequent GHRH + Arginine re-tested confirm exclude GHD . All patient persistent GHD continue recombinant GH therapy .</detailed_description>
