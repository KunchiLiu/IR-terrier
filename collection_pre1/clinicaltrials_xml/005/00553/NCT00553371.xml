	<brief_title>Follow-up Evaluation Using CT Scans Patients Who Have Been Treated For Metastatic Testicular Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To assess frequency relapse recurrent abnormality detect CT scan patient long-term follow-up metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumour ( NSGCT ) . - To assess utility CT scan-assessment patient . - To assess prognostic factor predictive late relapse NSGCT . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients screen CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis detectable abnormality indication late relapse . Scans classify positive negative , accord standard CT criterion , radiologist expertise testicular cancer imaging . Patients negative scan follow yearly clinical examination tumor marker assessment , every 5 year CT imaging . Additional follow-up perform discretion attend physician . Patients positive scan undergo confirmation relapse , whenever possible , surgical excision biopsy treatment initiate accord best clinical practice . If follow-up scan equivocal , patient advise follow-up scan affect region 6 month .</detailed_description>
