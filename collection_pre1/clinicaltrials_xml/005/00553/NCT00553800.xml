	<brief_title>Study Bevacizumab Erlotinib Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There definite evidence superior therapy advance non-small cell lung cancer elderly patient . With exception one known study , single agent erlotinib study exclusively elderly combination erlotinib bevacizumab never study exclusively treatment naive elderly . This important population need less toxic therapy .</detailed_description>
