	<brief_title>Selumetinib Treating Patients With Biliary Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response rate ( complete response [ CR ] partial response [ PR ] ) patient unresectable biliary carcinoma treat AZD6244 ( selumetinib ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity profile drug patient . II . To evaluate 6- 12-month survival , 6-month progression-free survival , overall survival rate patient treated drug . III . To correlate genetic mutation , epigenetic silencing , and/or protein level RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signal pathway activation therapeutic efficacy AZD6244 patient . IV . To genotype tumor presence RAS mutation ( i.e. , NRAS , KRAS , HRAS ) BRAF mutation ( e.g. , V600E ) biliary tumor sample patient . V. To assess presence activation MEK1 , MEK2 , ERK , and/or Akt pathways tumor sample patient . VI . To assess epigenetic alteration ( i.e. , methylation ) affect level gene/protein expression RASSF1A , NORE1A , NORE1B tumor sample patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral selumetinib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Formalin fix paraffin-embedded tissue block fresh tissue sample obtain patient prior treatment . Tissue sample analyze immunohistochemistry expression level target protein ( MEK , p-MEK , ERK , p-ERK , Akt , p-AKT , RASSF1A , NORE1A NORE1B ) ; PCR mutational status target gene RAS , BRAF EGFR ) ; methylation-specific PCR methylation target gene promoter ( promoter RASSF1A , NORE1A NORE1B ) . Samples also analyze quantitative real-time PCR compare methylation status . Fresh frozen tissue , available , evaluated Western analysis measure expression level target protein . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
