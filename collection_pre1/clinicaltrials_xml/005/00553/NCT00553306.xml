	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Laboratory-treated T cell may able kill tumor cell put back body . Aldesleukin cyclophosphamide may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Giving laboratory-treated T cell together aldesleukin cyclophosphamide may effective treatment melanoma . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect give laboratory-treated T cell together aldesleukin cyclophosphamide see well work treat patient stage IV melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laboratory-Treated T Cells Aldesleukin After Cyclophosphamide Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety toxicity cellular adoptive immunotherapy melanoma patient use autologous CD4+ CD8+ antigen-specific T cell clone . II . To evaluate antitumor effect CD4+ CD8+ antigen-specific T cell patient metastatic melanoma . III . To determine duration vivo persistence adoptively transfer CD8+ antigen-specific T cell clone presence absence transfer CD4+ T cell . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess vivo antitumor efficacy infuse autologous antigen-specific CD4+ T cell . OUTLINE : This phase I study follow phase II study . Beginning 48 hour T-cell infusion , patient receive cyclophosphamide IV . Patients receive antigen-specific CD8+ T cell IV alone CD4+ T helper clone 1-2 hour day 0 . Patients also receive aldesleukin subcutaneously twice daily day 0-13 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow weekly 8 week , periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
