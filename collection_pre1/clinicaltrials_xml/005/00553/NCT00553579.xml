	<brief_summary>The benefit artificial tear relieve dry eye symptom include , limited : stabilize tear film layer , fluid supplement action , improve visual acuity , comfort . Studies find relationship benefit . For example , stabilization tear film important increase tear break time ( TBUT ) , key improve maintain visual acuity . These study allude fact may may relationship residence time visual performance . Viscosity one reason behind uncertainty . Some solution contain polymer influence ocular surface contact . This impact residence time ultimately visual performance . No prior research explore direct relationship residence time visual performance . Residence time refers duration artificial tear resides eye . Methods develop assess residence time admix fluorescent tracer solution measure amount fluorescence time . The caveat method use certain tracer lead uncertainty elimination measurement due corneal penetration differ molecular weight ( MW ) active vehicle ingredient solution . For example , low-MW tracer eliminate different rate higher-MW polymer . In addition , low-MW tracer may able penetrate corneal epithelium give false pre-corneal residence time . Meadows , Paugh , Joshi , Mordaunt address issue develop technique use polymer penetrate cornea MW active ingredient solution FITC-dextran . Based assumption similar weight eliminate rate , technique show economic , manageable , amendable previous procedure measure residence time . Any ophthalmic drop potential impact visual acuity upon instillation due effect tear layer component . Studies observe take artificial tear continuously time tend stabilize tear layer thus minimize immediate drop contrast sensitivity upon instillation . Measuring visual effect artificial tear , use contrast sensitivity measure , provide valuable information therapeutic effect artificial tear mean stabilize tear film , thus improve visual acuity dry eye patient . But patient ? There difference residence time retention effect- often matter patient . Retention effect refers beneficial effect drop . Currently real measure retention effect . Doctors assess tear film objectively , strong correlation subjective dry symptom tear film stability . A possible reason lack correlation may due fact subjectivity difficult quantify . However , scale like Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) establish attempt quantify subjective experience visual quality . We use NRS gauge comfort drop upon initial application get general idea comfort drop provide user . Although several study do residence time visual effect ophthalmic formulation separately , current research correlate two aspect therapeutic efficacy . This study first concurrently investigate residence time ( use FITC-dextran ) visual effect ophthalmic formulation .</brief_summary>
