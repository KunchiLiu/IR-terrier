	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Letrozole may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make . It yet know regimen letrozole effective postmenopausal woman receive hormone therapy early-stage breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial compare two different regimen letrozole prevent cancer postmenopausal woman receive 4-6 year hormone therapy hormone receptor-positive , lymph node-positive , early-stage breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Letrozole Preventing Cancer Postmenopausal Women Who Have Received 4-6 Years Hormone Therapy Hormone Receptor-Positive , Lymph Node-Positive , Early-Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare disease-free survival ( DFS ) postmenopausal woman treat continuous letrozole 5 year vs intermittent letrozole 5-year period . Secondary - Compare overall survival patient treat two regimen . - Compare distant DFS patient . - Compare breast cancer-free interval patient . - Compare sit first DFS failure patient . - Compare second ( nonbreast ) malignancies patient . - Compare death without prior cancer event patient . - Compare adverse event result two regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord treatment center type prior endocrine therapy ( selective estrogen receptor modulators [ SERMs ] alone vs aromatase inhibitor [ AIs ] alone vs SERMs AIs least 1 month ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral letrozole daily 5 year . - Arm II : Patients receive oral letrozole daily first 9 month year 1 4 , follow 12 month year 5 . After completion study therapy , patient follow annually .</detailed_description>
