	<brief_summary>It well know Aldosterone ( aldo ) cause hypertension ( HBP ) . Since aldo know cause kidney retain sodium ( Na ) Na retention know cause HBP , think mechanism aldo cause HBP Na retention . Recent study suggest aldo many effect addition ability cause kidney retain Na . To test hypothesis aldo cause HBP manner involve Na retention , plan , protocol , give Eplerenone , specific aldo antagonist , patient dialysis HBP . A positive effect Eplerenone low HBP patient would support hypothesis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Aldosterone Cause Hypertension Non-Renal Mechanism ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Shortly structure aldosterone ( aldo ) determine ( 1 ) 1952 , effect kidney cause sodium ( Na ) retention potassium ( K ) hydrogen ion ( H ) excretion characterize ( 2,3 ) . Although ability aldo effect many transport epithelia well know , effect kidney retain sodium felt play important role Na retention cause edema , setting , hypertension ( HBP ) . Aldo show Edelman ( 4 ) bind specific receptor transport nucleus aldo responsive cell subsequently lead production aldo-induced protein . The first aldo receptor antagonist ) ARA ( , spironolactone , use clinically 30 year management edema past year new agent Eplerenone , structurally similar spironolactone , without side effect gynecomastia , come clinical use USA Israel . Treatment HBP usually direct cause HBP know , example , removal tumor release catecholamine correct renal artery stenosis . If HBP due primary aldosteronism , surgical removal tumor , use ARA usually effective ( 5,6 ) . When cause HBP know , traditionally call essential hypertension , therapy today frequently involve drug interfere RAS ( 7 ) , recently addition ARA usually include . Recently study Epstein others ( 8,9 ) show addition ARA drug management consider essential HPB reduce HBP 10 mmHg , thus suggest addition ARA routine tool available treat HBP important . Although mechanism addition ARA lower HBP clear , obvious suggestion block effect aldo kidney reabsorb Na increase excretion Na responsible lower HBP . In patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , time start dialysis HBP common attribute volume overload active RAS ( 10 ) . Early history hemodialysis potential RAS involve cause HBP unclear , study saralasin ( 11,12 ) , competitive angiotensin II antagonist , clearly show dialysis patient elevate plasma renin level renin involve cause HBP lead generation angiotensin II . Although number mechanism apart volume angiotensin II consider , little evidence today , include aldo , play regular role cause HBP dialysis setting . Because possibility aldosterone may contribute HBP patient dialysis , independent effect sodium excretion ( since patient excrete little urine ) , protocol design test possibility administer ARA patient chronic dialysis HBP . A positive result would strongly suggest effect low HBP independent sodium excretion . Such result would indicative non-Na mechanism ARA low HBP dialysis patient , would also suggest possibility ARA act non-Na mechanism lower HBP essential HBP . Is hyperkalemia concern protocol ? Although evidence aldo facilitate potassium excretion , even patient renal failure ( 13 ) increase GI excretion , several study recently demonstrate spironolactone ( 14,15 ) Eplerenone ( 16 ) give renal failure/ dialysis patient without development hyperkalemia . Thus , seem ARAs give patient chronic renal failure , include patient dialysis , without hyperkalemia routinely develop . Nevertheless , protocol , plasma potassium regularly measure minimize development hyperkalemia . A small study address question use Spironolactone ( 14 ) . Since show Eplerenone cause gynecomastia men , many dialysis patient men , use drug , rather Spironolactone , study . Rational Aims The role aldo cause HBP Na retain mechanism well describe . Since recent study suggest aldo may mechanisms action , protocol address possibility aldo cause HBP non-Na retaining mechanism . This do give ARA , Eplerenone , patient HBP dialysis . In patient kidney play role Na regulation . Thus , BP fall Eplerenone , observation would strongly support hypothesis aldo cause HBP non-Na retaining mechanism . Methods We select study participant adult hemodialysis patient treat thrice weekly Shaare Zedek Medical Center Dialysis Unit . Men woman qualify study hemodialysis therapy 3 month , average predialysis plasma potassium concentration le 5.6 mEq/L time enrollment nil minimal urine output ( &lt; 500 mL/24 h ) . All participate woman childbearing age negative pregnancy test result enter study . Additional exclusion criterion include know allergy Spironolactone Eplerenone ; acute illness ; hypotension , define predialysis systolic blood pressure le 100 mm Hg ; severe hypertension ( predialysis systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mm Hg ) ; decompensated heart failure ; inability give inform consent ; noncompliance . The Institutional Review Board Shaare Zedek Medical Center ask give approval study protocol . All participant give written-informed consent . We plan enrol 27 patient prospective , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , crossover study . At study start , participant administer either Eplerenone , 25 mg , placebo tablet orally twice daily 4 week . This 4-week period follow 3-week washout period . After washout period , patient cross treatment arm 4 week . Patients administer Eplerenone first 4 week give placebo last 4 week , vice versa . All patient serve control . Participants receive outpatient hemodialysis 3 time week use B. Braun CE0123 machine ( B. Braun , D-34212 Meisungen , Germany ) . All patient use B. Braun polysulfone membrane . To control effect volume blood pressure RAS , plan keep target postdialysis weight ( dry weight ) constant patient study . Dialysate sodium concentration hold constant 140 mEq/L patient , dialysate potassium concentration maintain 2 mEq/L thru study . We plan impose additional dietary potassium restriction beyond usual recommendation patient ESRD treat hemodialysis . We plan make change dialysate potassium concentration antihypertensive regimen . Because mandate alter antihypertensive regimen , target weight , dialysis potassium bath study , exclude patient hypotension , severe hypertension , hyperkalemia . To evaluate effect Eplerenone independent diuretic action , plan include oliguric anuric patient ( urine output &lt; 500 mL/24 h ) . We plan determine predialysis postdialysis weight , interdialytic weight gain ( IDWGs ) , systolic diastolic blood pressure patient calculate average 3 measurement obtain 1 week administration study medication ( baseline ) , week placebo Eplerenone treatment , last week washout period . At begin end treatment period , plan measure predialysis postdialysis plasma potassium aldosterone level , renin activity ( PRA ) , , nondialysis day , 24-hour urine excretion sodium , potassium , creatinine . We plan monitor predialysis plasma potassium concentration weekly subject . Predialysis blood sample obtain cannulation vascular access start dialysis session . We plan obtain postdialysis blood sample predialyzer blood sample port end hemodialysis session slow blood pump 50 100 mL/min . Shaare Zedek Medical Center Laboratory perform laboratory test . Statistical Methods Results present mean Â± SD . To compare clinical laboratory parameter , Student t-test use paired sample . Linear regression correlation use ass relationship 2 variable . Stepwise regression use identify predictor single variable . P le 0.05 used define statistical significance . We perform statistical analysis use standard software package .</detailed_description>
