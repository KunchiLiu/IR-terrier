	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well bortezomib lenalidomide work treat patient mantle cell lymphoma come back period improvement ( refractory ) respond treatment ( refractory ) . Bortezomib may also stop growth cancer cell block protein need cell growth . Lenalidomide may stimulate immune system kill cancer cell may also block growth new blood vessel necessary cell growth . Giving bortezomib lenalidomide may effective treatment relapse refractory mantle cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Lenalidomide Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response ( complete response [ CR ] partial response [ PR ] ) rate complete response ( CR ) rate bortezomib + lenalidomide therapy patient relapse refractory mantle cell lymphoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time progression therapy bortezomib + lenalidomide patient relapse refractory mantle cell lymphoma . II . To determine disease-free survival overall survival therapy bortezomib + lenalidomide patient relapse refractory mantle cell lymphoma . OUTLINE : Patients receive induction therapy comprise bortezomib intravenously ( IV ) 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete partial response best response completion induction therapy receive maintenance therapy comprise bortezomib IV day 1 8 lenalidomide PO QD day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually 2 year .</detailed_description>
