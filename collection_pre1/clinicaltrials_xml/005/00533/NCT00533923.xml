	<detailed_description>Allogeneic Transplantation Graft versus Disease Effect Over past three decade , transplantation allogeneic marrow graft emerge uniquely effective therapy patient hematologic malignancy , marrow failure syndrome , lethal genetic acquire diseases hematopoiesis.1-9 Allogeneic transplantation potentially result curative outcomes patient acute leukemia , chronic myelogenous leukemia , aplastic anemia , lymphoid malignancy standard therapy may effective . The anti-tumor effect mediate allogeneic lymphocyte essential factor eliminate residual disease post-transplant prevent subsequent relapse.10-14 Numerous observation patient undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplant hematological malignancy convincingly demonstrate evidence graft-versus-disease ( GVD ) effect mediate lymphocytes present donor graft . Supportive evidence importance phenomenon include : 1 ) relapse rate syngeneic BMT recipient great allogeneic recipient ; 2 ) allogeneic BMT recipient develop graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) significantly great relapse rate allogeneic BMT-recipients develop GVHD ; 3 ) complete remission observe patient relapsed disease allogeneic BMT association flare GVHD ; 4 ) recipient T-cell deplete BMT , method GVHD prophylaxis , relapse frequently recipients non-T-cell depleted BMT ; 5 ) use unrelated marrow graft non-T-cell deplete T-cell deplete allogeneic BMT associate reduced incidence relapse . The direct evidence role allogeneic lymphocytes mediate antitumor effect patient experience relapse follow allogeneic transplantation may successfully treat infusion donor leukocytes.15-22 Summarizing European experience , Kolb et al report 80 % patient CML relapse chronic phase follow transplant may achieve second complete remission infusion donor leukocytes infusion treat relapse CML follow transplant . Complete remission use DLI treatment relapse acute leukemia , chronic lymphocytic leukemia , myelodysplastic syndrome , multiple myeloma , polycythemia vera , although low see CML , well demonstrated several group . Additionally , potent graft versus disease effect associate allogeneic transplantation donor leukocyte infusion observe patient non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma multiple myeloma.23-25 Thus , allogeneic transplantation offer uniquely effective approach eradicate hematological malignancy myeloablative therapy result profound tumor cytoreduction donor lymphocytes subsequently eliminate minimal residual disease via immunological mechanism . Limitations Application Allogeneic Transplantation The use allogeneic BMT limit significant treatment related morbidity mortality associate procedure . Patients often experience significant organ dysfunction result regimen relate toxicity . Moderate severe graft versus host disease occur approximately 40 % patient undergo match sibling conventional transplant increase incidence old patient receive unrelated mismatch grafts.26-28 Opportunistic infection due immune dysfunction remain major source morbidity mortality particularly old patient . The application allogeneic transplantation therefore restrict young patient normal underlying organ function . Because median age many hematological malignancy may exceed 60 year age , majority patient disorder consider candidate procedure . The difficulty apply allogeneic transplantation patient hematological malignancy particularly highlight patient lymphoid malignancy multiple myeloma , chronic lymphocytic leukemia low-grade lymphoma . These disorder incurable standard dose chemotherapy may follow relatively indolent course several year patient develop progressive chemoresistant disease . Allogeneic transplantation associate long-term disease free survival setting associate high incidence upfront transplant relate mortality . Strategies limit transplant related toxicity essential translate decrease incidence relapse improvement overall survival patient population . Nonmyeloablative Allogeneic Transplantation One approach limit toxicity allogeneic transplantation use nonmyeloablative regimen precede infusion allogeneic cells.29-33 With strategy , patient receive immunosuppressive therapy allow engraftment donor cell without immediate eradication patient hematopoiesis . The primary mechanism underlie disease eradicate chemotherapy-mediated cytoreduction , rather donor lymphocyte mediate graft versus tumor effect . As result , patient experience far less regimen related toxicity . Therefore , adoption strategy may allow use allogeneic transplantation disease setting patient population readily applicable past . Over past several year , use nonmyeloablative transplant rapidly expand . Several reduced intensity conditioning regimen develop include fludarabine cyclophosphamide ; fludarabine melphalan ; fludarabine , anti-thymocyte globulin low dose busulfan ; fludarabine low dose TBI . Investigators demonstrate feasibility treatment approach majority patient demonstrate donor engraftment , decrease regimen related toxicity , graft mediate regression disease . In study , patient demonstrate period mixed donor/host chimerism infusion donor lymphocytes associate achievement complete donor chimerism . Although regimen related toxicity decrease follow reduce intensive conditioning regimen , graft versus host disease opportunistic infection remain significant source morbidity mortality follow nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplantation . The impact nonmyeloablative transplantation immunological reconstitution fully define . Persistence host antigen present cell post-transplant period may increase incidence GVHD due presentation alloantigens donor T cell . In contrast , residual host cellular immunity may provide enhanced protection infectious pathogen allow rapid education donor lymphocytes . Of note , CMV infection remain common population present later post-transplant period characteristically follow attainment full donor chimerism.34 Nonmyeloablative Allogeneic Transplantation Conjunction CAMPATH Therapy One approach reduce incidence GVHD follow nonmyeloablative transplantation addition CAMPATH preparative regimen deplete T cell recipient incoming graft.35 CAMPATH-1H ( Alemtuzumab ) recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal antibody direct cell surface glycoprotein , CD52 ; produce mammalian cell ( Chinese hamster ovary ) suspension.36-39 Campath-1H indicate treatment B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient treat alkylating agent fail fludarabine therapy . Campath-1H use patient autoimmune neutropenia , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , rheumatoid arthritis , vasculitis . It also use prevent graft-versus-host disease patient receive stem cell transplantation . GVHD prophylaxis cyclosporin A alone . Mackinnon et al investigated nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen 47 patient hematological malignancy receive allogeneic bone marrow stem cell match , unrelated donors.40 The majority patient high-risk feature , include fail prior transplantation ( 29 individual ) . Twenty transplant mismatch HLA class I and/or class II allele . They add CAMPATH-1H preparative regimen fludarabine melphalan administer either GCSF mobilize peripheral blood stem unmanipulated bone marrow match unrelated donor . Primary graft failure occur 2 44 evaluable patient ( 4.5 % ) . Chimerism study 34 patient indicated majority ( 85.3 % ) attain initial full donor chimerism . Only 3 patient develop grade III IV acute GVHD , patient yet develop chronic extensive GVHD . The estimated probability nonrelapse mortality day 100 14.9 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 4.7 % -25.1 % ) . With median follow-up 344 day ( range , 79-830 ) , overall progression-free survival 1 year 75.5 % ( 95 % CI , 62.8 % -88.2 % ) 61.5 % ( 95 % CI , 46.1 % -76.8 % ) , respectively . It subsequently report significant subset patient demonstrate evidence CMV reactivation.41 However , presence CMV negatively impact survival . While investigator note need long follow-up cohort , felt preparative regimen incorporate vivo CAMPATH-1H associate durable engraftment minimal treatment related toxicity . Immune Reconstitution Following Allogeneic Transplantation Allogeneic transplantation associate period immune dysfunction characteristically persist least 1 year post-transplant.42,43 Immune recovery dependent reconstitution element humoral cellular immunity reeducation transplant recipient . It particularly delay recipient unrelated T cell deplete graft . The post-transplant period characterize decreased level helper T cell , associate inversion C4 : CD8 ratio , blunt T cell responses mitogenic stimulus recall antigens.44-46 Humoral immune dysfunction associate loss protective antibody level bacterial viral pathogen , decrease level circulate immunoglobulin particularly IgG2 subtype , reduce complexity pattern immunoglobulin gene rearrangement.47,48 Dendritic Cells Immune Reconstitution The nature recovery antigen present cell dendritic cell likely play essential role reconstitution posttransplant immunity host/donor tolerance . Dendritic cell ( DC ) form complex network antigen presenting cell play vital role induction primary immunity well modulation tolerance.49.50 DC potent antigen present cell uniquely able induce primary immune response novel antigen rich expression costimulatory adhesion molecule . DC generate nonmyeloid lineage immature state may mediate immune tolerance direct T cell response towards TH2 phenotype . Distinct DC population identify peripheral blood differentiate presence myeloid ( CD11c ) plasmacytoid ( CD123 ) markers.51,52 DC2 ( plasmacytoid ) cell characterize expression type 2 cytokine thus initiate Th2 response , whereas DC1 ( myeloid ) cell initiate Th1 cytokine response . DC isolate patient malignancy demonstrate functional deficiency potentially contribute lack tumor recognition host immunity . Little known DC engraftment phenotypic functional characteristic allogeneic transplantation . The interaction DC effector population likely unique follow nonmyeloablative condition give presence mixed donor/recipient chimerism may characterize post-transplant period . In murine model , Shlomchik et al demonstrate persistence host antigen present cell post-transplant associate development GVHD.53 In model , host DC capable present minor histocompatibility antigen infuse donor T-cells potentially initiate T-cell activation associate Th-1 cytokine cascade implicate pathogenesis aGVHD . The relative level DC1/DC2 subsets hematopoietic graft strongly correlate incidence graft versus host disease incidence relapse . G-CSF mediate stem mobilization associate increased level DC2 populations.54 In animal model , infusion splenocytes bone marrow donor treat G-CSF associate emergence DC2 phenotype , thus , tolerance.55 In one study patient undergo allogeneic transplantation , presence increase number DC2 cell hematopoietic graft associate decrease GVHD , increase relapse poorer outcomes.56 The impact DC chimerism , pattern reconstitution , presence DC1 DC2 population follow nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplantation well study . Recent study demonstrate CD52 express DC population suggest CAMPATH therapy may impact antigen presentation depletion DC population host.57-59 Depletion host derive DC may decrease incidence GVHD , presence donor DC likely essential reconstitution cellular immunity . In proposed study , intend examine application CAMPATH base preparative regimen patient hematological malignancy undergo nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation unrelated donor . The study involve patient would otherwise candidate conventional myeloablative conditioning regimen age organ dysfunction HLA-matched sibling donor . It also include patient suffer lymphoid malignancy low-grade lymphoma , CLL , multiple myeloma experience unacceptably high transplant relate mortality conventional allogeneic transplantation . Inclusion myeloid lymphoid hematological malignancy study cohort optimize accrual limit ability ability pursue study goal . Patterns engraftment , graft versus host disease , immune reconstitution , donor/host chimerism primarily determine preparative regimen transplant strategy differ considerably within patient cohort . For condition regimen , choose intermediate dose cyclophosphamide fludarabine attempt minimize incidence graft rejection without increase frequency treatment related morbidity mortality . Based work MacKinnon et al , add CAMPATH-1H preparative regimen decrease incidence GVHD promote donor stem cell engraftment . Following regimen circulate level CAMPATH present several week post-transplant may excessively deplete donor T cell well eliminate DC population donor graft . In effort improve post-transplant immune reconstitution limit risk infection relapse , choose low dose CAMPATH follow level serial time point post-transplant . The principal endpoint trial include defining : 1 ) treatment related toxicity profile post-transplant hematopoietic recovery 2 ) incidence severity CMV infection acute chronic GVHD 3 ) phenotypic functional characteristic DC T cell population post-transplant ; 4 ) pattern donor/host chimerism DC T cell population correlation GVHD . As secondary endpoint , 1 2 year DFS OS determine .</detailed_description>
