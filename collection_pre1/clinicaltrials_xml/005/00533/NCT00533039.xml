	<brief_summary>As evidence accumulates atherogenesis Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) may simply disorder lipid metabolism , inflammatory disease , focus treatment shift . A-002 Varespladib anti-inflammatory drug treatment chronic acute disease . It act inhibit secretory phospholipase A2 ( sPLA2 ) - one family enzymes lead inflammation - may important : 1 ) development atherosclerosis 2 ) increase occurence cardiovascular event angioplasty . Previous study demonstrate sPLA2 : 1 ) facilitate pro-atherogenic effect low-density ( LDL bad cholesterol ) 2 ) increase level post-angioplasty correlate increase risk event followup contact . Therefore study propose investigate ability A-002 prevent reduce myocardial damage angioplasty inhibiting cascade inflammatory mediator . Substudy - Subjects agree also vascular ultrasound 24h post-PCI ass endothelial function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tissue injury angioplasty likely due micro-emboli mechanical trauma thrombotic lesion angioplasty . In response ischemia sPLA2 , possibly localize within atherosclerotic vascular tissue well macrophages monocyte , release . Following ischemia-induced release , sPLA2 bind ischemically challenge cardiomyocytes adversely affect survival either directly toxic effect cardiomyocytes indirectly facilitating inflammation . It may possible sPLA2 inhibition salvage non-lethally jeopardized cell follow ischemic episode thereby reduce infarcted area amount tissue damage . Previous study patient unstable angina support hypothesis , conclude sPLA2 level use predict clinical outcome . We hypothesize sPLA2 inhibition A-002 reduce myocardial injury post-angioplasty . Substudy - Peripheral vascular ultrasound do prior receive study drug 24h post-PCI . Coronary endothelial function assess time PCI .</detailed_description>
