	<brief_title>Exercise Intervention Female School Children : Effect Blood Pressure , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , Maths Scores</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Primary Objective : To compare effect 6 month healthy physical activity blood pressure female school child ( 9-13 yr ) routine physical activity - Secondary objective : To compare effect 6 month healthy physical activity body mass index math score routine physical activity - Study Design : It would non-randomized experimental study ( community intervention trial ) . It design test effectiveness exercise reduce blood pressure effect BMI math score - Setting : The study would conduct 4 public sector school Karachi . - Study Population : The study population would select 4 local public sector school near hospital , The Aga Khan University Hospital .

The routine activity group similar session baseline . - Sampling technique : convenience sample - Sample Size : A sample size 126 ( 63 arm ) achieve 80 % power detect difference 4.3 mm systolic blood pressure null hypothesis mean 110.3 alternative hypothesis mean 105.7 estimate standard deviation 9.7 significance level ( alpha ) 0.05 use one side one sample test . Assuming could 10 % dropout rate plan take total sample size 140 student . We multiply total sample size 2 account design effect cluster ( school ) achieve total sample size 280 140 arm . - Dependent variable outcome variable : Primary outcome measure would blood pressure . Secondary outcome measure would body composition include weight , BMI , central obesity , math score . Independent variable would demographic ( age , school class ) intervention healthy physical activity measurement food intake frequency</detailed_description>
