	<brief_summary>Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa ( RDEB ) severe inherit blistering skin disease cause absence type VII collagen . Patients RDEB develop large , severly painful blister open wound minor trauma skin . In future , hope start gene transfer study specific group RDEB subject screen subject potential trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Screening Possible Gene Transfer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study preparation gene transfer trial . In gene transfer trial , transfect autologous RDEB keratinocytes type VII collagen contain retrovirus vector . We plan graft genetically engineer correct autologous keratinocytes back wound RDEB subject . We expect grafts attach normal keratinocytes replace damage skin skin able make type VII collagen anchor normally dermis . We try define number subject 18 old meet criterion gene transfer trial . We offer subject opportunity evaluate potential trial .</detailed_description>
