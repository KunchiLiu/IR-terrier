	<detailed_description>Intravascular device integral component modern-day medical practice . They use administer intravenous fluid , medication , blood product parenteral nutrition . In addition , serve valuable monitor hemodynamic status critically ill patient . Infection one lead complication intravascular catheter associate increased mortality , prolonged hospitalization increase medical cost . Central venous catheter ( CVCs ) account estimate 90 % catheter-related bloodstream infection ( CRBSI ) . A host risk factor CVC-related infection document . This include , importantly , duration catheterization . The duration use CVCs remain controversial length time device safely leave situ fully objectively address critically ill patient . As consequence , schedule replacement remain widely practice many Intensive Care Units ( ICUs ) , mean time recent study mainland Britain , 6.5 days.Over past year , antimicrobial impregnate catheter introduce attempt limit catheter-related infection ( CRI ) increase time CVCs safely leave place.Recent meta-analyses conclude antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs appear effective reduce CRI.The topic remain extremely controversial differ viewpoint appear literature . This prospective randomize double-blind study perform multidisciplinary ICU Johannesburg Hospital , Johannesburg , South Africa four year period . The study include 118 critically ill patient entail comparison 14-day placement standard triple-lumen central venous catheter ( ARROW Standard Triple Lumen Catheter , Arrow International Inc. , Reading , PA , US ) versus antimicrobial impregnated catheter ( chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine ) ( ARROWgard Triple Lumen Catheter , Arrow International Inc. , Reading , PA , US ) rate CRI . The aim : 1 . Determine whether duration catheter insertion time could safely increased standard practice seven day fourteen day 2 . To assess influence antimicrobial impregnate catheter incidence CRI 3 . To evaluate previously record risk factor CRI , well 4 . Elucidate epidemiology CRI . The randomization protocol involve equal number two type non-distinguishable catheter mixed consignment select consecutive fashion placement study candidate . Consent obtain prior enrollment study . Standard infection control measure practice catheter insertion . Skin swab take culture prior cleanse chlorhexidine contain solution subsequent catheter insertion . Catheters inspect dressed daily , study colonization CRBSI removal . The origin CRBSI seek culture potential source ( skin , catheter segment , hubs infusates ) . A semiquantitative culture catheter use roll-plate technique perform DNA-molecular type employed assist microbiological analysis . All relevant clinical data collect evaluated . CRI define accord criterion propose Centers Disease Control Prevention USA . The study approve Committee Research Human Subjects University Witwatersrand .</detailed_description>
