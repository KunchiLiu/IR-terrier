	<brief_summary>Severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) viral illness affect respiratory ( breathe ) system . The purpose study evaluate safety protective ( immune ) responses different dos SARS vaccine give without adjuvant . An adjuvant substance may add vaccine improve immune response less vaccine may need give . Study participant include 72 volunteer , age 18-40 , living Houston , Texas area . The study take place Baylor College Medicine . Participants receive 2 injection vaccine placebo ( substance make look like study vaccine contain medication ) give 1 month apart . Participants fill memory aid ( diary ) document daily temperature illness sign symptoms 7-9 day injection . During 9 study visit , several blood sample collect . Participants study 211 day , include screening .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Severe acute respiratory disease ( SARS ) recently emerge infectious disease first recognize Guangdong Province , China , November 2002 . Efforts prevent spread virus stop epidemic July , 2003 , 8,000 case occur almost 800 people die . A new virus , coronavirus , show cause believe virus bat infect animal , turn , infected people give people . While unlikely become epidemic , virus thought risk spread human release intentionally terrorist group . For reason , U.S. government develop vaccine drug use spread occur . This study test safety protective response vaccine SARS make vaccine company study . This protocol concern Phase I clinical test inactivate , purified SARS Coronavirus ( CoV ) vaccine administer without aluminum hydroxide ( Alum ) adjuvant . The rationale development vaccine SARS-CoV provide mean control event new SARS-CoV epidemic occurs deliberate release virus . Inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine show induce neutralize antibody block bind virus receptor , ACE2 . The primary objective study ass : reactogenicity escalate dos adjuvanted non-adjuvanted , inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine among healthy young adult subject give first intramuscular ( IM ) vaccination vaccine ; reactogenicity repeat IM administration material healthy young adult subject one month later ; development persistence immune response escalate dos adjuvanted non-adjuvanted , inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine 1 5 month second ( `` booster '' ) vaccination . The secondary objective study ass immune response vaccine 1 month single dose . This single center , Phase I , out-patient study reactogenicity ( tolerability safety ) immunogenicity escalate dos inactivate SARS-CoV vaccine without aluminum hydroxide adjuvant . Each vaccine inject primary booster vaccination month apart subject 's non-dominant deltoid muscle . Participants include 72 healthy male non-pregnant , non-lactating female , 18-40 year old Houston , Texas area . The study conduct Baylor College Medicine 2 sequential stage . This study consist preliminary dose-escalation stage ( 1.a , 1.b , 1.c ) follow dose comparison stage ( 2 ) follow : Stage 1a ( 2.5 mcg ) , 7 subject randomize 1:3:3 fashion receive 2 dose regimen placebo , vaccine contain 2.5 mcg antigen adjuvant , 2.5 mcg antigen Alum adjuvant ; Stage 1b ( 5.0 mcg ) , 7 subject randomize 1:3:3 fashion receive 2 dose regimen placebo , vaccine contain 5.0 mcg antigen adjuvant , 5.0 mcg antigen Alum adjuvant ; Stage 1c ( 10.0 mcg ) , 4 subject randomize 1:3 fashion receive 2 dose regimen placebo vaccine 10 mcg antigen adjuvant ; Stage 2 , 54 subject ( 9 per vaccine group ) randomize 1:1:1:1:1:1 receive vaccine contain , 2.5 , 5.0 , 10.0 mcg antigen without adjuvant , 2.5 5.0 mcg antigen Alum , placebo .</detailed_description>
