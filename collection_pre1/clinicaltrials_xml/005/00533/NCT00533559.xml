	<brief_summary>An increase plasma free fatty acid impairs insulin secretion insulin sensitivity , thereby play important role cause type 2 diabetes . Lipotoxicity play important role progression normal glucose tolerance fast hyperglycemia coversion frank type 2 diabetes . A recent publication journal Science show buphenyl , give obese diabetic mouse , result normalization hyperglycemia , restoration systemic insulin sensitivity , resolution fatty liver disease inhancement insulin action liver , muscle adipose tissue . mechanism action believe due reduction endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress . Buphenyl currently approve treatment rare inherit disorder urea cycle . We plan administer Buphenyl orally humans dose far low use treatment urea cycle disorder 2 week prior test pancreatic function . One potential mechanism whereby chromically elevate plasma FFAs glucose impairment beta cell function insuln sensitivity ER stress prevent administeration buphenyl .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanism Fatty Acid-induced Impairment Glucose-simulated Insulin Secretion - Effect Buphenyl</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each subject undergo 4 study , 4 week apart . Each study consist 2 week treatment period either Buphenyl placebo , follow 48 hour hospital stay test insulin sensitivity insulin secretion . The four study follow : 1 . 2-week placebo tablet follow hospital 48-hour infusion normal saline prior test insulin secretion insulin sensitivity ( CONTROL study ) , 2 . 2-week placebo treatment follow 48 hour infusion intralipid heparin raise plasma free fatty acid 2-fold prior test insulin secretion insulin sensitivity ( PLACEBO-INTRALIPID+HEPARIN study ) , 3 . 2-week Buphenyl treatment follow 48-hr infusion intralipid heparin raise plasma free fatty acid 2-fold prior test insulin secretion insulin sensitivity ( BUPOHENYL+INTRALIPID+HEPARIN study ) , 4 . 2-week Buphenyl treatment follow 48-hr infusion normal saline prior test insulin secretion insulin sensitivity ( BUPHENYL+SALINE study ) . For two week prior admission hospital hospital admission subject ingest 5 tablet 3 time per day meal ( total 15 tablet per day ) . For two 4 study tablet contain Buphenyl ( total 15 tablet per day , tablet Buphenyl contain 500mg , total 7.5grams per day ) , whereas two study tablet placebo , contain active ingredient . The study conduct single blind study , subject know whether receive placebo biphenyl . For safety reason since influence result study conduct double blind study . On four occasion , 4 week apart , take tablet 2 week , subject fast overnight 12-hours prior admission Toronto General Hospital metabolic research ward 48 hour undergo test follow . On morning admit intravenous ( iv ) line place superficial vein ( skin ) forearm ( 2 iv 's , one iv arm ) . These intravenous line use blood sample regular interval throughout study infuse solution . Blood sample draw painlessly IV time interval first two day . The total amount blood take three study period less 250 ml per visit i.e . le amount give donate blood ( total amount 1,000 ml entire study , usually take 4 month complete ) . During two four admission hospital receive 48-hour infusion intralipid ( 40 ml/hr 20 % fat solution ) Heparin ( 250U/hr ) ) raise plasma FFAs approximately 2-fold previously describe ( 8 ; 54 ) whereas two occasion receive infusion saline ( salt water ) 48 hour hospital . Heparin stimulate important enzyme involve breakdown fat particle ( lipoprotein lipase ) use purpose study . Intralipid fat emulsion supply synthetic triglyceride substrate LPL order raise plasma FFAs . Subjects permit eat drink provide regular low fat meal 48 hour study .</detailed_description>
