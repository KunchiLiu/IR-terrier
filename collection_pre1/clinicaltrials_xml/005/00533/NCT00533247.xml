	<detailed_description>Abstract : This double blind , placebo control , study seek determine efficacy preoperative anti-inflammatory therapy reduction postoperative pain knee arthroplasty surgery . Pre-emptive use NSAIDS demonstrate modest reduction post-operative pain previous study . However , short duration dose study capitalize anti-inflammatory property NSAIDS . Short-term use NSAIDS provide pain relief address inflammation . Traditional NSAIDS use preoperatively due platelet effect . Celecoxib , however , analgesic anti-inflammatory , interfere bleed . It therefore safely use surgery . This study hypothesize use celecoxib seven day preoperatively reduce postoperative inflammation consequently pain . A detailed Medline search identify study preoperative use NSAID dose level achieves anti-inflammatory effects.If effective reduce postoperative pain , research could lead new understanding role inflammation play orthopedic procedure elective procedure thus improve patient outcomes future . Purpose Significance : It commonly accept inflammation significantly increase pain . To date , study examine potential benefit preemptively treat inflammation surgery . While analgesic effect NSAIDs rapid onset , maximal anti-inflammatory effect take one three week realize . Due bleeding concern , traditional NSAIDS naprosyn ibuprofen , , use preoperatively . Following surgery , inflammatory cascade cell chemical mediator inundate surgical wound create acute inflammation . Once happen NSAIDs miss opportunity treat acute inflammation . Post-operative single dose preoperative use NSAIDs act exclusively analgesic . Since celecoxib impact postoperative bleeding , safely administer preoperatively . With adequate time elective operation , one opportunity reach steady state pharmacokinetics sufficient serum level prevent inflammation -- therefore pain Aims Study : 1 . Compare efficacy seven-day preoperative course celecoxib 200mg take orally daily efficacy single preoperative 200mg dose administer day operation reduce postoperative pain . Endpoints : Primary Endpoint : Comparison total pain rating group receive seven day preoperative celecoxib total pain rating group receive single dose celecoxib . Total Pain calculate sum ten point verbal rating scale ( VRS ) time interval : `` When woke follow surgery , '' 24 hour postoperatively 48 hour postoperatively . Additional endpoint : 1 . Comparison pain rating VRS `` When woke follow surgery , '' 24 hour 48 hour postoperatively two study group 2 . Comparison patient report maximum pain VRS study group . Methods : Study Size 50 Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty receive celecoxib 200mg daily seven day preoperatively 50 Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty receive placebo daily six day preoperatively day operation receive single dose celecoxib 200mg . In order able detect difference 2 point 0-10 scale either intervention group placebo group , 80 % power ( 5 % 2 side significance level assume SD 3.5 ) 50 subject per group would sufficient . That detectible difference combine assume SD equivalent moderate large effect size ( i.e . one clinically relevant ) . Selection Recruitment Participants Consecutive patient schedule knee arthroplasty surgery meet study inclusion criterion would enrol randomize either seven day course group single dose/placebo group . Randomization do via seal , cod study package include either medication placebo . These package dispense patient Physicians recruit patient dispense study information brochure . If patient interested participating , study nurse contact provide full study detail obtain informed consent . Exclusion Criteria - Subjects exclude study follow reason : - Allergy non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication - Subjects must take another NSAID study conduct - Bleeding disorder - Impaired renal function ( serum creatinine &gt; 1.2 x upper limit normal ) - Liver Disease ( SGPT ( ALT ) SGOT ( AST ) &gt; 1.5x upper limit normal ) - Heart Disease - Ulcers - Taking ACE inhibitor - Taking diuretic - Must take NSAID daily basis study period - Pregnant plan start pregnancy soon Medication Dose Celecoxib begin act analgesic within minute oral administration . Anti-inflammatory efficacy NSAIDS show latency one two week . Ibuprofen , example require dose 1200mg/day ( maximum counter dose ) reach peak anti-inflammatory efficacy 7-14 day . For NSAIDS , anti-inflammatory dosing high level analgesic dosing . Celecoxib reach steady state five day . To ensure study achieves steady state level celecoxib serum , act anti-inflammatory rather analgesic one two-week time frame need . To improve patient compliance , daily dose 200mg select twice daily . Pain Assessment Pain assessment make prepared pain form contain visual pain scale . Data collect patient pain diary report researcher via toll-free phone number . The study nurse also contact patient directly study interval ensure collection data . Data Collection Data collection do telephone conversation patient return home surgery recover . Patients ask report pain ten-point scale . The scale described patient `` zero pain ten worst pain imaginable . '' Patients diary dispense ask telephone toll free number appropriate time . Additionally , study nurse call patient study data collection interval ( i.e `` When woke follow surgery , '' 24 hour 48 hour ) ensure data collection . Patients also ask state number indicate bad pain experience postoperative period - asked/recorded 48 hour postoperative interval . Statistical Analysis Study data analyze independent statistician .</detailed_description>
