	<detailed_description>Critical limb ischemia frequent situation whose incidence evaluate 500 1,000 per million per year . Limb salvage main goal therapy usually attempt surgical percutaneous vascularization procedure . However approximately 25 % patient suitable procedure estimate less half patient alive without major amputation 6 month . In set cell therapy propose stimulate angiogenesis . The first significant experience human report TATEISHI-YUYAMA et al show autologous implantation bone marrow mononuclear cell ( BM-MNC ) safe increase blood flow ischemic limb result clinical improvement . The author observe efficacy peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PB-MNC ) . Subsequently publication report positive effect PB-MNC harvest previous treatment haematopoietic growth factor induce mobilization stem cell . However treatment could deleterious effect patient present advanced arterial disease . In context propose prospective bi-centric trial evaluate safety efficacy autologous implantation either BM-MNC PB-MNC without previous mobilization hematopoïetic factor , patient critical limb ischemia . The trial design two step : first series eight patient treat BM-MNC follow eight receive PB-MNC . An interim analysis plan first sixteen case . Based analysis , decide include 12 patient type cells.Patients consecutively include soon present appropriate criterion select receive one another type cell . Before implantation , MNC count , differential viability determine . CD34+ , CD34+/CD133+ CD34+/CD133+/flk-1+ cell count flow-cytometry . Clinical symptom TcPO2 monitor 1 , 2 , 7 14 day , 1 , 3 , 6 month cell implantation . Blood cell count , C-reactive protein , Interleukin-6 , tumor necrosis factor-α , myoglobin , creatinin-kinase determine day 0 , 1 , 3 7 ; blood vascular-endothelial-growth-factor ( VEGF ) level CD34+ , CD34+/CD133+ blood cell measure 72 hour implantation</detailed_description>
