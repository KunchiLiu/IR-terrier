	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate transmission hantavirus Chile . It observational study look close household contact people diagnose hantavirus infection result serious illness see frequently become infected . Subjects enroll study donate sample body fluid ( e.g. , blood , saliva , stool , urine , respiratory vaginal secretion ) allow researcher see hantavirus present fluid , much . Subjects also interview identify household condition may associate transmission . Up 76 index case ( people first diagnose hantavirus cadiopulmonary illness ) 140 close contact enrol . Subjects follow 6 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome ( HCPS ) case fatality rate 40-50 percent . Andes virus ( ANDV ) primary pathogen Chile Argentina . This prospective observational study access incidence risk factor associate transmission HCPS close household contact HCPS index case include examination shed virus various body fluid factor transmissibility . The study enroll 76 cardiopulmonary syndrome HCPS index case 140 close household contact , age 2 old , risk contract HCPS . The index case participate initial visit ; household contact participant follow 35 day . The primary objective study : estimate secondary attack rate hantavirus infection among close household contact HCPS case one incubation period follow ; use personal interview questionnaires assess compare risk activity demographic factor close household contact develop HCPS contact identify specific high-risk activity exposure saliva respiratory secretion ; use personal interview questionnaires assess compare risk activity demographic factor index case ( first case household ) versus household contact develop HCPS ; determine prevalence hantavirus various body fluid index patient HCPS household contact acquire infection consequently determine association presence virus body fluid phase infection . Both infectious virus ( culture ) viral genomic RNA ( quantitative RT-PCR ) measure . The secondary objective study : determine quantity hantavirus various body fluid index patient HCPS household contact acquire infection consequently determine association presence virus body fluid phase infection . Both infectious virus ( culture ) viral genomic RNA ( quantitative RT-PCR ) measure ; develop predictive statistical model epidemiological virological variable ( culture , ANDV antibody , PCR , neutralize antibody , HSV 1 2 antibody ) could score use predict new case within household group ; determine feasibility rapid viral diagnostic test determine whether virologic result obtain sufficiently advance onset illness permit effective triage patient indeed develop HCPS ; determine sequence ANDV index additional case establish extent sequence identity virus within outside family cluster . The primary endpoint study : determine incidence additional case hantavirus ( ANDV ) among close household contact confirm index case complete incubation period follow ; evaluate risk activity demographic factor associate increase risk transmission ANDV index case member households respective index case ; measure risk activity demographic factor associate increase risk acquisition ANDV environmental source compare index case household contact develop HCPS ; determine presence virus measure viral RNA body fluid time index case additional case household contact . The secondary endpoint : determine sensitive culture approach detection ANDV body fluid different stage infection ; identify best model predict occurrence additional case within family group ; evaluate nucleotide similarity ancillary marker enrich de-enrich probability person person transmission AND virus . The duration study expect 3 year .</detailed_description>
