	<brief_summary>Preeclampsia common disease state occur third trimester pregnancy , incidence approximately 5-10 % US . Hypertension ( high blood pressure ) , primary symptom pre-eclampsia , may present woman hypertensive prior become pregnant.B-type ( also know brain ) natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) know make release heart ventricle heart strain . There also evidence BNP secrete placenta , may increase preeclampsia chronic hypertension pregnancy.The purpose study determine maternal blood sample analyze quantity BNP helpful differentiate pre-eclampsia chronic high blood pressure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Determine Serum BNP Levels Are Elevated Pregnant Women With Pre-Eclampsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preeclampsia frequent complication pregnancy . The chief concern preeclampsia may progress end-organ damage , resultant deterioration mother fetus . As result , woman significant preeclampsia may labor accelerate even require caesarian section . The diagnosis make base constellation non-specific symptom , include headache , vision change , proteinuria , hypertension . The diagnosis become even difficult establish patient chronic hypertension prior pregnancy . In many Emergency Departments across country , emergency physician face patient either sporadic non-existent prenatal care . Patients may often know blood pressure pregnancy . Records may exist available emergency physician make accurate decision . Patients often transfer tertiary care center obstetrical admission diagnosis unclear , outlying area increasingly without obstetrical coverage . The availability sensitive specific test presence preeclampsia , gestational hypertension superimpose chronic hypertension , would allow emergency physician avoid costly hospital admission transfer provide safe effective care patient . B-type brain type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) 32-amino acid peptide secrete primarily cardiac ventricle condition ventricular wall strain . In addition , demonstrate BNP also secrete human amnion pregnancy . Small study international literature suggest serum BNP elevate preeclamptic patient patient chronic hypertension pregnancy . A novel fluorescent immunoassay technique , Biosite Triage BNP assay , utilizes murine fluorescent label antibody detect quantify serum BNP level . The Triage assay design clinical use , estimate laboratory turnaround time fifteen minute ( Biosite Triage BNP product insert ) . The Triage assay gain acceptance highly sensitive specific tool assist rapid diagnosis congestive heart failure exacerbation ; utility preeclamptic population assess .</detailed_description>
