	<brief_summary>In patient acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) , high proportion suffer inflammation large bowel ( colitis ) intensive treatment . As standard treatment available potentially lifethreatening condition , investigator focus role parenteral nutrition patient inevitably require . Preclinical clinical data show strong anti-inflammatory property fish oil preparation contain poly-unsaturated omega3 fatty acid ( PUFA ) oppose lipid fraction . There may therapeutic benefit add omega3 PUFA standard nutrition patient chemotherapy-induced colitis . In small phase II study , investigator address effectiveness approach reduce incidence severity colitis AML patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Experimental clinical data attribute multiple anti-inflammatory effect diet enrich omega-3 PUFA containing oil , mainly FO . These effect mediate active metabolite , EPA- DHA-derived eicosanoids , antagonize predominantly pro-inflammatory derivates omega-6 PUFA origin . In cardiovascular disease data support several large-scale trial , also grow evidence beneficial effect omega-3 PUFA rich diet GI condition postoperative trauma inflammatory bowel disease . AML patient neutropenic colitis suffer condition pathophysiologically closely related studied disease . It therefore reasonable raise question whether cohort would equally benefit novel nutritional regimen enrich omega-3 PUFA . The propose pilot study address question clinical value add omega-3 PUFA contain lipid emulsion TPN regimen regard protection colitis ≥ °3 ( primary objective ) . A numerical cutoff provide support decision whether investigation warrant intervention consider promising . Target accrual n=35 patient receive TPN . An interim analysis perform n1=13 patient evaluable primary endpoint . The result interim analysis determine whether continuation trial interest trial stop . The sample size calculate use Simon 's two-stage minimax design .</detailed_description>
