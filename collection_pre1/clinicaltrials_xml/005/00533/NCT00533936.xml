	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving combination chemotherapy together trastuzumab surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving trastuzumab surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . Sometimes , surgery , tumor may need treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . It yet know whether trastuzumab effective observation give combination chemotherapy trastuzumab treat patient breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study trastuzumab see well work compare observation give combination chemotherapy trastuzumab treat patient undergo surgery stage II stage III breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trastuzumab Observation After Combination Chemotherapy Trastuzumab Treating Patients Undergoing Surgery Stage II Stage III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine percentage pathological response patient stage II III breast cancer treat neoadjuvant therapy comprise fluorouracil , doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide follow trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) paclitaxel . - To compare disease-free survival patient treat adjuvant therapy comprise trastuzumab versus observation . Secondary - To measure overall survival 3 year patient . - To measure cardiac safety profile regimens patient . - To measure percentage patient become negative fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) test end neoadjuvant therapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : - Neoadjuvant therapy : Patients receive fluorouracil IV , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , cyclophosphamide IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) IV 30-90 minute paclitaxel IV 1 hour week 12 week . After completion neoadjuvant therapy , patient proceed surgery . - Surgery : Patients undergo definitive surgery . Some patient may also undergo radiotherapy* . NOTE : *Patients initial tumor &gt; 5 cm , inflammatory breast cancer , skin condition final pathological evaluation metastasis &gt; 4 node 1-3 node capsular rupture extension fatty tissue receive adjuvant radiotherapy . - Adjuvant therapy : Beginning 4 week surgery , patient receive trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 13 course . - Arm II : - Neoadjuvant therapy : Patients receive neoadjuvant therapy arm I . - Surgery : Patients undergo definitive surgery . Some patient may also undergo radiotherapy clinically indicate . - Observation : Beginning 4 week surgery , patient undergo observation . In arm , patient estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive disease also receive anastrozole daily 5 year . Premenopausal patient remain ovarian function ( confirm follicle-stimulating hormone [ FSH ] estradiol ) completion anastrozole undergo chemical surgical ovarian ablation . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , year thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 160 patient ( 80 per treatment arm ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
