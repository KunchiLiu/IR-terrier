	<brief_summary>This study evaluate immune system respond influenza infection compare infection differs patient weaken immune system versus healthy immune system . Patients NIH Clinical Center old 2 year age diagnose influenza A B may eligible study . Patients healthy immune system weaken immune system include . Participants answer question feel physical examination evaluate symptom . Blood nasal fluid collect first day every day total 8 day . Nasal fluid collect either insert small tube nose wash nose salt water collect fluid obtain , rub inside nose swab . Physical examination repeat day blood nasal fluid collect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Influenza virus cause significant morbidity year , past epidemic pandemic cause significant mortality . The impact influenza could increase number patient immunocompromised due acute chronic disease well immunosuppressive therapy largely unknown . Limited information available innate immune response influenza chronic illness immunosuppression may affect immune response virus comparison see normal host . We evaluate immunocompromised non-immunocompromised ( control group ) patient local community , Washington Hospital Center , NIH Clinical Center . Patients know suspected influenza evaluate record symptom , collect blood nasal fluid specimen , isolate virus . Each patient infection map perform genomic analysis viral isolates collect patient infection ( include analysis sequence know confer resistance antiviral medication ) , measure cytokine level blood nasal fluid , measure influenza-specific antibody response . Correlation result clinical symptom clinical outcome evaluate . Elucidation responses genomic change virus may undergo infection treatment influenza normal immunocompromised patient may help good understand impact influenza overall health patient , well strategy may perform good protect treat patient emergence new pandemic .</detailed_description>
