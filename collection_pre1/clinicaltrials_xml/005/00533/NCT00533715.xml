	<brief_summary>Spirometry test include expiratory inspiratory measurement may influence expiratory flow volume curve index . The ability inhale medication may judge inspiratory flow . However , inspiratory portion force flow/volume maneuver young healthy child yet described.Objectives : To document analyze forced inspiratory flow volume curve index healthy young child . Settings : Community kindergartens around Israel . participant ; Healthy preschool child ( age 2.5-6.5 year ) . Methods : The teach method include multi-target , interactive spirometry game ( SpiroGame® ) accessory game inspiration ( e.g . inspiratory whistle ) . Results : One hundred fourteen 157 child perform duplicate full adequate inspiratory maneuver . Repeatability two maneuver 5.6 % , 4.0 % , 5.1 % , 7.3 % inspiratory capacity ( IVC ) , force inspiratory capacity ( FIVC ) , peak inspiratory capacity ( PIF ) , mid inspiratory flow ( MIF50 ) , respectively . Inspiratory flow index significantly low parallel expiratory flow index time reach PIF significantly slow time reach peak expiratory flow ( meanSD ; 22921ms vs. 92 8ms ; p &lt; 0.0001 ) . The shape inspiratory curve parabolic change age . Predicted equation form agreement extrapolate prediction equation value old child . We find majority healthy young child produce reliable inspiratory curve . Our result provide framework reference equation inspiratory flow volume curve young age . The clinical application equation yet explore .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study protocol : The study include healthy child ( accord questionnaire ) early childhood . Any child previous symptom present treatment asthma , respiratory symptom ( cough , post nasal drip , pneumonia , rhinitis ) respiratory disease exclude study . Forced maneuver measure commercial spirometer , ZAN100 ( ZAN Messgerate , Oberthulba , Germany ) . The spirometer software include online analysis inspiratory expiratory maneuver . The curve monitor computer screen ensure best effort . The software also include incentive-guided spirometry game . Inspiratory index part game , therefore effort continue child could pass former inspiratory attempt . Healthy child perform test designate room kindergarten . Tests perform stand position without nose-clip . Maneuvers repeat obtain best possible effort least three technically acceptable maneuver . Technically acceptable curve store three consecutive curve maximal inspiratory maneuver analyze study .</detailed_description>
