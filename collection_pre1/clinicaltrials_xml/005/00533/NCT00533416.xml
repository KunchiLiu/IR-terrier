	<brief_summary>This study determine high dose experimental drug ON 01910.Na safely give patient bone marrow disorder myelodysplasia ( MDS ) patient refractory AML trisomy 8 . In disease , bone marrow make blood cell , cell release blood use body . ON 01910.Na experimental drug inhibits protein call cyclinD1that important keep MDS cell alive . In laboratory experiment , ON 01910.Na act cyclinD1 , cause MDS cell die . The study also evaluate body handle ON 01910.Na , effect drug MDS AML side effect . Patients 18 85 year old MDS AML suitable sibling donor marrow transplant willing transplant may eligible study . Participants receive ON 01910.Na 2-week treatment cycle , 3 5 day drug infusion vein follow 9 11 day observation . To find high safe dose ON 01910.Na , first person enrol study give small study dose drug 3 day , follow 2 week later second dose 3 day . If dos find safe , next two people receive dose . If subject well , next group patient receive next high dose level . The dose continue increase group 3 6 subject fourth high dose level reach . Patients well treatment may receive additional six cycle ON 01910.Na ( 3 5 day infusion every week 12 week ) . Before , treatment period , patient periodically evaluate monitor follow test procedure : - Physical examination review medical medication history . - Blood urine test . - Pregnancy test woman childbearing age . - Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) chest X-ray . - Bone marrow biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety ON 01910.Na Patients With Myelodysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) group heterogeneous disease wide variation clinical presentation disease severity . Typically patient old adult co-morbidities . AML MDS characterize variable degree cytopenias ( anemia , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia ) due ineffective hematopoiesis dysplastic bone marrow morphology hematological malignancy . Treatment MDS unsatisfactory : chemotherapy limit role management leukemic progression ; autologous stem cell transplantation prolong relapse-free survival stem cell transplantation poorly tolerate old individual . Some MDS patient show respond wide variety immunosuppressive agent range corticosteroid cyclosporine ( CsA ) horse antithymocyte globulin ( h-ATG ) . However , overall response rate le 30 % relapse continue problem . Few treatment appear change natural history MDS however , growth factor , decitabine , lenalidomide improve cytopenia , 5-azacytidine , reduce transfusion requirement , improve quality life compare supportive care . In addition MDS patient older tolerate aggressive therapy poorly . Some AML patient cure chemotherapy allogeneic stem cell transplantation . However standard treatment approach effective patient become refractory chemotherapy , elderly patient , relapse transplantation . The management MDS relapsed/refractory AML patient therefore remain unsatisfactory targeted therapy need . One investigational drug , ON 01910.Na , potent inhibitor cyclin D1 mitosis . ON01910.Na show activity broad spectrum tumor cell line . Animal model study show little toxicity high therapeutic index tumor . In addition , fact MDS bone marrow ( particularly trisomy 8 ) patient AML trisomy 8 abnormality ( Sloand , unpublished data ) over-express cyclin D1 vitro study demonstrate activity cytogenetically abnormal cell blast despite minimal inhibition normal hematopoiesis provide rationale use select patient MDS AML . We therefore propose non-randomized , pilot , dose escalate Phase I study ON 01910.Na MDS patient refractory AML trisomy 8 . The primary objective determine safety ( include maximum tolerate dose and/or dose regimen ) ON 01910.Na administer escalating dos select patient MDS AML . Secondary objective include plasma pharmacokinetics biological effect ON 01910.Na cell-cycle pathway MDS AML cell , bone marrow RNA analysis ass gene expression predict clinical response ON 01910.Na subject MDS . The primary endpoint toxicity profile dose level . Secondary endpoint include evaluation early evidence disease response blast cytogenetic improvement .</detailed_description>
