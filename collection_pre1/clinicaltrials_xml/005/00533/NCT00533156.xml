	<brief_title>Plug Arterial Closure System ( PACS , 7F )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Achieving hemostasis arterial puncture site percutaneous cardiac catheterization potential cause bleeding , hematoma , pseudoaneurysms , various vascular complication . Hemostasis femoral artery access site diagnostic interventional procedure typically achieve use either manual compression deployment vascular closure device . Manual compression time consume health-care provider , painful patient . In addition , prolong period immobilization bed rest may require . Vascular closure device develop avoid manual compression , shorten bed rest , allow early ambulation . The Ensure Medical Vascular Closure device ( VCD ) intend femoral artery puncture site closure patient undergone coronary catheterization use standard 7F introducer sheath . The device comprise bio-absorbable plug plug delivery system . The plug delivery system design position bio-absorbable plug extravascular surface femoral artery access site , facilitate hemostasis response . The Ensure Medical VCD study prior feasibility trial 149 patient utilize 6F introducer sheath , demonstrate : ( 1 ) device could use successfully obtain rapid hemostasis early ambulation patient undergoing catheterization procedure ; ( 2 ) low incidence relatively minor nature observe closure related complication suggest device safe intend purpose .</detailed_description>
