You also give special mailer return sample . The second study visit take 2 hour . After initial visit , ask come M. D. Anderson complete Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan evaluate body composition . At baseline study visit , randomly assign ( toss coin ) either weight gain prevention group standard care group . An equal number people assign group . If assign intervention group , attend individual in-person study visit M. D. Anderson receive instruction counsel exercise diet . While receive chemotherapy , attend 1 , 60-minute study visit per week 16 week . During visit , give instruction resistance flexibility exercise , use pedometer ( small device worn day give information number step take ) , make change diet . You practice exercise session , receive feedback . Some session might video tap . You ask give permission videotape session begin .

You ask permission tape-record session telephone counsel session begin . You receive write material make change diet exercise behavior . The write material information overcome barrier , reward , time management . You also receive hand weight , step , stability ball exercise home pedometer monitor walk . The hand weight , step , stability ball , pedometer keep . Based strength assessment , tailor resistance exercise prescribe . You exercise 3 time per week . The exercise target major muscle group . After recovered surgery , 1 study visit week 3 week . You practice exercise receive counsel encourage exercise eat accord dietary recommendation . The exercise may modify visit , necessary . After 3 week , receive 1 phone call week next 6 week . Each telephone call take 15-20 minute .

Anderson follow-up assessment mid-point end chemotherapy , recover surgery , 9 week 6 month surgery . You ask come M. D. Anderson complete DEXA scan evaluate body composition bone mineral density end chemotherapy . For safety purpose , researcher look lymphedema follow-up evaluation recover surgery , 9 week 6 month surgery . About 8 day follow-up visit send packet seven questionnaire take 45 minute complete , actigraph . You call day suppose wear actigraph , give instruction complete questionnaire .
