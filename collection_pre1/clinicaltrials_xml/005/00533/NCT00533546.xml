	<brief_title>Activated Protein C Acute Stroke Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An ischemic stroke occur damage brain cause blockage blood vessel supply brain . Approximately 500,000 people United States experience type stroke year . The approved treatment acute stroke attempt dissolve blood clot use t-PA ( tissue plasminogen activator ) . This treatment must give within 3 hour symptom onset associate risk brain hemorrhage ( bleed brain ) 6 % ( 6 100 patient ) . Activated Protein C ( APC ) protein blood important dissolve blood clot reduce inflammation . Studies animal suggest APC may also protect brain cell injury cause stroke . We study determine give APC individual stroke safe reduce damage brain cell cause stroke . APC currently approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use patient severe , life-threatening infection .</detailed_description>
