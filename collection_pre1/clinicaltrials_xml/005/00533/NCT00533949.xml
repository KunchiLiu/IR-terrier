	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , carboplatin work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether high-dose radiation therapy effective standard-dose radiation therapy give together combination chemotherapy without cetuximab treat patient non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study high-dose standard-dose radiation therapy give together chemotherapy without cetuximab see well work treat patient newly diagnose stage III non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Standard-Dose Radiation Therapy Chemotherapy With Without Cetuximab Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare overall survival patient newly diagnose , unresectable stage IIIA IIIB non-small cell lung cancer treat high- versus standard-dose conformal radiotherapy concurrent consolidation chemotherapy comprise carboplatin paclitaxel . - To compare overall survival patient treat versus without cetuximab set concurrent chemotherapy Secondary - To compare progression-free survival local-regional tumor control patient treat regimen . - To compare toxicity high- versus standard-dose conformal radiotherapy concurrent chemotherapy versus without cetuximab patient . - To investigate prognostic predictive effect gross tumor volume overall survival patient treat regimen . - To compare quality life patient treat regimen . - To correlate outcome ( i.e. , survival , toxicity , QOL ) patient biological parameter . - To analyze predictive value pre-treatment standardized uptake value ( SUV ) PET scan predicting survival , distant metastasis , local-regional control patient treat regimen . - To explore biological marker predict clinical outcome include survival , distant metastasis , local-regional control , QOL ( include toxicity ) patient treat regimen . - To prospectively collect bank tissue , blood , urine specimens future biomarker analyse predict clinical outcome patient treat regimen . - To investigate association epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) expression toxicity , response , overall survival , progression-free survival . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord PET staging ( yes v ) , radiotherapy technique ( 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy v intensity-modulated radiotherapy ) , Zubrod performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) , 4-dimensional CT planning utilization ( yes v ) , histology ( squamous v non-squamous ) . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . ( Arms II IV close accrual effective 6/17/11 ) - Arm I : Patients undergo standard dose radiotherapy 5 day week 6 week total 60 Gy . Patients receive concurrent chemotherapy comprise paclitaxel IV 1 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 . Patients also receive consolidation treatment paclitaxel carboplatin day 64 85 . Treatment repeat absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients undergo high-dose radiotherapy 5 day per week 7.5 week . Patient also receive concurrent paclitaxel carboplatin Arm I day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 43 . Patients also receive consolidation treatment comprise paclitaxel carboplatin day 71 92 . ( closed accrual effective 6/17/11 ) - Arm III : Patients undergo standard-dose radiotherapy 5 day week 6 week total 60 Gy . Patients receive cetuximab addition concurrent chemotherapy Arm I . Treatment continue chemoradiation cetuximab day 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 43 . Patients receive consolidation treatment cetuximab day 50 , 57 , 64 , 71 , 78 , 85 , 92 , 99 , 106 paclitaxel carboplatin day 71 92 . - Arm IV : Patients undergo high-dose radiotherapy 5 day week 7.5 week total 74 Gy . Patients receive cetuximab addition concurrent chemotherapy Arm I . Treatment continue chemoradiation cetuximab day 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 43 , 50 . Patients receive consolidation treatment cetuximab day 57 , 64 , 71 , 78 , 85 , 92 , 99 , 106 , 113 paclitaxel carboplatin day 78 99 . ( closed accrual effective 6/17/11 ) Patients may undergo tumor tissue , blood , urine collection periodically study tissue banking biomarker correlative study . Patients may undergo quality-of-life assessment baseline periodically study . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 5 year annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
