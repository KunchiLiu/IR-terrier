	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel trabectedin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Colony-stimulating factor , G-CSF pegfilgrastim , may help immune system recover side effect chemotherapy . Giving combination chemotherapy together G-CSF pegfilgrastim may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well give docetaxel trabectedin together G-CSF pegfilgrastim work treat patient recurrent persistent ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cavity cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel , Trabectedin , G-CSF Pegfilgrastim Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To estimate antitumor activity docetaxel plus trabectedin patient persistent recurrent ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cavity cancer primarily frequency objective tumor response . - To determine nature degree toxicity docetaxel plus trabectedin cohort patient . Secondary - To estimate progression-free survival overall survival patient treat docetaxel trabectedin . OUTLINE : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour trabectedin IV 3 hour day 1 . Patients also receive pegfilgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 OR filgrastim ( G-CSF ) IV 15-30 minute SC daily begin day 1 continue blood count recover . Treatment repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
