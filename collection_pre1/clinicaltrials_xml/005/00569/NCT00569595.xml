	<detailed_description>Poor diet , physical inactivity , sedentary behavior among low-income , minority population link great risk chronic health condition overweight/obesity , cardiovascular disease , type 2 diabetes . Low-income clinic serve population often represent untapped opportunity health promotion impoverish individual . Few study examine feasibility use brief physician advice multi-level , clinic-based intervention change poor dietary habit , physical inactivity , sedentary lifestyle behavior among culturally diverse population comprise clinic population . This exploratory project propose address scientific gap introduce pilot Self-Care Stimulating Disease Prevention Program ( SCSDPP ) address poor dietary habit , physical inactivity , sedentary lifestyle behavior among low income , uninsured patient population ( primarily Latinos ) serve community clinic Venice Family Clinic ( VFC ) health center Los Angeles County . The program include development 1 ) simple-to-use patient Health Priority Assessment ( HPA ) tool design assess patient preference behavior change ; 2 ) standard protocol physician provide brief health advice use motivation interviewing ( &lt; 2 minute per visit ) ; 3 ) protocol distribute self-help aid patient use ( e.g. , pedometer , exercise video ) ; 4 ) series monthly follow-up counseling session lay health educator ( e.g. , promotores ) help patient address lifestyle change priority time . We conduct randomize controlled pilot SCSDPP approximately 100 patient case two community health clinic within VFC health center system . The pilot utilize precise outcome measure , include commonly-accepted biomarkers ( e.g. , HgbA1c , fast blood glucose ) psychometrically-validated measure process health status , accurately assess magnitude change diet physical activity among patient 12-month observation period . The feasibility integrate SCSDPP community health clinic setting evaluate , primary aim project . The result inform effort plan large , successor study . Relevance Public Health : study evaluate clinic-based brief intervention help prevent overweight/obesity , public health problem link development metabolic syndrome precursor diabetes .</detailed_description>
