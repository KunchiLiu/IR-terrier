	<brief_summary>This research-based study look biologic feature breast tissue , lymph node tissue , blood order study breast cancer development growth , spread . Through tissue and/or blood sample hope gain knowledge understand improve diagnosis treatment breast cancer identify molecular marker predict clinical outcome response therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Analysis Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The tissue obtain protocol use genome-wide examination DNA , RNA expression profiling , proteomic analysis , isolation analysis normal cancer stem cell , isolation analysis circulate tumor cell , possible analysis immune cell , possible analysis serum factor . The tissue may also use develop patient-specific cell culture model mouse xenograft model breast cancer biologic study tumor progression metastases therapeutic test . In general , tissue use study molecularly classify tumor , identify prognostic marker , identify potential therapeutic marker , identify potential treatment target , help u good understand biology specific role play different tumor cell metastatic process . The ultimate goal use molecular analysis improve diagnosis treatment breast cancer .</detailed_description>
