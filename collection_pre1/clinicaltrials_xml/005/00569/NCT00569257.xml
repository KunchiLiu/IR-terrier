	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether AEZS-108 show anti-tumor activity tolerate patient gynecological tumor ( ovarian / endometrial cancer ) show express receptor luteinizing hormone release hormone ( LHRH )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antitumoral Activity Safety AEZS-108 Women With LHRH Receptor Positive Gynecological Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ovary endometrium hormone dependent organ . Receptors different sex hormone find commonly epithelial ovarian endometrial cancer . LHRH receptor express 80 % human ovarian endometrial cancer . As bind site present tumor high concentration normal tissue , receptor represent specific target AEZS-108 doxorubicin couple LHRH analog . Patients whose tumor specimen show positive LHRH receptor expression investigate tumor response tolerability .</detailed_description>
