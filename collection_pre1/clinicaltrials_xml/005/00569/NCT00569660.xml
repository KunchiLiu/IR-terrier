	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn azacitidine help control MF . The safety azacitidine patient Myelofibrosis ( MF ) also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph II Study Azacitidine Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Azacitidine drug design block certain gene cancer cell whose job stop function tumor-fighting gene . By block `` bad '' gene , tumor-fighting gene may able work well . If find eligible take part study , able begin treatment azacitidine . You receive azacitidine injection skin day 7 day row . This repeat every 4 week ( 4 week equal 1 cycle ) . The first cycle azacitidine give M. D. Anderson , outpatient setting . Later cycle treatment course may give M. D. Anderson cancer doctor community . You may receive 12 cycle treatment respond well treatment . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Once go study , receive follow-up standard care disease . This investigational study . Azacitidine FDA approve treatment myelodysplastic syndrome . Its use study experimental . A total 34 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis MF require therapy , include previously treat relapsed refractory , newly diagnose , intermediate high risk accord Lille scoring system ( adverse prognostic factor : Hemoglobin ( Hb ) &lt; 10 g/dl , White Blood Cell ( WBC ) &lt; 4 &gt; 30 x 10*9/L ; risk group : 0 = low , 1 = intermediate , 2 = high ) . Performance 02 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) . Signed informed consent . Patients must chemotherapy 2 week prior enter study recover toxic effect ( grade 01 ) therapy . Patients allow anagrelide hydroxyurea control high platelet WBC count safety . Serum bilirubin level &lt; /= 1.5 time upper limit normal range laboratory Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) . Higher level acceptable attribute active hemolysis ineffective erythropoiesis . Serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) ( aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ] ) serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) ( alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] ) level &lt; /= 2 x ULN . Serum creatinine level &lt; /= 1.5 x ULN ; unless relate MF , judge treat physician . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test prior azacitidine treatment advise avoid become pregnant . Men must advise father child receive treatment azacitidine . Both woman childbearing potential men must practice effective method contraception ( generally accept standard care measure ) . Age &gt; /= 18 . Nursing pregnant female .
