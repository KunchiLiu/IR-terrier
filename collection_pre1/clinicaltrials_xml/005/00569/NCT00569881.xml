	<brief_summary>The prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis infection follow PRK effective eradicate potential infection . In addition , antibiotic rapid onset action , effectively penetrate target tissue , safe toxic layer heal cornea , especially epithelium . Several study investigate toxicity fourth generation fluoroquinolones corneal epithelium study demonstrate gatifloxacin less deleterious heal cornea moxifloxacin . Most study , however , conduct animal . This retrospective chart review .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Topical Fluoroquinolones Epithelial Wound Healing After PRK</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prior generation fluoroquinolones predominantly either inhibit topoisomerase II ( DNA Gyrase ) topoisomerase IV therefore require one genetic mutation bacteria develop resistance . Fourth-generation fluoroquinolones equally effective topoisomerase II IV , significantly expand spectrum action gram-positive agent atypical mycobacteria Nocardia . This duality action fourth generation fluoroquinolones require bacteria become resistant agent , bacteria must undergo two genetic mutation result significantly decrease chance organism develop resistance.Minimum inhibitory concentration determine vitro suggest fourth-generation fluoroquinolones effective second- third-generation fluoroquinolones gram-positive bacteria include Staphylococcal specie find endophthalmitis bacterial keratitis culture . The increased efficacy fourth-generation fluoroquinolones make antibiotic important agent evaluate prophylaxis post-PRK infection . This retrospective chart review .</detailed_description>
