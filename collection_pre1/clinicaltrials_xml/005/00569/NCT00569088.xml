	<detailed_description>Blood stasis blood heat two pathogen theory system Chinese Medicine , cause many disease independently . But internal intractable disease , viral hepatitis , stroke , epidemic hemorrhagic fever , blood stasis blood heat always accompany . So hypothesis raise blood stasis heat ( YURE ) compound pathogen key pathogenesis internal intractable disease . This study aim verify role compound pathogen play hemorrhagic stroke observe progress key pathogenesis . A randomized control trial would conduct five hospital , 300 hospitalize patient hemorrhagic stroke acute phase would receive different intervention basic modern medicine treatment Chinese herb formula combine former . The Chinese herb formula , design guidance theory system Chinese Medicine , suppose cool blood heat dissolve blood stasis . Clinical efficacy safety would evaluate 21-days intervention .</detailed_description>
