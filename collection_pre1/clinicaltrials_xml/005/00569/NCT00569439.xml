The researcher ' hypothesis addition carbohydrate substrate shorten length labor facilitate vaginal delivery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Effects Dextrose Solutions Course Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Factors affect course labor study extensively . Surprisingly , little data effect different type rate intravenous ( IV ) fluids labor . Exercise physiologists show increased fluid intake carbohydrate replacement improve skeletal muscle performance prolong exercise . In 1992 randomized , control study compare IV fluid rate , Garite et al . show low frequency prolong labor , possibly decrease need oxytocin , high IV fluid rate labor . Inadequate hydration may contribute dysfunctional labor possibly increase rate cesarean section . We propose inadequate carbohydrate replacement labor may also contribute prolongation labor increase need operative delivery . Glucose main energy supply pregnant uterus . Physiological requirement glucose labor approximately 10 gram per hour . Adequate supply glucose need maintain exercise tolerance muscle efficiency , important factor progress labor . Dysfunctional labor dystocia , lead indication primary cesarean delivery , cause uterine force insufficiently strong inappropriately coordinate efface dilate cervix . Dystocia also result inadequate voluntary muscle effort second stage labor . It contribute increase risk chorioamnionitis , lead cause maternal fetal morbidity mortality . Supplying carbohydrate fuel work uterine skeletal muscle may improve progress labor , therefore , diminish risk chorioamnionitis need cesarean delivery .</detailed_description>
