	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose Azacytidine ( 5-azacytidine ) combine cytosine arabinoside ( ara-C ) treatment patient relapse and/or refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) high-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) . The safety effectiveness treatment combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study 5-Azacytidine With Ara-C Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>5-azacytidine design `` turn '' growth cancer cell . This may increase ara-C , design kill leukemia cell help stop cell divide . If find eligible take part study , assign treatment group . You randomly assign ( toss coin ) one 4 treatment group . The first 3 6 patient assign Group 1 . If serious side effect experience , next 3 6 patient assign Group 2 . If serious side effect experience , next 3 6 patient assign Group 3 . If serious side effect experience , next 3 6 patient assign Group 4 . If Group 1 , receive low-dose 5-azacytidine infusion vein 20 30 minute every day 7 day . You also receive low-dose ara-C continuous infusion vein 7 day . If Group 2 , receive high-dose 5-azacytidine infusion vein 20 30 minute every day 7 day . You also receive low-dose ara-C continuous infusion vein 7 day . If Group 3 , receive low-dose 5-azacytidine infusion vein 20 30 minute every day 7 day . You also receive high-dose ara-C continuous infusion vein 3 day ( 65 year age old ) 4 day ( young 65 year age ) . If Group 4 , receive high-dose 5-azacytidine infusion vein 20 30 minute every day 7 day . You also receive high-dose ara-C continuous infusion vein 3 day ( 65 year age old ) 4 day ( young 65 year age ) . Each group 's treatment repeat every 4 8 week ( consider 1 cycle treatment ) , depend blood count well bone marrow recover . You receive least 2 cycle treatment . You continue receive treatment , unless disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , may take study . This investigational study . 5-azacytidine approved FDA treatment MDS . Ara-C approve FDA treatment AML . Up 80 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically confirm Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) high risk previously treat Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) . 2 . Patients ( 1 ) refractory disease ( 2 ) first relapse within 6 month therapy ( 3 ) 2nd relapse Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) high risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome MDS consider study . 3 . Patients must chemotherapy 4 week prior enter study recover toxic effect therapy , unless evidence rapidly progressive disease . 4 . Age &gt; =18 year . Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methylation play significant role development , effect azacitidine child well describe . 5 . Patients must normal organ define : Total bilirubin &lt; 2 mg , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) /alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal , Creatinine &lt; 2 mg 6 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 7 . Women child bear potential must negative serum pregnancy test prior azacitidine treatment . 8 . Women child bear potential advise avoid become pregnant men advise father child receive treatment azacytidine . 9 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 . 1 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier , unless evidence rapidly progressive disease . Patients may receive hydroxyurea prior enter study . 2 . Patients may receive investigational agent leukemias . 3 . Patients active brain meningeal disease exclude . 4 . Known suspected hypersensitivity azacitidine mannitol 5 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 6 . Pregnant woman exclude study azacitidine Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methyltransferase inhibitor teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother azacitidine , breastfeed discontinue mother treated azacitidine .</criteria>
