	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study give octreotide acetate together recombinant interferon alfa-2b see well work compare give octreotide acetate together bevacizumab treat patient metastatic locally advanced , high-risk neuroendocrine tumor . Octreotide acetate recombinant interferon alfa-2b may interfere growth tumor cell slow growth cancer . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether give octreotide acetate together recombinant interferon alfa-2b effective give octreotide acetate together bevacizumab treat patient neuroendocrine tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Octreotide Acetate Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2b Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Locally Advanced , High-Risk Neuroendocrine Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare central review-based progression-free survival poor prognosis carcinoid patient treat either depot octreotide ( octreotide acetate ) plus bevacizumab , depot octreotide plus interferon ( recombinant interferon alfa-2b ) . II . To compare overall survival , time treatment failure traditionally report progression-free survival poor prognosis carcinoid patient treat either depot octreotide plus bevacizumab , depot octreotide plus interferon . III . To compare objective response ( confirm unconfirmed CR PR ) poor prognosis carcinoid patient treat either depot octreotide plus bevacizumab , depot octreotide plus interferon . IV . To compare toxicity profile patient treat two regimen . V. To assess prognostic predictive value VEGF expression relation progression-free survival treatment effect . VI . To compare response 5HIAA , chromogranin A neuronspecific enolase among patient elevate level baseline patient treat octreotide plus interferon versus octreotide plus bevacizumab . VII . To assess compare prognostic predictive value combination In-111 pentetreotide somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy ( SRS ) CT vs. CT relation progression-free survival ( PFS ) . VIII . To assess compare prognostic predictive value combination SRS CT vs. CT relation overall survival ( OS ) time treatment failure ( TTF ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord site disease ( small bowel v cecum v appendix v site ) , disease progression initial diagnosis ( yes ) , histologic grade ( low v intermediate [ atypical ] ) , prior octreotide acetate therapy within past 2 month ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive depot octreotide acetate intramuscularly ( IM ) bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive octreotide acetate IM arm I day 1 recombinant interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 19 . Treatment arm repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2-6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
