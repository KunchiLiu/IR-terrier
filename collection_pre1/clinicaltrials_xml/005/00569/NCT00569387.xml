	<brief_title>Vaccine Study Surgically Resected Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unfortunately , despite best clinical effort breakthrough biotechnology , patient diagnose pancreatic cancer continue die disease short period time . The primary reason short progression time disease ; fact , patient pancreatic cancer symptom time diagnosis . Moreover , lack single agent procedure significant impact long term survival rate contribute poor prognostic outcome observe disease . These reason major cause cancer progression usually discuss consider treatment option patient disease continue grow spread . However , another important part body consider -- immune system . Scientists clearly show pancreatic cancer cell well cancer cell produce number abnormal protein abnormal amount certain protein find normal cell . Normally one would expect patient develop immune response abnormal protein find cancer attack much way would fight infection foreign bacteria virus . However , reason scientist fully understand , immune system fail respond abnormal proteins attack cancer cell . This human clinical trial propose new way make immune system recognize cancer encourage attack cancer cell . Many people familiar idea transplant people organ like kidney heart . When organ transplant two people complete one problem occur rejection donate organ recipient . This occur immune system patient receive organ attack donate organ . If attempt transplant pig heart human rejection would dramatically strong organ transplant two people . This partly low animal express sugar-protein pattern surface cell human . In fact , immune system quickly recognize tissue low mammal pig mouse destroys . In project , propose put mouse gene human pancreatic cancer cell produce abnormal sugar pattern stimulate immune system attack pancreatic cancer . This strategy work well kill human cancer cell laboratory , need tried pancreatic cancer patient see effective . We propose test new treatment patient pancreatic cancer undergone tumor resection see stop slow recurrence tumor patient . Patients injected anti-tumor vaccine consist mixture two type dead human pancreatic cancer cell genetically alter express mouse gene responsible make abnormal sugar-protein cell .</detailed_description>

First vaccination must within 6 week surgery . Patients must ability understand study , inherent risk , side effect potential benefit able give write informed consent participate . All subject child produce potential must agree use contraception avoidance pregnancy measure enrol study receive experimental product , one month last immunization . Age &lt; 18yearsold . Active metastasis . Other malignancy within five year , unless probability recurrence prior malignancy &lt; 5 % . Patient 's curatively treat squamous basal cell carcinoma skin patient history malignant tumor past disease free least five year also eligible study . History organ transplant . Current , active immunosuppressive therapy cyclosporine , tacrolimus , etc . Subjects take chronic systemic corticosteroid therapy reason eligible . Subjects may receive steroid prophylactic antiemetic , exceed 10 mg Decadron weekly . Subjects may also receive pulse dos Gemcitabine hypersensitivity , exceed Decadron 8 mg BID x 3 day prior start day Gemcitabine . Subjects receive inhaled topical corticosteroid eligible . Subjects require chronic systemic corticosteroid begin vaccination , remove study . Significant uncontrolled congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , myocardial infarction significant ventricular arrhythmia within last six month . Active infection antibiotic within 1week prior study , include unexplained fever ( temp &gt; 38.1C ) . Autoimmune disease ( e.g. , systemic lupus erythematosis ( SLE ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , etc. ) . Patients remote history asthma mild active asthma eligible . Other serious medical condition may expect limit life expectancy le 2 year ( e.g. , liver cirrhosis ) serious illness medical opinion clinical investigator . Any condition , psychiatric otherwise , would preclude informed consent , consistent followup compliance aspect study ( e.g. , untreated schizophrenia significant cognitive impairment , etc. ) . A known allergy component vaccine cell line . Pregnant nursing woman due unknown effect vaccination develop fetus newborn infant . ( For patient child bear potential , βHCG must complete within 7 day first vaccination ) .</criteria>
