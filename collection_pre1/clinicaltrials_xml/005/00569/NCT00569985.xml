	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study biological therapy treat patient acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) -related lymphoma undergoing stem cell transplant . Giving chemotherapy stem cell transplant stop growth cancer cell stop divide kill . After treatment , stem cell collect patient 's blood store . The stem cell return patient replace blood-forming cell destroy chemotherapy . Giving biological therapy part stem cell transplant may effective treat patient AIDS-related lymphoma</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety feasibility use lentivirus-transduced hematopoietic progenitor cell ( HPCs ) ( lentivirus vector rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ-transduced hematopoietic progenitor cell ) set autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) treatment AIDS relate lymphoma . The safety genetically modify product use transplant procedure assess monitoring subject adverse event ( procedure relate toxicity ) ; absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) /platelet engraftment ( sustained recovery ) ; evidence replication competent vector vector recombination human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) quasi-species present patient . II . To determine quantity duration vector-marked peripheral blood cell characterize : duration level gene mark expression anti-HIV ribonucleic acid ( RNAs ) transduce cell , characterization integration sit vector sequence circulate cell clinical syndrome suggestive clonal expansion hematopoietic cell . In addition , feasibility process assess base result release test transduced cell prior injection patient . III . To determine whether design vector prevents vector mobilization rescue wild-type HIV-1 . IV . To measure effect HIV infection presence HIV-resistant blood cell measure genetic marking vector sequence antiviral treatment interruption . OUTLINE : CONDITIONING : Patients receive carmustine intravenously ( IV ) 1-2 hour day -7 -5 , etoposide IV 4 hour day -4 , cyclophosphamide IV day -2 . TRANSPLANTATION : Patients undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation comprise lentivirus vector rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ-transduced hematopoietic progenitor cell non-bound cluster differentiation ( CD ) 34+ cell IV day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 week 3 month ; 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 18 , 24 month ; every 6 month 3 year ; annually 10 year .</detailed_description>
