	<brief_title>Identifying Shared Genetic Susceptibility Regions Chronic Beryllium Disease Sarcoidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CBD sarcoidosis granulomatous lung disease cause abnormal immune response . While CBD know develop exposure industrial product beryllium , cause sarcoidosis remain undetermined . CBD occur 2 16 % people expose beryllium varies severity symptom . People sarcoidosis often show minor symptom . However , certain variable associate severe form disease . These variable include black race , onset age 40 , involvement three affected organ , presence serious lung disease . When serious symptom sarcoidosis occur , clinical pathological appearance CBD sarcoidosis often hard distinguish . Symptoms common disease include fever , chest pain , weight loss , night sweat , fatigue , presence granuloma lung . The fact severity diseases varies greatly among affected point possible genetic involvement . The genetic basis analyze study begin similar immune response development disease , specifically involve human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) gene product . The purpose study identify common genetic region associate increase risk develop granulomatous disease CBD sarcoidosis . This study utilize novel technique , know genome-wide scan . The study examine previously collect DNA sample participant previous NIH study , A Case Control Etiologic Study Sarcoidosis ( ACCESS ) , participant CBD recruit National Jewish Medical Research Center . Using genome scan , researcher compare genetic region people CBD versus people without CBD expose beryllium . The approach use define genetic region associate sarcoidosis . Genome control method use account population stratification CBD sarcoidosis population . Researchers compare data diseased healthy control group CBD sarcoidosis group identify share genetic region relevant disease development . A second genome scan involve two large population CBD sarcoidosis case control conduct confirm association region disease .</detailed_description>
