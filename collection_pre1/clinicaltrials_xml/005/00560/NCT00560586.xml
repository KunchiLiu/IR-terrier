	<brief_title>Nasal Budesonide Children With Rhinitis and/or Mild Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Untreated OSAS result serious morbidity , primarily affect neurobehavioral cardiovascular system . The severity OSAS partially related adenoid tonsillar size . While adenotonsillectomy ( T &amp; A ) common treatment child OSAS , approach reserve child whose apnea/hypopnea index overnight sleep study exceed critical value . However , consensus appropriate management child AHI &gt; 1 &lt; 7 events/hour sleep . These child constitute 4-6 % child alternative long-term intervention , therefore medical approach obviate surgery , yet lead substantial amelioration sleep-disordered breathing critically need . Anti-inflammatory agent like intra-nasal corticosteroid consider effective treatment child allergic rhinitis . However , one study conduct far , examined effect intranasal corticosteroid , pediatric patient florid OSAS . Thus , study available topical steroid patient OSAS severity would justify T &amp; A . Our leading hypothesis : - Intranasal budesonide therapy may lead improve symptom polysomnographic finding child OSAS without allergic rhinitis would treat T &amp; A . Subjects And Methods Study population Specific Aim . Up 100 child recruit pediatric patient refer evaluation snore underwent clinical evaluation , lateral neck x-ray , overnight sleep study Kosair Children 's Hospital Sleep Medicine Apnea Center . Study Design Specific Aim : After inform consent obtain parent , child fulfil entry criterion randomize use table random number provide Astra-Zeneca . Patients allocate parallel treatment group simple randomization block 4 double blind fashion , accord randomization procedure delineate Astra-Zeneca All patient complete questionnaire regard symptom snore allergic rhinitis symptom prior start study . One group start a-6 week course either nasal topical budesonide ( 32 mcg/puff/nostril nostril ( total 64 mcg ) , day placebo . Parents instructed give drug bedtime . Parents contact weekly investigator determine whether study drug give prescribed . When unable contact parent phone , send follow letter accompany weekly questionnaire postage-paid return envelope . After 6 week , patient overnight sleep study , lateral neck x-ray , fill questionnaire regard snore rhinitis symptoms.. At end 6 week , patient start 6-week course compound receive 1st phase study . All outcome endpoint assess upon completion 2nd 6-week course . The overall rationale schedule follow : We aim ass whether intranasal budesonide effective ameliorate sleep-disordered breathing child . Therefore , aim maximize number child receive intranasal budesonide . This achieve experimental scheme since child receive 6 week therapy , either onset 12-week participation 6 week ( randomize placebo treatment initial 6 week ) . The rationale 6-week duration period anticipate reduction adenoid volume slow process require 3-6 week reach peak effect . We also wish determine whether cessation intranasal budesonide associate exacerbation SDB . To effect , group child initially treat budesonide 6 week provide data towards answer important question . We anticipate rebound increase severity occur may take several week manifest since incremental growth adenoid tissue also take time . Both nasal-budesonide placebo inhaler provide identical container drug manufacturer . The appearance smell budesonide placebo indistinguishable . The investigator aware compound use . The codes patient keep Astra-Zeneca . If adverse event develops , patient withdraw study follow clinically assess overall clinical course . Experimental Protocols Symptoms questionnaire All patient fill snore symptom questionnaire . Lateral Neck X-Rays This perform use standard technique Radiology Department KCH . Overnight Polysomnography All child participate study polysomnographically study inclusion part routine clinical evaluation . In addition , undergo 2 additional sleep study , end 6-week intervention period study . Statistics A sample size 50 patient per arm parallel design study estimate base alpha error 0.05 , beta error 0.2 , baseline mean apnea hypopnea index ( AHI ) 3 , SD 1.5 , potential decrease AHI 20 % . In addition , number subject would allow detection 30 % improvement rhinitis score . Even attrition occur , 40 subject per arm sufficient assume 30 % improvement AHI accord sleep study . This design number also permit accurate determination rebound exacerbation follow transition budesonide placebo half subject . ( see ) . Results express mean +/- SEM . To assess treatment effectiveness , pair t-tests use compare normally distribute variable . Potential Risks Nasal budesonide ( Rhinocort Aqua , AstraZeneca ) generally well tolerated.. The commonly reported adverse event ( 2 % ) Rhinocort Aqua vehicle placebo ( formulation active drug ) respectively : epistaxis ( nosebleed ) - 8 percent v 5 percent ; pharyngitis ( sore throat ) - 4 percent v 3 percent ; bronchospasm 2 percent v 1 percent ; nasal irritation - 2 percent v &lt; 1 percent ; cough - 2 percent v &lt; 1 percent . Rare adverse event report include : nasal septum perforation , pharynx disorder ( throat irritation pain , swollen throat , burn throat , itch throat , angioedema , anosmia palpitation . Even though , study show detectable adrenal suppression intranasal steroid administration,30 intranasal budesonide 200 Âµg daily find effect 24 hour , fractionate cortisol profile serum urine.31 And although transient growth suppression report medium high dose inhale steroid , similar side effect report clinical study intranasal budesonide . Furthermore , addition intranasal budesonide therapy medium dose inhale budesonide child asthma approximately 24 month significant effect final adult height.32 Potential Benefits It possible participant improvement severity OSAS snore severity nasal budesonide therapy . The information obtain study , help define role nasal budesonide intervene pathophysiology OSAS , potential role nasal budesonide nonsurgical therapy child otherwise mild OSAS would consider candidate T &amp; A . Significance Research For child OSAS mild justify T &amp; A surgery , Intranasal therapy budesonide may become safe effective new therapy aim minimize morbidity associate OSAS child .</detailed_description>
