	<brief_title>Efficacy Study ABR-215050 Treat Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For asymptomatic patient Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer ( CRPC ) , `` window opportunity '' present . During `` window opportunity '' intervention little toxicity potential extend `` symptom-free '' period would great value keep metastatic patient asymptomatic stage thus delay introduction chemotherapy . The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy ABR-215050 interventional agent role . Overall survival patient participate study 07TASQ08 evaluate retrospectively use separate study protocol 11TASQ11 .</detailed_description>
