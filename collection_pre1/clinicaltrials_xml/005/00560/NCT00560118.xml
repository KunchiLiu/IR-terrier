	<brief_title>Fotemustine Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess relationship MGMT expression response fotemustine patient metastatic malignant melanoma . Secondary - Establish value MGMT expression fotemustine strong probability effectiveness . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprise fotemustine IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Beginning 5 week later , patient achieve stable objective response receive maintenance chemotherapy comprise fotemustine IV 1 hour every 3 week 6 course . Tissue sample collect baseline ass level MGMT expression PCR . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
