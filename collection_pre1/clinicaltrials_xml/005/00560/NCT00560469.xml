	<brief_summary>Obesity strong risk factor develop type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) , reason fully understood . In particular , know obese people develop T2DM obese individual . This study test whether difference fat cell ( adipocytes ) blame . Even adult , fat cell constantly form replace old fat cell respond body 's need store excess energy . The ability form new fat cell may diminish individual , lead large fat cell . These large fat cell secrete hormone may increase risk T2DM . This study test whether fat cell obese insulin resistant subject ( risk develop T2DM ) form slow rate insulin sensitive subject ( low risk develop T2DM ) . To address question recruit study two group obese subject , select similar age , gender degree obesity . One group subject obese insulin resistant ( OIR group ) , comparably obese , insulin sensitive ( OIS ) . Subjects undergo series study characterize metabolism include measurement body fat DEXA scanning , oral glucose tolerance ( test use diagnose diabetes ) measurement insulin sensitivity response infusion insulin ( research study use classify patient OIR OIS group ) . Small sample fat ( skin belly buttock ) obtain use needle two occasion 12 week . During 12 week , subject drink small amount water contain non-radioactive label . This labeled water allow u measure rate growth new fat cell body . We also look rate growth fat cell obtain biopsy laboratory . The result study may tell u certain obese people develop diabetes others . This might lead new way prevent treat T2DM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overview design : To address specific aim study recruit study two group obese subject , select similar age , gender BMI . Based result oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) hyperinsulinemic-glucose clamp , one group obese insulin resistant ( OIR ) one obese insulin sensitive ( OIS ) . Subjects undergo measurement body fat fat distribution , oral glucose tolerance , vivo insulin sensitivity , percutaneous needle biopsy subcutaneous abdominal gluteal fat vivo measurement SVC adipocyte turnover use D2O DNA labeling technique . Adipocyte size expression pro-inflammatory cytokine adipokines compare two group . Primary culture preadipocytes derived subject proliferation differentiation measure vitro compare vivo measure . Measurement adipocyte proliferation differentiation vivo : The stable isotope technique Hellerstein et al . measurement slowly divide cell base incorporation deuterium oxide ( D2O ) DNA . This method use estimate rate turnover adipocytes stromal vascular cell healthy normal volunteer . It , date , employ compare group subject may differ adipogenic propensity . A major objective study , therefore , evaluate utility approach quantify vivo difference adipocyte SVC turnover group vary insulin sensitivity compare vivo measure obtain use technique vitro measure adipogenesis .</detailed_description>
