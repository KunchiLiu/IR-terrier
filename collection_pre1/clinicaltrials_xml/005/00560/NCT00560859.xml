	<brief_summary>The purpose research determine effect adenotonsillectomy surgery ( removal tonsil adenoid ) obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) child . OSAS cause health problem include poor growth , high blood pressure , diabetes behavioral learn difficulty . Although adenotonsillectomy usual treatment child OSAS , know certainty child 's OSAS symptom improve afterwards . This study help determine improvement occurs . It also look whether certain group , child overweight different ethnicity , help surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Study Children With OSAS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because adenotonsillectomy usual treatment OSAS , child study get surgery . However , order ass extent adenotonsillectomy surgery improve breathe disturbance sleep quality child OSAS , two group study . One group get surgery early ( one month enrollment ) group re-evaluated surgery within 7 month enrollment . Children group closely monitor 7-8 month study period sleep health educational material provide assist establish healthy habit .</detailed_description>
