	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) common inherit disease world affect African Caribbean population . SCD cause homozygous inheritance gene sickle hemoglobin ( HbS ) . Most patient SCD develop abnormal pulmonary function characterize airway obstruction , restrictive lung disease , abnormal diffusing capacity , hypoxemia pulmonary hypertension In healthy subject , lung capillary blood volume ( Qc ) membrane diffuse capacity ( Dm ) accurately measure nitric oxide-carbon monoxide ( NO-CO ) method . We propose study , first time , lung capillary blood volume alveolar membrane diffuse capacity , use NO-CO method , child SCD age least 6 year Early determination lung function pulmonary circulation child SCD important , understanding physiopathologic mechanism disease also well therapeutic management child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Lung Capillary Blood Volume Children With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose study , first time , lung capillary blood volume alveolar membrane diffuse capacity , use NO-CO method , child SCD age least 6 year . We compare lung function measurement Qc Dm 2 group 120 subject , one group SCD child , normal child match age ethnic origin . Measurement lung capillary blood measure twice , assess short term reproducibility . The measurement do sit position lie one part subject , rest moderate rectangular exercise part subject . These different test design assess physiological adaptation pulmonary circulation two population child . Combined complete lung function measurement , echocardiographic assessment pulmonary hemodynamics , measurement exhale nitric oxide , evaluation lead good understanding pathophysiology lung injury SCD . The study complete Robert Debr√© Hospital , close collaboration Sickle Cell Disease Center Physiology Department . Children include informed consent sign , legally prescribe .</detailed_description>
