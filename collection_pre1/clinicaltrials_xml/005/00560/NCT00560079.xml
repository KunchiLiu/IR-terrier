	<detailed_description>Men woman age 18 65 year , inpatient diagnosis manic episode recruit emergency room Espirita Hospital Porto Alegre ( HEPA ) , Brazil ( n=180 ) September 2004 2006 . The presence manic episode confirm use SCID-I severity episode evaluate use Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) Clinical Global Impression scale ( CGI ) . Patients required present score &gt; 22 YMRS screening include . Subjects present rapid cycling , mixed episode comorbidities axis I psychiatric disorder consider inclusion . All subject present good physical health determine physical exam , medical history , blood screen electrocardiogram . Patients randomly assign allopurinol 600 mg/day , dipyridamole 200mg placebo add-on medication lithium treatment 4-week , double-blind trial . The use adjunctive antipsychotic agent ( typical second-generation drug ) allow double-blind period . Adjunctive diazepam use necessary ( maximum dose=20mg/day ) . Raters ( psychiatrist ) train together establish reliability ( YMRS =0.90 ) . This study approve Espirita Hospital Ethics Committee-IRB . Written inform consent obtain patient and/or family member . Possible adverse event monitor weekly follow-up period . Regarding primary outcome measure , compare percentage responder accord YMRS score decrease least 50 % among allopurinol , dipyridamole placebo group , use fisher exact test . Also , percentage improvement baseline endpoint obtain compare among group use analysis variance ( one-way ANOVA ) Duncan post-hoc test . Remission rate ( YMRS score &lt; 12 ) also analyze . P value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Besides completers analysis , intention treat LOCF employ include data drop-out patient evaluate visit 3 . Possible correlation measure use Pearson test . Fischer exact test X2 evaluate response remission rate . Data present mean Â± standard deviation .</detailed_description>
