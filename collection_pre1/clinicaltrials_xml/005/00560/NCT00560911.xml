However , study yet assess safety efficacy OAC self-management elderly patient major thromboembolic haemorrhagic complication primary outcome . In multi-centre , open , randomise control trial , patient age 60 year randomise self-management routine care group follow least two year . The primary hypothesis study self-management oral anticoagulation superior compare routine control term reduce thromboembolic event require hospitalisation major bleed complication primary endpoint .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oral anticoagulation ( OAC ) show highly effective prevent thromboembolic complication patient indicate . Numerous study document elderly patient seem benefit OAC therapy . Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , incidence increase age approach 10 % individual age ≥ 80 year , carry main risk stroke , among elderly patient without antithrombotic therapy , Despite proven benefit , numerous study report reluctance prescribing OAC due variety barrier , especially elderly . Risk haemorrhage , fact twice great 70 year age young patient , one major determinant refusal prescribe OAC therapy . The risk stroke rise steeply patient atrial fibrillation INR value less 1.8 INR value great 4 5 rapidly associate increase bleed rate . Due relatively small therapeutic range , reality often small percentage INR value find within target range , low 29 % INR measurement , see routine care patient prior participation randomise self-management programme study . One way improve OAC care introduce patient ' self-management OAC therapy . In context important differentiate INR self-testing alone , full self-management . Self-management include self-adaptation anticoagulation treatment base self-monitoring result patient participate structured instruction treatment programme . Our study aim provide answer important medical question examine elderly patient receive long-term anticoagulation treatment randomise self-management versus routine-care group , thromboembolic haemorrhagic complication primary outcome .</detailed_description>
