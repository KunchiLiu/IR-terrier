	<brief_title>Follow-Up Study Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery Stage I , Stage II , Stage III Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess effect augment symptomatic follow-up primary care two intensive method follow-up ( monitor tumor marker primary care intensive image hospital ) survival patient stage I , II , III colorectal cancer undergone curative resection . Secondary - Determine quality life patient . - Determine cost National Health Service ( NHS ) service utilize . - Determine NHS cost per life-year save . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord certainty need image follow-up , determine local clinician ( uncertain v certain ) . Patients randomize 1 4 follow-up arm . - Arm I ( primary care follow-up ) : Patients undergo symptomatic follow-up ( i.e. , ask contact physician symptom suggestive disease recurrence ) . Some patient may also undergo single CT scan 12-18 month post-randomization . - Arm II ( primary care follow-up ) : Patients undergo tumor marker measurement ( CEA ) baseline , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year . Some patient may also undergo single CT scan 12-18 month post-randomization . - Arm III ( intensive hospital follow-up ) : Patients undergo CT scan MRI baseline , every 6 month 2 year , annually 3 year . - Arm IV ( primary care intensive hospital follow-up ) : Patients undergo primary care intensive hospital follow-up arm II ( without single CT scan ) III . All patient receive handbook physician detail possible symptom suggestive disease recurrence . Quality life assess baseline annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
