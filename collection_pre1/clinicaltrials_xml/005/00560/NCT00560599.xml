	<brief_title>A Randomized Clinical Trial Prevent Recurrent CA-MRSA Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Staphylococcus aureus ubiquitous pathogen , cause infection skin , lung , bloodstream , body part . Over past decade , community-acquired methicillin resistant S. aureus ( CA-MRSA ) infection , previously extremely rare , occur commonly worldwide . CA-MRSA common cause skin infection many locale U.S. , include Southern California . CA-MRSA strain notable ability spread close setting cause recurrent infection among healthy person . Management recurrent CA-MRSA infection challenge optimal prevention strategy undefined . Many expert recommend topical agent decontaminate body and/or anterior naris . Others suggest environmental decontamination help control recurrences transmission within household . However , data quantify efficacy safety approach . We conduct multi-center clinical trial compare efficacy safety body environmental decolonization regimens prevention CA-MRSA infection . This trial conduct Kaiser Permanente Southern California ( KPSC ) sit among KPSC enrollee . The study population comprise person suffer recurrent CA-MRSA infection . Household member `` index subject '' also offer chance enroll study . For clinical trial , subject randomize 2 x 2 design test : 1 ) chlorhexidine body wash nasal mupirocin ointment vs. usual care , 2 ) environmental cleanse ethanol spray aggressive laundering vs. environmental cleansing . Household member , consent , also enrol study treatment arm `` index subject '' . We also perform select secondary analysis , include study efficacy intervention prevent infection household member . Additionally , examine strain relatedness colonize infect CA-MRSA strain well understand colonization dynamic within household .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Is member Kaiser Permanente Southern California ( KPSC ) Have least 1 culture positive MRSA prior 12 month least one skin infection prior 12 month . The culture ( ) and/or skin infection ( ) : A . Be associate mutually exclusive patient encounter separate least 21 day . The encounter include : outpatient visit primary care provider ; outpatient visit emergency department urgent care facility ; inpatient hospitalization ( admission date consider encounter date ) AND Each patient encounter define section A associate EITHER : B . EITHER receipt prescription ( course ) antibiotic clinical infection . OR C. A visit outpatient setting ( include primary care provider visit , emergency department visit , phone consultation , urgent care visit ) skin skin structure infection . Age 1 month old Ability willingness take intranasal medication , topical body wash , environmental decontamination measure . Ability willingness subject legal guardian/representative give write informed consent . Ability willingness participate study accord treatment allocation even randomize active intervention . Current residence KPSCassociated chronic care facility chroniccare facility ( e.g. , rehabilitation facility nursing home ) Receipt hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis prior 12 month Any follow severe underlying condition : Organ transplantation , active recent malignancy , cancer , inflammatory disorder require ( would require treatment ) prior 12 month , radiation therapy , surgery , chemotherapy , systemic immunomodulatory therapy ( e.g. , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha inhibitor rheumatic inflammatory disease ) , corticosteroid therapy ( define &gt; 7.5 mg prednisone ( equivalent dose nonprednisone corticosteroid ) daily adult , physiologic level prednisone corticosteroid therapy daily child ) . Any follow major surgical procedure prior 12 month : orthopedic procedure , cardiothoracic surgery , abdominal surgery . Use follow drug procedure within 120 day prior study entry : topical mupirocin ( Bactroban Bactroban Nasal ) , Chlorhexidine ( e.g. , Hibiclens brand generic formulation ) body wash , environmental decontamination household ethyl alcohol ( e.g. , Lysol Brand Disinfectant Spray Kitchens brand generic formulation ) , bleach dilute bleach solution , similar regimen Current use systemic antibiotic use specifically treat skin skin structure infection , MRSA infection , S. aureus infection . Patients systemic therapy note must complete systemic antibiotic therapy prior enrollment . Active drug alcohol use dependence , opinion investigator , would interfere adherence study requirement . Current skin wound lesion deeper superficial layer skin ( know relative contraindication topical Hibiclens ) . Subjects deep skin infection may enrol wound heal sufficiently wound deep superficial skin layer Known hypersensitivity allergic reaction either topical mupirocin mupirocincontaining product ( e.g. , Bactroban Bactroban Nasal ) , chlorhexidine chlorhexidinecontaining ( e.g. , Hibiclens ) topical wash product contain chlorhexidine . Concurrent use intranasal product ( e.g. , saline wash , topical decongestant , antihistamine , anticholinergic ) . Patients use product willing discontinue therapy seven day mupirocin administer ( randomized medication ) allow participate consultation patient 's provider . Chronic skin condition associate hypersensitivity use topical cleanser preparation . Known hypersensitivity among household member agent list , specifically mupirocin , chlorhexidine , topical ethanol . `` Heavy '' excessive use body decolonize agent triclosancontaining soap Phisohex , determine Study Site Coordinator .</criteria>
