	<brief_summary>Children survive type cancer high risk develop learn problem cancer treatment child cancer treatment . Cancer treatment may cause problem learn , attention , memory . The purpose study identify brain change may underlie learn problem cancer survivor investigate whether methylphenidate ( stimulant medication ) may reduce problem . Subjects treatment acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) brain tumor ask take part research study . Siblings subject also ask take part , result compare child cancer treatment . We hypothesize child receive aggressive therapy lower white matter brain volume volumes significantly low age-matched sibling . We also hypothesize child take methylphenidate show improvements teacher parent report measure attention social skill .</brief_summary>
