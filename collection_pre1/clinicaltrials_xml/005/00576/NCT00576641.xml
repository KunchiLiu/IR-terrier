	<brief_summary>The purpose Dendritic Cell Immunotherapy study patient glioblastoma and/or brainstem glioma determine whether patient malignant brain tumor , dendritic cell inject peripherally reactivate immune system brain tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunotherapy Patients With Brain Stem Glioma Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients white blood cell remove grown culture condition make dendritic cell . Dendritic cell small group cell belong white blood cell population . These cell responsible let immune system know something foreign , like bacteria tumor , body . Dendritic cell help body ward disease alert immune system . In previous clinical trial , brain tumor cell call astrocytoma tumor cell glioblastoma tumor cell take tumor remove surgery . The brain tumor cell place solution laboratory make grow . Certain part brain tumor 's protein ( peptide ) remove grow tumor cell mixed together dendritic cell blood take vein . This combination dendritic cell brain tumor peptide inject patient 's skin , like vaccination . This process similar use vaccination . The patient give three four injection dendritic cell mixed tumor peptide course twenty-eight day period . In study , protein manufacture know associated brain cancer mixed dendritic cell obtain leukopheresis ( procedure dendritic cell separate patient ' blood ) . They undergo three vaccination along follow clinic visit ( include evaluation laboratory test ) check status . The investigator learn possible generate immune response subset patient malignant glioma . In addition , cell able reach brain kill brain tumor cell . The survival patient study prolong compare historical control . Based clinical data subject brain tumor , investigator believe peripheral injection dendritic cell generate potent immune response patient brain stem gliomas and/or glioblastoma . The investigator hope determine whether therapy translate longer survival well quality life patient survival measured month . Through study investigator hope learn role body 's immune response cancer use dendritic cell immunotherapy . This information may prove useful therapy patient glioblastoma and/or brainstem glioma .</detailed_description>
