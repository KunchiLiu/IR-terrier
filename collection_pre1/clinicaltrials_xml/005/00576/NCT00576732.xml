	<brief_title>A Study Effectiveness Safety Two Doses Risperidone Treatment Children Adolescents With Autistic Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autistic Disorder condition develop early childhood persists throughout life . Seventy-five percent child adolescents autistic disorder irritability symptom aggression towards others , deliberate self-injurious behavior , temper tantrum , quickly change mood . These symptom affect daily functioning school performance , interaction family member compliance treatment . Risperidone atypical antipsychotic agent recently approve treatment irritability associate Autistic Disorder child adolescent age 5 16 year . The approved dose range 0.5-3 mg per day . The aim study evaluate effectiveness ( change level irritability relate behavior ) low dose ( 0.125 mg 0.175 mg risperidone per day depend body weight ) . The study include three treatment group . A placebo group , low dose risperidone group high dose risperidone group ( 1.25 mg 1.75mg per day depend body weight ) . This phase study 6 week . During study , neither investigator patient tell treatment patient receive . This call `` double blind '' . The placebo treatment expect effective . The high dose group expect effective . At end study , data low dose group compare placebo group see effective . Another aim study evaluate safety tolerability risperidone . At end 6-week double-blind period , patient may enter 6-month open-label period patient receive risperidone . During phase study , dos adjust maximum 1.25 mg 1.75mg per day depend body weight . Both investigator patient know dose patient taking . About 93 patient randomize . The study conduct investigator 15 clinic . Assessments effectiveness include Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) subscales include irritability subscale ( ABC-I ) , Clinical Global Impression Change ( CGI C ) ; Clinical Global Impression Severity ( CGI-S ) ; response rate , Compulsions Subscale Children 's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( CY BOCS ) . Safety evaluation include monitor adverse event , physical examination , clinical laboratory test , nighttime sleep quality daytime drowsiness , extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) assess use Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) , Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale ( BARS ) Simpson-Angus Scale ( SAS ) . Venous blood sample collect determination plasma concentration risperidone 9-hydroxyrisperidone . The study hypotheses high dose level risperidone significantly superior placebo measure change baseline ABC-I Subscale score end point ( Week 6 early withdrawal ) low dose level risperidone significantly superior placebo measure change baseline ABC-I Subscale score end point ( Week 6 early withdrawal ) . Double-blind phase : Risperidone oral solution take daily . Depending body weight patient take 1.25 mL 1.75 mL either 0.1 mg/mL 1.0 mg/mL risperidone solution match placebo , 6 week . Open-label phase : Medication take twice day . Starting 0.125mg 0.175mg per day , drug level titrate 2 week maximum dose level 1.25 mg risperidone/day 1.75 mg /day depend body weight , 26 week .</detailed_description>
