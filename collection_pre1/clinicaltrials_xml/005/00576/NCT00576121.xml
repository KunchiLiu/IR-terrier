	<detailed_description>Patients admit Yale New Haven Hospital first acute myocardial infarction within onset 12 hour symptom eligible study refer physician study . Subjects screen medical interview physical exam eligibility . Clinical data obtain demographic purpose include : EKG upon admission , serum cardiac marker , basic metabolic panel , cardiac catheterization report recent echocardiography report . All standard medication allow include diuretic , ACE/Ang-II inhibitor , nitrates/hydralazine , digoxin , low dose aspirin , beta-blockers , calcium channel antagonist , anticoagulant anti-arrhythmic agent . A 10cc blood sample draw peripheral vein 3 day post myocardial infarction chill EDTA tube , plasma decant placed -70 degree C MMP/TIMP assay perform . These sample send collaborator Medical University South Carolina high sensitivity plasma assay develop MUSC MMP-1 , -13 , -8 , -2 , -9 TIMP-1 , -2 , -4 . [ 1 ] These assay perform Core C detailed description specificity measurement describe . In addition , index collagen synthesis degradation , use telopeptide measurement measure plasma sample . Nitroglycerin rest Tl-201 myocardial perfusion image perform 2-5 day myocardial infarction . Subjects peripheral intravenous line place injected 2.5-3.5mCi Tl-201 . The Tl-201 give slightly low dosage standard clinical protocol Yale New Haven Hospital nuclear cardiology lab improve reconstruction algorithm CT allow low dos radioactive isotope . Resting myocardial perfusion image acquire 5 minute post-injection multislice helical SPECT/CT ( GE Infinia Hawkeye ) follow CT scan . A redistribution image perform 4 hour thallium administration . Each SPECT scan take approximately 25 minute . Perfusion defect size quantify use Yale C-Q method previously describe [ 2 ] . Transthoracic echocardiography perform 2-5 day post-MI 28 day MI standard apical parasternal view use commercial ultrasound system either Phillips 7500 IE33 ultrasound image system S3 transducer . The transducer place apical and/or parasternal location chest ECG-gated image obtain breath hold . Each acquisition perform zoom mode 40 Hz , entire LV 4 cardiac cycle 40 frame per cardiac cycle . Image data capture digital form back DVDs . NOTE : No patient HIPPA data save DVD . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , end-diastolic volume ( LVEDV ) , end-systolic volume ( LVESV ) measure . The echocardiogram use determine LV mass , LV cavity size regional thickening . Patients undergo MRI gadolinium contrast GE Signa 1.5 tesla magnetic resonance image scanner locate Yale-New Haven Hospital MRI Center , use standard ECG-gated cine gradient echo , echo-planar , phase contrast MR tag image sequence . Electrocardiographic monitoring maintain magnetic resonance imaging . MRI scan occur 2-5 day post-MI . The first acquisition perform combined cine-gradient echo/cine phase velocity approach obtain magnitude image require segmentation shape-based track well contrast data find midwall myocardial velocity single image acquisition . This sequence yield adjacent 5 mm thick axial image plane resolution approximately 1.6mm x 1.6mm . We acquire 16-20 cardiac phase per location . Patients receive 0.1 mmol/kg standard gadolinium contrast peripheral IV . The acquisition apply inversion recovery preparatory pulse null normal myocardium , follow segment k-space gradient echo acquisition . We anticipate propose magnetic resonance imaging subject complete within 2 hour . The technologist doctor operate scanner able see subject . The operator maintain contact voice subject . None aforementioned procedure consider experimental individually , may may part subject ' standard care post myocardial infarction . During part step image acquisition , physician present . All data transfer via network image processing laboratory analysis include project personal information .</detailed_description>
