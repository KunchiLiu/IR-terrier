	<criteria>Male female age Subject undergoing peripheral vascular surgery , ie , conduit placement ePTFE graft arterioarterial bypass [ include : axillofemoral , iliofemoral , femorofemoral , iliopopliteal , femoropopliteal ( include knee ) , femorotibial vessel bypass ] , arteriovenous dialysis access shunt upper low extremity . Signed informed consent Intraoperative inclusion criterion : Suture line bleed eligible study treatment present surgical hemostasis ( i.e. , suture ) . Suture line bleed eligible study treatment define : suture line bleed would prevent immediate closure wound require treatment bleeding first , scale mild , moderate , severe , suture line bleed assessed moderate severe . ( Moderate define : either 25 % suture line bleeds , least 5 suture line bleeding present , counting suture line bleeding possible , one pulsatile suture line bleed present . Severe define : either 50 % suture line bleeds , least 10 suture line bleeding present , counting suture line bleeding possible , one pulsatile suture line bleeding present , least one spurt suture line bleed present . ) Note : Bleedings treat additional suture appropriate study . Such anastomosis receive additional suture , recategorized , still comply inclusion criterion , randomize . Subjects concurrently participate another clinical study treatment another investigational drug device within last 30 day Other vascular procedure surgical session ( stenting and/or endarterectomy artery allow ) Arterioarterial bypass 2 anastomosis ( e.g. , aortobifemoral , axillobifemoral etc . ) Pregnant lactate woman Congenital coagulation disorder Prior kidney transplantation Heparininduced thrombocytopenia Known prior exposure aprotinin within last 12 month Known hypersensitivity aprotinin component product Known severe congenital acquire immunodeficiency ( e.g. , HIV infection long term treatment immunosuppressive drug ) Prior radiation therapy operate field Severe local inflammation operate field . Intraoperative exclusion criterion : Major intraoperative complication require resuscitation deviation plan surgical procedure . Intraoperative change plan surgical procedure , result subject long meeting preoperative inclusion and/or exclusion criterion , ( e.g . abandonment ePTFE graft placement ) .</criteria>
