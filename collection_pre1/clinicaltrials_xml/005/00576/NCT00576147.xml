	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . To determine sensitivity specificity Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) measurement identify intracranial hematoma due trauma . 2 . To determine reproducibility Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) measurement different operator different center</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multi-Center Study Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) Hematoma Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principle use identify intracranial hematoma Near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) extravascular blood absorbs Near-infrared light intravascular blood since great ( usually 10-fold great ) concentration hemoglobin acute hematoma brain tissue blood contain within vessel . Therefore , absorbance Near-infrared light great ( therefore reflect light less ) side brain contain hematoma , uninjured side . The NIRS sensor place successively left right frontal , temporal , parietal , occipital area head absorbance light select wavelength record . The difference optical density different area calculate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Undergoing CT scan within 12 hour head injury . The criterion obtain CT scan base standard care , generally patient moderate severe head injury receive CT scan admission hospital , patient undergo CT enrol study . The noncontrast CT perform accord standard method . 12 hour since injury . Massive scalp laceration , avulsion , hematoma The limitation injury within 12 hour necessary hematoma blood metabolize , absorbance characteristic change .</criteria>
