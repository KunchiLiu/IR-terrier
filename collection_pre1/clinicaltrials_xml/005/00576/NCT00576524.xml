	<brief_title>Application Impedance Threshold Device Technologies Treat Prevent Hypotension During Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effective fluid removal hemodialysis one big challenge child end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Generally , child tolerate 3-4 % body weight removed dialysis session thus necessitate multiple session week ensure effective renal replacement . Excessive fluid removal often associate nausea , vomit , hypotension cramp result serious complication patient care immediately dialysis well reduce patient compliance . The development novel therapy increase amount fluid remove session without correspond increase incidence complication therefore important improve quality compliance hemodialysis ; eventually survival child ESRD . The purpose study evaluate application impedance threshold device hemodialysis child optimize fluid removal , reduce incidence complication ( cramp , vomit hypotension ) , device tolerance .</detailed_description>
