	<brief_summary>The human vagina contain large number normal bacteria . These bacteria important provide protection bacteria may cause disease . Several important disease link abnormal bacteria vagina . Women abnormal bacteria vagina likely infected human immunodeficiency virus , virus cause AIDS . Also woman unusual bacteria vagina likely deliver premature baby pregnant . For reason , important well understanding normal bacteria vagina.Some bacteria find vagina grown laboratory . Our preliminary study indicate wide variety bacteria vagina . Also show difference African American Caucasian woman . The goal study study bacteria vagina normal woman use late technology . This technology involve study bacterial DNA present normal microbe vagina</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The normal vaginal bacteria healthy woman reproductive age play key role prevent successful colonization `` undesirable '' organism include responsible bacterial vaginosis , yeast infection , sexually transmit disease urinary tract infection . Our long-term goal develop accurate understanding vagina microbial ecosystem normal , healthy woman essential prerequisite comprehend normal microflora reduces risk acquire common vaginal infection . Four hundred woman recruit equal distribution among four self-declared ethnic group ( Caucasian , African-American , Hispanic Asian ) . These grouping select base original Forney study identify different distribution supergroups dominant vaginal microflora African-American Caucasian woman . The experimental focus proposal use combination culture-independent method ( T-RFLP 16S rRNA , 16SrRNA recA gene sequence analysis community genomics ) develop tool aim advance understanding composition role individual organisms community make ecosystems human vagina . The specific aim design develop genomic tool research clinical scientific community study ecology human vaginal microflora</detailed_description>
