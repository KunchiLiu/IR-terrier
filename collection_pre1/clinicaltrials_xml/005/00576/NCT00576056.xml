	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine TACE plus Sorafenib improve outcome patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) amenable surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Safety Study TACE Plus Oral Sorafenib Unresectable HCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study make important contribution understand safety efficacy sorafenib addition TACE patient diagnose unresectable HCC , also first clinical trial sorafenib ass effect novel therapy HRQL . Understanding effect sorafenib HRQL critical treatment HCC secondary modest benefit survival report conventional therapy . Our team one large experience evaluate HRQL patient diagnose unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma . We previously report alternative method evaluate HRQL , solution miss data clinical trial well test statistical clinically meaningful difference , within treatment group , clinical trial patient diagnose hepatobiliary carcinoma .</detailed_description>
