	<brief_summary>Malignant glioma aggressive among common brain tumor . A diagnosis carry median survival approximately 12 month , 90 - 95 % patient survive less 2 year . The current standard treatment surgical resection follow radiation therapy chemotherapy substantially prolong survival even treatment option show exhibit small increase survival primarily benefit certain ( i.e. , young ) patient subpopulation . Cancer vaccines represent one novel therapy malignant glioma . The goal body recognize tumor cell foreign produce response fight recur tumor cell . A promising mean cause immune response body create immunity use dendritic cell ( DC ) vaccine . Dendritic cell small group cell contain everyone 's white blood cell population . These cell responsible let immune system know something foreign , like bacteria , tumor , body . Dendritic cell help body ward disease alert immune system . gliadel FDA - approve drug - wafer contain concentrated amount chemotherapy agent . These wafer place brain cavity tumor resect ( remove ) deliver steady amount immediate chemotherapy medicine surround brain tissue . Also , since Gliadel local chemotherapy , prevent detrimental suppression ( weaken ) immune system show systemic ( throughout body ) chemotherapy . In prior Phase l phase study , patient receive chemotherapy follow Dendritic cell demonstrate long progression free overall survival patient receive Dendritic cell chemotherapy alone . The purpose study determine whether standard therapy tumor resection surgery , along placement Gliadel wafer time surgery follow dendritic cell vaccine generate ( start ) immune response , provide long progression free survival . Patients screen enrolled clinical trial due screen failure notify reason screen failure . Pre HIV counsel appropriate referral resource provide . If screen failure due positive HIV test , appropriate post HIV counseling provide appropriate referral make . The chart patient screen failure destroyed.The patient chart enrol study keep locked cabinet research office . patient assign unique identifying code know research team . Data capture various source document , , necessary , abstracted hospital medical record experience registered nurse . The electronic data viral test accessible research personnel .</brief_summary>
