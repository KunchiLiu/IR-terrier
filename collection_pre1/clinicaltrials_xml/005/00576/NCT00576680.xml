	<brief_title>RAD001 Temozolomide Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Participants take RAD001 mouth daily . They also take temozolomide mouth daily one week , follow one-week break period . This one-week on/one week schedule temozolomide continue duration treatment . - After first month treatment , 7-day observation period study medication take observe side effect . - During treatment cycle ( 1 cycle 28 day length ) participants physical exam ask question general health specific question problem may experience . Initially , participant come every week . At visit , blood work take monitor participant health . - After every 2 month treatment , participant CT scan MRI do see medication work .</detailed_description>
