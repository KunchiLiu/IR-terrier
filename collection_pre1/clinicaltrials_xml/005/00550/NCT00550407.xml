Bipolar I Disorder , recent episode depressed（296.5x） Bipolar I Disorder , recent episode hypomanic（296.40） Bipolar I Disorder , recent episode manic（296.4x） The diagnosis mood episode make reference Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview : M.I.N.I , Japanese Version . At Screening The subject diagnose bipolar I disorder , recent episode depress ( 296.5x ) must meet following criterion : Is currently experience major depressive episode major depressive episode define DSMIVTR criterion within 60 day screen visit least one additional major depressive episode one manic hypomanic episode , define DSMIVTR criterion , within 3 year enrolment . A well documented history mixed episode meet DSMIVTR criterion may count previous episode.All subject must experience least one welldocumented manic mixed episode past . Has duration recent/current depressive episode least 2 week longer 12 month prior enrolment . The subject without current major depressive episode must major depressive episode within 60 day screen depressive symptom screen treatment depressive symptom , confirm medical record , etc .
