	<detailed_description>Primary : - To determine Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) Dasatinib relapse refractory Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) patient determine safety Dasatinib NHL Secondary Objective : - To assess complete overall response rate Phase I Phase II patient assay level kinase activity NHL specimens correlate activity patient outcomes . - To determine overall survival event free survival Phase I Phase II patient . Treatment Plan This study two phase treatment , Phase I Phase II . The Phase I portion trial consist dose escalation plan 3-6 patient enrol dose cohort . The dos Dasatinib use Phase I 100 mg , 150 mg , 200 mg . The dose find tolerated best also best treatment result use Phase II . An additional 29 patient enrol Phase II . All patient receive Dasatinib study . Dasatinib administer orally ( mouth ) daily 28 day cycle . A cycle consider 28 day . Dosing continuous interruption , unless instruct interrupt treatment treat physician . The patient restaged every 2 cycle therapy , every even cycle . Therapy may continue long clinical sign NHL progress patient tolerate treatment side effect related therapy . If patient remove study reason , he/she follow survival death .</detailed_description>
