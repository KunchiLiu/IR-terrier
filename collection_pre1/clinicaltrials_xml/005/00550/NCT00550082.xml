	<detailed_description>Background Significance : Scope Problem : VTE third common cardiovascular disease ( heart attack stroke common ) preventable medical problem among patient hospitalize illness . DVT often cause chronic venous insufficiency , potentially disable painful condition lower quality life . Acute PE may cause death disable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension . After discharge short-term hospital stay , one study report incidence DVT 48 per 100,000 incidence PE ( without DVT ) 23 per 100,000.9 In addition , incidence VTE increase dramatically age.10-11 Clinical manifestation DVT often include swell , pain , extremity discoloration may lead PE . Manifestations PE may include dyspnea , pleuritic pain , cough , hemoptysis may asymptomatic.12-13 The 28-day mortality rate first VTE event alarmingly high , approximately 11 % .14 In addition , 3-month mortality rate PE report high 17 % .15 However , appropriate prophylaxis—using anticoagulant , mechanical measure , anticoagulant plus mechanical measures—can prevent episode VTE16 . For example , mechanical measure simple `` low tech '' inexpensive graduate compression stocking reduce VTE rates.16a , 16b , 16c Burden Patients : VTE associate complication include recurrence DVT PE , chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension , death , subsequent development post-thrombotic syndrome . The risk VTE recurrence great within 6-12 month first event continue least 10 years,17 risk factor death PE.18 The post-thrombotic syndrome devastate effect patient ' quality life associate venous hypertension may cause pain , edema , skin change , varicose vein , skin ulcer . Valve dysfunction , lead venous hypertension , often cause previous DVT.19 The cumulative incidence development postthrombotic syndrome VTE event high : 17 % one year , 23 % 2 year , 29 % 8 year , 30 % case classify severe.20 Burden Society : Direct medical cost United States health care system relate VTE event complication approximate least $ 600 million annually . Bullano colleagues21 estimate manage care plan pay median $ 3,131 per incident DVT , $ 6,424 per incident PE , $ 12,200 DVT plus PE combination event . A 2004 registry 5,451 patient ultrasound-confirmed DVT 183 institution United States reveal DVT lead hospitalization 80 % diagnosed outpatient . Those initially diagnosed DVT inpatient remain hospitalized median 12 days.7 Role computerize healthcare delivery system : The use computerized physician order entry ( CPOE ) grow currently utilize 10 % U.S. Hospitals.22 When link clinical decision support , provide unique important tool improve ordering decision , thereby reduce medication error , transcribe error , decrease frequency adverse drug event , increase compliance evidence-based clinical guidelines.23 This lead overall improve patient care . There grow recognition importance utility CPOE technology , currently , concert effort nation-wide implement hospital private practice . CPOE program provide excellent platform increase implementation clinical practice guideline , thereby change physician behavior . At Brigham Women 's Hospital , develop electronic alert system , integrate CPOE system function independently . We create risk score criterion system determine risk DVT PE particular patient . All information need accomplish risk assessment store computer system , allow process run automate fashion . The system accord present criterion determine whether generate alert . To , system check existence current order prophylaxis , use Brigham Women 's Hospital CPOE system . The presence medication class order anticoagulants general care order mechanical prophylaxis prevents computer issue alert . We enhance computerized system produce series alert provide information relate prescription omission thromboprophylaxis . We aim test new system propose study . At Brigham Women 's Hospital , also leverage use multiple outpatient electronic medical record inpatient CPOE system facilitate process medication reconciliation , , hospital stay . This system aggregate medication data electronic medical record ( EMR ) CPOE system clinicians efficiently generate accurate pre-admission medication list . Information collect use application subsequently support write admission discharge order physician , performance admission assessment nurse , reconciliation inpatient order pharmacist . Medication histories thus seamlessly transfer transition care inpatient admission discharge home , rehabilitation , skilled nursing facility . This efficient system allow u carefully document use omission thromboprophylaxis order . Furthermore , 90 day follow-up , able track thromboprophylaxis prescription hospital discharge use combination Brigham Women 's Hospital 's pharmacy 's electronic outpatient prescription reconciliation program Partners ' internally developed EMR , Longitudinal Medical Record . The Longitudinal Medical Record use outpatient clinic record clinical visit information history , note , problem , medication , allergy , provide inpatient outpatient test result , include image test laboratory blood test , 7 Partners-affiliated institution : Brigham Women 's Hospital , Massachusetts General Hospital , Dana Farber Cancer Institute , Newton Wellesley Hospital , North Shore Medical Center , Faulkner Hospital , Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital . The Longitudinal Medical Record especially useful follow patient might undergo evaluation new problem , sudden onset shortness breath , suburban hospital Newton Wellesley Hospital , prior hospitalization Brigham Women 's Hospital treatment complicate medical illness high risk VTE . In 2005 randomized trial electronic alert VTE prophylaxis,8 rely upon Longitudinal Medical Record achieve 94 % follow-up 90 day patient enrol Brigham Women 's Hospital . Between 2000 2004 , develop computer generate alert system VTE prophylaxis test large randomize controlled trial Brigham Women 's Hospital . The system link patient database , identify patient high risk VTE ( define ≥ 4 score point show Table 1 ) receive prophylaxis . High-risk patient receive VTE prophylaxis randomize intervention group physicians receive electronic alert control group physician alert . Patients intervention group experience 41 % reduction incidence symptomatic VTE event within 90 day , without increase risk major minor bleeding . However , prophylactic measure prescribe 33.5 % patient intervention group . For remain patient ( 66.5 % ) , surprised physician decline implement suggest intervention , initiation VTE prophylaxis . There still considerable scope electronic methodology technology increase prophylaxis rate reduce rate VTE . Therefore , focus new study initiative improve current method strategy reduce incidence VTE . Significance propose study : Our project address several gap understand issue relate implementation VTE prophylaxis hospitalize patient . We aim identify subgroup hospitalize population especially high risk VTE . An improved novel automate electronic alerting system facilitate identification . Our new alert system much rigorous prior protocol . The new alert three sequential screen rather single alert screen prior version . This computerized system identify hospitalized patient high risk VTE analyze record determine whether receive thromboprophylaxis order . If system identify high-risk patient order thromboprophylaxis , series prompt issue order physician . The physician whose patient risk VTE request institute prophylaxis . If automate request follow , series alert query reason withhold preventive measure . Further prompt lead centralize computer-generated ordering graduate compression stocking , unless physician opts unselects order . Important element alert include up-to-date selection pharmacological agent , dos base renal clearance , documentation reason withhold prophylaxis order physician . We follow high-risk patient whose physician receive alert . We determine whether within 90 day , patient develop symptomatic DVT PE . The Longitudinal Medical Record facilitate follow-up hospital discharge . Through use novel alert system , identify patient high risk VTE , maximize implementation VTE prophylaxis , learn rationale physician ' withholding anticoagulant mechanical prophylaxis high-risk patient , test whether novel electronic intervention reduces clinically important episode PE DVT . The success program provide useful model dissemination VTE preventive strategy nationwide worldwide .</detailed_description>
