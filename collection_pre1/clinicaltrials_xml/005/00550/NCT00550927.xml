	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Enzastaurin may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Enzastaurin bevacizumab may also stop growth cancer cell block blood flow cancer . Giving enzastaurin together bevacizumab may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose enzastaurin bevacizumab treat patient locally advanced metastatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine recommended phase II dose enzastaurin hydrochloride bevacizumab may safely administer patient locally advance metastatic malignancy . - To characterize toxicity enzastaurin hydrochloride bevacizumab patient . - To document antitumor activity enzastaurin hydrochloride bevacizumab patient . - To evaluate pharmacokinetics enzastaurin hydrochloride bevacizumab patient . - To assess GSK3β biomarker relevant enzastaurin hydrochloride correlation clinical outcome patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study enzastaurin hydrochloride bevacizumab . Patients receive oral enzastaurin hydrochloride , twice , three time daily day 1-21 day 1-28 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 21 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect periodically study pharmacokinetic evaluation . Samples also analyze biomarker ( GSK3β ) ELISA . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day . National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) register trial Eli Lilly sponsor . NCI update record . In June 2012 , NCI transfer trial Lilly 's clinicaltrials.gov account Lilly update record trial status trial completion date . This trial applicable trial Food Drug Administration Amendments Act 2007 ( FDAAA ) .</detailed_description>
