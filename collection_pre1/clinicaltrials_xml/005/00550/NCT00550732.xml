	<brief_title>A Study Examine Efficacy Safety Posaconazole When Introduced Early Treatment Refractory Fungal Infections ( P05090 AM2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In past two decade , invasive fungal infection ( IFI ) become increasingly common among immunocompromised people , include solid-organ hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipient , HIV infection , hematological malignancy , individual immunosuppressive drug regimen . There high rate morbidity mortality associate IFI . Over past decade , increase resistance commonly use antifungal agent epidemiological shift drug-resistant strain . This demonstrate need development new generation azoles .</detailed_description>
