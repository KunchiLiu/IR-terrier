	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , panitumumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Panitumumab may also stop growth pancreatic cancer block blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well give panitumumab together gemcitabine erlotinib work compare give gemcitabine erlotinib alone treat patient metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Gemcitabine With Without Panitumumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess whether addition panitumumab ( dual-epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor ) standard chemotherapy comprise gemcitabine hydrochloride erlotinib hydrochloride result improvement overall survival patient previously untreated , metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas . Secondary - To compare objective response rate , progression-free survival , time treatment failure , quality life , adverse event rate patient treat regimen . - To evaluate downstream marker , KRAS , stool specimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) prior adjuvant chemotherapy ( yes v ) . The first 6 patient assign arm II . Subsequent patient randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) 2 course receive 2 additional course treatment ; patient achieve partial response ( PR ) receive retreatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve CR 4 course treatment receive maintenance therapy comprise erlotinib hydrochloride daily first disease progression . After first progression , patient retreat gemcitabine hydrochloride erlotinib hydrochloride second progression ( use first progression tumor measurement new baseline reference ) . - Arm II : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride erlotinib hydrochloride arm I panitumumab IV 1 hour day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course . Patients achieve CR 2 course receive 2 additional course treatment ; patient achieve PR receive retreatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve CR 4 course treatment receive maintenance therapy comprise erlotinib hydrochloride daily panitumumab every 2 week first disease progression . After first progression , patient retreat gemcitabine hydrochloride , erlotinib hydrochloride , panitumumab second progression ( use first progression tumor measurement new baseline reference ) . Stool sample collect baseline analyze KRAS mutation via protein analysis . Quality life assess baseline , every 2 course treatment , end treatment . After second progression , patient follow every 3-6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
