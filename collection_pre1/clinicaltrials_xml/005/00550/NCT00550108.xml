	<brief_title>Management Incidentally Discovered Pancreatic Cysts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The appropriate management patient cystic lesion pancreas controversial . The identification small asymptomatic pancreatic cyst increase due improvement quality radiologic image frequency imaging obtain . However , natural history lesion unknown1 . The current consensus guideline establish International Consensus Conference Sendai , Japan 2005 suggest branch chain IPMNs mucinous cystic neoplasm cause symptom , measure &lt; 3cm , nodule observe periodic imaging . However , time course pre malignant mucinous lesion , intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMN ) mucinous cystadenomas , benign malignant determine . Due unknown natural history , diagnostic uncertainty , author recommend routine resection2 , 3 . Resection , despite improvement surgical outcome pancreatectomy high volume center , carry mortality morbidity 1-6 % 35-51 % , respectively4-6 . More recently study report selective approach avoid risk operation patient benign lesions7 . Improved radiographic endoscopic study able identify lesion increase malignant potential8 , 9 . Thus , patient undergo pancreas specific radiologic image endoscopic ultrasound cyst aspiration . Since natural history cystic lesion poorly understand clear guideline surgical resection establish . Some cyst grow time , increase cumulative risk malignancy . Therefore , therapeutic alternative wait watch change cyst morphology treat preemptively , restrict surgical resection . Based pilot study perform Dr. William Brugge , Massachusetts General Hospital , ethanol lavage pancreatic cyst safe result decrease cyst diameter 61 % patient . Additionally , patient elect treat preemptively unclear best follow patient term type frequency follow study .</detailed_description>
