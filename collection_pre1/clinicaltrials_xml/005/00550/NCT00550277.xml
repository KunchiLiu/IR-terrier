	<brief_summary>Inhibition histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) provide novel approach cancer treatment . LBH589 , oral HDAC inhibitor , well tolerated phase I trials show activity several type cancer . In nonrandomized phase II trial , investigate activity LBH589 treatment patient refractory clear cell renal carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LBH589 Treatment Refractory Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inhibition histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) provide potential target cancer treatment . Histones component core protein nucleosomes , acetylation deacetylation protein play role regulation gene expression . HDAC activity know increase many type malignant cell ; HDAC inhibitor show induce differentiation , cell cycle arrest , apoptosis culture tumor cell . Since tumor-associated mechanism common many type cancer , HDAC may broad role cancer treatment .</detailed_description>
