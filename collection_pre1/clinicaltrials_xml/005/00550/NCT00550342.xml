	<brief_title>Rituximab Treatment Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) remain enigmatic disease despite many year study . There recent increase incidence FSGS particularly African Americans outcome tends worse . In 30 % patient transplanted FSGS , disease recurs often result severe nephrotic syndrome accelerate graft loss . FSGS common cause nephrotic disease account 10-20 % case idiopathic nephrotic syndrome child 35 % case adult . Most case refractory current therapy result ultimate progression end stage renal disease . Overall , FSGS account 15 % pediatric 5 % adult case end stage renal disease . With frequent post transplant recurrence , morbidity mortality FSGS increase . Thus , FSGS disease associate large cost society long-term morbidity individual patient . A treatment could induce permanent remission reverse organ damage would make major contribution society reduction expense . A circulate Permeability Factor ( PF , Savin Factor ) suspect central pathogenesis recurrent disease identity difficult discern . The molecular weight report 30 100 kDa . Although , PF report adhere protein A column column part treatment FSGS , molecular weight would exclude PF intact antibody . Immunosuppressive agent therapy demonstrate efficacy , albeit partial , suggest least case FSGS immune mediate . While high dose steroid first line treatment FSGS , cyclosporine efficacious randomize trial use steroid resistant FSGS associate substantial toxicity . If cyclosporine fails , cyclophosphamide , plasmapheresis , protein A immunoabsorption , recently mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) use variable efficacy . Rituximab , primarily indicate treatment lymphoma , become first line agent treatment post transplant lymphoma . However , use increase frequency treat various autoimmune disease include rheumatoid arthritis think primarily T-cell mediate others immune thrombocytopenia purpura think primarily B-cell mediate . In trial conduct Immune Tolerance Network , ANCA positive vasculitis treat rituximab appear short course rituximab lead tolerance autoimmune disease . Rituximab 's mechanism action various autoimmune disease efficacy variously suggest result elimination either circulate autoantibody , elimination B-cell produce cytokine , interference antigen presentation provide B cell . We recently case immediate post transplant recurrence FSGS child fail respond MMF , steroid , long-term plasmapheresis conversion tacrolimus cyclosporine . The FSGS associate proteinuria however completely resolve 6 month treatment post transplant lymphoma 6 dos rituximab . A similar case also resolve treatment PTLD rituximab recently report . While mechanism action cyclosporine MMF unknown FSGS , drug show activity B cell . The response see two recent case follow treatment B cell specific agent lead hypothesis least case FSGS autoimmune mechanism B cell play central role . We propose test hypothesis treatment patient recurrent primary persistent FSGS rituximab . This study single center , single-arm , pilot trial . As study register clintrials.gov , subject may refer outside physician . However , treatment do IU GCRC . After meet inclusion/exclusion criterion sign consent , serum PF level , blood B cell flow cytometry obtain . Rituximab ( 375 mg/m2 ) administer intravenously per current package label facility capable handle infusion reaction . Subjects would pre dosed diphenhydramine acetaminophen . Solu-Medrol , 1.5 mg/kg would dose 1 hour prior first dose rituximab . Three subsequent dos rituximab give weekly interval . Study visit conduct monthly thereafter 6 month every 3 month , time , assessment safety make . Efficacy determine monitor first AM Uprotein/C ratio . Flow cytometry , PF factor , urine proteomics general blood work include CBC , Chemistry , electrolytes , serum immunoglobulin also do . During second year , subject would follow every three month . The primary endpoint resolution proteinuria define Up/C ratio &lt; 0.2 . Secondary endpoint number subject achieve partial remission define fall 50 % Up/C ratio pre-treatment baseline ; number patient develop recurrence increase proteinuria sample obtain least 4 week apart ; effect treatment PF level ; safety measure infection drug infusion reaction . Consideration give plan redo subject relapse initial response .</detailed_description>
