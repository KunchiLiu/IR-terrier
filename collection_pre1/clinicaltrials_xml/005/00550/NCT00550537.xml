	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample tumor tissue , blood , urine laboratory patient receive erlotinib may help doctor predict patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : The phase II trial study proteomic profiling see well predicts response patient receive erlotinib stage IIIB , stage IV , recurrent non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proteomic Profiling Predicting Response Patients Receiving Erlotinib Stage IIIB , Stage IV , Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To define pre-treatment tumor proteomic profile predicts response , stable disease , progressive disease patient stage IIIB , stage IV , recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treat erlotinib hydrochloride . Secondary - To test refine pre-treatment serum proteomic expression pattern predict response erlotinib hydrochloride and/or carboplatin paclitaxel fail treatment erlotinib hydrochloride . - To test refine tumor proteomic profile predict response carboplatin paclitaxel fail treatment erlotinib hydrochloride . - To analyze individual pattern ( ) erlotinib hydrochloride-induced genomic proteomic biomarker change relation response non-response treatment . - To correlate efficacy toxicity erlotinib hydrochloride expression EGFR , EGFR pathway , ErbB family , related biomarkers . - To determine set biomarkers evaluate tumor tissue surrogate tissue prior treatment erlotinib hydrochloride enable patient selection therapy . - To estimate response rate progression-free overall survival patient treat erlotinib hydrochloride initial therapy . - To characterize safety profile erlotinib hydrochloride patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily disease progression . At time disease progression , patient receive standard chemotherapy comprise paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 15-30 minute day 1 . Patients non-squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course . Tumor tissue , plasma , serum , urine sample collect baseline proteomics analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 8 week .</detailed_description>
