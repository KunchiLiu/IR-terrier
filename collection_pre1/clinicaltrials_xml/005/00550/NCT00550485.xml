	<brief_summary>The ABCB1-gene product P-glycoprotein integral membrane protein actively transport substrate intracellular compartment . One major site action blood-brain-barrier . It highly express brain capillary endothelial cell involve limit access substrates antidepressant CNS . A single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) ABCB1-gene recently identify show different treatment response antidepressant drug depend genotype . Therefore , assume healthy subject different genotype SNP associate significantly different brain level antidepressant escitalopram 6 day intake . For determine intracerebral escitalopram level , 19-F magnetic resonance spectroscopy use . Sleep recording useful bio-marker effect antidepressant CNS . Selective 5-HT1-reuptake inhibitor ( e.g . escitalopram ) cause suppression REM sleep strong fragmentation sleep compare untreated subject . Higher plasma level antidepressant affect sleep great extent low level . In line finding , suppose sleep EEG recording healthy subject different genotype mention SNP differently affect take 6 day escitalopram . In addition , good evidence sleep involve various form memory processing . For example , repeatedly show performance motor task ( procedural learning ) correlate amount stage 2 NonREM REM sleep , respectively . Hence hypothesize , drug-induced impairment sleep ( e. g. reduction REM sleep ) associate impairment procedural learning . In addition , effect drug intake gene expression lymphocytes metabolic change assess . Functional magnetic resonance image apply detect potential drug-induced change corticolimbic circuitry .</brief_summary>
