	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion skin near anus cause human papillomavirus ( HPV ) . Antiviral drug , , cidofovir , act virus may stop lesion become cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well topical cidofovir work treat HIV-infected patient high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion skin near anus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cidofovir Treating HIV-Infected Patients With High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions Skin Near Anus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate safety tolerability topical cidofovir HIV-infected patient perianal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( HSIL ) . - To estimate regression rate perianal HSIL patient treat regimen . Secondary - To determine human papilloma virus ( HPV ) DNA type HPV strain variant present perianal HSIL normal perianal tissue . - To determine clinical regression perianal HSIL associate clearance HPV DNA . - To identify HPV DNA type present anus cervix compare HPV DNA present perianus order determine HPV type associate perianal lesion infect anus cervix . - To determine abnormally methylated gene perianal HSIL compare normal perianal tissue gene different previously identify anal cervical dysplasia . - To determine whether methylated gene change treatment cidofovir . - To characterize difference gene expression perianal HSIL compare normal perianal tissue . - To examine change gene expression perianal HSIL exposure cidofovir use RNA microarray analysis confirm result real-time polymerase chain reaction . - To correlate pretreatment CD4 count , viral load , lesion size , methylation pattern , and/or HPV type strain clinical efficacy topical cidofovir . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients apply topical cidofovir perianus daily day 1-5 . Patients undergo punch biopsy pretreatment lesional biopsy site day 14 . Beginning 2-4 week biopsy , patient receive course 2 cidofovir therapy . Subsequent treatment repeat every 14 day 6 courses* absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients receive total 6 course study therapy . Patients undergo collection tumor normal tissue histopathological molecular correlative study . Punch biopsy obtain baseline , first course therapy , 6 week completion therapy . Tissue sample examine histopathology , human papilloma virus ( HPV ) DNA typing , DNA methylation , gene expression ( via RNA microarray analysis polymerase chain reaction ) . After completion study therapy , patient follow 6 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : Histologically confirm perianal highgrade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( HSIL ) within past 12 week The perianal skin ( i.e. , perianus ) define extend radially 5 cm anal verge Lesions must cover surface area ≥ 3 square centimeter Lesions extend outside perianus ( e.g. , vulvar lesion posterior perineum border perianus ) allow Serologic documentation HIV infection AND meet 1 follow criterion : Has stable highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) ≥ 12 week prior study entry Has CD4 count &gt; 200/mm³ AND receive antiretroviral therapy OR currently receive nonHAART* antiretroviral regimen plan initiate HAART within next 12 week NOTE : * A nonHAART regimen consider therapy include protease inhibitor nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor No untreated invasive cancer lower genital tract No concurrent neoplasia require cytotoxic therapy PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : Karnofsky performance status 70100 % Life expectancy ≥ 3 month Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL ANC ≥ 1,000/mm³ Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm³ Creatinine &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Total conjugate ( direct ) bilirubin ≤ 2.5 time ULN AST ALT ≤ 3 time ULN Not pregnant nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patient must use effective contraception 3 month completion study therapy No acute , opportunistic infection oral thrush , yeast vaginitis , genital herpes within past 14 day PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : See Disease Characteristics Recovered prior ablative surgical treatment perianal dysplasia At least 4 week since prior topical treatment perianal dysplasia If prior treatment cause significant trauma ther area , heal occur prior start treatment More 14 day since prior acute treatment infection ( oral thrush , yeast vaginitis , genital herpes ) serious medical illness No concurrent corticosteroid replacement dose No concurrent investigational drug except INDapproved antiretroviral agent No concurrent systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy</criteria>
