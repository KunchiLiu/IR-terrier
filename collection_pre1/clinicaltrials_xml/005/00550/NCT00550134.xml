	<brief_summary>Patients cancer often complain `` mind seem clear . '' This due stress , depression , anxiety , physical problem cause cancer treatment use control symptom . There many purpose study ; one learn effect cancer treatment brain , another identify useful tool detect effect . The result study may stimulate new research compare different treatment current treatment researcher may learn treat symptom effectively improve patient quality life . We would also like learn effect chemotherapy may DNA .</brief_summary>
