	<brief_summary>This parallel group , randomize , double blind , placebo control , multicentre study design ass whether vandetanib ( ZD6474 ) confers improvement PFS compare placebo subject locally advance metastatic papillary follicular thyroid carcinoma fail unsuitable radioiodine therapy . The trial sufficient size vandetanib ( ZD6474 ) truly active high probability demonstrate effect sufficiently promise warrant follow-up assessment . - Subjects see weekly first 2 week , Week 4 , Week 8 , Week 12 randomization , every 12 week thereafter . Upon disease progression , subject ( active placebo ) unblinded give option discontinue blind study treatment enter follow survival , begin open label vandetanib ( ZD6474 ) 300 mg treatment . All subject follow collect survival data ≥50 % subject die . Subjects take vandetanib ( ZD6474 ) time study closure wish remain therapy allow continue long Investigator feel obtain clinical benefit , give another anti-cancer therapy . The safety data subject assess ongoing basis , include discontinuation follow . - Radiologic evaluation use RECIST criterion perform every 12 week ( ± 2 week ) . All medical image centralize assessed site centrally review . Subjects evaluated progression , follow survival , regardless whether continue randomized treatment , unless withdraw consent . Post progression open-label vandetanib ( ZD6474 ) offer investigator discretion . - All subject must submit suitable archived tumor sample prior randomization . In event suitable archived sample available within 2 week prior randomization , fresh tumor sample must obtain place prior randomization . If subject undergoes fresh tumor biopsy procedure , specimen satisfy first optional tumor biopsy submission consent exploratory part study .</brief_summary>
