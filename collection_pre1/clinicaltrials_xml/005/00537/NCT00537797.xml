	<brief_title>Accuracy FDG-PET Scanning Diagnose Malignant Thyroid Nodules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While FNA sensitive test diagnose thyroid tumor , differentiate benign malignant follicular nodule sometimes yield equivocal result due inadequate sampling indeterminate cytology . The standard care patient equivocal follicular histology surgical removal nodule , benign nature . FDG-PET , evidence prior experience study group , may application discriminate benign malignant disease patient equivocal follicular FNA result use standardized uptake value determination . We demonstrate feasibility preliminary clinical utility use limited neck FDG-PET exam patient indeterminate thyroid nodule pilot study . The purpose trial prospectively evaluate large series patient equivocal follicular histology FNA accurately define sensitivity specificity FDG-PET diagnostic imaging nodule . In addition , utility modality identify metastatic focus patient thyroid cancer follicular equivocal histology FNA assess . If sensitivity specificity modality determine high ( â‰¥95 % ) diagnosing malignant nodule patient , many patient benign disease may potentially benefit avoid unnecessary operation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Documented history solitary thyroid nodule dominant nodule within multinodular disease , fine needle aspiration demonstrate follicular indeterminate cytologic examination . If core needle biopsy perform instead fine needle aspiration , demonstrate follicular indeterminate cytology , patient eligible biopsy procedure felt minimally disruptive nodule architecture , base review PI nuclear medicine investigator . Thyroid nodule must palpable physical examination minimum size 1 cm diameter ultrasonography , CT MRI . The minimum size criterion establish address spatial resolution limitation PET/CT imaging . Scheduled surgical excision thyroid nodule within 3 month date FDGPET/CT scan . Ability tolerate lie supine FDGPET/CT examination . Age &gt; /= 18 &lt; /= 105 ( This disease rare child therefore study limited adult . ) Willing participate aspect study ( patient may opt tissue collection portion . ) Patient must euthyroid serum TSH free T4 level within institutional upper low limit normal , measure within 6 month registration . NOTE : mild deviation institutional normal limit may consider acceptable patient achieve clinically euthyroid state medication stable dose &gt; 3 month , TSH consider target patient 's treating physician . In patient hyperthyroidism require treatment , euthyroid state may achieve administration thionamide propylthiouracil prior FDGPET/CT exam . Patients hyperthyroid inflammatory condition thyroiditis toxic multinodular goiter often exhibit increased glucose uptake result diffuse uptake FDG may obscure visualization thyroid tumor . If female , patient must negative pregnancy test time registration , postmenopausal ( period last twelve month ) , tubal ligation least twelve month ago , hysterectomy . In patient multinodular disease dominant nodule , nuclear medicine physician responsible FDGPET/CT scan interpretation must determine whether indeterminate nodule discriminate FDGPET/CT image prior enrollment . A signed date write informed consent obtain patient patient 's legally acceptable representative prior study participation . Patient fast glucose level &gt; 200 mg/dL time PET/CT scan Patient prior neck surgery radiation opinion investigator disrupt tissue architecture thyroid Patient evidence infection localize neck 14 day prior FDGPET/CCT scan Patient meet inclusion criterion</criteria>
