	<brief_summary>The goal anti-HIV therapy prevent HIV replicating . Long-term control HIV require least two anti-HIV drug active virus . Drug resistance problem many treatment-experienced , HIV-infected people . The purpose study determine benefit add nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) new anti-HIV drug regimen suppression HIV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two fully active antiretrovirals ( ARVs ) recommend successful suppression HIV . In people infected resistant HIV virus , find two drug fully active HIV challenge . However , new generation anti-HIV drug design suppress drug-resistant HIV . These drug include FDA-approved protease inhibitor ( PIs ) darunavir tipranavir , investigational non-nucleoside transcriptase inhibitor ( nNRTI ) etravirine , FDA-approved fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide , recently FDA-approved CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc , investigational integrase inhibitor raltegravir . Also , yet know whether multiple , partially-active drug rate success suppress HIV . The purpose study use HIV resistance test predict potency suggest ARV regimen use second generation ARVs determine benefit add NRTIs new drug regimen outweigh risk drug toxicity pill burden . All participant treatment experience resistance NRTIs , nNRTIs , PIs , receive novel agent . An active screening period ( enrollment randomization treatment dispensation ) , occur 75 day participant , study participation last additional 96 week qualify either randomization assignment ( i.e . randomize ) , study intervention . During active screening , participant remain current drug regimen . During screening , phenotypic genotypic HIV resistance test perform participant ' blood sample , well coreceptor tropism assay . Using information medication history , study team determine best new regimen option participant . Each clinician , along study participant , choose new regimen base recommendation study team participant 's preference . Evaluation study outcome begin participant start new regimen assign either randomization determine assignment . Stratification Arms A ( Add NRTIs ) B ( Omit NRTIs ) Arm C ( Non-randomized Add NRTIs ) base predict activity new regimen . Those assigned regimen higher predicted activity randomly assign Arm A ( Add NRTIs ) B ( Omit NRTIs ) ; assign regimen predict low activity randomize , assign Arm C ( Add NRTIs ) . Participants Arms A C instructed take newly assign study regimen plus least 2 NRTIs ( personalize expert recommendation choice local provider participant ) 96 week . Participants Arm B instruct take newly assign study regimen NRTIs 96 week . Participants arm meet primary efficacy outcome regimen failure remain study order follow important secondary outcome . All participant schedule 13 clinical visit , include blood collection . At visit , urine collection quality life adherence questionnaire occur . A neurocognitive assessment perform participant time start new study regimen . Participants may also consent cerebrospinal fluid collect via lumbar puncture follow study treatment assignment and/or Week 24 . Those participant consent cerebrospinal fluid collection also neurocognitive assessment time collection . Participants responsible obtain certain ARVs provide study , include ARVs active screening period . The primary secondary study objective comparison relate randomize arm , therefore , result provide non-randomized arm ( C ) . The purpose non-randomized arm ( C ) include person high baseline resistance ( thus , low activity score ) order address exploratory objective relate predictive power activity score ( thus large range score inclusion arm C ) , certain , virologic outcome .</detailed_description>

More information criterion find protocol . Chronic , active hepatitis B virus infection ( hepatitis B surface antigen positive HBV DNA positive ) Taking certain medication . More information criterion find protocol . Known allergy/sensitivity component two studyprovided drug formulation . For maraviroc , include hypersensitivity history allergy soy lecithin peanut . Active drug alcohol use , opinion investigator , may interfere study Pregnancy breastfeed Use immunomodulator ( interferon , interleukin , systemic corticosteroid , cyclosporine ) , vaccine , investigational therapy within 30 day prior study treatment allocation/assignment Require certain medication prohibit study treatment Serious illness require systemic treatment hospitalization . Participants complete therapy clinically stable therapy least 14 day prior study treatment allocation exclude .</criteria>
