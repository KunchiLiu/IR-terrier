	<criteria>Subjects ( male female ) must &gt; 18 year â‰¤ 80 year age , diagnosis epilepsy partial seizure , define International League Against Epilepsy ( ILAE ) classification seizure ; partial seizure may simple complex , without secondary tonicclonic generalization . Subjects must diagnose epilepsy least 2 year , must unresponsive treatment least two five prior antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) , time study enrollment stable dosages 1 2 standard AEDs . They must 12 lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) without clinically significant abnormal finding prior randomization . Subjects must magnetic resonance image contrast enhance compute tomography scan brain demonstrate progressive structural central nervous system abnormality time diagnosis epilepsy . Women childbearing potential must establish effective method contraception study . Women also negative pregnancy test prior study entry . During 6week baseline period , subject must minimum four partial seizure , 28 day period free partial seizure without secondary generalization . A caregiver witness must subject sufficient duration accurately chronicle occurrence seizure . These seizure must document subject 's diary . Subjects electroencephalograph ( EEG ) test do within 2 year randomization . EEG abnormalities consistent diagnosis focalonset epilepsy . Signed date informed consent obtain subject ( include able consent ) accordance local regulatory legal requirement .

Subjects willing , need assistance self administer questionnaire may consider acceptable , must first discussed casebycase basis Pfizer monitor prior screen test procedure study . Females pregnant , breastfeeding , intend become pregnant course trial . Subjects neurologic illness could impair endpoint assessment , patient LennoxGastaut syndrome , absence seizure , status epilepticus within 12 month prior study entry , seizure due underlie medical illness metabolic syndrome . Subjects clinically significant liver disease calculate creatinine clearance &lt; 60mL/min . Subjects history lack response , hypersensitivity poor tolerability gabapentin pregabalin . Previous use gabapentin pregabalin within 2 week prior screen likelihood engage treatment study period . Use prohibit medication list protocol absence appropriate washout phase likelihood require treatment study period drug permit study protocol . Participation study involve investigational market product , concomitantly within 30 day prior entry study . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate trial participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation trial result , judgment investigator , would make subject inappropriate entry trial . Subjects suitable treated pregabalin gabapentin accord respective local labeling . Subjects history retinal abnormality treatment retinotoxic agent .</criteria>
