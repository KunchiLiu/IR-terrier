Mid Region pro Adrenomedullin ( MR-proADM ) superior BNP prognosis heart failure ( HF ) patient add incremental value predict outcome patient present Emergency Department ( ED ) shortness breath . 2 . Mid Region pro A-Type Natriuretic Peptide ( MR-proANP ) non-inferior BNP diagnosis HF patient present ED shortness breath .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The diagnosis heart failure often difficult . Clinical history often vague , physical examination finding suffer lack specificity sensitivity . For example , symptom like shortness breath edema often present patient without cardiac disease , elevate jugular venous pressure difficult visualize auscultation third heart sound challenge hear , especially emergency room set . Although BNP level sometimes help clarify clinical picture patient present acutely shortness breath , patient without heart failure may BNP value fall `` gray zone '' , diagnosis still much question . Also , difficulty interpret BNP level patient renal dysfunction , patient high body mass index , patient advance age . Investigative test emergency department electrocardiogram chest x-ray also non-specific diagnose heart failure . Tests echocardiography , accurate assessment leave ventricular dysfunction , expensive always available emergent basis ; furthermore , presence heart failure normal systolic function ( a.k.a . diastolic dysfunction ) complicate interpretation echocardiogram . Additionally , patient systolic dysfunction urgent echocardiogram mean acute dyspnea due heart failure , test may accurately reflect acute situation hand . Another difficult diagnostic dilemma arise patient history heart failure present sign could also consistent acute respiratory illness pneumonia . Often , patient background heart failure elevate BNP level baseline . In set , chest radiograph especially difficult interpret one must distinguish edema infiltrates , possibly . For reason , press need additional tool help u differentiate heart failure cause dyspnea acutely short breath patient , improve ability provide accurate prognostic information sound therapeutic management heart failure patient .</detailed_description>
