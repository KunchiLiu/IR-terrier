	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To assess ratio sensitivity OraTest® combination visual examination versus visual examination alone detection serious pathology define severe dysplasia , CIS , cancer O/OP cavity patient high risk squamous cell carcinoma , carcinoma situ , severe dysplasia oral/oropharyngeal ( O/OP ) cavity due age lifestyle risk factor . 2 . To estimate adjusted specificity OraTest® combination visual examination detection severe dysplasia , CIS , cancer O/OP cavity . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To assess ratio sensitivity OraTest® combination visual examination versus visual examination alone detection certain chromosomal abnormality ( 17p chromosomal deletion , 3p 9p chromosomal deletion ) , severe dysplasia , CIS , cancer O/OP cavity patient high risk squamous cell carcinoma , carcinoma situ , severe dysplasia oral/oropharyngeal ( O/OP ) cavity due age lifestyle risk factor . 2 . To obtain adjusted specificity OraTest® combination visual examination detection certain chromosomal abnormality ( 17p chromosomal deletion , 3p 9p chromosomal deletion ) , severe dysplasia , CIS cancer O/OP cavity . 3 . To evaluate chromosomal status positively stain lesion respect 3p , 9p , 17p deletion . 4 . To carry gene expression study biopsies map onto analysis widespread chromosomal imbalance stain-positive stain-negative lesion . 5 . To evaluate quantitative qualitative toxicity , well safety parameter , tolonium chloride 5 mg/mL ( OraTest® ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OraTest® blue dye design stain cancer cell differently normal cell . SCHEDULED EVALUATION ( FIRST VISIT ) : Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . Your medical history record . Women able child must negative urine pregnancy test . Your heart rate , breathing , temperature , blood pressure measure well first visit . Visual Exam - If find eligible take part study , visual examination doctor ( Examiner # 1 ) look inside mouth carefully look abnormal lesion check gland neck . This call visual exam . Rinse Staining Procedure ( OraTest® ) - A second doctor ( Examiner # 2 ) perform another oral exam , follow new test use OraTest® . This new test use blue dye may stain potential cancer blue may make easy doctor detect abnormal lesion mouth . You ask intensely-colored sweet like lollipops drink like black currant juice within 24 hour schedule visit . First rinse mouth 6 teaspoon vinegar solution 20 second spit . Next rinse mouth 6 teaspoon water 20 second spit . Then rinse mouth 2 teaspoon OraTest® 20 second spit . Then rinse mouth 6 teaspoon vinegar solution 20 second spit . Then rinse mouth 6 teaspoon water 20 second spit . Examiner 2 check see abnormal tissue absorb dye . If suspicious lesion find either doctor , complete study . You ask notify clinic , phone , side effect occur within 7 day visit . If unable phone clinic , give diary card record side effect . The diary card mail doctor pre-stamped envelope give . If suspicious lesion find either doctor ( ) , ask return 2 week confirm result . This call Confirmation Exam . CONFIRMATION EXAM ( SECOND VISIT ) : At visit confirm result , examine doctor ( ) find suspicious lesion ( ) . The doctor ( ) use examination method use first visit . Your heart rate , breathing , temperature , blood pressure measure well second visit . If suspicious lesion , specialist M. D. Anderson biopsy lesion ( ) , second visit within 5 day visit . During biopsy , doctor may use OraTest® cotton swab help locate suspicious spot . If dye use biopsy visit , heart rate , breathing , temperature , blood pressure measure use OraTest® . After locate spot , doctor perform biopsy . This mean tissue line mouth suspicious area remove . Some tissue send laboratory diagnosis . Your doctor decide type care may need base result biopsy . The biopsy procedure standard practice may happen even participate study . After biopsy take lesion , complete study . If suspicious lesion find require biopsy , sample tissue biopsy send laboratory outside M.D . Anderson review diagnosis . Medical research include genetic testing , chromosomal analysis test may perform biopsy . These sample return tissue destroy genetic test . Before tissue send outside laboratory name personal identifying information cod protect privacy . M. D. Anderson oversight leftover tissue and/or blood bank BRT Laboratories Inc. additional research . If suspicious lesion see second visit , complete study . If dye use exam , ask notify clinic phone side effect occur within 7 day visit . If unable phone clinic , give diary card record side effect . The diary card mail doctor pre-stamped envelope give . This investigational study . OraTest® yet FDA approve commercial use . All study procedure OraTest® provide free charge ; Sponsor pay study drug pregnancy test necessary . If standard care need ( example , due abnormality find ) , and/or insurance company responsible cost . Insurance company Medicare may pay cost research study like one . If insurance company cover cost care , pay cost . You right ask cost take part study treatment . If withdraw study early , pay portion study complete . Up 4000 patient take part multicenter study . Up 50 enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
