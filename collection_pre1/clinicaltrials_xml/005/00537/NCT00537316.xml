	<brief_summary>Part 1 study 3-arm , randomize , active-controlled , parallel-group , multicenter , double-blind , double-dummy , 16-week study compare efficacy safety infliximab ( IFX ) , monotherapy combination azathioprine ( AZA ) versus AZA monotherapy adult moderate severe active ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . Participants qualify Baseline Visit eligible randomize one three active treatment group . Participants IFX/AZA combination therapy IFX monotherapy cohort receive IFX infusion Weeks 0 , 2 , 6 daily oral AZA/placebo , respectively ; participant AZA cohort receive daily oral AZA placebo infusion Weeks 0 , 2 , 6 . At Week 8 , participant evaluate response . Participants respond IFX treatment Week 8 , either monotherapy combination AZA , receive one IFX infusion Week 14 ; non-responders IFX therapy receive placebo infusion Weeks 8 10 one additional IFX infusion Week 14 . Participants respond AZA monotherapy Week 8 continue AZA therapy receive one placebo infusion Week 14 ; nonresponders AZA eligible receive IFX Weeks 8 , 10 , 14 . Part 2 : Participants remission IFX monotherapy IFX/AZA treatment Week 16 randomize either maintenance intermittent open-label IFX treatment ; randomization stratify base oral AZA/placebo treatment Part 1 . Oral AZA/placebo treatment continue double-blinded . All participant continue receive oral AZA/ placebo duration study . Participants randomize maintenance IFX treatment receive schedule IFX infusion every 8 week begin Week 22 ( Week 6 direct entry ) . If participant lose response , treatment discontinue adverse event , participant consider treatment failure , follow safety schedule 6-month visit ( Weeks 38 , 62 , 94 [ Weeks 22 , 46 , 78 direct entry ] ) . These participant receive standard care per personal physician . Participants randomize intermittent IFX treatment evaluate every 8 week . Participants receive IFX upon relapse disease . Treatment IFX initiate Weeks 0 , 2 , 6 individual treatment cycle continue every 8 week remission regain . Throughout study , individual treatment cycle repeat whenever subject relapse . In addition , facilitate enrollment Part 2 , participant receive treatment outside Part 1 remission IFX without AZA/6-mercaptopurine ( 6-MP ) allow enter directly Part 2 . In Czech Republic , direct entry Part 2 study allow . A high expected incidence serious infusion reaction observe intermittent treatment arm another study ( Protocol P04563 , NCT0358670 ) conduct participant moderate severe psoriasis result termination study . Based similarity study design intermittent treatment arm P04563 intermittent treatment arm Part 2 study , enrollment Part 2 study put hold , precautionary reason . At time , participant already enrol intermittent treatment arm Part 2 ask discontinue trial . In October 2009 , decision make sponsor terminate whole study ( Part 1 2 ) . At time , participant enrol Part 1 study allow complete treatment Week 16 .</brief_summary>
