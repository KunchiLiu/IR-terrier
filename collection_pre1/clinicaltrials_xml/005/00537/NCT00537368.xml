	<brief_title>First Study Safety CNTO 888 Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CNTO 888 monoclonal antibody . Antibodies substances body involve many biological process . CNTO 888 think work block protein call CC-Chemokine Ligand 2 ( CCL2 ) . In research study CCL2 show increase growth new blood vessel help tumor survive . When new blood vessel grow , tumor get food oxygen need grow . Blocking CCL2 may help fight disease.This study consist two part , Part A Part B . In Part A , five different group patient treat five different , increase dose level CNTO 888 . In Part B , two dose level CNTO 888 test different treatment schedule . CNTO 888 give intravenous ( vein ) infusion . Between 1 30 patient advanced cancer take part Part A study . Between 24 33 patient advanced cancer take part Part B study.There three phase part A study . Screening phase , may last 4 week . Treatment phase , may last 8 week ( 4 treatment ) extend extra 9 week ( 4 extra treatment ) case patient 's tumor get big . The total treatment period could 17 week . Follow phase include end treatment visit 4 week last infusion CNTO 888 , visit week 18 last infusion well long term collection follow data . After Part A complete , two dos select evaluation part B . In Part B , patient place one 3 study group . There three phase Part B study . The screening phase , may last 4 week . The treatment phase , may last 9 week ( 4 treatment ) . If patient 's tumor get big , patient 's treatment phase may extend 12 week ( 4 treatment ) . The total treatment period could 21 week . The follow phase include end treatment visit 4 week last infusion CNTO 888 , visit week 18 last infusion well long-term collection follow data . Safety effectiveness evaluation perform specify interval throughout study consist laboratory test , vital sign ( blood pressure ) , physical examination collection information occurrence severity adverse event . In Part A study , patient receive either 0.3 , 1.0 , 3.0 , 10 , 15 mg/kg CNTO 888 . The time first second infusion 4 week , follow infusion give 2 week apart . Patients eligible Part B assign either low dose select Part A , give every 2 week high dose select Part A give either every 2 week every 3 week . All patient may study 18 week last infusion .</detailed_description>
