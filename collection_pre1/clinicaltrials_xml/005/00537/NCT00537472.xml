	<brief_summary>This study plan investigate whether reduce dose bupivacaine ( local anesthetic numb drug ) inject spinal space total knee replacement result short time discharge recovery room maintain adequate surgical anesthesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Dose Spinal Bupivacaine Total Knee Replacement Recovery Room Wait Time</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With dos bupivacaine currently use spinal anesthetic institution , patient ' sensory block often much high need achieve adequate surgical anesthesia . This translate prolonged wait period recovery room level regress pre-existing standard discharge ward , well pre-existing level post-operative nerve block extend pain relief perform . This prolonged period recovery room lead general delay operate room usage thus surgical cancellation . The excessive drug dos currently use also put patient risk increase side effect include low blood pressure , slow heart rate , nausea vomit . By use reduce dose bupivacaine spinal anesthetic one side knee replacement , hope significantly reduce recovery room wait time criteria recovery room discharge completion post-operative nerve block meet , still provide adequate surgical anesthesia . Patients receive either 9 mg ( intervention dose ) 13 mg ( control dose ) bupivacaine spinal injection . Once patient enter recovery room surgery level sensory block test per usual protocol recovery room nurse every 15 minute predefined level reach , two group compare .</detailed_description>
