	<brief_summary>This trial provide unique opportunity combine genomic , proteomic pharmacogenomic assessment patient receive chemotherapy advance breast cancer . To date trial analyze gene protein expression time point patient , combined clinical outcome . Similar previous attempt predict response base expression single gene protein , expect neither genomic proteomic profile alone sufficient optimize therapy . Rather , expect iterative process combine information glean platform , modify avoid toxicity base pharmacogenomics .</brief_summary>
