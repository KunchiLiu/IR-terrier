	<brief_summary>The management patient unruptured aneurysms controversial . Patients unruptured aneurysm may suffer intracranial hemorrhage , incidence event still debate . Endovascular treatment prevent rupture , involve immediate risk ; furthermore , successful treatment eliminate risk . A randomized trial may best way demonstrate potential benefit endovascular conservative management unruptured aneurysm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design pragmatic trial . All candidate endovascular treatment one unruptured intracranial aneurysm offer participate . Unruptured aneurysm may recently discover prevalent . If accept , subject randomize one two arm trial : Conservative management ( Observation ) Endovascular treatment . Both group advise obtain medical treatment hypertension necessary receive counsel behavioural risk factor model ( smoke excessive drinking ) indicate . A non-invasive ( MRA CTA ) catheter angiogram baseline CT-scan MRI brain require enter study . These study demonstrate unequivocal presence saccular aneurysm &gt; =3 mm treatable endovascular method . A catheter angiogram require doubt . Imaging study review centrally . Both treatment standardize . Patients follow similarly minimum 10 year .</detailed_description>
