	<brief_title>Pre- Post-operative FOLFOX Based Therapy Patients With Colorectal Cancer With Liver Involvement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although early stage , localize colon rectal cancer associate 5 year survival rate nearly 90 % , minority patient present localized disease . Unfortunately , time initial presentation , approximately 35 % patient colon rectal cancer metastatic disease . Nearly two third patient stage IV disease evidence extrahepatic spread median overall survival rate 8-10 month absence treatment . Even intensive chemotherapeutic regimen , median overall survival patient range 12 month 20 month . However , small subset patient stage IV disease isolate hepatic metastatic disease undergo resection . The patient completely resect liver metastasis enjoy significantly high overall five-year survival , high 58 % carefully select patient . Ten-year overall survival report 22 % patient . Despite improvement , five-year disease-free survival patient best 35 % , hepatic recurrence occur 46 % . The fact adjuvant chemotherapy improve three-year survival rate stage II disease five-year survival rate stage III disease imply treat micrometastatic disease fraction patient . Because micrometastatic disease likely cause high recurrence rate patient undergo liver resection , clear biologic rationale use postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy liver resection . Although strategy common practice many center , convince data improves survival report . A large randomized phase III trial ( EORTC 40983 ) examine question currently ongoing effect survival yet report . Given systemic chemotherapy liver resection remain unproven benefit present time , many wonder preoperative treatment might promise improve recurrence rate .</detailed_description>
