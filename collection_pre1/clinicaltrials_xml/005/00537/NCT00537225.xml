	<brief_summary>Patients peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) experience significant functional limitation due ischemic symptom ( claudication ) high risk CVD morbidity mortality result untreated cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor aggressive atherosclerosis . The overall Goal randomize controlled clinical trial examine synergistic effect multifactor risk reduction walk distance , blood flow quality life 300 patient PAD . Specifically , compare effect 24 month novel , yet well-tested multiple risk factor reduction program , Health Education Risk Reduction Training ( HEAR2T ) Program PAD versus enhance standard care : 1 ) symptom limit walk distance assess treadmill exercise test walk impairment questionnaire ; 2 ) endothelial function measure flow mediate vasodilation ( FMVD ) via brachial artery ultrasound . We also explore association FMVD decrease oxidative stress ( measure oxygen radical absorbance capacity urinary isoprostanes ) reduce degradation nitric oxide ( NO ) and/or increase NO biosynthesis ( measure urine nitrogen oxide , plasma nitrogen oxide , plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine , plasma , urine platelet cyclic GMP ) . Secondary hypothesis examine association reduce CVD risk factor , improve endothelial function , increase walk distance , improve quality life number metabolic syndrome abnormality PAD patient . Significance . This study contribute evidence efficacy multiple risk factor reduction improve physical function quality life understudy , elderly PAD patient . This study also provide preliminary evidence biological basis efficacy multifactor risk reduction restore vascular homeostasis , critical role antiatherogenesis maintain vasoreactivity , necessary slow progression atherosclerosis .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects eligible study include : 1 . Age 50 year old one CVD risk factor 2 . PAD secondary atherosclerosis significant claudication 3 . Claudication define pain , ache , cramp , numbness severe fatigue muscle one low extremity , reproducibly provoke walk cause patient slow stop walk pace 4 . Anklebrachial index ( ABI ) &lt; 0.90 5 . In diabetic ABI inaccurate , case , substitute toe pressure &lt; 60 mmHg 6 . ABI one minute exercise least 20 % low index leg rest ABI 7 . Capable walk least 50 foot 8 . Primary limitation walk claudication , coexist condition severe CAD , uncontrolled hypertension , pulmonary disease , severe arthritis , orthopedic condition 9 . Difference walking time two consecutive ( four ) baseline treadmill test must &lt; 25 % . Exclusion criterion include : 1 . Active malignancy tumor condition would severely limit life expectancy 2 . Any type major surgery last 3 month ( i.e . aortic low extremity arterial surgery , angioplasty , lumbar sympathectomy , leg amputation ankle ) 3 . Residence longterm institutional set 4 . Psychiatric disorder currently active manifestation 5 . Uncontrolled metabolic disorder ( renal failure , liver failure , thyrotoxicosis ) 6 . Active symptom suggestive acute coronary syndrome decompensated heart failure 7 . Lack phone access ( either self neighbors/family member ) 8 . Other specified circumstance incompatible casemanagement ( i.e. , plan move away area ) 9 . Presence another household member firstdegree relative already enrol study 10 . Current enrollment another clinical trial 11 . Regular participation exercise program least 3 month prior study entry .</criteria>
