	<brief_summary>1 ) Research question : 1a . Can non-sonographer health care professional community medical office practice set trained detect evaluate subclinical atherosclerosis ? 1b . Can carotid ultrasound perform community office practice improve physician use evidence-based , risk-reducing intervention patient motivation adhere therapeutic recommendation ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Using Hand Held Carotid Ultrasonography Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Health care provider five medical practice complete 2-day training program teach instrumentation , scan , measurement , quality assurance , interpretation . They also learn CV risk assessment , intervention , use ultrasound-based CV risk stratification treatment algorithm . After certification , site recruit 70 patient practice ( total N=350 ) . Subjects complete routine office visit pre-test survey design assess motivation intention change . The physician 's initial plan action base usual care record . Next , subject standardize CV risk carotid ultrasound . The physician revise his/her treatment plan base scan result ultrasound-based risk assessment algorithm include CV risk factor ultrasound data . Evidence-based treatment recommendation lifestyle change risk factor target provide . The physician 's scan-based plan action record . The subject inform result repeat survey . All image , interpretation , recommendation review UW AIRP .</detailed_description>
