	<brief_summary>Transforming growth factor-beta 1 ( TGF-β1 ) consistently express fibrotic disease display variety profibrotic effect fibroblast . Activation TGF-β receptor induces activation several kinase signal cascade lead phosphorylation SMAD proteins well activation SMAD-independent kinase collectively activate ECM synthesis fibroblast growth differentiation myofibroblasts . TGF-β1 one main mediator fibrotic process , associate scar long list pathology relate chronic inflammation affect type organ tissue . An increase TGF-β1 mRNA protein level describe process . Peptide 144 ( P144 ) acetic salt 14mer peptide human TGF-β1 type III receptor ( betaglycan ) . P144 TGF-β1-inhibitor specifically design block interaction TGF-β1 TGF-β1 type III receptor , thus block biological effect . P144 show significant antifibrotic activity mouse receive repeat subcutaneous injection bleomycin , widely accept animal model human scleroderma , could contribute development . The purpose study asses efficacy safety topical application P144 treatment skin fibrosis patient systemic sclerosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Systemic sclerosis scleroderma multisystemic disorder characterize excessive synthesis deposition extracellular matrix protein result fibrosis skin visceral organ ( include gastrointestinal tract , lung , heart kidney ) . The pathogenesis scleroderma complex still poorly understood , major pathway involve development condition microvascular immunological abnormality , well dysregulation fibroblast activity . One key molecule involve pathogenesis skin fibrosis TGF-β1 ; TGF-β1 cytokine directly responsible fibroblast proliferation collagen extracellular matrix overproduction . The affected skin patient systemic sclerosis gradually become firm , thicken eventually tightly bound underlie subcutaneous tissue ( indurative phase ) . It lose hair , oil , sweat gland become dry coarse . Changes begin distally extremity advance proximally . Lesions develop period time varying month year . In patient limited scleroderma , skin finger , hand , face low arm legs affected . On contrary , patient diffuse cutaneous disease , skin change become generalized , involve initially extremity follow face trunk . Rapid progression change 2 3 year period usually associate great risk visceral disease . After several year disease , skin may soften return normal thickness become thin atrophic . There currently approve specific treatment skin fibrosis systemic sclerosis neither European Union United States America . P144 belong peptide family able inhibit TGF-β1 vitro vivo model characterize excessive TGF-β1 function . Topical application P144 exert preventive effect preclude induction skin fibrosis accumulation collagen animal also show therapeutic property reduce skin fibrosis soluble collagen content mouse establish fibrosis . The EMEA FDA grant P144 orphan drug status treatment systemic sclerosis . In study , percentage reduction soluble collagen content skin hardness ( durometer ) measure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients male female &gt; 18 &lt; 65 year time consent . History Systemic sclerosis ( include diffuse scleroderma limit scleroderma ) less three year evolution onset cutaneous manifestation . Symmetric lesion forearm . The extension select symmetric lesion must least 15 cm2 . Stable therapy least one month , except case patient treatment putative disease modify agent ( immunosuppressant like cyclophosphamide , azathioprine ) need least three month stable therapy , without expectation treatment modification trial period . Capable understanding willing provide sign dated write voluntary informed consent protocol specific procedure perform . For female subject childbearing potential : use know highly effective method birth control , define result low failure rate : i.e . le 1 % per year , ( contraceptive pill , intrauterine contraceptive device , implant , vasectomized partner sexual abstinence ) , least three consecutive month prior study , study one month end study . For male subject partner child bear potential : use appropriate contraceptive method ( vasectomy , condom sexual abstinence ) , least study period one month end study . Patients diagnose : Systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma . Localized scleroderma . Eosinophilic fascitis , eosinophilia myalgia syndrome . Any definable connective tissue disease , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , polymyositis , dermatomyositis . Clinically significant overlap condition . Significant exist internal organ damage ( Kidney , Cardiovascular disease , Pulmonary disease , Gastrointestinal disease ) define `` Guidelines clinical trial systemic sclerosis ( scleroderma ) `` See appendix 1 . History skin cancer . Other skin disease affect treatment area . Patients substantial history environmental exposure taint rapeseed oil , vinyl chloride , L tryptophan , bleomycin , trichloroethylene , silica . PUVA therapy within 1 month study drug initiation . Concurrent interventional therapy might independently influence outcome trial , Dpenicillamine , cyclosporine , methotrexate , interferonα photopheresis . Topical corticosteroid treatment affect select area . Cosmetics treatment area . Pregnant breastfeed woman . Reasonable expectation subject able satisfactorily complete study : History current psychiatric illness would interfere subject 's ability comply protocol requirement give informed consent . History alcohol drug abuse would interfere subject 's ability comply protocol requirement . Receipt investigational drug within three month screen visit . Documented noncompliance .</criteria>
