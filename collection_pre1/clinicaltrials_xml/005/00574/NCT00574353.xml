	<brief_summary>When use different radioactive tracer call FMISO , PET scan find area low oxygen tumor . We think area low oxygen reason tumor hard treat radiation . In past study , FMISO PET scan perform 6 patient rectal cancer could operate spread area . In group patient , FMISO PET scan able find low oxygen area tumor . But study include patient . In present study , want use FMISO PET scan patient tumor operate . This group patient radiation , chemotherapy surgery . We want see FMISO PET find low oxygen area distinct group patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Using Fluorine-18-Labeled Fluoro-Misonidazole Positron Emission Tomography Detect Hypoxia Locally Advanced ( T3-T4 and./or N1 ) Primary Rectal Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoxia characteristic feature malignant solid tumor associate poor prognosis resistance chemotherapy radiation . It also show ( 6 ) presence hypoxia may reduce long-term survival post surgery . Hypoxia render tumor cell three time resistant ionize radiation aerobic cell . The presence hypoxic region within tumor may one factor lead local failure treatment standard pre-operative radiotherapy dos . If region could identify verified use non-invasive imaging technique prior surgery , could specifically target use sophisticated planning technique intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) deliver high dos ionize radiation preoperative radiotherapy . Future study use IMRT `` dose paint '' area hypoxia within tumor build upon result feasibility study . Ultimately , delivery differential dose radiation tumor , combination surgery , local control rate rectal cancer patient may improve .</detailed_description>
