	<brief_summary>The purpose study image skin skin lesion new image technology call `` multiwavelength coherence confocal reflectance microscopy '' . This technology use low intensity laser image surface skin . This technology may provide new way look skin skin lesion . The goal study evaluate image skin take microscope . The technique evaluate study use multi wavelength coherence confocal reflectance microscopy invivo . The term `` vivo '' mean in/on living subject . In study living subject multi wave length coherence confocal microscope place skin look skin lesion normal skin . The confocal microscope use weak laser light sophisticated lens image individual cell make skin . Your lesion photograph high resolution photography . An area near skin lesion clinically normal also image manner .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-Wavelength Coherence Confocal Reflectance Microscopy Pigmented Non-Pigmented Lesions Skin In-Vivo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients image Vivascope 1500m multiwavelength coherence microscope single patient visit . The lesion photograph high resolution photography surface epiluminescence microscopy . The clinically uninvolved site image manner . The lesion prepped RCM image . A skin contact device consist metal ring template apply skin surround lesion interest disposable medicalgrade adhesive plastic disc . A wetting solution place metal ring . The wetting solution include water , mineral oil counter product ( e.g . hairstyling gel moisturize agent ) . Application agent diminish artifact cause light scatter skin surface . RCM image lesion capture contact device use Vivascope 1500m surface confocal microscope provide Lucid Technologies , Inc. Two type image collect , VivaBlocks VivaStacks . VivaBlocks 4x4 mosaic confocal image measure 2mm x 2mm total area . These VivaBlock image optically combine `` stitch '' together VivaScope 1500m create seamless representation 4 mm 2 area specific depth within skin . VivaStacks eight 0.5mm x 0.5mm confocal image take 3 micron interval keratin layer superficial dermis . VivaStacks VivaBlocks acquire skin lesion clinically uninvolved area skin . The total estimated imaging time patient study 30 minute lesion clinically uninvolved site . The confocal imaging session dermatologic visit punch biopsy occur patient visit . All lesion image save network server later review analysis . All image complete trained research staff familiar confocal imaging .</detailed_description>
