	<brief_summary>The investigator wish study magnetic field map use magnetocardiography ( MCG ) subject undergoing computed tomographic angiography ( visualization heart artery use CT scanning , CTA ) . The main purpose investigate MCG capable detect presence obstructive coronary artery disease ( CAD ) detect CT angiography ( CTA ) well MCG exclude presence CAD define CTA . Secondarily investigator look correlation MCG non-obstructive CAD correlation MCG test ( treadmill testing , stress echo nuclear scan , coronary angiography ) do part work CAD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiomagnetism refers detection , analysis interpretation magnetic field generate electrical activity heart . The peak value magnetic field heart million time small Earth 's magnetic field . A major breakthrough capability measure small field come invention SQUID ( superconducting quantum interference device ) late sixty . The first magnetocardiograms ( MCGs ) measure SQUID record Cohen et al . 1970 . These early measurement perform expensive magnetically shield room , initially utilize one two SQUID probe . In eighty technology test several laboratory create magnetic field map move one SQUID sequentially chest create image whole heart magnetic field . These map attempt correlated various pathology ( 1 ) . Since technology greatly improve several multi-channel machine use across world research purpose arrhythmia localization ischemia detection . However , present time , one company ( CardioMag Imaging , Schenectady , New York ) develop machine operates outside shielded room . The CardiomagImaging ( CMI ) Magnetocardiograph ( MCG ) capable noninvasive record magnetic field arise electrical activity heart high spatial temporal resolution . The temporal trace MCG analogous ECG , , similarly , record multiple lead . This MCG device specifically develop general purpose ( outside shield room ) non-contact , non-invasive diagnostics ischemia . The CMI MCG device approve FDA safe tool measure record magnetic field arise heart 's electrical current . It await FDA approval specific diagnosis ischemia chest pain patient ( 2,3 ) . We use CMI 9-channel MCG detection ischemia patient admit Cedars-Sinai Medical Center acute chest pain syndrome . The result excite publish abstract one manuscript , another manuscript submission ( 4,5 ) . In summary , study 75 patient acute chest pain 65 healthy volunteer find strong association abnormal MCG scan ischemia ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) . The sensitivity , specificity , PPV NPV 87.1 % , 85.7 % , 64.3 % , 95.7 % , respectively . In comparison , diagnostic value stress SPECT image 91.3 % , 75.0 % , 75.0 % , 91.3 % , sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value , respectively . These result achieve without use stress provocation , contrast administration , ionize radiation , result available immediately . Since start chest pain protocol another diagnostic imaging technology become widespread used , 64-slice CT angiography . This technology utilize fast CT scanner involve administration contrast agent , avoids invasiveness heart catheterization . The accuracy detection CAD exclusion high compare angiography ( 6 ) . Although minimally invasive , CT angiogram involve radiation dose similar use stress nuclear testing , approximately 900 1100 mrem ( 6 ) iodine contrast use may cause contrast nephropathy , especially diabetic already impaired renal function . The use technology provide opportunity find subject normal coronary artery accuracy close high invasive coronary angiography . To date , population hard study , since subject normal stress test rarely undergo invasive study . Therefore , wish conduct correlative study CT angiography entirely noninvasive risk free MCG see future may able avoid risk associate CTA . We think may find subject clearly abnormal MCG may need CTA , could proceed directly angiography possible angioplasty .</detailed_description>
