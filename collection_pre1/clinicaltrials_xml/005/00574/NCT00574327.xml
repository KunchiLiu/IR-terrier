	<detailed_description>Symptoms gastroesophageal reflux common . It affect least 40 % adult American population 40 million American adult experience reflux symptom regular basis . Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) typically affect Caucasians old male . It significant risk factor development Barrett 's esophagus ( BE ) esophageal adenocarcinoma . Approximately 10-15 % patient chronic GERD diagnose BE , premalignant lesion esophageal adenocarcinoma . Adenocarcinoma esophagus continue rapidly increase incidence cancer United States . Based study evaluate screening/surveillance strategy , clear imperative identify risk factor would target patient gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) BE may benefit screen surveillance strategy , yet also practical cost-effective . A good understanding event surround development BE patient chronic GERD , development dysplastic change patient BE progression BE adenocarcinoma may ultimately help identify patient increase risk . Thus , hypothesis systematic collection data natural history GERD BE patient risk factor development BE patient chronic GERD progression BE dysplasia adenocarcinoma provide useful information develop decision model risk stratification risk reduction strategy patient . This model useful tool lead reduction overall health care cost . The study conduct Kansas City Department Veterans Affairs Medical Center . This prospective cohort study design analyze epidemiologic genetic factor relevant development BE patient GERD subsequent progression dysplasia adenocarcinoma . 1 ) The consenting patient well control ( 2:1 ratio ) ask fill validate questionnaire severity GERD food frequency . Data regard medication , family history social history also collect . 2 ) The endoscopy pathology report browse length Barrett 's esophagus confirm histology , length hiatal hernia presence helicobacter pylorus . 3 ) Serum sample participate patient collect frozen measurement insulin , glucose , lipid panel , CRP adiponectin level . Biopsies obtain esophagus endoscopy blood sample would freeze future biomarker cDNA microarray study histochemistry . Approximately10-20 % adult population GERD 0.5 2 % adult population ( 1-4 million individual ) estimate BE know precursor esophageal adenocarcinoma . However , yet able reliably identify individual GERD risk develop BE BE high risk progress esophageal adenocarcinoma . The identification risk factor ultimate goal study enable u good identify high-risk patient provide early intervention therapeutic strategy cost-effective manner .</detailed_description>
