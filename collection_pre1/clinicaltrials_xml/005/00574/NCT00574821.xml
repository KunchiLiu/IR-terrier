	<brief_summary>The purpose research study establish diagnostic use magnetocardiography ( MCG ) patient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) . The use MCG extensively study patient . This pilot study serve characterize abnormality find MCG comparison patient without hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . Additionally , study use understand whether MCG additional diagnostic utility offering clinician insight patient 's disease state , thereby aid development treatment plan . This research study design test effectiveness investigational use magnetocardiography patient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . The device approve U.S Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Magnetic Field Mapping Evaluation Patients With Hypertrophic Heart Disease ( Thick Heart Muscle )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) gene mutation result excessive thicken heart muscle . Due abnormality patient often present voltage change electrocardiograms ( ECG ) suggestive abnormal electrical conduction . The use magnetocardiography ( MCG ) patient yet extensively study . Magnetocardiography ( MCG ) safe , non-invasive , FDA approve technology use detect weak magnetic field generate heart . The goal pilot study determine common MCG finding patient HCM , establish role MCG evaluation treatment patient . We enroll total twenty patient identify hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cardiologist facility . As patient ' enroll study , data collect prospectively . We continue follow patient course 1 year date initial enrollment . Once patient identify candidate study , instruct risk benefit undergo participation . Informed consent participate study obtain patient . We obtain basic demographic information patient include sex , age , race , weight , height , co-morbidities cardiovascular risk factor include , limited family history syncope , sudden cardiac death , chest pain , shortness breath . Information regard symptom experience , onset symptom , previous current diagnostic workup include blood work cardiac scan , current/past treatment also record . A list medication record . Prior MCG scan , patient instruct wear non-metallic contain clothing . Patients 's request lie still table duration 6 minute , undergo magnetocardiography scan . In addition MCG , patient 's blood pressure 12-lead electrocardiogram obtain . Most patient also complete 2D echocardiogram require patient lie table ultrasound probe place left side chest result image heart computer screen . In addition , clinically indicated patient may blood draw take discretion cardiologist . These blood draw may use obtain lipid level , cardiac biomarkers , natriuretic peptide assay ( use evaluate heart failure ) . Once patient complete initial assessment scan , ask patient return follow visit 3 month 1 year repeat MCG . A 2D ECHO obtain 3 month clinically indicate , 1 year . In addition , ask follow scan patient present cardiac symptom chest pain , shortness breath , faint Follow phone interview occur 6 month . We ask information regarding symptom , treatment , hospital admission , cardiologist visit , subsequent diagnostic testing perform include ECGs , transthoracic echo , transesophageal echo , exercise/chemical stress testing , angiogram , cardiac catheterization .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Any patient hemodynamically stable identify hypertrophic cardiomyopathy base prior symptom , 2D ECHO finding , genetic testing , and/or ECG voltage criterion . 2 . Patients sign informed consent understand risk benefit participation . Individual age 1617 consent approval parent /or legal guardian . 1 . Patients prior history myocardial infarction , CAD demonstrate stress test angiogram , and/or CABG exclude study . 2 . Any patient undergone invasive treatment time enrollment include procedure myomectomy and/or septal ablation . However , already enrol subject procedure postenrollment study eligible future scan . 3 . Patients encounter significant symptom , chest pain , hemodynamically unstable . 4 . Any patient ICD pacemaker . 5 . Patients underage consent parent and/or legal guardian .</criteria>
