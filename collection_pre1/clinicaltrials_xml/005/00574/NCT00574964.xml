	<brief_title>Gliadel Wafers Temodar Treatment Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects receive surgery + Gliadel® wafer implantation + Limited Field Radiation Therapy dose 61.2 Gy concomitant daily temozolomide . Up 8 wafer implanted tumor resection cavity ( depend upon size ) maximal tumor resection . Between day 10 30 subject begin standard course post-operative limited field radiation therapy tumor site surround margin , concomitant daily temozolomide ( 75mg/m2 x 7 d/wk 6 week , concomitant chemoradiotherapy phase ) . Beginning later 45 day follow completion radiation , temozolomide give dosage 200 mg/m2 daily five day 28 day schedule , total 6 cycle ( adjuvant chemotherapy phase ) . Subjects monitor weekly chemoradiotherapy CBC differential brief clinical assessment , monthly adjuvant chemotherapy phase . Toxicity report assess every three month . Dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) define section 4.2 . If toxic event unresponsive plan dose modification exceed 20 % enrolled subject stop rule meet study discontinue . MRIs obtain 72 hour post-op , prior first , third , fifth cycle monthly temozolomide . Additionally , stealth MRI CT scan ( without contrast ) do one week prior radiotherapy treatment plan discretion treat Radiation Oncologist . Following completion entire course treatment subject monitor clinically well MRI every 3 month survival evidence progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Subjects must find neuroimaging study clinical evaluation consistent diagnosis primary brain tumor order offer enrollment study . Subsequently , order remain study , must histologically cytologically confirm primary tumor brain . Intraoperative confirmation histology ( i.e . frozen section assessment equivalent ) require subject . Gliadel wafer implant without positive intraoperative histopathology consistent primary tumor brain . The final classification evaluability determination make base postoperative histological report show anaplastic astrocytoma Glioblastoma multiforme . No central pathology review require . Newly diagnose supratentorial primary brain lesion visualize enhanced MRI scan ( CT scan contrast subject undergo MRI ) appropriate surgical resection implantation Gliadel . All eligible subject undergo surgical resection . After resection , communication resection cavity ventricular space prevent use Gliadel® subject leave study . MRI CT without contrast within 30 day study entry . New diagnosis primary brain tumor require . No prior therapy , include previous radiotherapy , chemotherapy , operation allow . Age 18 year old , since rationale therapy establish adult , tumor uncommon child , useful information likely emerge inclusion study . Karnofsky Performance Status great equal 60 . Life expectancy least 12 week . Subjects must normal organ marrow function define : WBC great equal 2,000/mm3 Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mm3 Platelets great equal 125,000/mm3 Total bilirubin less equal 2.0 mg/dl AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 X upper limit normal PT / PTT within 1.5 X upper limit normal Creatinine le equal 1.7 mg/dl BUN le equal 40 mg/dl Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL Clinical evaluation cardiac pulmonary function consistent adequate tolerance surgical procedure . Negative pregnancy test ( beta HCG ) female childbearing age surgically sterilize . The effect BCNU ( active ingredient Gliadel wafer ) concomitant Temozolomide develop human fetus unknown . BCNU know cause fetal harm administer pregnant woman pregnancy risk factor D. Temozolomide May cause fetal harm administer pregnant woman . Animal study , dose less used human , result numerous birth defect . Testicular toxicity demonstrate animal study use small dos recommend cancer treatment . Temozolomide also pregnancy risk factor D. Radiation therapy know mutagenic teratogenic . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , partner participate trial , inform treat physician immediately . Known hypersensitivity allergy BCNU ( carmustine ) component Gliadel® wafer polifeprosan polymer . Known hypersensitivity temozolomide . Subjects may receive investigational agent . If surgeon determines placement Gliadel wafer inappropriate , final diagnosis anaplastic astrocytoma glioblastoma , subject leave study analyze . Subjects chemotherapy radiotherapy time diagnosis . A subject consider unresectable preoperatively , opinion neurosurgeon , subject candidate maximal cytoreductive surgery , ( i.e. , cross midline , continuous ventricular space ) . Such subject eligible treatment protocol . Diagnosis prior central nervous system tumor . Diagnosis systemic cancer require treatment within past five year ( except nonmelanotic carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix ) . Open communication resection cavity ventricular system prevent insertion Gliadel tumor cross midline . Posterior fossa brain stem tumor . Concurrent severe medical illness ( e.g. , active infection , acute hepatitis , cardiac arrhythmia , unstable angina , congestive heart failure , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , uncontrolled seizure , pulmonary insufficiency , pulmonary fibrosis , pulmonary embolus , etc ) psychiatric illness , abnormal laboratory value preclude surgical candidacy limit expect survival less 12 week . Pregnant woman exclude study BCNU and/or Temozolomide pregnancy risk D pharmaceutical agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother BCNU and/or Temozolomide , breastfeed discontinue mother treat either agent . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Subjects immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Therefore , HIVpositive subject receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction BCNU agent administer study . Appropriate study undertaken subject receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
