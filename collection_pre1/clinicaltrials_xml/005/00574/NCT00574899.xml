	<brief_summary>Radical Prostatectomy ( removal prostate ) radiation therapy provide excellent outcome patient localize ( confine one area ) disease , yet still effective treatment disease spread beyond prostate gland . Typically , serum PSA test do diagnose prostate cancer . Following diagnosis , prostate biopsy test help classify patient 's disease accord likelihood recurrence . However , assessment imperfect . There need identify evaluate prostate biomarkers provide exact information regard likelihood recurrence ( prediction ) prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prostate Biomarker Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Inter-SPORE Prostate Biomarkers Study ( IPBS ) establish prospectively collect analyze biological specimen predict validate outcome treatment prostate cancer . The study population consist patient schedule receive standard care therapy localize prostate cancer , either radical prostatectomy ( RP ) radiation therapy ( XRT ; include external beam radiation , brachytherapy , ) . Seven hundred ( 700 ) patient ( 350 RP , 350 XRT ) recruit 11 SPORE site two-year interval . We collect serum , plasma , lymphocytes , prostate tissue sample distribution collaborate biomarker validation sit prostate SPOREs , along clinical epidemiologic data .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Males , 35 year age old , histologically confirm prostate adenocarcinoma , clinically localized prostate gland . Biopsy perform SPORE institution . No prior therapy prostate cancer ( patient receive neoadjuvant therapy collection blood biopsy sample eligible ) . The patient 2 core involve carcinoma . The minimum amount tumor submit 5 mm , least 40 % core involved tumor . ( This amount make 2 positive core 1 core insufficient ) . Patients clinical stage T1T2a NXM0 prostate cancer elect treat RP XRT ( include external beam radiation , brachytherapy , ) SPORE institution . Patients nomogram predict 5year probability freedom biochemical recurrence ( Kattan 1998 ) less equal 85 % ( patient intermediate risk recurrence ) . Ability willingness sign inform consent Participation therapeutic clinical trial experimental agent . Previous cancer kind except nonmelanoma skin cancer Previous surgical minimally invasive treatment enlarge prostate ( e.g . TURP , TUNA , TUIP , laser , microwave ) Use antiandrogen drug 6 month prior diagnosis Use 5alphareductase inhibitor 6 month prior diagnosis</criteria>
