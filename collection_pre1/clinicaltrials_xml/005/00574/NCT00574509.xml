	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety 131I-anti-B1 Radioimmunotherapy combine high-dose BEAM BEAC chemotherapy hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . The study also compare difference response rate time treatment failure historical control patient receive high-dose BEAM BEAC chemotherapy autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient receive radioimmunotherapy high-dose BEAM BEAC chemotherapy autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant . Patients receive escalate dos radioimmunotherapy anti-B1 radiolabeled 131Iodine , high-dose carmustine , etoposide , cytarabine Melphalan ( BEAM ) chemotherapy , autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BEAM+131I-Anti-B1 &amp; Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recurrent Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty patient enrol study . There two administration 131I-anti-B1 give patient , `` dosimetric dose '' `` radioimmunotherapy dose '' . The dosimetric dose consist infusion unlabeled Anti-B1 ( 450 mg ) immediately follow infusion Anti-B1 ( 35 mg ) trace label 5mCi 131I-anti-B1 . The total whole body dosimetry dose calculate approximated one-week time interval radioactive clearance data obtain Whole Body anterior posterior gamma camera scan . Based upon dosimetric data calculation specific individual patient , radioimmunotherapy dose give consist infusion unlabeled Anti-B1 ( 450 mg ) immediately follow infusion 35 mg Anti-B1 include patient specific dose 131Iodine-Anti-B1 . Calculations make dose escation study , whole body radiation dose 30 , 45 , 60 , 75cGy result administration therapeutic activity 131I-anti-B1 . The amount unlabeled Anti-B1 administer calculate body surface area basis , give provide excess Anti-B1 independent tumor burden , splenic uptake , cause .</detailed_description>
