	<brief_title>Safety Study Modified Vaccinia Virus Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label , single dose , dose-escalation trial subject melanoma , breast cancer , head neck squamous cell cancer , liver , colorectal pancreatic adenocarinoma . The intratumoral subject stratify 2 group . Group A include vaccinate vaccinia virus . A history vaccination scar vaccination site require . Group B subject include vaccinate . It expect toxicity profile quite different vaccinate previously vaccinia virus therefore subject stratify separately Phase I trial . All subject refractory tumor receive treatment one five dose level single dose sequential dose-escalating design . Eligible subject receive 1 treatment vvDD-CDSR . A dose divide 1-3 lesion . The sum total maximal diameter lesion ( ) inject must &lt; 10cm . Once MTD and/or MFD define vaccinated I.T . arm described , additional subject may enrol one dose level lower MTD/MFD I.V . infusion phase may begin . Patients enrol IV infusion arm receive single administration vvDD-CDSR one three dose level sequential dose-escalating design .</detailed_description>
