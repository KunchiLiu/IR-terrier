PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well AMG 706 work treat patient persistent recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AMG 706 Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess activity AMG 706 , term frequency patient progression-free survival least 6 month initiate therapy objective tumor response , patient persistent recurrent ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma . Secondary - To determine frequency severity adverse event assess CTCAE v3.0 . - To characterize distribution progression-free overall survival patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral AMG 706 daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
