	<brief_title>Treatment Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma With Quinacrine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 31,000 new case renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) occur year United States , death rate 11,600 annually . Many patient present advance unresectable disease , 30 % patient treated nephrectomy relapse . The 5 year survival rate metastatic renal RCC estimate &lt; 10 % . Surgical resection discernible disease potentially curative treatment . No significant improvement survival demonstrate patient metastatic RCC treat systemic hormonal , chemotherapeutic , radiation therapy . Interferon alpha 15 % objective response rate appropriately select patient . Administration interleukin 2 ( IL 2 ) show similar response rate ; however , approximately 5 % highly select patient durable complete remission . Recent study demonstrate RCC cell harbor abnormality von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) gene , play key role stimulation angiogenesis vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) highly vascularized tumor . The novel agent sunitinib ( Sutent ) sorafenib ( Nexavar ) approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment advance RCC , bevacizumab ( Avastin ) temsirolimus show significant activity treatment-naïve patient . Prolonged progression-free survival report sorafenib sunitinib randomize , control phase 2 3 study , improve survival report temsirolimus poor-risk patient phase 3 randomize study .</detailed_description>
