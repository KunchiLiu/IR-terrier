	<brief_summary>The aim propose study implement evaluate Outreach Facilitation mean increase uptake evidence-based practice secondary prevention management patient establish CVD cardiovascular risk factor , primary care practice throughout Champlain LHIN . This initiative center use Outreach Facilitation Model , skilled health professional know facilitator ( Practice Change Consultants ) serve expert resource primary care practice three area : ) practice performance assessment , feedback , consensus building towards goal set implementation ; b ) clinical , technical , organizational resource practical advice ; c ) encouragement face move challenge associate implementing system change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improved Delivery Cardiovascular Care Through Outreach Facilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General practice visit provide unique opportunity identify treat individual risk CVD . We plan test implementation system change use nurse facilitation organization primary care practice enhance daily adoption practice staff evidence-based guideline prevention strategy lead well patient care . Specifically , : ) Establish Outreach Facilitation program primary care practice throughout Champlain District improve secondary prevention management cardiovascular disease primary care set . The program assist practice ( Champlain CVD Prevention Network ) implementation evidence-based guideline ( Champlain Primary Care CVD Prevention Guidelines ) target follow risk factor : - Hypertension - Dyslipidemia - Diabetes - Chronic Kidney Disease - Smoking - Obesity - Physical Inactivity ii ) Rigorously evaluate program 's efficacy cost effectiveness Hypotheses Implementation outreach facilitation program CVD prevention management improve : ) process cardiovascular health relate care delivery primary care practitioner Champlain LHIN , ii ) clinical outcome patient establish CVD high cardiovascular risk . The improvement evident comparison pre- post-implementation performance within participate practice , practice comparison performance randomize begin program earlier randomize begin later . Design We use `` step wedge '' design outreach facilitation program rolled-out sequentially trial participant , geographic region choose random order , number equally spaced time interval 5 year program implementation period . To allow sequential roll-out program , Champlain LHIN divide 9 small geographic region , refer `` division '' , use GIS map technology . The order division begin program randomize , stratified west/central/and east location within LHIN , division per stratum probability begin program specific time . There 4 data collection point throughout 5-year implementation period . In analysis , data point program implementation ( baseline section wedge ) compare data point program begin ( implementation section wedge ) within division . The multiple baseline data obtain division randomized begin program later others allow underlie temporal change consider variable data analysis order determine , example , whether secular change impact effectiveness program . Impact Evaluation To measure population-level impact program collaborate Institute Clinical Evaluative Sciences ( ICES ) . Specifically , evaluate regional impact program cardiovascular health link participate doctor provincial administrative database ICES determine rate CVD-related hospitalization emergency department visit , mortality morbidity , drug prescription pattern hypertension , lipid control , vascular protective agent . In addition , measure success program level primary care practice qualitative assessment follow aspect program implementation : - impact intervention physician , associated staff patient - resource activity require implement intervention extent implement intend - factor contribute success introduce barrier success Satisfaction program evaluate level physician , practice staff , facilitator .</detailed_description>
