	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer common important health issue . Although effective treatment often available localized disease , metastatic prostate cancer remain incurable . The initial treatment metastatic prostate cancer often include medical surgical treatment deprive tumor male hormone ( androgen ) require growth . Although treatment successful many patient , cancer may eventually return others . Recurrent prostate cancer may treat additional hormonal agent , agent usually result long-term control disease . Eventually patient recurrent prostate cancer progress state cancer grow despite low level circulate male hormone know androgen independent prostate cancer ( AIPC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study &amp; Effectiveness Docetaxel With RAD001 Bevacizumab Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo screening procedure determine eligibility trial . During treatment period , patient give docetaxel/bevacizumab day 1 follow RAD001 continuously day 2-21 call treatment cycle . Patients able continue receive multiple treatment course long cancer get bad person develop problem would prevent stay study . The final part research study completion period include end treatment visit subsequent follow-up visit . These visit take place whenever research medication stop , even stop early . For patient 's safety , he/she least complete end treatment visit .</detailed_description>
