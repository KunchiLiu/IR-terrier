	<detailed_description>This study assess toxicity/safety CHOP chemotherapy give concurrently rituximab , follow maintenance PEG Intron patient anthracycline naïve indolent non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . This study also evaluate response rate , time progression , molecular response , immunologic parameter related treatment . Adult patient indolent , advanced stage , anthracycline naive NHL require treatment may eligible . Patients must measurable disease , severe organ dysfunction , normal ejection fraction old patient . Patients also must adequate hematologic , hepatic renal function , performance status , life expectancy least 18 month . Patients may CNS lymphoma , uncontrolled co-morbid condition , pregnancy , HIV , active psychiatric condition . Additionally , patient may prior hypersensitivity interferon-alpha , cancer within 5 year , significant heart disease myocardial infarction within last 6 month , history thrombosis . Additionally , patient ocular exam prior treatment . Patients study receive 6 cycle combination chemotherapy standard CHOP regimen give conjunction rituximab . Cycles repeat 21-day interval six eight cycle . Patients achieve least partial response chemotherapy begin PEG Intron dose 2g/kg/week subcutaneously . PEG Intron treatment continue 12 month absence sign progressive/recurrent disease , unacceptable toxicity/intolerance therapy . PEG Intron dose adjust base presence symptom clinical manifestation toxicity . Patients undergo bone marrow evaluation molecular test baseline . Those found positive repeat assessment perform post induction therapy , six month PEG Intron . Patients also undergo immunologic evaluation baseline , post induction therapy , six month PEG Intron . At end PEG Intron therapy , patient disease reevaluation annual data collection long-term toxicity , duration response survival .</detailed_description>
