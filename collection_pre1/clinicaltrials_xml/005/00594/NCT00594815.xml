	<detailed_description>The purpose study find immunotherapy ( rituximab ) add chemotherapy safe treatment primary central nervous system lymphoma ( PCNSL ) . PCNSL rare tumor . It usually treat chemotherapy radiation . This combination prolong survival , half patient relapse . We hope addition rituximab improve control tumor . The second goal study ass lower dose brain radiation . Brain radiation may cause memory loss dementia . For patient age 60 , risk significant memory loss 80-90 % . The risk young patient small less clear . In , study patient whose tumor remission chemotherapy treat low dose brain radiation . We hope low dose less toxic . However , also possible use low dose radiation less effective control tumor .</detailed_description>
