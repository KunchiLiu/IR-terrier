	<brief_summary>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) , condition characterize low platelet level possible blood clot , occur small number people treatment drug heparin . Some people HIT may show symptom blood clot time HIT diagnosis , another form HIT , know isolated HIT , people show blood clot symptom even though might blood clot . This study use ultrasound test evaluate presence blood clot time HIT diagnosis follow month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Presence Blood Clots People With Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) ( The HOT Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heparin blood thin medication often prescribed treat prevent blood clot . HIT life-threatening immune disorder occur 1 3 % people receive heparin . In disorder , heparin opposite suppose : promotes new blood clot formation , rather prevent . In people HIT , immune system trigger response heparin , lead destruction platelet low platelet count , know thrombocytopenia . Symptoms usually occur 5 14 day start heparin therapy . Isolated HIT form condition occur people low platelet count , sign blood clot , thrombosis . Several small research study show time isolated HIT diagnosis , 15 50 % people actually asymptomatic thrombosis , mean show sign blood clot , fact one . In month follow HIT diagnosis , 50 % people experience symptomatic thrombosis , mean show sign blood clot . It currently know best treat isolate HIT test unrecognized blood clot . This study use ultrasound image evaluate number people asymptomatic thrombosis time isolate HIT diagnosis determine rate symptomatic asymptomatic thrombosis follow month . The result study assist researcher assess current approach treat isolated HIT design new clinical trial . By explore use non-invasive evaluation technique people HIT , thrombosis research HIT move forward , similar thrombosis research medical condition . This 29-day study enroll hospital patient diagnosis HIT show sign blood clot time HIT diagnosis . On Day 1 , participant undergo blood collection ultrasound . While participant hospital , study researcher review participant ' medical record daily basis collect data current medication , medication compliance , symptom , bleeding , thrombosis complication , laboratory test result . Once participant leave hospital , data collect least week phone call participant and/or treat physician . On Day 29 , participant undergo repeat ultrasound blood collection .</detailed_description>
