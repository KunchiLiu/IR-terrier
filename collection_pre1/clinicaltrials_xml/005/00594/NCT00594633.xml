	<brief_summary>A significant number brain tumor patient receive radiation chemotherapy think problem result treatment . The purpose study find treatment Aricept ( donepezil ) may improve aspect think ability patient brain tumor receive radiation chemotherapy . This research also study whether person particular gene blood-borne substance call apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) likely think problem radiation chemotherapy treatment brain tumor . The finding study help u find whether Aricept improve think ability cancer treatment , whether think difficulty may part relate certain gene .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjunctive Donepezil Therapy Genetic Risk Factors Cognitive Dysfunction Brain Tumor Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A significant proportion brain tumor patient treat radiation chemotherapy disease remission experience cognitive sequela treatment . Cognitive dysfunction sufficient severity interfere ability function premorbid professional social level . There , however , approve pharmacological intervention improve cognitive function cancer patient display treatment-related cognitive deficit . Donepezil , acetylcholinesterase inhibitor , show provide cognitive functional benefit patient Alzheimer 's disease , vascular dementia , patient neurological disease without know cholinergic deficiency . The propose pilot study examine efficacy donepezil improve cognitive function adult brain tumor patient treat radiation and/or chemotherapy mild moderate cognitive difficulty . Neuropsychological measure executive , psychomotor speed , attention , memory ability administer prior , follow donepezil therapy . The propose study also test hypothesis apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) e-4 allele correlate development cognitive impairment radiation chemotherapy treatment . The propose investigation unprecedented may provide preliminary information ( 1 ) pharmacological therapy could improve cognitive function population , ( 2 ) genetic risk factor may increase vulnerability radiation chemotherapy-induced cognitive decline .</detailed_description>
