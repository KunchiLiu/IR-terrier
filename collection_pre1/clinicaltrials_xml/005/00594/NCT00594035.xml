	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Safety Effectiveness Spinal Sealant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurosurgical procedure spine often involve incision dura mater access spinal cord . If dural incision properly repair watertight closure achieve cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) escape present risk significant morbidity . The frequent complication CSF leak recur headache complicate symptom nausea vomit . Furthermore fluid collection skin prevents proper wound heal may lead wound breakdown infection incision . Persistent CSF leak also associate development cerebellar hemorrhage subdural hematoma . Primary repair watertight closure paramount minimize risk sequela associate CSF leak .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients schedule elective spinal procedure require dural incision consider study participation . Patient require procedure involve surgical wound classification Class 1/Clean ( per CDC criterion ) Presence nonwatertight dural closure , either spontaneously upon Valsala maneuver 2025 cm H20 510 second . Active spinal and/or systemic infection Patient require additional spinal surgery within study time period Patient previous spinal surgery involve dural exposure and/or entry level ( ) study procedure Patient preexist external lumbar CSF drain internal CSF shunt Patient participate clinical trial another investigational device drug Patient creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL Patient total bilirubin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL Pregnant breastfeeding female females wish become pregnant length study participation Patient treat chronic steroid therapy ( &gt; 4 week ) unless discontinue 6 week prior surgery Patient document history significant coagulopathy PTT &gt; 35 sec , PT/INR &gt; 1.2 , receive asprin , NSAIDS time surgery Patient receive warfarin heparin time surgery Patient diagnose document compromise immune system and/or autoimmune disease Patient chemotherapy treatment within 6 month prior , plan study Patient prior radiation treatment surgical site plan radiation therapy within 30 day post procedure Patient know malignancy condition prognosis short 6 month Patients document history uncontrolled diabetes Patient require use synthetic nonautologous duraplasty material Patient gap great 2mm remain primary dural closure Patient undergone laminoplasty decompression Patient undergone syringomyelia procedure shunt place subarachnoid position Patient undergone Chiari Malformation procedure entail dural incision C1 level The investigator determine participation study may jeopardize safety welfare patient The investigator determine patient include study reason ( ) already specify</criteria>
