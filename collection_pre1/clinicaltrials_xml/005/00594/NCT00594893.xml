	<brief_summary>The purpose research determine difference two commonly use less invasive technique ( surgical method use small incision cut skin ) use perform total hip arthroplasty ( replacement painful hip new ball socket ) . It unclear technique associate faster recovery low risk complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Mini-Incision Versus 2-Incision Approach Total Hip Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , surgical technique surgical instrument develop limit dissection require perform total hip arthroplasty . Proponents procedure feel associate less perioperative blood loss , less pain accelerate recovery critic raise concern limited exposure may negatively impact component position increase risk perioperative complication . Among less invasive surgical technique , two different approach utilized include `` mini-incision '' posterior approach aim limit amount dissection associate standard posterior approach hip 2-incision technique seek limit soft tissue disruption take advantage intermuscular plane use fluoroscopic guidance . While mini-posterior approach utilizes abbreviate exposure familiar surgeon , 2-incision approach novel approach critic approach feel technically demand nature may associate high risk complication component malposition . Proponents 2-incision approach feel approach less invasive , muscle spar lead substantial improvement patient rehabilitation recovery potential longer-term benefit term improve function . The goal project compare use mini-incision posterior approach 2-incision approach primary total hip arthroplasty via prospective randomize trial .</detailed_description>
