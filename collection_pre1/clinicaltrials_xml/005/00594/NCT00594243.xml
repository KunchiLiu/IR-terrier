Eligibility determine self-report checklist review potential participant phone ( see appendix checklist ) . Pre-intervention study participant consent study measure obtain .

After randomization , participant intervention group receive intervention eight weekly 90-minute mindfulness meditation session . Instead wait 37 participant recruit study intervention , intervention do rolling basis . This mean minimum 6 participant per intervention group , possibility three separate intervention group . If recruitment go well expect , offer intervention 18 participant one time . Controls receive intervention time . Immediately post-intervention measure administer participant wait-list control . Once intervention complete participant wait-list control complete post-intervention measure mindfulness meditation program offer wait-list control . We try combine wait-list control one eight-week program . 3 month intervention complete , participant ask complete measure third time mindfulness meditation continue home quantify . The primary hypothesis : 1 . We expect able recruit 37 eligible individual CLBP study within six-month period . 2 . We expect participant randomized mindfulness meditation intervention meet adherence standard attend 75 % 8 weekly 90-minute session . 3 .
