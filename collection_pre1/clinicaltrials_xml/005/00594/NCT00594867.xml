	<brief_summary>Aspirin medication commonly use relieve minor pain . Aspirin also use prevent heart attack stroke . Aspirin , however , also cause damage stomach and/or intestinal lining lead development erosion ( `` small sore '' ) and/or ulcer ( `` large sore '' ) . Erosions may cause bleeding ( `` bleed ulcer '' ) and/or perforation ( `` hole stomach '' ) . Acetaminophen , often refer brand name , Tylenol , also use treat minor pain commonly recognize cause damage stomach lining . Many patient often take medication together . While effect stomach line medication , use alone , know , effect medication , use together , . The purpose study show whether collective effect aspirin acetaminophen , use together , increase damage stomach lining compare either medication alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Low dose aspirin use primary secondary prevention cardiovascular thromboembolic event . As non-selective inhibitor cyclooxygenase , aspirin use result irreversible COX-1 inhibition lead impaired platelet aggregation . However , aspirin also inhibit COX-1 activity gastric mucosa suppress synthesis protective prostaglandin . In , creates state propensity development aspirin-associated gastrointestinal ulcer ulcer complication . A high proportion aspirin user also require concomitant use anti-inflammatory medication treatment pain arthritis . However , evidence suggests risk develop gastroduodenal ulcer ulcer complication significantly increase aspirin co-administered nonselective NSAIDs . In previous study , concomitant aspirin ( 325 mg daily ) healthy subject take naproxen ( 500mg bid ) associate endoscopic ulcer rate 27.3 % compare aspirin alone ( 7.6 % ) . In separate independent trial similar design , patient use 81 mg aspirin conjunction daily naproxen also result high incidence gastric duodenal ulcer aspirin therapy alone . Beyond endoscopic ulcer rate , risk upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage report substantially increase concurrent administration low-dose aspirin nonselective NSAIDS . These data suggest gastrointestinal toxicity combine aspirin NSAIDs may additive .</detailed_description>
