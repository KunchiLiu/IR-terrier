	<brief_summary>Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) lead muscle atrophy , hyperreflexia spasticity , symptom decrease quality life prevent effective rehabilitation . Previous finding labs find passive cycling exercise program , motorize bicycle exercise training ( MBET ) , adult spinally transect animal reduce muscle atrophy normalize hyperreflexia . We find MBET could prevent onset hyperreflexia spinal transaction , MBET could also use rescue hyperreflexia set , MBET could induce saving normalization reflex MBET cease . We also demonstrate MBET effective rescuing hyperreflexia chronic ASIA B SCI patient , short-term MBET could lead brief saving normalization reflex MBET cease . The proposed study test ability MBET prevent onset hyperreflexia group acute SCI patient train hyperreflexia chance set . In addition , propose research attempt confirm possibility long-term MBET chronic SCI patient rescue hyperreflexia set , also produce significant saving normalization reflex carry long period time . We also test possibility MBET acute and/or chronic SCI patient could reduce prevent muscle atrophy . The experimental design call assess muscle mass use MRI scan , bone density use Dual-Energy X-ray Absortiometry ( DEXA ) scan , spasticity measure electrophysiological measurement determine low frequency habituation H-reflex . Assessments carry MBET , 25 week MBET block time , 12 week post MBET monitoring period . Changes muscle mass , bone density , spasticity scale H-reflex habituation compare across intervention treat SCI victim group control acute chronic SCI victim undergo standard care period .</brief_summary>
