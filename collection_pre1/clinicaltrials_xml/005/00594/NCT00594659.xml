	<brief_summary>More US resident dependent marijuana illicit drug , number enrol treatment marijuana continue increase comparable cocaine heroin . This application seek advance overarch goal develop disseminate cost-effective treatment marijuana dependence address grow problem . The researcher ' previous research suggest intervention comprise motivational enhancement , cognitive-behavioral , contingency-management component ( MET/CBT/CM ) produce great rate successful durable outcome demonstrate previously . However , three issue relevant efficacy eventual dissemination must confront . First , outcomes achieve characterized modest ; many individual respond treatment relapse rate remain problematic . Second , access limited availability train provider . Third , cost delivering treatment high traditional outpatient intervention . To address issue , Specific Aim 1 develop test computer-assisted version MET/CBT/CM . Computerized treatments potential increase overall effectiveness treatment service increase availability access potent treatment , apply innovative technology enhance outcome . During Year 1 , intervention develop pilot test . An interactive program show promise previous trial opioid dependence modify enhance deliver individualize MET/CBT/CM use effective computer learn technology . These technology access MET/CBT/CM program make available via Internet treatment session treatment end potential promote well learning use cop skill , turn improve outcome . During Years 2-4 randomized trial provide initial efficacy test cMET/CBT/CM compare brief treatment ( MET ) therapist-delivered MET/CBT/CM . Specific Aim 2 learn behavioral treatment like MET/CBT/CM work focus two putative mechanism action examine prior trial : self-efficacy/coping skill impulsivity/delay discounting . The experimental design provide unique opportunity explore mechanisms novel context- therapist vs. prominent part treatment . The propose project address objectives NIDA 's Behavioral Integrative Treatment Development Program provide research technology-assisted treatment attempt make treatment delivery less complex , easy access , less costly - retain improve effectiveness . Findings inform future study design refine technology apply ; conduct definitive effectiveness testing ; test generality population include adolescent ; advance translation community setting .</brief_summary>
