	<brief_summary>This study target old adult ( age 60 ) overweight ( body mass index 25-40 ) impair fast glucose ( 100 - 125 ) . We propose three-year , randomize control clinical trial ( n=300 ) determine effect one-year physical activity counsel intervention glucose metabolism secondary outcome compare usual care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>IMPACT . Our propose project contribute improve quality efficiency VA health care : ( 1 ) provide effective program Enhanced Fitness counsel result significant increase physical activity sufficient magnitude achieve note improvement glycemic control , ( 2 ) develop disseminate material use throughout VHA physical activity promotion old , overweight adult . BACKGROUND . The nation experience marked increase obesity , diabetes . Users VA medical facility report high national average rate obesity diabetes . Current projection indicate 70 % veteran use VA medical care overweight , 20 % diabetes , 30- 40 % metabolic syndrome . Approximately 30 % VA health care cost attributable care diabetes alone . Incidence prevalence condition increase age associate high medical cost . This especially true old adult typically add comorbidities functional limitation . The VHA aggressively address exist epidemic implement various program performance measure aim attain optimal medical management dyslipidemia , diabetes , obesity . The component initiative receive least amount attention physical activity despite overwhelming evidence physical activity favorably alter medical condition describe . The VA system-wide ill equip provide feasible , cost effective physical activity program despite imperative seek way reduce incident diabetes reduce potential health care cost . OBJECTIVES . We propose innovative home-based enhanced fitness counsel intervention involve unique partnership veteran , primary care provider , exercise counselor direct old adult . The propose project , Enhanced Fitness , seek improve glycemic control old , overweight adult impair fast glucose receive primary care VA. A novel design , adaptive randomization , allow u assess impact intervention early stage reassign individual intense reduce intervention base upon patient compliance . Due national implementation MOVE ! primary care treatment obesity consider MOVE ! part usual care population . Primary Hypothesis . Compared usual care ( plus MOVE ! ) , individual receive Enhanced Fitness counsel significantly improve glucose metabolism ( fasting insulin ) . Secondary Research Hypotheses Objectives . ( 1 ) Compared usual care ( plus MOVE ! ) , individual receive Enhanced Fitness counsel significantly improve secondary outcome related glycemic control ( fast blood glucose , HOMA-IR , HbA1c , metabolic syndrome score ) , physical function ( self report physical performance ) , disability , health relate quality life ; ( 2 ) To determine difference cost health care utilization group . Note : 7/5/2010 : An amendment submit approve drop adaptive randomization component study . This necessary due low level noncompliance observe first follow-up assessment . The primary secondary objective study affected amendment . Another amendment submit approve : 1 ) evaluate association APOE , diabetic risk physical function ; 2 ) examine association inflammatory marker , diabetic risk , physical function . METHODS : For propose study target old adult ( age 60 ) overweight ( body mass index &gt; 24-40 ) impair fast glucose ( 100 - 125 ) . We propose three-year , randomize control clinical trial ( n=300 ) determine effect 1-year Enhanced Fitness counsel intervention glucose metabolism . A novel design , adaptive randomization , allow u mimic primary care alter treatment base upon patient compliance . We use `` train trainer '' approach dissemination result local , VISN , national level .</detailed_description>
