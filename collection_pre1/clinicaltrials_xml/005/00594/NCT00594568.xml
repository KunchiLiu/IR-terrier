	<brief_summary>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) fatal degenerative disease brain cure . AD cause brain cell die . AD think cause excess beta-amyloid ( β-amyloid ) , sticky protein brain form amyloid plaque . At autopsy , AD patient require amyloid plaque brain order definitive diagnosis AD . Inhibiting enzyme gamma-secretase ( γ-secretase ) lower production β-amyloid . Semagacestat ( LY450139 ) functional γ-secretase inhibitor show low β-amyloid blood spinal fluid human test thus far blood , spinal fluid , brain animal test thus far . This study use several different test measure effect semagacestat β-amyloid amyloid plaque participant . The build-up amyloid plaque measure brain scan take picture amyloid plaque brain . Other test measure overall function brain brain size participant . In trial , participant initially receive placebo ( inactive sugar pill ) , certain point study , switch active drug , semagacestat . In word , participant could eventually receive active drug . Participation could last approximately 2 year . Participants take approve AD medication permit participate study continue take medication study . All participant complete study option continue receive semagacestat participate open-label study . Preliminary result study ( H6L-MC-LFAN [ LFAN ] ) another similar study ( H6L-MC-LFBC [ LFBC ; NCT00762411 ] ) show semagacestat slow disease progression associate worsen clinical measure cognition ability perform activity daily live . Study drug stop study . Studies LFAN , LFBC , open-label H6L-MC-LFBF ( LFBF ; NCT01035138 ) amend continue collect safety data , include cognitive score , least 7 month . The Clinical Trial Registry ( CTR ) reflect result analyse original LFAN protocol addition amend LFAN protocol .</brief_summary>
