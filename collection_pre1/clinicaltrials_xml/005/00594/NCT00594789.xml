	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate post-fracture intervention improve osteoporosis care older men woman suffer fracture may indicate presence osteoporosis . Although osteoporosis identify bone mineral density ( BMD ) test , individual osteoporosis diagnosed fracture . Post-fracture care often `` fall crack '' breakdown communication hospital community , specialist primary care physician . Often physicians patient fail make connection acute fracture osteoporosis , value secondary prevention strategy . If untreated , extremely high rate additional fracture first osteoporotic fracture . It follow improve BMD test and/or treatment appropriately identify individual necessary step optimize post-fracture patient care . Over next three year test optimize notification procedure physician and/or patient rely upon fracture event report provincial health service ( Manitoba Health ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Closing The Post Fracture Care Gap In Manitoba</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A major 'care gap ' exists management patient fracture suggestive osteoporosis . Currently , small minority individual high risk recurrent fracture undergo evaluation possible treatment . We propose test optimize novel approach address question , rely upon fracture event report provincial health service ( Manitoba Health ) mechanism osteoporosis case identification enhance post fracture care . Phase 1 ( one year duration ) : individual meet fracture case definition randomize usual care ( intervention ) , physician notification physician/patient notification . The notification provide general recommendation osteoporosis assessment . The use appropriate post-fracture investigation treatment prospectively evaluate . Phase 2 ( two year duration ) : intervention refine iteratively trialed individual meet fracture case definition . Phase 3 : recommendation long term maintenance post-fracture intervention develop .</detailed_description>
