	<detailed_description>The majority intervention deliver primary care setting low-cost touch-screen computer multi-media audio-narrative video message . Studies test effectiveness tailor communication specify state `` implementation intention '' improve CRC screening . A randomized design test comparison generic information versus multi-media tailor intervention specifically address participant 's screening test preference , current CRC screen decisional state ( Precaution Adoption Process Model ) , specify state `` implementation intention '' ( `` , '' `` Where , '' `` '' detail screen . ) Behavioral intervention material English Spanish develop help cultural expert , pilot test , interview test salience cultural appropriateness audio , video , graphic message low-income minority white . The study conduct 460 patient eligible CRC screening recruit present care urban clinic . All participant receive baseline touch-screen administer assessment , depend state preference , offer either immunochemical fecal occult blood test ( iFOBT-InSureTM ) colonoscopy . Participants randomize either `` C '' ( comparison group-computer deliver generic CRC information ) `` TI2 '' ( active intervention-computer deliver tailor messaging base individual PAPM stage , behavioral construct , `` implementation intention '' ) . A brief office exit survey ass patient-provider discussion CRC screen satisfaction computerized message material . A 90-day post randomization follow-up telephone call assessment participant reassess PAPM stage perceive CRC screen barrier . The primary outcome CRC screen completion 90 day . Secondary outcome assess 90-day PAPM stage perceive barrier among participant prefer various screen method ( iFOBT , Colonoscopy ) . This intervention provide information utility embed low-cost technologically advanced `` implementation intention '' base behavioral intervention primary care practice .</detailed_description>
