	<brief_title>Study Safety Effectiveness Switching Between Two Forms Tapentadol Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study establish dose equivalence safety effectiveness Immediate Release ( IR ) Extended Release ( ER ) form tapentadol ( CG5503 ) support conversion IR ER , ER IR use . Dose equivalence examine patient diagnosed moderate-to-severe , chronic Low Back Pain ( LBP ) require drug treatment least 3 month , dissatisfy current therapy . The study consist 5 period : screening period patient evaluate study eligibility ; 21-day open-label period find best , stable dose tapentadol ( CG5503 ) IR patient individually ; 14-day double-blind period patient randomly choose either continue 14 day stable IR dose open-label period switch ER form ; second , 14-day period patient switch whichever form tapentadol ( CG5503 ) take first 14-day period ( total daily dose [ TDD ] remain approximately equivalent IR ER form throughout double-blind period ) ; follow-up period . During study , pain level record overall safety measure take . The expectation ( think ) approximately equivalent dos form tapentadol ( CG5503 ) provide equivalent effectiveness safety two form directly convert divide total daily dose number time drug take day . During 21-day open-label period , 50 , 75 100mg IR form give orally every 4 6 hour , start 50mg every 6 hour . Then , dose , frequency give drug , may increase , maximum TDD 500mg , decrease 50 mg increment , minimum TDD 200 mg , optimal stable dose patient find . During 2 double-blind period , TDD approximately equivalent stable open-label dose give orally IR ( ER ) form placebo .</detailed_description>
