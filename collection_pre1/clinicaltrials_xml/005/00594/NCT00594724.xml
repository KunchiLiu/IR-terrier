	<brief_summary>The purpose study see brain re-learns control tongue speak swallow either portion tongue remove , tongue treat radiation , order treat cancer . We hope result study help u improve heal patient treated cancer tongue . When patient cancer tongue treat remove part tongue ( surgery ) destroy cancer radiation tongue , significant difficulty speak swallow treatment . At time , patient treat cancer tongue re-learn speaking swallowing exercise teach speech pathologist . What need information brain re-learns control speak swallow help patient re-learn fast treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Therapeutic Outcomes Tongue Carcinoma Patient : Assessment Adaptation Using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Diffusion Tensor Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose investigation determine cortical mechanism adaptation surgical radiation treatment tongue . This study use non-invasive imaging technique , Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) , investigate cortical response partial glossectomy radiation therapy treatment tongue malignancy . Patients Stage I-IV ( AJCC ) malignancies tongue treat surgery radiation therapy image use fMRI pre-operatively approximately six month postoperatively . Patterns brain activity fMRI study compare match healthy control subject . The result investigation provide need information central peripheral mechanism adaptation .</detailed_description>
