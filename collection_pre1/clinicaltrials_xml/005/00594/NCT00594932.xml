	<brief_summary>We hypothesize mycophenolate mofetil ( Cellcept ) safe effective lupus arthritis . In study , patient lupus randomly assign receive mycophenolate mofetil placebo ( inert pill ) three month . At end three month patient receive mycophenolate mofetil three additional month . The effectiveness arthritis symptom lupus measure joint count BILAG instrument ( measure overall lupus disease activity . Additionally special blood test aim understanding biologic effect mycophenolate mofetil also perform visit . The primary outcome measurement safety effectiveness treatment ( compare placebo ) three month point . The trial continue blind fashion ( neither investigator participant know get mycophenolate get placebo ) 24 patient complete first three month protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarker-Linked Outcomes Cellcept Lupus Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Methods : 27 patient active BILAG B A arthritis , least 6 swollen 6 tender joint enter six month study MMF v placebo three month follow open label MMF . 14 patient ( 12 woman 2 men ) receive placebo baseline 13 patient ( 11 woman 2 men ) receive MMF . Primary Outcome Major Clinical Response 3 month , patient receive open label Cellcept another 3 month . Blood drawn safety , lupus disease activity measure exploratory Biomarkers , Joint count perform monthly . At baseline background DMARDs stop . Plaquenil allow . All patient receive 160 mg depomedrol baseline allow 80 mg shot subsequent month blood draw procedure complete . Baseline Characteristics : At entry study , difference MMF placebo : age , gender , ethnicity , number ACR criterion lupus , number swell tender joint . DEFINITION RESPONSE Prespecified Primary Endpoint : Complete Clinical Response : BILAG C musculoskeletal Week 12 decrease 0.25 less tender +swollen jt count Prespecified Secondary Endpoint : Partial response : One letter drop musculoskeletal Week 12 OR decrease 0.5 less tender + swell jt count Exploratory Measure ( prespecified ) : Major Clinical Response : BILAG C musculoskeletal Week 12 decrease 0.5 less tender +swollen jt count . ( In primary analysis one patient meet endpoint designate partial responder since prespecified criterion also meet . Non response : Does meet criterion complete partial response Additional Measures : ( prespecified secondary endpoint ) include joint count , change BILAG SLEDAI physician patient global assessment .</detailed_description>
