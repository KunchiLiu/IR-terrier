	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) systemic inflammatory disease affect 2 million people U.S. alone , condition characterize progressive joint destruction , significant work-related disability accelerate mortality . While precise cause RA unknown , clear disease result single heritable factor single environmental exposure . Of many environmental exposure study , cigarette smoking factor consistently show associated RA onset . In addition role disease susceptibility , recent study find smoking , along genetic factor , contribute RA-related autoimmunity disease severity . Moreover , study date look disease severity RA exclusively involve woman Caucasian/European ancestry . This important distinction since although RA common woman , smoke appear closely link RA risk men . Additionally , burden smoking-related illness appear great among non-Caucasian population . For reason smoking rate prevalence risk-alleles differ ethnic/racial minority ( i.e . SE GSTM1-null polymorphism ) , study need define association smoke possible gene-smoking interaction role autoimmunity disease severity understudied population .</detailed_description>
