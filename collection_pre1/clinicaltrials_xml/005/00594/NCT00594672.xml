	<detailed_description>The Age-Related Eye Disease Study ( AREDS ) Follow-Up protocol allow u continue follow-up participant enrol clinical trial antioxidant vitamins zinc . AREDS study design begin determine clinical course prognosis age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) cataract . In addition , AREDS evaluate possible risk factor associate development AMD cataract ; nutritional risk factor evaluate publish October , 2001 . Study result show antioxidant vitamin zinc therapy reduce risk develop advanced AMD participant intermediate great risk develop AMD ( category 3 4 ) 25 % . The risk vision loss three line logarithmic visual acuity chart also reduce 19 % participant . For developed AMD , risk vision loss reduce 25 % . Antioxidants zinc recommend participant intermediate risk develop advanced AMD . Upon completion AREDS clinical trial September , 2001 , participant invite follow-up additional five year collect data natural course AMD cataracts . Although multi-center trial complete December , 2005 , wish continue follow participant annual basis minimum five year date enrollment study collect additional data . Although result AREDS relationship lutein/zeaxanthin omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( LCPUFA ) intake advanced AMD informative , non-experimental sampling ( observational ) design limited strength inference . AREDS2 , multi-center Phase III randomize clinical trial , design assess effect oral supplementation high dos macular xanthophyll ( lutein zeaxanthin ) and/or omega-3 LCPUFAs treatment AMD , cataract moderate vision loss . In addition objective , study provide information clinical course , prognosis , risk factor development progression AMD cataract . Other study goal include evaluation eliminate beta-carotene and/or reduce zinc original AREDS formulation progression development AMD . AREDS2 also seek validate fundus photographic AMD scale develop AREDS . Upon completion AREDS2 , participant invite follow-up annual basis least five year date enrollment study collect additional data .</detailed_description>
