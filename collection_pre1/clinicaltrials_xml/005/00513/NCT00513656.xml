	<detailed_description>This randomise , double-blind , active-controlled , double-dummy , parallel group study use oxycodone/naloxone oxycodone treat moderate severe , chronic cancer pain . Subjects document history cancer pain require around-the-clock opioid therapy include . Subjects must medical history constipation induce , worsen opioid therapy . After subject qualify study randomise enter double-blind treatment phase study . Subjects randomise receive either oxycodone/naloxone oxycodone . Subjects receive double-blind medication period 4 week . Subjects complete double-blind phase discontinue due constipation still comply relevant screen inclusion exclusion criterion option enter 24 week extension phase .

Subjects receive WHO step II Step III analgesic medication constipation induce , worsen opioid medication , show 1. subject 's medical need regular intake laxative least 3 bowel evacuation per week , le 3 bowel evacuation take laxative , respectively . 2. subject 's selfassessment constipation induce worsened current prestudy opioid medication . 4 . Documented history moderate severe , chronic cancer pain require aroundtheclock opioid therapy ( start dose begin doubleblind phase oxycodone PR 20 80 mg/day ) likely benefit WHO step III opioid therapy duration study . Subjects must willing discontinue current opioid analgesic routine . 5 . Subjects willing discontinue prestudy laxative medication take study specific laxative medication . 6 . Subjects take daily fibre supplementation bulk agent eligible maintain stable dose regimen throughout study , investigator opinion willing able maintain adequate hydration . 7 . Subjects willing able ( e.g . mental physical condition ) participate aspect study , include use medication , completion subjective evaluation , attend schedule clinic visit , complete telephone contact , compliance protocol requirement evidence provide write , informed consent . 8 . Subjects already take nonopioid analgesic concomitant medication ( include treatment depression ) eligible take part study . However , concomitant medication consider necessary subject 's welfare continue stable dose throughout doubleblind phase study supervision investigator . Regarding cyclic chemotherapy please see exclusion criterion list . 1 . Subjects require dose &gt; 80 mg/day oxycodone PR start doubleblind phase . 2 . Any history hypersensitivity oxycodone , naloxone , bisacodyl , related product , ingredient . 3 . Subjects situation opioids contraindicate , severe respiratory depression hypoxia and/or hypercapnia , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , cor pulmonale , severe bronchial asthma , paralytic ileus . 4 . Evidence clinically significant cardiovascular , renal , hepatic psychiatric disease , determine medical history , clinical laboratory test , ECG result , physical examination , would place subject risk upon exposure study medication may confound analysis and/or interpretation study result . 5 . Abnormal aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ; SGOT ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ; SGPT ) , alkaline phosphatase level ( &gt; 3 time upper limit normal ) abnormal total bilirubin and/or creatinine level ( ) ( great 1.5 time upper limit normal ) . 6 . Subjects know suspect unstable brain metastasis spinal cord compression may require change steroid treatment throughout duration study . 7 . Subjects uncontrolled seizure . 8 . Subjects increase intracranial pressure . 9 . In investigator 's opinion , subject receive hypnotic central nervous system ( CNS ) depressant may pose risk additional CNS depression opioid study medication . 10 .

Subjects confirm diagnosis ongoing irritable bowel syndrome . 15 . Subjects suffer diarrhea and/or opioid withdrawal . 16 . Surgery complete prior start Screening Period , plan surgery study would influence pain bowel function study preclude completion study . 17 . Cyclic chemotherapy two week screen visit plan core study show past influence bowel function . If subject first cycle chemotherapy 2 week screen visit doubleblind phase study exclude study . 18 . Radiotherapy , investigator opinion , would influence bowel function pain doubleblind phase study . 19 . Subjects presently take , take , naloxone 30 day prior start Screening Period . 20 . Subjects participate clinical research study involve new chemical entity experimental drug within 30 day study entry ( defined start Screening Period ) .</criteria>
