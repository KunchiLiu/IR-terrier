	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treating Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess clinical efficacy bortezomib base evaluation objective tumor response rate . Secondary - Assess additional clinical efficacy bortezomib base evaluation time early disease progression median overall 2-year survival rate . - Assess safety toxicity patient . - Assess quality life use Lung Cancer Symptom Score . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord current treatment ( first-line v second-line ) Patients receive bortezomib IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 5 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients exhibit objective response stable disease week 20 , may continue treatment discretion investigator evidence disease progression . Quality life assess periodically . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : 57 first-line set 54 second-line setting patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
