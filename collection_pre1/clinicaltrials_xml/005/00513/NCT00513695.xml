	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give sunitinib malate together paclitaxel , doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide surgery work treat patient stage IIB-IIIC breast cancer . Sunitinib malate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving sunitinib malate together combination chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate , Paclitaxel , Doxorubicin Hydrochloride , Cyclophosphamide Before Surgery Treating Patients With Stage IIB-IIIC Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I.To ass microscopic pathologic complete response rate ( pCR ) patient treat two part , neoadjuvant regimen consist daily oral sunitinib weekly IV paclitaxel 12 week follow weekly doxorubicin daily oral cyclophosphamide give filgrastim ( G-CSF ) support 15 week . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess association microscopic pCR clinical complete response rate primary tumor site . II . To assess relapse rate , overall disease-free survival patient breast cancer treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy consist daily oral sunitinib weekly IV paclitaxel 12 week follow weekly doxorubicin daily oral cyclophosphamide give G-CSF support 15 week . III . To assess toxicity associate regimen . IV . To explore relationship plan correlative laboratory clinical study indicator efficacy pathologic response , clinical response relapse . OUTLINE : Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprise sunitinib malate orally ( PO ) daily paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour weekly 8-12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning within 3 week completion sunitinib malate paclitaxel , patient receive doxorubicin IV weekly 15 week , cyclophosphamide PO daily 15 week , filgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) day 2-7 16 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 3-6 week completion chemotherapy , patient undergo surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
