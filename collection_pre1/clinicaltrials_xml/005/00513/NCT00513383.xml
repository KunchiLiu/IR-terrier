	<brief_summary>This study do test whether panitumumab , combination chemotherapy radiation safe people head neck cancer . Another goal study find high dose study drug give safely without cause serious sife effect . Panitumumab type drug call monoclonal antibody study type cancer , kidney colon . This monoclonal antibody direct epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . EGFR find majority head neck cancer cell . By block EGFR , monoclonal antibody may inhibit growth head neck cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- There two part study : Part A Part B . Participants enrol Part A study receive panitumumab chemoradiotherapy . Participants enrol Part B receive panitumumab combination induction chemotherapy follow chemoradiotherapy . - The main purpose Part A examine safety best dose panitumumab , chemotherapy radiation treatment head neck cancer . The best dosing determine increase dos chemotherapy give combination panitumumab radiation . The chemotherapy drug use Part A carboplatin paclitaxel , standard therapy use head neck cancer . These drug add radiation combination call chemoradiotherapy . The investigator determine best dose panitumumab chemotherapy give radiation , Part B begin . - The main purpose Part B examine safety best dose chemotherapy combine panitumumab ( call induction therapy ) prior receive panitumumab chemoradiotherapy . The drug use induction chemotherapy docetaxel , cisplatin 5-fluorouracil . These drug also standard therapy use head neck cancer .</detailed_description>
