	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , irinotecan , fluorouracil leucovorin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving combination chemotherapy together monoclonal antibody therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give combination chemotherapy together monoclonal antibody therapy work treat patient advanced colorectal cancer liver metastases lung metastasis potentially removable surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine pathological complete response ( CR ) rate resect patient assess lesion less equal 30 mm size . Secondary - To determine clinical CR rate patient . - To determine toxicity tolerability regimen ( pre- postoperative toxicity ) . - To evaluate perioperative safety patient . - To determine disease-free survival ( time progression unresected patient ) overall survival whole study population . - To determine resectability patient . - To evaluate marker predict occurrence pathological CR non-response pathological material ( resect liver metastasis ) biological material collect patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 15 , irinotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 8 22 , fluorouracil IV 24 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , leucovorin calcium IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 5 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients able undergo liver resection receive bevacizumab day 1 course 3 undergo liver resection 3 week chemotherapy . Beginning 4 week liver resection , patient receive 2 additional course chemotherapy adjuvant therapy . Patients undergo tumor tissue blood sample collection periodically biological study . Samples analyze marker predict occurrence complete pathological response ( pCR ) non-response . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month first 2 year every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
