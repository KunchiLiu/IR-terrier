	<brief_summary>Background : - Most therapeutic therapy metastatic melanoma focus ability T-cell lymphocytes kill cell tumor . - An adaptive cell transfer therapy pioneer , cell grow short time laboratory . The way grown may better effect patient 's body cell culture long time . Objectives : - To determine whether tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ( TIL ) put cell remove patient ' tumor blood reinfused , purpose shrink tumor . - To evaluate safety effectiveness treatment . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old metastatic cancer melanoma ( cancer spread beyond original site ) . - Patient 's leukocyte antigen type human leukocyte antigen ( HLA-A ) 0201 . Design : -Patients undergo follow procedure : - Leukapheresis ( two occasion ) . This method collect large number white blood cell . The cell obtain first leukapheresis procedure grown laboratory , TIL cell ( call young TIL cell ) insert cell use inactivate ( harmless ) virus process call retroviral transduction . Cells collect second leukapheresis procedure use evaluate effectiveness study treatment . - Chemotherapy . Patients give chemotherapy vein ( intravenously , IV ) 1 hour 2 day suppress immune system patient 's immune cell interfere treatment . - Treatment young TIL cell . Patients receive IV infusion treat cell , follow infusion drug aldesleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , help boost effectiveness treat white cell . - Patients give support medication prevent complication infection . - Patients may undergo tumor biopsy ( removal small piece tumor tissue ) . - Patients evaluated laboratory test image test , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , 4 6 week treatment month 3 4 month determine response treatment . - Patients blood test 3 , 6 , 12 month annually 5 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Short-Term Cultured Anti-Tumor Autologous Lymphocytes After Lymphocyte-Depleting Chemotherapy Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes ( TIL ) mediate regression bulky metastatic melanoma administer autologous patient high dose ( HD ) IL-2 follow non-myeloablative ( NMA ) lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen . - Clinical investigation preclinical animal model demonstrate less time culture , long telomere , less differentiated lymphocyte phenotype associate TIL capable mediate objective clinical response persist long term host . - Previous method generate TIL require screen anti-tumor specificity use gamma-interferon ( IFN ) production TIL . However , vitro screen depends autologous tumor reagent often unavailable ; gamma-IFN release vitro may best correlate vivo efficacy . Additionally , method necessitates long vitro culture time ( 44 day ) , therefore reduce clonal heterogeneity TIL culture , result TIL culture short telomere length phenotype skew toward differentiate phenotype . - In Surgery Branch pre-clinical experiment , evaluate method rapidly generate young TIL melanoma tumor optimal phenotypic characteristic . Objectives : - In cohort 1 , determine ability autologous TIL cell infuse minimal vitro culture conjunction high dose aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) follow non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen mediate tumor regression patient metastatic melanoma . - In cohort 2 , determine ability autologous cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4+ ) cell deplete TIL cell infuse minimal vitro culture conjunction high dose aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) follow non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen mediate tumor regression patient metastatic melanoma . - In cohort 3 , determine ability autologous CD4+ cell deplete TIL cell infuse minimal vitro culture conjunction high dose aldesleukin follow chemoradiation lymphoid deplete regimen mediate complete tumor regression patient metastatic melanoma . - In prospective randomized fashion , compare ability autologous TIL cell ( cohort 4 ) autologous CD4plus cell deplete TIL cell ( cohort regimen , mediate tumor regression , progression free survival , overall survival patient metastatic melanoma . - Evaluate toxicity treatment regimen . - Determine rate repopulation young TIL cell treat patient establish vitro correlate TIL culture mediate objective response vivo persistence . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old must : - Metastatic melanoma ; - Normal value basic laboratory value . Patients may : - Received prior cell transfer therapy include non-myeloablative ablative chemotherapy ; - Concurrent major medical illness ; - Any form immunodeficiency ; - Severe hypersensitivity agent use study ; - Contraindications high dose IL-2 administration . Design : - Patients undergo resection obtain tumor generation autologous TIL culture . - Cohort 1 : - All patient receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg/kg/day IV ) day -7 -6 fludarabine ( 25 mg/m^2/day IV ) day -5 -1 . - On day 0 patient receive infusion autologous TIL begin high-dose aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg IV every 8 hour 15 dos ) . - Clinical Immunologic response evaluate 4-6 week TIL infusion . - Using small optimal two-stage Phase II design , initially 21 patient enrol , two first 21 patient clinical response ( partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) ) , accrual continue 41 patient , target 20 % goal objective response . Cohort 1 close amendment D. - Cohort 2 initiate amendment D whereby CD4+ cell eliminate culture , use Miltenyi Clinimacs apparatus , prior perform rapid expansion young TIL cell . Patients cohort 2 receive CD4+ cell deplete young unselected TIL . Patients also receive high dose IL-2 non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen describe cohort 1 . Clinical immunologic response evaluate 4-6 week TIL infusion . Using small optimal two-stage Phase II design , initially 18 patient enrol , three first 18 patient clinical response ( PR CR ) , accrual continue 35 patient , target 30 % goal objective response . With initiation Cohort 3 amendment H , patient accrue Cohort 2 eligible receive 600 cGy due prior radiation , inability mobilize cluster differentiation 34 ( CD34+ ) cell . Also time , accrual expand total 50 patient cohort 2 . Cohort 2 close amendment K. - Cohort 3 initiated amendment H , whereby patient receive chemoradiation lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide , fludarabine , 600 cGy total body irradiation follow intravenous infusion autologous CD4+ cell deplete young TIL plus IV high dose IL-2 . Clinical immunologic response evaluate 4-6 week TIL infusion . Using small optimal two-stage Phase II design , initially 26 patient enrol , one first 26 patient complete response ( CR ) , accrual continue 51 patient , target 10 % goal complete response . Cohort 3 close amendment K. Prospective randomization cohorts 4 5 : - Cohort 4 : - All patient receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg/kg/day IV ) day -7 -6 fludarabine ( 25 mg/m^2/day IV ) day -5 -1 . - On day 0 patient receive infusion autologous TIL begin high-dose aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg IV every 8 hour 15 dos ) . - Clinical immunologic response evaluate 4-6 week TIL infusion . - Cohort 5 - All patient receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg/kg/day IV ) day -7 -6 fludarabine ( 25 mg/m^2/day IV ) day -5 -1 . - On day 0 patient receive infusion autologous CD4+ deplete TIL begin high-dose aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg IV every 8 hour 15 dos ) . - Clinical immunologic response evaluate 4-6 week TIL infusion .</detailed_description>
