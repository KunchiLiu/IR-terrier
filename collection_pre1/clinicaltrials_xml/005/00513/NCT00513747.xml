	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , fludarabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving fludarabine together rituximab may kill cancer cell . Sometimes cancer may need treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . It yet know whether give fludarabine together rituximab early effective give fludarabine rituximab observation treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study fludarabine rituximab compare well work give early observation treat patient previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Delayed Fludarabine Rituximab Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine early treatment chemoimmunotherapy comprise fludarabine phosphate rituximab extend time second treatment patient genetically high-risk ( unmutated IgV_H ) , asymptomatic , previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . - To determine time disease progression would warrant second treatment . - To determine overall survival . Secondary - To measure proportion patient asymptomatic , previously untreated CLL mutate unmutated IgV_H gene . - To determine difference acute chronic toxicity administer chemoimmunotherapy early patient genetically high-risk CLL compare waiting symptom develop . - To determine effect select pretreatment clinical biological characteristic ( interphase cytogenetic abnormality , ZAP-70 expression , p53 dysfunction [ primary secondary ] ) response , time second treatment , overall survival patient genetically high-risk CLL randomize early treatment . - To determine effect select pretreatment clinical biological characteristic ( interphase cytogenetic abnormality , ZAP-70 expression , p53 dysfunction ) response , time first second treatment , overall survival patient genetically high-risk CLL randomize standard treatment ( observation symptom occur ) . - To describe natural history patient genetically low-risk ( mutate IgV_H gene ) , asymptomatic , previously untreated CLL , term time initial treatment , response , progression , survival . - To determine effect select pretreatment characteristic time first treatment , response , progression , survival patient genetically low-risk CLL . - To correlate pattern resistance emerge patient unmutated IgV_H gene relapse refractory CLL follow receipt chemoimmunotherapy clonal evolution , include acquisition high-risk karyotype abnormality , p53 mutation , p53 dysfunction ( primary secondary ) , alter mRNA protein expression relate treatment resistance , DNA mutation , microRNA gene expression , methylation change . - To determine whether highly sensitive flow cytometry negativity completion therapy patient randomize early treatment effective surrogate marker prolong time second treatment , overall survival , clinical benefit . - To collect demographic data familial CLL newly diagnose patient participate study . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Genetically high-risk disease : Patients stratify accord age ( &lt; 50 year vs 50 70 year vs &gt; 70 year ) presence high-risk genetic feature [ del ( 11 ) ( q22.3 ) del ( 17 ) ( p13.1 ) ] FISH ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive rituximab IV 4 hour day 1 , 3 , 5 week 1 day 1 week 5 , 9 , 13 , 17 , 21 . Patients also receive fludarabine phosphate IV 30 minute day 1-5 week 1 , 5 , 9 , 13 , 17 , 21 . After completion chemoimmunotherapy , patient follow every 3 month disease progression . At time disease progression , patient receive retreatment chemoimmunotherapy another treatment regimen . - Arm II : Patients follow every 3 month disease progression . At time disease progression , patient receive rituximab fludarabine phosphate arm I . Patients follow every 3 month second disease progression . Patients second disease progression receive retreatment chemoimmunotherapy another treatment regimen . - Genetically low-risk disease : Patients follow every 3 month disease progression . At time disease progression , patient receive rituximab fludarabine phosphate arm I . Patients follow every 3 month second disease progression . Patients second disease progression receive retreatment chemoimmunotherapy another treatment regimen . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically correlative study . After finish treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria PreRegistration : 1 . Patients must within 6 month initial flow cytometric confirmation Bcell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . This interval begin initial flow cytometric confirmation disease . 2 . Clinical immunophenotypic evidence CLL include : 2.1 An absolute lymphocytosis &gt; 5,000/μL Morphologically , lymphocytes must appear mature &lt; 55 % prolymphocytes . Local institution lymphocyte phenotype must reveal predominant Bcell monoclonal population share Bcell marker ( CD19 , CD20 , CD23 ) CD5 antigen , absence panTcell marker . Additionally , Bcells must monoclonal regard expression either κ λ surface immunoglobulin expression low density . Patients bright surface immunoglobulin level must CD23 coexpression absence ( 11 ; 14 ) interphase cytogenetics negative tumor protein stain cyclin D1 . 2.2 Staging Patients must low category ( i.e. , stag 0 I ) modify threestage Rai stag system describe protocol . 3 . Patients evidence active disease demonstrate follow criterion : Splenomegaly and/or massive/progressive lymphadenopathy would require therapy Presence weight loss &gt; 10 % precede 6 month period Grade 2 3 fatigue Fevers &gt; 100.5°F night sweat great 2 week without evidence infection Progressive lymphocytosis increase &gt; 50 % 2 month period anticipate doubling time le 6 month . 4 . Prior Treatment : No prior therapy CLL include corticosteroid autoimmune complication develop since initial diagnosis CLL . 5 . Age ≥ 18 year 6 . Performance Status 0 1 . 7 . No HIV disease . Due alteration host immunity , patient know HIV infection may enrol . 8 . Nonpregnant nonnursing . Due unknown teratogenic potential chemotherapy , pregnant nursing woman may enrol . Women men reproductive potential agree use effective mean birth control . 9 . Required Initial Laboratory Values : Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal Eligibility Criteria Registration ( LowRisk Cohort HighRisk Cohort Randomization Early Intervention Versus Observation Later Treatment ) 1 . Successful determination IgVH mutational status reference laboratory . 2 . Absence progression CLL , i.e. , absence following : Progressive splenomegaly and/or lymphadenopathy two independent measure space two week apart . If one assessment note progression , repeat prior reregistration . Development anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 11 g/dL ) thrombocytopenia ( platelet &lt; 100,000/μL ) . Progressive lymphocytosis increase &gt; 50 % 2 month period anticipate doubling time le 6 month . Symptoms referable CLL , include weight loss &gt; 10 % precede 6 month period ; grade 2 3 fatigue ; fever &gt; 100.5°F and/or night sweat great 2 week without evidence infection . 3 . Required Laboratory Value : Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal</criteria>
