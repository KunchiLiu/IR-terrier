	<brief_summary>The adenosine receptor know anti-inflammatory action could therefore potential target treatment sepsis septic shock . Stimulation adenosine receptor could potentially lead decrease inflammation tissue damage . Under normal condition adenosine form either intracellular 5 ` nucleotidase , dephosphorylates AMP , hydrolysis S-adenosylhomcysteine hydrolase . An alternative pathway AMP degradation provide cytosolic enzyme AMP deaminase ( AMPD ) , catalyse irreversible deamination AMP inosine monophosphate ammonia . In human four AMPD isoforms describe , name source initially purify ; M ( muscle ) , L ( liver ) , E1 E2 ( erythrocyte ) , encode AMPD1 , AMPD2 AMPD3 . Approximately 15-20 % Caucasian African American individual heterozygous homozygous 34C &gt; T variant AMPD1 . We hypothesize healthy volunteer polymorphism AMPD1 less severe inflammatory response LPS show le ( severe ) organ failure . This hypothesis base expect high level adenosine patient AMPD1 polymorphism . This hypothesis strengthen fact patient coronary artery disease AMPD1 polymorphism show improve cardiovascular survival ( Anderson JL et al . J Am Coll Cardiol 2000 ; 36 : 1248-52 ) possibly base high adenosine level reduce AMPD activity . Furthermore polymorphism predict improved clinical outcome patient heart failure ( Loh E et al . Circulation 1999 ) also base hypothetical elevation adenosine . We hypothesize : The C34T-polymorphism enzyme AMP-deaminase lead decreased inflammatory respons thereby decrease LPS-induced tissue damage . A second hypothesis base antagonism adenosine receptor , caffeine ; Antagonism adenosine receptor caffeine lead increase LPS-induced inflammatory reaction increase ( subclinical ) tissue damage ?</brief_summary>
