	<brief_title>Zinc Adjunct Treatment Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community-acquired pneumonia common potentially serious infection affect child worldwide . The annual incidence pneumonia child younger five year age 34 40 case per 1000 Europe North America , high time life [ 1 ] . In develop country , pneumonia common develop world ( 5 10 % child &lt; 5 year old ) , also severe large cause death child [ 1 , 2 ] . About 20 % deaths child younger five year age attributable pneumonia ( 1.9 million death per year ) [ 3 ] . More 90 % deaths resource-poor country . Zinc deficiency widespread develop country recognize impair growth immune function [ 4 ] . Andean area include region high risk zinc deficiency worldwide [ 5 ] . In Ecuador , 33 % child suffer zinc deficiency . However , coast Ecuador , Guayaquil locate , prevalence zinc deficiency 37 % base plasma zinc concentration 70 micrograms/dl [ 6 ] . Stunting , may result chronic zinc undernutrition present 21.9 % child Guayaquil [ 7 ] . In addition , previous study , report low dietary zinc intake child 12 59 month [ 8 ] . In urban area Ecuador , breast-feeding widely practice , could put young child risk zinc deficiency [ 9 ] . Zinc consider abundant intracellular micronutrient participates wide range cellular process play central role immune response pathogens [ 10 ] . We previously demonstrate zinc supplementation Ecuadorian child cause increase response delay type hypersensitivity test multiple pathogen-derived antigen [ 8 ] . There data available determine whether etiology pneumonia dependent child´s zinc status . In general , bronchiolitis upper respiratory tract infection likely viral , whereas case severe pneumonia pneumonia-related death likely bacterial [ 1 ] . Recently , one vitro study find zinc mediate antiviral activity respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) , etiological agent pneumonia child , alter ability cell support RSV replication [ 11 ] . If zinc status influence etiology pneumonia , suggest zinc deficiency might associate `` selective acquire immunodeficiency '' . Meta-analyses show zinc supplementation useful diarrhea pneumonia prevention develop country [ 12 , 13 ] . It extensively show zinc important adjunct diarrhea treatment [ 13 ] . With regard pneumonia , three recent study report use zinc adjunct antimicrobial treatment pneumonia child . A clinical study perform Kolkata , India , child acute low respiratory infection give zinc supplement , demonstrate significant reduction duration fever ill status boy , girl [ 14 ] . The weakness trial include small sample size fact observe beneficial effect base subgroup analysis . Another study perform Vellore , India , large group child young 2 year age , demonstrate zinc , adjunct antimicrobial treatment , overall effect duration hospitalization clinical sign associate pneumonia [ 15 ] . In addition , Bose et al report use zinc associate increased duration clinical sign pneumonia . These different finding could explain dissimilarity geographical location mean basal plasma zinc concentration study ( Kolkata : 63 µg/dl vs. Vellore : 72 µg/dl ) . Nevertheless , clinical trial perform Bangladesh report use zinc adjunct treatment severe pneumonia child reduce duration clinical manifestation disease include chest indrawing , tachypnea , hypoxia , length hospitalization [ 16 ] . This study sample size similar trial Vellore [ 15 ] thus adequate power . In summary , conflict result effect zinc give severe pneumonia episode young child . Pneumonia etiology one factor extensively discuss possible mechanism explain controversial finding study . Bose et al . suggest increased duration pneumonia sign zinc supplementation might due different etiology pneumonia [ 15 ] . Brooks et al . speculate observed reduction pneumonia duration might explain zinc 's role acute phase response pathogens [ 16 ] . However , present evidence show zinc supplementation etiology-dependent effect clinical evolution pneumonia . In recent editorial , Hambidge also suggest controversial finding three study could due basal zinc status intervention group , associate pneumonia pathogen , age enrol child [ 17 ] . Consequently , clarify role zinc relation pneumonia , study determine whether low baseline zinc status associate etiology pneumonia . This potential finding may strengthen scientific evidence support mass population zinc supplementation . Furthermore , study also establish zinc use treatment adjunct severe pneumonia episode result rapid clinical recovery pneumonia . Moreover , study intend evaluate effect zinc , use adjunct treatment pneumonia , clinical evolution correlation etiology pneumonia Ecuadorian child compare placebo .</detailed_description>
