	<detailed_description>Cumulative experimental pathological evidence support postulate inflammation may serve unify concept pathogenesis atherosclerosis complication . Aneurysmal disease associate inflammatory cell infiltrate enzymatic degradation vessel wall . Although risk abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) rupture relate maximum cross-sectional diameter , rapid expansion aortic diameter precede fissuration rupture observe AAA independently initial size . However , current diagnostic modality stratify risk AAA rupture base solely size aneurysm without factor potentially useful information derivable degree aneurysmal wall inflammatory response . We propose utilize fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) image co-registered structural computerize tomography ( CT ) image vivo localization quantification vascular inflammation patient AAA order determine whether increase inflammation within wall aneurysm correlate rapid enlargement AAA ( change aneurysmal diameter within 6 month ) , symptom , thrombosis , intervention rupture , leak , rapidly expand , painful AAAs . In patient underlie abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) , progression disease i.e . expansion associate increased inflammation within aneurysm wall characterize FDG-PET/CT , degree inflammation risk predictor adverse event . Prior study demonstrate FDG uptake great inflamed tissue , infectious focus tumor . In chronic inflammatory lesion malignancy , FDG uptake increase macrophage-dense region . The relatively high uptake FDG macrophage attribute relatively high metabolic rate macrophage , inability macrophage store glycogen , make reliant upon external glucose source fuel . Activation macrophages increase glucose consumption . Both animal model human , inflame blood vessel show increased uptake FDG . Several investigator show FDG-PET reliably detect inflammation atherosclerosis . Thus detection enhance FDG uptake aneurysmal wall patient AAA may potential significance .</detailed_description>
