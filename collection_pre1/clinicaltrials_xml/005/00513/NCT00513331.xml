	<detailed_description>Barrett 's esophagus ( BE ) know premalignant condition esophagus , predispose development esophageal adenocarcinoma . BE represent change lining ( mucosa ) esophagus know produce result chronic gastroesophageal reflux . The current standard care patient BE include serial performance upper endoscopy multiple biopsy , perform designated time interval . However , emergence new technology management condition make care patient non-uniform , subject bias individual treating physician . The protocol The Valley Hospital Blumenthal Cancer Center aim standardize management patient Barrett 's esophagus , without dysplasia , use evidence-based , cut edge diagnostic therapeutic algorithm technique radiofrequency ablation , endoscopic mucosal resection , surveillance endoscopy biopsy . If biopsy suggest development carcinoma high grade dysplasia surgical removal esophagus recommend . This study aim look long-term efficacy procedure . In addition , data regard clinical outcome collect well blood , tissue surgical specimen proteomic analysis hop identify biomarkers associate progression dysplasia adenocarcinoma . Although patient ultimately make informed decision regard management BE , protocol serf unify physician recommendation , allow collection interpretation data .</detailed_description>
