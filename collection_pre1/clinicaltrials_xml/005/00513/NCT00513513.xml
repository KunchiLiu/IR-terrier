	<brief_title>TMC114-C227 : A Study Evaluate Effectiveness Safety TMC114 ( Darunavir ) With Low Dose Ritonavir Monotherapy ( Other Anti-HIV Drugs Will Given ) Patients Who Have Never Been Treated With Antiretrovirals ( Anti-HIV Drugs ) Previously</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label ( placebo ) , uncontrolled ( patient receive TMC114 ritonavir dose , trial investigate sustain anti-viral activity TMC114/rtv monotherapy 24 treatment naïve , HIV 1 infected patient period 48 weeks.TMC114 , 800 mg daily ( 2 tablet 400 mg [ F021 ] ) give together 1 capsule ( 100 mg ) ritonavir.Initially 11 subject ( Panel A , screen viral load 10000 100000 copies/mL ) include follow 8 week . If 8 week dose least 7 subject virologically respond ( viral load &lt; 400 copies/mL ) , 13 additional patient ( Panel B ) include . If virologic failure observe least 18 24 patient complete 8 week dose , trial continue plan . In case 6 patient Panel A Panel B develop virologic failure 8 week treatment , trial stop conclude treatment effective.The 13 additional patient enrol Panel B screen viral load 20000 500000 copies/mL . The CD4+ cell count 24 patient &gt; 100 cells/µL screening . The patient 's medical condition , adverse event ( side effect ) , study medication compliance , laboratory evaluation effectiveness safety assess regular interval . At end 48 week treatment period patient follow additional 4 week evaluate side effect laboratory abnormality . Treatment TMC114/rtv extend patient continue benefit 48 week . 2 oral tablet TMC114 400 mg administer daily 1 capsule ( 100mg ) ritonavir 48 week .</detailed_description>
