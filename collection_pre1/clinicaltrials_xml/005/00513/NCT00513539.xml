	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biliary stenting placement tube bile duct keep blocked area open . Photodynamic therapy use drug , porfimer sodium , absorbed tumor cell . The drug become active expose light . When drug active , tumor cell kill . It yet know whether biliary stenting effective without photodynamic therapy treat patient biliary tract tumor . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study biliary stenting see well work compare biliary stenting photodynamic therapy use porfimer sodium treat patient locally advance , recurrent , metastatic cholangiocarcinoma biliary tract tumor remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biliary Stenting With Without Photodynamic Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Advanced , Recurrent , Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma Other Biliary Tract Tumors That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess efficacy , term overall survival , biliary stenting v without photodynamic therapy use porfimer sodium advance , recurrent , metastatic biliary tract carcinoma . Secondary - To evaluate two treatment arm respect progression-free survival , toxicity use NCI Common Toxicity Criteria ( version 3.0 ) , quality life . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify participate center , primary site ( gallbladder v bile duct ) , disease stage ( locally advance vs metastatic ) , prior therapy ( i.e. , surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy ) ( yes v ) , performance score ( 0 vs 1 v 2 v 3 ) , prior treatment arm UK chemotherapy trial ABC-02 ( gemcitabine hydrochloride alone vs gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin ) . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo either endoscopic percutaneous drainage insertion unilateral bilateral plastic endoprostheses main stricture right leave hepatic bile duct . - Arm II : Patients undergo treatment arm I . Patients also receive porfimer sodium IV undergo laser activation 48 hour later . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month least 3 year .
