	<brief_title>AZD0530 Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test hypothesis AZD0530 improve prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate progression-free survival ( PFS ) comparison historical control patient hormone-refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) . II . Evaluate time treatment failure overall survival patient HRPC treat AZD0530 . III . Evaluate toxicity tolerance AZD0530 therapy HRPC population . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral AZD0530 daily . Treatment repeat every 4 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month first 2 year yearly thereafter .</detailed_description>
