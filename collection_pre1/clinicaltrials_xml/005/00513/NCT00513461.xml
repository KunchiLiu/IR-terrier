	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine whether treatment SAMe 24 week reduce serum level alpha-fetoprotein ( AFP ) patient advance liver disease due chronic hepatitis C. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine whether treatment SAMe 24 week reduce serum level des-gamma carboxyprothrombin ( DCP ) alpha-fetoprotein-L3 ( AFP-L3 ) patient advance liver disease due chronic hepatitis C ( hepatocellular carcinoma tumor marker ) . II . To determine whether treatment SAMe 24 week alters biochemical marker liver disease ( e.g. , serum alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] , aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ] , albumin , bilirubin , etc . ) hepatitis C viral load patient advance liver disease due chronic hepatitis C ( hepatitis C liver disease ) . III . To determine whether treatment SAMe 24 week reduce serum level tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , plasma level malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , 4-hydroxynonenal ( 4-HNE ) urine level F2-isoprostane patient advance liver disease due chronic hepatitis C ( oxidative stress ) . IV . To determine whether treatment SAMe 24 week reduce plasma level methionine homocysteine increase plasma glutathione ( GSH ) SAMe patient advance liver disease due chronic hepatitis C ( SAMe metabolites ) . V. To determine safety , tolerability quality life SAMe treatment ( 2,400 mg/day ) 24 week patient advance liver disease due chronic hepatitis C. OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive SAMe orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 24 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO daily ( QD ) week 1-4 , PO BID week 5-8 , PO three time daily ( TID ) week 9-24 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 week .</detailed_description>
