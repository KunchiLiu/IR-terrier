	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Ultrase® MT20 Improving Coefficient Fat Absorption ( CFA ) Children With Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) Pancreatic Insufficiency ( PI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III , multicenter , open-label study , quantify improvement nutrient absorption participant receive Ultrase® MT20 . The improvement demonstrate compare CFA percent ( % ) CNA % obtain washout enzyme CFA % CNA % obtained period treatment Ultrase® MT20 . The study also design obtain safety data CF child suffer also PI take Ultrase® MT20 . The total duration participation child study approximately 38 day include 3 phase : screening phase , washout phase treatment phase . Screening phase : phase last 15 day participant take Ultrase® MT20 per investigator 's discretion period . During last 4 day , participant stabilize high fat diet Ultrase® MT20 . The individual 'stabilized dose ' Ultrase® MT20 capsule determine participant base average number capsule Ultrase® MT20 take last 4 day . Washout phase : phase last 6 7 day . The participant continue high-fat diet refrain take Ultrase® MT20 enzymes . A 72-hour stool collection perform food consume participant record assess CFA % CNA % . Treatment phase : phase last 7 11 day . The participant continue high-fat diet take 'stabilized dose ' Ultrase® MT20 establish screen . Another 72-hour stool collection perform food consume participant record assess CFA % CNA % .</detailed_description>
