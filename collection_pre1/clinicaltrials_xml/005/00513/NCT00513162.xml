	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - Determine interindividual range median individual maximum tolerate dos valproic acid administer one time even dose conjunction dose oral etoposide ( 50 mg/m2/day child , 25mg/m2/day adult start ) four different age group . Secondary Objectives : - Determine qualitative quantitative toxicity reversibility toxicity valproic acid conjunction oral etoposide , - To investigate clinical pharmacokinetics valproic acid give conjunction oral etoposide , - To describe quality life patient relapse , progressive central peripheral nervous system tumor treat oral valproic acid etoposide , - To observe describe response pattern progressive central nervous system tumor treat oral valproic acid etoposide , - To observe describe event free survival time overall survival time patient relapse , progressive central nervous system tumor treat oral valproic acid etoposide , - To determine histone deacetylase activity topoisomerase expression lymphocytes patient related valproic acid level , - To determine , individual maximal tolerate dose ( iMTD ) depend initial performance status patient begin treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Drugs : Etoposide design block cell growth break DNA , may cause cell die . Valproic acid first design anti-seizure medication . It also find change cancer cell make sensitive etoposide . Screening Tests : Before start treatment study , `` screening test '' . These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . - Your medical history review . - You physical exam . - You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status evaluation ) . - You complete questionnaire activity daily live . The questionnaire take 5 10 minute complete . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . This routine blood draw may include pregnancy test woman able child . To eligible take part study , pregnancy test must negative . - Urine may collect check metabolic disease . This urine sample may include pregnancy test woman able child . To eligible take part study , pregnancy test must negative . - You magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan . - If doctor think necessary , may additional blood and/or urine test . Dose Escalation : When begin study , begin receive low dose level valproic acid . Every week , dose increase . This continue maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) find . Once MTD find , continue receive dose level valproic acid study . However , doctor think necessary , dose level could lower . If child ( less equal 18 year age ) , amount etoposide take study change . If adult ( 18 year age ) , receive low dose etoposide MTD valproic acid find . After MTD valproic acid find , dose etoposide increase every week MTD find . However , doctor think necessary , dose level could lower . Study Drug Administration : You receive valproic acid etoposide every evening pill form . If difficulty swallow pill , etoposide give even liquid form . Valproic acid give liquid form , divide 2 dos per day , 1 morning 1 evening . Study Visits During Dose Escalation : While valproic acid etoposide medication increase , every week physical exam blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . Every month , CT MRI scan check status disease . You may test procedure often doctor think necessary . Study Visits After Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) : Every month , physical exam , blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . Every month , CT MRI scan check status disease . Every 6 month , portion blood urine collect routine test use pregnancy test woman able child . -You may test procedure often doctor think necessary . Length Study : You may remain study 2 year . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . End-of-Study Visit : Once study , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - If doctor think necessary , CT MRI check status disease . Follow-Up : Once study , contact telephone year check status disease . The phone call take 2-3 minute . This investigational study . Etoposide FDA approve commercially available . Valproic acid FDA approve commercially available treatment seizure . The use drug together investigational . Up 120 patient take part multicenter study . Up 100 enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
