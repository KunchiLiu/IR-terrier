	<brief_title>Effectiveness Arginine Treatment Sickle Cell Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCD inherit blood disorder . Symptoms include anemia , infection , organ damage , intense episode pain call `` sickle cell crisis . '' SCD cause abnormal type hemoglobin , protein inside red blood cell carry oxygen . In people SCD , abnormal hemoglobin distorts shape red blood cell . This cause red blood cell clump together , decrease blood flow oxygen delivery body 's tissue . The reduced level oxygen lead sickle cell crises tissue damage . Hemolysis , destruction red blood cell , also hallmark SCD . During hemolysis , hemoglobin release bloodstream , remove nitric oxide ( NO ) , natural chemical body expand blood vessel . Arginase , another protein release hemolysis , remove arginine bloodstream , also lead decrease NO level . The lack NO constrict blood vessel , contribute painful sickle cell crisis . Arginine supplementation may increase healthy hemoglobin NO production , turn , prevent reduce sickle cell crisis . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness arginine increase NO level , improve red blood cell function , reduce hospitalization pain medication use people SCD . This study enroll child adult SCD . Participants randomly assign receive twice daily dos either low dose arginine , high dose arginine , placebo 12 week . Study visit occur baseline , three time Month 1 , Weeks 8 , 12 , 14 , 16 . Each study visit include echocardiogram measure heart activity , blood collection , medical history review identify adverse event , pain medication usage , headache , emergency department visit , hospitalization .</detailed_description>
