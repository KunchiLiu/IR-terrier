Dose ( ) regimen ( ) topical therapy ( y ) subject receive Baseline visit , area palm , soles foot , axilla groin , ( ) increase four week precede Baseline visit . Subject likely require initiation new topical therapy treatment psoriasis corticosteroid , vitamin D analog , retinoids first 16 week follow Baseline visit .

Dose ( ) regimen ( ) corticosteroid therapy ( y ) subject receive Baseline visit , ( ) increase four week precede Baseline visit . Subject likely require initiation oral injectable dose corticosteroid therapy treatment psoriasis first 16 week follow Baseline visit .

Regimen ( ) concomitant UVB phototherapy subject receive Baseline visit ( ) increase four week precede Baseline visit . Subject likely require initiation UVB therapy first 16 week follow Baseline visit . Subject treat psoralen UVA ( PUVA ) phototherapy within last four week prior Baseline visit . Subject likely require PUVA phototherapy course study . Subject avoid excessive sun exposure use tan booth least 2 week prior Baseline first 16 week follow Baseline visit . Systemic Therapies : Subject initiate new systemic agent treatment psoriasis within last four week prior Baseline visit . Dose ( ) regimen ( ) systemic therapy ( y ) subject receive Baseline visit , ( ) increase four week precede Baseline visit .

Has latent TB ( positive purify protein derivative ( PPD ) skin test , twostep PPD applicable , chest Xray indicative TB ) risk factor activation latent TB , e.g . previous exposure TB , initiate TB prophylaxis prior first adalimumab treatment . In either case , Abbott Medical Advisor must contact initiate study treatment . Subjects exclude CXR find change suggestive old heal tuberculous lesion ( e.g . calcified nodule , fibrotic scar , apical basilar pleural thicken etc . ) .</criteria>
