	<brief_summary>Background—Despite pivotal pathogenic role platelet atherothrombosis widely recognize , strike lack consensus regard measure platelet function monitor effect various antiplatelet drug . In view fact recurrent ischemic event occur 8.5 % 8.8 % patient treat dual antiplatelet drug significant inter-individual variability platelet reactivity , believe importance platelet function assessment clinical implication overlook .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet Function Assessment Atherothrombotic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods Expected Results—In prospective follow-up study , assess predictive power different assay platelet function ( PFA-100 , plasma level von Willebrand factor , P-selectin , soluble CD40 ligand , myeloid-related protein-8/14 , ADP-induced P-selectin [ CD62P ] expression platelet flow cytometry ) high-dose ( 600 mg ) clopidogrel loading , 3-month follow-up , study end occurrence major cardiovascular event ( MACE ) ( death , myocardial infarction , stroke , coronary revascularization ) . We also evaluate correlation different assay platelet function . Based previous pilot study demonstrate significant association collagen-ADP closure time measure PFA-100 occurrence major cardiovascular event 130 patient undergoing coronary angioplasty follow 6 month , plan include 150-200 patient present study . The total inclusion period estimate 1 year . Therefore , total 2 2.5 year need complete study . In first year , analyze ( 1 ) correlation various platelet parameter coronary angiographic finding ; ( 2 ) correlation among different platelet function measurement ; ( 3 ) responsiveness CADP-CT high-dose clopidogrel loading . In second year , ( 1 ) analyze predictability various platelet parameter , different point time ( baseline , clopidogrel loading , study end ) , occurrence MACE ( 2 ) establish risk-prediction schema patient undergoing coronary angioplasty . A pre-defined threshold value collagen-epinephrine closure time set 190 , since value recommend investigator differentiate presence absence aspirin resistance . A pre-defined threshold value collagen-ADP closure time set 90 , since find pilot study value associate best discriminate ability identify patient develop MACE . In third year , genetic background determine PFA-100 closure time level plasma marker platelet activation explore analyze relationship various SNP/haplotype pattern value different platelet function assessment . Clinical Significance—The present study first explore clinical role platelet function assessment baseline , high-dose clopidogrel loading , study end . It may give u great insight regard treat high-risk patient adequately antiplatelet agent .</detailed_description>
