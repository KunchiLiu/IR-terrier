	<brief_title>The Natural History Community-Associated MRSA Infections Decolonization Strategies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infections community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( CA-MRSA ) range severity superficial skin abscess invasive soft tissue infection like cellulitis pyomyositis . There large increase number patient present institution CA-MRSA infection . Colonization S. aureus ( SA ) may link development infection data phenomenon limit . The recurrence rate CA-MRSA soft tissue infection unknown . A variety decolonization strategy use infection prophylaxis vary result , primarily patient undergo hemodialysis surgery . This study seek determine recurrence rate soft tissue infection among patient CA-MRSA infection determine reasonable efficacious decolonization strategy eradicate CA-MRSA previously infect patient . The propose method decolonization test randomize control trial four intervention arm . The intervention arm : ( 1 ) intensive education prevention skin infection improvement personal hygiene ( also serve `` control group '' ) , ( 2 ) application mupirocin nasal mucosa alone , ( 3 ) combination nasal application mupirocin chlorhexidine shower , ( 4 ) combination nasal application mupirocin bath dilute bleach water . The `` control '' group well three arm receive intensive hygiene education . Decolonization mupirocin ointment chlorhexidine shower dilute bleach baths combination likely successful either application nasal mupirocin ointment alone hygiene measure alone . It expect decolonization method result 50 % relative reduction MRSA colonization 6 month .</detailed_description>
