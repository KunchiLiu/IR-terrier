	<brief_title>Efficacy Polyphenols From Milk Dark Chocolate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dark chocolate one richest source polyphenols , example , standard 40g portion dark chocolate contain 400-800 mg polyphenols , compare red wine ( 170 mg /100ml ) apple ( 200 mg/piece ) . Cocoa polyphenols , notably catechin , exist lipid water-based environment ( amphipathic ) , mean spare lipophilic hydrophilic vitamin . There number human trial conduct use chocolate cocoa measure various endpoint . Most conducted dark chocolate . An article Nature find bioavailability epicatechin milk chocolate substantially reduce compare dark , even dark take glass milk ( Serafini et al 2003 ) . The hypothesis milk proteins bind polyphenols , make unavailable . Subsequent study able reproduce , none conduct use solid chocolate first study , do use drink matrix , may completely alter bind interaction polyphenols protein . To end , study design compare solid chocolate source polyphenols improve risk biomarker vascular disease . This study design blind , three arm crossover trial . The primary outcome measure compare endothelial function consumption 3 chocolate ( 1 milk , 1 dark , 1 polyphenol-free control ) secondary outcome arterial stiffness . All volunteer take chocolate type crossover design . Subjects undergo medical screening , anthropometry , physical activity dietary assessment randomization order consumption .</detailed_description>
