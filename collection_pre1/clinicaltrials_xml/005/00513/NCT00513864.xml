	<detailed_description>Codeine pro-drug analgesic activity dependent metabolism codeine morphine . The metabolism codeine morphine catalyze cytochrome P450 enzyme 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) 70 genetic variant lead differ metabolic capability within population . It hypothesize change PPT/PTT vary base individual ability convert morphine codeine . Ineffective analgesic management patient sickle cell disease remain major problem management disorder adult child . The pharmacological treatment acute chronic pain condition result vaso-occlusive crisis child sickle cell disease typically involve use opioids . In outpatient setting , commonly achieve administration codeine and/or tramadol , substrates cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) . Currently drug use patient population without information concern patient 's capacity metabolize CYP2D6 substrates may lead treatment pain depend CYP2D6 activity . The propose objective application address issue development pharmacodynamic assessment tool objectively assess response morphine term analgesic response ( pharmacodynamic assessment ) . This new tool might also serve non-invasive technique CYP2D6 phenotyping CYP2D6 substrate use pain therapy assess specifically morphine response . Development novel assessment tool result improve opioid analgesic therapy population . Future anticipated study examine application technique determination opioid tolerance hyperalgesia .</detailed_description>
