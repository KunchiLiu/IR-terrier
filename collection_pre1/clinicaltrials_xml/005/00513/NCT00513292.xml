	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study give fluorouracil together epirubicin cyclophosphamide follow paclitaxel trastuzumab see well work compare give paclitaxel together trastuzumab follow fluorouracil , epirubicin , cyclophosphamide , trastuzumab treat woman palpable breast cancer remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether effective give combination chemotherapy treatment paclitaxel plus trastuzumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Paclitaxel Plus Trastuzumab Treating Women With Palpable Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The primary objective study compare pathologic complete response rate ( pCR ) within breast sequential regimen concurrent weekly paclitaxel trastuzumab , follow continued weekly trastuzumab administer concurrently FEC-75 ( Arm 2 ) , pCR rate sequential regimen FEC-75 alone follow concurrent weekly paclitaxel trastuzumab ( Arm 1 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate cardiotoxicity sequential regimen concurrent weekly paclitaxel trastuzumab , follow continued weekly trastuzumab administer concurrently FEC-75 , follow postoperatively q 3 week trastuzumab total duration trastuzumab therapy 52 week first dose ( Arm 2 ) , compare cardiotoxicity sequential regimen FEC-75 alone follow concurrent weekly paclitaxel trastuzumab , follow q 3 week trastuzumab total duration trastuzumab therapy 52 week first dose ( Arm 1 ) . II . To compare combined pCR rate breast ipsilateral axilla obtain two regimen evaluate study . III . To compare clinical response rate ( cRR ) two regimen evaluate study . IV . To compare non-cardiac toxicity two regimen evaluate study . V. To compare breast conservation rate achieve two regimen evaluate study . VI . To evaluate disease-free survival overall survival 5 year post-randomization . VII . To correlate pCR rate potential molecular marker response . OUTLINE : Patients stratify clinical tumor size ( breast tumor size &lt; 2 cm nodal metastases &lt; 2 cm v breast tumor size &lt; 2 cm nodal metastases ≥ 2 cm v breast tumor size 2-4 cm [ nodal status ] v breast tumor size ≥ 4 cm [ nodal status ] ) , age ( &lt; 50 v ≥ 50 ) hormone receptor status ( estrogen receptor [ ER ] - progesterone receptor [ PgR ] -negative v ER- and/or PgR-positive ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive FEC comprise fluoroucacil intravenously ( IV ) , epirubicin hydrochloride IV , cyclophosphamide IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course . Beginning 21 day completion FEC , patient receive paclitaxel IV weekly trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) IV weekly 12 week . Within 6 week completion paclitaxel trastuzumab , patient undergo surgery . Beginning 3-4 week surgery , patient receive trastuzumab IV every 3 week 52 week . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel IV weekly trastuzumab IV weekly 12 week . Beginning 7 day completion paclitaxel trastuzumab , patient receive FEC comprise fluoroucacil IV , epirubicin IV , cyclophosphamide IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course . Patients also receive trastuzumab IV weekly additional 12 week . Within 6 week completion FEC trastuzumab , patient undergo surgery . Beginning 3-4 week surgery , patient receive trastuzumab arm I . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 4 year .</detailed_description>
