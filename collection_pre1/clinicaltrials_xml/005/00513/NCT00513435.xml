	<brief_title>Saracatinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine median progression-free survival patient advance recurrent squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( HNSCC ) treat AZD0530 ( saracatinib ) . SECONDARY OBJEC TIVES : I . To determine overall survival patient advance recurrent HNSCC treat AZD0530 . II . To determine objective response rate patient advance recurrent HNSCC treat AZD0530 . III . For patient accessible tumor , perform pre post-treatment biopsy ass pharmacodynamic effect AZD0530 c-Src downstream signal molecule STAT3 STAT5 . OUTLINE : Patients receive saracatinib orally ( PO ) percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) tube daily ( QD ) day 1-56 . Courses repeat every 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 week periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
