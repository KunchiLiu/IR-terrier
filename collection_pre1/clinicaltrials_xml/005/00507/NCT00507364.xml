	<brief_summary>Chronic anal fissure linear tear distal anal canal . Most chronic fissure require intervention heal . Surgical sphincterotomy currently perform . However , procedure permanently weaken internal sphincter may associate permanent complication incontinence . Current topical treatment `` chemical sphincterotomy '' effective short term 70 % patient 50 % suffer recurrence . Number study support hypothesis local ischemia reason failure heal anal fissure . Treatment refractory wound macrophage suspension innovative method since 1995 , macrophage suspension use successfully 1400 patient several hospital Israel without side effect.Macrophages key function almost every stage wind heal . They help digestion bacteria , later stage , secret IL-6 , influence endothelial cell proliferation initiation angiogenesis . The study hypothesis local injection activate human macrophage chronic anal fissure may induce fissure healing .</brief_summary>
