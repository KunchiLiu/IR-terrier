	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION The existence , diagnosis treatment short esophagus one controversy past within esophageal surgery recently re-emerge . This entity describe detail radiologist 60 's . Many surgeon confirm existence operating room , describe clinical , anatomical surgical pattern along modality surgical treatment shorten esophagus follow progressive fibrosis retraction esophageal wall consequent severe long stand gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) . Contrarily surgeon deny existence claim gastro-oesophageal junction reduce abdomen without tension virtually patient esophagus , fact , shorten . In case series open antireflux surgery , percentage dedicate procedure aim treat condition non-reducibility gastro-esophageal junction ( GEJ ) diaphragm highly variable . In present era minimally invasive antireflux surgery , short esophagus seem originate controversy open debate . Many thousand laparoscopic standard antireflux operation perform world numerous article report satisfactory short medium-term functional result 90 % case , although experience need tailor approach emerge . However , last two three year , many report diagnosis laparoscopic management shorten esophagus GERD surgery publish . The controversy base four fact . 1 . If indication surgical therapy GERD restrict severe , long stand cardial incontinence complication associate hiatus hernia , number patient panmural esophagitis esophageal shorten high percentage indication open also refluxers otherwise treatable intermittent low dosage medical therapy 2 . The clinical-instrumental predictor esophageal elastic fibrotic shortening define current study adopt different evaluation criterion 3 . The perception `` excessive tension '' fundoplication operate table highly subjective . 4 . During process progressive shortening esophagus , portion fundus attract diaphragm may take appearance funnel hardly distinguishable thicken oesophagus . Therefore gastric fundus may erroneously wrap around herniated stomach . Preoperative assessment length esophagus order decide surgical technique adopt controversial . Yau et . demonstrate association esophageal shorten measure standard manometry postoperative para-esophageal herniation , increase risk small . Predictors need esophageal lengthening procedure para-esophageal hernia , Barrett 's esophagus fail antireflux surgery . However preoperative assessment give information degree elasticity fibrosis esophagus . Through laparoscopic surgery , cranially distend diaphragmatic hiatus pneumoperitoneum may artefact increase length intra-abdominal esophagus , impossibility manually palpate feel tension apply esophagus bring GEJ diaphragm may make difficult recognize condition shorten esophagus , experience surgeon adequate . On basis radiological classification use since sixty , later validate radiological-manometric study demonstrate progressive orad migration GEJ associate increase severity cardial incontinence gastro-esophageal reflux . Recent study show permanent orad displacement GEJ across diaphragm infrequent patient affect various grade GERD present 50 % patient undergoing antireflux surgery severe , otherwise manageable GERD . Up 25 % patient may require procedure lengthen esophagus order place fundoplication diaphragm without tension . The missed diagnosis short esophagus consequent inadequacy treatment one major cause failure antireflux surgery . As number antireflux operation , mainly laparoscopic , perform per year remarkably increase , issue so-called short esophagus today one major point management antireflux surgery , deserve reappraisal definitive clarification . The daily clinical practice surgeon dedicate therapy esophageal disease could take advantage definition frequency , preoperative predictor , intraoperative management post operative outcome case foreshorten esophagus order offer patient affect GERD , elements necessary conscious choice therapy , whether medical surgical plan best performance surgical procedure . AIMS OF THE STUDY Principal aim 1 . To define percentage case among total antireflux procedure perform , , standard isolation ge junction eventual dissection mediastinal esophagus least two centimetre esophagus replace without applied tension apex diaphragmatic hiatus . Secondary aim 2 . To define percentage surgical procedure aim treat electively condition non reducible , foreshortened esophagus , among multicentric form case series patient submit antireflux surgery ; 3 . To define preoperative clinical instrumental predictor surgical procedure aim treat foreshorten esophagus ; 4 . To record intra-operative , postoperative , 6 month 12 month outcome procedure adopt surgical treatment GERD ;</detailed_description>
