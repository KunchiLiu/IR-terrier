	<detailed_description>The rationale study compare different type anesthetic maintenance base amount systemic metabolic breakdown low repartion rate within various tissue rapid elimination desflurane respect common inhalation intravenous anesthetic possible factor rate recovery cognitive function appearance post operative delirium . After general anesthesia desflurane less residual hypnotic agent elimination circulation tissue respect amount give propofol sevoflurance ( 1-3 ) . Perioperative cerebral injury correlate surgical intervention anesthesia result decline cognitive function ( 4 ) define entity post operative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) . In study possible distinguish : - Early POCD : attributable anesthesia - Long-Term POCD : could attributable cognition associate advanced age rather procedural effect ( surgery , anesthesia , confinement hospital bed ) The prevalence POCD high patient advanced age ( &gt; 70 ) case general anesthesia use highly invasive surgery ( orthopedic , abdominal thoracic surgery ) ( 5-7 ) . A consensus exist regard test evaluation POCD . In protocol propose use three scale concurrently commonly use evaluation cognitive function . Regarding neuropsychological complication , scope study evaluate prevalence post operative delirium onset 48 hour follow end surgical intervention . Delirium fundamentally consist three basic neuropsychological disorder : - Visual auditory hallucination - Spatial-temporal disorientation - Inappropriate language Post operative delirium entail : - An increase morbidity mortality - An increase risk neurological damage - Significant discomfort patient , family staff ( 6 ) Some condition predispose patient onset post operative delirium : advanced age ( &gt; 70 year old ) , alcohol abuse , abnormalities pre-operative cognitive state , electrolyte chemical imbalance ( Na , K , glucose , etc . ) Protocol After induction anesthesia , carry use routine clinical practice determine anesthesiologist patient assign either control group comparison group ( assignment make prior induction ) . The control group receive either propofol sevoflurance ( without N2O discretion anesthesiologist base clinical need ) . The comparison group give desflurane ( end tidal 5.0 - 6.0 % ) maintenance anesthesia ( without N2O discretion anesthesiologist base clinical need ) . According randomized sequence patient assign consecutive manor maintenance control technique desflurane . The objective study observe difference point recovery cognition , evaluate appropriate test immediate post operative period onset post operative delirium ( visual auditory hallucination , spatial temporal disorientation , inappropriate language ) within 48 hour follow surgery . Normal care use administration benzodiazapam premedication patient high risk develop post operative delirium , use doe represent criterion exclusion study . In addition hypotension avoid ( maintenance mean blood pressure great 70 mmHg ) also intraoperative hyper ventilation ( avoid hypocapnia ) . Every collaborator would initially enroll 10 patient ( 5 control group receive propofol sevoflurance 5 comparison group receive desflurane ) order become confident method protocol evaluation method use measure cognitive function . Every collaborator relevant core study cite list coauthor . The database consist protocol data disposal collaborator scientific work . Statistical Analysis The diagnostic characteristic patient register described accord categorical variable across table frequency . Continuous variable subject summary statistic average , standard deviation , median , minimum maximum . The difference group subject verification significance non-parametric ( Chi Square Fisher Exact Test non-continuous variable Mann-Whitney Kruskall-Wallis association continuous variable . The incidence cardiovascular respiratory complication , nausea and/or vomiting , shiver , neurological complication delirium tabulate table frequency . Criteria Enrollment The study include patient age ASA physical status undergo elective surgery . All patient must Glascow Coma Score ( GCS ) equal 15 intervention must undergo following : - Informed consent anesthesia - Preoperative evaluation include determination ASA physical status GCS Laboratory test - Preoperative evaluation - Routine laboratory test - Treatment test appropriate patient 's condition - ECG - Chest x-ray After induction anesthesia do accord normal routine individual anesthesiologist , patient assign accord randomize sequence one two group : 1a ) Anesthesia propofol ( total intravenous anesthesia - TVA ) 1b ) Anesthesia sevoflurane ( without N2O ) 2 ) Anesthesia desflurane ( without N2O ) The anesthesiologist use agent ( oppiods , _________ , antihypertensives etc . ) accord clinical need judgment anesthesiologist . The type quantity drug use Perioperative period must report anesthesia record . Intra operative monitoring - ECG - Blood pressure ( invasive non-invasive ) - SpO2 - EtCO2 - Et halogenated agent - Urine output Tests Before anesthetize patient give three cognitive test : SOMCT , RLAS MMSE . The test follow ( repeat emergence , 20 , 40 , 60 minute extubation . This permit evaluation level recovery cognition compare value obtain anesthesia obtain three successive administration test wake-up . The Short Orientation Memory Concentration Test ( SOMCT ) investigate patient 's capacity know current year month one two repeat numerical order inverse sequence month year . These variable permit assignment numerical score 0 28 base upon patient 's cognitive function . Higher score indicate well cognitive function ( 12 ) . The Rancho Los Amigos Scale ( RLAS ) scale utilized quantify behavioral cognitive state acute cerebral injury . Each state correspond one eight level ( I - VIII ) . Higher score indicate good state behavior cognition . The Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) test usually administer adult elderly one suspect might memory character disturbance ( 13 ) . This test require use pencil , watch sheet paper . The maximum attainable score 30 . A compiled score 24 - 30 could indicate psychological decline cognitive function little importance . On hand score 24 denote cognitive disturbance much severe score decrease . The Wake-up The start study period coincides suspension hypnotic ( propofol/sevoflurane desflurane ) . At moment time extubation begin discretion anesthesiologist would evaluate patient usual extubation criterion ( respiratory dynamic , ability maintain SpO2 &gt; 95 % , Et CO2 30 - 40 mmHg , muscle strength , presence laryngeal reflex , swallow , etc . ) At point anesthesiologist bring flow fresh gas value great minute ventilation change circuit open system . The time suspension anesthesia extubation record patient 's anesthetic record . In order evaluate memory quickly termination anesthetic ( extubation ) would necessary inform patient correct time day immediate wake period . The patient evaluate accord Aldrete score ( 11 ) 5 minute extubation ane every 5 minute Aldrete score 9-10 obtrained . The patient reach score 9-10 ( capacity move extremities spontaneously command , breath cough , mean blood pressure 20 % preoperative level , arouse capacity maintain SpO2 great 90 % ) begin undergo cognitive testing . At time interval evaluation recovery cognition , patient evaluate ( treat ? ) pain use analogue visual scale ( VAS 0 = pain , 10 = maximum pain imaginable ) . The patient ask information furnish awakening . During period blood pressure , heart rate , ECG , SpO2 measure evaluate cardiovascular , respiratory function , patient evaluate nausea/vomiting , shiver neurological abnormality . Episodes hypotension ( mean blood pressure le 50 mmHg period great 5 minute ) , hypertension ( meant blood pressure great 100 mmHg period great 5 minute ) record treated necessary . At 24 48 hour presence delirium evaluate , particular appearance alteration spatial temporal orientation , auditory visual hallucination inappropriate language , note . Information compile Patient Records General Data This section aim identify researcher classify patient . Information obtain regard patient age , sex , height weight name medical center date intervention . Preoperative data Needed therapy medical condition include cardiac , respiratory , neurologic metabolic problem prior surgery record . Intra-operative data This data record factor related intervention include anesthetic technique utilize , fluid administer , duration anesthesia surgery , type surgery patient 's position . It great importance report episode hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg ) hypertension ( diastolic pressure &gt; 100 mmHg ) protract ( duration longer 5 minute ) . Post operative data This data relate wake patient base three group study . The evaluation wake-up result Aldrete score , SOMCT , RLAS , MMSE accord order specify discription protocol . It important indicate episode protract hypo hypertension episode hypoxia ( SpO2 &lt; 95 % ) well intensity pain use VAS ( treatment ? ) .</detailed_description>
