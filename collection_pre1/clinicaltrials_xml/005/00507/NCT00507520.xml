	<brief_summary>To assess effect almonds coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk factor ( serum lipid , measurement oxidative stress nitric oxide production ) add diet subject high cholesterol . Also , assess whether amount almond consume ( i.e . almond dose ) decrease CHD risk factor dose dependent manner . We hypothesize since almond show reduce serum lipid , believe also increase nitric oxide level relate high level arginine reduce marker oxidative stress relate content bioactive phenolic . We anticipate dose-dependent relationship observe result great reduction risk factor coronary heart disease great dose almond consume .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Almond Dose Response Study .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study show nut , specifically almonds , result improve coronary heart disease ( CHD ) lipid risk profile . Part reason ascribe high content monounsaturated fat . However previous study do , almond supplement , comparison olive oil dairy protein base supplement , still show significant reduction total cholesterol ( total-C ) low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) . We wish use paradigm confirm lipid lower effect almond , establish similar relationship apolipoproteins add support cardiovascular risk reduction associate almond diet . In addition , view relatively high arginine content almond , believe high level nitric oxide ( NO ) produce , indicate increase NO expired air perfuse olfactory mucosa . With technique , find high level NO preliminary study subject soy diet . These data would add interest nut relation cardiovascular disease risk reduction . Furthermore , phenolic present high concentration oil seed nut , know antioxidant activity . As yet , appear emphasize relation almond . We therefore determine effect feed almond measure oxidative stress , include oxidize LDL-C , consider direct relevance CHD ; oxidize DNA , potential importance neoplastic transformation carcinogenesis . These study could lead assessment postprandial effect almonds determine mechanism , study cardiovascular effect almonds include exercise stress test measure vascular reactivity ( e.g . forearm blood flow ) conjunction NO measurement . Protocol : All subject underwent three 4-week treatment randomize crossover trial . Background Diet : Subjects instruct follow National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) Step 2 dietary guideline . Nuts , soy dietary supplement ( vitamin , mineral herbal remedy ) exclude background diet phase study . Treatments : The three phase weight maintain , self-selected diet : control , full almond half almond . Almond : Raw almonds added supplement subject 's usual diet . Subjects calorie need 2,400 kcal great , assess LRC table , receive full almond supplement ( 100 g/d , approximately 600 kcal ) . Subjects require 1,600-2,400 kcal daily receive 75 % full supplement ( 75 g/d , approximately 450 kcal ) . Subjects require less 1,600 kcal daily receive 50 % full supplement ( 50 g/d , approximately 300 kcal ) . Control : The full control supplement four 150 kcal muffin . Control supplement match energy content nut supplement ; i.e . either 600 kcal/d ( 4 muffin ) ; 450 kcal/d ( 3 muffin ) 300 kcal/d ( 2 muffin ) . The macronutrient composition muffin conform NCEP Step 2 diet 25 % total fat , &lt; 7 % saturate fat ( use corn oil oil commonly use healthy baked good ) , 18 % protein ( average subject population use add skim milk powder ) , zero cholesterol . Muffins make wheat flour . Half Portion : The Half Portion match energy content two treatment period . However treatment , half energy derive almonds half control muffins . Design : Randomized crossover design . Duration : The study consist three month subject recruitment selection ; three 4-week treatment period supplement provide , least two-week washout period supplement . ( Total duration : approximately 7.5 month per subject ) . Study Details : Subjects come 12h overnight fast Risk Factor Modification Center St. Michael 's Hospital ( Toronto ) immediately prior commencement study weekly interval course study period . Prior start study , subject instruct detail study diet protocol . They also ask maintain constant level physical activity throughout course study . At visit , body weight ( kg ) obtain indoor clothing , without shoe . Measurements : Bloods take baseline week 2 4 phase . Pulmonary air collect baseline week 4 phase . Diet histories record last week phase . Compliance : Compliance assess complete one-week diet record supplement intake record . Diet record review dietitian subject end week . In addition , uneaten supplement return , weigh note menu plan dietitian .</detailed_description>
