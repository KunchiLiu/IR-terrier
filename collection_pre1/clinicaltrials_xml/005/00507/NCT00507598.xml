	<brief_title>Metabolomics-Based Detection Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , metabolite profile analysis carry colon cancer patient time diagnosis course treatment , use patient tissue serum sample . Samples serum ( 1 ml ) tissue specimen ( 50 mg ) colorectal cancer patient ( stage I-IV ) serum sample equal number age gender-matched healthy control obtain identical ( 8-hour overnight fast ) condition . Metabolic profile identify use NMR MS instrument locate Purdue 's on-campus NMR MS facility . Multivariate statistical analysis use monitor change metabolite profile indicate change disease status . We anticipate putative biomarkers easier identify cancerous tissue , concentration metabolite quantify patient ' serum , ultimately would allow easy detection colon cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients resectable colorectal cancer must sample collect ( serum/urine ) prior surgery and/or surgery , prior start chemotherapy . Patients metastatic colorectal cancer must sample collect prior initiate chemotherapy , chemotherapy initiation : every 3 month 24 month . Subjects must â‰¥ 18 year age . Subjects undergo screen colonoscopy able participate healthy control patient colon polyp colonoscopy identifies colon polyps present ( informed consent sign first sample collect ; colonoscopy sample identify `` healthy '' `` polyp '' ) . For patient underwent biopsy surgery colorectal cancer , enough tissue need available testing , appropriate per patient group protocol Schema . Subjects must able attend follow treatment visit per investigator 's recommendation 24 month collection serum/urine specimen . Female patient know pregnant eligible protocol . Subjects must able undergo 8hr overnight fast prior metabolomic test Presence invasive cancer colorectal cancer exclusion criterion</criteria>
