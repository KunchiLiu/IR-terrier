	<brief_title>Dasatinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 12-week progression-free survival rate objective response rate , measure Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion , patient recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck treat dasatinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define metabolic response rate positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan 0 , 8 , 12 week . II . To define overall survival distribution initiation dasatinib . III . To define duration response . IV . To determine correlation clinical benefit dasatinib ( defined disease response stabilization ) pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics ( phosphorylated Src [ pSrc ] expression platelet ) , change serum level cytokine , growth factor , growth factor receptor relevant Src signal pathway . V. To examine relationship clinical benefit mammary tumor squamous cell carcinoma-associated protein ( EMS1 ) gene amplification cortactin expression level tumor tissue prior therapy modulation cortactin level treatment . VI . To compare effect dasatinib apoptosis terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) assay tumor tissue compare pre- post-treatment biopsy . VII . To assess tolerability dasatinib patient population . VIII . To describe pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile relative bioavailability dasatinib suspension patient receive drug percutaneous gastrostomy tube . IX . To descriptively assess safety , toxicity , efficacy dasatinib crush administered feeding tube . OUTLINE : Patients receive dasatinib orally ( PO ) via percutaneous gastrostomy ( PEG ) tube twice daily ( BID ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 4 week .</detailed_description>
