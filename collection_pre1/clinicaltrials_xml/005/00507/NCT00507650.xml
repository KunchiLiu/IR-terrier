	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether provide extra fluid nursing home resident help prevent heal pressure ulcer . We hypothesize provide extra fluid nursing home resident increase skin blood flow oxygen support heal maintain healthy skin . Participants enrol pressure ulcer at-risk ulcer ( determine look risk factor ) . The study divide two 10 day phase . In Phase 1 , examine participant 's usual status , include fluid intake baseline heal potential . In Phase 2 , participant randomly place group receive either usually prescribe fluid intake additional fluid . A study nurse provide fluid resident . We measure actual intake , body water , well kidney work , potential heal , also monitor development fluid overload . This study important help u understand role basic nursing intervention prevention treatment pressure ulcer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pressure ulcer prevalent nursing home . They heal slowly , cause pain , impair quality life , expensive treat . Dehydration problem nursing home resident under-perfusion problem others . Theoretically , provide supplemental fluid under-hydrated resident increase fluid various fluid compartment body , increase subcutaneous oxygen , support skin integrity , enhance pressure ulcer blood flow pressure ulcer healing , include collagen production . This proposition examine nursing home resident pressure ulcer . The purpose randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) subject serve control determine whether administration supplemental fluid nursing home resident risk pressure ulcer enhance collagen deposition . Specifically , study determine whether oral administration supplemental fluid give daily five day person risk pressure ulcer enhance collagen deposition , increase total body water , augments subcutaneous tissue oxygen , increase pressure ulcer oxygenation , safe . The sample nursing home resident risk pressure ulcer . After consent , baseline measure collagen deposition , pressure ulcer oxygen , fluid intake , body water various fluid compartment measure . Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene ( ePTFE ) tube use measure collagen deposition . Bioelectrical impedance use measure body water . In treatment phase , subject randomize one two supplemental fluid regime . Supplemental fluid administer five day collagen deposition , subcutaneous tissue oxygen , pressure ulcer oxygen , body water various compartment measure . Subjects monitor fluid overload . Data analyze RMANOVA logistic regression technique .</detailed_description>
