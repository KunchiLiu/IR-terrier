	<brief_title>Axillary Lymph Node Status After Completion Preoperative Neoadjuvant Systemic Chemotherapy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple retrospective report verify overall utility post-treatment sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) map biopsy assess final axillary lymph node status breast cancer patient undergone preoperative neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy . However , date , one report , abstract form , currently exist within literature specifically assess utility post-treatment SLN mapping biopsy completion preoperative neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy patient biopsy-proven positive axillary lymph node initial presentation . The purpose present propose clinical trial ass utility SLN mapping biopsy predict final axillary status completion preoperative neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy patient biopsy-proven positive axillary lymph node initial presentation . All eligible patient must biopsy-proven invasive breast cancer must also biopsy-proven involvement axillary lymph node initial presentation . Biopsy-proven involvement axillary lymph node initial presentation base fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) cytology , core/Tru-cut biopsy , pre-treatment SLN biopsy . All eligible patient undergone preoperative neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy . After completion preoperative neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy day definitive breast cancer surgery , patient inject intradermally approximately 400 microcuries Tc-99m sulfur colloid . Patients undergo preoperative lymphoscintigraphy nuclear medicine department access axillary extra-axillary site localization . Intraoperatively , patient also inject approximately 4 5 mL 1 % isosulfan blue dye ( intradermal , intraparenchymal , subareolar route ) . Patients undergo intraoperative identification biopsy SLN candidate . A confirmatory axillary lymph node dissection perform patient . The SLN mapping biopsy procedure propose perform breast cancer patient know positive axillary lymph node initial presentation do identical fashion SLN mapping biopsy procedure currently perform routine acceptable standard care every breast cancer patient clinically negative axilla presentation . The primary endpoint study would address success identification SLN accuracy SLN mapping biopsy procedure woman undergone preoperative neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy biopsy-proven involvement axillary lymph node initial presentation . We would like show proportion woman false negative SLN biopsy result less 10 % . The study require minimum 49 woman newly diagnose breast cancer biopsy-proven involvement axillary lymph node initial presentation undergone preoperative neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy . The study accrual time may take range approximately 24 36 month complete .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients must female 18 year age old . Patients must clinical T1 , T2 , T3 tumor size . Patients must histopathologic tissue diagnosis breast cancer coretype breast biopsy Patients must biopsyproven involvement axillary lymph node initial presentation base fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) cytology , core/Trucut biopsy , pretreatment SLN biopsy require axillary lymph node dissection perform time definitive breast cancer surgery . Patients undergone preoperative neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy . Patients may candidate either lumpectomy mastectomy . Patients may history previously treat metachronous contralateral breast cancer past . Patients may synchronous bilateral breast cancer . Patients must pregnant ( The absence pregnancy must document one following : negative serum pregnancy test , history surgical sterilization , absence menstruation least six month prior enrollment study ) Patients may history previous treat ipsilateral breast cancer past .</criteria>
