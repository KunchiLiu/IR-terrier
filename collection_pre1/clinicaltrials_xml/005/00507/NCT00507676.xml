	<brief_summary>Infants enrol study one three group . First , group full term infant history wheeze . Second , group infant receive ct scan non-respiratory relate . Third , group infant bear full term history wheeze least 3 episode . The three group compare see difference lung function , lung structure lung size . Besides compare test result evaluate environmental inherited characteristic . There 2 purpose study . The first purpose : To determine whether asymptomatic group infant high risk wheezing ( Environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) exposure , Fm Asthma , male Gender ) fix reversible airway narrow . The second purpose study : To determine relative contribution fix reversible airway narrow infant recurrent symptomatic wheezing , determine whether fixed reversible airway narrow related ETS exposure , Fm Asthma , male Gender .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lung Function Structure Healthy Infants Infants With Recurrent Wheezing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among asymptomatic healthy infant decrease airway function find infant expose environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) history family asthma ( Fm Asthma ) , male gender . These infant significantly great risk wheeze infancy . These finding indicate genetic environmental factor affect mechanical determinant airway function among healthy infant variation mechanical determinant contribute increase risk develop airway obstruction severe enough result clinical symptom wheeze . The mechanism reduce airway function risk infant know . In adult reduce airway function result airway narrowing , increase airway compliance , decrease pulmonary elastic recoil . The thought true infant . The cause airway narrow may functional ( reversible bronchodilator ) structural ( fix , reversible bronchodilator ) component . Fixed determinant airway narrow include small absolute airway size , thicken airway wall , decrease elastic recoil , small airway size relative lung volume . Reversible determinant include airway hyper-responsiveness inflammation . Understanding alteration airway function increase risk airway disease decisive development strategy prevention treatment wheeze infant child , hence , reduction morbidity mortality . It know whether infant recurrent wheeze persistent airway narrow acutely symptomatic , whether airway function infant related ETS exposure , Fm Asthma , male gender . When recurrently wheezy infant asymptomatic , airway function may low normal , low airway function may fix reversible bronchodilator . It important determine whether infant functional structural abnormality acutely symptomatic , determine lung structure relate lung function . Only design effective therapeutic intervention recurrently symptomatic infant , well , design early intervention strategy . The Specific aim project : Specific Aim # 1 : To determine whether asymptomatic group infant high risk wheezing ( Environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) exposure , Fm Asthma , male Gender ) fix reversible airway narrow . Specific Aim # 2 : To determine relative contribution fix reversible airway narrow infant recurrent symptomatic wheezing , determine whether fixed reversible airway narrow related ETS exposure , Fm Asthma , male Gender . We propose answer important question lung function structure infant use state art methodology</detailed_description>
