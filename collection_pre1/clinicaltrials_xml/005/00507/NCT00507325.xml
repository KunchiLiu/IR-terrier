	<brief_title>Sample Collection From Melanoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers M. D. Anderson want learn much possible melanoma cancer . One way researcher learn cancer study blood tumor . If agree take part study , way participate depend treat cancer . If receive form chemotherapy , 4 1/2 tablespoon blood drawn start first day treatment . You 3 tablespoon blood drawn every 6 8 week next 6 month . You total 5 blood draw portion study . You blood draws routine visit additional visit require . If receive `` immunologic target '' cancer treatment , blood drawn test . Immunologic treatment kind treatment boost immune system fight cancer . Targeted cancer treatment kind treatment disrupts function protein need tumor growth . About 4 1/2 tablespoon blood drawn start first day treatment . You 3 tablespoon blood drawn 1 time first 2 week ( Days 2-14 ) , 1 time second 2 week ( Days 15-28 ) , 1 time second third month ( Days 29 - 90 ) , every 3 month 5 year . A total 25 sample draw . After 6-month period , follow-up schedule M. D. Anderson , 3 tablespoon blood drawn ( follow-up visit ) every 3 month next 5 year . You total 20 blood draw portion study . During follow-up , routine clinic visit monitor tumor recurrence ( occur ) . You continue visit every 2 6 month , depend risk tumor recurrence . If receiving form cancer treatment , 4 1/2 tablespoon blood draw day enroll study . If agree ( choice ) participate follow-up portion study , 3 tablespoon blood drawn ( follow-up visit ) every 3 month next 5 year . You total 21 blood draw portion study . If agree take part additional follow-up , participation study . If planning surgery remove tumor part standard care , tumor sample collect time store secure confidential laboratory M. D. Anderson . If tumor sample small , whole tumor sample send doctor diagnostic evaluation . If case , researcher use tumor sample study . If tumor like skin lesion lymph node lesion locate close skin , plan cancer treatment , sample tumor collect receive cancer treatment . It also collect 2 time ( study 's research ) , treatment . A total number biopsy exceed 6 per year , exceed 10 5 year period . The biopsy perform use small needle ( without ultrasound image machine ) , punch knife , small surgery . If tumor locate close skin plan receive cancer treatment , ask tumor biopsy 2 time per year 5 year . Before blood tumor sample use research , people research must get specific approval institutional review board ( IRB ) M. D. Anderson . The IRB committee make doctor , researcher , member community . The IRB responsible protect participant involve research study make sure research do safe ethical manner . All research do M. D. Anderson , include research involve blood and/or tumor sample bank , must first approve IRB . This investigational study . Up 200 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
