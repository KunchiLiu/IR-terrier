	<brief_summary>This study examine whether drug cetrorelex acetate ( Cetrotide [ Registed Trademark ] ) protect ovarian function woman undergo chemotherapy . Some cancer treatment know cause change woman 's period cause menstruation stop completely , become pregnant . Cetrorelex acetate use many year low hormone level stop period patient undergo vitro fertilization treatment . This study see make ovary inactive may protect affect certain cancer drug , thus preserve fertility . Women age 21who begin menstruating , uterus least one functioning ovary , undergoing chemotherapy cyclophosphamide , busulfan , nitrogen mustard L-phenalanin mustard may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure 24-month study : Baseline evaluation - Medical history , physical examination blood urine test - Questionnaire quality life , menstrual period , vaginal bleeding desire future fertility - 3D ultrasound abdomen - DEXA scan evaluate bone density Assignment treatment : - Lo ovral ( contraceptive pill prevent pregnancy control menstrual period ) alone , - Lo ovral study drug cetrorelex acetate , give injection skin day six menstrual cycle Evaluations - Transvaginal 3D ultrasound monitor change ovary - 6 month cetrorelex acetate injection - DEXA scan - 6 month cetrorelex acetate injection - Blood test safety monitoring , pregnancy testing , endocrine test research use - every 3 month first year , every 6 month second year - Questionnaire monitor change quality life - every 3 month first year , every 6 month second year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Cetrorelex Acetate Ovarian Function Women Undergoing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As result inability female germ cell regenerate injury , number chemotherapeutic agent induce premature ovarian failure majority reproductive age woman receive . The long-term survival woman increase effective chemotherapy , make iatrogenic ovarian failure infertility increasingly significant issue . Currently choices maintain fertility include vitro fertilization ( IVF ) embryo cryopreservation , oocyte cryopreservation use GnRH agonist antagonist preserve ovarian function . Much evidence use GnRH agonist prevent premature ovarian failure find systemic lupus erythematosus literature . Blumenfeld colleague publish report demonstrate preservation ovarian function 100 % patient treat leuprolide acetate prior cyclophosphamide therapy , compare 50 % ovarian failure rate patient receive leuprolide acetate . Although result animal study human study encourage , adequately control trial need . Future trial need sufficient number patient , receive multiple type chemotherapeutic agent adequately document utility medical prophylaxis . The experience ovulation induction suggest GnRH antagonist may similar efficacy GnRH agonists . GnRH antagonists compete directly GnRH receptor binding , result antagonist rapidly inhibit secretion gonadotropin sex steroid . Unlike GnRH agonist , GnRH antagonists immediate effect antagonist give independent menstrual cycle day . These difference represent several practical benefit offer antagonist . In recent case series Sauer et al , cetrorelix acetate , GnRH antagonist , give dos 3mg four day interval four patient age 21-30 . Menses preserve four patient one spontaneous conception . Because potential advantage use GnRH antagonist compare agonist , cetrorelix acetate study placebo investigation . Our specific aim compare rate ovarian preservation reproductive age woman receive chemotherapeutic agent know affect ovarian function receive Cetrorelix acetate co treatment woman receive agent receive Cetrorelix acetate . A second aim evaluate ability Cetrorelix acetate co treatment induce therapeutic amenorrhea study population risk thrombocytopenia associate heavy vaginal bleeding .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All reproductive age woman menarche age 21 , undergo chemotherapy agent know affect ovarian function follicle stimulate hormone level ( FSH ) less 20 mIU/L offer enrollment .
