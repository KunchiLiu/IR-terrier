To apply nutritional assessment tool early detection patient risk malnutrition . 2 . To examine feasibility conduct intervention study . 3 . To describe cancer-related fatigue pattern among BMT patient multiple time point ambulatory visit . 4 .

	<brief_title>Nutritional Assessment Intervention Improve Cancer-Related Fatigue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recipients allogeneic BMT often experience fatigue side effect due several factor , include high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy well stress everyday activity increase fatigue . In addition , transplantation , patient 's ability maintain regular nutritional need ( usually due unique diet require help increase marrow function ) affect , increase fatigue level . Researchers want use information learn study find nutritional intervention help decrease fatigue level increase caloric intake . Participating study involve routine visit M. D. Anderson ambulatory treatment center . Before start study , ask allergy may . You also ask question caregiver , many caregiver , whether caregiver able attend nutrition class , whether caregiver record food intake information . You ask question help study researcher decide eligible take part study . It take 30 minute collect data . Your caregiver present data collect . You ask fill questionnaire medical history , personal demographic ( name , age , race , gender ) , fatigue level . These questionnaire take less 1 hour complete . The study researcher collect questionnaires put envelope code ID number front cover , instead name personal information . A dietitian set-up appointment ( within 3 day first visit ambulatory clinic ) baseline test call indirect calorimetry . This test perform treatment room ambulatory treatment clinic find many calorie need daily basis . For test , ask sit quietly treatment room breathe mouth piece nose clip nose 10 minute . This test use machine collect air breathe ( inhalation ) ( exhalation ) . The machine use information breathe calculate many calorie need intake day . This entire process take 1 hour complete . You give recommended level dietary caloric intake schedule study activity within first week enrol study . After test , randomize ( toss coin ) group . There 2 group study . There 6 participant group . If find eligible agree take part study , ask draw seal envelope bag , show study group . You allow draw 1 envelope bag . You equal chance assign either group . Participants 1 group give standard care ( next 42 day ) allogeneic BMT ambulatory center . Participants group give standard care ( next 45 day ) allogeneic BMT ambulatory center well nutritional assessment intervention . If envelope label say `` standard , '' receive standard care . If envelope label say `` intervention , '' receive standard care well nutritional assessment intervention . During first week study , caregiver receive training dietitian put information food record , include name amount kind food drink intake time get bed time go bed . On Days 7 , 21 , 35 ( Weeks 1 , 3 , 5 ) , study researcher remind caregiver start food record give record sheet . You turn 3 daily food record specify week . If day ambulatory center visit week , study researcher would like complete one-day food record day part 3 daily record . If different caregiver one week , dietitian train new caregiver record food drink day . The study researcher collect food record give fatigue questionnaire Days 14 , 28 , 42 . It take 30 minute complete . If schedule clinic visit specify day , study researcher meet first visit follow date . If standard care group , receive indirect calorimetry test beginning study , submit 3-day food record every 2 week . You receive result food record . Your health care provider may refer see dietitian time study part standard care . If time caloric intake consider 50 % le expected intake , regular doctor notify . If intervention group , result food record give dietitian within 3 day collection food record ( Days 17 , 31 , 45 ) . You receive result person dietitian consultant . You able discus issue relate food intake ( food choice , food option , problem related meal preparation , increase calorie nutrient ) might able bring caloric intake good level . You take study develop condition call gastrointestinal graft versus host disease , major organ failure ( heart , kidney , liver ) , intolerable side effect standard care treatment . This investigational study . Up 12 patient take part pilot study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
