	<criteria>Male female 18 year age old Not candidate highdose chemotherapy stem cell transplantation ( HDT/SCT ) due age , presence important comorbid condition ( ) likely negative impact tolerability HDTSCT , subject preference . A Karnofsky Performance Status score ≥50 % Symptomatic multiple myeloma asymptomatic multiple myeloma relate organ tissue damage . Asymptomatic multiple myelomarelated organ tissue damage include presence asymptomatic lytic bone lesion plasmacytoma , presence anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL ) , renal function impairment ( serum creatinine &gt; upper limit normal [ ULN ] ) hypercalcemia ( serum calcium &gt; ULN ) . Must measurable disease require systemic therapy . Measurable disease define least 1 follow criterion : Quantifiable serum Mprotein value ( &gt; 1 g/dL immunoglobulin ( Ig ) G IgM Mprotein , &gt; 0.5g/dL IgA Mprotein , &gt; 0.5 g/dL IgD Mprotein ) Urine lightchain excretion ≥200 mg/24 hour Voluntary write informed consent must give performance study relate procedure part normal medical care , understand consent may withdraw participant time without prejudice future medical care . Diagnosis smolder multiple myeloma monoclonal gammopathy undetermined significance ( MGUS ) . Smoldering multiple myeloma define asymptomatic multiple myeloma absence lytic bone lesion . MGUS define presence serum monoclonal protein &lt; 3 g/dL ; absence lytic bone lesion , anemia , hypercalcemia , renal insufficiency relate monoclonal protein ; ( determine ) proportion plasma cell bone marrow 10 % less . Diagnosis Waldenström 's disease condition immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) Mprotein present absence clonal plasma cell infiltration lytic bone lesion . Previously currently treat systemic therapy multiple myeloma . Prior treatment hypercalcemia spinal cord compression corticosteroid radiation therapy , respectively , disqualify subject ( dose corticosteroid exceed equivalent 160 mg dexamethasone 2week period ) . Radiation therapy within 2 week randomization . Enrollment patient require concurrent radiotherapy ( must localize field size ) defer radiotherapy complete 2 week elapse since last date therapy . Major surgery within 30 day randomization ( Kyphoplasty consider major surgery ) History allergy study medication , analogue , excipients various formulation ≥Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy clinical examination within 21 day enrollment . Any following clinical laboratory value within 21 day prior enrollment : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 1000 cells/mm^3 Platelets &lt; 100,000 × 10^9/L , &lt; 70 × 10^9/L thrombocytopenia consider investigator due myeloma infiltration bone marrow Aspartate aminotransferase [ serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ] ( AST [ SGOT ] ) alanine aminotransferase [ serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase ] ( ALT [ SGPT ] ) &gt; 2× upper limit normal ( ULN ) Serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dL ( &gt; 176.8 µmol/L ) ; rise creatinine relate myeloma demonstrate response hydration , subject may enrol .
