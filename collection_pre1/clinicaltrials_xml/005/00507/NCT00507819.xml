	<brief_summary>In study , investigator evaluate effect sildenafil exercise tolerance patient single cardiac ventricle undergone Fontan operation . The investigator also evaluate echocardiographic measure ventricular function measure quality life change use two validated quality life measure . The hypothesis sildenafil result increase exercise tolerance patient Fontan operation compare placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sildenafil After Fontan Operation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Fontan physiology end result stag reconstruction heart major blood vessel patient single ventricle . After completion reconstruction , great vein usually bring blood back heart connect directly pulmonary artery , allow blood body bypass heart flow directly lung . In system , blood flow lung passive ( pump ) efficiency flow cardiovascular system relate resistance blood flow vessel lung . There two potential problem arise scenario , result resistance blood flow vessel lung . First , amount blood flow return heart lung may sufficient allow heart function maximum efficiency , compromise heart 's ability keep demand body . Second , resistance blood flow lung high , pressure may transmit back great vein secondarily organs body cause mild , sometimes significant , organ dysfunction . Not patient Fontan physiology develop problem , know even patient without obvious problem , ability keep increase metabolic demand , exercise , compromise . Improving efficiency blood flow lung improve return blood heart thereby diminish pressure transmit back vessel passively deliver blood lung . We believe change may manifest diminish symptoms patient know difficulty , may allow increased ability walk , run , participate sport without overt symptom . Most importantly , speculate improve efficiency flow lung , result improved cardiac output ( blood flow body ) make patient energetic make feel good . Sildenafil oral medication use treat patient pulmonary hypertension , disease abnormally elevated pressure vessel lung . In disease , resistance lung abnormally high , severely limit ability heart keep demand body . Sildenafil lower resistance vessel lung show improve exercise performance patient disease . We believe Sildenafil may similar benefit patient Fontan operation cardiac output also limit resistance blood vessel lung . In study , compare exercise capacity , echocardiographic measure cardiac function , overall quality life patient Fontan six-week period sildenafil administration . As control , group patient take placebo six-week period , also test . We hypothesize oral sildenafil result significant improvement exercise capacity , energy level , echocardiographic measure cardiac function output study participant . We hopeful finding investigation directly help child young adult Fontan physiology .</detailed_description>
