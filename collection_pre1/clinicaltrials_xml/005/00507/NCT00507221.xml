	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND : BACKGROUND , SIGNIFICANCE AND RATIONALE • Epidemiology HIV-1 helminth infection Africa : Over two third HIV-1 infected individual live Africa . An expected 4 million new infection occur year Africa alone . While antiretroviral therapy ( ARTs ) offer hope stem tremendous public health disaster , reality many individual able access ARTs . In addition , million HIV infect individual yet qualify ART base clinical immunologic stag criterion . Alternative care strategy delay immunosuppression reduce infectivity critically need . Treatment co-infections prevalent area high HIV-1 sero-prevalence may one strategy address need . Helminths represent common infection human throughout world . It estimate half individual live Sub-Saharan Africa infect least specie soil transmit helminth . Distribution map HIV-1 sero-prevalence helminth infection prevalence reveal remarkably geographic similarity . We recently conduct large study helminth infection among HIV-1 infect adult several site Kenya . While rate helminth co-infection high Kilifi Nyanza sit , significant rate co-infection even within great Nairobi area . We also determine hookworm common helminth identify cohort , type helminth infection vary significantly location . • Immunology helminth co-infection : Helminth infection show profound effect immune system . Chronic helminth infection lead dominant Th2 immune profile , anergy various antigen , significant activation immune system . These change suggest helminth co-infection may significantly affect host immune response HIV-1 viral replication control . Such immune dysregulation may also increase HIV co-receptor expression result cell population susceptible HIV infection . • Th1/Th2 Immune Bias : An important immunologic consequence helminth infection polarization immune response TH2 subset . This immune modulation helminth specie appear important temper TH1 cell mediate inflammation subsequent tissue damage host . Such modulation may detrimental HIV-1 infected host limit Th1 immune response may important control HIV-1 replication . The TH2/TH1 response infection directly influence parasite biology . Helminth infection result specific nematode-elicited macrophage ( NeMacs ) directly induce naïve T cell differentiate Th2 cell . Cytokine mimic produce parasite also able directly induce Th2 cell . Other non-protein molecule produce helminth able interact dendritic cell induce Th2 cell Treg cell produce IL-10 directly lead Th2 shift naïve T cell . In addition inducer Th2 cell , evidence helminth infection directly suppress Th1 response . This reduction Th1 cytokine response accompany reduction virus specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL 's ) . Plasma HIV-1 viral load directly relate HIV-1 specific CTL response human reduction CTL response associate rapid progression HIV-1 disease . • Immune Activation : Individuals reside Africa display high level immune activation . Initial study Ethiopian immigrant Israel reveal elevated level plasma IgE IgG well increase level eosinophilia strongly associate presence helminth infection population . These individual also find significantly activate CD4 lymphocytes correlate reduced total CD4 number cohort . Several author suggest increased activation may important pathogenesis HIV-1 infection . The uncontrolled T cell destruction characteristic HIV infection due direct cytopathic effect virus likely result activation-induced cell death . Immune activation marker ( namely HLA-DR , Ki-67 CD38 ) show predictive CD4 decline plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load . Treatment helminth infection result reversal activate immune state . Helminth co-infection clinical HIV-1 disease progression resource constrain setting • Effect treatment HIV-1 RNA : Plasma HIV-1 RNA level correlate closely burden helminth infection measure number excrete egg per gram stool ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . In cohort , anti-helminth therapy lead clearance helminth eggs stool lead significant decrease HIV-1 plasma viral load ( -0.36 log10 ) cohort . While effect may appear modest , mathematical modeling suggest 0.5 log reduction HIV-1 RNA level would slow onset AIDS 3.5 year would delay need antiretroviral medication almost full year . To date , one randomize control trial conduct evaluate effect treat helminths marker HIV-1 progression . In small unblinded study conduct Zimbabwe , individual schistosomiasis ( without HIV-1 infection ) randomize receive praziquantel inclusion delay 3 month . The study find HIV-1 infected individual receive early treatment schistosomiasis change plasma HIV-1 RNA level compare increase HIV-1 RNA level delay treatment group . However , several observational study evaluate effect treat helminth co-infection find successful eradication helminth effect plasma HIV-1 RNA level even lead transient increase viral load . We currently conduct systematic review Cochrane Library evaluate available data examine effect treat helminth HIV-1 RNA level CD4 count . - Effect treatment CD4 count : Studies evaluate change CD4 count follow therapy helminth co-infection largely fail find significant difference . The randomized controlled trial note find patient treat helminths early treatment group ( HIV seropositive seronegative ) increase absolute CD4 count compare change CD4 count delayed treatment group ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Another study conduct Ethiopia find treatment helminth infection population co-infected individual result significant increase absolute CD4 count ( 192 versus 279 cells/mm3 , p = 0.002 ) . Other study show significant difference CD4 decline follow anti-helminth treatment . The systematic review currently preparation find trend towards effect CD4 count available study though included study short duration ( 4 month less ) . • Justification Study : It important determine empiric deworming beneficial million pre-HAART HIV-1 positive individual live helminth endemic area . Documenting potential effect intervention marker disease progression serve inform practical approach cost-effective intervention resource limit setting . Interval anti-helminth therapy may feasible option many area world delay immunosuppression , enhance response antiretroviral therapy reduce infectiousness HIV-1 infected individual . In addition , patient progress HAART , important determine ideal time helminth eradication . • Hypothesis : An empiric intensive treatment regimen eliminate helminths patient HIV-1 may impact marker disease progression , namely CD4 count plasma HIV-1 RNA level , compare current standard practice Kenya . • Overall General Objectives : To evaluate effect empiric intensive helminth eradication regimen HIV-1 disease progression cohort HIV-1 infect Kenyan adult meet criterion highly active antiretroviral therapy . • Specific Objectives : 1 . To evaluate effect intensive , empiric deworming regimen change marker HIV-1 disease progression , namely time ART eligibility time CD4 count less 200 less 350 cells/mm3 cohort HIV-1 infect adult Kenyans meeting criterion antiretrovirals . 2 . To determine intensive treatment intestinal helminth HIV-1 infect adult reduce marker clinical disease progression measure WHO stag criterion , hospitalization death . DESIGNS AND METHODOLOGY • Study Site : The study conduct several HIV care sit Kenya . The University Washington history collaborative research Kenya Medical Research Institute , University Nairobi , Kenyatta National Hospital ; lead academic institution Kenya . Enrollment randomize clinical trial take place three site Kenya . The determination site base ongoing study helminth prevalence Kenya ( Walson JL , Otieno P , ongoing ) may include AMREF/CDC Clinic Kibera , KNH Comprehensive Care Clinic , KEMRI CCC , Homa Bay District Hospital , Kisii District Hospital , Kisumu District Hospital , Kerugoya District Hospital , Machakos District Hospital , Mbagathi District Hospital , Thika District Hospital , The Comprehensive Care Research Clinic Kilifi District Hospital ( CGMR-C ) . - Study Populations : Individuals 18 year old , currently antiretroviral therapy interested study participation enrol write informed consent obtain . • Sample Size : Sample size determination - Assuming power 90 % alpha 0.05 , calculate 340 individual would need arm detect difference CD4 decline 50 cells/mm3 two group ( SD 200 cells/mm3 ) two year follow . Given maximum expected loss follow approximately 20 % 24 month follow maximum 20 % begin ARV therapy , enroll 1200 individual trial ensure 340 individual available arm analysis . This sample size also provide great 90 % power detect 0.5 log difference log10 HIV RNA level treatment arm . - Study design : Specific Aim 1 : randomize clinical trial Specific Aim 2 : randomize clinical trial - Procedures : Summary : We propose prospective , randomize , control trial intensive deworming care package versus standard care cohort HIV-1 seropositive adult yet meet criterion antiretroviral medication . Participants randomize one two treatment arm . Arm 1 receive intensive regimen anti-helminthic therapy consist albendazole every three month two year praziquantel enrollment one year follow . Arm 2 receive symptomatic diagnosis treatment helminth infection current standard care Kenya . The primary objective study evaluate change CD4 count HIV-1 RNA two year follow study arm . Adult men woman participate refer HIV Care Treatment Clinics include site offer screen eligibility . HIV-1 seropositive individual document CD4 count great 350 cells/mm3 consider potentially eligible . Those agree participate , willing able provide inform consent , WHO stage I II base clinical exam history , 18 year age old , treat worm medication previous 4 month pregnant ( base urine beta-HCG test female ) offer participate trial . Pregnancy test perform study visit ( every three month ) premenopausal woman . Women become pregnant course study continue follow receive study medication pregnancy randomize study arm A . - Clinical Trial : Screening trial eligibility : At select clinical trial study site , HIV-1 infect individual meet inclusion exclusion criterion inform ongoing study . A physical examination conduct prospective client , find clinical pallor sign WHO Stage III IV HIV exclude study refer appropriate medical management . Those meet criterion wish participate refer study staff possible enrollment . All invited participant require sign write informed consent prior enrollment . At enrollment , participant complete standardize questionnaire assess medical social history undergo complete physical examination . Blood specimen collect full blood count differential measurement absolute CD4 count HIV-1 RNA level . A detailed questionnaire also administer order ass socio-economic status , live condition , level education complete occupation . This questionnaire also document potential exposure helminth infection water supply , sanitation facility , exposure large body water type foot cover use . In addition , detailed clinical history also collect document prior illness treatment relevant HIV-1 co-infections . Detailed information regard location participant 's current residence additional residence consider primary dwelling also collect field worker site . Global positioning system information collect location participant site primary residence facilitate patient trace . This information store well potential contact information available ( cell phone number ) order participant may trace purpose study . After sign informed consent enrol , participant randomize one two treatment arm . The study biostatistician generate block randomization code site . Both investigator participant remain blinded study arm allocation randomization occur . All enrol participant schedule study visit every third month 24 month ( enrollment , month 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 24 ) clinic enrol . At follow visit , standardized questionnaire design assess change socio-demographic variable clinical history perform . A physical examination also perform visit . Blood collect enrollment , month 6 , 12 , 18 24 measurement full blood count differential CD4 count . Measurement HIV-1 RNA collect enrollment , 12 month visit 24 month visit . All blood separate plasma PBMC 's ( peripheral blood mononuclear cell ) store future study . Any future study utilize store specimen obtain approval Kenya Medical Research Institute University Washington Ethical Review Boards . All participant provide single stool sample final 24 month follow visit determine helminth infection status time . • Rationale screen stool sample visit : Participants screen helminth infection enrollment course study . The test helminth infection status occur final visit . The rationale design principally due study objective . The study design ass potential benefit empiric helminth therapy HIV-1 infect individual 's yet meet criterion initiation antiretroviral medication . As , important determine HIV infect individual area moderate helminth prevalence ( 20-40 % ) would benefit program empiric deworming part pre-HAART care package . It critical participant enrol regardless helminth infection status order determine empiric therapy consider useful addition care package currently provide individual . Storage stool sample evaluation helminth status follow completion study also feasible several reason . Most importantly , ethical issue relate collection sample ( therefore potential knowledge infection status ) without provide directed therapy . If helminth status know ( potentially know ) , standard care Kenya would change symptomatic screening treatment definitive pathogen direct therapy . This would alter intervention arm current study . In addition , common helminth site sample previous study hookworm . Hookworm egg fragile rapidly degrade . None currently available technique preserve hookworm egg reliably delay evaluation helminth infection status likely miss many infection therefore provide additional useful information . • Laboratory : Between ten twenty millilitre blood draw visit laboratory investigation conduct ( month 0 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 ) . This quantity blood drawn follow assay : 1 . CD4 measurement ( 5 mL ) assess FACSCount FACSCalibur individual study site KEMRI/University Washington Flow Laboratory Centre Clinical Research Nairobi , Kenya . 2 . Full Blood Counts Differential ( 2 mL ) assess individual study site . 3 . Stool microscopy perform technician train certification differentiation quantification stool helminth specie . Stool prepared examination wet preparation , Kato-Katz technique formol-ether concentration . Both qualitative quantitative diagnosis make helminth identify stool . 4 . Circulating Anodic Antigen ( CAA ) ( 3 mL ) assess Centre Clinical Research , KEMRI . 5 . HIV-1 RNA level ( 10 mL ) quantify Kenya Medical Research Institute/Centers Disease Control , Kenya . • Data Management Analysis : This study carry several clinical site Kenya .

The study review Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) University Washington Ethical Review Board ( ERC ) Kenya Medical Research Institute ( KEMRI ) . The study recruit subject prior approval University Washington IRB KEMRI ERC . - Risks : Patients informed potential risk . The propose study involve adult men woman infect HIV-1 . All participant interview . Participants may experience discomfort answer question regard socio-economic status . Participants may also uncomfortable discuss provide stool sample helminth screening . Study staff include social worker and/or peer counselor may contact participant telephone visit participant home schedule appointment miss . These visit conduct manner design protect confidentiality impossible completely eliminate risk social stigmatization participant . This study involve serial blood specimen collection 5 time point two year period ( enrollment month 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 ) . The collection sample involve venipuncture may cause discomfort , pain bruising . Precautions take avoid bleed immediate application pack pressure injection site . All participant provide write informed consent prior screen enrollment . Any adverse event associate anti-helminthic medication manage appropriate clinic site , necessary , hospitalization . The cost care borne study . All clinical information include HIV status collect purpose study delinked client 's identifier . This include data collect clinic laboratory . All data enter password protect computer link identifier . The code link individual patient identifier unique study ID keep securely lock separate location control study principal investigator . All study file accessible researcher store locked office use . There may risk associate use study medication , albendazole praziquantel : Albendazole benzimidazole carbamate derivative activity nematode worm . Albendazole think inhibit cytoplasmic microtubule worm 's intestinal tract lead decrease glucose uptake depletion glycogen store worm . Three 400 mg dos albendazole efficacy whipworm , hookworm roundworm infection , expect prevalent cohort . A recent randomized control trial various albendazole dosing regimen show single 400mg dose albendazole associate significantly low rate cure ( 23 % ) compare three day regimen ( 67 % ) . In study , reduction number eggs/gm feces single 400mg dose 96.8 % compare 99.7 % three day regimen . Albendazole minimally absorb gastrointestinal tract minimal side-effects . Praziquantel heterocyclic prazino-isoquinoline derivative significant activity cestode trematode . Praziquantel highly effective schistosome human confirm case resistance report . Praziquantel well tolerate severe adverse reaction rare . There rare case increase intracranial pressure treatment patient neurocysticercosis . This anticipated issue Kenya due low level pork consumption population rarity Taenia solium . In study describe , screened 1600 individual helminth document case Taenia solium ( Walson J , unpublished data ) . Praziquantel contraindicate pregnancy female patient undergo urine beta-HCG test prior administration . Pregnant breast feed woman receive praziquantel . Patients obvious clinical sign symptom anaemia , significant diarrhoea abdominal pain enrol . Neither routine screening asymptomatic helminth infection empiric anti-helminth therapy currently conduct adult Kenya . • Confidentiality : Patients assign study number enrollment . This number use identify patient matter related data analysis . The form link patient name demographic information particular ID number keep lock file office Fellow Investigator . • Expected application result : We anticipate propose study help determine role common helminth co-infections play HIV-1 pathogenesis progression .
