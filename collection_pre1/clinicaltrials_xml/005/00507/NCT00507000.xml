	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis vitamin D deficiency important public health problem India . In recently publish study center , 90 % apparently healthy subject Delhi classify either vitamin D insufficient deficient use serum 25 ( OH ) D cut level 20 ng/ml 32 ng/ml respectively . Before advent effective antitubercular therapy , patient tuberculosis advised treatment rest sanatorium sunshine available plenty . In western literature , report associate vitamin D deficiency tuberculosis term incidence beneficial response follow addition vitamin D antitubercular therapy . A pilot study show sputum conversion rate high patient tuberculosis supplement vitamin D. In context mechanism link vitamin D deficiency effect tuberculosis currently investigation . In order understand link two type study conduct ( ) clinical study associate vitamin D deficiency tuberculosis ( b ) in-vitro assessment molecular immune change relate vitamin D exposure . With currently available knowledge , linkage two disorder explain broad role vitamin D deficiency modulation cell-mediated immunity . Patients military tuberculosis characterize decreased level Th1 cytokine increase level IL-10 compare healthy infect noninfected control . Current literature suggest long-term control M. tuberculosis infection associate elevate Th1 response concomitant inhibition Th2 response Peripheral blood mononuclear cell show express vitamin D receptor . Incubation macro¬phages physio¬logical concentration 1,25 ( OH ) D [ 10-9M ] result inhibition intracellular growth Mycobacterium tuberculosis . 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol , significant immunomodulatory effect lead ( ) shift cytokine profile T-helper ( Th1 Th2 ) ( b ) reduce antigen presentation , reduce production Th1-promoting cytokine , reduce expression co-stimulatory molecule antigen-presenting cell . In addition , demonstrate addition vitamin D3 derivatives inhibits differentiation IFN-gamma-producing Th1 cell augment differentiation IL-4- IL-10-producing Th2 cell . There systematic data country assess association vitamin D deficiency tuberculosis possible role vitamin D related modulation tuberculosis specific cellular immune response . The present study plan follow hypothesis Hypothesis : Patients pulmonary tuberculosis vitamin D deficiency treat vitamin antitubercular therapy likely show early sputum conversion immune response favor resolution tuberculosis</detailed_description>
