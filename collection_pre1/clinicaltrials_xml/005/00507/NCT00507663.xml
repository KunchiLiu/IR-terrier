	<brief_summary>This study propose prospective randomize study elder undergo elective major abdominal surgery assess recovery follow unique anesthetic regimen incorporate adrenergic receptor antagonist . The purpose study : 1. determine use atenolol , beta-blocker drug commonly use treat high blood pressure heart disease , part anesthetic regimen decrease complication sometimes occur elderly patient undergo surgery give anesthesia . 2. see improves quicken recovery anesthesia surgery . 3. help investigator design good way administer anesthesia surgery , especially elderly patient , complication time recover surgery anesthesia decrease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Elder Surgery - Functional Recovery Following Beta Blockade</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing number age patient multiple chronic disease undergo major surgery . In first third last century , surgery consider desperate measure patient great 50 year age felt incapable sustain rigor inguinal hernia repair . Advances anesthesia last century allow surgeon develop extraordinary array procedure excellent outcomes . Over 5.5 million patient age 60 major procedure 1994 . Centenarians routinely undergo surgical procedure . Notwithstanding enthusiasm surgical treatment , morbidity , mortality , recovery time elderly patient still substantially great young patient . Some morbidity , postoperative delirium cognitive dysfunction appear predominantly affect elderly patient . In previous study , Dr. Valerie Lawrence , co-investigator proposal , demonstrate recovery major surgery , measure ability accomplish standard activity daily live , take average 6 week complicate instrumental activity daily live take average 3 month return baseline elderly surgical patient . These data profound implication initiative control length hospital stay , utilization resource cost care . Evidence suggest family member require extra time work care family member discharge earlier hospital . Published report preliminary data support notion intraoperative administration adrenergic receptor antagonist ( blocker ) improve functional recovery follow surgery general anesthesia . There value target functional status elder undergo surgery , direct relationship functional status utilization health resource . Maximizing postoperative recovery , oppose minimize morbidity mortality , associate surgical intervention elderly consistent goal prolong `` active life expectancy '' expound Healthy People 2002 .</detailed_description>
