	<brief_summary>Standard treatment patient acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction consist acute re-opening occlude coronary artery ( primary PCI ) . Despite successful treatment epicardial vessel reperfusion sometimes inadequate lead large final infarct size . This phenomenon know reperfusion injury . Several animal study indicate graded re-opening artery may limit tissue damage . Generally referred mechanical postconditioning . The study investigate effect final infarct size evaluate magnetic resonance scan postconditioning ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction . Mechanical postconditioning perform mean several balloon inflation injure vessel follow acute re-opening .</brief_summary>
