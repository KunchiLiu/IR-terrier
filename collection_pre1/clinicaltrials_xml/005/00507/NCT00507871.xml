	<brief_summary>Cryptosporidium intestinal parasite cause diarrhea child adult . In addition infection stomach , parasite infect respiratory system cause cough and/or problem breathe . This study enroll 480 child age 9 36 month come Mulago Hospital treatment diarrhea . Researchers believe large number child diarrhea cough parasite present sputum ( mucus cough ) . Researchers also believe child respiratory tract cryptosporidiosis may cough , increased number breath per minute , and/or low oxygen level . Blood , stool , saliva , sputum sample collect child study test Cryptosporidium . Children young provide sputum sample tube place collect mucus sample lung . Study participation may short 4 hour long 2 day depend child 's health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transmission Respiratory Tract Cryptosporidiosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cryptosporidiosis recognize major cause diarrhea worldwide . In addition infection gastrointestinal tract associate fecal-oral transmission , evidence Cryptosporidium infect respiratory tract . Of particular interest numerous report indicate respiratory symptom occur considerable frequency subject intestinal cryptosporidiosis although etiology respiratory symptom never investigate . The association respiratory symptom intestinal cryptosporidiosis particularly strong child questionable nutritional status . This study evaluate prevalence clinical presentation respiratory cryptosporidiosis among child diarrhea Mulago Hospital , Kampala , Uganda . The study screen approximately 1536 child age 9-36 month present Acute Care Unit Mulago Hospital Kampala , Uganda , acute persistent diarrhea . Based result fecal testing , 480 child actively select undergo sample collection 2 group . Group 1 comprise child Cryptosporidium-positive stool , approximately 50 % expect cough ( n=384 ) . Group 2 comprise child Cryptosporidium-negative stool cough ( n=96 ) . The primary objective study : establish prevalence cough child diarrhea due Cryptosporidium infection ; establish prevalence respiratory tract cryptosporidiosis child diarrhea due Cryptosporidium infection ; establish prevalence respiratory tract cryptosporidiosis child diarrhea due cause ; determine whether respiratory Cryptosporidium infection child associate increased respiratory rate decrease oxygen saturation level . To address objective , study focus whether Cryptosporidium oocysts recover induced sputum subject acute persistent diarrhea concurrently experience cough unexplained tachypnea hypoxemia . The primary clinical measure include : duration diarrhea ( day ) ; presence duration cough ( day ) ; respiratory rate presentation dehydrate , rehydration ; oxygen saturation ( measure pulse oximetry ) presentation ; oxygen therapy requirement oxygen saturation 30 minute oxygen therapy initial saturation &lt; 92 % . Primary parasitological measure include : presence absence Cryptosporidium stool ( detect modify acid fast stain PCR ) ; presence absence Cryptosporidium sputum ( detected PCR ) ; presence absence Cryptosporidium saliva ( detected PCR ) . Secondary clinical measure include : HIV status ( determine voluntary HIV test via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay + reverse transcriptase PCR child age less 18 month ) ; CD4+ counts/percentages ( measure flow cytometry child test HIV ) ; concurrent respiratory infection ( determined processing sputum routine bacterial pathogen , tuberculosis pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia ; anemia ( determined hemoglobin measurement complete blood count ) ; nutritional status ( determine weight-for-age score , height-for-age score , weight-for-height score , head circumference , mid upper arm circumference ) . Secondary parasitological measurement include : specie Cryptosporidium stool , sputum , saliva ( determined restriction fragment length polymorphism ) . Subject participation duration study dependent health status child admission extent clinical care require . In uncomplicated case , subject duration may short 4 hour . In subject require extensive clinical care subject duration may extend 2 day .</detailed_description>
