	<brief_title>Study Combretastatin Paclitaxel/Carboplatin Treatment Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma ( ATC ) high-grade neoplasm , characterize aggressive clinical course brief survival , refractoriness currently available local systemic modality treatment . There standard therapy ATC , randomize comparative trial know conducted disease . One potential strategy combine anti-tumor activity vascular disrupt agent combretastatin conventional cytotoxic agent . This study compare overall survival ATC patient treat triplet combination combretastatin , paclitaxel , carboplatin compare doublet treatment paclitaxel carboplatin .</detailed_description>
