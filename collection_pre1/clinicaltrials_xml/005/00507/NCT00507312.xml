	<brief_summary>This study test two device design detect cardiovascular disease patient early possible . As many therapy prevent treat condition believe detect early help reduce burden disease permit effective treatment . The two device investigator test ViScope develop HD Medical device develop CSIRO . Both device simple , non-invasive may provide useful information well heart contract relax well valve function heart . The investigator plan enroll 100 healthy subject , 100 participant risk factor heart failure 300 patient vary type heart failure . The data collect experimental device compare result standard test . Patients therapy alter part study .</brief_summary>
