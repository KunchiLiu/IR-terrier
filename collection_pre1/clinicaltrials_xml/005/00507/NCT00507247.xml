	<detailed_description>Daptomycin new antibiotic . It may effective variety bacterial infection difficult treat . Aztreonam , Cefepime , Carbapenems Augmentin antibiotic use treat certain type bacteria . If find eligible take part study , give daptomycin vein least 10 day , depend certain type bacteria . You receive Daptomycin vein 30 minute every 24 hour . The CVC associate CRBSI ( catheter-related bloodstream infection = CR-BSI ) enrol patient either remove exchange guide wire new CVC within 96 hour onset first blood culture . Your primary doctor decide whether remove exchange CVC willingness . If study doctor and/or primary physician know think mixed infection ( `` gram positive '' `` gram negative '' ) may infection lung ( pneumonia ) , may also treat antibiotic drug Aztreonam , Cefepime , Carbapenems , Augmentin vein mouth combination study drug Daptomycin . During week treatment , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine lab test . The blood sample may draw CVC , CVC still place . In addition , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn every day long show sign infection . The catheter exit site may examine visit sign symptoms infection . If discharge hospital complete study medication , arrangement make provide infusion out-patient basis home infusion . During week treatment , ask symptom illness experience . In addition , ask inform study doctor and/or study staff medication therapy take study . You take study infection get bad intolerable side effect occur . Participation study last 60 day . If discharge hospital , end treatment visit take place within 7 -14 day last day study drug . You need return visit outpatient basis . At visit , physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( heart rate , temperature , blood pressure ) . Blood sample ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test check infection . The blood sample may draw CVC , CVC still place . The CVC exit site examine . You ask symptom illness may experience . In addition , ask inform study doctor and/or study staff medication therapy take . You follow-up exam 32 ( +/- 7 ) day last dose study drug . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( heart rate , temperature , blood pressure ) . Blood ( one tablespoon ) drawn routine test check infection . The blood sample may draw CVC , CVC still place . The CVC exit site may examine . You ask symptom illness may experience . In addition , ask inform study doctor and/or study staff medication therapy take . Participation study end complete follow-up visit . This investigational study . Daptomycin approve FDA treatment skin soft tissue infection . However , use describe study dose level , Daptomycin authorize FDA use research . About 50 patient take part study . All enrol University Texas ( UT ) MD Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) .</detailed_description>
