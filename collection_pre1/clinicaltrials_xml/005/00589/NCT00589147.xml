	<brief_summary>SUMMARY A prospective , randomize , single-blinded clinical trial propose compare three tibial tray design patient undergo total knee arthroplasty . This study design address clinically important issue tibial component modularity fixation total knee replacement . The Zimmer NexGen Legacy knee system FDA approve device study use 1 ) modular tibial tray insert cement 2 ) non-modular tibial tray insert cement , 3 ) non-modular tibial tray insert without cement . The insertion total knee component without cement do clinically 20 year specifically approve FDA . Thus treatment arm 3 , non-modular tray insert without cement , would involve so-called off-label use device . 136 case assign arm study . Each patient assess two month surgery , one year surgery , two year surgery , five year surgery , every three five year thereafter . The principal outcome measure Knee Society Clinical rating scale , SF-36 presence significant lucent lines.. These measure compare among patient 3 trial arm 5 year post surgery ( last follow-up point drop become lost follow-up ) . The Knee Society score SF-36 score analyze use analysis variance model Rates significant lucencies , perioperative mortality , well complication deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , neurovascular complication , infection compare among group use chi-square test . Rates revision surgery compare among group use survivorship method . PURPOSE The primary aim study compare result obtain three tibial design patient undergo total knee arthroplasty . Those result measure disease-specific ( Knee Society Scores ) , global ( SF-36 ) , outcome measure . Radiographic result consist stand alignment , lateral skyline view surgical knee record analyze . Completion intial investigation occur 5-year interval last enrolled patient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients great equal 20 less equal 85 undergoing unilateral primary knee surgery degenerative joint disease ( DJD ) . Age le 20 year &gt; 85 . Severe deformity great equal 20 degree varus , valgus malalignment flexion deformity . Osteomyelitis , septicemia , prior infection knee joint , active infection may spread area body . The presence infection , highly communicable disease , e.g . AIDS , active tuberculosis , venereal disease , hepatitis . Significant neurological musculoskeletal disorder disease may adversely affect normal gait weight bearing . Metastatic disease . Any congenital , developmental , bone disease previous knee surgery may , surgeon 's judgement , interfere TK prosthesis survival success , e.g . Paget 's disease , Charcot 's disease secondary diabetes , severe osteoporosis , previous high tibial osteotomy , etc . Presence previous prosthetic knee replacement device ( type ) . Arthrodesis affect knee . Patients require patella resurfacing .</criteria>
