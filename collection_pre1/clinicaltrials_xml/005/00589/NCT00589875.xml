	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety potential efficacy Gene Mediated Cytotoxic Immunotherapy malignant glioma . The approach use adenoviral vector ( disabled virus ) engineer express Herpes thymidine kinase gene ( aglatimagene besadenovec , AdV-tk ) , follow antiherpetic prodrug , valacyclovir . The AdV-tk vector inject resection bed standard tumor surgery valacyclovir pill take 14 day . Standard radiation chemotherapy administer show work cooperatively AdV-tk + prodrug kill tumor cell . The hypothesis combination therapy safely deliver lead improvement clinical outcome patient newly diagnose malignant glioma , include glioblastoma multiforme ( WHO grade IV ) anaplastic astrocytomas ( WHO grade III ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2a Study AdV-tk With Standard Radiation Therapy Malignant Glioma ( BrTK02 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients resectable partially resectable malignant glioma receive injection AdV-tk remain tumor tumor bed resection . Pathologic confirmation malignant glioma must make prior AdV-tk injection ; possible , injection perform subject longer eligible study . The oral prodrug , valacyclovir , start 1-3 day AdV-tk injection continue 14 day . Standard radiotherapy begin average 7 day AdV-tk injection up-front course . Patients receive temozolomide per standard care completion prodrug .</detailed_description>

Patients previously receive AdVtk + prodrug study may receive additional AdVtk + prodrug course recurrence eligibility criterion still meet . Tumor must accessible injection must locate brainstem , midbrain , contain within ventricular system , locate infratentorial location . Must plan undergo standard radiation therapy . Performance status KPS 70 . SGOT ( AST ) &lt; 3x upper limit normal . Serum creatinine &lt; 2mg/dl calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 10ml/min . Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3 WBC &gt; 3000/mm3 . Patients reproductive age must agree use medically accept form birth control study . Must give study specific inform consent prior enrollment . For readministration , patient must reconsented . Must able tolerate MRI scan procedure Active liver disease include cirrhosis hepatitis Patients immunosuppressive drug ( exception corticosteroid ) Known HIV+ patient . Acute infection ( viral , bacterial fungal infection require therapy ) . Pregnant breast feeding patient . Female patient childbearing age must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 1 week begin therapy . Evidence metastatic disease malignancy ( except squamous basal cell skin cancer ) . Other serious comorbid illness compromise organ function . May receive chemotherapy valacyclovir complete May receive investigational antitumor agent within 30 day prior study entry active participation study ( define AdVtk injection tumor progression ) .</criteria>
