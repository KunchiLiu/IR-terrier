	<brief_summary>Overall result treatment middle age adult acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) substantially improve last decade , complete remission ( CR ) rate establish value 70 80per cent also encouraging long-term outcome , especially patient tolerate intensified post remissional treatment strategy . On contrary , little progress treatment old patient . In patient response rate generally range 40 60per cent , overall survival 2 year often less 10 per cent . Usually , combination anthracyclines daunomycin DNR doxorubicin cytarabyne Ara-C utilized remission-induction treatment , schedule similar utilized young case , patient eligible intensive treatment . Variation dose DNR bring significant benefit . The EORTC HOVON randomize trial AML9 compare two drug induction previously untreated patient . DNR versus Mithoxantrone ( MTZ ) . MTZ induction therapy produce slightly good CR rate DNR-containing regimen ( 47per cent v 38per cent , P equal 0.069 ) , without significant effect remission duration survival . The DFS probability two treatment arm different . The median DFS estimate 39 week group . The DFS rate 5 year 8per cent . Also duration survival similar ( p equal 0.23 ) two treatment group . Median survival estimate 36 week ( DNR ) 39 week ( MTZ ) . The percentage patient still alive 5 year 6per cent 9per cent respectively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It state single agent DaunoXome seem associate level anti-leukemic activity least equivalent conventional drug available . In addition , safety profile DaunoXome either single agent either combination Ara-C seem improved respect conventionally administer anthracyclines . Therefore , seem warrant explore anti-leukemic activity , toxicity long term result DaunoXome treatment AML association Ara-C parent compound daunorubicin . In particular , propose study evaluate standard 3+7 schedule versus schedule DaunoXome instead daunorubicine front line treatment AML patient older 60 year . Patients achieve CR receive consolidation cycle drug dos . After consolidation , patient CR randomize receive maintenance treatment low-dose Ara-C plus Atra versus treatment .</detailed_description>
