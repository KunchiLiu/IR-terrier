	<brief_title>To Compare Safety Efficacy Doripenem Versus Imipenem-Cilastatin Patients With Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither physician patient know treatment patient receives ) , active-controlled ( agent compare study medication test whether study medication real effect clinical study ) , double-dummy ( placebo [ inactive substance compare medication test whether medication real effect clinical study ] administer maintain blind comparator medication make identical study medication ) , parallel-group ( group patient treat time ) , multicenter study ass effectiveness safety 7 day course doripenem , compare 10 day course imipenem-cilastatin patient ventilator-associated pneumonia . This study consist 3 phase : ( 1 ) pretreatment phase maximum 24 hour screening/baseline visit , ( 2 ) double blind , double dummy , treatment phase 10 day ( Day 1 Day 10 ) end-of-treatment ( EOT ) assessment within 24 hour last dose study medication therapy administer Day 10 time early withdrawal study medication , ( 3 ) post treatment ( follow-up ) phase consist early follow-up ( EFU ) visit within 7 14 day last dose study medication , last follow-up ( LFU ) visit within 28 35 day last dose study medication patient include discontinue study medication early . Two hundred seventy four patient randomly assign receive either doripenem imipenem placebo medication give simultaneously maintain blind ( eg , 1 group receive blind doripenem Days 1 7 imipenem placebo Days 1 10 , group receive blind imipenem Days 1 10 doripenem placebo Days 1 7 ) . A sample secretion low respiratory tract obtain bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) mini-BAL within 36 hour prior administration study medication enrol patient sent culture . Patients , whose baseline BAL mini-BAL culture result yield least 1 qualify pneumonia pathogen continue receive study medication therapy patient , whose baseline BAL mini-BAL culture result yield least 1 qualify pneumonia pathogen discontinue study medication therapy remain enroll study follow safety . Safety evaluation include adverse event , clinical laboratory evaluation , vital sign physical examination monitor throughout study period . The total duration individual patient 's participation study approximately 5 6 week .</detailed_description>
