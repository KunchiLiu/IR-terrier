	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make gene-modified virus person 's dendritic cell may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Celecoxib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving vaccine therapy together celecoxib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give vaccine therapy together celecoxib work treat patient metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate clinical benefit rate ( complete response , partial response , stable disease ≥ 14 week ) patient metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma treat autologous dendritic cell ( DC ) transduce AD5F35 express LMP-1 LMP-2 administer combination celecoxib . Secondary - To evaluate toxicity regimen patient . - To evaluate specific T-cell response LMP-1 LMP-2 measure HLA tetramer technology , ELISPOT assay , delayed-type hypersensitivity patient treat regimen . - To evaluate surrogate tumor marker response plasma EBV DNA real-time PCR patient . - To evaluate characterize immunological cell type tumor characteristic biopsy specimen patient treat DC vaccine compare pre-vaccine biopsy specimen . - To evaluate progression-free survival overall survival patient show initial clinical benefit DC vaccine . OUTLINE : Patients undergo blood collection preparation autologous dendritic cell ( DC ) vaccine . Immature DCs transduce latent membrane protein-1 ( LMP-1 ) latent membrane protein-2 ( LMP-2 ) use adenoviral vector 5F35 . Beginning 1 week blood collection , patient receive vaccination autologous DCs transduce AD5F35-LMP-1/LMP-2 intradermally every 2 week total 5 vaccination . Patients also receive celecoxib twice day begin 1 week first vaccination continue 6 week completion last vaccination . Patients demonstrate clinical benefit completion 5 course vaccination may continue receive DC vaccine alone study every 2 week disease progression ( base CT scan finding ) investigator 's discretion . Patients undergo blood tumor tissue sample collection periodically laboratory study . Blood sample analyze use MHC tetramer analysis ; enzyme-linked immunospot ( ELISPOT ) analysis ; EBV DNA titer assess response ; flow cytometry ass lymphocyte kinetics . Tumor tissue sample use immunological study . Delayed-type hypersensitivity also assess . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 1 year .</detailed_description>
