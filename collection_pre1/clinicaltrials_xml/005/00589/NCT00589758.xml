	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study learn take picture heart use two dimensional three dimensional echocardiography heart failure intensive care unit helpful understanding heart work . All research subject adult admit heart failure ICU acute decompensated heart failure require monitor heart function use catheter place pulmonary artery blood vessel . In situation , use pulmonary artery catheter , PAC , consider standard clinical care . It research procedure . The PAC would use even participate research project . All research subject evaluate time admit ICU , 24 48 hour admission ICU , 7 day leave ICU . At three time point , take picture heart use two dimensional three dimensional echocardiogram . Additionally , time-point , collect blood sample approximately two half tablespoon time , urine sample . We test sample biomarkers heart failure proteins enzyme specifically related heart function . We conduct genetic research sample . Any extra blood research test save future research . We also look data collect pulmonary artery catheter . The catheter sensor measure thing like blood flow pressure heart . At Day 7 post discharge visit six minute hall walk access distance walk . We access symptom may experience . A nurse physician monitor six minute hall walk . The research information collect place medical record . The data research purpose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design This single-center , prospective cohort study . The project carry Main Campus Cleveland Clinic Foundation . Comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography perform Heart Failure Intensive Care Unit Cleveland Clinic Foundation . This eight bed intensive care unit dedicate treat patient acute clinical issue relate heart failure staff heart failure specialist , medical officer nurse specialize heart failure management . Therapy individualized per patient entirely discretion patient ' cardiologist standard care . Nevertheless , Heart Failure Intensive Care Unit standard drug protocol intravenous vasodilator nitroglycerin sodium nitroprusside , well inotropic therapy dobutamine milrinone , pressor norepinephrine vasopressin . Based hemodynamic assessment use PAC , diuretic vasodilator first-line agent , follow inotropic agent . Oral vasodilator institute follow standard protocol . All medication dos note time echocardiographic evaluation . The schedule follow : 1 . The first echo perform within 24 hour PAC insertion . Preferably time prior commence treatment Heart Failure Intensive Care unit . 2 . The second echo perform 24-72 hour baseline echo Heart Failure Intensive Care unit . 3 . The third echo perform time schedule outpatient visit hospital discharge . The test perform General Clinical Research Center outpatient visit locate fifth floor M building Cardiology Desk F-17 . Timeline individual patient : Data Extraction Invasive Hemodynamics : All patient PAC insert , usually via right jugular venous approach , clinical indication prior recruitment This required inclusion study . Data collect baseline time second echo include systolic diastolic blood pressure , heart rate rhythm , central venous pressure , systolic mean pulmonary artery pressure , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure , cardiac output index Fick equation , calculate cardiac power , systemic pulmonary vascular resistance , transpulmonary gradient . Thermodilution derive RV ejection fraction also perform . A dedicated hemodynamic database capturing mention variable already design implement routine clinical use Heart Failure Intensive Care Unit . Since observational study , perform concurrent clinical trial . Echocardiographic study : All echocardiogram perform ultrasound machine capable two dimensional echocardiogram strain image use GE Vivid 7 machine three dimensional echocardiogram use GE Vivid 7 machine Phillips ultrasound machine . Each patient undergo echocardiographic assessment standard ultrasound machine equip 3.5 MHz transducer capable digital image storage . All echocardiogram perform ultrasound machine bedside , capable two dimensional echocardiography strain image use GE Vivid 7machine , three dimensional echocardiography use GE Vivid 7 machine Phillips ultrasound machine . The reason broad range study period allow flexibility perform echocardiography fit patient ' treatment plan Heart Failure Intensive Care Unit . Our experience conduct kind study Heart Failure Intensive Care Unit lead u believe range time often helpful . Patients admit overnight weekend , without compromise objective study . Since objective study determine role serial echocardiographic parameter without hemodynamic data predict need invasive intervention correlate treatment response infusion , design close `` real-world '' logistics unlikely affect study result . Patients place left lateral decubitus position . When possible patient ventilator , modify view obtain . Standard parasternal long short axis well standard apical four , three two chamber view obtain . Subcostal image acquire possible . The echocardiogram include assessment leave right ventricular systolic diastolic function valvular function . Assessment systolic function include : left ventricular end-systolic end-diastolic diameter , leave ventricular outflow tract diameter , leave ventricular volume , pulse Doppler Left ventricular outflow tract . Biplane leave ventricular ejection fraction , stroke volume , cardiac output index calculate . Right-sided measurement include , right ventricular end diastolic systolic area , pulse wave Doppler tricuspid valve . Strain acquire view along pulse wave tissue Doppler leave right ventricular annulus . Cardiac Biomarkers : A total 40cc blood sample collection plasma ( 20cc ) serum ( 20cc ) collect echo study , process aliquotted within 2 hour GCRC core lab . Biomarkers interest include : ( 1 ) plasma B-type natriuretic peptide every visit , ( 2 ) cardiac troponin T baseline , ( 3 ) high-sensitive C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) baseline , send clinical laboratory analysis . Extra blood collect every visit store -80F freezer research-based novel biomarkers , subject availability supplementary external research funding . Six minute hall walk Standard Six minute hall walk perform assess functional capacity GCRC follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
