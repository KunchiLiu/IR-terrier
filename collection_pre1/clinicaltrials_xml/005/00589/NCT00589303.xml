	<brief_title>AV Node Ablation Pacemaker Therapy Compared Drug Therapy Atrial Fibrillation - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiologic study show 70-80 % patient atrial fibrillation old 65 year age . Drug therapy atrial fibrillation effective tolerate many elderly patient , rate rhythm strategy . Preliminary data AVN ablation pacemaker therapy demonstrate strategy highly effective control symptom among patient fail numerous drug therapy . Quality life improve hospital admission office visit reduce . Pilot Study Design - All patient 1:1 randomized standard-care drug therapy ( American College Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline , 2006 ) AV node ablation pacemaker therapy - For patient randomize AVN ablation , 1:1 sub-randomization conventional right ventricular apex pace cardiac resynchronization therapy ( biventricular pacing ) - All patient follow 2 6 month time randomization pilot study . - A total 60 patient 5-15 clinical site enrol active recruiting period 12 month pilot study .</detailed_description>
