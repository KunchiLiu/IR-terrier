	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving sorafenib together docetaxel may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study give sorafenib together docetaxel see well work treat patient metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Docetaxel Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond Previous Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine proportion patient achieve 50 % reduction serum PSA baseline patient androgen-independent prostate cancer ( AIPC ) receive sorafenib tosylate docetaxel . Secondary - To estimate progression-free survival patient AIPC . - To quantify number percent patient stable disease 6 month therapy ( failure progress ) . - To estimate median time progression patient . - To estimate objective response rate patient AIPC treat regimen . - To measure percentage patient survive 2 year . - To determine toxicity estimate toxicity rate patient treated regimen . - To measure change tumor vasculature response therapy select patient dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI ( DCE-MRI ) correlate primary secondary objective measurement change . - To measure change serum HMGB1 response therapy correlate primary secondary objective change . - To measure change serum cathepsin D response therapy correlate primary secondary objective change . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily day 2-19 docetaxel IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 10 course . Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate alone twice daily day 1-19 treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood collection periodically measure serum HMGB1 cathepsin D level therapy .</detailed_description>
