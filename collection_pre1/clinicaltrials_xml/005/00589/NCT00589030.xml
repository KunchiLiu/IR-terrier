	<brief_title>Yttrium Y 90 Radiolabeled Glass Beads Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Provide supervise access treatment yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres ( TheraSphere® ) eligible patient primary cancer liver surgical resection candidate . - Evaluate patient experience toxicity associate TheraSphere® treatment . - Enter treatment experience liver database . Secondary - Determine tumor response rate patient receive treatment . OUTLINE : This humanitarian device exemption use study . Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres ( TheraSphere® ) via percutaneous hepatic arterial infusion . Patients may retreat 30-90 day initial infusion . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day annually thereafter 2 year .</detailed_description>
