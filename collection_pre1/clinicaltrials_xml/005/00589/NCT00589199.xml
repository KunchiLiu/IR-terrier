	<brief_summary>The purpose present study assess utility abdominal muscle stimulation provide large positive airway pressure expiratory airflow thus simulate cough . Restoration cough spinal cord injure patient may reduce incidence respiratory complication atelectasis , respiratory tract infection respiratory failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cough complex defensive respiratory reflex mechanism necessary clearance respiratory secretion foreign material . In patient chronic bronchitis , previous investigation find cough mechanism effective measure enhance mucous clearance lung . Patients cervical thoracic spinal cord injury suffer loss major portion expiratory muscle . Consequently , unable generate significant positive intrathoracic airway pressure airflow markedly increase risk develop pulmonary infection . Mechanical method develop enhance cough production . However , result marginal increase airway pressure . Preliminary study laboratory animal experiment others human suggest abdominal muscle stimulate directly surface electrode . The purpose present study , therefore , assess utility abdominal muscle stimulation quadriplegic paraplegic simulate cough . A range stimulus parameter electrode location assess determine optimal stimulus paradigm . Airway pressure expiratory airflow use index cough effectiveness . If successful , abdominal muscle stimulation may useful tool restore cough hopefully reduce incidence respiratory complication atelectasis infection spinal cord injure patient .</detailed_description>
