	<brief_summary>Pain , weakness , instability , progressive dysfunction hallmark arthritis knee . Total knee replacement may frequently therapeutic intervention provide adequate improvement pain function . Both fixed bearing mobile bearing knee long track record clinical success . Mobile bearing design theoretical advantage decrease contact stress tibial tray , decrease polyethylene wear , improve range motion relative fix bearing design . These theoretical advantage may become especially important young patient require knee arthroplasty . This study attempt see clinical difference outcome mobile bearing fix bear knee arthroplasty patient require total knee replacement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison A Mobile-Bearing Total Knee System With A Fixed-Bearing Total Knee System In Cemented Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , single-blinded clinical trial compare mobile-bearing total knee system two type fixed-bearing total knee system patient undergo cemented total knee arthroplasty . The device use FDA approve : Sigma Knee System ( mobile-bearing ) , Sigma , Pressfit Condylar posterior cruciate substituting ( fixed-bearing ) system metal back tibial tray , Sigma press-fit condylar posterior cruciate substituting system ( fixed bearing ) polyethylene tibial tray . The surgical procedure perform 4 experienced orthopedic surgeon subspecialty interest total knee arthroplasty . A midline skin incision medial parapatellar arthrotomy use expose knee . The distal femoral resection perform intramedullary alignment guide , proximal tibial resection perform extramedullary alignment guide . Knees fixed deformity surgical release contract tissue medial lateral side , appropriate , obtain symmetric balance total knee replacement flexion extension . The flexion extension gap medial lateral soft-tissue structure balance accordance standard technique . Patients begin progressive weight-bearing first postoperative day , active knee range motion initiate 24 hour surgery . Patients typically discharge fourth fifth postoperative day obtain ability walk walker , ascend several stair , flex knee 290 degree . Patients ask return examination radiographs 3 month , 1 year , 2 year , 5 year surgery .</detailed_description>
