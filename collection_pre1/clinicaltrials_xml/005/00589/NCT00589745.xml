	<brief_summary>The purpose research study provide novel method diagnosis Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) . This protocol design test ability cell regulate movement salt water people feature CF diagnosis entirely clear . We study cell nose , technique call nasal transepithelial potential difference ( NPD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nasal Potential Difference ( NPD ) Diagnosis Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) autosomal recessive systemic disorder exocrine glands secretory epithelium . The disease result mutation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene cause variety abnormality . CFTR absent dysfunctional cystic fibrosis . Most defect CFTR result abnormal chloride ion transport abnormally viscous mucus . Nasal epithelial CFTR function assess NPD procedure . NPD measurement useful diagnostic tool individual borderline normal sweat chloride , one identify CFTR mutation , clinical history suggestive CF . The NPD become gold standard detection quantification CFTR function airway . The assay also serve important endpoint since 1981 . It use extensively standardized ass ability new therapeutic study design replace , repair restore defective ion transport CF patient . The assay basically involve drip small amount test solution anterior nostril order measure uptake secretion sodium chloride . There five solution require NPD measurement : - Solution # 1 : Buffered Ringers - Solution # 2 : Solution # 1+Amiloride - Solution # 3 : Buffered Zero Chloride Solution + Amiloride - Solution # 4 : Solution # 3 + Isoproterenol - Solution # 5 : Solution # 4 + Adenosine 5'-Triphosphate-Disodium salt ( ATP ) The Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics Development Network ( TDN ) formal affiliation CF Research Centers US . Two Standard Operating Procedures develop TDN NPD procedure qualification perform measurement . Procedure Details : Briefly , series stopcock configure allow perfusion solution port tip explore catheter ( PE50 tube . All test solution perfuse rate 5.0 cc per minute . In nostril , PD read Ringer 's 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 cm ( lumen negative ) average take average 'baseline ' PD . The catheter tip place negative PD site maintain superperfusion measurement small piece tape apply nasal tip ( hold catheter duration protocol ) . All solution warm 37˚C prior contact nasal mucosa . For perfusion condition , steady-state recording obtain . The recording last least one minute ( Solution # 1 ) three minute ( Solutions # 2 , 3 , 4 ) prior proceed next solution within sequence . Solution # 5 perfuse minimum one minute , confirm retention ATP-activated Clˉ secretion CF non-CF individual . Several reading obtain data analysis , nasal P.D . tracing score investigator .</detailed_description>
