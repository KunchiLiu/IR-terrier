	<detailed_description>Suicide attempt associate increased likelihood eventual death suicide ( Lonnqvist &amp; Ostano , 1991 ) , increase risk repeat suicidal behavior ( Goldston et al. , 1999 ; Leon et al. , 1989 ) , risk physical injury , suicidality also one primary reason psychiatric emergency psychiatric hospitalization ( Peterson et al. , 1996 ) . Suicide attempter , particularly repeat attempter , often histories depression substance abuse problem . Cognitive behavioral intervention show promise treatment depression ( Brent et al. , 1997 ) , suicidality ( Henriques , Beck , &amp; Brown , 2002 ) , substance use disorder youth ( Dennis et al. , press ; Kaminer et al. , 2002 ) . Relapse prevention approach show utility substance abuse adult ( Witkiewitz &amp; Marlatt , 2004 ) , conceptually well suit prevention suicidal behavior substance use among young people . The purpose research outline application therefore develop , refine , test cognitive behavioral relapse prevention intervention ( CBT-RP ) dually diagnose suicidal adolescent young adult . The specific aim research follow : 1 . To develop refine cognitive behavioral relapse prevention treatment manual suicidal adolescent young adult comorbid depressive substance use disorder . 2 . To develop pilot test procedure train therapist conduct CBT-RP . Methods assess therapist competence adherence protocol , certification standard develop refine . 3 . To assess feasibility CBT-RP via monitoring rate recruitment retention subject , monitor therapist adherence deviation protocol , monitor adverse event . 4 . To assess feasibility assessment method outcome measure use study reflect burden complete assessment course treatment . 5 . To estimate degree change variability response CBT-RP relative CBT-RP add-on treatment Treatment Usual ( TAU ) community primary outcome suicidal ideation , depressive symptom , substance use problem severity . 6 . To assess acceptability CBT-RP relative CBT-RP add-on treatment TAU community assess qualitatively via exit interview quantitatively via rating patient satisfaction There four phase treatment development study : ( 1 ) initial manual protocol development ( require human subject involvement ) ; ( 2 ) piloting ( revision ) manual investigator ; ( 3 ) training supervision new therapist use new intervention ; , ( 4 ) pilot randomize control trial . We complete first phase study . Currently , involve complete pilot test initiate train new therapist protocol ( n=12 ) . A subsequent pilot randomize controlled trial use examine feasibility preliminary evidence effect ( variability effect ) CBT-RP augment intervention ( n=36 ) .</detailed_description>
