	<brief_summary>Background : - Cisplatin-containing chemotherapy standard treatment advance tumor thymus remove surgically . - New treatment option need patient advanced tumor thymus improve cisplatin-containing therapy . - Belinostat drug inhibits enzymes call histone deacetylase . Histone deacetylase inhibitor show promising activity many cancer may useful treat patient thymic tumor . Objectives : -To ass safety effectiveness belinostat treatment malignant thymic tumor patient fail standard treatment . Eligibility : -Patients 18 year age old advanced thymic tumor progress treatment platinum-containing chemotherapy . Design : - Patients receive belinostat treatment 21-day cycle . The drug give infusion vein day 1 5 cycle . Treatment cycle continue long medicine tolerate cancer worsen . - Patients physical examination several blood test every cycle . - Patients electrocardiogram every cycle start belinostat infusion last day infusion . - Patients undergo compute tomography ( CT ) image test , ultrasound MRI , every two cycle evaluate response tumor treatment . - Tumor tissue obtain previous biopsy use research purpose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Cisplatin-containing chemotherapy standard care advance unresectable thymoma thymic carcinoma . New option treatment necessary patient advance thymoma thymic carcinoma progress cisplatin-containing therapy . Histone deacetylase inhibitor show promising clinical activity many malignancy . Belinostat , potent histone deacetylase inhibitor , promise agent , may activity patient thymic malignancy . Objectives : - To assess objective response rate accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria belinostat monotherapy . - To assess safety belinostat . - To evaluate time response , duration response , progression-free survival overall survival . - To identify chromosomal gain loss gene methylation status comparative genomic hybridization methylation microarrays thymoma / thymic carcinoma relation clinical outcome . - To assess expression level particular protein pretreatment tumor sample , immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) correlate clinical outcome . - To identify measure change p21 protein hyperacetylation peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) plasma correlate clinical outcome . - To measure change modulation T-cell function peripheral blood lymphocyte . Eligibility : - Patients histologically confirm thymic carcinoma thymoma previously treat least one platinum contain chemotherapy regimen . - Measurable disease RECIST criterion . - Adequate renal , hepatic hematopoietic function . - QT Interval must less 500 msec baseline electrocardiogram ( EKG ) ( Fridericia 's formula use correction ) . - No major surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy within 28 day belinostat therapy . Design : - Patients receive belinostat 30-minute intravenous ( IV ) infusion 1000 mg/m^2/day day 1-5 every 3 week . After 12 cycle treatment , cycle give every 4 week . - Treatment belinostat alone continue disease progression . - Toxicity assess every cycle Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) Version 3.0 December 31 , 2010 , CTCAE Version 4.0 begin January 1 , 2011 . - Tumor response assessment RECIST criterion perform every 2 cycle . After 12 cycle , response assessment every 3 cycle . - Correlative study include comparative genomic hybridization , methylation microarray analysis , tissue immunohistochemistry study do exist tumor block . - Blood sample circulate plasma biomarkers response include VEGF drawn first day cycle 1 2 well cycle 1 , day 3 . - Blood sample protein hyperacetylation T cell modulation analyse draw first day cycle 1 2 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Histologically confirm invasive recurrent metastatic thymoma thymic carcinoma pathology department / Center Cancer Research ( CCR ) / National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) . Patients must least one prior platincontaining chemotherapy regimen . There limit number prior chemotherapy regimens receive . Progressive disease document entry study . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) great 20 mm conventional technique great 10 mm spiral compute tomography ( CT ) scan . Patients must recover toxicity relate prior therapy least grade 1 ( defined Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) 3.0 December 31 , 2010 , CTCAE 4.0 begin January 1 , 2011 ) must prior chemotherapy within 4 week . Patients must least 28 day since prior radiation major surgery . Target lesion select within previously irradiate area , newly arise clearly progress irradiation proven repeat scan . Concurrent corticosteroid myasthenia gravis , paraneoplastic syndrome , chronic condition allow . Age great 18 year . Life expectancy great 3 month . Performance status ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) ) less equal 2 . Patients must adequate organ marrow function ( define ) . Patients must return base line grade one acute toxicity relate prior therapy . Laboratory Test/Required Value : Absolute neutrophil count great 1,500/microl . Platelets great 100,000/microl . International normalized ratio ( INR ) less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) abnormality explain presence lupus anticoagulant therapeutic range anticoagulation . Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) /serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) /serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) less equal 3 time institutional upper limit normal . Creatinine le equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal Calculated Creatinine great 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine . Clearance level institutional normal . The effect belinostat develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation continue least 2 month completion . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother belinostat , breastfeed discontinue mother treated belinostat . Ability comply intravenous administration schedule , ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients symptomatic brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . However , patient treatment brain metastasis whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable least 3 month without steroid may enrol discretion principal investigator . Uncontrolled medical illness include , limited , ongoing uncontrolled , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( American Heart Association ( AHA ) Class II worse ) , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Marked baseline prolongation Q wave , T wave ( QT ) /corrected QT ( QTc ) interval , e.g. , repeat demonstration QTc interval great 500 msec ( Fridericia 's formula use correction ) ; Long QT Syndrome . Any concomitant medication may cause QTc prolongation , induce Torsades de Pointes . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction belinostat . ( HIV ) positive patient receive antiretroviral therapy exclude due possibility belinostat may worsen condition likelihood underlying condition may obscure attribution adverse event respect belinostat . Patients may receive investigational agent . History another invasive malignancy last five year . Adequately treated noninvasive , nonmelanoma skin cancer well situ carcinoma cervix allow . Prior treatment drug HDAC inhibitor class . Patients tumor amenable potentially curative therapy assess investigator . Subjects resectable tumor would eligible study .</criteria>
