	<brief_summary>Understanding mechanisms obesity-induced hypertension important prevention therapy . Studies patient establish obesity provide valuable information pathophysiologic link obesity blood pressure cardiovascular risk . However , study necessarily limited heterogeneity obesity-associated disease relative contribution obesity hypertension co-existing disease specific regulatory abnormality often clear . Clarification whether abnormality associate increase cardiovascular risk present development obesity also problematic . We therefore propose series novel study direct establish effect increase body fat otherwise healthy individual . We determine distribution pattern increase body fat increase body fat fat distribution relate change blood pressure , neural , endothelial inflammatory mechanism implicate development progression cardiac vascular disease . We study non-obese subject without family history hypertension . These subject undergo eight-week program overfeed objective induce 4 kg fat gain . We determine nature fat distribution individual fat gain program subsequently eight-week period weight loss restoration normal body weight . Measurements compare obtain matched control group without family history hypertension , continue normal diet . We test follow hypothesis : - Individuals family history hypertension gain visceral fat upper body subcutaneous fat great blood pressure increase overfeeding- compare without family history . - For overfed subject , increase blood pressure insulin resistance fat gain mark individual predominantly upper body visceral fat accumulation . - Upper body visceral fat gain also associate great impairment cardiovascular function , high nocturnal blood pressure increase likelihood sleep disorder breathing .</brief_summary>
