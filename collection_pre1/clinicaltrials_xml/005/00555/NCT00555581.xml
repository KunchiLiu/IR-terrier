	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety tolerability imatinib mesylate ( Gleevec ) patient systemic sclerosis ( scleroderma ) . Gleevec medication already FDA approve treatment chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) , dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans tumor , Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia , hypereosinophilic syndrome , aggressive systemic mastocytosis . In-vitro study suggest imatinib may inhibit collagen production scleroderma fibroblast , mouse model fibrosis imatinib show decrease skin thickness . This Phase IIa , single center , prospective open label clinical trial Gleevec patient systemic sclerosis . All patient treat active drug 12 month . The primary objective study determine safety tolerability Gleevec patient systemic sclerosis , important secondary outcome relevance improvement disease status define skin score index pulmonary function . Patients complete initial phase ( describe ) study eligible participate extension phase . The purpose extension phase study give patient participate phase IIa clinical trial Gleevec Hospital Special Surgery opportunity continue Gleevec treatment treat physician patient agreement Gleevec acceptable safety tolerability , well possible efficacy initial year therapy .</brief_summary>
