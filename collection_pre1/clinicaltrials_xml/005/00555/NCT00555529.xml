	<brief_summary>- The purpose project validate peripheral arterial pressure waveform measurement technique RAAP ( radial artery applanation tonometry ) , patient moderate severe COPD ( Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ) , assess degree systemic endothelial dysfunction patient compare cigarette smoker normal lung function non-smokers normal lung function . - Patients moderate severe COPD ( GOLD stage II III ) study result compare age-matched healthy non- smoker smoker . - RAAP take every 5 minute 15 minute salbutamol every 5 minute another 15 minute salbutamol . - Several parameter lipoprotein profile , anti-oxidant plasma capacity , inflammatory cytokine , hormone , growth factor vascular cell adhesion molecule study blood . In addition , several inflammatory oxidative marker study exhaled breath condensate . Lung function impulse oscillometry make investigate airway resistance , exhale NO ( nitric oxide ) different expiratory flow measure assess alveolar bronchial NO . Clinical assessment include dyspnoea depression score also make .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>• Male subject COPD FEV1/FVC &lt; 70 % ; predict define either stage moderate GOLD II ( n=15 ) severe GOLD III ( n=7 ) diagnosis accord GOLD criterion ( Global Strategy Diagnosis , Management , Prevention COPD ) Male subject agematched nonsmoker ( n=8 ) male smoker ( n=8 ) normal lung function ( FEV1 &gt; 80 % , FEV1/FVC &gt; 70 % , n=8 ) Smokers : An active smoker pack history &gt; 10 pack year [ number pack year = ( number cigarette per day / 20 ) x number year smoke ] . Smokers need report time last cigarette smoke ( less 6 hour study visit ) . Patients allow use current anticholinergic bronchodilator continue dose inhaled corticosteroid currently use . However refrain short longacting β2agonists 6 12 hour , respectively , study visit . Aged 40 80 year inclusive Body mass index within range 1932kg/m2 inclusive FEV1 &lt; 15 % reversibility ( % predict ) increase &lt; 200ml inhaled β2agonists ( 400μg salbutamol ) . Capable give informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Subject available complete study . • As result medical interview , physical examination screen investigation , Physician Responsible considers volunteer unfit study . The subject participate study new molecular entity previous 3 month clinical trial previous 3 month . In case non invasive , clinical trial involve new molecular entity 2 week washout sufficient The subject regularly , average , drink 21 unit alcohol per week . The subject receive oral steroid within 2 week prior study entry . The subject history upper respiratory infection ( include sinusitis ) within 2 week prior study entry The subject hospitalise COPD exacerbation within 1 month study entry .</criteria>
