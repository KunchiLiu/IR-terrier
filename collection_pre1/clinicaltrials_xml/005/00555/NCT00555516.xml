	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis : EW02 polysaccharide-enriched crude extract black soybean ( BS ) . BS use extensively Chinese food traditional Chinese medicine hundred year . It use monotherapy treat Diabetes , menorrhagia leukorrhea . In combination others , BS use treat chemotherapy-induced leukopenia 300 pt . The daily dose 15g bid 50g tid 21 day . Side effect generally mild , include epigastric discomfort , numbness , insomnia , dry mouth . Recently BS find promote myelopoiesis inhibit tumor growth immunomodulation . In vitro assay show BS-PS stimulate production cytokine increase blood progenitor . In vivo study also demonstrate BS-PS reduce neutropenia mouse receive 5-FU stimulating myeloid colony formation . We hypothesize EW02 reduce neutropenia cancer patient receive chemotherapy without side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluate Safety Activities EW02 Reducing Neutropenia Caused Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study procedure : This single-center , double-blind , placebo-controlled parallel , pilot study oral EW02 combination chemotherapy , versus placebo combination chemotherapy breast cancer patient primary phase ( Cycle 1 ) . The chemotherapy regimen restrict one follow regimen : Doxorubicin + Cyclophosphamide ( AC ) , Doxorubicin+ Cyclophosphamide+5-FU ( CAF ) standardize dosage . The WBC recovery time similar two chemotherapy regimen due fact doxorubicin cyclophosphamide overlap dose CAF reduce . The principle investigator clinical experience neutropenia nadir severity cause two regimen almost . Nevertheless , pre-stratification chemotherapy regimen ( stratum AC versus stratum CAF ) randomization implement equal sample size two study product allocate stratum . It involve 60 outpatient breast cancer , previously demonstrate fall unto 1,000 3,000/mm3 WBC count , unto 500 1,500/mm3 ANC count , Day 8 Day 15 , whilst Cycle 1 . The second phase ( Cycle 2 ) : EW02 700mg tid daily versus placebo group give begin Cycle 2 15 consecutive day . 60 subject randomize 2:1 two group pre-stratified permuted block six four subject assign Group 1 ( EW02 ) two subject assign Group 2 ( Placebo ) . Group 1 receive EW02 15 consecutive day second cycle Group 2 receive 15 consecutive day Placebo . The extension phase ( Cycle 3 ) : design collect additional safety data ensure participant opportunity receive study drug . Thus , group receive EW02 700mg tid/day 15 consecutive day .</detailed_description>
