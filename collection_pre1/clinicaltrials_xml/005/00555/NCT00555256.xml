	<brief_summary>To define optimal dose sunitinib give combination rapamycin 2mg . To determine maximum tolerated dosage sunitinib rapamycin give fashion . To determine many time severe toxicity combination therapy . To determine quickly patient ( ) respond drug , overall survival time progression combination therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study SUNITINIB Rapamycin Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose conduct phase I study sunitinib rapamycin administer daily week 1-4 ) 6-week cycle . The rationale study include : - Sunitinib tyrosine kinase inhibitor target multiple receptor pathway critical cell growth . It antiangiogenic direct antitumor activity . - Resistance receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor well-documented . The mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) pathway may play critical role imatinib-refractory GIST . Rapamycin agent inhibit mTOR demonstrate antiangiogenic antitumor property decrease VEGF production decrease responsiveness VEGF . - Sunitinib approve well-tolerated dos high 75mg daily . The typical dose Phase II III trial 50mg/day , give four week on/two week schedule . There , however , recent trial look low dosage , 37.5 mg , NSCLC . - Rapamycin dose great 2 mg daily document well-tolerated renal transplant patient . In renal transplant patient , 2mg daily typical start dose . This dose use one phase I study rapamycin glioblastoma . - The administration two oral medication , take daily , may convenient patient iv administration chemotherapy infusion center every 1-3 week . - Based data , initial dose sunitinib begin 37.5 mg orally everyday 4 week , follow 2 week , combination rapamycin 2 mg/day orally 6 week 6 week cycle well tolerate allow dose-finding escalation .</detailed_description>

Patients may undergo major surgery within 4 week prior start study drug administration . In addition , surgical complication must resolve , surgical scar must determine surgeon heal appropriately Patients must recover uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection Patients may follow within 6 month prior study drug administration : MI , severe/unstable angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , symptomatic CHF , CVA , TIA PE Patients may grade 3 hemorrhage within 4 week study drug administration Patients may history active spinal cord compression carcinomatous meningitis . In addition , previous brain metastasis adequately treat , evidence new brain leptomeningeal metastasis screen CT MRI scan Patients may ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias grade ≥2 . In addition , may prolong QTc interval baseline EKG Patients may uncontrolled hypertension thyroid disease Patients may severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality Patients must adequate bone marrow function define absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3 , Hgb ≥ 9g/dl platelet count ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3 Patients must adequate liver function define bilirubin &lt; =2 x upper limit institutional normal SGOT SGPT &lt; =2.5 x upper limit institutional normal , SGOT SGPT &lt; =5 x upper limit institutional normal liver function abnormality due underlying malignancy Patients must adequate renal function define serum creatinine &lt; =1.5 x upper limit institutional normal Patients must serum calcium ≤12.0 mg/dL No previous history severe hypersensitivity reaction attribute receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor . For patient reproductive potential , use adequate contraception require duration treatment 3 month follow treatment Pregnant nursing woman eligible After informed treatment involve , patient must give write consent .
