	<brief_summary>The goal study determine safety efficacy Prednisolone Vincristine treatment large , complicate infantile hemangioma . The diagnostic , therapeutic response criterion experimentally determine study use framework future infantile hemangioma study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Vincristine vs. Prednisolone Treatment Complicated Hemangiomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infants large hemangioma often treat systemically oral steroid ( Prednisolone ) prevent complication . The best treatment hemangioma know medication approve FDA treatment hemangioma . Also , best method measure response hemangioma treatment know . Patients enrol study randomly assign receive either daily Prednisolone mouth weekly Vincristine vein . Response treatment monitor clinical exam every two week MRI study entry six twelve week later . Patients evidence progressive disease ( large hemangioma ) week 6 MRI switch drug complete total 12 week therapy . Side effect medication monitor closely determined history , physical exam , blood test study necessary . Participation study last 12 week follow protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Children age 06 month old . Infants infantile hemangiomas complication require systemic therapy control growth . To eligible enrollment infant must clear indication systemic treatment . Clinical diagnosis infantile hemangioma confirm tissue biopsy positive GLUT1 Immunohistochemical staining . If risk bleed permanent disfigurement biopsy believe great clinical radiological characteristic may use establish diagnosis discussion study PI . Patients GLUT1 negative vascular tumor Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma , tufted angioma , angiosarcoma eligible . Hemangiomas must great equal 50 cm2 clinically measure take product two large perpendicular diameter one follow complication : ulceration , impairment vision , impairment hearing , obstruction airway , high output cardiac failure , bleeding , abdominal distention and/or compartment syndrome , compression spinal cord , high risk permanent disfigurement . Adequate liver function define : Total bilirubin â‰¤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) age , SGPT ( serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase ) ( ALT ) &lt; 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) age . Patients receive topical intralesional corticosteroid eligible enrol . A washout one week require prior study enrollment . Patients undergone surgical resection eligible meet inclusion criterion surgery . All patient ' parent legal guardian must sign write informed consent . All institutional FDA requirement human study must meet . Children great 6 month old . Contraindications Vincristine : previously diagnose neuropathy include sensory neuropathy type 1 , Charcot MarieTooth childhood poliomyelitis . Hemangioma involve central nervous system ( CNS ) Vincristine poor CNS penetration . Infants receive prior systemic therapy corticosteroid ( oral intravenous ) , interferon Vincristine eligible enrollment . Patients receive Vincristine concomitantly require oral steroid treatment nonhemangioma indication asthma atopic dermatitis remove study . A lifethreatening intercurrent infection . Infants underlie illness would require use general anesthesia ( opposed sedation ) MRI .</criteria>
