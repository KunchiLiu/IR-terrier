	<brief_title>Forced Air Versus Endovascular Warming Polytrauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trauma lead cause death young adult major cause morbidity mortality age . The acute problem often uncontrollable bleed . Subsequently , infection becomes lead cause morbidity . Polytrauma patient high risk accidental hypothermia . Mild perioperative hypothermia cause coagulopathy significantly augments blood loss increase allogeneic transfusion requirement . Hypothermia also impair numerous immune function - even slight decrease core temperature triple risk surgical wound infection . Endovascular temperature management system Alsius® ( ICY , Alsius Corporation : Irvine , California , USA ) approve Europe United States past 10 year use thousand patient mainly indication therapeutic cooling subsequently rewarming patient . A major potential advantage system heat directly add thermal core , thus bypass heat sink insulate effect peripheral tissue . The efficacy system sufficient allow rapid rewarming hypothermic trauma victim , even undergo major surgery . We therefore propose test hypothesis polytrauma patient rewarmed Alsius® system well patient outcome ( combine perioperative morbidity ) warm conventionally forced-air .</detailed_description>
