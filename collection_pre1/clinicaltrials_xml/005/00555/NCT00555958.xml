	<brief_summary>To determine safety , efficacy treatment algorithm ( ) Maestro System cause weight loss obese subject - This study provide feasibility data regard potential intra-abdominal vagus nerve down-regulation/block treatment obesity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vagal Blocking Obesity Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development innovative , safe effective therapeutic option treatment obese patient desirable necessary . Gastric bypass operation usually effective short- long-term also available desire many obese people variety reason . Gastric banding procedure also available report less effective gastric bypass operation . Diets , exercise program pharmaceutical agent offer short-term effectiveness obese patient often ineffective long term . The ever increase impact obesity morbidity , mortality accelerate healthcare resource utilization develop country well document . Activation up-regulation efferent afferent fiber intra-abdominal vagal nerve trunk pivotal physiological mechanism food ingestion , mechanical processing , enzymatic digestion calorie absorption . EnteroMedics ' Maestroâ„¢ System design take therapeutic benefit physiological principle reversibly controllably down-regulating/blocking anterior posterior intra-abdominal vagal trunk order : ( 1 ) reduce food intake reduce gastric volume ; ( 2 ) initiate early prolonged satiation delay gastric emptying ; , ( 3 ) decrease calorie absorption down-regulating pancreatic exocrine secretion digestion . This multi-modal mechanism implement order achieve predictable controllable loss body weight . This prospective , open-label , multi-center , clinical trial subject ' baseline parameter control . Subjects implant laparoscopically Maestro System follow 6-months two year . - Implantable component : two flexible lead ( include one electrode anterior posterior intra-abdominal vagal nerve trunk ) connect implantable neuroregulator place subcutaneously abdominal wall costal margin ( minimum two three finger width ) , location determine surgeon consistent device operation . - External component : - For Maestro System use neuroregulator internal rechargeable battery : one mobile charger implant neuroregulator , connect via small , flexible cable cutaneous transmit coil position implanted neuroregulator charge device determine status device ; software program laptop computer transmits information neuroregulator upload data neuroregulator , available clinician , allow change treatment regimens assessment treatment compliance . - For Maestro System use neuroregulator battery : one programmable , battery-powered ambulatory controller connect via small , flexible cable cutaneous transmit coil position implanted neuroregulator provide power device ; software program laptop computer transmits information uploads data controller available clinician , allow change treatment regimens assessment treatment compliance . The objective trial follow : - Determination efficacy quantification excess body weight loss ( EWL ) 4 12 week , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 60 month . - Evaluation safety 4 12 week , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 60 month . - Selection effective daily treatment regimen ( ) .</detailed_description>
