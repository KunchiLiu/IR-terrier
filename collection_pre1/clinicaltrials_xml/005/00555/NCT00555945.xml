	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess impact Gamma3 intramedullary nail versus slide hip screws rate revision surgery individual inter-trochanteric fracture . Secondary outcome include fracture heal rate , fracture related complication , health-related quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Re-Evaluation GAmma3 Intramedullary Nails Hip Fracture ( REGAIN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip fracture become prevalent issue worldwide , lead profound morbidity , case , mortality . Currently common method surgical treatment include use slide hip screw Gamma intramedullary nail , conflict evidence regard device low revision surgery rate complication rate . The new generation Gamma3 nail strong rationale suggest significantly decrease rate femoral shaft fracture improve function . The improvement implant design Gamma3 nail provide compel rationale conduct large , definitive trial , therefore pilot study conduct confirm refute ability recruit patient assess consistency site estimate actual recruitment , determine degree site investigator adhere trial protocol , confirm refute anticipate ability achieve close 100 % follow- , assess ability maintain 100 % data quality , field test case report form clarity appropriateness , determine whether successfully manage logistics coordinate trial activity across multiple site . This trial pilot , multi-center , conceal randomize control trial . Surgeons use one two surgical strategy patient sustain trochanteric fracture ; Gamma3 intramedullary nail slide hip screw . Clinical assessment occur time hospital admission , 1 week , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult men woman age 50 year old ( upper age limit ) . An trochanteric fracture ( stable unstable ) confirm anterior posterior lateral hip radiograph , compute tomography , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Operative treatment within 3 day ( i.e. , 72 hour ) trauma . Patient ambulatory prior fracture , though may use aid cane walker . Anticipated medical optimization patient operative fixation proximal femur . Provision inform consent patient proxy . Low energy fracture ( defined fall stand height ) . No major trauma . Associated major injury low extremity ( i.e. , ipsilateral contralateral fracture foot , ankle , tibia , fibula , knee , femur ; dislocation ankle , knee , hip ; femoral head defect fracture ) . Retained hardware around affected hip . Infection around hip ( i.e. , soft tissue bone ) . Patients disorder bone metabolism osteoporosis ( i.e. , Paget 's disease , renal osteodystrophy , osteomalacia ) . Moderate severe cognitively impaired patient ( i.e. , Six Item Screener three error ) . Patients Parkinson 's disease ( dementia ) severe enough increase likelihood fall severe enough compromise rehabilitation . Likely problem , judgment investigator , maintain followup . We , example , exclude patient fixed address , report plan move town next year , intellectually challenge patient without adequate family support . If attend surgeon believe patient exclude REGAIN patient enrol another ongoing drug surgical intervention trial . If attend surgeon believe another reason exclude patient REGAIN . This reason document case report form .</criteria>
