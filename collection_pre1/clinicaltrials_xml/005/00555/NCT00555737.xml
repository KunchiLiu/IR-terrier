	<brief_title>Performance Evaluation Capsule Endoscopy Diagnosis Gluten Sensitive Enteropathy ( MA-23 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gluten-sensitive enteropathy ( GSE ) , also know celiac disease , characterize abnormal small intestinal mucosa arise consequence inappropriate inflammatory response ingest gluten susceptible individual . These change cause loss absorptive capacity turn lead variable degree malabsorption . A person suffer celiac may symptoms range mild iron deficiency anemia severe diarrhea weight loss . Characteristically , removal gluten diet follow resolution mucosal change symptom . Celiac disease suspect basis clinical sign symptom , generally confirm serological test small bowel biopsy . Patients suspect celiac disease undergo upper GI endoscopy mucosal biopsy duodenum , order detect characteristic histological change . Although main role endoscopy GSE obtain tissue histological examination , variety endoscopic change describe patient , nodularity mucosa 'scalloping ' loss duodenal mucosal fold . The GivenÂ® Diagnostic System visually investigate small bowel , produce high-quality image mucosa , might able detect villous atrophy thus could use assessment patient GSE . Whereas upper GI endoscopy invasive , often require sedation may uncomfortable , Capsule Endoscopy less invasive , convenient use require sedation . Capsule Endoscopy could become important tool non-invasive assessment small bowel mucosa GSE .</detailed_description>
