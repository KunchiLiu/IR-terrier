	<brief_summary>We develop safe , non-contact , intra-operative guidance system optimize tumor resection neurosurgery . The Modulated Imaging non-contact optical imaging technology develop Beckman Laser Institute , UCI . Compared image approach , MI unique capability perform diffuse optical tomography rapid , wide-field quantitative mapping tissue optical property within single measurement platform . Preliminary vivo study show brain tumor , infiltrate tumor margin normal brain may intrinsically different optical property .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While compatible time-modulation method , MI alternatively use spatially-modulated illumination image tissue constituent . The Modulated Imaging system consist 1. light projection system illuminate tissue spatial sinusoid pattern . 2. CCD camera collect diffusely reflect light non-contact geometry . The wavelength illumination select bandpass filter broadband source , use monochromatic source . Lastly , tissue fluorescence measurement perform place combination source-blocking bandpass emission filter front camera . The diffusely reflect amplitude modulate wave carry optical property ( absorption , fluorescence , scatter ) depth information . Specifically , sample depth spatially-modulated wave function frequency illumination tissue optical property . During neurosurgery nervous tissue expose attend neurosurgeon , intraoperative picture take use modulated imager investigator . The imaging procedure may delay completion surgical case estimate 10 20 minute . This minimal prolongation consider brain tumor resection take several hour . The image acquire processed surgical procedure available surgeon operative procedure .</detailed_description>
