	<brief_summary>If anesthetic regimen influence serum level inflammatory cytokine level cytokine relate incidence post operative complication , complication may function anesthetic method . In effort find best anesthetic regimen patient undergo craniotomy intracranial tumor , researcher compare effect volatile anesthetic total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) cytokine level . The researcher also compare composite incidence common major post-operative complication craniotomy intracranial malignancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Anesthesia Versus Anesthesia With Volatile Agents Elective Craniotomy Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize blind clinical trial . Patients randomize one two group . One group receive volatile anesthetic ( sevoflurane ) group receive intravenous anesthetic ( propofol + remifentanil ) maintenance General Anesthesia . The anesthesia team know result randomization induction . Postoperative data gather research personnel blind anesthetic method use . Patients blind anesthetic receive 4-week outcome collect , option unblinded . Peripheral blood sample take total 7 time ; pre-induction anesthesia , 15 minute surgical positioning , tumor extract , 6,12,18 , 24 hour emergence anesthesia . Patients call follow every week 4 week follow discharge .</detailed_description>
