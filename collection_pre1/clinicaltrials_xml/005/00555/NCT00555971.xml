	<detailed_description>This 24 week double-blind study consist 11 office visit people 18 year age aspirin exacerbate respiratory disease ( AERD ) . 21 subject participate randomize 2:1 receive Xolair ( Omalizumab ) placebo . 14 subject receive Xolair 7 receive placebo . Xolair FDA approve medication treatment moderate severe allergic asthma . Injections occur every 2-4 week , 16 week . The dosage base upon IgE body weight . Aspirin desensitization occur 1-3 week later . One month desensitization , final visit occur GCRC . Properly select patient aspirin exacerbate respiratory disease ( AERD ) experience benefit course disease aspirin desensitization treatment ; however , AERD patient risk potentially serious asthmatic reaction undergo aspirin desensitization . For reason , procedure currently perform monitor set . We hypothesize administration Xolair , monoclonal anti-IgE antibody , prior aspirin desensitization reduce severity aspirin-induced respiratory reaction , ultimately , use Xolair permit procedure perform safely outpatient setting . This protocol also entail obtain blood urine sample assess influence Xolair , compare placebo . As aspirin induce reaction occur via heighten release leukotrienes combine great end organ responsiveness mediator , also quantify impact prior administration Xolair , compare placebo , elevation urinary LTE4 association aspirin challenge aspirin provoke reaction .</detailed_description>
