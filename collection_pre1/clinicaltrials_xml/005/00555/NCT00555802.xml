	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy motor control exercise . For , motor control general exercise , determine transverses abdominis multifidus thickness , activity limitation pain . We hypothesize motor control exercise would increase transverses abdominis multifidus muscle thickness . Activity limitation pain would decrease follow two protocol motor control group general one .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Motor Control Exercise Versus General Exercise Lumbar Local Stabilizing Muscles Thickness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Musculoskeletal disorder , back pain account half number case , common cause chronic incapacity industrialize country . Approximately 10-20 percent patient low back pain develop chronic pain , define low back pain persist 3 month . Low back pain represent particularly costly sociomedical problem expenditure associate repeated treatment long-term absence work need social support . These patient use 80 % health care resource back problem , treatment low success rate . Thus , development effective intervention aim management chronic problem urgently require . Review study show effectiveness stabilization exercise patient nonspecific LBP yet fully establish . In clinical trial improvement report motor control exercise , intervention accompany exercise . Also , result motor control exercise study different . On hand , evidence underpins primary aim motor control exercise , re-establish normal control deep spinal muscle , reduce activity superficial muscle tend stiffen spine increase activity low back pain , maintain normal control progressively demand physical functional task . For reason , decide identify efficacy motor control exercise , usually consider specific trunk muscle stabilization exercise . A randomized control trial way identify role exercise treat chronic low back pain . Also , choice coincides research agenda set 2004 European Guideline .</detailed_description>
