	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Simulator Training Its Impact Surgical Education</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We design randomize control trial assess impact laparoscopic simulator curriculum operate room performance amongst gynecology resident . At begin study , resident chooses participate take multiple choice pre-test assess background knowledge laparoscopic surgical principle . Everyone listen series lecture / video demonstration teach fundamental laparoscopic surgery . The final part orientation resident perform 5 task laparoscopic simulator ( peg transfer , endoloop , pattern cutting , intracorporeal suturing , extracorporeal suture ) proctor faculty member time task record error make . Each resident 2 proctored performance ( pre- post ) simulator set typical OSCE-type exam . We choose perform 2 repetition oppose usual 1 ( like MCAT , SAT , high stake exam ) allow potential unfamiliarity simulator equipment . The resident perform laparoscopic tubal ligation faculty member begin Benign Gynecology rotation . Each resident subsequently randomize either traditional teaching ( simulator ) five 30-minute faculty-directed session Laparoscopic Simulator Lab . Those randomized simulation training practice perform many repetition necessary simulator achieve proficiency . Prior complete rotation , resident perform another laparoscopic tubal ligation faculty member blind whether randomized simulator train re-assess technical skill . The resident another proctor examination simulator performance five task . Finally , videotape review independent observer verify precision surgical evaluation conclusion study .</detailed_description>
