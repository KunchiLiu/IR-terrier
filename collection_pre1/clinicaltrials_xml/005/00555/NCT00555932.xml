	<brief_summary>Our overall aim examine ultrasound accurate MRI and/or CT evaluation dural venous sinus . We hypothesize sonography accurate ( accuracy &gt; 80 % ) diagnose specific anatomic finding dural venous sinus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modern Ultrasound Techniques Evaluation Cerebral Venous Sinuses Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cranial ultrasound establish technique evaluation neonatal brain . However role evaluation cerebral dural venous sinus neonate establish . It important evaluate cerebral dural venous sinus , cerebral sinovenous thrombosis ( CSVT ) increasingly recognize condition neonate . There obvious clinical need systematically evaluate role ultrasound doppler evaluation cerebral venous sinus . Advances diagnostic image lead rapid clinical implementation new technology like MR CT evaluation venous sinus . However technological advance older image method like ultrasound advantage non-invasive perform bedside evaluate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . All neonate ( 28 day old ) preterm infant , hospitalize HSC need clinically indicate brain MR MRV part diagnostic workup . Clinical indication MR could include birth asphyxia , seizure , irritability , lethargy , abnormal neurological examination , etc . 2 . Neonates preterm infant &amp; clinically consider stable undergo ultrasound study . This determine bedside neonatology team attendance . 3 . Where consent available parent . 4 . Only neonates preterm infant undergone technically adequate MRI study include vascular MR venography sequence CT contrast include . Assessments technically adequacy make technologist supervise radiologist , per clinical protocol currently use department diagnostic imaging . This determined refer note make request form also direct communication supervise radiologist team member obtain consent . 1 . Vital sign monitor usual manner nurse attendance neonatal unit . If neonate unstable , ultrasound study do . 2 . If start ultrasound , sign instability note study , ultrasound study discontinue . 3 . If consent parent guardian available , research ultrasound study do . 4 . If ultrasound do within 10 hour window CT MR study ( due technical problem machine skilled personnel available ) . 5 . Neonates &amp; preterm infant undergone technically inadequate MR and/or CT include . Such technical inadequacy determine refer note make technologist request form direct communication supervise radiologist . 6 . Neonates &amp; preterm infant undergo repeat CT and/or MRs exclude study .</criteria>
