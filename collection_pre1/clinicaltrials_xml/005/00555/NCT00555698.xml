	<brief_summary>The purpose investigation obtain preliminary indication feasibility , safety efficacy capsular deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) treatment intractable depression . Also , learn new treatment severe depression improve enough despite long-term treatment medication behavior therapy . The new treatment call deep brain stimulation , DBS . In DBS , thin wire use carry electric current part brain think involved produce depression symptom . Two wire implant surgically , attach battery pack implant skin new chest collar bone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility , Safety Efficacy Deep Brain Stimulation Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol propose pilot/feasibility clinical study therapeutic benefit ventral capsule/ventral striatum deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) treatment ten patient intractable major depression ( MD ) . Conservative estimate place MD 's prevalence 2.6 % 5.5 % men 6.0 % 11.8 % woman . Most conservative study estimate 20 % complete refractoriness medical psychotherapeutic regimen . Given prevalence major depression general population , 3.5 million Americans would expect manifest refractory illness depression receive treatment . Study subject MD disable severity , intractable prolonged treatment attempt conventional medication pschotherapies . They must also electroconvulsive therapy . These refractory patient would candidate destructive/lesioning brain surgery radiofrequency cingulotomy . These MD patient analogous medically intractable Parkinson 's disease tremor patient recently underwent similar destructive surgery pallidotomy thalamotomy . The use DBS technology inherent advantage fully reversible adjustable become standard care disabled patient . Studies demonstrate improved safety efficacy DBS lesioning . Recently , DBS technology employ lesioning target anterior limb internal capsule OCD . These preliminary study Europe US , demonstrate improve outcome refractory OCD patient regard OC symptom well depressed mood . This amelioration mood provide basis anterior internal capsule DBS may help major depression patient . Based rationale , believe DBS viable therapeutic surgical option group severely ill MD patient . The standard DBS stereotactic surgical technique employ CCF team hundred movement disorder patient use . The DBS electrode implant bilaterally anterior limb internal capsule connect subcutaneously subclavicular programmable pulse generator .</detailed_description>
