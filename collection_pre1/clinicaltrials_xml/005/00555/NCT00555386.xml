	<brief_title>Soy , Selenium Breast Cancer Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The high incidence breast cancer , relatively long development phase financial burden NHS relation treatment make prime target dietary preventative strategy . Epidemiological experimental investigation suggest several key dietary component may reduce breast cancer , particular isoflavones selenium . Few dietary intervention study conduct investigate putative protective effect , grow understanding cancer biology application new -omics technology possible use early biomarkers risk assess potential efficacy intervention study . In pilot project , employ combination discipline examine effect dietary intervention group woman define NICE guideline increase risk ( moderate-high ) develop breast cancer , use metabolomics assess tractability biomarkers response dietary intervention . Such trial urgently need examine protective effect diet woman classify increase risk still 'zone reversibility ' . The result study used justify optimise large scale intervention trial ultimately develop appropriate dietary recommendation prevention breast cancer . A dietary intervention study base randomise double-blind parallel design conduct 30 pre-menopausal woman ( age 35-50 ) moderate high risk develop breast cancer . The metabolomic profile urine serum sample ( collect baseline dietary intervention ) assess . Participants randomise two group ; placebo group ( consume 6g non-supplemented chocolate per day ) supplement group ( consume 6g chocolate contain soy selenium per day ) . The intervention last duration one menstrual cycle .</detailed_description>
