	<brief_summary>Pseudoxanthoma elasticum disease frequency estimate 1/50000 1/100 000 . There female preponderance sex-ratio 2:1 . PXE transmit accord either autosomal dominant mode autosomal recessive one . Mutations ABCC6 gene chromosome 16p13.1 recently identify causing PXE . The elastic fiber slowly become mineralize mainly skin , eye , cardiovascular system . PXE multisystem disease include spectrum clinical manifestation affect skin , eye cardiovascular system well tissues . It responsible severe life threaten complication . Skin change usually first manifestation begin early childhood . The vital prognosis PXE depend severity cardiovascular lesion could responsible sudden death child young adult . Ocular manifestation quite constant include chorioretinal scarring , pigmentary change angioid streak . The natural evolution angioid streak lead enlargement occurrence subfoveal choroidal neovascularizations hemorrhage leave macular scare . A self-monitoring recommend since early treatment subfoveal CNV way minimize pejorative consequence . The gold standard treatment CNV consist photocoagulation . New therapeutic develop include photodynamic therapy intravitreal injection anti-angiogenic agent seem effective reduce immediate complication limit CNV . This evolution explain 50 70 % patient poor vision legal blindness one eye . However , little known age occurrence visual impairment PXE patient . That reason decide review ophthalmologic status visual history population PXE patient accord age .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A retrospective review case PXE patient refer Department Genetics perform . This ophthalmologic examination conduct part usual follow PXE patient need treatment complication angioid streak CNV complication . As studied age poor vision occurrence , propose take account first examination best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) 20/50 observe . All past medical event obtain data patient record , especially ophthalmologic one .</detailed_description>
