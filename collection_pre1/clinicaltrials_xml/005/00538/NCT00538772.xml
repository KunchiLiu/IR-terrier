	<detailed_description>It recognize measurable disease RECIST criterion response rate mTOR inhibition likely low benefit therapy also include effect disease stabilization . Disease stabilization difficult interpret phase II setting . Thus , desirable develop biomarkers provide additional information novel treatment effect might relate disease progression</detailed_description>
