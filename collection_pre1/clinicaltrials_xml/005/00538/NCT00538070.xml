	<brief_summary>The NMDA receptor identify role substance use disorder well schizophrenia . One example former nicotine 's effect dopaminergic activity increase release dopamine Midbrain reward center , also less direct mechanism affect alpha-7 nicotinic receptor , NMDA receptor , Glycine , co-agonist NMDA receptor . In term schizophrenia , hypothesize NMDA receptor hypofunction play role mechanism negative symptom cognitive dysfunction patient . The NMDA hypofunction may reverse increase synaptic glycine availability . Sarcosine , n-methyl-glycine , GlyT-1 System A transport inhibitor action could expect increase availability glycine , synaptic space . Sarcosine dietary supplement could find several food item egg yolk turkey . Our collaborative team develop novel , non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) technique measure brain glycine change allow u study glycine homeostasis . The purpose study explore effect sarcosine ( n-methyl-glycine ) brain glycine concentration . It hypothesis oral sarcosine , dose 2 gram per day , well tolerate associate increased brain glycine concentration . It secondary exploratory hypothesis increase brain glycine associate behavioral sign increase NMDA dopamine activity . This modulation could future therapeutic potential disorder hedonic cognitive function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research subject undergo screen visit Massachusetts General Hospital Center Addiction Medicine . If meet inclusion criterion , invite baseline visit first MRS begin take study drug/placebo . The randomization do block four . The study drug/placebo prescribe take 2 capsule 500 mg , two time per day , without food . They continue weekly visit six week receive new supply study drug/placebo week 2 4 . On week 6 , second MRS. On week 8 16 , subject undergo follow visit . On several visit , study staff ass presence adverse event ( UKU instrument ) , cigarettes use ( carbon monoxide monitoring ) , abnormal involuntary movement ( abnormal involuntary movement scale , barnes akathisia scale , sympson angus scale ) .</detailed_description>
