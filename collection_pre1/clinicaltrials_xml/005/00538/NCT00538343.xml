	<brief_title>RTA 744 Breast Cancer Patients With Progression Previously Irradiated Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RTA 744 novel , anthracycline show ability circumvent ATP-binding cassette transporter ( Multidrug Resistance Protein 1 , Breast Cancer Resistance Protein , P-glycoprotein ) vitro . This action enable RTA 744 penetrate across blood brain barrier . In Phase I safety study , RTA 744 show generally well tolerated patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . Additionally , anti-tumor activity observe . Breast cancer know sensitive anthracycline therapy . Based preliminary Phase I clinical result sensitivity breast cancer anthracycline therapy , Phase II study investigate safety efficacy RTA 744 patient breast cancer metastatic disease brain progress following whole brain irradiation .</detailed_description>
