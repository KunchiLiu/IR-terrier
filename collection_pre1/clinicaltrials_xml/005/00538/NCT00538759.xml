	<brief_title>Radiation Following Percutaneous Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty Prevent Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The RADAR trial prospective , randomize , double-blind , sham-controlled , two-stage , adaptive clinical trial . Following successful Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty , patient severe aortic stenosis randomize 2:1 fashion External Beam Radiation Therapy ( EBRT ) plus standard medical therapy standard medical therapy along sham EBRT ( placebo ) . During Stage One , approximately 110 patient enrol order 80 patient randomize 66 patient valid 6 month data . The sample size Stage Two calculate end Stage One . At time study commencement , expectation total sample size approximately 155 patient valid 6-month data , thus 195 randomize 250 enrol . Patients follow period two ( 2 ) year . Echocardiographic clinical endpoint data collect analyzed .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Calcific aortic valve stenosis echocardiographically derive AV index less 0.45 cm2/m2 . Any symptom severe AS , include near syncope/syncope , angina , excessive fatigue and/or shortness breath NYHA functional class IIIV limitation . Age great 75 risk aortic valve replacement surgery great equal 15 percent . This may assess use STS Risk Predictor ( see appendix C ) , confirm consultation cardiac surgeon experience high risk aortic valve surgery OR cardiac surgeon experience high risk aortic valve surgery document comorbid condition ( porcelain aorta , malnutrition comorbidities capture STS score system ) make risk great equal 15 percent estimation surgeon . If age great equal 90 cardiac surgeon experience high risk aortic valve surgery must document BAV good option patient aortic valve replacement surgery . Probable survival great 6 month successful valvuloplasty . Patient competent , willing comply followup , understands risk , benefit alternative sign Informed Consent form . Patient undergone previous BAV AVR . Patient undergo BAV bridge AVR . 4 plus ( severe ) Aortic insufficiency echocardiogram obtain prior plan BAV procedure . Known congenital AV abnormality ( e.g. , bicuspid AV ) . ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI ) associate CKMB great equal 3 time ULN stroke less equal 6 week prior plan BAV procedure . Bacterial endocarditis less equal 1 year prior plan BAV procedure . Left ventricular ejection fraction le 30 % preprocedural echocardiography . Baseline mean AV gradient le 30 mm Hg echocardiogram unless associate leave ventricular ejection fraction le 40 per cent true severe AS confirm dobutamine stress echocardiogram , i.e. , AVA index less equal 0.45cm2/m2 peak dobutamine infusion . See Appendix D suggest protocol . Patients achieve successful BAV perform part RADAR Trial : success define improvement 424 hour postvalvuloplasty echocardiographicallyderived AVA great 35 per cent baseline AVA great equal 0.7 cm2 absence 4+ plus AI . Percutaneous Coronary Intervention drug elute stent placement less equal 6 month prior plan BAV procedure bare metal stent placement/balloon angioplasty less equal 8 week prior plan BAV procedure . Cardiogenic shock , define consistent systolic blood pressure le 80 mm Hg vasopressor less 90 mm Hg vasopressor . Patients require ventilator support less equal 48 hour prior plan BAV procedure . Creatinine great 2.2 mg/dL less equal 48 hour prior plan BAV procedure . Platelet count less equal 100,000/mm3 less equal 48 hour prior plan BAV procedure . Hemoglobin le equal 9.0 gm/dL less equal 48 hour prior plan BAV procedure . Known allergy/sensitivity ASA . Known allergy/sensitivity clopidogrel ticlopidine . Gastrointestinal bleed require transfusion less equal 2 week prior plan BAV procedure . Prior external beam radiation therapy chest , judgment radiation oncologist , compromise patient safety interfere interpretation study result . This include prior radiation thoracic content , except radiation treatment malignant benign lesion skin . Untreated pneumonia systemic infection associate fever great 38.5Ëšc WBC count great 10,000 less equal 72 hour prior plan BAV procedure . Concomitant medical illness ( example , terminal malignancy ) opinion investigator associate reduce survival less 6 month . Major surgery less equal 2 week prior plan BAV procedure . Any illness condition , Investigator 's judgment , interfere patient 's ability comply protocol , compromise patient safety , interfere interpretation study result . Involvement study investigational drug , device procedure less equal 30 day prior plan BAV procedure . Previous enrollment study .</criteria>
