	<brief_title>Obatoclax Bortezomib Treating Patients With Aggressive Relapsed Recurrent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose obatoclax mesylate administer bortezomib patient aggressive relapsed recurrent non-Hodgkin lymphoma . II . To describe toxicity regimen dose studied patient . III . To characterize pharmacokinetic behavior regimen patient . IV . To obtain preliminary information regard effect obatoclax mesylate several apoptotic regulatory pathway . V. To document clinical response patient regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . PHASE I : Patients receive obatoclax mesylate IV 3 hour follow bortezomib IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 35 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Pharmacokinetic evaluation obatoclax mesylate conduct patient first course . PHASE II : Patients receive obatoclax mesylate IV 3 hour follow bortezomib IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 maximum tolerate dose determined phase I . Treatment repeat every 35 day 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 26 week .</detailed_description>
