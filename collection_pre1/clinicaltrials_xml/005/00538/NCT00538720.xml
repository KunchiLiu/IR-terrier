	<brief_title>Effects Vitamin D Replacement Patients With Primary Hyperparathyroidism ( PHPT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Vitamin : In patient PHPT Vitamin D deficiency , Vitamin D supplement routinely give bring Vitamin D blood level normal level surgery abnormal parathyroid gland . When patient Vitamin D deficiency , absorb calcium well , parathyroid gland work harder . This may cause parathyroid gland become large . Baseline : If find eligible take part study , part routine standard care , 4-dimensional compute tomography ( 4DCT ) scan neck . This 4DCT use find size location parathyroid glands help surgeon planning surgery . Vitamin D Administration : You receive Vitamin D pill take home , mouth . You take Vitamin D time day . If cause upset stomach , take food . You give study diary record day take Vitamin D pill . You return diary end cycle . Cycle 1 : During Cycle 1 ( first 3 week study , +/- 1 week ) , take 3 Vitamin D pill per week every day ( example , Mondays , Wednesdays , Fridays ) . At end Cycle 1 , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check Vitamin D level . If Vitamin D level high enough first Cycle 1 study visit , repeat Cycle 1 dose schedule second time . At end second Cycle 1 dose schedule , another blood test ( 1 teaspoon ) check Vitamin D level . If Vitamin D level high enough , take study . If Vitamin D level high enough either first second Cycle 1 dose schedule , go Cycle 2 . Cycle 2 : During Cycle 2 , dose schedule Vitamin D 2 pill per week 6 week ( +/- 1 week ) . You try take pill day week . At end Cycle 2 , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check Vitamin D level . If Vitamin D level high enough first Cycle 2 study visit , repeat Cycle 2 dose schedule second time . At end second Cycle 2 dose schedule , another blood test ( 1 teaspoon ) check Vitamin D level . If Vitamin D level high enough , take study . If Vitamin D level high enough either first second Cycle 2 dose schedule , go Cycle 3 . Cycle 3 : During Cycle 3 , dose schedule Vitamin D 2 pill per week 6 week ( +/- 1 week ) . At end Cycle 3 , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check Vitamin D level . If Vitamin D level high enough , another 4DCT scan neck , purpose research study . This second scan use see parathyroid gland change size . Before second scan , blood ( 1/2 teaspoon ) drawn check kidney function . If Vitamin D level high enough , take study . Routine Surgical Treatment : Within 3 week second 4DCT scan , routine surgery PHPT perform . You sign separate consent form risk describe detail time . Your removed parathyroid gland examine . Length Study : Your active participation study surgery . If side effect PHPT indicate may need parathyroid surgery earlier , take study early surgery soon possible . This investigational study . Vitamin D supplement commercially available FDA approve use patient PHPT Vitamin D deficiency bring Vitamin D blood level normal surgery . It consider experimental second 4DCT scan Vitamin D level high enough . Up 22 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
