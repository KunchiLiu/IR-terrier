	<brief_summary>We propose low tidal volume ventilation proven beneficial patient establish ARDS may role prevent onset acute lung injury cardiac surgical population . Institution low tidal volume ventilation operate room may reduce release cytokine interleukin know contribute development acute lung injury . In study , propose institution low tidal volume ventilation operate room reduce incidence acute lung injury . Measurement PaO2 FiO2 ratio twenty four forty eight hour post operatively help determine difference oxygenation two group . Chest X-ray finding , time extubation length ICU stay also determine role low tidal volume ventilation operate room . We also attempt establish causative mechanism measure plasma level cytokine know associated development ARDS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods- A single center randomize controlled trial undertaken 149 patient compare ventilation 6 ml/kg TV ventilation 10 ml/kg TV patient undergo elective cardiac surgery . Study ventilator setting apply immediately induction anesthesia continue throughout surgery subsequent Intensive Care Unit stay . The primary endpoint study time extubation . Secondary endpoint include proportion patient extubated 6 hour , index lung mechanic gas exchange well patient clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
