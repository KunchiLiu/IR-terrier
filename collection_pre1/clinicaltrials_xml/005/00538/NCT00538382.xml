	<detailed_description>Annually , approximately 25 million African woman become pregnant risk Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection pregnancy [ WHO ] . The adverse effect malaria pregnancy include increase risk maternal anemia , low birth weight ( LBW ) infant death . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend intermittent preventive treatment ( IPT ) malaria use routinely pregnant woman live area Africa malaria infection endemic . IPT involve periodic presumptive administration antimalarial treatment pregnant woman part routine antenatal care . This strategy proven effective much sub-Saharan Africa diagnostic facility often unavailable pregnant woman high risk malaria infection [ WHO 2005 ] . This representative study site Kinshasa , Democratic Republic Congo ( DRC ) , 2004 pilot study conduct Global Network Women 's Children 's Health Research ( GN ) reveal prevalence malaria pregnant woman 34.3 % [ personal communication , Tshefu ] . Currently sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) WHO-recommended drug prevention malaria pregnancy transmission Plasmodium falciparum malaria stable resistance SP low . The DRC area stable malaria transmission . In stable area transmission , non-pregnant adult high level immunity malaria usually become severely ill infection . However , pregnant woman , especially primigravidas , increased susceptibility malaria . Pregnant woman protect immunity acquire non-pregnant state parasite expose different antigen pregnancy non-pregnant state . In addition , Plasmodium falciparum infection pregnancy lead anemia affect placental nutrient transport , result birth low birth weight infant increase risk infant mortality [ Steketee , 2001 ] . In 2004 pilot study conduct Global Network two large maternity clinic Kinshasa , DRC , 34.3 % ( 182/530 ) pregnant woman thick smear positive malaria [ personal communication , Tshefu ] . Currently , Kinshasa , DRC standard care IPT treatment malaria pregnancy administer 1500 mg sulfadoxine 75 mg pyrimethamine second trimester ( fourth month usually association mother 's report fetal quicken ) third trimester , 28-32 week gestation . SP proven safe use IPT pregnant woman ; clinical study show serious adverse event case kernicterus significant difference rate spontaneous abortion , premature delivery , neonatal death IPT/SP intervention [ Newman , 2004 ] . Since 1980 's , SP resistance Africa Asia steadily increase . The 1999-2000 data East African Network Monitoring Anti-malarial Treatment indicate vivo SP failure sit Kenya great 25 % reach 45 % one site Tanzania . Focal area low- moderate-level SP resistance exist throughout Africa [ Bilj , 2000 ; Deloron 1989 ; Landgraf , 1994 ; Nizla , 2000 ] . Resistance likely progress geographically rapidly nothing do interrupt course . One reason increasingly high SP failure rate may recently observe cross-resistance SP cotrimoxazole ( sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim ) Plasmodium falciparum [ Lyer , 2001 ] . A second possible reason long half-life drug may result prolonged maintenance subtherapeutic concentration drug plasma [ Nzila , 2000 ] . Resistance Plasmodium falciparum SP Kinshasa appear low , verge increase selective pressure . In 2000 , vivo drug efficacy trial child find 94.5 % subject respond adequately SP [ Kazadi , 2003 ] . These result corroborate genotyping clinical sample pregnant woman 2004 pilot study conduct Global Network Kinshasa molecular marker drug resistance [ personal communication , Tshefu ] . Molecular marker use survey development evolution drug resistance . SP resistance associate mutation gene DHFR DHPS . Presence quintuplet mutation ( 51 , 59 , 108 , 437 , 540 ) strongly associate SP resistance . Only 4.1 % clinical sample pilot study contain quintuplet mutation , suggest drug resistance minimal time study conduct . However , 33.2 % sample find one mutation away quintuplet mutation , indicate full SP resistance ( 5 mutation ) likely occur soon . Therefore , adequate selective pressure apply , e.g . widespread use SP , currently practice DRC , prevalence quintuplet mutation treatment failure due drug resistance would increase dramatically . Drug resistance SP spread rapidly eastern part DRC , 2000 kilometer ( km ) Kinshasa . A report 2001 vivo drug efficacy study Bukavu , locate Rwandan border Eastern DRC , report 85.0 % child respond adequately SP [ Kazadi , 2003 ] ; however , subsequent drug efficacy study Rutshuru , also locate Rwanda/Uganda border Eastern DRC approximately 200 km south Bukavu , demonstrate 39.4 % child respond adequately treatment [ Kazadi , personal communication ] . In addition , 43.4 % clinical sample contain quintuplet mutation [ Alker , personal communication ] . Given rise resistance SP eastern DRC likelihood increase resistance Kinshasa , necessary begin explore alternative SP . While pharmacokinetics artemisinin well know non-pregnant adult , little know specific pharmacokinetics artemisinin pregnant woman , particularly pregnant woman develop country . Dosages drug often need adjust physiological metabolic change associate pregnancy . The aim study determine appropriate dosage artesunate use pregnant woman order begin investigate artesunate artesunate combination option IPT .</detailed_description>
