	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Cetuximab may also stop growth colorectal cancer block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving cetuximab together capecitabine may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give cetuximab together capecitabine work treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab Capecitabine Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer That Failed Irinotecan Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine response rate patient metastatic colorectal cancer treat cetuximab capecitabine progress prior fluoropyrimidine-containing therapy comprise irinotecan without oxaliplatin . Secondary - To determine progression-free survival overall survival patient treat regimen . - To determine tolerance therapy patient . - To assess biological correlate response available tissue biopsy blood sample . OUTLINE : Patients receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo tumor tissue blood collection periodically correlative study . Samples analyze expression gene correlate fluoropyrimidine responsiveness via quantitation RT-PCR ; degree expression EGFR via immunohistochemistry ; expression pattern analysis via gene expression profile polymorphism . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
