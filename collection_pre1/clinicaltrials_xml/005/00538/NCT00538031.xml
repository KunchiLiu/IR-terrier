	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Celecoxib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving cyclophosphamide together celecoxib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well give cyclophosphamide together celecoxib work compare cyclophosphamide alone treat patient recurrent persistent ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide With Without Celecoxib Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Ovarian Epithelial , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate patient recurrent persistent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer treat oral cyclophosphamide alone oral cyclophosphamide celecoxib . II . To assess time disease progression group patient . III . To describe toxicity oral cyclophosphamide without celecoxib patient population . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide daily oral celecoxib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
