	<brief_title>Feasibility Pilot Efficacy Flash-heated Breast Milk Reduce Maternal-to-Child-Transmission HIV Tanzania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive mother develop country exclusively breastfeed first month infant 's life follow early cessation , unless breast milk substitute acceptable , feasible , affordable , sustainable , safe . The weaning period high risk infant due lack adequate replacement feed result malnutrition , growth falter susceptibility diarrheal respiratory illness loss breast milk 's immune protection introduction contaminate food water . In addition , risk HIV transmission increase mother breastfeeds wean due high breast milk viral load time . Appropriate infant feed alternative high-risk weaning period urgently need . Although heat-treating breast milk list WHO one method modify breast milk , fully explore . Our preliminary data demonstrate Flash-heat , low-technologic home pasteurization method , capable inactivate HIV infect breast milk maintain vitamin immunoglobulin . This suggest Flash-heating breast milk could potential infant feeding option wean decrease risk infant illness malnutrition . Clinical staffing shortage much Africa , however , limit ability doctor , nurse counselor provide comprehensive infant feed counsel mother . In light , study investigate use enhance peer-based infant feed counsel practical approach improve exclusive breastfeeding duration investigate feasibility Flash-heating breast milk . We collaborate US Tanzania office University Research Co , LLC ( URC ) , forefront implement appropriate infant feed counsel method Africa . We work URC , local investigator , Anna Coutsoudis , 's Safer Breastfeeding Programme South Africa consider model , provide community health worker comprehensive infant feed counsel training . HIV positive mother ( small number HIV negative/status unknown mother avoid stigmatize home-based counseling ) breastfeeding recruit 1-2 month postpartum hospital Tanzania provide enhanced counseling exclusively breastfeed . Trained community health worker make weekly home visit support mother collect infant feeding breast pathology data . When HIV positive mother anticipate introduction complementary food , Flash-heat method discuss option transition . Mothers choose Flash-heat provide home-based support community health worker follow 3 month time stop breastfeeding . This feasibility pilot efficacy study Flash-heating breast milk use guide full-scale efficacy trial near future . Specific aim include : 1 ) Determine impact enhance home-based training infant feed outcome . Given clinical staffing shortage Tanzania , use community health worker could provide support need exclusively breastfeed long . Rates initiation duration exclusive breastfeeding measure . These finding important explore effective method thoroughly educate mother risk benefit various infant-feeding alternative increase burden face under-staffed health care worker . 2 ) Determine uptake Flash-heat method protocol adherence mother home . With enhanced support community health worker , mother may able correctly Flash-heat milk , suggest could practical infant feeding method . Uptake heat treatment duration successful heat treatment measure . We also interview mother opt attempt method qualitatively assess challenge mother may face field set . 3 ) Determine safety Flash-heated breast milk field set . Breast milk sample collect assayed HIV inactivation bacterial count ensure method safety field setting . 4 ) To pilot efficacy trial Flash-heat improve infant health outcome . Research personnel monitor infant feeding , growth morbidity home visit twice monthly . If infant receive heat-treated breast milk experience less morbidity mortality feed complementary food continue breastfeed completely wean replacement food , counselor future well able inform mother risk benefit different feeding option . If propose study find HIV positive mother successfully heat-treat breast milk , could view HIV-free , safe , nutritious , affordable available complementary food wean phase EBF .</detailed_description>
