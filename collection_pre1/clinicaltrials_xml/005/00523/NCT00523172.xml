	<brief_title>Clinical Assessment Two Manipulative Protocols Treatment Hip Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients seek treatment chiropractor ( OA ) . OA fifth report treated disorder medical practice . Osteoarthritis hip ( OAH ) , subset , affect ≥12 million American adult lead pain , loss mobility , decrease : function , strength , activity daily live , quality life significant risk factor fall . Medical care prescribe OAH lifestyle accommodation ( cane , high chair toilet seat , etc ) , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) , anti-arthritics , steroid , various sundry prescription non-prescription medication exercise . Randomized control trial ( RCTS ) support exercise knee OA ( KOA ) treatment , proven superior placebo , less OAH . Ninety-two percent patient OAH use NSAIDS . Frequent minor intermittently serious adverse reaction chronic use NSAIDS evidence manipulative/manual therapy ( MAN ) exercise/rehabilitation therapy may give equivalent relief , suggest NSAIDS infrequently use . Supported earlier RCT demonstrate manual , soft tissue exercise therapy KOA superior placebo ; later protocol find superior exercise . A similar multimodal ( multimodal = MAN 2 combine treatment ) 2004 RCT compare exercise protocol versus MAN combine passive active stretch OAH . Early , superior relief function achieve multimodal MAN . This suggest multimodal MAN ( manipulative ) therapy may superior treatment . In study follow multimodal MAN year ( without minimal , later , PRN supportive treatment give ) treatment benefit begin decrease toward similar mean ) . One feature frequently inherent previous trial design availability additional brief treatment round subsequent short course interventional therapy . Researchers typically design intervention search evaluate short-term interventional strategy sustain improvement symptom relief , function , QoL ( quality life ) achieve . The current investigator question utility approach . Frequently patient experience minor setback improvement secondary minor injury diminution compliance time exercise program . Combining practical awareness patient experience follow-up interval reality typically ongoing nature OA activity stimulate need reasonable level access follow-up care initial treatment course . A patient respond initial brief intervention course subsequently require occasional office visit physical re-evaluation , review exercise visit two manual method inherently synonymous fail interventional approach repeat dose pharmaceutical require chronic condition whether NSAIDs OA insulin diabetes . Significant morbidity occasional mortality NSAID drug-related complication surgery ; difficulty obtain compliance prolong exercise protocol ; apparent equivalent ( manipulative ) outcome ( pain relief , mobility function ) ; fall appal sequela morbidity , mortality expense , justifies research multimodal manipulative therapy treatment OAH . Data suggest therapy may give early , effective , less costly outcome reflect common clinical chiropractic approach OAH . In addition hip joint , OAH disability significantly worsen restrict knee flexion ; similar vein , KOA make bad hip joint stiffness dysfunction . Manipulative therapy fuller , full , kinetic chain ( lumbosacral foot ) appear superior Knee hip OA . The 2nd , new protocol ( protocol 2 ) compare 1st ( Hoeksma et al like protocol 1 ) . Additional PRN treatment protocols add maintain restore peak level improvement ( see ) . Specific Aim 1 : Recruit pool HOA patient senior center , local community , medical chiropractic clinic , advertise collaboration Universities/Colleges Schools . Specific Aim 2 : Establish protocol long-term surveillance OAH chiropractic patient . This study take 2 year . Recruitment first 9 month . Core measurement data collect : baseline ; blind measurement 9th treatment , 3 , 6 , 9 month follow . After end 9th treatment ( per protocol 2 ) , additional PRN treatment 1-3 visit every 1-3 month 6 month ( exceed 6 additional visit 9 month begin care ) . Specific Aim 3 : integrate clinical research program teaching clinic system . Specific Aim 4 : Analysis : collect compare outcome data compare protocol . Primary outcome measure : The McMaster Overall Therapy Effectiveness ( OTE ) Tool determine general improvement , satisfaction importance change , experience , patient . Secondary outcome measure : WOMAC , Harris Hip Scale , Goniometry , One Legged Standing test Berg Balance Scale . Specific Aim 5 : Cost Includes track : time , procedure cost visit CPT code . CPT data analyze various mean completion trial . ) Minimum outcome measure : Appropriate CPT code mark visit .</detailed_description>
