	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open label , randomize phase 2 study investigated effect second-line systemic treatment IMA901 plus GM-CSF RCC patient . Randomization do accord pre-treatment low-dose cyclophosphamide ( CY ) . Secondary endpoint comprise tumor response parameter . The study population consist HLA-A*02-positive men woman advance RCC clear-cell type classify favorable intermediate risk first-line systemic therapy . Patients age 18 year old , least one measurable tumor lesion receive first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor cytokine systemic therapy advance disease , patient experience disease progression . Patients arm receive total 17 vaccination GM-CSF follow IMA901 9 month treatment period . At screen baseline tumor status assess CT MRI . During study tumor assessment perform every 6 week . Immunomonitoring ( T-cell response peptide contain IMA901 analysis immune cell population may influence T-cell response ) , serum level antibody molecule suspect influence immune response assess several occasion study . Safety assessment comprise continuous adverse event reporting , regular physical examination regular assessment vital sign , hematology , blood chemistry urine . A 12-lead ECG perform screen end study . Pregnancy test perform accord applicable legislation country trial perform . At least , woman childbearing potential undergo pregnancy test screening study , first dose applied end study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Aged least 18 year HLA type : HLAA*02positive Histologically document advanced clearcell RCC Patients receive firstline tyrosine kinase inhibitor cytokine systemic therapy advance disease systematic therapy advance disease must candidate secondline therapy ( NOTE : Germany Austria patient firstline tyrosine kinase inhibitor failure include study ) Patients experience documented tumor progression At least one unidimensional measurable target lesion Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 80 % Favorable intermediate risk accord 3score MSKCC criterion . Able understand nature study give write informed consent Willingness ability comply study protocol duration study Poor risk accord 3score MSKCC criterion Immunosuppressive therapy within 4 week study entry , e.g . corticosteroid treatment History malignant tumor , except nonmelanomaskin cancer curatively excise cervical carcinoma situ Presence brain metastasis MRI CT scan Patients history evidence systemic autoimmune disease Any vaccination two week study entry Any plan prophylactic vaccination study entry end induction period ( 5 week first vaccination ) Known active hepatitis B C infection Known HIV infection Any infection biological agent cause severe disease pose severe danger lab personnel work patient tissue . Any following 4 week study entry : 1 . Major surgery 2 . Anticancer treatment include ( limited ) cytotoxic chemotherapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy , hormone therapy , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , monoclonal antibody 3 . Unresolved toxicity prior anticancer treatment include ( limited ) cytotoxic chemotherapy , hormone therapy , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , monoclonal antibody , radiotherapy , immunotherapy 4 . Received study drug within clinical study Any follow abnormal laboratory value : 1 . Hematology : Hb &lt; 9 g/dL ; WBC &lt; 3 x 109/L ; neutrophil &lt; 1.5 x 109/L ; lymphocyte &lt; 1.0 x 109/L ; platelet &lt; 100 x 109/L 2 .

Renal function : serum creatinine &gt; 200 µmol/L Patients significant disease currently uncontrolled treatment might interfere study completion , example : 1 . Heart failure non compensate active heart disease 2 . Severe coronary heart disease , cardiac arrhythmia require medication , uncontrolled hypertension 3 . Symptomatic neurotoxicity ( motor sensory ) ≥ grade 2 National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria ( NCICTC ) . 4 . Severe pulmonary dysfunction Psychiatric disability , seizures central nervous system disorder may interfere ability give inform consent perform adequate followup investigator 's opinion Active infection require oral intravenous antibiotic Women men decline practice medically approve method contraception Pregnancy breastfeed Any condition judgment investigator would place patient undue risk interfere result study</criteria>
