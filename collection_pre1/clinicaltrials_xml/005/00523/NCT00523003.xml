	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis : High protein diet show make people full help retent muscle mass . This study design determine effect protein- enriched meal replacement ( MR ) weight loss muscle mass retention comparison equal calorie carbohydrate-enriched MR. Methods : Single blind , placebo-controlled , randomized outpatient weight loss trial 100 obese men woman compare two equal calorie meal plans.,1 ) 2.2 g protein/kg LBM per day [ high protein diet ( HP ) ] 2 ) 1.1 g protein/kg LBM/day standard protein diet ( SP ) . Body weight , body composition , lipid profile measure baseline 12 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : While high protein diet show improve satiety retention lean body mass ( LBM ) , study design determine effect protein- enriched meal replacement ( MR ) weight loss LBM retention comparison isocaloric carbohydrate-enriched MR within customize diet plan utilize MR achieve high protein standard protein intake . Methods : Single blind , placebo-controlled , randomized outpatient weight loss trial 100 obese men woman compare two isocaloric meal plan utilizing standard MR add supplementary protein carbohydrate powder . MR use twice daily ( one meal , one snack ) . One additional meal include meal plan design achieve individualize protein intakes either 1 ) 2.2 g protein/kg LBM per day [ high protein diet ( HP ) ] 2 ) 1.1 g protein/kg LBM/day standard protein diet ( SP ) . LBM determine use bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) . Body weight , body composition , lipid profile measure baseline 12 week .</detailed_description>
