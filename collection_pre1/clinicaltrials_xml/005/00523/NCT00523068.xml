	<brief_summary>In patient symptom mixed incontinence ( loss urine associate coughing/sneezing/laughing , loss urine associate strong urge void ) , surgical treatment tension free vaginal tape pharmacological treatment tolterodine effective ? What parameters predictive success failure either form treatment ? What parameters predictive necessity treatment primary treatment ? Patients randomise surgical pharmacological treatment mixed incontinence symptom . They assess subjectively objectively pre-treatment treatment interval 3 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacological v Surgical Treatment Mixed Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study compare efficacy effect patient subsequent pharmacological treatment single dose tolterodine compare surgical treatment TVT patient urodynamically demonstrate mixed urinary incontinence , prevail symptom stress incontinence . Secondary aim identification parameter predictive success failure two treatment ( echography , duration symptom ) necessity treatment primary therapy . The primary objective reduce number incontinence episodes treatment either modality . The design randomisation 40 patient , 20 surgical group 20 pharmacological treatment group . The patient must female age 35 70 . They intend fall pregnant capable complete questionnaire incontinence symptom quality life , diary incontinence episode account pass urine , well able give inform consent participate study . The study last approximately 12 month consist 5 visit . At first visit , patient see verify suitability admission study , baseline blood test , urine analysis , well urodynamic assessment . They also give diary fill account urine passing ask complete course 3 day prior next appointment . At second appointment , patient 's diary collect review , quality life questionnaire complete , well ultrasound scan perform assess thickness wall bladder . The patient randomise pharmacological surgical group . Those surgical group put onto wait list TVT ( within 2 week second appointment ) , commence treatment tolterodine . 4 week either treatment patient see symptom assess second diary urinary behaviour ( complete patient week prior visit ) review . On final visit , 12 week treatment , patient undergo urodynamic testing , diary assessment , symptom assessment , quality life questionnaire complete appraisal patient 's satisfaction treatment collect . The discussion need treatment take place stage patient may treatment change either tolterodine surgery depend symptom . These patient finally see six month review progress .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must female urogynaecology study . 2 . An age 35 70 year . This take account incontinence tend prevail woman advance year . Younger woman may plan start family precludes participate . 3 . Clinical urodynamic evidence mixed incontinence prevalence symptom stress incontinence assess mean specific questionnaire visual analog scale ( VAS ) . The study assess treatment mixed incontinence patient evidence provide symptom . 4 . Candidates corrective surgery component sphincter defect Ba &lt; 1 accord International Continence Society ( ICS ) classification genital prolapse . 5 . Patients capable filling micturition diary , VAS , pathology specific quality life questionnaire , Kings Health Questionnaire . These form part continue assessment effectiveness treatment . 6 . Patients capable understanding signing inform write consent form participate trial . If patient unable give consent procedure investigation ethically recruit . 7 . Patients accept give birth vaginally future , jeopardize result surgical operation . 1 . Contraindications use anticholinergic agent ( urinary retention , uncontrolled narrowangle glaucoma , myasthenia gravis , severe ulcerative colitis , toxic megacolon ) . Anticholinergics form one group patient inability take drug therefore precludes participate . 2 . Ascertained hypersensitivity tolterodine excipients . For reason . 3 . Presence pathology condition Investigator 's opinion make patient unsuitable inclusion . 4 . Patients urinary tract infection ( UTI ) runin period . 5 . Patients recurrent urinary tract infection ( &gt; 5 past 12 month ) . 6 . Patients diagnose interstitial cystitis . These compromise result obtain . 7 . Patients haematuria uncertain origin . These patient need urgent investigation sign procedure include study . 8 . Patients treatment anticholinergic agent drug act detrusor instability . This compromise result study example patient randomise surgical group . 9 . Patients treatment oestrogen , unless therapy commence least 2 month prior inclusion study follow constant dosage . 10 . Patients diuretic . This affect urinary behaviour . 11 . Patients concomitant treatment potent CYP 34A inhibitor , macrolide antibiotic antimycotic agent . 12 . Patients undergo previous surgery distal urinary tract ( exception hysterectomy ) . 13 . Patients adequate contraceptive cover patient breastfeed . For reason avoid pregnancy study .</criteria>
