Patient 's fatigue status , measure Brief Fatigue Inventory-Taiwanese Form ( BFI-T ) , primary endpoint . The fatigue improvement response rate among patient two study arm compare basis efficacy evaluation end first treatment cycle , primary endpoint . Other endpoint , fatigue improvement response rate mean fatigue score change baseline among patient within cycle include secondary efficacy endpoint , compare two study arm . Patients ' quality sleep , appetite , pain , fatigue , nausea , vomit global quality life ( QoL ) also measure 11 question ( SS11 ) EORTC QLQ-C30 secondary endpoint evaluation .
