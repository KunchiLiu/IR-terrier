	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) debilitate chronic immune mediate inflammatory disease affect 1 % European population . RA associate significant joint damage , disability enhance mortality . Current treatment strategy target patient synovitis present several month clear patient develop persistent disease . After first 3 month symptom , others show persistence chronic inflammation rheumatoid synovium drive hyperplastic stromal tissue inhibits leukocyte apoptosis lead accumulation inflammatory cell joint . Therapies stage disease , conventional disease modify anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) well drug target TNF-alpha reduce disease activity unable cure RA . We identify early phase synovitis patient destine develop RA ( within first 12 week symptom ) represent pathologically distinct phase disease . This suggest late disease early disease give , first time , clear rationale early intervention . Building recent observation , propose test hypothesis disease process early stage RA fundamentally different establish chronic disease . This do assess whether treatment phase well-established gold standard modality anti-TNF-alpha therapy methotrexate permanently switch inflammation , prevent development RA thereby effect cure disease .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 18 year Synovial swell least 1 joint confirm clinical assessment Duration symptom attributable inflammatory joint disease ( pain , swell early morning stiffness &gt; 1 hour ) &lt; 12 week . Seropositivity RF antiCCP Ab Women childbearing potential men capable father child must use adequate birth control measure ( eg , abstinence , oral contraceptive , intrauterine device , barrier method spermicide , surgical sterilization ) study . Female subject childbearing potential must test negative pregnancy Previous history inflammatory arthritis . Previous use DMARDs antiTNFagents . Any current inflammatory condition sign symptom might confound diagnosis ( e.g . connective tissue disorder ) . Clinical evidence latent active granulomatous infection , include TB , histoplasmosis , coccidioidomycosis , prior study entry . Administration , expect administration , live virus bacterial vaccination within 3 month first administration study agent , trial . A history infect joint prosthesis , administration antibiotic suspect infection joint prosthesis , prosthesis remove replaced . Known infection HIV , hepatitis B , hepatitis C. A serious infection opinion investigator precludes receipt TNF block agent . Serious uncontrolled coexist disease opinion investigator preclude use TNFblocking medication , methotrexate depomedrone ( include pulmonary disease chest radiograph , congestive cardiac failure ( NYHA grade 3 4 ) , history demyelinate disease multiple sclerosis optic neuritis ) . Bleeding disorder use anticoagulants Any known malignancy history malignancy within previous 5 year ( exception basal cell carcinoma treat evidence recurrence ) . Any contraindication etanercept , methotrexate parenteral depomedrone . Patients also exclude follow laboratory result : haemoglobin &lt; 8.5 gm/dl , total white cell count &lt; 3.5 x 109/litre , serum transaminase value twice upper limit normal , serum creatinine &gt; 150 micromoles/litre .</criteria>
