	<brief_summary>This study , conduct NIH Clinical Research Unit Phoenix Indian Medical Center , examine body metabolism ( energy expenditure ) change people overeat fast different diet ( e.g. , high-protein high-fat ) affect metabolism . The result may provide information whether mechanism make people resistant others gain weight eat . Non-smoking healthy subject 18 55 year age weigh 350 pound may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Pregnancy test woman childbearing age . - Oral glucose tolerance test . For test , I.V . line ( needle attach plastic tube ) insert vein allow several blood draw without repeat needle stick . After first blood sample drawn , subject drink cola-flavored sugar solution . Five additional blood sample draw 3 hour . - Blood test DNA ( genetic ) study relate obesity , diabetes related medical problem . - DEXA scan . This test measure body fat . The subject lie table small dose X-rays pass body . - Respiratory chamber . This test measure many calorie body burn day assess energy balance intake expenditure . Subjects stay room two window , equip sink , toilet , television DVD player , desk , chair , telephone bed 24 hour . The test repeat five time first 18-day admission 3 time second 13-day admission . For first two session , subject feed diet equal amount energy body use . For next 6 stay feed double amount calorie body usually use 5 stay fast ( consume nothing water soda without caffeine calorie ) 1 stay . The overfeed diet may high low protein , normal protein , high fat . Blood test do day respiratory chamber session 24-hour urine sample collect one day chamber . - Eating behavior questionnaire . - Psychological performance test . Some participant ask volunteer repeat two chamber study validate measurement . The repeat session include fast overfeed normal protein content . All participant follow 6 month blood test , DEXA scan , urine test ( include pregnancy test woman ) . At annual visit year 1 7 , participant 6-month test plus oral glucose tolerance test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Some people appear resistant others gain weight overeat , though increase physical activity . This may indicate adaptive mechanism exist , lead waste heat part excess calorie take . Such mechanism exist rodent include activation brown fat , tissue also convert calorie heat warmth . Human study provide conflict result . A pilot study relationship weight change time change amount energy individual use 24 hour ( energy expenditure , EE ) 48-h overfeed ( OF ) fasting ( F ) Pima Indian men show person great increase EE OF small decrease EE F gain least weight time , indicate ability waste calorie overfed may reduce weight gain . Other study , however , show relationship . In addition , propose unbalanced diet help magnify effect . The aim study test whether ( ) change EE response 24-h OF F predict change weight two year , ( b ) high-carbohydrate diet diet high low protein amount may magnify metabolic response 24-h OF compare normal protein high-fat diet . 64 volunteer evaluate baseline , 6 month yearly basis 7 year . At baseline , subject undergo 8 24-h session human respiratory chamber measure EE weight-maintaining diet , random order : fasting , 200 % OF normal-protein diet , 200 % OF high fat , low-protein diet , 200 % OF high-fat , normal-protein diet , 200 % OF high fat , high protein diet , 200 % OF high-carbohydrate , normal-protein diet . Twenty volunteer two additional chamber try understand influence person respond overeat . Fifteen volunteer two additional chamber try understand source carbohydrate , i.e . simple sugar versus complex carbohydrate , high carbohydrate diet affect metabolism . Thirty volunteer also undergo 2 positron emission tomography ( PET ) study look relationship brown fat EE adult human . Body weight composition measure subsequent admission . Hormonal measurement find determinant adaptive change EE response OF F also perform . This study provide significant insight possible mechanism may help people resist weight gain obesity .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age : 1855 year , exclude effect age energy expenditure weight change . For PETCT substudy , woman limit age 1840 year high likelihood woman great 40 year , personal physician may recommend annual routine mammogram , thereby increase annual radiation exposure . Men also limit age range prevent age discrepancy men woman substudy . Premenopausal Weight : great equal 350 lb ( maximum weight allow DXA scan table manufacturer ) . Only men percent body fat le 25 % woman percent body fat le 33 % eligible thermic effect food ( TEF ) substudy substudy design assess effect body core insulation lean individual . Exclusion Criteria History clinical manifestation : Current smoking Impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) , type 1 type 2 diabetes Endocrine disorder , Cushing disease , pituitary disorder , hypo hyperthyroidism Pulmonary disorder , include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , would limit ability follow protocol ( investigator judgment ) Cardiovascular disease , include coronary heart disease , heart failure , arrhythmia , peripheral artery disease Hypertension , diagnose treat outside physician sit blood pressure measurement , use appropriate cuff , high 140/90 mmHg two occasion Liver disease , include cirrhosis , active hepatitis B C , AST ALT great equal 3 time normal Renal disease , define serum creatinine concentration great equal 1.5 mg/dl and/or proteinuria great 300 mg/day ( 200 ( Micro ) g/min ) Central nervous system disease , include previous history cerebrovascular accident , dementia , neurodegenerative disorder Cancer require treatment past five year , except nonmelanoma skin cancer cancer clearly cured opinion investigator carry excellent prognosis ( e.g. , Stage 1 cervical cancer ) . Infectious disease active tuberculosis , HIV ( selfreport ) , chronic coccidiomycoses chronic infection might influence weight . Conditions specifically mention may serve criterion exclusion discretion investigator Alcohol and/or drug abuse ( 3 drink per day use drug , amphetamine , cocaine , heroin , marijuana ) . Pregnancy lactation For PETCT substudy , radiation exposure torso research medical purpose within past 12 month For TEF substudy , allergy propranolol , BP le 100/60 , contraindication propranolol ingestion include asthma bradycardia . Prior begin study procedure , subject fully inform aim , nature , risk study prior give write informed consent . The study inform consent obtain principal associate investigator , research physician physician assistant work clinical research unit .</criteria>
