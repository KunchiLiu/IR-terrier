	<brief_summary>The purpose study understand severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) spread within family , significant disease result , body respond SARS . The study also explore affect SARS genetics immune system ( body system fights disease ) . Up 1000 people reside Beijing , China may involve study . Adult survivor SARS ( number 200 ) family member include child age 4 ask participate study . The study recruit additional 200 person , match SARs survivor similar age , gender , health status , housing/work location , recruit comparators . Blood take volunteer test presence SARS antibodies ( protein make body 's immune system response something cause infection ) . Health clinic/hospital visit record may review .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study investigate immune response , transmission nucleotide polymorphisms family severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) virus infection . Study objectives : develop immune response profile SARS coronavirus ( SARS CoV ) among SARS survivor ; ascertain whether spread SARS CoV within family whether significant disease result ; determine whether 1 nucleotide polymorphism relate occurrence severity SARS CoV disease immunologic response . Up 1,000 person reside Beijing , China , participate study include follow group : 200 adult ( great equal to18 year age ) subject , previously experience SARS cause SARS Coronavirus ; household/family member , include child age 4 ( male female ) ; additional 200 adult match characteristic ( age , gender , health status housing/work location ) 200 SARS survivor . As much possible ( DNA test ) , controls person involve health care possible SARS exposure epidemic . Blood obtain subject use SARS CoV antibody assay . Additional study perform blood specimen select subject . Tests serum antibody use identify infected person family . For posse specific antibody , review health clinic/hospital visit record SARS epidemic period conduct identify illness , type severity . A control interpretation illness study period uninfected family member . Data analyze age , gender , health status family member , severity SARS illness index case time return home environment . The illness data obtain medical record subject memory . To assess health status , subject study chest x-ray perform 15 mL blood obtain complete blood count , liver function , include ALT , creatinine . For study purpose , 30 100 mL blood collect SARS survivor 50 match control ( age , gender health status ) . Illnesses medical record characterize severity include extent x-ray change , need oxygen therapy , medical care intensive care unit extent leukocyte change . Microarray chip contain human gene determine immune response , production cytokine chemokines number potential response illness construct . PureGene kit provide isolation DNA blood specimen test polymorphism . These analysis perform 200 SARS survivor , 200 match control family member . The DNA sample ship laboratory Baylor College Medicine analysis use microarray chip .</detailed_description>
