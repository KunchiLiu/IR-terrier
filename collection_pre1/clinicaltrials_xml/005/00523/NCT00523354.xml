	<brief_summary>Eosinophilic Esophagitis ( EE ) chronic inflammatory disorder esophagus constantly increase prevalence . It demonstrate expression cytokine TNF-α regulate EE pro-inflammatory cytokine highly express keratinocytes esophageal epithelium patient active EE . Furthermore , show TNF-α capable induce eotaxin-3 production keratinocytes . These result suggest TNF-α play crucial role pathogenesis EE . Based finding , investigator plan prospective T1 translational study purpose evaluate efficacy Infliximab monotherapy adult patient severe , corticosteroid-dependent EE .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Off Label Use Infliximab Adult Patients With Severe Eosinophilic Esophagitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Principle : An open-conducted , un-controlled , label use Infliximab perform least 3 individual Eosinophilic Esophagitis ( EE ) evaluate efficacy TNF-α blockade treatment adult patient severe , isolated EE . Rationale Trial : Eosinophilic Esophagitis chronic , TH2-type dominant inflammatory disorder esophagus constantly increase prevalence . It demonstrate cytokine TNF-α IL-5 well chemokine eotaxin-3 play crucial role immuno-pathogenesis disease . These mediator potential target therapeutic intervention . The establish diagnostic criterion EE PPI-resistent esophageal relate symptom combination infiltration esophageal mucosa 20 eosinophils/hpf , tissue eosinophil normally encounter . Treatment strategies chronic inflammation basically two goal : 1 ) Relief symptom ; 2 ) Prevention long-term damage affect organ , due persistence uncontrolled inflammation . Standard recommendations medical therapy EE include systemic topical corticosteroid leukotriene antagonist . The treatment corticosteroid limit occurence steroid-dependence steroid-resistance , well corticosteroid adherent side effect . Infliximab , chimeric monoclonal IgG antibody , potent inhibitor soluble membrane-bound form TNF-α . Its efficacy induce maintain remission several TH1- TH2-type inflammation well document . Infliximab since 5 year approve therapy immune-mediated inflammation . Today , use standard therapy subset severe form disorder . Meanwhile overwhelm mass data confirm efficacy safety compound . Purpose Study : The purpose pilot-trial evaluate efficacy TNF-α blockade Infliximab monotherapy induction-treatment adult patient severe EE .</detailed_description>
