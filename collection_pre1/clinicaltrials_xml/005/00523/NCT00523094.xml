	<brief_summary>The primary objective study estimate accuracy pre-operative VRI quantitative result versus gold standard pre-operative perfusion scan . The secondary objective ass correlation predict post-operative lung function observe post-operative lung function ( forced expiratory volume 1 second [ FEV1 ] diffuse capacity lung carbon monoxide [ DLCO ] ) patient underwent surgical resection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vibration Response Imaging ( VRI ) Patients That Are Candidates Undergoing Pulmonary Operation Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre lung operation candidate procedure lung volume reduction surgery ( LVRS ) , lung resection , bullectomy lung transplant frequently evaluate differential lung function semi quantitative lung scintigraphy . VRI may offer differential lung function information physician without risk , time patient discomfort lung scintigraphy treat physician office . Moreover , VRI may provide safe , quick simple method measure `` split function '' lung cancer patient candidate lung surgery . Thus eliminate safety complexity issue relate current ventilation perfusion `` split function '' method . In addition VRI may aid achieve goal develop strategy reduce risk maximize number patient benefit surgical therapy .</detailed_description>
