	<brief_summary>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) characterize progressive subcortical cortical neuronal degeneration . AD patient differ time course neuronal degeneration accompany cognitive decline . With recent advance MR imaging , include optimize data acquisition processing technique , tool especially well suited track long-term pathological change well drug treatment effect become available . In addition structural imaging , new acquisition analysis technique develop determine integrity subcortical fiber tract vivo . In present project propose determine predictor disease progression treatment response investigate potential treatment effect structural disease progression , cover continuum axonal degeneration cortical neuronal loss taking advantage recent advance MRI acquisition analysis technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The outlined project provide data determine value cortical subcortical volumetric diffusion marker neuronal degeneration predict disease progression response ( acetyl- ) cholinergic treatment Galantamine ( Reminyl® ) . Furthermore , analysis longitudinal MRI data respect cortical subcortical atrophy fiber degeneration provide estimate potential new MRI analysis technique determine effect ( acetyl- ) cholinergic treatment rate disease progression . Finally , propose study allow determine potential value new MRI technique , diffusion tensor imaging , show morphological correlate cortical disconnection AD map progression treatment related effect subcortical fiber tract integrity AD . The major scientific value project combine description effect Galantamine ( Reminyl® ) disease progression structural level analysis AD . The data project may help identify predictor treatment response elucidate mechanism drug action Galantamine ( Reminyl® ) AD .</detailed_description>
