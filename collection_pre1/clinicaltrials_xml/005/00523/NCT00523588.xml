	<brief_title>Treatment Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus ( CLE ) With 595 nm Flashlamp Pulsed Dye Laser</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Candela Vbeam PerfectaTM FDA approve 595nm Flashlamp Pulsed Dye Laser ( PDL ) use treatment benign skin lesion . The purpose use PDL study help improve study patient ' skin disease . Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus often start damage skin lesion frequently difficult treat available therapeutic measure . This study use flashlamp PDL compare treat cutaneous lesion non-treated lesion . We look factor degree erythema ( redness skin ) , scale hypertrophy ( increase size skin ) , scar dyspigmentation ( abnormality formation distribution skin coloration ) make summary score factor . It important note device currently use treat patient skin lesion Department Dermatology University Pennsylvania , study do . Although PDL use treat patient , use study experimental . The PDL consider laser choice vascular lesion , wavelength 585-595 nm , laser know produce excellent clinical result minimal risk patient . The laser use successfully treatment port-wine stain child young 1 month age . The PDL design deliver intense gentle burst laser light skin . The light absorbed blood vessel vascular lesion , leave surround tissue undamaged . The PDL use clinically treatment cutaneous lesion childhood port-wine stain , childhood proliferative angioma , facial telangiectasias , poikiloderma Civatte , nevus flammeus , capillary hemangioma , scar , verruca , lupus erythematosus . Several study know used 585-595nm PDL treat cutaneous lupus erythematosus lesion . During period 5 month , study patient receive 3-5 treatment one skin lesion pulse dye laser . Clinical follow-up examination include photograph , clinical assessment blind physician , pain itch scale study patient . The study require total one year commitment per study patient .</detailed_description>
