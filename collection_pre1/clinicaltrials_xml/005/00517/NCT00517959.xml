	<brief_title>SCRT Versus Conventional RT Children Young Adults With Low Grade Benign Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Brain tumours common solid tumour child appropriate treatment , nearly half achieve long term cure . Radiotherapy essential management majority tumour . Conventional radiotherapy alone combination surgery and/or chemotherapy tumours optic glioma , hypothalamic glioma , craniopharyngiomas , germ cell tumour , low grade tumour achieve excellent long term control rate range 70 95 % . However , tumour control effective , concern treatment relate morbidity . include cognitive dysfunction 38 % , motor deficit 25 % , visual impairment 20 % , hormonal dysfunction 20 % psychological-emotional problem 14 % survivor . It difficult ascertain report exact contribution factor interact . Radiotherapy believe least partly responsible although exact role yet quantify . Most evidence regard post-radiotherapy neuropsychological cognitive dysfunction retrospective study involve whole brain radiotherapy . Neuroendocrine dysfunction well-documented late sequela follow treatment patient brain tumour . This could either due direct involvement pituitary hypothalamic axis ( PHA ) tumour result surgical radiation injury region . For tumour directly involve PHA , commonest cause neuroendocrine dysfunction cranial irradiation . PHA region unavoidably receive radiation whole brain radiotherapy tumour arise region . For treatment tumour adjacent PHA involve , may frequently part radiotherapy plan target volume , include gross tumour margin account microscopic disease possible daily set inaccuracy thus receive significant dos . The region may also sometimes come entry / exit path radiation beam treatment tumour even away region . Radiation induce hormonal abnormality generally dose dependent may develop many year irradiation . To reduce impact endocrine dysfunction physical , mental sexual development , important detect treat timely . Early growth hormone replacement way minimise growth retardation cause deficiency treatment expensive significant financial implication , especially country . The annual cost GH replacement approximately Rs 200,000.00 , prohibitive vast majority Indian parent cost LHRH analogue , useful prevent early epiphyseal fusion stunt growth child post radiation tumour relate precocious puberty . 1.4 Evolution Stereotactic conformal radiotherapy ( SCRT ) Conventional radiotherapy technique generally involve use 2-3 radiation beam cover tumour margin 1-3 cm subclinical disease physical inaccuracy daily treatment delivery . The last decade see tremendous technological advance radiotherapy plan accurate treatment delivery . Stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) stereotactic radiotherapy ( SRT ) technique involve firm accurate immobilisation fix relocatable frame , high precision three-dimensional ( 3-D ) target localisation CT/CT-MRI fusion focus radiation delivery . This achieve either multiple source cobalt unit ( gamma knife ) multiple arc use modified conventional linear accelerator . Such conventional stereotactic irradiation technique typically produce spherical high dose volume therefore suitable small spherical lesion . A majority brain tumour consider radiotherapy however spherical frequently extend adjacent structure . To treat large non-spherical volume conventional SRS require addition multiple small spherical high dose volume describe multiple isocentre treatment . The overlap high dose sphere result dose inhomogeneity , associate high incidence radiation induce complication . It previously demonstrate optimum way deliver high precision localise irradiation large non-spherical target use multiple conformal fix field individualise shield radiation field conform shape target . This principle conformal therapy combine precision stereotactic localisation focus radiation delivery describe stereotactic conformal radiotherapy ( SCRT ) . Traditionally , stereotactic irradiation deliver one session single fraction radiosurgery . High dos radiation give one fraction know associate high risk radiation induce damage normal tissue particularly true central nervous system . Giving radiation small individual dos allow delivery high radiation dos without serious injury normal tissue , especially important normal CNS structure . Single fraction SRS show associate considerable neurological toxicity optic apparatus cranial nerve normal brain . With application high precision relocatable non-invasive mean immobilisation , become possible deliver stereotactic irradiation fractionate manner . The technique SCRT combine precision focus radiation delivery radiobiological advantage fractionation . It also ensure homogenous dose distribution within irradiated volume reduce risk damage . The basic aim high precision SCRT achieve high dose differential tumour surround normal tissue . This allow either increase tumour dose improve local control potential decrease radiation damage normal tissue . Further optimisation technique involve 3-4 conformal non-coplanar field arrangement show significant dose reduction normal brain . Preliminary experience , mainly adult show technique feasible routine practice busy radiotherapy department . Early result term local control conventional radiotherapy , increase spar surround normal brain adjacent critical structure . While experience limit young child , report suggest feasible population also . The technique potential minimise dose critical site close tumour like pituitary-hypothalamic complex , cochlea , brain stem , optic apparatus mesial temporal lobe , believe common site radiation injury lead late morbidity . NEED FOR THE PRESENT STUDY The finding significant long-term effect large proportion brain tumour survivor mandate development treatment strategy design minimise impact quality life . Although precise role radiotherapy causation various post treatment sequela establish , generally believe least partly responsible effect . There attempt modify management term avoid , delay radiotherapy reduce total radiation dose tumour view reduce impact long-term toxicity . However , reduction radiotherapy dose tumour show result poorer local control rate . Also , majority patient radiation delay eventually require radiotherapy later stage ( 37 ) . There also evidence radiotherapy give upfront yield superior disease control radiotherapy give time tumour progression ( 38,39 ) . In light data , therefore , ever-increasing need explore technique radiotherapy minimise irradiation normal brain critical structure without compromise radiotherapy dose essential tumour control . SCRT modern high-precision radiotherapy technique , reduce volume normal brain irradiated capability minimise dose critical structure . The evidence long term effect focal irradiation far retrospective study small prospective trial . There therefore , great need evaluate issue prospective manner large number patient . The present study design prospectively estimate incidence severity neuropsychological , cognitive neuroendocrine dysfunction follow radiotherapy deliver conventional stereotactic technique would one comprehensive study provide important longitudinal reliable data regard sequela . The study involve 200 patient would best knowledge large ever study conduct far also randomise trial assess sequelae patient receive focal brain irradiation . The study also examine whether physical advantage modern technological progress translate clinical benefit . This could significant implication radiotherapeutic management child young adult brain tumour . The study unique design term evaluate efficacy SCRT respect conventional radiotherapy term long term tumour control treatment related complication . If present trial succeed reduce incidence severity radiotherapy relate sequelae SCRT technique , would undoubtedly result tremendous benefit patient . A possible reduction neuroendocrine sequela improve quality life patient would also result major financial save . This critical patient live develop country cost endocrinological management term hormonal assay replacement largely prohibitive . We Januray 2009 accrue 128 patient far trial</detailed_description>
