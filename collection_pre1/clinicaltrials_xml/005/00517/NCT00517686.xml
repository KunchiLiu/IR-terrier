	<brief_title>Feedback Treatment Intensification Data Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Risk ( FIT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Project Description : We propose cluster randomize trial intervention involve eight medical facility Kaiser Permanente Northern California ( KP ) 65,000 patient high risk CVD . At intervention facility , patient-level information obtain KP 's electronic health record need treatment intensification ( systolic blood pressure , LDL-c , A1c ) recent medication adherence add population management database feed back software currently use staff work primary care provider . Staff control facility continue use population management database software receive information risk factor level select medication . Specific Aims : 1 . Evaluate effectiveness measurement feedback treatment intensification information patient high risk CVD improve rate treatment intensification reduce level poorly control systolic blood pressure , LDL-c , A1c . 2 . Evaluate impact intervention , compare current practice , total number patient contact , outpatient visit , cost care relation improvement risk factor control . 3 . Evaluate effect innovation physician staff perception value ( effectiveness efficiency ) population management program high-risk patient . Relevance : If translational study show feedback information treatment intensification lead high rate intensification improve risk factor control , find show population-level use health information technology improve clinical quality also validate treatment intensification metric clinical quality .</detailed_description>
