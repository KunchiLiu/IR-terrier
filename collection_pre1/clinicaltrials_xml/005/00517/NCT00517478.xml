	<brief_title>Thromboelastography As A Tool Possible Clopidogrel Resistance The Patients Treated With Primary PCI STEMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dual anti-aggregant therapy recommend standard therapy applicable patient group undergo PPCI . The aspirin-clopidogrel regiment sign every patient without assess therapeutic effect . In face grow evidence platelet resistance standardize therapy demand reliable diagnostic tool rapid accurate assessment platelet reactivity . TEG establish technique ass quality clot formation ' use mainly surgery obstetrics determine possible bleeding diathesis . Recently become used cardiology , valuable tool ass response antiplatelet therapy association outcome . However , data use TEG STEMI patient undergo PCI . Our study design ass TEG platelet 's response clopidogrel treatment acute STEMI patient undergo primary PCI correlation response long term outcome .</detailed_description>
