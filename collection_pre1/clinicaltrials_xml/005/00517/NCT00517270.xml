	<brief_summary>Non-cardiac chest pain account 2-5 % emergency presentation . In United States , estimate approximately US $ 8 billion spend annually initial care patient suspect acute coronary syndrome , subsequently find coronary artery disease ( 1 ) . The common cause non-cardiac chest pain gastro-oesophageal reflux disease ( 2 ) . Two randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial use omeprazole versus placebo treatment NCCP publish western population report efficacy 62 % 80 % ( 3,4 ) . High-dose omeprazole use previous trial ( 3,4 ) . Recently , show rabeprazole , newly develop benzimidazole proton pump inhibitor , potent rapid inhibitor H+ , K+-ATPase acid secretion omeprazole , lansoprazole pantoprazole ( 5,6 ) . Whether finding apply Chinese population unknown . Thus would like propose randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial study effect high-dose proton pump inhibitor treatment non-cardiac chest pain Chinese population . The aim study evaluate efficacy high-dose proton pump inhibitor treatment gastro-oesophageal reflux relate non-cardiac chest pain .</brief_summary>
