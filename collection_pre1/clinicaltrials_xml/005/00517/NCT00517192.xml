	<criteria>1 . Signed informed consent prior trial participation . 2 . HIV1 infect male female &gt; 18 year age . 3 . Threeclass ( NRTI , NNRTI , PI ) treatmentexperienced patient ( minimum 3months duration class document class hypersensitivity/intolerance ) resistance ( minimal reduce response ) one PI screen virtual phenotype resistance test . In case NNRTIs , NNRTI resistance absence exposure equivalent NNRTI treatment experience . 4 . Patient 's optimize background regimen must contain one follow ARV option : A minimum two genotypically active nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) report `` maximal response '' `` sensitive '' screen virtual phenotype report . A minimum one genotypically active NRTI report `` maximal response '' `` sensitive '' screen virtual phenotype report plus Enfuvirtide use previously . A minimum one genotypically active NRTI report `` maximal response '' `` sensitive '' screen virtual phenotype report plus integrase inhibitor use previously available expanded access program allow local regulatory authority . A minimum one genotypically active NRTI report `` maximal response '' `` sensitive '' screen virtual phenotype report plus CCR5 chemokine receptor antagonist Maraviroc available expanded access program , use previously allow local regulatory authority . Zero one genotypically active NRTI report `` maximal response '' `` sensitive '' screen virtual phenotype report plus two follow drug , Enfuvirtide , integrase inhibitor Maraviroc available , use previously allow local regulatory authority . Two genotypically partially active NRTIs ( provide part current fail regimen ) report `` reduce response '' screen virtual phenotype report plus one follow drug , Enfuvirtide , integrase inhibitor Maraviroc available , use previously allow local regulatory authority . 5 . Patient current ( fail ) PIcontaining regimen least 8 week prior randomization . 6 . Patient ongoing viral replication ( define HIV1 viral load ≥ 500 copies/mL ) successful virtual phenotype obtain screen . 7 . Any baseline CD4 cell count allow . 8 . Karnofsky performance score ≥ 70 . 9 . Acceptable screen laboratory value indicate adequate baseline organ function . Laboratory value consider acceptable follow apply : ALT ≤2.5 x ULN AST ≤2.5 x ULN ( ≤DAIDS Grade 1 , Appendix 10.1 ) . Any DAIDS grade cholesterol , triglyceride , GGT , CPK LDH acceptable . All laboratory test value must ≤DAIDS Grade 2 . 10 . Willingness initiate CD4+ cell countguided chemoprophylaxis prevent opportunistic infection . 11 . Willingness abstain ingest substance may alter plasma study drug level interaction cytochrome P450 system study . 1 . Previous use Tipranavir ( TPV ) Darunavir ( DRV ) . 2 . Full genotypic resistance ( report minimal response ) Tipranavir ( TPV ) Darunavir ( DRV ) screen virtual phenotype : 3 . Female patient childbearing potential : positive serum pregnancy test screening , breast feeding , plan become pregnant , willing use doublebarrier method ( simultaneous use two different method diaphragm spermicidal substance condom ) contraception require ethinyl estradiol administration . Barrier method contraception include diaphragm spermicidal substance , condom female , cervical cap condom . 4 . History Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) , Visceral Kaposi 's Sarcoma ( KS ) , and/or malignancy . 5 . Any AIDS defining illness unresolved , symptomatic stable treatment least 12 week screen visit . 6 . Use immunomodulatory drug ( interferon , cyclosporin , hydroxyurea interleukin 2 ) within 30 day prior randomization . 7 . Current use systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy . 8 .
