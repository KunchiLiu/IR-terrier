	<brief_summary>The primary goal study determine safety tolerability novel peptide - preimplantation factor ( PIF-1 ) - patient develop acute steroid-resistant graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) match bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) . Following matched BMT , patient place standard GVHD preventive therapy ( cyclosporine ) ; respond cyclosporine place high-dose steroid regimen 3 day . Patients respond standard treatment give PIF-1 subcutaneously 14 day . Clinical data sample collect , PIF-1 administration additional three month thereafter , examine long-term effect PIF-1 treatment patient ' GVHD status .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Allogeneic BMT well-established treatment modality malignant non-malignant hematological disease . Mature donor T cell within stem-cell graft main mediator beneficial immune effect , also responsible induction GVHD , become major cause morbidity mortality post-transplant . Acute GVHD occur within 100-day period post-transplant generally manifest dermatitis , enteritis , hepatitis . The treatment GVHD continue challenge . To eliminate undesirable host-derived hematopoietic element BMT , patient traditionally treat myeloablative conditioning regimen involve high-dose chemotherapy total-body irradiation . Standard GVHD prophylaxis therapy comprise drug cause generalize immune suppression place patient danger opportunistic infection tumor relapse . For acute GVHD prevention , cyclosporine often use ; however , frequently necessary administer long-term high-dose steroid well . An acute GVHD patient 's lack response steroid associate poor prognosis . The ideal prophylaxis treatment BMT patient would one prevent graft attack host , modulate host 's immune response would accept transplant , maintain ability protect body opportunistic hostile agent . Pregnancy immune paradox : allow maternal ( host ) acceptance semi-allograft ( embryo ) , cause graft-versus-host host-versus-graft reaction host/mother , immune suppression . Therefore , pregnant immunological status compatible desire immune profile patient undergoing BMT . By replicate immune profile present pregnancy BMT patient , may able reduce occurrence GVHD-related morbidity mortality rate . Preimplantation factor ( PIF-1 ) novel , embryo-secreted peptide whose synthetic version match native peptide 's property . PIF-1 appear play important role mediate maternal response pregnancy mammal . In preclinical study , PIF-1 find effective preclinical BMT-GVHD model , without apparent toxicity .</detailed_description>
