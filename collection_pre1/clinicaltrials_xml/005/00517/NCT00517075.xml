	<brief_summary>This study test whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) helpful treat negative symptom social deficit schizophrenia . This first rTMS study assess social function social cognition . 1 . Hypoactivity dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) implicate generate negative symptom schizophrenia . Abnormalities leave inferior parietal lobe ( IPL ) also associate negative symptom . We hypothesize high frequency rTMS apply hypoactive left DLPFC leave IPL individual schizophrenia reduce negative symptom severity sham ( placebo ) rTMS assess Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) negative symptom subscale . 2 . We hypothesize high frequency rTMS apply left DLPFC leave IPL schizophrenia patient improve social dysfunction sham ( placebo ) rTMS assess Social Adjustment Scale , Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale Social Functioning Scale .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Negative Symptoms Schizophrenia With Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most treatment schizophrenia helpful treat positive symptom ( e.g . hallucination ) , whereas negative symptom ( e.g . low social drive ) partially responsive medication . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) noninvasive way stimulate brain FDA approve treatment depression show promise schizophrenia . In rTMS therapy , device call `` magnetic stimulator '' provide electrical energy magnetic coil delivers magnetic field . When coil place surface head , magnetic field cause part brain either increase decrease activity , depend quickly magnetic pulse deliver . This study design test whether high-frequency rTMS deliver area near front head , call dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , improve `` negative symptom '' schizophrenia , include decreased thinking , difficulty motivating , social withdrawal . Participation first phase study consist session last 45 minute per day , 5 day week , 4 week . Twenty-four subject randomly assign receive four week either active ( real ) rTMS inactive ( sham ) rTMS . Patients receive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain help locate rTMS apply . Symptoms rat baseline , rTMS course , end 4 week . Patients meet response criterion four week randomize phase offer active ( real ) daily rTMS additional four week open phase study . All patient two monthly repeat assessment last rTMS session examine persistence benefit . We also collect measure motor cortex excitability ( perform single pulse TMS ) baseline , end randomize , applicable , open study phase , two follow-up assessment determine whether change measure correlate clinical improvement . In addition , look brain dynamic use electroencephalography ( EEG ) pre- post-rTMS first last session study phase . We also assess effect rTMS cigarette use , schizophrenia patient know increased prevalence nicotine dependence . There also preliminary evidence high frequency rTMS leave DLPFC decrease cigarette smoking .</detailed_description>

Able commute NYC daily treatment ( Monday Friday ) least 4 week . Individuals diagnose investigator follow condition ( current unless otherwise state ) : Current affective disorder include Major Depressive Disorder , Bipolar Affective Disorder ; substance abuse dependence within past year ( except nicotine caffeine ) . An Axis II Personality Disorder , judgment investigator may hinder patient complete procedure require study protocol . Other exclusion criterion include common every TMS protocol : Individuals clinically define neurological disorder insult include , limited : Any condition likely associate increase intracranial pressure ; Space occupy brain lesion ; Any history seizure EXCEPT therapeutically induce ECT ; History cerebrovascular accident ; Transient ischemic attack within two year ; Cerebral aneurysm ; Dementia ; Parkinson 's disease ; Huntington 's chorea ; Multiple sclerosis . Increased risk seizure reason , include prior diagnosis increase intracranial pressure ( large infarction trauma ) , history epilepsy seizure firstdegree relative , metal inside head , history significant head trauma loss consciousness 5 minute . Prior adverse reaction TMS . History treatment rTMS therapy disorder . Cardiac pacemaker , implanted medication pump , intracardiac line , acute , unstable cardiac disease . Intracranial implant ( e.g. , aneurysm clip , shunt , stimulators , cochlear implant , electrode ) metal object within near head , exclude mouth , safely remove . Current illicit drug use . Clinically significant laboratory abnormality , opinion investigator . ( Note : Clinically significant laboratory abnormality refers patient lab result fall outside establish normal range , may indicative presence medical condition , think reflect artifact routine lab error ( e.g . hemolysis ) . Results laboratory test review study physician prior treatment . Abnormal lab result clinical significance resolve ( e.g . repeat test rule laboratory error poor quality original sample ) lead exclusion study . ) Known suspect pregnancy . Women breastfeed . Women childbearing potential use medically accept form contraception engage sexual intercourse . Wearing medicinal skin patch MRI scan .</criteria>
