	<brief_title>Sildenafil Trial Exercise Performance Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IPF disease fibrous tissue clog lung . This eventually damage air sacs lung lead widespread permanent scar lung tissue . Individuals IPF may experience breathe difficulty , cough , chest pain , decrease exercise capacity . Pulmonary hypertension , high blood pressure arteries lung , affect half people IPF . The fibrous tissue clog lung also block blood flow lung effectively , reduce amount oxygen lung . The fibrous tissue also reduce lung ' ability use oxygen available . These factor cause breathe difficulty may eventually lead heart disease . Sildenafil medication increase blood supply lung reduce heart 's workload . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness sildenafil improve breathe function , exercise capacity , quality life people advance IPF . This study enroll people advance IPF . Participants randomly assign receive sildenafil placebo three time day 12 week . Study visit occur baseline Weeks 1 , 6 , 12 . At Week 12 , participant option continue study additional 12 week . All participant agree continue study receive sildenafil three time day second 12 week . Study visit occur Weeks 13 , 18 , 24 . At study visit , physical exam blood collection occur . At select visit , follow study procedure occur : lung function testing ; urine collection ; 6-minute walk test , measure distance walk 6-minute period ; questionnaires ass health status , breathing , quality life . Participants record medication usage symptom daily diary . Study researcher review medical record Social Security death index 5 year follow end study determine incidence death among study participant .</detailed_description>
