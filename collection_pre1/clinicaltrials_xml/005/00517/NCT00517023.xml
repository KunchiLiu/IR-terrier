	<brief_summary>Syncope ( commonly call collapse blackout ) define loss consciousness transient , self limit usually lead fall . While cause syncope encompass wide variety factor , due heart rhythm abnormality acknowledge significantly serious compare cause . The main aim study see possible find cause patient 's syncope faster use device call implantable loop recorder ( ILR ) , implanted skin , versus conventional management . The device slightly large 50 penny coin record rhythm heart continuously . Although ILRs use widely today , want use new model able relay information doctor via wireless technology internet . We also want use ILRs earlier diagnose syncope , thereby avoid unnecessary lengthy hospital admission lower cost . Primary aim : To see soon ILR detect abnormal heart rhythm normal one ( study subject faint/ suffer syncope ) . Secondary aim : 1 . To see soon treatment start abnormal rhythm detect ILR . 2 . To see group ( patient ILRs receive conventional test ) receive treatment sooner . 3 . To see group less subsequent collapse i.e benefit appropriate treatment sooner . 4 . To assess cost effectiveness use implantable loop recorder diagnostic tool syncope versus conventional management ( save many hospital admission ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Eastbourne Syncope Assessment Study II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The original EaSyAS study ( 1998 ) evaluate use implantable loop recorder ( ILRs ) diagnosis management syncope.This demonstrate significant increase successful diagnosis follow use implantable loop recorder . Here 442 syncope admission Eastbourne 2001 . Diagnostic rate 42 % . In addition , time diagnosis quicker therefore introduction therapy . This result significant increase time recurrent syncopal episode improve general wellbeing unselected population syncope unknown cause . The `` Post-EaSyAS '' study evaluate extend ( 2.5 year ) follow patient . The `` Tis-EaSyAS '' study evaluate 3 different tilt protocol long term ILR follow describe positive predictive value tilt test unexplained syncope . The EaSyAS II study elaborate use ILR avoid hospital admission optimise use falls/syncope clinic , potentially improve cost effective diagnosis management syncope . ILRs implant without patient admission follow syncope/falls assessment clinic , compare optimal protocol drive current management . The ILR use capability record transmit heart rhythm abnormality wireless receiver relay information clinician via internet . It hop shorten diagnosis time speed commencement treatment patient , avoid expensive test expensive hospital admission .</detailed_description>
