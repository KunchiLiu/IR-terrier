	<brief_summary>The purpose study test whether colloid-based goal-directed intraoperative fluid management lead less perioperative morbidity compare crystalloid-based goal-directed intraoperative fluid management . Goal-directed therapy base measurement Esophageal Doppler Device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Crystalloids Versus Colloids During Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For long time rag debate whether crystalloid solution colloid solution well suit fluid therapy . Early proponent crystalloids [ Shires 1961 ] colloid [ Shoemaker 1979 ] deserve credit elucidate important fact volume replacement therapy - without answer primary question . Elaborate review compare crystalloid colloid therapy critically ill patient perform late ninety update recently [ Roberts 2004 ] . However , suggest question answer review leave u none wiser [ Webb 1999 ] . Although plethora study compare crystalloid vs. colloid therapy last decade publish , volume replacement therapy still consider base dogma personal belief [ Boldt 2003 ] . Goal-directed intraoperative fluid therapy monitor Esophageal Doppler identify volume-responders , thereby decrease length stay hospital orthopedic [ Sinclair 1997 ] , cardiac [ Mythen 1995 ] , abdominal surgery patient [ Gan 2002 , Wakeling 2005 , Noblett 2006 ] . However , study perform colloid substance apply . Thus , question whether monitor Esophageal Doppler monitor , application additional colloid improve outcome [ Horowitz , Kumar 2003 ] . Consequently , researcher use Esophageal Doppler Monitoring intraoperative goal-directed fluid therapy compare effect crystalloid vs. colloid therapy various organ system , assess combine perioperative morbidity [ Bennett-Guerrero 1999 ] .</detailed_description>
