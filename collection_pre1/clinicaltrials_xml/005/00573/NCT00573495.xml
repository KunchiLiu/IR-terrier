	<brief_summary>This study activate immune system vaccine . The vaccine make two protein find breast cancer : telomerase survivin . The vaccine give combination drug may also effect immune system attack cancer . The goal study : 1. test safety combination agent 2. find effect treatment advance breast cancer</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients advance breast cancer may often fail standard care treatment metastatic disease . This research study combination agent impact immune system . About &gt; 85 % human cancer , include breast cancer , express telomerase ( hTERT ) activity . Targeting hTERT immunologically may also minimize immune escape due antigen loss mutation deletion hTERT may incompatible sustained tumor growth . hTERT Multi-Peptide Vaccine make 1540 hTERT peptide cryptic peptide select `` low-affinity '' bind HLA-A2 order increase likelihood host immune system would ignore , modify change first amino acid peptide tyrosine order increase HLA - A2 affinity . The two `` heteroclitic '' peptide R572Y ( YLFFYRKSV ) D988Y ( YLQVNSLQTV ) , bind HLA-A2 high avidity elicit specific CTL ( cytotoxic T lymphocyte ) responses use healthy donor mononuclear cell vitro . In addition , mouse model , peptide vaccine elicit lytic CTL response protective tumor challenge use TERT-expressing murine tumor . Subjects also immunize peptide vaccine derive survivin , important anti-apoptotic protein overexpressed broad range malignancy include breast cancer . Survivin may ideal `` universal '' tumor antigen since overexpressed wide variety cancer yet terminally differentiate adult cell express protein . CMV derive CTL epitope use positive control peptide . Daclizumab humanize anti-human CD25 monoclonal antibody bind specifically CD25 express cell , include Treg cell , inhibits proliferation . Prevnar design augment T-helper cell immunity .</detailed_description>
