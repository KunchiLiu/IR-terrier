	<brief_summary>Radiation dermatitis common side-effect radiation therapy cancer patient frequently experience redness , pain , crusting , even ulceration skin cause suffer treatment interruption . A recent retrospective study DeLand demonstrate administer light emit diode ( LED ) photomodulation radiation treatment breast cancer decrease radiation dermatitis majority patient . LED photomodulation process specific sequence light used regulate manipulate cell activity without cause heat damage skin . Each LED treatment painless complete usually less one minute . LED photomodulation may reduce suffer associate radiation treatment , improve cosmetic outcome radiation field , eliminate break radiation treatment may require severe ulcerating reaction . This study attempt replicate finding Dr. DeLand 's study randomly assign least 40 breast cancer patient either treatment group control group . The treatment group receive LED photomodulation treatment radiation treatment Gentlewaves Selectâ„¢ handheld high energy 590nm LED array use specific sequence pulse used study ; treatment group also receive 7 additional treatment 2 week radiation treatment course complete . The control group receive LED treatment use exact skin care regimen treatment group . In addition weekly evaluation grade skin reaction , subject photograph standardized condition weekly photograph evaluate grade blinded dermatologist .</brief_summary>
