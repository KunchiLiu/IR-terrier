	<brief_summary>Our first Aim describe common sudden decrease renal function happen premature infant neonatal intensive care unit . We also want see sudden loss renal function affect survival . Finally , explore non-invasive marker identify sudden decrease renal function urinary sample .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Kidney Injury Premature Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advancements field peri-natal medicine improve survival critically ill neonate yet many still survive , many leave long-term damage vital organ system . Very little data available impact acute kidney injury ( AKI ) survival premature infant , adult pediatric study show even mild AKI independently impact survival correct severity illness . The role AKI impact survival premature infant likely great adult acute injury occur context impaired ongoing kidney development.. Our ability improve outcome child adult AKI hamper inability recognize AKI early disease process . Thus , work early non-invasive biomarkers renal injury bring great optimism field AKI . Serum urinary level neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) , urinary interleukin 18 ( IL-18 ) others markedly elevate several hour AKI oppose serum creatinine take day rise inciting event . Early non-invasive biomarkers AKI test premature infant . Inclusion criterion - infant ( birthweight 500-1500g ) ask participate study . â€¢ Exclusion criterion - Infants prenatal renal ultrasound diagnosis severe hydronephrosis know renal abnormality exclude</detailed_description>
