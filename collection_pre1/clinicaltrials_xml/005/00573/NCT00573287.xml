	<brief_summary>Many individual schizophrenia abuse cannabis onset illness , portend poor course illness poorer treatment response . Preliminary evidence suggest clozapine may uniquely reduce substance use patient schizophrenia . The purpose study establish effective methodology study early treatment clozapine patient co-occurring schizophrenia cannabis use disorder , generate pilot data compare clozapine vs. risperidone substance use , psychiatric symptom , side effect , treatment discontinuation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia relapse disorder produce profound effect afflict becomes chronic , often lead severe long-term disability . However , initial year illness many patient treatment responsive may achieve substantial period remission . Comorbid substance use disorder , common concomitant schizophrenia , associate increase morbidity mortality . Within early phase schizophrenia , comorbid cannabis use disorder ( CUD ) , common comorbid disorder ( approximately 50 % ) , appear link poor outcome patient , may factor long-term deterioration . While data indicate first episode patient present comorbid CUD earlier onset illness poor outcome without CUD , continue cannabis use antipsychotic treatment , occur approximately 50 % patient initial month hospitalization , associate even bad outcome . The apparent `` toxicity '' cannabis use first episode patient parallel data chronic patient , CUD associate clinical exacerbation , non-compliance treatment , poor global functioning , increase relapse . A grow body data suggest critical period exist patient schizophrenia early phase psychosis symptom function continue worsen , treatment antipsychotic medication period may improve natural course disorder . While availability novel antipsychotic medication spark research early phase schizophrenia , study include clozapine ( CLOZ ) . We hypothesize CLOZ may effective novel agent control cannabis use patient first episode schizophrenia comorbid CUD . We postulate standard antipsychotic medication decrease substance use population largely restore normal function dysfunctional dopamine ( DA ) pathways . CLOZ , contrast , varied action dopaminergic , serotonergic , particularly , noradrenergic neuron , couple weak D2 potent noradrenergic alpha2 block ability , may tend `` normalizing '' effect signal detection capability dysfunctional DA system . CLOZ rarely use first episode patient even though generally consider highly effective medication , likely prevent relapse typical antipsychotic treatment refractory non-refractory population . While side effect CLOZ clinical concern need take seriously , experience past 2 decade increase comfort level use . For example , agranulocytosis actually occur 0.37 % implementation require white count monitoring system , granulocyte stimulate therapy provide effective treatment patient develop agranulocytosis . Gradual dose titration schedule appear reduce risk seizure myocarditis , experience first episode patient suggest clinically effective dose CLOZ low chronic patient indicate risk even low . If hypothesis correct , CLOZ , despite side effect profile , may key therapeutic role patient , role important public health implication . Yet without clear demonstration benefit/risk benefit/burden profile use , naturalistic experiment assess overall effectiveness CLOZ first episode patient comorbid CUD unlikely undertaken . This study enrol individual first episode schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder currently use cannabis . Study participant undergo screen visit include Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV diagnostic evaluation , physical examination , blood test , review medical , psychiatric , substance use history . Following screen visit , eligible participant randomly assign single-blind treatment clozapine risperidone 24 week . Participants assign clozapine initially receive daily dose 12.5 mg , carefully titrate low dose necessary manage psychotic symptom well tolerate . Participants assign risperidone initially receive 0.5 mg daily carefully titrate fashion . Cross titration previous antipsychotic ( ) onto study medication complete within 2-4 week . Participants clozapine weekly blood test . Concomitant medication minimize keep stable throughout protocol except need manage side effect urgent clinical symptom . Study medication , psychiatric visit , assessment labwork provide without charge participant . Study visit take place week . At study visit , medication side effect , physical psychiatric symptom , substance use , treatment service receive assessed . A Lifestyle Intervention also provide help prevent metabolic side-effects vulnerable population , assist recovery . The investigator meet weekly review clinical care manage variation study protocol .</detailed_description>
