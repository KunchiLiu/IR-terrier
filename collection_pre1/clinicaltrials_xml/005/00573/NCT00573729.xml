	<brief_summary>Port wine stain congenital , progressive vascular malformation human skin . The pulsed dye laser approve Food Drug Administration treatment choice . However , degree port wine stain blanch see follow pulsed dye laser treatment remain variable unpredictable . If ultimate standard require complete lesion blanching , average success rate 10 % , even undergo numerous pulse dye laser treatment . Moreover , less 50 % patient achieve 50 % fade Port wine stain response pulse dye laser therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulsed Dye Laser Treatment Port Wine Stain Birthmarks : Comparison 577 nm Versus 595 nm Wavelengths</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The researcher ' specific aim determine whether use pulse dye laser operate wavelength 577 nm improve therapeutic outcome compare pulsed dye laser operate 595 nm . The researcher treat port wine stain treat use pulse dye laser operate wavelength 577 nm half wavelength 595 nm . The researcher determine 577 nm pulse dye laser improve port wine stain blanching response area treat 595 nm . The degree port wine stain blanch determine visible reflectance spectroscopy skin image device measurement . Post-treatment blanching response compare pre-treatment measurement port wine stain fractional blood volume .</detailed_description>
