	<brief_summary>Women suffer disproportionately men Cardiac Syndrome X ( chest pain absence flow limit coronary artery stenosis ) . Coronary microvascular disease hypothesize mediate chest pain syndrome . This disorder small heart vessel ( arteriole ) compare large vessel ( artery ) diagnose routine heart catheterization . This result delay diagnosis , missed opportunity treatment , likely contributes increase death rate coronary heart disease woman compare men . Current test small vessel disease perform cardiac catheterization laboratory use specialized testing perform routinely . Accordingly , woman condition either falsely reassure , misdiagnosed another non-cardiac condition . Unnecessary healthcare cost related re-hospitalization repeat angiography incur , woman often initiated appropriate lifesaving treatment . We others demonstrate randomize controlled trial therapy target endothelium , e.g . statin , ACE inhibitor , exercise effective condition . Majority woman Cardiac Syndorme X go undiagnosed . Recent study show significant increase health care cost , morbidity mortality relate disease . It become important characterize group patient hope study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Aims : 1 . To establish prevalence microvascular disease woman men Cardiac Syndrome X 2 . To study predictive value utility noninvasive test like Peripheral Artery Tonometry ( PAT ) Cardiac Magnetic Resonance ( CMR ) diagnose Cardiac Syndrome X . 3 . To establish prognosis woman men Cardiac Syndrome X . 4 . To elucidate risk factor , clinical feature , diagnostic method , treatment , prognosis patient microvascular angina ( MVA ) . With research study , want specifically study group patient chest pain sign symptom suggestive heart disease n't visible blockage large heart artery . Patients chest pain undergo heart catheterization blockage large heart artery consent enrolled . Patients ask fill questionnaire medical history , include family , reproductive , social history . They also ask undergo test heart catheterization would test abnormality small heart artery use medication , acetylcholine adenosine . This test standard care procedure give discretion treat physician . Patients would receive test whether participate research . The test perform infuse acetylcholine adenosine catheter use routine heart catheterization . This test may add additional 15 minute heart catheterization procedure . In addition , patient ask undergo non-invasive test call Peripheral Arterial Tonometry PAT research purpose case , clinically indicated Cardiac Magnetic Resonance ( CMR ) image test standard care . Patients follow use phone questionnaire 6 month annually thereafter . It propose problem function large small artery may responsible give patient symptoms chest pain put risk heart attack . PAT may help u easily non-invasively measure function test artery arm . Selected patient also undergo CMR imaging may useful detect abnormality inner layer heart muscle result abnormal function large small heart artery . These non-invasive test corroborate result invasive test heart catheterization , consider gold standard test function large small heart artery . The three test ( heart catheterization adenosine coronary flow reserve test , acetylcholine provocative vasomotor test heart catheterization , cardiac MRI ) perform standard care . Blood urine collection add protocol secondary outcome future test test whether impaired Endothelial Progenitor Cell ( EPC ) number relate presence severity microvascular disease . Results study help confirm need test patient chest pain open large artery heart catheterization abnormality function large small heart artery , validate usefulness use non-invasive technique like PAT CMR detect problem . The study also help confirm increase risk heart attack associate abnormal function large small artery patient . Subjects ask interested receive information Pro00015124 ( repository/collection ) . If interested , consented Pro00015124 . No specimen collect part study forward Pro00015124 .</detailed_description>
