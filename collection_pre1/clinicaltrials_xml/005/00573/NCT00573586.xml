	<brief_summary>This investigational study use high intensity focus ultrasound ( HIFU ) management localized prostate cancer ( T1c/T2a ) primary non-comparative study . High intensity focus ultrasound ( HIFU ) non-invasive acoustic ablation technique use intersect , precision focus ultrasound wave raise temperature target ) 80-90 degree C 2-3 second , destroy target tissue ( prostate cancer ) . The tissue target highly precise , minimize collateral damage . The overall hypothesis HIFU Sonablate safely , effectively selectively ablate prostate cancer tissue , result complete tissue necrosis , patient diagnose localized T1c/T2a prostate cancer , minimal morbidity . The specific hypothesis Sonablate ability : - Completely destroy prostate cancer tissue , without cause damage intervene tissue , drop PSA level &lt; 0.5ng/ml . - Result negative biopsy evidence viable malignant cell treatment ( 12 month Nadir reach PSA rise Nadir ) - Safely treat localized prostate cancer patient , minimal acceptable adverse effect</brief_summary>
