	<detailed_description>Low-dose Oral Imatinib Treatment Scleroderma Pulmonary Involvement : Phase II pilot study . Background rationale Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ; scleroderma ) rare , multisystem connective tissue disease characterise widespread microvascular lesion increase deposition matrix component skin internal organ , vary degree severity . The incidence scleroderma appear increase 0.6 new case annually per million 1947 19 new case annually 1991 . The median survival calculate approximately 60 % 5 year 50 % 10 year . The U.S. collaborative study report 12 year survival 30 % . Moreover , patient scleroderma double standardized incidence ratio ( SIR ) develop cancer compare general population . The burden National Health System relevant , cost Euro 2.900 five-days hospitalization per patient annual indirect cost Euro 2.066 per patient . Unfortunately , despite advance therapy single clinical manifestation scleroderma , proven disease-modifying intervention exist patient time . Therapy symptomatic consist vasodilator , steroid , anti-secretive agent effective immunosuppressive therapy consist mainly high-dose cyclophosphamide associate serious side effect . Our purpose treat scleroderma skin pulmonary fibrosis use therapeutic strategy base pathogenetic mechanism . The etiology disease unknown , abnormal oxidative stress implicate pathogenesis scleroderma link fibroblast activation . Platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) seem stimulator production reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) key cell transducer fibroblast proliferation collagen gene expression . In detail , observe ROS generation strictly relate Ha-Ras , growth-factor activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 ( Ha-Ras , ERK1/2 ) , Ha-Ras- ERK1/2-ROS circuitry amplify scleroderma fibroblast . In fact , over-expression Ha-Ras ERK 1/2 high ROS level induce collagen gene transcription senescence normal fibroblast 6 . Since platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) induce ROS Ras-ERK1/2 signal since IgG derive scleroderma patient ( SSc IgG ) react human fibroblast , Svegliati co-worker seek Ha-Ras-ERK1/2 ROS stimulatory molecule serum scleroderma patient provide evidence serum scleroderma patient contain stimulatory IgG autoantibody direct PDGF receptor ( PDGFR ) 5 . These autoantibody trigger PDGFR , induce ROS via Ha-Ras ERK 1/2 signal ultimately responsible fibroblast activation , distinctive feature scleroderma 5 . Pulmonary involvement present considerable part patient characterize typical interstitial lung disease . Most patient present bilateral basal alveolitis evolve diffuse fibrosis restrictive respiratory failure . Lung fibrosis pulmonary hypertension main cause death systemic sclerosis . Imatinib mesylate ( STI571 Gleevec ) specific inhibitor fusion protein Bcr-Abl , causal agent chronic myelogenous leukaemia . Other target ATP-binding site tyrosine kinases PDGF , PDGF-receptor , c-Kit , SCF . Daniels coll . investigated role TGF-beta-induced fibrosis mediate activation Abelson ( Abl ) tyrosine kinase , use mouse model bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis , find significant inhibition lung fibrosis imatinib . Since imatinib mesylate exerts selective , dual inhibition transform growth factor beta ( TGFbeta ) platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) pathways recent study undertaken test potential use imatinib mesylate antifibrotic drug also treatment dermal fibrosis systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) . The author find imatinib biologically relevant concentration potent antifibrotic effect vitro vivo , without toxic side effect . They conclude favorable pharmacokinetics clinical experience use disease , imatinib mesylate promising candidate treatment fibrotic disease SSc . Moreover Platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) potent smooth muscle cell mitogen may contribute smooth muscle hyperplasia development chronic pulmonary hypertension selective PDGF inhibition may provide novel therapeutic strategy treatment chronic PH . Pulmonary arterial hypertension , disorder limit pulmonary circulation , characterize pulmonary vascular obstruction variable pulmonary vasoconstriction lead increase pulmonary vascular resistance death . Pulmonary hypertension frequent complication lung fibrosis systemic sclerosis , also occur without overt fibrotic pulmonary involvement particular limited form scleroderma . The PDGF receptor antagonist STI571 ( imatinib ) reverse advanced pulmonary vascular disease 2 animal model pulmonary hypertension regardless initiate stimulus use successfully single patient resistant conventional therapy . Actually , approve treatment chronic myelogenous leukemia 7 progress malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor ; since alter PDGF signal play important role skin pulmonary fibrosis , Imatinib therapeutic potential treatment disorder accompany overexpression growth factor . Since fibrotic complication disfigure responsible great suffering mortality , expect drug confer substantial benefit patient scleroderma . Objectives study The specific objective study verify effect tolerability new therapy pulmonary skin fibrosis patient affect systemic sclerosis . This therapy base upon recent data regard pathogenesis scleroderma intend interfere PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity play central role type I collagen gene expression . The propose action follow objective : 1. strengthen national network compose centre train use experimental drug disease , special focus development uniform criterion outcome evaluation , enforcement communication channel , creation strategic synergy future , idea , project data exchange ; 2. training young investigator ; 3. sharing advance experimental technique 'rare ' biological sample improve knowledge pathogenesis scleroderma , avoid well costly overlap . Type Study To evaluate effect Imatinib treatment study follow 'Simon 's optimal two-stage design ' . This typical Phase II design , whose aim limit number subject undergo ineffective therapy . This design consist two subsequent enrolment phase . Ten patient ( variable : n1 ) enter study first stage trial . Their outcome evaluate six month experimental therapy . If few 10 % good response ( variable : P0 ) , accrual terminate drug reject little interest . Otherwise , accrual continue total 30 patient ( variable : n ) . All patient undergo experimental treatment outcome evaluation . At end study drug reject observed response rate le 30 % ( variable : P1 ) evaluable patient . Variables n1 , n , P0 , P1 calculate provide design probability 0.05 less accept drug bad P0 first stage probability 0.2 less reject drug well P1 end study . A comparison historical control ( SSc lung disease underwent immunosuppressive treatment ) also perform . Seventy-five historical control need probability 80 % high reveal true difference &gt; 20 % ( favour experimental drug ) , hypothesize good response rate 0.1 less control population ( one-sided , alpha=0,05 ) 3 .</detailed_description>
