	<brief_summary>In pilot study , investigator propose characterize pattern activation kynurenine pathway tryptophan metabolism peripheral macrophage patient schizophrenia . To , investigator measure gene expression several major enzyme pathway macrophage , include key enzyme involve tryptophan kynurenine metabolism , IDO , mean quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . The focus enzyme mRNA expression oppose serum cerebrospinal fluid level metabolites provide possibly sensitive characterization activation metabolic pathway .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In pilot study , propose characterize pattern activation kynurenine pathway tryptophan metabolism peripheral macrophage patient schizophrenia . To , measure gene expression several major enzyme pathway macrophage , include key enzyme involve tryptophan kynurenine metabolism , IDO , mean quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . The focus enzyme mRNA expression oppose serum cerebrospinal fluid level metabolites provide possibly sensitive characterization activation metabolic pathway . Primary hypothesis : We hypothesize patient schizophrenia differ expression macrophage IDO mRNA , reflect activation pathway compare normal . We hypothesize patient deficit syndrome high degree enzyme activation . Secondary hypothesis : Serum tryptophan level low patient schizophrenia compare control , correlate measure dysphoria . Serum kynurenine level elevate patient schizophrenia , particularly deficit syndrome patient . mRNA expression level enzymes downstream IDO differ patient control . Measures immune activation influence medical disease burden ( medical comorbidities ) .</detailed_description>
