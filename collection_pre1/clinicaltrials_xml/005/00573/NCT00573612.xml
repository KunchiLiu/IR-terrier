	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia ( FMS ) , define presence chronic widespread pain find 11/18 tender point examination , affect 2 % general population . Drug therapy FMS largely symptomatic yet complete understand pathogenesis disease . In past 17 year , supervise aerobic exercise emerge important treatment modality improve pain , aerobic capacity , function , well-being . Individuals able adhere exercise almost always maintain symptomatic benefit exercise . Unfortunately , rate exercise adherence six month completion well-structured supervised exercise program disappointingly low . Furthermore , although efficacy supervise aerobic exercise research set well document , applicability intervention clinic set doubtful . Therefore , propose conduct Research Encourage Exercise Fibromyalgia ( REEF ) , randomize attention-controlled trial whose primary aim evaluate efficacy telephone-delivered motivational interviewing ( MI ) encourage exercise , improve exercise adherence self-report physical function ( co-primary outcome measure ) FMS patient . REEF enroll 200 FMS patient , randomize either MI group attention-control ( AC ) group . Participants group receive total 6 telephone call within 12-week period . Prior phone call , participant group receive individualize exercise prescription 2 supervise exercise training session get start exercise program . All subject undergo comprehensive outcome assessment baseline , week 12 , week 24 , week 36 . The secondary aim proposal determine mediator MI improvement self-report physical function . The propose research significant focus promotion adherence exercise program , adequate intensity , order maximize function well-being patient FMS . The use predominantly home-based exercise program telephone-delivered MI train licensed practice nurse ( LPN ) could potentially make propose intervention accessible great majority FMS patient . Furthermore , proven efficacious , MI could readily apply chronically painful condition ( e.g . chronic back pain ) .</brief_summary>
