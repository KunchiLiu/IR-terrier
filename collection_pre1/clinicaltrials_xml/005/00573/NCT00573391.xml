	<detailed_description>A new drug ( bortezomib [ VelcadeTM PS-341 ] ) show recent study effective subject advance multiple myeloma . There also research show drug may even effective use combination drug use treat myeloma many year ( melphalan , thalidomide , dexamethasone ) . This study do find combination VelcadeTM melphalan dexamethasone ( VMD ) effective , even effective combination thalidomide dexamethasone ( VTD ) .</detailed_description>
