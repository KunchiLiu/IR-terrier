	<criteria>1 . Akinesis dyskinesis due myocardial infarction limit anteroapical region 2 . Diagnosis heart failure minimum 6 month prior enrollment 3 . NYHA Class time enrollment , either : NYHA Class III IV predominant 3month period prior enrollment NYHA Class II diagnose NYHA Class III IV 3month period prior enrollment ≥ 1 hospitalization heart failure 12month period prior enrollment 4 . LVEF ≤ 40 % measure echocardiography 5 . Left ventricle must appropriate anatomy measure Cardiac CT per VPD Implant size criterion describe device 's Instructions For Use 6 . Eligible cardiac surgery 7 . Between 18 74 year age ( inclusive ) 8 . Receiving appropriate medical treatment heart failure accord ACC/AHA 2005 Guideline Update Diagnosis Management Chronic Heart Failure Adult three month prior enrollment 9 . Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ( within 7 day procedure ) must agree attempt become pregnant course study 10 . Provide write informed consent 11 . Agree protocolrequired followup 1 . Myocardial ischemia require PCI CABG 2 . Acute MI ( see MI definition ) within 60 day enrollment patient suspect evolve MI time enrollment 3 . Cardiogenic shock within 72 hour enrollment 4 . Revascularization procedure ( PCI CABG ) within 60 day enrollment 5 . Patient receive CRT device within 60 day enrollment 6 . Patient diagnose significant valve disease ( AI &gt; 1+ ; MR &gt; 2+ ) may may require surgery 7 . Patient receive ICD within 60 day enrollment 8 . Patient receive pacemaker within 60 day enrollment 9 . History abort sudden cardiac death , patient receive ICD potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia , VT VF 10 . Patients history current diagnosis either persistent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation well patient present contraindication oral anticoagulant therapy 11 . Aortic valve replacement repair 12 . Resting systolic blood pressure 180 mmHg less 90 mmHg 13 . Resting heart rate 120 bpm 14 . Cardiac CT echocardiographic evidence thrombus leave ventricle leave atrium 15 . History bleed diathesis major coagulopathy ( i.e . platelet count &lt; 100,000 plts/ml whole blood ; PTT PT &gt; 1.3 time control value ) 16 . GI bleed require transfusion within past 3 month 17 . Patient suffer stroke within past 6 month 18 . Evidence severe calcification VPD Implant attachment zone 19 . Evidence significant subaortic obstruction ( `` leave moderator band '' ) area implant 20 . History Kawasaki 's disease 21 . Patient receive heart , lung , liver and/or kidney transplant 22 . Patient dialysis expect require hemodialysis within 12 month 23 . Patient chronic liver disease 24 . Patient receive intracardiac gene therapy stem cell therapy 25 . Creatinine &gt; 2.5mg/dl impaired renal function place patient risk contrast induce renal failure 26 . Hypersensitivity contrast medium 27 . Allergy contraindication clopidogrel aspirin 28 . Evidence ongoing infection ( fever temperature &gt; 38°C and/or WBC &gt; 15,000 ) 29 . Comorbidities associate life expectancy le 12months factor make echo clinical followup difficult ( permanent address , etc . ) 30 .
