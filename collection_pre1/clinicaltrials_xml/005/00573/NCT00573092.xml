	<brief_summary>High blood pressure one common health problem United States . There many drug treatment option high blood pressure , medication always effective . People treat high blood pressure still suffer serious cardiovascular health problem , include heart attack , sudden death , stroke . Genetic variation may cause people susceptible cardiovascular outcome despite treatment . This study identify new gene region may influence effectiveness high blood pressure drug prevent mention cardiovascular condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analyzing Gene Regions That May Interact With Effectiveness High Blood Pressure Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High blood pressure affect nearly one three individual United States . There many factor cause high blood pressure , include family history genetic trait , kidney disease , stress , diabetes , diet . If leave untreated , high blood pressure increase one 's risk stroke , heart attack , heart failure . There four major class drug use treat high blood pressure , include diuretic , beta blocker , angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , calcium antagonist . Each class work differently treat high blood pressure , certain gene region may affect effectiveness various high blood pressure drug . The purpose study identify new gene region may influence effectiveness four major high blood pressure drug type prevent heart attack , sudden death , stroke . This study draw upon specimen data three large population-based study : Group Health population , Cardiovascular Heart Study , Jackson Heart Study . New sample DNA laboratory data collect participant Group Health population . The remain sample pre-existing sample two study . Through whole-genome study DNA sample , researcher distinguish genomic region interest four major drug class identify association drug gene population . Researchers genotype `` interesting '' genomic region discover whole-genome study . Ethnic-specific genetic variation also identify fully characterize genetic variation . The study replicate assess validity finding .</detailed_description>
