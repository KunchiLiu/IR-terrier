	<brief_summary>In past two decade great stride make understand biological change result spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . The future hold promise development therapy promote degree repair recovery function people live SCI . Lessons learn past `` fail '' SCI clinical trial , however , demonstrate , order accurately evaluate overall effectiveness SCI therapy , sensitive outcome measure need . Specifically , reflect ultimate goal clinical intervention - induce functional recovery - Spinal Cord Independence Measure ( SCIM ) , recommend test development use measure functional ability future SCI clinical study . The SCIM simple questionnaire score sheet evaluator use determine independently person SCI perform certain task . A panel SCI researcher recommend SCIM suitable among four candidate measure functional recovery review special meeting sponsor National Institute Disability Rehabilitation Research ( NIDRR ) joint meeting American Spinal Injury Association International Spinal Cord Society ( ASIA-ISCoS ) Boston , MA , June 2006 . It recommend large-scale , multi-center , prospective trial conduct United States , would mirror recently publish multi-site international study . The propose research SCIM III , late sensitive version SCIM , would test hypothesis SCIM III valid , reliable , sensitive measure functional ability person SCI . Twenty-two rehabilitation center throughout United States enroll maximum 660 subject . Functional ability measure SCIM III first week admittance inpatient acute rehabilitation within one week discharge rehabilitation program . Statistical analysis use test validity , reliability , sensitivity SCIM III . The result demonstrate whether SCIM III suitable outcome measure ass SCI specific functional ability future clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY PURPOSE This clinical research study perform assess validity , reliability , sensitivity Spinal Cord Independence Measure ( SCIM III ) measure functional ability person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . Aims Hypothesis : Overall hypothesis - The SCIM III valid , reliable , sensitive measure functional ability person SCI . Aim 1 : Examine validity SCIM III outcome measure assess functional ability person SCI . 1 . Criterion-related validity 2 . Construct validity component Aim 2 : Examine reliability SCIM III evaluation . 1 . Inter-rater reliability 2 . Internal consistency Aim 3 : Examine sensitivity SCIM III functional change . 1 . Sensitivity functional change compare Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) . 2 . Sensitivity functional change time STUDY DESIGN This multi-center , prospective clinical research study perform assess validity , reliability , sensitivity Spinal Cord Independence Measure ( SCIM III ) measure functional ability person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . UCI act coordinate center study , collect perform statistical data analysis . There approximately 22 rehabilitation center participate study .
