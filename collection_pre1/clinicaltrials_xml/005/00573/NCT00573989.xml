	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs , pemetrexed erlotinib , may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Erlotinib pemetrexed may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving intensity-modulated radiation therapy together pemetrexed erlotinib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose erlotinib give together intensity-modulated radiation therapy pemetrexed see well work treat patient recurrent second primary head neck cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate acute toxicity feasibility intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) combination radiosensitizing drug pemetrexed disodium erlotinib hydrochloride patient recurrent second primary squamous cell carcinoma head neck . ( Phase I ) - Determine maximum tolerate dose recommended phase II dose erlotinib hydrochloride patient . ( Phase I ) - Determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) 1 year patient . ( Phase II ) Secondary - Determine median PFS , median overall survival ( OS ) , OS 1 2 year patient . - Determine objective tumor response measure CT scan MRI patient . - Evaluate acute chronic toxicity IMRT combination radiosensitizing drug pemetrexed disodium erlotinib hydrochloride patient . - Evaluate impact treatment quality life measure FACT-H &amp; N , PSS-HN , MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory ( MDADI ) , swallow direct functional measurement different time point . - Evaluate level phosphorylation different tyrosine residue within cytoplasmic domain EGFR , bound adaptor , well marker downstream pathway activation nano LC-MS/MS tumor tissue correlate level P-AKT P-ERK immunohistochemistry response treatment . - Measure level TS p53 correlate treatment response . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study erlotinib hydrochloride follow phase II study . - Phase I : Patients undergo intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) daily , 5 day week , 6 week . Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute day 1 radiotherapy . Treatment pemetrexed disodium repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily begin day 1 radiotherapy continue 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Phase II : Patients undergo IMRT receive pemetrexed sodium phase I . Patients also receive erlotinib hydrochloride maximum tolerate dose determined phase I . Quality life assess baseline , weekly treatment , 1 , 6 , 12 month , annually thereafter . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
