	<brief_title>Methadone Versus Morphine Cancer-Related Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment cancer pain base World Health Organization ( WHO ) step ladder approach use analgesic drug . Medication potency increase step WHO ladder , nonopioid ( step 1 ; e.g. , aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) weak opioids ( step 2 ; e.g . codeine ) plus nonopioid strong opioids ( step 3 ; e.g. , morphine ) plus nonopioid analgesic . Morphine consider gold standard treatment moderate severe pain , base level C criterion . Research discover methadone potent opioid operate several level important pain control . The primary aim compare morphine versus methadone first-line analgesic patient moderate severe cancer pain . Patients randomize receive either oral slow-release morphine ( 15 mg ) every 8 hour immediate-release morphine ( 10 mg ) every 4 hour need breakthrough pain oral methadone 2.5 mg every 8 hour methadone 2.5 mg every 4 hour need breakthrough pain . Our hypothesis methadone provide equivalent pain control efficacy 4 week therapy . We postulate methadone preferable morphine analgesic . We compare two drug via adverse effect compare stability analgesia via comparison number breakthrough pain episode . The study attempt establish equivalency methadone first-line analgesic moderate severe cancer pain .</detailed_description>
