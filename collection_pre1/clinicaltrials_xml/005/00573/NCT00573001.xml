	<brief_title>Evaluation 4 New Simplified Antiretroviral Treatments Naive HIV-1 Infected Patients Africa ( ANRS 12115 DAYANA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The efficacy antiretroviral treatment sub-Saharan Africa demonstrate cohort study pilot trial . The treatment regimens test study derive used pre-marketing trial conduct industrialized country . However , choice antiretrovirals national program poor country largely base drug availability Access program , together cost supply consideration , rather field evaluation recommend strategy . Concomitantly development antiretroviral access program southern hemisphere , first-line treatment industrialized country tend become simpler , thereby improve convenience reduce incidence severity adverse effect . These simplify treatment involve few tablet intake , fixed-dose combination , also radically new strategy boost protease inhibitor tenofovir . These simplified strategy extensively evaluate industrialized country . Long-term economic benefit determine factor adoption strategy poor country . Methods : We conduct phase-III unblinded randomise trial focus early virologic efficacy , tolerability immuno-virologic efficacy four simplify antiretroviral regimen give 96 week previously untreated HIV-1-infected patient Senegal Cameroon . The following four simplify treatment test : TDF/FTC/NVP , LPV/TDF , TDF/FTC/AZT TDF/FTC/EFV . The required number patient ( n=120 ) compatible short-term recruitment capacity two clinical investigation center Senegal Cameroon . Objective : The goal trial demonstrate new treatment effective reference triple-agent regimen ( TDF/FTC/EFV ) drive plasma viral load detection limit early treatment . The principal objective identify simplify treatment capable drive viral load 50 copies/mL week 16 least 50 % patient . If successful , initial treatment continue re-assessed 96 week . Study design : 120 patient previously unexposed antiretroviral drug recruit one-year period two treatment center Dakar ( Infectious Diseases department Fann University Hospital ) Cameroon ( Yaounde Military Hospital Principal Hospital ) Expected result : This study fully keep WHO/UNAIDS recommendation antiretroviral treatment simplification poor country . These new treatment must evaluate country concern , give often advanced stage HIV disease diagnosis , intercurrent health disorder , local socioeconomic condition . This trial design compare new treatment one another , rather select promise treatment future use . These preliminary result help choice treatment strategy cohort study large-scale randomized trial .</detailed_description>
