	<brief_summary>This prospective , multicenter , open-labeled , non-comparative pharmacokinetic study conduct 10 critically ill , anuric patient receive CVVHDF . Enrollment take place 3-5 clinical site United States . A study coordinator site identify institutional specific process ( e.g. , pharmacy record , etc . ) utilized identify patient . Full evaluation inclusion exclusion criterion conduct site 's coordinator within 48 hour initiation daptomycin therapy . Subjects receive daptomycin 6mg/kg ( total body weight ) daily suspected/documented infection , deem necessary treating clinician screen inclusion current study . Dialysate , ultrafiltrate , blood flow rate utilized CVVHDF procedure determine clinician discretion optimize stability patient . Daptomycin sample obtain around third dose attempt achieve approximate steady-state concentration . Pre- post-filter blood sample collect simultaneously dialysate ultrafiltrate specimen multiple time point . Protein bind assessed filtration serum sample peak drug concentration time point .</brief_summary>
