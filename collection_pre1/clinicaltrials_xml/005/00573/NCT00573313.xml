	<brief_summary>Prior study animal model establish pathogenesis alcoholic liver disease ( ALD ) regulate part effect chronic alcohol abuse hepatic methionine metabolism . The hypothesis clinical study provision methionine metabolite S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) would correct abnormal hepatic methionine metabolism thereby effectively treat ALD . The two goal clinical research ) determine clinical relationship aberrant hepatic methionine metabolism ALD comparison pattern serum methionine metabolites group ALD patient , alcoholic without liver disease , normal healthy subject , b ) determine treatment effect SAM pattern serum methionine metabolite histopathology biochemical feature liver injury ALD patient .</brief_summary>

In addition , enrol 26 gender match active alcohol drinker without liver disease ( AD ) 28 age gender match healthy control subject ( HS ) . Of original 40 ALD subject provide initial enrollment data , 3 decline proceed trial . Therefore , 37 ALD patient randomize receive SAM dose 400 mg placebo three time daily 24 week . However 11 drop initial evaluation , leave 26 ALD patient , 13 arm , complete 24 week trial .</detailed_description>
