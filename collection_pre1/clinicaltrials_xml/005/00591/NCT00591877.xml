	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Role Alternative Medicine Difficult Treat GERD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Prevalence burden disease : Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) define presence symptom heartburn and/or acid regurgitation common chronic disorder . It significant health problem especially Western population associate huge economic burden impair quality life ( 1 , 2 ) . The prevalence GERD adult population United States 40 % ( symptoms least month ) . Approximately 20 % report GERD relate symptom weekly 14 % report daily basis . The lead gastrointestinal symptom evaluate primary care office set relate diagnosis GERD . The mainstay treatment GERD symptom present time proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) combination life style change . In fact , PPI become one commonly write prescription , trend suggest per year script double since 1999 . It estimate Americans spend excess 10 billion US dollars/year PPIs two top five selling drug United States PPIs ( 5 ) . For patient prefer refrain long-term medication use , may benefit acid-reflux surgery Nissen fundoplication . However , acid-reflux reducing procedure associate operative morbidity mortality include several complication include gas bloat syndrome . A large number patient undergo surgery reflux symptom may eventually relapse require PPIs . Thus , treatment reflux , either pharmacological surgical , costly ( 6-9 ) present significant economic burden health-care delivery system . Social Impact disease : GERD symptom associate bodily pain , impaired social , emotional physical functioning profound impact daily living . Much research do evaluate true burden GERD society . For instance , 40 % patient nighttime symptom GERD report symptom affected ability function next day . Furthermore , 27 % patient report night-time symptom affect spouse ability sleep ( 10 ) . Clearly , data indicates huge number Americans report effect heartburn personal spousal quality life . GERD symptom need address effectively successful treatment GERD result improvement health relate quality life ( 11 , 12 ) . In treatment GERD , goal complete symptom resolution show associate clinically significant improvement health relate quality life ( HRQL ) ( 13 ) . Refractory GERD : Despite life style change compliant therapy PPI , large number patient may persistent symptom classified refractory GERD , distinctive group difficult manage ( 14 ) . The putative reason remain poorly define likely include contribution factor non-acid reflux , visceral hypersensitivity , abnormal esophageal motor event ( 14 ) . A study Tack et al investigated mechanism poor response PPI therapy show persistence acid reflux 11 % , bile reflux alone 38 % combination acid bile reflux 26 % . However , persistence acid bile reflux prove causal relationship symptom ( 15 ) . Also , group individual acid bile reflux BID PPI 's , possible treatment option Nissen 's fundoplication , utility yet prove cohort . There consensus definition refractory GERD generally , define non-response symptom optimum PPI trial . The goal provide symptomatic relief refractory patient extremely challenge view limit option . It patient investigator would like evaluate feasibility study use complementary medicine modality include acupuncture yoga may relatively safe , cost-effective therapy help distress symptom GERD . Complementary alternative medicine : Complementary alternative medicine ( CAM ) group diverse medical health care system , therapy product presently consider part conventional medicine . These method use century eastern culture myriad group diseases . CAM become popular US 1990 's majority people use complement conventional medicine alternative ( 16-18 ) . Recently , much interest apply modality secondary therapy conventional treatment primary method . Amongst acupuncture yoga gain great deal popularity . Acupuncture ( AC ) : Acupuncture part traditional Chinese medicine complete system heal date back 200 BC . The general theory acupuncture base premise pattern energy flow ( Qi ) body essential health disruption flow believe responsible disease . Studies show AC modulates endorphin system via central pain processing pathway ( 19 , 20 ) . Acupuncture widely use various gastrointestinal disorder . It conceivable acupuncture may effective patient GERD show alter acid secretion , GI motility visceral pain ( 21 , 22 ) . The pathogenesis GERD multifactorial . The predominant mechanism postulate cause GERD transient relaxation lower esophageal sphincter ( TLESR ) . Pathological reflux may also occur due low LES pressure ( 23 ) . Studies show acupoint stimulation decrease rate TLESR 's hence prevents reflux ( 24 ) . The investigator propose use 3 acupoints ST-36 , PC-6 , CV-12 treatment symptom GERD . These point describe subsequent section . Acupuncture perform Dr. Santosh Sharma expertise treatment modality currently offer therapy several year Veterans Affairs Medical Center , Kansas City . Yoga : Yoga refers combination breathe exercise posture design involve specific muscle group systemic effect various organ system . Yoga originate India least 3000 year ago . The practice yoga come US 1890 gain popularity 1960s rise interest cultural acceptance alternative modality mind body therapy . Yoga offer local YWCA , health club yoga center hospital part disease prevention management program ( 25 ) .The popular form Hatha yoga . As discussed , usefulness yoga study certain chronic illness back pain promising result . The investigator propose use yoga exercise specifically design reflux symptom . Dr. Vijay Kumar offer yoga class patient refractory GERD . Dr. Vijay Kumar Professor Computer Science University Missouri - Kansas City offering class several year various level . Evidence use acupuncture yoga : Several randomized control trial conduct demonstrate beneficial effect acupuncture . A randomize control study 29 patient mild moderate ulcerative colitis 4 month follow completion acupuncture session show statistically significant improvement colitis activity index ( CAI ) compare control group . The study conclude acupuncture provide additional therapeutic benefit patient mild moderate ulcerative colitis ( 26 ) . Another randomize 3-arm study conduct assess efficacy safety traditional Chinese acupuncture compare sham acupuncture ( needle define non-acupuncture point ) conservative therapy patient chronic pain due osteoarthritis knee . Addition acupuncture lead significant improvement symptom ( 27 ) . Recently , Dickman et al evaluate efficacy add acupuncture ( twice week 4 week ) compare double PPI dose 30 refractory GERD patient ( 28 ) . The acupuncture group demonstrate significant decrease mean daytime heartburn score compare high-dose PPI group . Mean nighttime heartburn regurgitation score improved acupuncture group . Thus study show add acupuncture compare double PPI dose effective controlling symptom GERD patient standard dose PPI . Similar benefit demonstrate use yoga . A randomized control trial compare yoga , exercise self care book chronic low back pain show yoga effective self-care book improve function reduce chronic low back pain benefit persist least several month ( 29 ) . Yoga also find useful improve symptom relate irritable bowel randomize trial conduct Canada ( 30 ) . CLINICAL RELEVANCE OF THIS STUDY GERD well known , widely prevalent , clinical entity . The symptom GERD relieve affect daily functioning/productivity individual . This especially frustrating patient , may spend hundred dollar every year prescription medication , still able obtain relief symptom . In United States alone , estimate PPI cost alone make $ 10billion/year ( 5 ) . However , despite stagger cost , clear even PPI therapy definitive answer patient . Indeed , report 37 % patient receive PPIs also note concomitant antacid use . This finding underscore fact even PPI therapy , large percentage patient achieve full symptom relief . When left untreated -- treat inadequately -- severe GERD progress esophagitis , esophageal ulcer , esophageal stricture , laryngeal disease , chronic cough , Barrett 's esophagus , esophageal adenocarcinoma . Clearly , patient refractory symptoms one dire need additional modality therapy . Yoga acupuncture may promise option patient , represent cost-effective , yet underused , option may usefully employ control symptom GERD . Data Collection : Patient demographic , order randomization , responses questionnaire , antacid use collect study coordinator record database . RISK AND BENEFIT TO THE STUDY PARTICIPANT : This pilot prospective study potential identify new treatment GERD symptom . The participant study may experience relief GERD symptom persistent high dose acid suppressive therapy . This may improve quality life level functioning . The risk study group minimal . There minor risk bruising , needle breakage infection acupuncture needle musculoskeletal symptom patient undergo yoga . If study show significant improvement reflux symptom acupuncture yoga , method may wider application entire spectrum GERD symptom prospect avoid pharmacologic surgical therapy . STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS : Data Analysis : Data analyze help statistical software program . Categorical continuous variable compare use Student 's t-test chi-square test . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
