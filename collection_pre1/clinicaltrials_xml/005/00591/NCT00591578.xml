	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Comparison Azilsartan Medoxomil Valsartan Participants With Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension affect approximately 50 million individual United States . As population age , prevalence hypertension continue increase broad effective preventive measure implement . According World Health Organization ( WHO ) , hypertension common attributable cause preventable death develop nation , uncontrolled hypertension greatly increase risk cardiovascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , renal failure . Despite availability antihypertensive treatment , hypertension remain inadequately control ; one-third patient continue maintain control successfully . This study conduct determine whether administration azilsartan medoxomil subject essential hypertension efficacious reduce systolic blood pressure valsartan . Study participation anticipate approximately 7 month . Outside study center , participant require wear ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device 24 hour interval . Following completion 6-month double-blind treatment period , available subject offer option continue 28-week extension study open-label azilsartan medoxomil 40 mg. For extension study , participant take azilsartan medoxomil 40 mg , tablet , orally , daily 28 week . Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg 25 mg antihypertensive ( except angiotensin II receptor blocker ) may add step-wise fashion maintain blood pressure within target &lt; 140/90 mmHg non-diabetic subject &lt; 130/80 mmHg diabetic subject</detailed_description>
