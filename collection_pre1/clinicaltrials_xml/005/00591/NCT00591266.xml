	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Azilsartan Medoxomil , Once Daily ( QD ) , Co-Administered With Amlodipine Participants With Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension affect approximately 50 million individual United States . As population age , prevalence hypertension continue increase broad effective preventive measure implement . According World Health Organization , hypertension common attributable cause preventable death develop nation , uncontrolled hypertension greatly increase risk cardiovascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , renal failure . Despite availability antihypertensive treatment , hypertension remain inadequately control ; one third patient continue maintain control successfully . A major component blood pressure regulation renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system , system hormone-mediated feedback interaction result relaxation constriction blood vessel response various stimulus . Angiotensin II , polypeptide hormone , form angiotensin I reaction catalyze angiotensin-converting enzyme part renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system . Angiotensin II principal pressor agent renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system myriad effect cardiovascular system electrolyte homeostasis . Takeda Global Research &amp; Development Center , Inc. develop TAK-491 ( azilsartan medoxomil ) treat patient essential hypertension . Azilsartan medoxomil prodrug hydrolyze active moiety , azilsartan , selective antagonist angiotensin II type 1 receptor subtype . Amlodipine slow-channel blocker inhibits transmembrane influx calcium ion vascular smooth muscle cardiac muscle . It peripheral arterial vasodilator act directly vascular smooth muscle cause reduction peripheral vascular resistance reduction blood pressure . This study conduct determine whether administration azilsartan medoxomil combination amlodipine participant uncontrolled hypertension efficacious reduce systolic blood pressure amlodipine alone . Participation study anticipate approximately 10 week .</detailed_description>
