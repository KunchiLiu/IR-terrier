	<brief_summary>The role teleradiology far reach implication health remote underserved population . The ability coordinate radiographic evaluation diagnosis distance potential raise standard patient care throughout world . Perhaps safe cost effective mode teleradiology today telesonography . The current project attempt determine extent telesonography improve standard care within rural government-run primary clinic within Dominican Republic . The work report herein intend compare use telesonography current standard sonographic examination ( referral government hospital 60km target clinic ) . The study conduct randomly assign 100 patient clinical indication sonographic examination experimental control group . Following 60-day implementation period , follow research question address : 1 ) To extent use asynchronous telesonography increase percentage definitive diagnosis base total number scan ( definitive diagnosis / total number scan ) ? 2 ) To extent use asynchronous telesonography increase continuity care patient ? 3 ) To extent elapsed time scan final radiological interpretation decrease use asynchronous telesonography ? This study also look history telemedicine / telesonography dissemination mainstream practice medicine , explore training protocol may use assist others establish new telesonography program develop nation , discus advance persistent barrier implementation telesonography program . Hypothesis : The use store-and-forward telesonography system set increase speed number final diagnosis per scan receive target clinic increase continuity care increase number speed follow-up appointment target clinic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Telesonography Adaptation Use Improve Standard Patient Care Within Dominican Community</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim project comparable diagnostic imaging goal WHO include 1 ) make safe reliable diagnostic imaging service available many possible ; 2 ) advise , guide support work field develop maintain diagnostic imaging service ; 3 ) promote importance safe appropriate diagnostic imaging service ( WHO , 2007 ) . This project use teleultrasound rapidly diagnose rule-out abdominal , retroperitoneal , pelvic pathology within sole government-run ambulatory clinic Veron , Dominican Republic . The clinic 's patient record well expert opinion clinic 's physician indicate need diagnostic modality . These source indicate number individual symptomologies suggestive abdominal , retroperitoneal , pelvic pathology include fever , abdominal pain , abdominal tenderness , abnormal menses , etc . ( see appendix D ) . Given large number construction project transportation accident within area , uncommon individual present blunt abdominal trauma . Combine reason patient indication clinic 's remote location difficulty and/or resistance member within community undergo timely radiological evaluation , utility telesonography become immediately recognizable . If use telesonography within set show feasible work , future project center education native Dominican health care provider regard use long-term operation telesonography . This study could serve gateway permanent establishment high-quality telesonography within region DR . This project could also serve augment medical technological knowledge native health care worker visit U.S. medical student . This study contribute body knowledge telesonography determine extent technology improve standard patient care within set . The result study implication practice medicine within Veron similar setting within develop world . The development telesonography within set important may improve efficiency health care increase diagnosis , decrease time diagnosis , increase continuity care . While pilot study focus mainly transabdominal evaluation abdominal , retroperitoneal , pelvic structure , long-term use telesonography clinic could expand include regular fetal monitoring , vascular study , perhaps interventional procedure grant clinic physician provide appropriate training . Given majority health disparity within DR related maternal , pre/perinatal , circulatory pathology , use telesonography target specific abnormality ultimate goal continue telemedical presence .</detailed_description>
