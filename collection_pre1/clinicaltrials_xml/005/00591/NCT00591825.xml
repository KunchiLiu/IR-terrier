	<brief_title>fMRI Study Examining Effects D-cycloserine Specific Phobia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exposure Response Prevention ( ERP ) therapy become treatment choice specific phobia . ERP involve systematic repeat exposure fear anxiety-provoking stimulus , lead habituation extinction fear response . Animal model fear extinction show acute administration D-cycloserine ( DCS ) prior exposure fear stimulus enhances extinction fear . A recent study human subject height phobia ( specific phobia ) also demonstrate DCS facilitates effect ERP therapy . Current theory postulate DCS facilitates fear extinction enhance learn process increase consolidation memory , neural mechanism underlie process understood . The propose research aim elucidate mechanism use fMRI measure brain activation 1 ) symptom provocation verbal learn two hour post-medication , 2 ) repeat symptom provocation verbal recognition one week post-medication . This research also examine effect DCS cognitive function use neuropsychological test two house one week post-medication .</detailed_description>
