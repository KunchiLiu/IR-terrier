	<brief_title>Brain Oxygenation Hemodynamics During Sleep Obstructive Sleep Apnea Sufferers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Frequency domain near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) offer advantage perform safe , non-invasive , transcranial , quantitative measurement brain oxygenation hemodynamics real-time . These characteristic make NIRS ideal tool study physiological pathological process brain , setting range research diagnostic laboratory intensive care unit operate room . Scientists recently develop first commercially available absolute near-infrared oximeter , call OxiplexTS . This portable device use study brain vascular autoregulatory response ( response hypoxia hypercapnia ) person obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . These response allow assessment brain vascular health . The OxiplexTS device beneficial identifying person risk cerebrovascular disease . Polysomnography ( PSG ) , currently use ass sleep disorder , give important information function different system , however , provide information brain oxygenation hemodynamics sleep . The assessment factor , via NIRS , person OSA crucial high prevalence disorder significant cardio/cerebrovascular health risk represent . The specific aim trial make OxiplexTS clinically usable instrument , especially research clinical diagnosis monitoring sleep disorder . An additional goal determine usefulness instrument provide measurement various clinical situation include intensive care management prolong surgical procedure , cardiothoracic surgery require critical information brain oxygenation hemodynamics . This trial emerge previous phase I phase II study determine feasibility use OxiplexTS ass brain vascular autoregulatory response hypoxic stimulus . Approximately 300 participant recruited pool healthy individual , individual OSA , volunteer undergo overnight diagnostic therapeutic PSG suspect OSA . Participants divide two group : healthy control person OSA . Both group undergo standard overnight sleep study PSG . In addition standard PSG ( without Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) ) , study researcher add OxiplexTS—allowing ass brain oxygenation hemodynamics sleep . The hemodynamic pattern healthy control compare person OSA . Participants OSA undergo PSG/CPAP test OxiplexTS , well . Their PSG PSG/CPAP data compare .</detailed_description>
