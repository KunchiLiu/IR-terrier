	<detailed_description>Stage I Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Lung cancer frequent cause cancer death men woman North America , account approximately 13 % cancer diagnose 28 % cancer death . There estimate 173,770 new lung cancer case United States year 2004 estimate 160,440 death due lung cancer.1 Seventy-five percent patient bronchogenic carcinoma diagnose non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The number patient early localize disease ( currently estimate 15-20 % NSCLC patient ) 2 expect rise next several year due widespread screen CT scanning . The treatment choice stage I ( T1-T2N0 ) NSCLC surgical resection result 5-year survival rate approximately 60 70 % .3-5 Occasionally , however , patient early-stage NSCLC unable tolerate surgical resection postoperative recovery period due various comorbidities . While conventionally fractionate radiation therapy utilized nonsurgical therapy medically inoperable patient , close observation specific cancer therapy also advocate highly select case . McGarry , et . al. , review outcomes 75 patient receive specific cancer therapy stage I NSCLC , cause death progressive cancer 53 % case median survival time 14.2 ± 2.4 months.6 Definitive conventionally fractionate RT early-stage NSCLC consider reasonable non-surgical therapy yield poor 5-year survival rate range 10 30 % .7-11 Several study suggest dose-response relationship reporting benefit dose escalation standard conventionally fractionate 4,500 6,600 cGy . This benefit evident survival local control patients.10-14 Sibley , et . al. , review 156 medically inoperable patient stage I NSCLC treat primary RT Duke University 1980 1995 . They report 5-year , cause-specific survival rate 32 % . There trend toward improved survival patient achieve local control approach significance high RT dos ( p = 0.07 ) .13 At institution , publish series treat 56 patient medically inoperable NSCLC median dose 70 Gy use conformal radiotherapy techniques.15 Actuarial local control rate 69 % 63 % two- three year follow , respectively . These data serve estimate statistical power calculation trial . Radiation field historically encompass primary tumor well regional lymphatics ipsilateral hilum mediastinum . This elective treatment base identify risk occult lymph node involvement range 20 % surgical series.16 In recent year , elimination elective nodal irradiation , potentially poorly tolerate population,17 validate several retrospective study permit treatment primary tumor alone limit fields.18-21 Slotman , et . al. , study Netherlands , report use limited `` postage-stamp '' field treat early stage lung cancer patient use hypofractionated RT ( i.e. , 4,800 cGy 400-cGy fraction ) . Reported 3-year overall disease-specific survival rate 42 % 76 % , respectively.20 Most aforementioned retrospective study utilize radiotherapy equipment era 1-D 2-D treatment planning . Several limitation evident old technique , include target visualization , selection beam direction , computational algorithm describe deposit dose . Recent improvement software , hardware , computer process speed revolutionize delivery radiation dose appropriate tumor cell kill . In new era three-dimensional treatment planning , precise delivery method available allow dose escalation target volume without excessive dose deposit normal tissue . The RTOG complete extensive dose escalation study conventionally fractionate three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy ( 3D-CRT ) NSCLC stag I , II , III disease long detectable tumor encompass radiation therapy field include primary tumor regional lymph nodes.22 No mechanism minimize lung tumor movement utilized . One hundred seventy-nine patient treat radiation dos escalate high 90.3 Gy . Patients stratify within dose level accord percentage total lung volume receive &gt; 20 Gy treatment plan ( V20 ) . For patient receive radiation alone radiation follow induction chemotherapy , data RTOG 9311 establish radiation dose could safely escalate use 3D-CRT technique 83.8 Gy patient V20 value &lt; 25 % 77.4 Gy patient V20 value 25 % 36 % , use fraction size 2.15 Gy . Excess mortality observe 90.3 Gy two dose-related death . The incidence grade 3 high acute toxicity le 10 % ; however , grade 3 high late toxicity approximately 15 % . Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) delivery high precision , biologically potent dos radiation tumor chest , abdomen , pelvis . Implementing element 3D-CRT stereotactic targeting , SBRT permit delivery 3-4 high dose fraction total 48-60 Gy good local control low toxicity . A phase I dose escalation trial complete Indiana University treatment medically inoperable patient stage I NSCLC.26 , 27 SBRT administer large dos per fraction extracranial stereotactic body frame , include system decrease breathe motion . The start dose 8 Gy time 3 ( 24 Gy total ) , fraction dose escalate 2 Gy per fraction cohort . The target lesion outline physician designate gross tumor volume ( GTV ) . An additional 0.5 cm axial plane 1.0 cm longitudinal plane add GTV constitute PTV base validation measurement commercially available system.23 , 28 , 29 Typically , 7 10 non-coplanar beam use encompass PTV . Dose prescribe 80 % isodose line . However , high isodoses occur within center target mimic heterogeneous dose profile common intracranial stereotactic radiosurgery . The treatment isocenter identify 3-D coordinate define stereotactically localized vernier attach frame . No skin bony landmark use set treatment isocenter ; however , orthogonal port film use daily basis isocenter verification.30 Separate dose escalation carry independently patient T1 versus T2 small ( ≤ 5 cm ) versus T2 large ( 5-7 cm ) tumor diagnosis . According Indiana University protocol guideline , dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) grade 3 cardiac pulmonary toxicity grade 4 toxicity attribute therapy . Thirty-seven patient treat use standard dose escalation protocol 3 patient cohort minimum 1 month dose level assess toxicity . Patients categorized separate independent dose escalation accord tumor volume , T1 vs. T2 ( ≤ 5 cm ) vs. T2 ( &gt; 5 ≤ 7 cm ) . Grade 3 pneumonitis see dose 14 x 3 = 42 Gy total one T2 patient 7-cm tumor transient grade 3 hypoxia see 16 x 3 = 48 Gy total one patient . Additional patient treated level without toxicity observe . Twenty-one patient mild moderate fibrosis distal treat lesion appear chest x-ray treatment . Nine patient decline element pulmonary function test ( FEV1 , FVC , DLCO , PO2 ) 10-20 % predict return back baseline value follow-up two . The timing onset toxicity generally acute subacute ( &lt; 1 month case ) . The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) reach trial patient T1 tumor small T2 tumor ( ≤ 5 cm ) . Dose-limiting pneumonitis pericarditis occur 2/5 patient large T2 tumor ( &gt; 5 ≤ 7 cm ) dose 24 x 3 = 72 Gy define MTD subgroup 22 x 3 = 66 Gy . Patients treat dose 22 Gy per fraction time three fraction follow 24 month without late toxicity T-stage tumor category . Treatment failure within PTV observe 8 26 patient treated dos 20 x 3 = 60 Gy . However , one local failure occur dos 16 x 3 = 48 Gy lower.31 The data demonstrate solitary lung lesion include early stage NSCLC well control SBRT compare conventional radiation . In addition , reduce volume treatment attractive patient medically inoperable stage I NSCLC may increase risk radiation pneumonitis associate conventional large volume radiation field . SBRT permit dose escalation significantly reduce high-dose treatment volume . The RTOG open May 2004 phase II trial SBRT treatment medically inoperable patient stage I/II non-small cell lung cancer effort determine SBRT could achieve acceptable local control see retrospective series.24 , 26 , 32-38 A secondary objective determine technique achieve acceptable treatment-related toxicity . In trial , patient T1 , T2 ( ≤ 5 cm ) , T3 ( ≤ 5 cm ) , N0 , M0 medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer treat SBRT total 60 Gy 3 fraction 20 Gy 1.5 2 week . This protocol exclude patient T3 tumor involve central chest structure mediastinum well patient T-stage tumor within touch zone proximal bronchial tree . This region define volume 2 cm direction around proximal bronchial tree ( carina , right leave main bronchus , right leave upper lobe bronchus , intermedius bronchus , right middle lobe bronchus , lingular bronchus , right leave low lobe bronchus ) .</detailed_description>
