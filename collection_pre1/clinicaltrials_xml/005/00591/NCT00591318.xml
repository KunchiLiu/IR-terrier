	<brief_summary>Many patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder symptom persist , include hallucination delusion , despite adequate pharmacotherapy antipsychotic drug . Glutamate major excitatory neurotransmitter brain implicate several brain disease . NMDA antagonist drug cause symptom psychosis otherwise normal person . It postulate reduced NMDA receptor mediate neurotransmission lead increase synaptic glutamate . Excessive synaptic concentration glutamate produce excitatory neurotoxicity . Agents reduce excess glutamate activity neuroprotective . This therapeutic strategy apply schizophrenia use compound reduce presynaptic release glutamate otherwise decrease excessive postsynaptic stimulation , include lamotrigine , memantine m-GLU-R2 agonist ( LY354740 ) hypothesize result reduction psychotic symptom . Recently show commonly available antibiotic ( ceftriaxone ) unique neuroprotective function decrease amount extracellular glutamate nervous system tissue increase number glutamate transporter protein . Our clinical experience patient refractory psychosis past Lyme disease indicate patient psychosis may improve IV ceftriaxone therapy . Whether improvement due antimicrobial glutamate effect placebo effect uncertain . In placebo-controlled design , study investigates ability ceftriaxone decrease psychotic symptom patient refractory psychotic disorder . In addition , study examine glutamatergic functional activity treatment use brain imaging magnetic resonance spectroscopy .</brief_summary>
