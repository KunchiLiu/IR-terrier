	<detailed_description>Colitis due Clostridium difficile increasingly recognize serious nosocomial problem . Recommended therapy metronidazole , 500 mg four time daily 10 day . About 80 % patient respond therapy . However , response may delay , case debilitation due diarrhea progress . The 20 % respond tend sicker start , debilitation due diarrhea severe problem . In review medical literature , discover early paper C. difficile colitis emphasize symptomatic therapy 'lomotil ' ( diphenoxylate atropine ) . Treatment suppress diarrhea fell favor late 1970 's theoretical consideration well expel retain bacterial toxin . However , patient affect C. difficile colitis increasingly elderly debilitate , suffer substantial morbidity diarrhea . We show 90-day associated mortality &gt; 20 % . Loperamide standard treatment diarrhea , available counter name , Imodium . Based anecdotal report , drug regard contraindicated patient whose diarrheal disease bacterial . But use widely , generally without diagnosis establish . We propose administer loperamide placebo patient CDAD order determine whether antidiarrheal drug reduces morbidity associate infection . We monitor patient closely observe potential benefit and/or adverse event . In addendum , propose include patient antibiotic-associated diarrheal disease due C. difficile . There many patient antibiotic-associated diarrheal disease test negative C. difficile . We believe patient may benefit loperamide treatment well .</detailed_description>
