	<detailed_description>Detailed Description : Non-thyroidal illness syndrome ( NTIS ) , also refer euthyroid sick syndrome ( ESS ) thyroid allostasis critical illness , tumor , uremia starvation ( TACITUS ) , complex endocrine condition may occur critically ill patient . It associate significantly increase morbidity mortality . NTIS characterise three component may occur single combination : 1. central hypothyroidism ( transient thyrotropic insufficiency ) 2. impaired protein bind thyroid hormone 3. reduced formation T3 increase conversion rT3 ( low-T3-syndrome ) . Despite long lasting research detail NTIS still poorly characterize integrative view . Additionally , lack clinically usable classification . Given fact patient NTIS face poor prognosis , several study conduct past evaluate question possible treatment . However , n't yield unambiguous result , maybe due fact study differentiate among distinct component NTIS . Therefore , study intend develop clear-cut definition classification NTIS order set foundation future therapeutic study . This study recruit critically ill patient treat medical surgical intensive care unit Bergmannsheil University hospital evaluation integrative thyrotropic control follow-up . From data correlation individual prognosis laboratory-defined component NTIS determine . This project intend : 1. deliver prognostical aid providing differentiated classification , 2. contribute standardise , rational inexpensive diagnostical procedure 3. lay foundation future therapeutic trial identify subgroup may benefit therapy .</detailed_description>
