	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate use virtual reality ( VR ) technology Physical Therapy ( PT ) and/or Occupational Therapy ( OT ) patient burn . Due pain many burn patient experience PT/OT , search non-medicinal method decrease pain . The question address : VR use PT/OT help increase Range Motion ( ROM ) decrease pain intensity ? Recovery trauma hinder presence acute pain . Unfortunately burn victim , physical occupational therapy remain area significant evoke pain . PT/OT integral part burn recovery start early course treatment . PT/OT necessary maintain elasticity heal skin thereby promote functional range motion affect joint . If patient unable participate PT/OT due pain , joint contracture occur surgical release contracture become necessary . Although pain PT/OT treat opioids , several drawback use analgesic alone . Side effect , development opioid tolerance , inability drug adequately control pain disadvantage . Supplemental use nonpharmacologic technique , along opioid therapy , find effective reduce pain anxiety . In particular , distraction find useful minimize burn pain ( Miller , 1992 ; Patterson , 1995 ) . Virtual reality , due immersive nature include sight , sound , sometimes touch , may even effective method distraction traditional method video movie interactive video game . To explain non-pharmacologic analgesic effect , investigator propose illusion go virtual world draw patient 's attention . Conscious attention require experience pain ( Chapman Nakamura , 1999 ; Eccleston Crombez , 1999 ) . The interactive nature immersive virtual reality make VR unusually attention grabbing , leave less attention available process incoming pain signal ( Hoffman , Patterson Carrougher , 2000 ) . In 1996 , Hunter Hoffman David Patterson co-originated new technique use immersive virtual reality pain control . Virtual reality familiar format child young adult , grow play videogames . Like videogames , environment stimulate computer . However , virtual reality , visual experience present special stereoscopic goggles . Virtual reality simulation include additional sensory information , sound speaker touch cyber-gloves . Users interact virtual reality environment either keyboard , mouse , specially design device . These system describe `` fully immersive '' user surround virtual reality stimulation . Simulated environment use mimic videogames real-world situation , pilot training , driver training , museum tour , underwater expedition . Researchers find immersive virtual reality distraction reduce patient 's pain rating severe burn wound care 30 % 50 % ( Hoffman , Patterson et al. , 2004 ; Hoffman , Patterson Carrougher , 2000 ) . Patients receive adjunctive VR physical therapy report large reduction amount time spend think pain , pain intensity ( bad pain ) unpleasant find pain ( Hoffman , Patterson , Carrougher Sharar , 2001 ) . In recent fMRI brain scan study , participant report large reduction subjective pain VR compare VR scan . The controlled laboratory fMRI study show VR analgesia accompany large reduction pain-related brain activity ( Hoffman , Richards et al. , 2004 ) . The propose study replicate extend work Hoffman , Patterson colleague . Using similar experimental technique , patient serve control evaluate effect use VR physical therapy/occupational therapy burn care compare VR therapy several session . An imagery scale complete subject prior first session determine correlation imagery score effect VR . This may help identify patient benefit VR future . Prior research show patient respond good others adjunct therapy others . Caregivers may reluctant initiate therapy unless certain beneficial . Kwekkeboom develop test Imaging Ability Questionnaire ( IAQ ) Kids Imaging Ability Questionnaire ( KIAQ ) help determine would benefit type intervention ( Kwekkeboom , Maddox , West , 2000 ) . Participants complete questionnaire prior first VR therapy session . The instrument group exception `` imaging ability '' . Each group complete `` imaging ability '' , one design especially child , adult . The majority research use VR focus child . Children adolescents accustom play video game may easier transition VR world . We interest adult 's ability become engage VR compare child . Potential benefit include : Speedier Physical Rehabilitation Decreased Pain Experience During Necessary Care Decreased Pain Med Requirements Addition Variety Daily Activities Altruistic Benefit Derived From Possible Future Benefit Others .</detailed_description>
