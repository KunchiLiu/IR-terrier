	<brief_title>A Bridging Trial Comparing Org 25969 Reappearance T2 Japanese Caucasian Subjects . Part A : Japanese Subjects ( 19.4.208A ) ( P05956 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For surgical procedure depth neuromuscular block 1-2 twitch TOF-stimulation sufficient avoid unwanted muscular activity . At reappearance T2 , anesthesiologist might decide either give ( another ) maintenance dose rocuronium vecuronium surgery continue , await spontaneous recovery neuromuscular block reverse neuromuscular block . Org 25969 show previous trial greatly reduce time full recovery administer reappearance T2 , rocuronium- vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade . The current trial 19.4.208A conduct Japan set establish dose-response relationship Org 25969 give sevoflurane anesthesia reappearance T2 rocuronium vecuronium Japanese subject . In addition recovery time , also pharmacokinetics safety Org 25969 evaluate .</detailed_description>
