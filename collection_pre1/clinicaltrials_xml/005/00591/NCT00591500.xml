	<brief_summary>The goal study find people likely get melanoma , form skin cancer , others . To compare people one melanoma people one melanoma people similar develop melanoma . People respond environment different way . Some may bear gene make likely get type skin cancer . Each person many way repair normal damage gene . Specific gene may affect repair sun damage . Other gene affect way skin reacts sun . We want find gene normal change lead different response exposure , sun . We also want find sun habit relate way gene work .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Model Genetic Susceptibility : Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study well understand genetic susceptibility melanoma interaction specific polymorphisms environmental factor . To accomplish , buccal swab blood specimens patient melanoma ( either single primary multiple primary ) collect . Specimens prepared Epidemiology Laboratory MSKCC . They analyze MSKCC INK4A ( functional assay DNA repair capacity blood available ) melanocortin gene ( MC1R ) , University North Carolina polymorphism DNA repair gene immune function gene , University Pennsylvania polymorphisms melanocortin receptor gene ( MC1R ) immune function gene , University California ( Irvine ) polymorphisms metabolize gene ( P450 's GST 's ) . Samples bank MSKCC University New Mexico . In order perform study , subject population-based registry United States ( New Jersey , North Carolina , Michigan , San Diego/Imperial Counties ) , Canada ( Cancer Care Ontario , British Columbia ) , Italy ( Turin ) , Australia ( New South Wales , Tasmania ) , interview , ask provide blood buccal swab sample ask provide permission obtain review slide primary melanoma . This study close accrual .</detailed_description>
