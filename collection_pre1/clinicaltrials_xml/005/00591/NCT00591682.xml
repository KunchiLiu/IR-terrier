To characterize dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) determine overall safety tolerability MSX-122 Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics orally administer MSX-122 2 . To evaluate preliminary evidence anti-tumor activity MSX-122 3 . To perform correlative study elucidate signal pathway involve CXCR4 activation blood optional tissue specimen IHC ( immunohistochemistry ) RPPA ( reverse phase protein microarrays )</brief_summary>
