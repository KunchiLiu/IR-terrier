	<brief_summary>Decreased range motion common fracture around knee impact patient 's ability perform activity daily live rise seat position get bathtub . A continuous passive motion ( CPM ) machine machine continuously move joint ( knee ) without patient use muscle his/her leg . A goal therapy maintain much motion possible following injury . This study randomize , prospective study evaluate effectiveness CPM maintain knee range motion follow open reduction internal fixation ( ORIF ) fracture around knee</brief_summary>

	<criteria>If patient intraarticular distal femur proximal tibia fracture Independent ambulatory prior injury No previous knee injury limit motion If patient range motion decrease prior injury ( ex . Osteoarthritis , previous knee fracture injury ) Any contraindication CPM ( concomitant hip ankle fracture ) Open physis tibia distal femur Pathological Fracture Compartment Syndrome Neurovascular injury Fracture due gunshot wind Greater 21 day fracture definitive open reduction internal fixation Fractures treat definitive external fixation Open fracture Extensor mechanism injury Likely problem judgment investigator maintain followup</criteria>
