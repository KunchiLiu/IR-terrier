	<detailed_description>Background Significance : The development porcelain crown predictable restoration teeth bring development bond technique enamel dentin use multi-step total etch adhesive system along evolution small particle hybrid resin composite adhesive luting agent . One common post-operative concern patient follow delivery full coverage crown bridge sensitivity thermal condition mouth ( cold water , ice cream , etc . ) ( Goodacre , Bernal et al . 2003 ) . In order understand biological basis material important understand anatomy neurophysiology dentin . The following adapted paper provide Dr. Charles Cox ( Professor , University Alabama School Dentistry ) concern dentin structure mechanism reduction dentin hypersensitivity . Dentin vital tissue , hard bone weak enamel physiological elasticity prevent tooth fracture . Dentin approx . 74 % mineral ; organic phase approx . 26 % type-1 collagen small amount proteins water . The collagen matrix secrete biologically `` plastic '' material , harden variety mechanism . Normal dentin compose million tubule canal , run pulpal wall Dentin-Enamel Junction ( DEJ ) . The dimension tubules canal varies depend position within dentin structure . For instance , tubule diameter DEJ 0.06 µm , 3.0 µm pulpal wall ( approx . 60,000 tubule / mm2 ) . Most tubule fill fluid , odontoblast cell process , collagen , occasional non-myelinated pulpal nerve course approx . 150 µm towards DEJ ( Ten Cate 1998 ) . In normal ( non-anesthetized ) patient , Gysi ( 1900 ) report fluid distortion cavity floor cause sharp pain . Brännström et al . ( 1966 , 1969 , 1976 , 1979 , 1980 , 1996 ) demonstrate dentin hypersensitivity ( sharp pain ) result rapid fluid movement tubule complex , aggravate aggressive air-drying . Physiological test various animal study ( Heyeraas 1985 , Narhi 1983 , 1985 ) confirm fluid pulse hydrodynamic mechanism ( Brännström 1966 ) prime cause sudden dentin pain . Physiologically , rapid bi-directional fluid flow result sudden shift tubule fluid stimulus ( i.e . cold rapid airflow ; Brännström 1996 ) . Management dentin hypersensitivity one part successful dental complete coverage restoration ( dental crown bridge ) . In evaluate clinical service-life porcelain crown three aspect bond environment need consider . These consist tooth preparation , adhesive tooth crown preparation fit porcelain restoration tooth preparation . All ceramic restoration need enamel dentin reduction least 1.5 mm along smooth shoulder avoidance sharp edge avoid crack formation intaglio surface , proper esthetic , physiological contour strength final restoration . ( Goodacre , Campagni et al . 2001 ) Dental preparation full coverage restoration ( 1.5 2 mm clearance often mean 1.5 - 2 mm loss tooth structure ) inherently non-conservative reduced amount remain tooth structure elevate risk post-operative sensitivity . In today 's society , dental restoration provide minimal post-operative sensitivity part demand patient . There increase expectation esthetic , `` life-like '' restoration simulate replicate natural tooth . This complicate especially patient heavy occlusion miss teeth . The development CAD/CAM milling technology lay groundwork use high strength heat-pressed zirconia [ tetragonal zirconia polycrystals ( TZP ) yttrium partially stabilized polycrystal structure ] support framework support esthetic , `` life-like '' Lucite-base veneer ceramic material provide ceramic form full coverage dental restoration individual teeth replacement single miss tooth 3-united fix partial denture ( `` dental bridge '' ) . The use press porcelain crown technology allow improvement fit refractory die porcelain crown fabrication relative conventional Pt foil technique may lead great predictability reduce microleakage ( enhance service life dental restoration ) . The potential enhanced service life may depend combination silination bifunctional bis-GMA primer dual cure composite resin luting agent may seal microcracks within intaglio surface porcelain sufficient bond tooth structure reasonable service life .</detailed_description>
