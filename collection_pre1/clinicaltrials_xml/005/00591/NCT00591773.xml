	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Azilsartan Medoxomil Co-Administered With Chlorthalidone Participants With Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension affect approximately 50 million individual United States . As population age , prevalence hypertension continue increase broad effective preventive measure implement . According World Health Organization , hypertension common attributable cause preventable death develop nation , uncontrolled hypertension greatly increase risk cardiovascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , renal failure . Despite availability antihypertensive treatment , hypertension remain inadequately control ; one-third patient continue maintain control successfully . TAK-491 ( azilsartan medoxomil ) angiotensin II receptor blocker show orally active antihypertensive agent prolong duration activity good safety tolerability recent clinical study . Chlorthalidone thiazide-like diuretic reduces blood pressure decrease intravascular volume urinary salt water excretion . By combine action azilsartan medoxomil , great reduction blood pressure expect either agent alone . For subject require combination therapy , azilsartan medoxomil plus chlorthalidone offer novel combination may provide potent safe combination blood pressure reduction . This study conduct determine whether administration azilsartan medoxomil combination chlorthalidone subject uncontrolled hypertension effective reduce blood pressure chlorthalidone alone . This study also conduct evaluate safety tolerability azilsartan medoxomil combine chlorthalidone . Individuals want participate study require provide write informed consent . Study participation anticipate 10 Weeks . Multiple procedures occur visit may include fasting , blood collection , urine collection , vital sign include sit stand blood pressure pulse , body height weight , physical examination , electrocardiogram . Outside study center , participant require wear ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device 24 hour interval .</detailed_description>
