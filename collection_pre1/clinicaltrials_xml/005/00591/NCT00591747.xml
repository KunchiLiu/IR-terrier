Due combine effect breast cancer , related treatment age likely exercise even beneficial old breast cancer survivor young survivor . Along cancer-related symptom fatigue common cancer survivor , old survivor face age-related decline bone muscle mass , muscle strength , bone health physical function ( gait balance ) likely exacerbate reduced physical activity survivorship side effect adjuvant cancer treatment . All woman , regardless age , risk breast cancer recurrence . Recent epidemiologic evidence suggest link exercise reduce risk cancer recurrence breast cancer survivor . Strength train specifically suit reverse slow age-related decline bone , muscle , strength function show promise reduce cancer-related fatigue .
