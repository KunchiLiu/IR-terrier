	<brief_summary>Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) common chronic inflammatory disorder , noninvasive method assess disease location , severity , extent currently available . Recently publish animal data suggest use transabdominal ultrasound enhance encapsulate gaseous microbubbles may provide reliable , noninvasive mean detect quantify area intestinal inflammation . This study evaluate role Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography ( CEU ) use diagnostic tool patient IBD . We hypothesize severity extent chronic intestinal inflammation , quantify CEU-derived video intensity score , correlate endoscopically-derived measure intestinal inflammation obtain Crohn 's Disease Endoscopic Inflammatory Index ( CDEIS ) . A total 40 patient enrol study , 30 patient IBD 10 patient undergoing colonoscopy reason . Prior colonoscopy CEU assessment small large intestine perform evaluate neoangiogenesis intestinal blood flow . The correlation CEU-derived video intensity score CDEIS assess use Pearson 's correlation coefficient . Subjects may also undergo score use Rutgeerts Score , endoscopic disease assessment index use score disease activity patient previous ileocolonic resection . Comparing video intensity IBD non-IBD subject perform use Wilcoxon rank sum test , secondary aim establish preliminary estimate sensitivity microbubble scoring system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-invasive Imaging GI Inflammation Using Microbubble Contrast Enhanced Ultrasonography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GI inflammation may indicate number complication disease , one inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , second prevalent inflammatory disorder world . Symptoms disease include severe abdominal pain , bloody diarrhea , persistent fever , weight loss , significant malnutrition . There also increase risk colon cancer . If leave untreated , disease debilitating . Prompt intervention may reduce amount immunosuppressive therapy require control disease , time patient becomes symptomatic , inflammatory response difficult suppress much damage already do . It therefore important closely monitor patient IBD . The location , extent , severity inflammation primary consideration correct diagnosis treatment . However , inexpensive non-invasive procedure exist protocol assessment factor IBD . A non-invasive diagnostic detect onset inflammation measure extent inflammatory involvement would valuable tool evaluation patient IBD . Endoscopy , barium contrast X-ray study , compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , transabdominal ultrasound ( US ) currently common procedure use gastroenterologist . The preferred manner investigate GI inflammation include endoscopy biopsy , endoscopy confirm presence inflammation . However , procedure highly invasive limited area accessible endoscope . There also limit real risk associate endoscopy . In addition , cost procedure may prohibitive , qualified professional inaccessible , patient . Barium contrast X-ray study remain best way visualize stricture fistulae small intestine , provide insight degree extent active inflammation . Repeated X-rays chronic young patient also contribute risk irradiation . CT MRI gold-standard image extra-intestinal inflammatory disease , fail ability identify active inflammation . There recently many study attempt improve mean assess GI inflammation . Transabdominal US present non-invasive mean image internal organ imposes significant health risk undue discomfort upon patient . The use abdominal US evaluation IBD implement early 1979 , wall thicken terminal ileum cecum , accompany inflammatory change mesentery , yield recognizable pattern longitudinal transverse images.11 These initial ultrasonographic image lack sufficient resolution provide sensitive measure disease activity , technological advance high frequency US greatly improve resolution past twenty year . Still , location chronicity certain condition may decrease efficacy image technique , make endoscopy preferred method investigation GI problem . At present , several research group actively investigate application US management IBD . The combined result study , addition relatively wide availability , low cost , easy use US equipment , support rationale develop US useful tool evaluation IBD . Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography ( CEU ) main strategy improve US quality . One contrast agent study image inflammation , yet human-tested improvement US quality inflammation due IBD , microbubbles ( MB ) . MB contrast agent FDA-approved , become common clinical tool enhancement US image cardiovascular hemodynamics around world . Unlike tissue signal , produce US reflection , strong signal generate MB produce radial oscillation MB acoustic field . Current MB use perfusion image lipid albumin shell contain high-molecular weight gas ( perfluorocarbon , sulfur hexafluoride ) , contribute high intravascular stability prevent outward diffusion gas . MB generally 2-4µm size - small average capillary dimension - pass unimpeded microcirculation . They also hemodynamically inert , behave similar red blood cell vivo . In animal model acoustic property activate Definity® ( Perflutren Lipid Microsphere ) injectable suspension , establish mechanical index 0.7 ( 1.8 MHz frequency ) . In clinical trial , majority patient image mechanical index .08 . There two way microbubbles might contribute strong signal area inflammation small intestine colon . The first directly neoangiogenesis increase blood flow site . Defined growth new blood vessel , neoangiogenesis important pathogenesis Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis . An expanded microvascular bed mucosa submucosa IBD patient active inflammation confirm , consistent high level integrins characteristic proliferate endothelium ( e.g . IL-8 , bFGF , VEGF ) find microvessels tissue affect IBD . The hope increase blood flow actively inflame IBD correlate strong US signal increase concentration MB flow site . The second way microbubble CEU may effective identify active inflammation indirect effect new microvasculature . Neoangiogenesis think contribute pathogenesis foster recruitment activation increase number leukocyte inflame mucosa . It observe albumin lipid shell MB use echocardiographic study phagocytosed intact activate leukocyte , adherent inflame endothelium small intestine colon . These phagocytosed MB retain percentage acoustic property , enable US image inflammation non-invasively vivo setting . Incorporation specific lipid moiety microbubble shell increase retention phagocytosis activate leukocyte . An investigation efficacy microbubble contrast agent image GI inflammation first step towards target image tissue-targeted therapy .</detailed_description>
