	<brief_summary>In effort elucidate whether Harmonic Scalpel improve seal lymphatics decrease lymphatic drainage thereby decrease length time chest tube require minimize length stay ; Harmonic Scalpel compare control group use electrocautery . This study assess two different method determine notable decrease amount drainage one versus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Harmonic Scalpel Decrease Lymphatic Chest Tube Drainage After Lymph Node Dissection With Lobectomy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lymph node dissection integral part surgical management lung cancer . Knowledge lymph node status play key role therapeutic decision make prognosis . Associated dissection come propensity lymphatic leakage , increase chest tube drainage , prolonged retention chest tubes postoperative period increase patient length stay . Our center perform complete mediastinal node dissection relevant regional lymph node generally include paratracheal , pretracheal , subcarinal , hilar paraesophageal node . The current standard practice dissection lymph node include use Harmonic Scalpel electrocautery . Known risk electrocautery include localize nerve damage , cardiac arrhythmia damage tissue sample/specimen use pathology . The Harmonic Scalpel technology recently become available use . Current experience Harmonic Scalpel suggest less localized nerve damage , less incidence arrhythmia , less damage tissue sample less lymph leakage . There publish data support hypothesis , thus purpose study .</detailed_description>
