	<brief_summary>The purpose study verify whether stent position malignant obstruction colon rectum follow elective surgery allow reduction postoperative complication hospital stay without worsen evolution neoplastic illness , compare emergency surgery . Primary endpoint 60 day postoperative morbidity . Others endpoint postoperative mortality , length hospital stay , need analgesia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction &amp; background In emergency surgery , although surgical resuscitation technique improve , postoperative complication mortality rate still high however high patient underwent elective surgery ( 1-3 ) . Using Metallic prosthesis stent obstruct colon allows transform emergency surgical case elective surgery case . This allow restore bowel transit operate elective condition reduce morbidity , mortality need enterostomy ( 4-10 ) . Although recent outcome literature use decompressive stent surgery obstruct patient malignant colic tumour , prospective randomise study stent position follow elective surgery compare emergency surgery . Study design Prospective , randomize multicentric clinical trial sample patient emergency room diagnosis obstruct colonic neoplasm . Once inform obtain consent , patient include study randomize one two branch study : A.- enteral stent position follow second time resection hospital stay . B.- emergency surgical treatment consist Hartmann operation resection time anastomosis . Results transit reconstruction patient underwent Hartmann operation consider study . Short term clinical evolution control order determine postoperative morbility mortality , hospital stay . Follow-up perform evaluate survival rate disease free survival . Endpoints To evaluate compare result obtain use enteral stent follow elective surgery versus common emergency surgical technique . Primary endpoint 60 day postoperative morbidity . Others endpoint : postoperative mortality , length hospital stay , need analgesia . Long term follow specific instrumental control ( CT scan , US , colonoscopy RX clysma ) identify disease recurrence metastases cost analysis patient 's quality life also evaluate . Statistics &amp; randomization In prospective series analyse different centre , incidence postoperative complication patient underwent emergency colonic surgery 35 % . The position stent associate second time surgical elective treatment characterize 15 % morbidity ( stent : 5 % , surgery : 10 % ) . The number patient need carry study make statistically significant difference ( 35 % vs 15 % ) error alpha = 0.05 beta = 0.2 estimate loss 5 % sample , 72 patient group . Randomization stratify local extension tumour ( T4 v others ) presence liver metastasis . Main selection criterion Inclusion patient malignant colonic obstruction localize promontorium splenic flexure diagnose CTScan . Those patient peritonitis , pneumoperitoneum , synchronic colonic tumour , pregnant haemodynamic instability exclude . Follow-up Same follow-up patient diagnose treated Colon Cancer follow protocol center , never less 3 year . During follow-up require complementary study perform case order evaluate local recurrence distant metastasis . Also quality life cost evaluate . Expected result : reduction postoperative complication hospital stay patient submit stent position without worsen evolution neoplastic illness .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>malignant colonic obstruction localize splenic flexure 15 cm anal margin diagnose CTScan . Possibility endoscopy stent location next 24 h diagnostic . Clinical occlusion gas faeces . Informed consent obtain patient relative case inability . Bowel perforation diagnose clinical exploration complementary study . Associated pathology contraindicate general anaesthesia and/or haemodynamic instability . Impossibility gain valid inform consent refusal patient . Patients multiple liver metastasis diagnose CTScan moment diagnostic consider operable curative intention follow standard every center .</criteria>
