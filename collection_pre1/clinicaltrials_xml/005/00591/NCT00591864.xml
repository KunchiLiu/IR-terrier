	<brief_title>Comparison MRI Molecular Breast Imaging Breast Diagnostic Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Breast MRI excellent sensitivity , expensive suffers low specificity . Additional benign biopsy prompt MRI 24-40 % patient . Molecular Breast Imaging ( MBI ) new nuclear medicine technique develop Mayo . Preliminary MBI result indicate sensitivity ~88 % detection tumor &lt; 10 mm . The cost MBI procedure expect factor 5 less MRI examination . Hypothesis : MBI comparable sensitivity MRI significantly low cost . Study Design : A total 120 patient study . All patient schedule bilateral breast MRI Mayo Clinic Rochester clinical concern , problem solving , abnormal mammogram and/or ultrasound study . All patient undergo MBI within 3 week MRI examination . Potential Outcomes : This study provide valuable information sensitivity MBI relative MRI , determine new technique eventually develop alternative MRI problem solving .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>This study include population woman age 25 old schedule breast MRI examination MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER . Patients must lactate pregnant . All woman childbearing potential must negative urine pregnancy test result within 2 day prior MBI study . woman schedule breast MRI examination clinical concern , problem solve evaluation invasive breast cancer ( e.g . preoperative stag know breast cancer ) . They unable understand sign consent form They pregnant lactate They physically unable sit upright still 40 minute . The breast MRI screening purpose determine status breast augmentation . They undergo breast surgery within previous year</criteria>
