	<detailed_description>Some research show survivor adult head neck cancer , receive radiation therapy , increase risk thicken blockage carotid artery , may increase risk medical condition , stroke . Researchers want learn possible risk thicken blockage carotid artery survivor childhood head neck cancer . If agree take part study , researcher see possible effect ( thicken blockage ) radiation therapy carotid artery . This do examine test result routine testing ( mention ) normally do standard long-term follow-up care disease . These routine test would perform even research study . During long-term follow-up clinic appointment , physical exam ultrasound test ( perform Cardiology Clinic ) carotid artery . A carotid ultrasound test use sound wave look blood vessel neck . Blood drawn ( 2-3 teaspoon ) laboratory test , include blood sugar level , blood cholesterol level , blood triglyceride level , thyroid hormone level , blood level certain protein ( C-reactive protein brain natriuretic peptide ) . If test show thickening blockage carotid arteries medical problem , high blood sugar , study doctor discuss test result , treatment option , and/or follow-up plan . This investigational study . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
