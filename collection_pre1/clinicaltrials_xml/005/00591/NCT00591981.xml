	<brief_title>Thoracic OncoGeriatric Assessment ( TOGA ) Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our propose TOGA wil consist portion PACE additional screening tool , apply prospectively patient 70 year old see UWCCC thoracic oncology surgery . Residents nurse home assist live facility eligible study think appropriate surgical candidate ; institutionalize patient . The preoperative TOGA perform either Drs . Weigel , Maloney , LoConte Traynor P.A . Block . The TOGA include part PACE , involve assessment co-morbid illness , Activities Daily Living [ ADL ] , Instrumental Activities Daily Living [ IADL ] , Geriatric Depression Screen [ GDS ] , Brief Fatigue Inventory [ BFI ] , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group/Zubrod Performance Status [ PS ] , Mini Mental State Exam ( MMSE ) , addition American Society Anesthesiologists Score [ ASA ] mini nutritional assessment ( MNA ) , do PACE . The TOGA take 25 minute complete ( Audisio , 2006 ) , do one time preoperativelOur hypothesis novel , preoperative Thoracic Onco Geriatric Assessment ( TOGA ) serve predict outcome old patient go though thoracic oncology surgery , thus enhance geriatric patient care development concise , validate , preoperative risk stratification . Our hypothesis abbreviate geriatric screen tool well predictor surgical oncologic complication surgery performance status alone ( currently measure fitness use routine oncology care ) . In addition , predict part TOGA , specifically instrumental activites daily live score ( IADL ) , mini nutritional assessment ( MNA ) brief fatigue inventory ( BFI ) , strong predictor ( ) outcomes thoracic surgery population . The outcome data generate also important quality improvement standardization preoperative risk assessment elderly patient thoracic malignancy .</detailed_description>
