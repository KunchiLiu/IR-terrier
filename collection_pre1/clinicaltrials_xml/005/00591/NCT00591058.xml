	<brief_title>Safety Dose-Finding Study TM-601 Adults With Recurrent Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I study evaluate safety TM-601 patient recurrent malignant glioma fail first-line , standard therapy . Study patient assign receive treatment 1 6 treatment cohort . Patients assign dose level group 3-6 ( depend upon treatment response see within cohort ) , escalation next high dose dependent upon demonstrate tolerance previous dose group . Patients administer image dose 131I-TM-601 , intravenously , demonstrate tumor-specific localization prior study treatment non-labeled TM-601 . Eligible patient demonstrate tumor-specific imaging assign treatment cohort receive non-labeled TM-601 week 3 week , follow clinical follow-up visit MR imaging . Data study help determine IV dose TM-601 require produce MR perfusion change ( well biomarker change ) patient recurrent malignant glioma . It know whether participation trial provide patient benefit term improve tumor control , although pre-clinical evidence evidence clinical trial 131I TM-601 suggest TM-601 active agent malignant glioma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients Must : 1 . Have histologically prove malignant glioma ( anaplastic astrocytoma , anaplastic oligodendroglioma glioblastoma multiforme ) progressive recurrent external beam radiation therapy ( least 50 Gy ) ± chemotherapy . Patients previous low grade glioma progress radiotherapy ± chemotherapy biopsied find high grade glioma eligible . 2 . Be ≥18 year age . 3 . Have baseline Karnofsky Performance status ≥60 % 4 . Have Mini Mental State Exam score ≥ 19 . 5 . Have life expectancy , base Investigator 's judgment , &gt; 3 month . 6 . On screen ECG , QTc interval &lt; 450 ms. 7 . If taking steroid , dose stable least 5 day prior image dose . 8 . Have recover toxicity previous therapy prior enrollment . If patient undergone recent major surgery , interval least 3 week must elapse surgery date image dose . 9 . Have adequate organ marrow function define : hemoglobin &gt; 9.0g/dL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500 mm3 platelet count &gt; 100,000 mm3 prothrombin time &lt; 1.5 ULN partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) &lt; 1.5 ULN total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 5 x institutional ULN creatinine ( serum ) ≤2.0 mg/dL* *If serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 creatinine clearance must ≥60 ml/min 10 . Have negative serum urine pregnancy test within 14 day study drug administration , female child bear potential . 11 . Agree use effective form contraception avoid pregnancy , fertile ( applicable male female patient ) . 12 . Agree refrain nursing , female . 13 . Have sign date write informed consent . 14 . Be able comply treatment plan , study procedure followup examination . Patients may NOT : 1 . Have serious concurrent infection medical illness would jeopardize ability patient receive treatment outline protocol reasonable safety . ( Examples medical illness [ limit ] following : uncontrolled hypertension , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . ) 2 . Have prior malignancy le 5year disease free interval , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ cancer cervix . 3 . Be pregnant breastfeeding . 4 . Have receive radiation treatment ≤ 3 month time first study drug administration . 5 . Have receive cytotoxic chemotherapy , whether conventional investigational , ≤ 4 week prior enrollment study ( 6 week mitomycinC nitrosoureas ) . 6 . Have history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition 131ITM601 e.g . iodine iodinecontaining drug .</criteria>
