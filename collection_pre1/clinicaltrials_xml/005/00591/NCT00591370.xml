	<brief_summary>Temozolomide ( also know TMZ ) chemotherapy drug give mouth . It similar DTIC , FDA-approved chemotherapy melanoma , temozolomide give mouth , give daily long period time . We think temozolomidemay work best give every day 6 week time . Temozolomide give extended schedule experimental , although find safe shrink melanoma patient . One big advantage TMZ give mouth instead vein . This mean give daily long period time rather like DTIC . We think TMZ may work good give every day 6 week . TMZ give extend schedule experimental although found TMZ give way safe shrink melanoma patient . When extended dosing TMZ give either thalidomide long-acting interferon-α , 30 % patient tumor shrink . We think shrinkage due mostly TMZ since neither thalidomide interferon-α alpha work melanoma . In study , treat patient TMZ alone use extend dosing schedule see many patient experience tumor shrinkage . We also want learn tumor likely shrink TMZ treatment . We test sample tumor whether gene call MGMT turn ,</brief_summary>
