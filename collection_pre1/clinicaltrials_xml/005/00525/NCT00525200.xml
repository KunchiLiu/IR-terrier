	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis : PANCHO prospective randomize , predictive marker study , evaluate interaction potential predictive marker 'p53 genotype ' response induction chemotherapy patient esophageal cancer consider resectable . 170 patient measurable disease enrol study . After test marker genotype ( two genotype : p53 normal p53 mutant ) patient stratify accord histological subtype ( adeno- squamous cell carcinoma ) randomly assign receive 3 cycle either 5-fluorouracil ( 5FU ) /cisplatin docetaxel monotherapy neoadjuvant therapy . All patient render subsequent surgery order ass clinical pathohistological response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PANCHO test hypothesis p53 genotype predictive response chemotherapy . The study use marker treatment interaction design . In design , assume status marker split whole population two distinct group ( p53 normal versus p53 mutant ) . Patients marker group randomly assign two different treatment , plan statistical analysis test whether one treatment superior within marker group separately . The marker information treatment blind patient investigator .</detailed_description>
