	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination investigational drug oxaliplatin 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) ( give time radiation therapy ) effective combination two drug give radiation therapy treatment esophageal gastroesophageal cancer . The safety combination therapy also compare . Objectives : Primary objective : Compare Pathologic Complete Response rate % patient &lt; 50 % residual cancer resect surgical specimen Arms A B . Secondary objective : 1 . Compare 1-year 3-year survival rate , median survival time , R0 resection rate , safety , local plus systemic relapse rate Arms A B 2 . Perform exploratory correlative study blood , adjacent normal cancer tissue assess predictive marker response outcome . 3 . Evaluate joint effect , include possible interactive effect , proton-versus-photon therapy treatment arm overall survival , R0 resection rate , safety , local plus systemic relapse rate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oxaliplatin 5-FU chemotherapy drug commonly use treat certain kind cancer . 5-FU design prevent cell make DNA necessary cell growth . This disrupt growth cancer cell , cause cancer cell start die . Oxaliplatin design damage DNA already form . If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two group . Participants first group ( Arm A ) receive chemotherapy radiation treatment . Participants second group ( Arm B ) receive chemotherapy first chemotherapy radiation treatment . The chemotherapy use study include 5-FU oxaliplatin . Arm B 8 week longer Arm A . Your doctor discus whether receive proton photon radiation . If receive proton radiation , give build 5 minute drive main MD Anderson radiation clinic . All participant routine upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy biopsy endoscopic ultrasound examination receive treatment study . However , start study , upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy repeat 2nd cycle induction chemotherapy Arm B ( need ) , chemoradiation , surgery . This procedure involve examination esophagus , stomach , duodenum flexible tube . Biopsies take necessary . Arm A : If assign Arm A , receive treatment 5-FU 24 hour 5 day week 5 week . It give infusion vein use portable pump . This start Day 1 ( Monday ) continue Day 5 ( Friday ) radiotherapy week 5 week . You need carry pump 96 hour . The pump size personal compact disc player . You also receive oxaliplatin infusion vein 2 hour Day 1 . This repeat Days 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 . During time receive radiation therapy every weekday 5 week . If cancer get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study doctor discus treatment option . Each week receive chemoradiotherapy , around 1 tablespoon blood drawn routine test . Between 5-6 week completion chemoradiotherapy , stage cancer evaluate . This include draw blood ( 1 tablespoon ) routine test , Electrocardiography ( ECG ) , Physical Fitness Testing ( PFT ) , compute tomography ( CT ) abdomen chest ( necessary ) , Positron emission tomography ( PET ) PET/CT scan , upper GI endoscopy biopsy check status abdominal disease ( necessary ) . When evaluation status disease complete , surgical removal primary tumor lymph node attempt . All participant spread disease , physically able surgery disease judge removable eligible surgery . The tube ( J-tube ) leave body least 8 week surgery supplement nutrition . Arm B : If assign Arm B , receive start ( induction ) course chemotherapy radiation therapy ever start . You receive 5-FU 48 hour infusion vein use portable pump . This start Day 1 continue 48 hour . This repeat Day 15 another 48 hour . You need carry pump time Days 1-2 Days 15-16 . The pump size personal compact disc player . You also receive oxaliplatin infusion vein 2 hour Days 1 15 . One cycle equal 28 day , include 2 dos 5-FU oxaliplatin give Day 1 Day 15 . Treatment always follow 12 day recovery . You receive maximum 2 cycle ( 4 dos 5-FU oxaliplatin ) . After first second cycle , give full physical exam , upper GI x-rays necessary , 1 tablespoon blood drawn routine blood test , need , CT scan abdomen chest perform . You PET scan PET CT scan upper GI endoscopy biopsy ( need ) start Cycle 2 end Cycle 2 . If disease gotten bad 1st cycle induction chemotherapy , receive 2nd cycle . An upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy biopsy perform . If disease get bad stage , go straight chemoradiotherapy . If disease start spread , take study doctor discus treatment option . You begin receive chemoradiotherapy 12 day complete last dose induction chemotherapy . You receive treatment 5-FU 24 hour 5 day week 5 week . It give infusion vein use portable pump . This start Day 1 ( Monday ) continue Day 5 ( Friday ) radiotherapy week 5 week . You need carry pump time 96 hour . You also receive oxaliplatin infusion vein 2 hour Day 1 . This repeat Days 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 . During time receive radiation therapy every weekday 5 week . If cancer get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study doctor discus treatment option . Each week receive chemoradiotherapy , around 1 tablespoon blood drawn routine test . Between 5-6 week completion chemoradiotherapy , stage cancer evaluate . This include draw blood ( 1 tablespoon ) routine test , ECG , PFT , CT abdomen chest ( necessary ) , PET Scan PET CT Scan , upper GI endoscopy biopsy check status abdominal disease ( necessary ) . When evaluation status disease complete , surgical removal primary tumor lymph node attempt . All participant spread disease , physically able surgery disease judge removable eligible surgery . The tube ( J-tube ) leave body least 8 week surgery supplement nutrition . Arms A B : You ask fill side effect sheet throughout participation research study . You ask question regard nausea , hair loss , fatigue , meal , question regard daily activity . You ask keep daily calendar receive therapy type . You ask come follow-up visit MD Anderson 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month surgery every 6 month 2 year , year 2 year . At visit , full physical exam , 1 tablespoon blood drawn routine test CEA test ( carcinoembryonic antigen - protein make cancer normal cell ) CEA level high past . You also PET scan , PET CT scan , CT chest abdomen . You upper GI endoscopy biopsy 3 month surgery follow-up visit need . You may CT chest abdomen 3 month visit need . This investigational study . Oxaliplatin investigational drug approve US use treatment esophageal gastroesophageal cancer . The combination 2 drug ( oxaliplatin + 5-FU ) investigational . All procedure standard care . A total 126 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
