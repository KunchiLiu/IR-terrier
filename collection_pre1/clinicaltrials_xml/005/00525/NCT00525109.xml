	<brief_title>Elevated Serum HDL Four Generations Nashville Family</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HDL , good cholesterol , show protect heart attack stroke . How HDL work protective agent well understood . There family 4 generation live member high HDL level . In study , consent obtain , obtain 2 tablespoon blood family member order study cholesterol level obtain DNA order determine pattern inheritance trait . We also fill questionnaire medical history , diet activity level affect HDL level . In addition obtain additional blood ( 2 tablespoon ) plasma , white blood cell also perform biopsy obtain skin cell match pair family member without trait order determine gene might turn trait . We also wish study family member high HDL cholesterol well . These individual identify core database .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>26 live member family HDL level great 90mg/dl several act relate age match control . The investigator also identify individual lipid core database HDL 's great 90mg/dl normal low LDL triglyceride level determine normal low LDL triglyceride level determine family member ( parent sibling ) also high HDL cholesterol . Individuals member study family individual high HDL 's elevated LDL and/or triglyceride .</criteria>
