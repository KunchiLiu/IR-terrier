	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Etoricoxib Acute Ankle Sprain : A Double-Blind Comparative Study Among 2 Treatments Protocols</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives Primary - To compare efficacy 2 treatment dos patient acute ankle sprain sport Secondary - To compare overall safety tolerability etoricoxib 60 mg 90mg patient acute ankle sprain sport Hypothesis - The efficacy etoricoxib 60 mg daily non-inferior etoricoxib 90mg daily 14 day treatment acute ankle sprain sport . - The 60 mg dose etoricoxib similarity reduce pain effective decreasing degree edema , patient experience remission , allow resumption regular sporting activity end entire treatment . - Both dos generally well tolerated gastrointestinal intolerance see . Background Significance Selected Topic Etoricoxib cyclo-oxygenase ( COX ) -2-selective NSAID high COX-1 COX-2 selectivity ratio COX-2-selective NSAIDs rofecoxib , valdecoxib celecoxib . In patient rheumatoid arthritis , improvement tender swell joint count patient investigator global assessment disease activity significantly great etoricoxib placebo recipient two study . Etoricoxib also significantly effective naproxen one study . In patient osteoarthritis hip knee , etoricoxib significantly effective placebo similar efficacy naproxen regard improvement pain physical function score patient global assessment disease status score two study . Etoricoxib similar efficacy diclofenac patient osteoarthritis knee . Single-dose etoricoxib relieve pain patient postoperative dental pain two study . Similar score assess total pain relief 8 hour ( TOPAR8 ) report etoricoxib naproxen sodium ibuprofen recipient , high TOPAR8 score report etoricoxib paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) /codeine . Pain relief significantly well etoricoxib placebo two study patient chronic low back pain . Etoricoxib similar efficacy indomethacin study patient acute gout , single-dose etoricoxib similar efficacy naproxen sodium study woman primary dysmenorrhoea . Compared non-COX-selective NSAIDs , etoricoxib associate significantly few upper gastrointestinal ( GI ) perforation , ulcer bleeds , significantly less likely result treatment discontinuation NSAID-type GI symptom GI symptom . There significant number study show efficacy superior GI tolerability profile etoricoxib chronic pathology mention . However among acute pain pathology number specific diagnosis may better explore . A common diagnosis cause acute pain traumatic sport-related lesion soft tissue ( sprain , tendinitis , bursitis ) . One common diagnosis acute ankle sprain , many patient acute injury use medication control pain decrease amount edema . Etoricoxib approve acute pain dosage 90 mg routinely prescribe soft tissue inflammatory condition , acute gout . Otherway , clinical case lead long period pain , usually 2 week . As know , use medication one week decrease dosage , case use high dose lead persistent edema ankle joint . Therefore study compare etoricoxib 90 mg versus 60 mg acute ankle sprain sport-related lesion justify . As know today , effort focus usign small dose reach best clinical result specific medication . Study Design - Study Type This pilot study , randomize , single center , double-blind , parallel-group study compare efficacy tolerability etoricoxib 90 mg versus 60 mg patient acute ankle sprain . - Sample Size The study include 50 patient . One primary investigator ( Rogerio Teixeira da Silva , MD , PhD ) coordinate project . - Study Medication Flowchart A total 50 patient recruit randomized double-blind 14 day treatment study evaluate efficacy tolerability oral etoricoxib 90mg daily comparison etoricoxib 60 mg/day 1:1 proportion . • Study Procedures Visit 1 / day 0 Screening : IC , Incl/excl criterion , MH , VS , PE , local injury exam , Lab test : hemogram , biochemistry , , B-HCG ( woman ) , Hemoccult . Assessment pain pain mobilization VAS . Assessment pain motion resistance , functional impairment , measurement edema ( volumetric measurement ) / Ultrasound examination ankle Visit 2 / day 1 ( may allow perform visit 1 lab test available ) . Randomization : complying IC incl/excl criterion , 1 dose assist . PE , local injury exam . Assessment pain pain mobilization VAS . Assessment pain motion resistance , functional impairment . Visit 3 / day 8 Evaluation Adverse Experiences . VS , PE , local injury exam . Assessment pain pain mobilization VAS . Assessment pain motion resistance , functional impairment global assessment efficacy tolerability. , measurement edema ( volumetric measurement ) Visit 4 / day 15 End treatment . Evaluation Adverse Experiences , VS , PE , local injury exam , hemoccult . Lab test : hemogram , biochemistry , B-HCG ( woman ) , Hemoccult . Assessment pain pain mobilization VAS . Assessment pain motion resistance , functional impairment global assessment efficacy tolerability . measurement edema ( volumetric measurement ) Phone Contact / Day 45 After 4 week completion treatment , phone contact assess resumption regular sporting activity adverse experience period . Efficacy Measures / endpoint interest Primary • The main efficacy criterion reduction pain active mobilization measure use visual analogue scale VAS day 8 , . We measure normal movement joint ( flexion extension , abduction adduction , external internal rotation ) . Also evaluate volumetric measurement ankle foot , day 1 day 8 . Secondary - The secondary efficacy criterion pain motion resistance , functional impairment global assessment efficacy either patient investigator , measure Day 15 . It measure VAS also use volumetric measurement . - Tolerability assessed frequency adverse experience global assessment efficacy either patient investigator . Statistics In study include total 50 patient present acute ankle sprain occur sport , treat either oral etoricoxib ( 120 mg/day 60 mg/day ) 14 day , double-blind condition , verify efficacy safety post-treatment accordingly . Pain evaluation perform visual analog scale ( VAS ) , range 0 10 , median difference one point VAS consider significant . Based upon work use scale , verified standard deviation within VAS , average , 1.2 point . According methodology present Fisher &amp; Belle ( 1993 ) , follow table present sample estimation different significance study power : Confidence Power Number necessary per group ( ni ) 1-point difference VAS ( 1 − α ) ( 1 − β ) 0.95 0.95 37 0.95 0.90 30 0.95 0.80 23 0.90 0.95 31 0.90 0.90 25 0.90 0.80 18 Therefore , number patient study group would 25 patient , confidence interval 95 % study power 90 % . Considering study pilot , believe power good . After study , another one least 74 patient prove power .</detailed_description>
