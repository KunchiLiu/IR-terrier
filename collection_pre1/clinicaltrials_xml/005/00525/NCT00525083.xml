	<detailed_description>Clinical investigation show lower `` total serum cholesterol '' level result significant reduction coronary artery disease myocardial infarction . Thus , intervention low `` total serum cholesterol '' commonly employ medical professional - include behavioral modification ( exercise , dieting , weight loss ) pharmacological intervention . Investigation show clinical outcome rely `` total serum cholesterol '' . `` Total serum cholesterol '' comprise multiple subtypes - notable `` HDL Cholesterol '' `` LDL cholesterol '' . Analysis data show high level LDL cholesterol predict high rate cardiovascular event , high level HDL cholesterol actually predictive significantly less cardiovascular event . These effect independent cardiovascular risk factor . The mechanism LDL cholesterol result heart disease intensely investigate elucidate . Numerous drug approve utilized physician low LDL cholesterol patient prevent primary secondary cardiovascular disease . Epidemiological data show low level HDL-C place individual high risk coronary artery disease high level HDL-C actually decrease individual 's risk . The mechanism behind risk reduction remain unclear likely multi-factorial . Furthermore , data suggest HDL-C important risk reduction , necessarily measure serum level HDL-C , also composition , oxidation state , metabolism HDL-C determine individual 's cardiac risk . Understanding mechanism could lead potential therapeutic target well clinically relevant diagnostic testing .</detailed_description>
