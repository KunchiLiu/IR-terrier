	<brief_summary>1 . To determine safety efficacy non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation use rituximab , cyclophosphamide , fludarabine preparative regimen patient advance recurrent mantle cell lymphoma . 2 . To determine factor associate response durable remission patient receive rituximab , cyclophosphamide , fludarabine preparation allogeneic stem cell transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-Myeloablative Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MATCHED SIBLING TRANSPLANTS : If find eligible take part study , admit hospital receive treatment . Two ( 2 ) chemotherapy drug , fludarabine cyclophosphamide , give day 3 day . The drug give one time vein . Each treatment take 30 minute . Fludarabine give first , cyclophosphamide give 4 hour later . You receive rituximab week 4 week vein 4-8 hour . The first dose start one week start chemotherapy . Two day finish chemotherapy , receive transplant stem cell sibling . The stem cell infuse vein . Seven day later , begin receive drug call granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) . G-CSF help new stem cell normal work body ; make new blood cell . You receive G-CSF day blood cell count begin recover certain level . Sometimes donor cell cause inflammation skin , liver gut , reaction call graft-versus-host disease occur . The drug tacrolimus methotrexate give help decrease risk . These drug also give vein transplant . Tacrolimus infuse two day transplant continue give daily continuous infusion . Methotrexate give vein short infusion Days 1 , 3 , 6 transplant . Tacrolimus also come pill form , may switch pill ready . During hospitalization , examine daily , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) sample take daily evaluate blood count level , function liver kidney , well electrolytes . This blood also use measure tacrolimus level look infection . You might give blood transfusion blood cell count remain low . MATCHED UNRELATED OR MISMATCHED SIBLING TRANSPLANTS : Alemtuzumab drug design specifically attack type leukemia lymphoma cell . In addition , weaken immune system , help prevent rejection donor marrow stem cell . TBI design damage DNA ( genetic material cell ) cancer cell , may kill cancer cell . Cyclophosphamide design interfere multiplication cancer cell , may slow stop growth spread throughout body . This may cause cancer cell die . Fludarabine design make cancer cell less able repair damage DNA . This may increase likelihood cell die . Rituximab design attach lymphoma cell , may cause die . If find eligible take part study , admit hospital treatment . Alemtuzumab inject vein period 4 hour . This do 3 day row ( Days 1 3 ) . Drugs diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) , solumedrol acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) give decrease risk ease side effect dose alemtuzumab . You also receive fludarabine cyclophosphamide day 3 day . They give day alemtuzumab . Both drug give catheter ( plastic tube ) extend large chest vein . The catheter leave place throughout treatment study . Some participant , depend type disease , also receive rituximab . Rituximab give 8 day transplant week total 4 dos . After completion chemotherapy , receive TBI , later day , blood stem cell donor give catheter . G-CSF , growth factor promote production blood cell , injected skin day blood cell count recover certain level . Blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) , urine test , bone marrow aspiration , x-rays do need track effect transplant . The blood test draw daily hospital least twice weekly outpatient first 100 day . The CT scan bone marrow study do 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month every 6 month least 3 year transplant . You may also transfusions blood platelet need . IMMUNOMODULATION POST NONABLATIVE STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION FOR PATIENTS WITH LYMPHOID MALIGNANCIES : You receive treatment outpatient . You receive rituximab 4 - 8 hour vein week 4 week . You also get boost cell donor receive original transplant . These additional cell infuse vein ( 30 - 60 minute ) second third dose rituximab . The infusion may do later cell available schedule . Sometimes donor cell cause inflammation skin , liver gut , reaction call graft-versus-host disease occur . If happens , drug tacrolimus methotrexate give help control reaction . These medication usually give pill daily basis . A boost high number cell may infuse month 3 month graft-versus-host disease disease remain . During treatment , examine need , blood sample ( 1 tablespoon twice week ) take routine test . You may need receive blood transfusion study blood cell count remain low . About 40 patient take part study , enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
