	<brief_summary>Walnuts include many potentially beneficial micronutrient phytochemical , study propose examine effect walnuts independent macronutrient content . The purpose proposal study depth short-term effect walnut consumption men woman metabolic syndrome . Study Aim 1 : To investigate effect walnut ( 48gms per day 3 day ) insulin resistance subject metabolic syndrome . Study Aim 2 : To investigate effect 48gms per day walnuts 3 day lipids inflammatory marker . Study Aim 3 : To assess possible mechanism biological effect short-term walnut consumption assessment adipokines , rest metabolic rate , gene expression white blood cell effect walnut consume part mixed meal , glucose excursion , insulin secretion excretion gut peptide free fatty acid .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Metabolic Effects Short-term Walnut Consumption Subjects With Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During whole study period , ask maintain constant body weight receive advice dietitian regard weight stable diet exercise pattern . You also ask avoid walnut entire study period . The intervention measurement visit describe . If agree study , ask read sign consent form . After sign consent form , follow thing happen : 1 . Screening Procedures : Screening procedure test procedure do determine eligible take part research study . For research study , screen procedure include : 1 . A detailed medical history interview lifestyle factor medication use 2 . A brief physical examination document abnormality body appearance measurement weight , height waist circumference . 3 . Drawing blood forearm fast blood glucose ( blood sugar ) , lipid profile ( cholesterol fat blood ) , creatinine ( measure kidney function ) , complete blood count ( CBC ) . 4 . Collection urine HCG pregnancy test ( woman ) For blood test , ask eat drink anything ( except water ) 8 pm previous even arrive study visit follow morning . Samples blood store code use future research BIDMC investigator name identify . If reason decide withdraw study meet criterion enrollment study , blood drawn screen visit discard . Next , meet research dietician receive instruction 2-week run-in period ( see ) . 2 . Randomization Procedures : You randomly assign ( like flip coin ) receive either walnut contain milkshake placebo contain milkshake first visit . Each participant receive walnut contain milkshake one visit milkshake look taste without walnut ( placebo ) visit order visit randomize . 3 . Research Procedures : If qualify take part research study , undergo research procedure : Run-in period : You meet research dietician provide instruction maintain normal diet physical activity pattern avoid walnut-containing food drink . Study Visit 1 2 Each study visit involve 4-day ( 4 overnight ) stay General Clinical Research Center . You admit 9pm even first day visit . You ask complete hunger questionnaire morning anything eat . You receive milkshake morning contain either without walnut . We repeat hunger questionnaire lunch day . You provide lunch dinner base like eat . The calorie content lunch dinner control neither gain lose weight stay . Day 1 The following morning follow test perform ; Measure weight , waist circumference , blood pressure . Resting Metabolic Rate Fasting blood test Body composition Mixed meal challenge You receive first milkshake part mixed meal challenge . Day 2 On day 2 test complete hunger questionnaire receive another milkshake breakfast . Day 3 On day 3 follow test perform : Insulin Suppression Test Fasting blood sample At end insulin suppression test , receive another milkshake . Day 4 On morning last day repeat test first day visit leave hospital mid-day test complete . Washout phase Between 2 study visit enter washout phase continue normal healthy diet exercise avoid walnuts diet . After 1 month washout return GCRC second study visit . 4 . Tests perform study Resting Metabolic Rate RMR amount calorie burn without physical work . Your RMR measure commonly use instrument . You ask lie quietly bed stay awake large plastic hood head upper body 20 minute breathe normally air breathe collect . Fasting blood test Blood sample use measure sugar , insulin level , lipid ( LDL , HDL , total cholesterol , triglyceride ) , hormone ( leptin , resistin adiponectin ) blood marker inflammation ( TNF CRP ) . We also perform blood test measure expression gene involve metabolism white blood cell . For blood test , ask eat drink anything ( except water ) 8 pm previous evening . In addition , ask participate vigorous physical activity day visit . Samples blood store code use future relate blood measurement BIDMC investigator name identify . Body composition To measure amount fat body use bioelectrical impedance analysis . During procedure lie speed electric signal body measure . This signal painful . Mixed meal challenge You small catheter ( small plastic tube ) place vein needle forearm draw blood . This prevent need multiple needle stick require blood draw . The catheter tap stay place approximately three hour . You drink milkshake blood drawn catheter 15 min milkshake give 30-minute interval 3 hour measure metabolize nutrient drink . Insulin Suppression Test ( also call Galvin 's Index ) This test consist overnight fast ( nothing eat drink 11pm night ) , two IV line place arm . Glucose , insulin , octreotide ( hormone commonly use clinical practice treat several different disease ) albumin ( protein find blood ) infuse IV . Blood sample draw IV line time -10 minute , 0 minute , every 30 minute two half hour , every 10 minute additional 30 minute .</detailed_description>
