	<brief_title>Preoperative Chemo Chemoradiotherapy Adenocarcinoma Stomach Gastroesophageal Junction ( GEJ )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oxaliplatin 5-FU chemotherapy drug commonly use treat certain kind cancer . Folinic Acid ( leucovorin ) act 5-FU increase cancer cell death . Before treatment begin , ask question medical history complete physical exam . You around 1 tablespoon blood drawn routine test . You height weight measure . You chest x-ray electrocardiogram ( ECG - test measure electrical activity heart ) . You also chest x-ray , barium study upper gastrointestinal tract , CT scan check size location tumor . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . All patient routine upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy biopsy endoscopic ultrasound examination prior participate trial . However , participate trial , upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy repeat prior surgery . This procedure involve examination esophagus , stomach , duodenum flexible tube . Biopsies take necessary . You receive treatment 5-FU infusion vein use continuous 24- hour portable pump . This start Day 1 continue 48 hour . You need carry pump time 48 hour . The pump size Sony Walkman® . You also receive Oxaliplatin infusion vein 2 hour Day 1 . Folinic Acid give infusion vein 30 minute Day 1 . You 12 day recover chemotherapy treatment . These drug may give outpatient . Treatment repeat Day 15 . Two 14-day treatment period call one cycle . You receive 8 week chemotherapy ( 2 cycle ) . If cancer get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study doctor discus treatment option . Each week receive chemotherapy , around 1 tablespoon blood drawn routine test . Twelve day complete second cycle chemotherapy , begin receive chemoradiotherapy ( chemotherapy give time radiation therapy ) . Before chemoradiotherapy , give full physical , upper GI x-ray , tablespoon blood drawn routine blood test , need , CT abdomen , chest pelvis perform . You receive radiation therapy every weekday total 25 session . During radiation therapy , 5-FU infused vein use continuous infusion portable pump carry day night 5 day ( Monday Friday ) every week 5 week . On Day 1 radiation therapy week , give infusion Oxaliplatin vein 2 hour 5 week . During radiation therapy , evaluate week one tablespoon blood drawn routine blood test . Your doctor discus whether receive proton x-ray radiation . If receive proton radiation , give build 5-minute drive M. D. Anderson radiation clinic . If cancer get bad experience intolerable side effect , treatment may delay may take study doctor discus treatment option . Four six week completion chemoradiotherapy , stage cancer evaluate . This include draw blood ( tablespoon ) routine test , chest x-ray , CT abdomen , chest , pelvis ( necessary ) , upper GI endoscopy , abdominal disease staging ( necessary ) . When re-staging complete , surgical removal primary tumor lymph node attempt . All patient eligible surgery . The J-tube left body least 8 week surgery supplement nutrition . You ask fill side effect sheet throughout participation research study . You ask question regard nausea , hair loss , fatigue , meal , question regard daily activity . Following study , ask come follow-up visit M. D. Anderson 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month surgery . You come visit every 6 month Year 3 , year Year 5 . At visit , full physical , one tablespoon blood drawn routine test , chest x-ray , upper GI radiograph , upper GI endoscopy ( every visit ) CT abdomen ( need ) . This investigational study . Oxaliplatin FDA approve commercially available treatment advance colorectal cancer . Oxaliplatin approve US treatment gastric cancer . 5-FU folinic acid commercially available drug . The combination 3 drug ( Oxaliplatin + 5-FU + Folinic Acid ) investigational . A total 58 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
