	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) common , chronic , disable systemic autoimmune disease inflammation joint lining ( synovium ) occur body 's tissue attack immune system . The joint inflammation begin synovium slowly destroys cartilage , narrow joint eventually damage bone . A large amount inflammatory mediator rheumatoid factor synthesise joint accelerate proliferation differentiation immune cell amplify autoimmune reaction . A widely accept model emerge presence inflammation establish RA driven interaction T cell , macrophage , fibroblast abnormal microenvironment . Rheumatoid arthritis annual incidence approximately 0.2 per 1000 male 0.4 per 1000 female . In general , high rate report USA European population . The incidence RA increase age mid 70 . A prevalence 0.5-1 % report diverse population world-wide . Treatments RA focus relieve pain , reduce inflammation , slow stop joint damage , improve patient ' well ability function . Current therapy include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) target clinical feature disease alleviate pain swell accompany RA , disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) target actual cause disease biological agent genetically engineer target modify autoimmune response . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug effective managing symptom RA , limit suppress progression disease . First line treatment confirmation RA use DMARDs , support pain relief medication . Biologic agent ( TNF antagonist , anti B-cell agent anti-interleukins ) proven effective RA symptom management . TNF antagonists become important therapeutic option treatment advance RA .</detailed_description>
