	<brief_summary>Background Phototherapy UVB TL01 currently represent first choice treatment induce repigmentation vitiligo spot . The problem though system scale enable objective evaluation therapy , commonly know percentage repigmentation . Recently , European Task Force ( VETF , Vitiligo European Task Force ) expert vitiligo , within European Society Pigmentation , propose gravity classification basis three parameters/standards - extension , progression level depigmentation - use classify patient ten European centre . The aim trial validate VETF score system set relation therapeutic answer standard treatment vitiligo phototherapy . Leaving aside short term side effect , sunrush/erythema sunburn , reversible infrequent , main problem phototherapy represent cumulative long term effect ultraviolet ray . These cause premature age skin ( photoaging ) appearance skin cancer/neoplasia . Therefore aim get best result phototherapy whilst limit length . Aims trial : 1 . To validate VETF score system . As phototherapy currently universally accept treatment vitiligo , seem logical test VETF scoring system first evaluate effectiveness phototherapy . 2 . Secondly , target multicentric trial compare effectiveness two different phototherapy protocol ; first protocol foresees non-stop treatment 6 month ; second protocol foresees period interruption treatment . This help verify whether interrupt cycle phototherapy useful . This interruption might make ultraviolet ray effective 'stimulus melanocyte ' , may also reduce long term damage cause phototherapy .</brief_summary>
