	<brief_summary>This study randomize clinical trial design evaluate non-inferiority Bangerter filter compare 2 hour daily patch primary treatment moderate amblyopia ( 20/40 20/80 ) child age 3 &lt; 10 year . Secondary objective study ( 1 ) determine time course visual improvement Bangerter filter treatment , ( 2 ) compare patient quality life , measure modify Amblyopia Treatment Index , patient treat patch vs. Bangerter filter , ( 3 ) determine whether blur sound eye visual acuity bad amblyopic eye predict improvement acuity , ( 4 ) determine whether change fixation amblyopic eye predictive improvement visual acuity . The primary outcome assessment visual acuity 24 week amblyopic sound eye . The primary analytic approach amblyopic eye acuity involve construction one-sided 95 % confidence interval ass non-inferiority base treatment group comparison logMAR visual acuity score adjust baseline visual acuity score analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) model . Sound eye acuity data report treatment regimen 24-week visit mean change ( logMAR line ) baseline distribution number line change baseline .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Amblyopia common cause monocular visual impairment child , estimate affect many 3.6 % childhood population . The natural history amblyopia relatively unknown although report visual acuity may deteriorate without treatment . Although occlusion patch sound eye mainstay amblyopia therapy , alternative treatment pharmacological optical penalization may effective . In randomized , control clinical trial 419 child , 3 year less 7 year old moderate amblyopia , patch compare atropine . Although improvement atropine initially slow , treatment produce similar improvement 6 month . Although patch atropine proven effective treat amblyopia , neither treatment without adverse side effect . Patching associated compliance difficulty , need continuous monitoring , social stigma . Negative side effect observe child treat atropine include light sensitivity , facial flushing , fever . In randomized clinical trial compare patch atropine treatment amblyopia , questionnaire assess impact patch atropine treatment child family indicate treatment well tolerate overall , however , patch low compliance higher social stigma atropine . Bangerter filter , also know Bangerter foil , use mainly secondary amblyopia therapy follow patch atropine either improve maintain visual gain . One advantage Bangerter filter compare patch low density filter readily apparent therefore would expect increase patient compliance due reduce social stigma . Another advantage Bangerter filter opportunity skin irritation bandage adhesive , commonly-reported side effect patch . In addition , theoretical advantage Bangerter filter less disruptive binocular function treatment compare modality patch . Few data available compare Bangerter filter patch treatment amblyopia . Bonsall randomize 14 patient , 3 10 year old , previously untreated strabismic/anisometropic amblyopia either 6 hour daily patch full-time Bangerter filter . Baseline amblyopic eye acuity 20/30 20/400 patch group 20/30 20/200 Bangerter group . The Bangerter filter prescribe minimum density foil need elicit switch fixation sound eye amblyopic eye . Visual acuity measure every 6-8 week amblyopic eye visual acuity equal sound eye , improvement achieve 5 14 time study stop . The average time achieve equal vision amblyopic sound eyes 4.5 month ( 142 day ) foil group versus 9 month ( 272 day ) patch group . Both form therapy equally tolerate . Despite good preliminary data , large randomize clinical trial compare effectiveness Bangerter filter patch treatment amblyopia yet conduct .</detailed_description>
