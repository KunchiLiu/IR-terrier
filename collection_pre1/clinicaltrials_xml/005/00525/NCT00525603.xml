	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : 1 . Evaluate ability Cyclophosphamide , Fludarabine , Alemtuzumab , Rituximab ( CFAR ) increase proportion patient &lt; 5 % CD5/CD19+ cell bone marrow 66 % follow 3 course treatment without significantly increase incidence pneumonia sepsis compare historic group patient treat combination fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab ( FCR ) . Second Objectives : 1 . Assess complete remission ( CR ) , nodular partial remission ( nPR ) , partial remission ( PR ) rate ( overall response ) high-risk , previously untreated patient CLL treat CFAR . 2 . Evaluate molecular remission bone marrow polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene responder treat CFAR . 3 . Assess immune parameter include blood T cell count subset distribution serum immunoglobulin level pretreatment , treatment , post-treatment patient treat CFAR .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fludarabine chemotherapy drug approve treatment patient Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) . Cyclophosphamide also chemotherapy drug commonly use treat patient CLL . Rituximab alemtuzumab special protein ( antibody ) specifically target attach protein leukemia cell . These targeted protein may also present normal blood cell . When antibody bind protein leukemia cell , may help stop slow growth disease . The combination fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab use treatment previously untreated patient CLL . The purpose study see added benefit addition alemtuzumab combination . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete physical exam , include routine blood test ( 3 tablespoon ) . You may either chest x-ray computerized tomography ( CT ) scan doctor think necessary . If bone marrow biopsy collect past 4 month , bone marrow sample collect time . To collect bone marrow biopsy , area hip chest bone numb anaesthetic , small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . Women able child must negative blood urine pregnancy test . If find eligible take part study , may begin treatment . During study , 6 `` cycle '' treatment . A cycle make treatment study drug 5 day row , around 3 half week ( 23 day ) treatment study drug . On Days 1 , 3 , 5 cycle , receive alemtuzumab needle vein . On Day 2 cycle receive rituximab needle vein . Cyclophosphamide fludarabine give separately Days 3 , 4 , 5 cycle needle vein . In addition study drug , may also give premedication fluid vein help decrease risk side effect . The premedication may include steroid use decrease risk side effect alemtuzumab rituximab . They give dose alemtuzumab rituximab . The infusion daily treatment visit take less 6 hour . This treatment give outpatient basis . The combination treatment repeat every 4 week ( 1 cycle ) total 6 cycle . You receive acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) mouth diphenhydramine hydrochloride ( Benadryl ) mouth vein 30-60 minute dose rituximab alemtuzumab . You also receive hydrocortisone ( steroid ) vein first dose alemtuzumab cycle . These drug use help decrease risk side effect . If side effect occur treatment , dose drug may adjust ( ) symptoms go . Also , experience side effect treatment , must stay clinic observe , 2 hour drug give . During treatment 2 month completion treatment , need take antibiotic decrease risk develop infection . Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( Bactrim DS , SMX ) sulfa-drug , give decrease risk type pneumonia call PCP pneumonia . If allergic sulfa drug , similar antibiotic may give . You take Valtrex decrease risk potential virus reactivation , include herpes . If allergic Valtrex , similar antibiotic may give . You may receive antibiotic call valganciclovir ( Valcyte ) decrease risk another virus call cytomegalovirus . You may also take allopurinol first week first course treatment . This help decrease risk kidney damage rapid destruction leukemia cell . During Cycle 1 treatment , blood drawn ( 2 tablespoon ) routine blood test week . Then , blood test repeat start additional cycle ( every 4 week ) . You also see treat doctor provide history routine physical exam do cycle treatment . After 3 cycle treatment , physical exam routine blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) . You may also either x-ray CT scan . You another bone marrow sample collect . These test use see disease respond treatment . If find disease respond treatment first 3 cycle therapy , take study , doctor discus treatment option . If find disease respond treatment , another 3 cycle ( 12 week ) treatment give . During additional 3 cycle therapy , blood drawn ( 2 tablespoon ) week routine blood test . After 6 cycle treatment , physical exam , around 2 tablespoon blood drawn routine blood test , bone marrow aspirate biopsy determine leukemia remission . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study , doctor discus treatment option . Around 3-6 month receive last treatment cycle , physical exam routine blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) . After , physical exam routine blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) every 6 month next 2 year . If leukemia go remission , bone marrow aspirate biopsy 6 month , 1 year , 2 year last treatment cycle , make sure stay remission . If disease return start new therapy , need return visit . However , inform study doctor/staff receive treatment . This investigational study . All drug use study FDA approve commercially available . Their use together study , however , experimental . As many 60 patient take part study . All enrol M.D . Anderson .</detailed_description>
