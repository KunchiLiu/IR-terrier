	<brief_summary>Azathioprine ( AZA ) long used dermatology treat autoimmune bullous dermatosis generalize eczematous disorder well photodermatoses . Its metabolic process inside human body side effect rely genetic polymorphism enzyme thiopurine s-methyltransferase ( TPMT ) inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase gene ( ITPA ) . This study aim analyze relative contribution TMPT ITPA mutation development toxicity induce AZA treatment detect correlation genetic polymorphism .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dermatologists use azathioprine 30 year . This synthetic purine analog derive 6-mercaptopurine . It think act disrupt nucleic acid synthesis recently find interfere T-cell activation . The recognize us azathioprine dermatology immunobullous disease , generalize eczematous disorder , photodermatoses . Azathioprine extensively metabolize , 2 % excrete , unchanged , urine . Once freed imidazole derivative , mercaptopurine moiety undergoes metabolism 3 compete enzyme . Activity 2 catabolic enzyme thiopurine s-methyltransferase ( TPMT ) , enzyme great genetic polymorphism , xanthine oxidase ( XO ) produce inactive metabolite . Decreased TPMT XO activity result increase production toxic metabolite . Decreased TPMT activity frequently consequence genetic polymorphism , decrease XO activity may mediate medication allopurinol . Azathioprine generally well tolerate favorable therapeutic index compare many traditional immunosuppressant . Dose-limiting toxicity azathioprine treatment affect 37 % patient . Administration azathioprine patient TPMT deficiency result significant accumulation thioguanine nucleotide , become clinically manifest increase hematopoietic toxicity , potentially grave consequence . Screening thiopurine methyltransferase ( TPMT ) polymorphism , TPMT*3A , *3C , *2 prospectively identify approximately 10 % patient . In Chinese , report incidence homozygous wild-type、heterozygote、homozygous mutation TPMT 95.3 % , 4.7 % 0 % respectively . The relationship hematologic complication establish , relationship gastrointestinal side effect controversial . Genetic polymorphism newly identify enzyme , inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase gene ( ITPA ) also associate adverse effect azathioprine , flu-like symptom , rash pancreatitis . ITPA 94C &gt; A allele find low frequency Central/South American population ( 1-2 % ) , constant frequency across Caucasian African population ( 6-7 % ) , high Asian population ( 14-19 % ) . The aim study determine relative contribution , TMPT ( A719G ) ITPA ( C94A ) mutation development toxicity induce AZA treatment dermatology patient detect correlation two genetic polymorphism . Hepatotoxicity define serum alanine transaminase level great twice upper normal limit ( 50 IU/l ) resolution withdrawal AZA ; pancreatitis severe abdominal pain serum amylase &gt; 800 IU/l ; neutropenia neutrophil count &lt; 2.0 × 109 cell .</detailed_description>
