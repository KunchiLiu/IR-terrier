	<brief_summary>The major cause premature death renal transplant recipient cardio-vascular disease . In addition , obesity become major problem patient population . Rimonabant seem weight reduce property also weight reduction independent effect insulin sensitivity endothelial function , two important cardio-vascular risk factor . Rimonabant therefore interesting drug treatment transplant patient . Present data also indicate rimonabant interact essential immunosuppressive drug ( CsA Tac ) indicate probably safe administer patient population . However need investigated proper manner .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interaction Between Rimonabant Cyclosporine Tacrolimus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal transplant recipient treat life-long immunosuppressive therapy order prevent acute rejection episode . The calcineurin inhibitor ( CsA Tac ) back-bones immunosuppressive treatment narrow therapeutic index . It therefore essential assure new drug use transplanted patient interact CsA Tac . Even though rimonabant metabolize via enzyme CsA Tac ( CYP3A4 ) previous vitro vivo study relevant probe drug healthy volunteer indicate presence relevant pharmacokinetic interaction . However , absolutely sure safe administer rimonabant transplant patient 12-hour pharmacokinetic interaction investigation include 16 patient present pilot study ( 8 patient CsA 8 patient Tac ) .</detailed_description>
