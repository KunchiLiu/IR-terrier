	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn temozolomide alone give pegylated interferon alpha-2b help control metastatic melanoma . Researchers also want study safety 2 treatment . Objectives : 1 . To determine anti-tumor activity ( pathological response CR+PR ) toxicity temozolomide ( TMZ ) alone combination pegylated interferon alpha-2b ( PGI ) patient resectable stage IIIC stage IV ( M1a ) metastatic melanoma prior definitive surgical resection . 2 . To determine relapse-free survival , overall survival impact tumor response chemotherapy patient . 3 . To differentiate vivo treatment effect TMZ alone vs.TMZ plus PGI correlate clinical outcome analysis pre- post-treatment tumor peripheral blood mononuclear cell respect : 1 ) Known cellular molecular marker apoptosis cell proliferation , 2 ) Promotor methylation status DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) , 3 ) DNA sequence variability tumor suppressor gene DNA repair enzyme , 4 ) Tumor genomic expression profile analysis complementary DNA ( cDNA ) microarray protein array</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Temozolomide drug design work stop cancer cell make new DNA . If make DNA , ca n't split 2 new cancer cell . Pegylated Interferon alpha-2b protein make human immune system help fight viral infection regulate cell function . If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two treatment group ( Arm A Arm B ) . You equal chance assign either group get treatment assign group . You know group assign . Arm A : Participants group take temozolomide day 7 day row . This follow 7 day without treatment . This repeat 3 time ( total 8 week - 1 cycle ) routine surgery . Arm B : Participants group take temozolomide schedule Arm A . However , participant group also receive pegylated interferon alpha-2b injection skin week total 8 week routine surgery . Tylenol give participant group pegylated interferon alpha-2b injection . After first injection , also need stay clinic 2 hour observation . Your body weight used calculating dosage Temozolomide . You blood ( 1 tablespoon time ) drawn 2 time , check response treatment . The first sample drawn start treatment . The second sample drawn around Day 57 treatment . On Days 15 , 29 , 43 , 57 treatment , ask illness experienced medication may take . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . You tumor measurement performance status evaluation . You also 1 tablespoon blood drawn routine test visit . Any side effect may experience also record . All participant receive 1 cycle ( 8 week ) treatment follow surgery remove tumor . The size tumor closely monitor study treatment . If tumor increase size 50 % ( half ) great , study treatment stop immediately surgery . If stop treatment due side effect drug ( ) , may able start side effect go away decreased severity enough . However , time therapy count towards total 8 week receive treatment . If recovery side effect require total 8 week start treatment , remove study receive surgery . Tumor blood sample collect surgery check disease respond treatment . Your routine surgery schedule take place 90 day follow completion treatment soon blood count recover normal level . After surgery , experience side effect study drug , show stable disease respond treatment , able receive 3 additional cycle therapy ( 24 week ) . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign routine blood test ( 1 tablespoon ) every 4 week . You follow every 3 month routine blood test ( 1 tablespoon time ) first 3 year , every 6 month 8 year . After , follow-up discretion primary physician . CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis perform cycle therapy 3 additional cycle , every 6 month 5 year , discretion primary physician . This investigational study . Temozolomide alone give pegylated interferon alpha-2b authorize use research . Neither drug currently approve FDA treatment . About 124 patient enrol study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically documented diagnosis melanoma metastasis . 2 . Stage IIIB/IIIC ( N2b , N2c N3 ) stage IV ( M1a ) melanoma patient measurable potentially resectable metastasis without clinical radiological evidence distant metastasis . 3 . An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . 4 . Age 18 old . 5 . Adequate organ function define follow : . ) Absolute granulocyte great equal 1,000/mm^3 Platelets great equal 100,000/mm^3 , b . ) Serum bilirubin serum creatinine less equal 1.5 time upper limit laboratory normal . If serum creatinine great 1.5 time upper limit laboratory normal , urine creatinine clearance must great 60 ml/min. , c. ) serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase ( SGOT ) ( AST ) , serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase ( SGPT ) ( ALT ) alkaline phosphatase less equal 3 time upper limit laboratory normal . 6 . Patients previous systemic chemotherapy metastatic melanoma . Prior biologic therapy , target therapy immunotherapy allowable , must least 2 week since prior therapy start study drug . No concurrent chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy . 7 . Prior radiation therapy use enhance local regional control permit , must least 2 week since prior therapy start study drug . In addition , patient must unirradiated metastatic site response evaluation fully recover toxicity . Lesions within prior field radiation may use indicator lesion recent evidence disease progression . 8 . Ability understand sign inform consent form , indicate awareness investigational nature study . 1 . Significant cardiac pulmonary dysfunction , history severe cardiovascular disease , myocardial infarction within 6 month start treatment , unstable angina , Class III Class IV congestive heart failure , ventricular arrhythmia , uncontrolled arrhythmia . 2 . Current significant psychiatric illness . 3 . Serious infection require intravenous antibiotic , nonmalignant medical illness uncontrolled whose control may jeopardize complication therapy . 4 . Frequent vomit medical condition ( e.g . partial bowel obstruction ) could interfere oral medication intake . 5 . Autoimmune immunosuppressive disorder ( e.g . HIV AIDSrelated illness ) . 6 . Patients require therapy systemic corticosteroid . 7 . No evidence active secondary malignancy require chemotherapy within past 2 year ( exclude nonmelanoma skin cancer , and/or carcinoma insitu ) 8 . Pregnant lactate woman ineligible . Women childbearing potential must negative urine pregnancy test within week initiation therapy . All patient must agree use medically approve contraceptive measure prevent pregnancy treatment . 9 . Any medical condition reason , principal investigator 's opinion , make patient unsuitable participate clinical trial .</criteria>
