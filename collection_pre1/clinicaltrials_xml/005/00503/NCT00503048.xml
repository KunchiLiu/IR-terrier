	<detailed_description>There many study regard possible cause increase trend frequency allergic disease last three decade . Main cause trend : decrease infectious disease frequency , improvement life level , change diet lactic acid bacteria elimination digestive tract . Less exposition microbe lead disturbance optimal balance Th1 Th2 lymphocytes , prevalence Th2 cytokines excessively high production IgE . Decreased exposure microbe result loss main source immune provocation , consequent increase pathogenic immune response associate disease . Molecular interaction immunocytes microbe mediate largely Toll-like receptor ( TLRs ) host cell diversity ligands produced virus , bacteria fungi . Many study confirm protective role viral , bacterial parasite infection atopy development . The studied group consist 500 child , live ten community foster home Lodz . The reference group consist 500 child , live parent home , recruit primary care centre . Primary Purpose study compare prevalence atopy atopic diseases two child population : foster care reference child - define risk protective factor development atopy . Secondary Purpose genotyping cytometric study - define risk protective factor development atopy . Primary outcome measure : skin prick test result 18 allergen , peripheral blood eosinophil count , level total specific IgE child positive skin-test result secondary point , spirometry , medical history physical examination . Secondary outcome measure : include symptom asthma allergic disease , lung function , parental allergy child reference group , family history include life condition early childhood , marker allergy total IgE serum concentration eosinophil blood count , expression TLR2 , TLR4 , TLR7 , TLR9 , examine serum sample specific antibody Toxocara sp , Toxoplasma gondi , Ascaris lumbricoides , DNA .</detailed_description>
