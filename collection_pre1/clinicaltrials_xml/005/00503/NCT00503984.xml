	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study Azacitidine , Docetaxel , Prednisone Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design A phase I/II clinical trial patient hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer . Primary objective phase I component study : To determine safe potentially efficacious phase II dose azacitidine combination docetaxel prednisone use treatment hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer . Primary objective phase II component study : To determine therapeutic efficacy combine therapy azacitidine , docetaxel , prednisone , treatment hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer . The primary measure therapeutic efficacy response , define prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response , complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) . Secondary endpoint toxicity , duration response , progression-free survival , overall survival .</detailed_description>
