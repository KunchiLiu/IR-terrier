	<brief_title>Erlotinib Treating Women Undergoing Surgery For Stage I , Stage II , Stage III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To estimate effect erlotinib hydrochloride expression interleukin ( IL ) -1α patient estrogen receptor ( ER- ) -negative , EGFR-positive IL-1α-positive breast cancer . Secondary - To estimate effect erlotinib hydrochloride expression nuclear NF-κB amphiregulin ( AR ) patient ER-negative , EGFR-positive IL-1α-positive breast cancer . - To estimate effect erlotinib tumor cell proliferation ( Ki67 ) apoptosis ( TUNEL ) . - To estimate rate IL-1α , nuclear NF-κB , AR expression patient ER-negative , EGFR-positive breast cancer . - To follow clinical course patient resectable ER-negative , EGFR-positive IL-1α-positive breast cancer . - To assess toxicity 15-day regimen daily oral administration erlotinib hydrochloride participant ER-negative , EGFR-positive IL-1α-positive breast cancer . OUTLINE : This open-label , pilot study . Patients stratify accord HER2 status ( positive v negative ) . Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily day -14 0 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo surgery day 0 . Tissue sample collect baseline examine expression estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor , HER2 , EGFR , interleukin ( IL ) -1α , amphiregulin , NF-kB . Tissue sample collect surgery examine IL-1α , NF-kB , amphiregulin IHC . Following surgery , patient contact 1 week post-surgery ( ± 1 day ) 1 week post-withdrawal study ( ± 1 day ) phone call clinic visit ass toxicity . After , patient follow treated accord standard care practice . If patient choose follow-up oncologist outside institution , oncologist contact every 6 month update information condition .</detailed_description>
