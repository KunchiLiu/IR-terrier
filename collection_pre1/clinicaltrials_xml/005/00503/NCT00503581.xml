	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine frequency complete remission central pathology review panel diagnose endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia ( EIN ) patient treat 24 week oral continuous versus interrupt progestin therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate whether quality life superior patient take continuous megestrol versus sequential megestrol evaluate mood , concern weight change bleed . TERTIARY : I . To assess expression level PTEN use immunohistochemistry explore association PTEN expression level patient response treatment . II . To assess expression level hormone receptor ER PR use immunohistochemistry explore association ER/PR expression level patient response treatment . III . To assess histomorphometry karyometry characteristic pre-treatment biopsy patient population . IV . To identify pattern protein glycoprotein expression associate invasive cancer serum specimen obtain patient diagnosis atypical endometrial hyperplasia ( AEH ) EIN . V. To assess difference plasma concentration megestrol acetate HPLC patient population . VI . To assess patient compliance treatment regimen use HPLC . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord collection method initial/intake biopsy ( dilatation curettage v method ) . Patients randomize 1 follow treatment regimen : REGIMEN 1 : Patients receive oral megestrol twice daily every day 24 week . Approximately twelve week treatment start , clinical blood test obtain research serum plasma collect . Twenty-four week constitute one course treatment pill count perform 12-week f/u visit completion treatment course determine compliance . After progestin therapy patient induced-withdrawal bleed . Patients arm undergo re-evaluation biopsy hysterectomy minimum two week maximum eight week complete megestrol treatment . REGIMEN 2 : Patients receive oral megestrol twice daily two week continuously follow treatment two week . This course repeat total 24 week . Approximately twelve week treatment start , clinical blood test obtain research serum plasma collect . Twenty-four week constitute one course treatment pill count perform 12-week f/u visit completion treatment course determine compliance . After progestin therapy patient induced-withdrawal bleed . Patients arm undergo re-evaluation biopsy hysterectomy minimum two week maximum eight week megestrol treatment . REGIMEN 3 : ( Closed 6/3/2010 ) Patients receive megestrol . At discretion manage physician , patient undergo re-evaluation biopsy hysterectomy anytime 2-20 week enrollment randomization . Patients undergo biopsy blood sample collection periodically immunological pharmacodynamic study . Samples analyze presence absence myoinvasion deep myoinvasion hysterectomy specimen , hormone receptivity status , compare PTEN status treatment via karyometry morphometry , expression VEGF tenascin-C ( TN-C ) via ELISA , presence TN-C fragmentation via western immunoblots , additional biomarkers via proteomic analysis , protein glycoprotein expression pattern via electrophoresis image analysis , plasma megestrol concentration via high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) . Patients complete Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) two item bleed weight gain baseline periodically study . A Treatment Decision Assessment complete baseline , patient withdraw study , Study Withdraw Assessment also complete . There additional follow-up study patient 's hysterectomy .</detailed_description>
