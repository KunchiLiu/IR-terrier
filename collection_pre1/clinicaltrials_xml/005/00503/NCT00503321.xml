	<brief_summary>A randomize control study conduct unresectable advanced gastric carcinoma recurrent gastric carcinoma compare TS-1 therapy TS-1 + PSK therapy . The primary endpoint study progression-free survival ( PFS ) , secondary endpoint anticancer effect , time treatment failure ( TTF ) , QOL ( FACT-BRM ) , compliance , adverse drug reaction immunological factor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study TS-1 Therapy TS-1+PSK Therapy Against Advanced Gastric Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tegafur / gimeracil / oteracil potassium ( TS-1 ) widely use first-line drug unresectable advanced gastric carcinoma recurrent gastric carcinoma Japan response rate TS-1 gastric carcinoma report excellent 46.5 % phase II study . However , since adverse drug reaction tend occur patient treat standard regimen TS-1 , drug reduction discontinuation often require , one drawback drug . On hand , although Krestin ( PSK ) report show survival effect postoperative immunochemotherapy gastric carcinoma , efficacy PSK establish patient unresectable advanced gastric carcinoma recurrent gastric carcinoma . Since main effect PSK recover physiological function , include immune function host , expect PSK would improve compliance TS-1 alleviate adverse drug reaction TS-1 therapy concomitant use TS-1 PSK would result improvement treatment result . Therefore , decide conduct randomize phase II study patient unresectable advanced gastric carcinoma recurrent gastric carcinoma compare TS-1 therapy TS-1+PSK therapy .</detailed_description>
