	<brief_summary>Each participant administer 2 injection saline - first right gluteal area second leave gluteal area . Both injection administer intra-muscularly clinician . One injection give vacuum ( Pneumatic Skin Flattening PSF Machine ) without vacuum . The order injection randomly assign . Each subject serve control . Between injection 30 min pause give minimize pain sensation bias previous injection . Immediately injection pain level assess VAS scale . The researcher assess pain blind type injection give . The evaluation pain reduction make comparison pain level without application PSF . Hypothesis : PSF Technique reduce pain associate saline injection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Pain Reduction Administration Saline Injections Usage Pneumatic Skin Flattening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Injections currently gold-standard administrate various medication parenterally . The significant side-effect related injection accompany pain . Injection pain related penetration skin needle mechanical chemical effect drug injection . This pain remain major obstacle medication administration child well population subject needle-phobia pain experience . The associated pain may thus prevent optimized medical care patient . Current method alleviate immediate pain include utilization topical anesthesia whereas patient utilize form pain relief simply endure pain injection . Other method pain reduction taking advantage apply pressure vibration alleviate pain . These method result number pain relieve device currently market . Such predicate device primarily involve vibration device commonly use alleviate injection pain . Published data suggests possible use pressure application mechanism pain alleviation relate injection . We suggest , first time , use Pneumatic Skin Flattening ( PSF ) technology alleviation pain associated injection . The PSF technology currently use worldwide FDA clear Serenity device ( Serenity , Inolase Ltd. ) pain reduction hair removal . The device generate contact compression transparent sapphire window skin . The compression creatures pressure signal , base gate theory , though depress pain associate hair removal treatment . We assume mechanism would apply reduction pain associate injection . Comparison : Intra-Subject pain level change injection PSF without PSF</detailed_description>
