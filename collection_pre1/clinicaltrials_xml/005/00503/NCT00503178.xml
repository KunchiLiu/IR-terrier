	<brief_summary>Highly selective irradiation require accurate target definition high-resolution three-dimensional imaging . Co-registration FDG-PET high-resolution CT might image modality choice . This choice might target radiation therapy precisely intra-osseous volume responsible pain spare selectively healthy bone vicinity metastasis . This strategy could result equal anti-pain efficacy conventional large volume radiotherapy , could allow bone remodel preservation bone structural strength vicinity could lead reduce toxicity neighbor organ .</brief_summary>
