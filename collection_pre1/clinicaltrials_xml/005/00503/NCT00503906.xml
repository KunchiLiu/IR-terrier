	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation together bevacizumab gemcitabine may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation together bevacizumab gemcitabine work first-line therapy treat patient metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine preliminary evidence efficacy combination regimen gemcitabine hydrochloride , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ( Abraxane® ) , bevacizumab first-line treatment Her2/neu-negative metastatic ( stage IV ) breast cancer . Secondary - To determine partial , complete , overall response rate . - To determine safety side effect profile treatment combination . - To explore relationship circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) disease progression , measure CTC baseline course treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute follow paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ( Abraxane® ) IV 30 minute follow bevacizumab IV 30 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo tumor tissue blood sample collection periodically correlative laboratory study . Tumor tissue sample analyze secreted protein acidic rich cysteine ( SPARC ) expression antibody immunostaining . Blood sample analyze presence circulate tumor cell CellSearch™ system . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
