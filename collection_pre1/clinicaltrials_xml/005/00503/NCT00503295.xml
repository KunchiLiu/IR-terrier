	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study REOLYSIN® Treatment Bone Soft Tissue Sarcomas Metastatic Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sarcomas uncommon mesenchymal malignancy encompass variety tumor soft tissue bone . Included study patient osteosarcoma , Ewing sarcoma family tumor , malignant fibrous histiocytoma , synovial sarcoma , leiomyosarcoma fibrosarcoma . Patients lesion present metastatic disease remain largely incurable . In sarcoma , lung far frequent site metastasis . There need new therapy activity type sarcoma . REOLYSIN® unmodified oncolytic reovirus replicate selectively ras transform cell cause cell lysis . Activating mutation ras mutation oncogene signal ra pathway may occur many 80 % human tumor . Such mutation describe many common sarcoma childhood adult . REOLYSIN® demonstrate excellent anti-tumor activity vitro vivo childhood sarcoma cell line . Further support development REOLYSIN® context sarcoma detail study , fact sarcoma resistant refractory conventional chemotherapy may remain clinically responsive viral therapy . Sarcoma patient pulmonary metastasis may especially suitable study REOLYSIN® due rapid selective uptake virus lung . This Phase 2 study design characterize efficacy safety REOLYSIN® give intravenously 5 day every 4 week patient bone soft tissue sarcoma metastatic lung . Safety data , include laboratory parameter adverse event , collect patient order determine toxicity reversibility toxicity REOLYSIN® therapy . Response assess use radiographic image every 2 cycle therapy . OBJECTIVES : 1 . To measure tumor response duration response , describe evidence antitumor activity intravenous multiple dose REOLYSIN® patient bone soft tissue sarcoma metastatic lung . 2 . To evaluate safety intravenous multiple dose REOLYSIN® .</detailed_description>
