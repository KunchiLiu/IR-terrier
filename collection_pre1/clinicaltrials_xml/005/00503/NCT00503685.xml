Toxicity plan treatment break regard adequate evidence disease progression patient eligible trial The patient receive least one prior standard and/or investigational regimen metastatic disease The patient age ≥ 18 year The patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ( ECOG PS ) 01 ( Karnofsky ≥ 80 % ) The patient adequate hematologic function define absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/μL , hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL , platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL The patient adequate hepatic function define total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , * aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 3 x ULN ( ≤ 5 x ULN presence know liver metastasis ) The patient adequate coagulation function define international normalized ratio ( INR ) ≤ 1.5 partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) ≤ 1.5 x ULN . Patients fulldose anticoagulation must stable dose oral anticoagulant low molecular weight heparin , warfarin must INR 2 3 active bleed pathological condition carry high risk bleeding ( eg , tumor involve major vessel invade rectal lumen , know varix ) The patient adequate renal function define serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x institutional ULN creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min patient creatinine level ULN , well urine protein ≤ 1+ urine dipstick routine urinalysis ( urine dipstick/routine UA indicate ≥ 2+ protein , 24hour urine collection protein must demonstrate &lt; 1000 mg protein 24 hour allow participation study ) The patient fast serum glucose &lt; 120 mg/dL ULN The patient life expectancy &gt; 3 month Because teratogenicity IMCA12 ( cixutumumab ) know , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation The patient ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document The patient tumor KRAS wildtype ( absence mutation codon 12 13 , determine DxS KRAS Mutation Kit [ PCRbased analysis ] ) . The patient experience either confirm partial response stable disease ≥ 24 week duration prior treatment cetuximab panitumumabcontaining regimen *Except patient UGT1A1 promoter polymorphism , ie , Gilbert syndrome , confirm genotyping Invader®UGT1A1 Molecular Assay prior enrollment . Patients enrol Gilbert Syndrome must total bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN . If patient liver metastasis , total bilirubin must ≤ 3 x ULN . Exclusion Criteria The patient receive chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Neurotoxicity , present , must recover NCICTCAE Version 3.0 grade ≤ 2 . The patient receive investigational agent ( ) . The patient history treatment agent target IGFR . The patient know brain leptomeningeal metastasis . The patient history primary central nervous system tumor , seizure well control standard medical therapy , history stroke within 6 month prior randomization . The patient history allergic reaction attribute compound chemical biologic composition similar cetuximab IMCA12 ( cixutumumab ) . The patient poorly control diabetes mellitus . Patients history diabetes mellitus allow participate , provide blood glucose within normal range ( fast glucose &lt; 120 mg/dL ULN ) stable dietary therapeutic regimen condition . The patient uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection require parenteral antibiotic , symptomatic congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . The patient pregnant lactating . The patient know positive infection human immunodeficiency virus . The patient receive therapy immune modulators cyclosporine tacrolimus . The patient history another primary cancer , exception : ) curatively resect nonmelanomatous skin cancer ; b ) curatively treated cervical carcinoma insitu ; c ) primary solid tumor curatively resect treated know active disease present treatment administer last 3 year .</criteria>
