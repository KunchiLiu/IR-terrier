	<detailed_description>Proton beam use deliver high dose radiation treatment area spar surround normal tissue . Capecitabine drug interfere growth cancer cell . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete physical exam . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Urine collect routine test . Chest x-rays compute tomography ( CT ) scan abdomen ( stomach area ) pelvis do . Women able child must negative blood urine pregnancy test . If find eligible take part study , receive radiation therapy 1 time day , 5 day row ( Monday-Friday ) 6 -7 week ( 30-35 treatment ) . You take chemotherapy drug , capecitabine , mouth 2 time day , morning night , day receive radiation therapy . These pill take Saturday Sunday . These pill take within 30 minute eat full glass water . During study , every week physical exam blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check side effect chemotherapy radiation therapy . You ask side effect experience . You evaluate surgeon 4-6 week completion treatment . Those tumor surgically remove surgery remove tumor 6-8 week completion treatment , would standard care disease . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Two ( 2 ) week complete radiation therapy , follow-up visit . At visit , physical exam . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect routine test . You ask side effect experience . Six ( 6 ) week complete radiation therapy , follow-up visit . At visit , physical exam , chest x-ray , CT scan abdomen pelvis . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . You ask side effect experience . After finish treatment , follow-up visit every 3 month first 2 year , every 6 month . At visit , physical exam . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . You chest x-ray CT scan abdomen pelvis . You ask side effect experience . One ( 1 ) year finish treatment , also colonoscopy sigmoidoscopy . You receive separate consent procedure . After participation study , follow-up evaluation need standard care . This investigational study . Capecitabine FDA approve treat colon cancer surgery , treat metastatic colorectal cancer . The use capecitabine proton beam therapy study investigational . About 50 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
