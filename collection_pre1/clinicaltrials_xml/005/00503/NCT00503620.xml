	<brief_summary>Botulinum toxin injection common form treatment child cerebral palsy help reduce muscle tightness help walk without resort surgery . While treatment beneficial , require therapy repeat every six month , costly may eventually result therapy effective time . The study conduct Shriners Hospitals Children , Philadelphia , examine effect botulinum toxin injection , walk , change cause muscle , brain spinal cord . The change muscle , brain spinal cord , call neuromuscular plasticity , extensively examine response botulinum toxin , could provide insight botulinum toxin work make effective . This study focus child cerebral palsy age 4 12 year , one leg involve would normally receive botulinum toxin injection low leg help improve walking . The child ask come hospital full day receive injection , four twelve week look change muscle , brain spinal cord . This involve record walk , measurement muscle reflex , record brain activity move ankle ( also know functional magnetic resonance image fMRI ) . A group child typical development also ask participate study act comparison group . The researcher believe examine change muscle , brain spinal cord response injection aid understanding well use botulinum toxin achieve well longer lasting change .</brief_summary>
