	<brief_title>Enzastaurin Treating Young Patients With Refractory Primary CNS Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend phase II dose enzastaurin hydrochloride child recurrent refractory CNS tumor receive enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant . - To characterize pharmacokinetics toxicity recommend phase II dose enzastaurin hydrochloride give twice daily patient . Secondary - To characterize pharmacokinetics enzastaurin hydrochloride recommend phase II dose give day twice day child . - To document describe toxicity associate enzastaurin hydrochloride . - To document antitumor activity child recurrent refractory CNS tumor . - To explore change MR perfusion scan obtain within 15 ± 2 day initiation enzastaurin hydrochloride therapy compare baseline correlate change clinical outcome . - To evaluate panel biological surrogate marker patient population baseline follow enzastaurin hydrochloride administration . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral enzastaurin hydrochloride daily maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . Patients receive enzastaurin hydrochloride MTD twice daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may receive 13 additional course ( total 26 course ) oral enzastaurin hydrochloride patient benefit treatment investigator subject agree continue treatment . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically pharmacokinetic study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
