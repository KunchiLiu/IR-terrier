	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Pemetrexed may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving pemetrexed together oxaliplatin may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give pemetrexed together oxaliplatin work treat patient locally advanced head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pemetrexed Oxaliplatin Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate clinical response rate patient locally advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck treat neoadjuvant pemetrexed disodium oxaliplatin . Secondary - To evaluate pathological complete response patient undergo surgical resection post-induction biopsy . - To assess toxicity therapy , include assessment quality life , fatigue , head neck cancer-related symptom . - To predict response toxicity base pharmacogenomics , genomics , proteomics . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , open-label study . Patients assign 1 2 group base resectability disease ( resectable v nonresectable ) . - Group I ( resectable disease ) : Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 4 course . If patient progress receive 4 course treatment , treatment discontinue patient proceed surgery . After completion pemetrexed disodium oxaliplatin , patient undergo surgical resection disease . - Group II ( nonresectable disease ) : Patients receive treatment group I . If patient progress receive 4 course treatment , treatment discontinue patient proceed concurrent chemoradiotherapy . After completion pemetrexed disodium oxaliplatin , patient undergo concurrent chemoradiotherapy . Blood sample collect baseline periodically study biomarker pharmacokinetic study . Quality life assess prior course therapy 4-6 week last course . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
