	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome afflicts least 2 - 4 % adult associate significant morbidity mortality . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy primary treatment sleep apnea adult , non-adherence CPAP limit effectiveness . Even maximal medical therapy , nasal obstruction common sleep apnea patient may hamper CPAP adherence efficacy . However , common cause nasal obstruction sleep apnea patient ( turbinate hypertrophy ) surgically correctable . Treatment nasal obstruction may lead successful use CPAP . The long-term goal propose research develop novel , multi-disciplinary , multi-modal approach therapy , order improve clinically important treatment outcome sleep apnea . The short-term objective proposal : 1 . Quantify effect nasal turbinate reduction nasal airway ; 2 . Determine whether turbinate reduction increase CPAP use efficacy ; 3 . Determine whether turbinate reduction positively influence CPAP treatment outcomes . We employ single-site , randomize , double-blind , sham-placebo-controlled trial test hypotheses turbinate reduction : 1. increase nasal airway cross-sectional area ; 2. increase mean nightly objective CPAP use ; 3. improves sleep apnea quality life 3 month CPAP titration . We use radiofrequency turbinate reduction surgical technique , allow ethical randomization effective blinding . Three , six , 12 month turbinate reduction CPAP titration measure change minimal nasal cross-sectional area , level CPAP use , improvement sleep apnea quality life . Secondary outcome capture treatment 's broad impact nose , CPAP , sleep apnea . If turbinate reduction show improve sleep apnea outcome increase use efficacy CPAP therapy , trial demonstrate value effectiveness novel , multidisciplinary , combine medical-surgical approach management obstructive sleep apnea syndrome .</detailed_description>
