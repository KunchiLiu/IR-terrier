	<detailed_description>Study hypothesis : Questionnaire response perceive barrier implementation diabetes care recommendation , administer primary care provider staff , show correlate provider 's practice 's success implementing care guideline . Diabetes care U.S. consistently fail meet recommended quality standard . Barriers impede translation evidence-based guideline sustainable practice . Few study consider multiple barrier , lack evidence-based strategy choose intervention overcome barrier . This study involve comprehensive assessment practice barrier diabetes guideline adherence across primary care network . The BAT base upon framework propose Cabana , et al ( 1999 ) validate correlate provider practice adherence diabetes care guideline . A Diabetes Flow Sheet implement Network track adherence guideline assess correlate measured barrier . This organizational strategy support evidence-based approach quality initiative intervention . The BAT administer practice team member : provider , support staff , practice manager Network 25 primary care practice . Five hypothesis test : A : The BAT measure perceived barrier adherence diabetes guideline , show adequate internal consistency identifiable subscale structure . B : The BAT result inversely correlate practice provider adherence ADA guideline . C : BAT score inversely correlate use Diabetes Flow Sheet . D : The BAT score inversely correlate clinical outcome ( glycemic lipid control . ) E : Use Diabetes Flow Sheet correlate high provider practice adherence ADA guideline . The BAT would provide structure comprehensive assessment barrier . Study Crozer-Keystone PBRN real-world laboratory research translation evidence diverse practice . The Network optimally position implement study organizational strategy .</detailed_description>
