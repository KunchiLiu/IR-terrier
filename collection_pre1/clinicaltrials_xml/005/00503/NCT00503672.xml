	<brief_title>Assessment Activity Pregnancy Using Actigraph</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General finding consistently demonstrate literature activity tend decreased pregnancy pre-pregnancy level activity third trimester less first trimester . In non-pregnant patient , increase physical activity exercise associate improved mood self-esteem . Although data pregnancy limit , available study suggest inactivity associate bad mood . Regular physical activity detrimental low-risk patient fact may beneficial . Bed rest activity restriction commonly employ intervention woman variety obstetric complication preterm contraction , vaginal bleeding , fetal growth restriction . There compel data support bed rest effective therapeutic modality . There data occupational work increase risk preterm birth , study demonstrate effect.5 Furthermore , prolong bedrest detrimental effect muscle weakness increase thromboembolic risk , well negatively impact familial relation . The use accelerometer attempt objectively quantify physical activity pregnancy . The accelerometer assess activity measuring voltage , thus provide information intensity activity . An additional advantage worn wrist ankle , whereas pedometer need worn waist maximal accuracy limit use pregnant woman . This novel study would contribute exist literature pregnancy activity consist primarily survey/subjective data determine correlation , , exist activity pregnancy outcome . Secondarily , study survey participant see corroborate previous study demonstrate relationship activity level patient ' mood .</detailed_description>
