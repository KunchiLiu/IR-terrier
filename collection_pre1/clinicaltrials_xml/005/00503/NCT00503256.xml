	<brief_summary>The goal research identify gene may relate risk develop CLL . Objectives : The objective study investigate possible candidate susceptibility gene familial chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) identify recruit high-risk family . Through ongoing study familial aggregation CLL kindred ( protocol 2003-0498 'Genetic Study Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ' ) , identify CLL patient one live dead relative ( ) affect CLL leukemias lymphoma . We also identify patient high-risk family referral leukemia clinician self-referrals patient learn study ClinicalTrials.gov website . We plan invite probands ( patient diagnose CLL ) family member leukemias lymphomas sample unaffected relative participate genetic/linkage study . We obtain demographic clinical information along specimen ( blood buccal sample ) participant . These family part Genetic Epidemiology CLL Consortium , multicenter , multidisciplinary consortium , base Mayo Clinic Cancer Center direction Susan Slager , PhD . This fund NCI subcontract Mayo Clinic . Genotypic data analyze Mayo Clinic , cod , de-identified data share NIH Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWAS ) data repository .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study involve take medication . You ask provide study personnel authorization request medical record physician , hospital , and/or health care facility diagnose cancer . The information gather use help verify diagnosis . Study personnel may also need contact future phone , mail , e-mail order ask question status health . For research study , ask around 4 tablespoon blood drawn vein arm also ask provide sample cheek cell spit collection container . The blood cheek cell sample use special test look gene may play role development CLL . You also ask complete family history questionnaire risk factor questionnaire . The family history questionnaire risk factor questionnaire take 60 minute complete . You need contact family member send complete family history questionnaire back study staff . You must ask permission send study staff contact information . Family member CLL leukemias lymphoma , well sample unaffected family member , contact study personnel participate study . If live Houston , surround area , study personnel arrange collect sample time place convenience . If live Houston area , sample collection instruction supply mail . The blood sample may draw doctor 's office , clinic hospital choice . All mailing cost pay study . No travel M. D. Anderson require . All blood cheek cell collect used researcher involve study . Genetic information analysis blood cheek cell include repository genetic information National Institutes Health , personal identifying information sent . All information keep confidential . Neither doctor receive result test NOT put medical record . This investigational study . Up 450 participant enrol M. D. Anderson researcher . A total 4000 participant enrol multicenter study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients histologically confirm CLL live dead relative affect CLL . They must agree complete risk factor questionnaire family history questionnaire , donate 50mL blood specimen buccal specimen . 2 . Relatives CLL patient CLL lymphoproliferative disorder ( i.e. , leukemia &amp; lymphoma ) . They must agree complete risk factor questionnaire donate 50mL blood specimen buccal specimen . They need sign authorization release medical record confirm diagnosis . 3 . A sample unaffected relative CLL patient . They must agree complete risk factor questionnaire donate 50mL blood specimen buccal specimen . 1 ) No exclusion criterion</criteria>
