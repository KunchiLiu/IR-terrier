	<brief_summary>This single arm study evaluate safety efficacy MabThera participant active rheumatoid arthritis inadequate response prior treatment DMARDs and/or anti-TNF alpha agent . Participants treat MabThera 1000 milligram ( mg ) intravenously ( IV ) day 1 15 . Participants follow every 8 week complete 24 week follow-up . After completion Week 24 visit , participant follow every 3 month 18 month overall study duration 24 month ( 104 week ) . After week 36 , eligible participant achieve moderate good response accord European League Against Rheumatism ( EULAR ) response criterion receive re-treatment MabThera . Participants receive concomitant treatment DMARDs , corticosteroid , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) analgesic throughout study period . The anticipated time study treatment 2 year , target sample size 200 participant .</brief_summary>
