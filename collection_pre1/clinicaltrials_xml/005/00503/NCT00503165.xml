	<detailed_description>Menitorix combine Hib conjugate meningococcal C conjugate vaccine make GlaxoSmithKline . It currently license recommend booster vaccination UK child second year life . It important staff potential occupational exposure infectious disease afford protection possible [ HPA Occupational Health Policy [ Appendix 1 ] ; HSE Safe work prevention infection clinical laboratory similar facility , 2003 ] . The licensure availability Menitorix provide opportunity vaccinate staff . Immune responses indicative protection establish Hib meningococcal C disease [ Andrews et al. , 2003 ; Kayhty et al. , 1983 ] . It therefore propose immune response laboratory staff take part measure data currently available follow Menitorix vaccination naïve child adult [ Tejedor et al. , 2006a b ; Carmona et al. , 2006 ; Habermehl et al. , 2006 ; Pace et al. , 2006 ] . This study also allow u provide occupational healthcare laboratory worker . Laboratory staff Manchester receive Hib vaccine although received number meningococcal vaccine majority receive meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine 1999 . Certain staff would receive bivalent meningococcal A C prior conjugate vaccine recently demonstrate hind induction immunological memory conjugate vaccine [ Vu et al. , 2006 ] . Following conjugate vaccine many staff since receive quadrivalent A/C/Y/W135 polysaccharide vaccine follow seven year , little known duration protection age group . Receiving polysaccharide vaccine follow conjugate induce elevate antibody response know polysaccharide vaccination generate memory B cell result loss ability mount subsequent memory antibody response , observe MacLennan et al . Neisseria meningitidis group C anticapsular antibody response [ MacLennan et al. , 2001 ] . The clinical importance loss immunological memory induction antibody hyporesponsiveness , unknown . However , addition dampen antibody response subsequent immunisation , delay impair serum antibody response upon encounter encapsulate pathogen could theoretically increase susceptibility develop disease . Such mechanism may explain high rate otitis medium observed administration 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine Dutch child prim 7-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide protein conjugate vaccine compare rate control give hepatitis B vaccine ( P=0.0001 ) [ Veenhoven et al. , 2003 ] . In contrast , six month conjugate vaccination booster trend favor few episode otitis pneumococcal-vaccinated group . It appear staff benefit Hib serogroup C conjugate vaccination . Assessments study : Participation study would offer staff consider occupational health risk Hib meningococcal C disease Manchester HPA site . The maximum number participant would therefore 30 . This single group study everyone enrol receive single dose Menitorix blood collect prior 4-6 week follow vaccination . Local anaesthetic cream offer minimise discomfort blood test fully trained staff carry procedure . Assessment whether protective level antibody achieve make use blood sample take 4-6 week vaccination . Extra dose ( ) offer subject whose level consider confer protection describe later protocol . Subjects receive extra vaccination offer blood test 4-6 week later allow antibody level check . Samples send collaborate laboratory National Vaccine Evaluation Consortium assessment response vaccination .</detailed_description>
