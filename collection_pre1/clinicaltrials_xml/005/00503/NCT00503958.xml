	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Environmental exposure genetic predisposition may affect risk develop cancer later life . Learning genetic marker long-term effect environmental exposure may help study lung cancer future . PURPOSE : This research study look risk factor genetic marker healthy participant patient lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liverpool Lung Project : Risk Factors Genetic Markers Healthy Participants Patients With Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To prepare molecular genetic epidemiological risk assessment model base analysis environmental exposure genetic predisposition , provide algorithm measure individual 's risk develop lung cancer . - To develop archive specimen relate at-risk individual lung cancer . - To redefine lung cancer base molecular pathology use field expression methylation profiling , genetic instability . - To identify assess novel marker pre-carcinogenesis high-risk population . - To facilitate development new intervention strategy ( i.e. , chemoprevention ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Participants and/or patient undergo tumor tissue , sputum , blood sample collection periodically . Samples analyze via field expression methylation profile genetic instability . Samples also archive . Complete lifetime lifestyle , residential , environmental tobacco smoke , occupational history assess first year year five year ten . Participants return follow-up complete shorter questionnaire aim record change interval since last attendance . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : 800 patient 7,500 healthy participant accrue study .</detailed_description>
