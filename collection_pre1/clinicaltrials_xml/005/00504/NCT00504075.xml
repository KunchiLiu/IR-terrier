	<brief_title>A Study Find How Safe Effective GAMMAPLEX® Subjects With Chronic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ( ITP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective determine BPL 's GAMMAPLEX raise platelet count subject chronic ITP threshold 50 x 109/L , similar publish response &gt; 60 % . The secondary objective : 1 ) determine safety GAMMAPLEX dosage use study . 2 ) determine GAMMAPLEX maintain platelet count ³ 50 x 109/L subject chronic ITP period time similar publish data .</detailed_description>
