A history least three ART cycle result transfer least two apparently healthy embryos evidence implantation menstruation and/or beta hCG &lt; 10 IU/L end cycle ) 4 . Had regular ovulatory spontaneous menstrual cycle last 25 35 day 5 . Had FSH assessment ( early follicular day 2 5 ) within past six month &lt; 12 IU/L 6 . No diagnosed cause previous ART failure recurrent implantation failure 7 . A body mass index ( BMI ) ³ 20 £ 30 kg/m2 , calculate accord follow formula : BMI ( kg/m2 ) = Body Weight ( kg ) / Height * Height ( m2 ) 8 . The presence ovaries 9 . A uterine cavity without abnormality , investigator 's opinion , could impair embryo implantation pregnancy outcome , assess ultrasound ( US ) examination perform within six month prior begin GnRHagonist therapy 10 . Normal cervical cytology within three year prior begin GnRH agonist therapy . 11 . At least one washout cycle ( define ³ 30 day since last dose clomiphene citrate gonadotrophin treatment ) since last ART cycle and/or clomiphene citrate gonadotrophin treatment , prior begin GnRHagonist therapy 12 . Male partner semen analysis within six month prior start GnRH agonist therapy 13 . Had negative pregnancy test ( urinary ) within seven day commence GnRHagonist therapy . 14 . Willingness ability comply protocol duration study 15 . Written informed consent give prior study related procedure part patient 's normal medical care , understand consent may withdraw patient time without prejudice future medical care . 1 . Known positive Human Immunodeficiency Virus 2 . Known positive Hepatitis B C Virus 3 . Known allergy E. coli derive pharmaceutical product 4 . Any clinically significant systemic disease ( e.g . insulindependant diabetes mellitus , epilepsy , severe migraine , intermittent porphyria , hepatic , renal cardiovascular disease , severe corticosteroiddependent asthma ) significant allergic disease ( exclude rhinitis , hay fever sinusitis ENT origin ) 5 . Presence uncontrolled clinically significant medical condition ( include infection ) determine investigator 6 . Persistent tachycardia define heart rate &gt; 90 bpm confirm ECG 7 . Any medical condition , judgement investigator may interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion drug . In case doubt , patient question discuss Serono 's Study Director 8 . More one previous fail ART cycle , `` fail '' define cancellation administration hCG due poor response gonadotrophin stimulation ( define retrieval three oocytes less ) 9 . Any history difficulty ET procedure ( i.e . require general anaesthetic e.g . due position cervix ) 10 . Hyperprolactinaemia , define prolactin level ³ 1000 mIU/L and/or patient remain anovulatory despite appropriate dopamine agonist treatment 11 . Abnormal undiagnosed gynaecological bleeding 12 .
