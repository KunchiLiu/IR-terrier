	<detailed_description>Centromere-associated protein E ( CENP-E ) protein require correct chromosomal alignment mitosis . Loss CENP-E activity , due microinjection antibody , ablation gene expression siRNA antisense oligonucleotides , inhibition enzymatic activity small molecule inhibitor , cause aberrant cell cycle arrest mitosis , characterize bipolar mitotic spindle misalign chromosome . Studies small molecule inhibitor demonstrate aberrant cell cycle arrest result apoptosis cell death . CENP-E show abundantly express variety human tumor . GSK923295 potent selective CENP-E inhibitor demonstrate potent broad spectrum antitumor activity solid hematologic malignancy vitro . GSK923295 intend use either monotherapy combination exist anti-cancer therapy . A drug target CENP-E may prove efficacious taxanes vinca alkaloid , without potential neurotoxicity side-effects associate interference tubulin function non-dividing cell . Similar many anti-proliferative drug , CENP-E inhibitor expect manageable dose-limiting toxicity result action normal proliferating tissue ( e.g. , myelosuppression gastrointestinal epithelial cell damage ) . The opportunity inhibitor CENP-E lie potential broad efficacy . The absence broad clinical experience anti-mitotic cancer therapy act target tubulin complicates prediction additional benefit , beyond lack neurotoxicity might accrue drug target CENPE . The purpose Phase I , first time human ( FTIH ) study subject refractory cancer determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) ( recommend dose base available safety , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) response data ) , dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) , PK , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) , preliminary clinical activity GSK923295 , inhibitor CENP-E . The primary objective Stage 1 ( Dose Escalation ) : • To determine MTD ( recommend dose base available safety , PK , response data ) , DLTs , safety , PK GSK923295 administer subject advance , refractory malignancy . The primary objective Stage 2 ( Expansion Cohort ) : • To evaluate safety PK GSK923295 MTD ( recommend dose base available safety , PK , response data ) administer subject advance , refractory malignancy . Secondary Objectives study : - To determine clinical activity GSK923295 administer subject advance , refractory malignancy . - To evaluate effect GSK923295 biomarkers normal host tissue ( Stage 1 2 ) tumor ( Stage 2 , optional Stage 1 ) effect GSK923295 tumor metabolism FDG-PET imaging ( Stage 2 , optional Stage 1 ) . - Explore association biochemical genetic characteristic baseline archival tumor specimen ( Stage 1 Stage 2 ) , biopsy-accessible tumor specimen ( Stage 2 ) , anti-tumor response . - Explore pharmacogenomic association genetic variant drug metabolize drug transport gene PK , safety , efficacy GSK923295 . The primary secondary endpoint ( ) use assess objective measure : Primary • Adverse event ( AE ) change baseline vital sign , clinical laboratory parameter , electrocardiography ( ECG ) assessment evaluate assess safety profile . Secondary - The MTD ( recommend dose base available safety , PK , response data ) 1 6 subject DLT first treatment cycle . - PK parameter CL , Vdss , AUC ( 0-∞ ) , AUC ( 0-t ) , Cmax , tmax , t1/2 ( Stage 1 ) develop PK model GSK923295 ( Stage 1 2 ) . - Anti-tumor activity measurement obtain baseline every second cycle accord follow : - Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) Guidelines solid tumor ( solid tumor non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ) . - National Cancer Institute - Working Group ( NCI-WG ) Guidelines chronic lymphocytic leukaemia . - Exploratory PK/PD model safety response data . - Changes biomarkers cell proliferation cell death image endpoint . - Biomarker profile archival tumor specimen correlation clinical activity . - Genetic polymorphism key enzyme involve metabolism disposition GSK923295 correlation pharmacokinetic , safety , response ( pharmacodynamic ) data . The study consist two stage . Stage 1 consist dose escalation stage determine MTD ( recommend dose base available safety , PK response data ) use accelerate titration scheme combine standard dose escalation method . GSK923295 administer intravenously one hour , weekly 3 consecutive week ( i.e. , Day 1 , 8 , 15 ) treatment cycle repeat every 4 week ( cycle = 28 day ) . During Stage 1 , safety , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , clinical activity assess . Tumor biopsies PET image optional Stage 1 subject . The MTD ( recommend dose base available safety , PK response data ) define dose GSK923295 1 6 subject experience DLT first treatment cycle . Eighteen subject anticipate participate Stage 1 study . In Stage 2 , 15-20 additional subject enrol MTD ( recommend dose base available safety , PK response data ) dose evaluate safety GSK923295 . In Stage 2 , PK sample ( use sparse PK sample scheme population PK analyse ) , PET imaging , tumor biopsy obtain . Clinical activity assess . Subjects ( Stage 1 Stage 2 ) remain study meet criterion treatment discontinuation describe protocol . It anticipate 33-38 subject participate study ( 18 Stage 1 15-20 Stage 2 . During Stage 1 Stage 2 , subject histologically confirm advanced refractory solid tumor enrol . In Stage 2 , subject refractory non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia also enrol .</detailed_description>
