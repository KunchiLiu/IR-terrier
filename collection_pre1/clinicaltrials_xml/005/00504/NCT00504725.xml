	<brief_summary>The primary aim study demonstrate reduction circulate interleukin 6 level 4 24 hour completion lobectomy ( either VATS open ) . The null hypothesis ( H0 ) thus difference circulate interleukin 6 level patient give either ketamine placebo ( 0.9 % saline equivalent volume ) . The alternative ( two tail ) hypothesis ( HA ) null disprove ketamine lead significantly different level interleukin 6 4 24 hour completion surgery . We plan randomize 40 patient receive either ketamine placebo , block 4 randomization design stratify whether surgery perform VATS open lobectomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design phase 2 ( efficacy ) randomize controlled clinical trial ketamine versus placebo 40 patient undergoing lobectomy VATS open approach , Duke University . We select single dose regimen 0.5mg/kg IV ketamine give induction anesthesia , dose previously show induce maximal suppression IL-6 response cardiac surgery . We plan randomize 40 patient receive either ketamine placebo , block 4 randomization design stratify whether surgery perform VATS open lobectomy . 40 patient ( n=20 per group ) provide 90 % power detect change IL 6 20 pg/ml mean 100 pg/ml 4 hour , two tail alpha = 0.05 . Allowing 10-20 % attrition enroll 50 patient achieve sample size . All patient present lobectomy either VATS open include . Patients screen review preoperative surgical schedule post day approach consent participate exclusion criterion . Patients randomize undergo lobectomy reason include analysis primary endpoint . Patients listed VATS resection convert open include analysis per protocol basis . The randomization stratify accord plan approach ( VATS v open ) , however expect majority case VATS lobectomy . Treatment intravenous administration single dose study drug 5 minute immediately induction anesthesia surgical incision . Patients randomize ( seal envelope ) block 4 receive ketamine placebo . The randomization stratify accord whether plan surgery via VATS open ( thoracotomy ) approach . The study drug prepare investigational pharmacy provide attend anesthesiologist record case . It contain 0.5 mg/kg ketamine injection IV bolus 5 minute , equivalent volume 0.9 % saline . It responsibility principal investigator ensure study drug administer timely fashion , usually delegation attend anesthesiologist record case . The anesthetic procedure standardize patient receive total intravenous anesthetic use propofol intravenous opioid infusion . This anesthetic supplement epidural intravenous opioid bolus need control pain . Visits research team perform follow : 1 . Visit 1 occur enrollment , baseline information ( see CRF visit 1 ) collect study consent form sign . 2 . Visit 2 occur induction anesthesia study drug administer baseline blood sample 10ml collect patient 's arterial line . The blood sample immediately centrifuge serum frozen store subsequent analysis . 3 . Visit 3 occur 4 hour completion surgery 10 ml blood collect CRF visit 3 form complete ( VAS score emergence delirium ) . 4 . Visit 4 occur 24 hour completion surgery 10 ml blood collect CRF visit 4 form complete ( VAS score ) . 5 . The final visit occur prior hospital discharge CRF visit 5 form complete ( secondary endpoint ) . Additionally , principal investigator inform either study staff clinical team adverse event complication , patient visit within 24 hour confirmation event ascertainment whether event relate study drug . An SAE form complete sent IRB line institutional policy .</detailed_description>
