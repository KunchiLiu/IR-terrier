	<brief_summary>Objectives The primary objective study : • determine complete partial response rate toxicity profile bortezomib ( VELCADE , formerly PS-341 ) administer combination DICE chemotherapy plus rituximab ( i.e . VIPER ) patient relapse refractory diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma The secondary objective study : - ass event free survival overall survival - assess conversion chemo-resistant chemo-sensitive disease - ass ability collect stem cell patient treated salvage VIPER undergo autologous stem cell transplantation - perform correlative study pre-treatment tumor biopsy specimens ; analysis include assessment immunohistochemical expression pattern ( germinal center B cell vs. activate B cell ) NF-κB activity</brief_summary>
