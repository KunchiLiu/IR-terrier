	<brief_summary>This study randomize , double-blinded assessment biologic efficacy AdcuCD40L . The individual enrol study individual biopsy proven resectable esophageal carcinoma . The dose AdcuCD40L vector ( administer endoscopically directly tumor ) high tolerable dose ( likely 10^11 particle unit ) determine Weill-IRB protocol # 0011004683 dose escalation study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design add safety profile data well assess biologic efficacy parameter . It include 24 individual biopsy proven , resectable , stage I-III esophageal cancer . Because may immune response attributable gene therapy vector , independent CD40L transgene , part study design randomize , blind fashion compare intratumoral administration AdcuCD40L vector compare placebo . Because likely difference time pattern biologic response expression CD40L tumor ( include activation trafficking DC , recruitment activation immune cell ) , study include 2 `` time '' cohort ( base time administration AdcuCD40L vector time surgery remove tumor ) . Using Weill-IRB protocol # 0011004683 dose escalation study determine high non-toxic dose AdcuCD40L vector , dose ( likely 10^11 particle unit ) use individual enrol efficacy study . The placebo salt water-sugar solution use vehicle vector . Since evidence delay surgery solid tumor 15 day follow diagnosis alters prognosis , surgery removal primary tumor carry either 5 15 day administration vector ( n= 12/group , include n=6 receive AdcuCD40L vector , n=6 receive placebo ) . This permit assessment result data ( randomize , blinded fashion ) biologic response AdCUCD40L vector time . In addition safety/toxicity parameter , primary tumor , regional distant node remove time surgery , peripheral blood assess biologic parameter relevant response AdcuCD40L vector .</detailed_description>
