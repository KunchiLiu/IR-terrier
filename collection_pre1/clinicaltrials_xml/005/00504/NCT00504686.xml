	<brief_title>Patients With Neck Pain Likely Benefit From Thoracic Spine Thrust Mobilization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Recently clinical prediction rule ( CPR ) develop identifies patient neck pain likely respond rapidly dramatically thoracic spine thrust manipulation active range motion exercise . Although initial predictor variable identify development thoracic spine manipulation CPR seem adequate face validity , guarantee factor persist different group patient , even one similar characteristic use initial exploratory study . Purpose : The purpose follow-up study patient randomly assign receive thoracic spine thrust manipulation follow therapeutic exercise therapeutic exercise alone investigate validity previously develop CPR . If CPR indeed meaningful , patient positive CPR receive thoracic spine thrust manipulation experience improve outcome compare patient negative CPR receive thoracic spine manipulation , compare patient positive CPR receive intervention believe effective another subgroup patient neck pain . Design : We conduct multi-center randomized clinical trial ass effectiveness previously-developed CPR identifying patient neck pain likely respond thoracic spine thrust manipulation . Subjects age 18 60 primary report neck pain randomize receive manipulation plus exercise program receive exercise program . Methods : One hundred forty patient primary complaint neck pain meet inclusion/exclusion criterion consent participate enrol study . We base sample size calculation detect statistically significant difference 4 cell study include patient status rule ( patient meet CPR patient meet CPR ) treatment group ( manipulation exercise ) use 1-week Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) score alpha-level 0.05 . To detect 10 point change NDI , expect standard deviation 12 point 1 week follow ( effect size 0.80 ) 90 % power use two-tailed hypothesis assume 50 % distribution patient meet rule , 31 patient per cell require . We recruit 140 subject study control drop-outs prior 1 4 week follow-up possible distribution discrepancy classification . The primary outcome point four-weeks randomization , change disability measure NDI , serve primary outcome measure . Data Analysis : We examine primary aim 3-way repeated-measures analysis variance ( ANOVA ) treatment group ( manipulation vs. exercise ) status rule ( positive negative ) subject independent variable time ( baseline , 1 week 4 week ) within-subjects independent variable . The dependent variable disability ( NDI score ) . The hypothesis interest 3-way group * CPR status * time interaction . We perform plan pairwise comparison follow-up period use Bonferroni inequality . Significance : The result study improve clinical decision-making outcome physical therapy intervention assist clinician ability select appropriate manual physical therapy technique patient neck pain . Validation CPR would enhance certainty therapist able identify patient neck pain likely exhibit dramatic response thoracic spine thrust manipulation measure reduced level disability ) therapeutic exercise . Results study impact future patient neck pain provide method classification base clinical presentation therapist determine likelihood respond thoracic spine thrust manipulation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The following inclusion criterion use determine eligibility study : 1 . Primary complaint neck pain without unilateral upper extremity symptom 2 . Age 1860 year old 3 . NDI score great 10 point The following exclusion criterion use determine ineligibility study : 1 . Red flag note patient 's Neck Medical Screening Questionnaire ( i.e . tumor , fracture , metabolic disease , RA , osteoporosis , prolonged history steroid use , etc . ) 2 . History whiplash injury within past six week 3 . Diagnosis cervical spinal stenosis bilateral upper extremity symptom 4 . Evidence central nervous system involvement , include hyperreflexia , sensory disturbance hand , intrinsic muscle waste hand , unsteadiness walking , nystagmus , loss visual acuity , impaired sensation face , alter taste , presence pathological reflex ( i.e . positive Hoffman 's and/or Babinski reflex ) , etc . 5 . Two positive neurologic sign consistent nerve root compression , include two following : 6 . Muscle weakness involve major muscle group upper extremity 7 . Diminished upper extremity muscle stretch reflex ( biceps brachii , brachioradialis , triceps reflex ) 8 . Diminished absent sensation pinprick upper extremity dermatome</criteria>
