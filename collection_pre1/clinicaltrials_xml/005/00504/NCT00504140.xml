	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To determine efficacy combine Interferon Alpha ( IFN ) etoposide treatment relapse osteosarcoma . 2 . To determine IFN alters plasma pharmacokinetics etoposide . 3 . To determine toxicity IFN etoposide administer together . 4 . To determine IFN blood level follow combination therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recombinant Interferon Alpha Etoposide Relapsed Osteosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interferon Alpha ( IFN ) - give shot skin . One hour later , VP-16 infuse catheter ( tube ) place vein 3 hour . The drug give daily 5 day . The treatment repeat every 3 - 4 week 24 - 32 week ( 8 course ) . The catheter remain place throughout treatment . Patients candidate surgery first receive two course treatment . If tumor get bad severe side effect occur , treatment stop , tumor remove right away . If tumor respond well ( begin shrink get bad ) severe side effect occur , patient receive six course treatment surgery . Patients candidate surgery receive two initial course treatment . If tumor respond well severe side effect occur , patient receive six course treatment . The treatment give outpatient department . Before treatment begin , patient health examination . Blood test , urine test , heart test give . X-rays , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , bone scan do . The location size lesion record . During treatment , patient blood test every week . Before course , health examination , urine test , chest x-ray give size measurable cancer record . After second course , CT bone scan repeat . All test repeat end study . About 37 patient treat study M. D. Anderson . THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY . IFN- VP-16 approve U.S. Food Drug Administration treat type cancer . Their use together osteosarcoma investigational .</detailed_description>
