	<brief_title>Ranibizumab Treat Type 2 Idiopathic Macular Telangiectasia ( RAMA-Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 idiopathic macular telangiectasia ( type 2 IMT ) retinal disease unknown etiology commonly present slow decrease visual acuity , read difficulty metamorphopsia fifth seventh decade . Diagnosis base fluorescein angiography typically reveal parafoveal leakage late phase may show telangiectatic capillary early phase . In subset patient , proliferative stage secondary neovascularizations may develop late disease course . In past , effective treatment disease stage without neovascularization . Recent study limit number patient nonproliferative disease show promising result intravitreal injection bevacizumab , antagonist target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . Bevacizumab result decrease parafoveal leakage fluorescein angiography decrease retinal thickness . An increase visual acuity report subset patient . The RAMA-Trial initiated order investigate effect ranibizumab . The safety tolerability VEGF-antagonist extensively study large cohort patient suffer age-related macular degeneration . Patients type 2 IMT receive monthly injection period one year . The mentioned outcome measure assess .</detailed_description>
