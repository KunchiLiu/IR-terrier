	<brief_summary>Previous experience antibody therapy NHL CLL warrant exploration new antibody treatment diseases . Immunomedics develop hLL1 ( previously designate EPB-1 ) , CDR-grafted , fully humanize monoclonal antibody specifically target CD74.38 The human IgG1 backbone hLL1 hLL2 ( epratuzumab ) , monoclonal antibody whose safety demonstrate clinical trial patient B-cell malignancy autoimmune disorder . This Phase I , open-label , study conduct patient recurrent non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) progress least one prior standard treatment . All patient receive hLL1 administer intravenously daily Monday Friday 2 consecutive week ( 10 total dos . ) Patients assigned cohort hLL1 treatment dose assignment ( escalate dos hLL1 per statistical plan ) order determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) administration schedule .</brief_summary>
