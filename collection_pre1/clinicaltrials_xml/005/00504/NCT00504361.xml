	<brief_summary>This research study researcher collect blood evaluate genetic characteristic individual chronic lung disease , include asthma , COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) , interstitial lung disease , cystic fibrosis , lung cancer . The investigator hope able identify association genetic make-up blood sample risk develop particular lung disease , severity lung disease . The finding study might important develop future preventative method potential treatment management lung disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Collection From Individuals With Lung Disease Genetic Studies ( Qatar )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol design collect small amount blood extraction DNA ( genetic material ) study genetic basis lung disease . The study population include individual know lung diseases control without lung disease . Individuals study population individual Hamad Medical Corporation , Qatar ( HMC ) , well individual recruit study . In protocol , researcher survey medical record patient chronic lung disease , order study clinical characteristic individual , researcher collect blood evaluate genetic characteristic individual chronic lung disease include asthma , COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) , pulmonary fibrosis , lung cancer . The researcher also collect blood sample individual without lung disease serve control . This protocol , carry Weill Cornell Medical College - Qatar Hamad Medical Corporation , Qatar , parallel similar approve protocol IRB # 0508008095 , entitle , `` Collection Blood Gene Expression/Genomic Studies Individuals Chronic Lung Diseases '' , ongoing Weill Cornell Medical College - New York .</detailed_description>
