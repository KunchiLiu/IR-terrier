	<brief_title>Dasatinib Treating Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression-free survival patient metastatic colorectal cancer progress follow two prior chemotherapy regimen treat dasatinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient treat dasatinib . II . Determine overall survival patient treat dasatinib . III . Determine toxicity patient treat dasatinib . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine incidence somatic mutation c-src , c-yes , fyn , lck , hck , lyn , yrk csk archival primary metastatic colorectal cancer tissue patient correlate clinical outcome . II . Determine incidence total c-src phosphorylated c-src expression archival primary metastatic colorectal cancer specimens patient , correlate clinical outcome . III . Evaluate effect dasatinib serum VEGF level . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood collect day 1 ( prior first dose dasatinib ) 15 course 1 measurement VEGF pre-and post-dasatinib administration . Archived tumor tissue ( tumor core biopsy ; primary metastatic lesion ) collect identification incidence somatic mutation polymorphisms polymerase chain reaction electrophoresis measurement total c-src phosphorylated src expression immunohistochemistry . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 8 week .</detailed_description>
