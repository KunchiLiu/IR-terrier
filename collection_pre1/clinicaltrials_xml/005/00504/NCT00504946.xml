	<detailed_description>There mount evidence successful allergen immunotherapy ( SIT ) function induction different subset Treg include Foxp3 positive cell , therefore additional strategy enhance property highly attractive . Since corticosteroid directly induce development IL-10-synthesizing regulatory T-cell population ( Tr1 ) effect greatly increase vitamin D3 treatment , assume combine allergen immunotherapy non-specific treatment glucocorticosteroids vitamin D3 well montelukast sodium treatment might enhance allergen tolerance induction improve clinical effectiveness allergen-specific immunotherapy , therefore conduct stud compare effect glucocorticosteroid , glucocorticosteroid vitamin D3 montelukast sodium early immunological clinical effect allergen-specific immunotherapy asthmatic child .</detailed_description>
