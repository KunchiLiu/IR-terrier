	<brief_title>SB939 Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine recommended phase II dose oral SB939 patient solid tumor . Secondary - To determine toxic effect SB939 association dose pharmacokinetics . - To assess pharmacokinetic profile SB939 . - To assess preliminary evidence antitumor effect SB939 patient measurable disease document objective response . - To establish proof-of-principle SB939 effect histone acetylation evaluation histone acetylation biomarkers peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) dose level . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral SB939 daily day 1-5 15-19 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically course 1 pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study . Samples analyzed level SB939 via LC-MS/MS method level acetylate histone 3 ( AcH3 ) , target effect , downstream consequence , tumor response via western blot , immunohistochemistry , ELISA method . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
