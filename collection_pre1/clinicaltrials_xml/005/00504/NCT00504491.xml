	<brief_summary>Since standard rescue therapy refractory CLL relapse purine analogous , target carry rescue therapy combine several chemotherapy agent ( CHOP ) add synergistic effect Rituximab order act tumour-like CLL form , assessable size lymph node . Afterwards , base study , shall study role Alemtuzumab drug consolidation improvement response obtain initial therapy ( CHOP-R ) , act `` cleaning '' peripheral blood bone marrow CLL lymphocytes may remain residual chemotherapy induction therapy . More precisely , addition Alemtuzumab maintenance treatment would increase complete response negative residual disease number may prolong duration response . For , necessary adequate rigorous clinical follow-up also biological , i.e . able analyze minimal residual disease molecular biology technique . This reason write phase II clinical trial protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>R-CHOP Alemtuzumab Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES The objective clinical trial following : - Main objective study : Overall response rate obtain R-CHOP regime follow Alemtuzumab consolidation second line therapy - Secondary objective - Determine molecular complete response rate R-CHOP regimen - Determine efficacy Alemtuzumab response improvement R-CHOP regimen : conversion PR CR MRD+ MRD- . - Applicability ( toxicity profile ) Alemtuzumab consolidation therapy . - As additional objective consider : 1 . Prognostic value several biological variable ( ZAP-70 cytogenetics ) influence response 2 . Response duration 3 . Progression free survival 4 . Overall survival</detailed_description>
