	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine extent CYP2B6 , CYP3A4 , MDR1 polymorphisms affect metabolism methadone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role CYP2B6 , CYP3A4 , MDR1 Metabolic Clearance Methadone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methadone maintenance treatment ( MMT ) use rehabilitate opiate addict result high quality life patient well improve social psychological functioning reduce overall cost society . The maintenance dose methadone highly variable patient , drug-drug interaction observe methadone various medication use treat variety disease . Identification understand enzymes responsible metabolism methadone could potentially lead improved strategy individualize methadone dose reduce risk adverse drug interaction . Several cytochrome P450 enzyme ( CYPs ) identify hypothesize involved methadone metabolism vitro , particularly CYP2B6 CYP3A4 . However , quantitative contribution CYP2B6 CYP3A4 elimination clearance methadone vivo remain undefined . In addition , methadone substrate efflux transporter , P-glycoprotein ( Pgp ) intestinal mucosa . We propose pilot study healthy human subject investigate follow hypothesis : 1 . Pgp limit gastrointestinal absorption 2 . Inter-subject variation CYP2B6 CYP3A4 activity explain variation methadone clearance vivo This accomplish correlate pharmacokinetics methadone phenotype probe Pgp ( digoxin ) , CYP2B6 ( bupropion ) CYP3A4 ( midazolam ) . We plan use data design human subject study assess utility MDR1 CYP genotyping predict methadone maintenance dose cohort MMT patient .</detailed_description>
