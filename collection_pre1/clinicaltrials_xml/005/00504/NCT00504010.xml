Handrails provide safety comfort - He perform heel lift rise stair use foot stair , hold 2 second , maximally dorsiflexes foot count 2 second . A metronome set generate tone every 2 second guides pace . - This repeat 25 time , subject unable complete full cycle . - He perform sequence use leg . - A second set 20 repetition perform leg , follow final 15 repetition . - The gel apply immediately exercise lower leg . Subjects instructed wash leg least one hour application . - The pain score complete leg 24 hour later , gel apply leg . Again , subject instruct leave gel undisturbed least one hour . - Approximately 48 hour later subject return measurement ankle range motion , complete pain score applies gel final time . Subjects instruct leave gel legs least one hour . - To measure muscle tenderness , 1cm sphere place subject 's mid-calf , compress standardized 5 pound weight .
