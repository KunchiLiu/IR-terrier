	<brief_summary>This study determine prevalence endocrine-related side effect child treat cancer establish database registry organize accord cancer diagnosis , treatment endocrine side effect . In child , endocrine system , include gland hormone help control metabolism , growth , development reproduction , particularly vulnerable long-term side effect associate cancer treatment . The study also serve help train medical fellow , resident student identify manage endocrine abnormality child diagnose treated cancer . Children 2 24 year age treat childhood cancer disease-free least 1 year may eligible study . All participant undergo follow procedure : - Review cancer treatment record - Review medical family history - Blood draw DNA study - Physical examination body measurement ( height , weight , waist , body proportion ) - Completion child health questionnaire - Individualized screening counseling program - Review follow endocrine system : growth , pituitary hypothalamic function , thyroid function , ovary testicular function , bone health , risk obesity diabetes The following additional study may do , clinically indicate : - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain - Thyroid , testicular ovarian ultrasound - DEXA scan measure bone density - Wrist x-ray measure bone age - Blood test - Urine pregnancy test girl old enough menstrual period - Stimulation testing ( test involve give medicine mouth vein measure blood level substance afterwards , oral glucose tolerance test , arginine-clonidine growth hormone stimulation test , ACTH stimulation test , gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test ) Children endocrine abnormality offer standard treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endocrine dysfunction increasingly recognize one important aspect quality life issue , physical psychosocial development overall prognosis pediatric patient diagnose neoplasms well patient s/p bone marrow transplant throughout lifespan . In addition , several new , molecularly design therapy neoplasm may interact endocrine signal ; include receptor and/or ligands growth and/or proliferation factor , disruptors steroid hormone interaction . The present study serve natural history protocol . As natural history , protocol allow Institute care pediatric adult patient endocrine relate complication associate prior cancer therapy and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) purpose : Training fellow , resident student identification management endocrine abnormality develop patient diagnose treated neoplasm and/or receive HSCT NIH-Clinical center . Developing new clinical study recognition therapy endocrine side effect related cancer therapy and/or HSCT : protocol eventually lead new , separate protocol address specific aspects endocrinopathies childhood cancer survivor HSCT survivor . The protocol serve basis outpatient clinic function within context pediatric adult endocrine outpatient clinic : every eligible patient refer endocrine service NCI , NHLBI , NIH institution center enrol study , first time create endocrine database patient . As stated aim , hope present investigation serve incubator research-focused study ultimate goal improve life child adult cure underlying neoplasms well individual recipient HSCT .</detailed_description>
