	<brief_summary>Several method exist evaluate motor function child cerebral palsy use assess outcome clinical intervention . However , scale direct towards measure change muscle activity pattern result intervention . For example , classification scale aim measure motor function functional ability , index gait function . These score , provide way quantify function mechanic , directly measure muscle activation characteristic . Therefore , test may insensitive intervention directly affect muscle function , usually focus intervention ( i.e . botulinum toxin , functional electrical stimulation , dorsal rhizotomy ) . Muscle biopsy motor evoke potential provide information muscle activation characteristic , however , invasive concern use technique pediatric population and/or practicality clinical implementation , especially since provide insight muscle behave functional task . One method use provide insight muscle activity non-invasive clinically meaningful manner use surface electromyography ( sEMG ) . Surface EMG typically routine part clinical assessment evaluation motor impairment CP . However , analysis data limit case examination signal amplitude difference muscle onset offset timing . The long-term goal research develop analysis method sEMG use functional task treatment planning , diagnostic , assessment purpose CP . This accomplished use continuous wavelet transform ( CWT ) . By develop assessment method base muscle activity , believe clinically viable measurement tool devise provide level insight effect intervention muscle pathophysiology currently available . The first step progress towards long-term goal determine variability range expect time-frequency pattern express give population ( i.e. , cerebral palsy ) execution meaningful task ( gait ) , relate time-frequency information back standard assessment</brief_summary>
