	<brief_summary>Patients type blood cell disorder hard cure . We suggest treatment might help patient live long without disease treatment plan would . This treatment know stem cell transplant . We believe may help patient allow u give much strong dose drug radiation kill diseased cell could give without transplant . We also think healthy cell may help fight diseased cell leave transplant . Stem Cells special `` mother '' cell find bone marrow ( spongy tissue inside bone ) , although also find bloodstream ( peripheral blood ) . As grow , become either white blood cell fight infection , red blood cell carry oxygen remove waste product organs tissue platelet , enable blood clot . For transplant take place , collect stem cell `` donor '' ( person agree donate cell ) give recipient . Patients sibling perfect match , stem cell come donor best match available . This person may close relative unrelated person whose stem cell best `` match '' patient , agree donate stem cell . Before transplant , two strong drug plus total body irradiation give patient ( pre-conditioning ) . This treatment kill blood-forming cell bone marrow . We give patient healthy stem cell . Once healthy stem cell bloodstream move bone marrow ( graft ) begin produce blood cell eventually mature healthy red blood cell , white blood cell platelet . This research study also use CAMPATH-1H pre-treatment . CAMPATH-1H antibody certain type blood cell . CAMPATH-1H important stay active body long time infusion , mean may work long prevent GvHD symptom . The stem cell transplant describe consider `` standard '' treatment . We would like collect additional blood describe order evaluate immune system recover . We ask permission draw blood patient measure number certain blood cell call T regulatory cell . T regulatory cell special immune cell control regulate body 's immune response . We want determine whether T regulatory cell important participant graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , infection relapse . In GVHD , certain cell donate marrow blood ( graft ) attack body transplant patient ( host ) . GVHD affect many different part body . The skin , eye , stomach intestine affect often . GVHD range mild life-threatening . We know whether T regulatory cell modify condition . We want measure T regulatory cell learn cell influence condition . If learn T regulatory cell affect condition , may possible modify cell benefit transplant patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To participate transplant , patient need central line . Before transplant test blood virus cause problem transplant . These virus include Hepatitis B , cytomegalovirus HIV . If patient positive AIDS virus , able undertake transplant . Standard therapy : The patient give 6 dos chemotherapy drug call Ara C high dos ( every 12 hour ) begin 8 day stem cell transplant . Then , another chemotherapy drug call cyclophosphamide give high dos vein two day 7th 6th day transplant . A drug call MESNA give cyclophosphamide . MESNA use decrease side effect cause cyclophosphamide . The patient also receive antibody call Campath ( day 4 day transplant ) help destroy immune system less host resistance growth donor cell . Radiation treatment give entire body day 4 day transplant . This give 2 time day 4 day . The chemotherapy radiation treatment last 8 day . If patient diagnosis T-cell Lymphoma , give Ara-C . Extra bone marrow test may recommend physician check patient condition , especially marrow slow grow . The day radiation treatment complete ; patient receive healthy stem cell vein . Once bloodstream , stem cell go bone marrow begin grow . In prevention GvHD , patient also receive medicine call FK506 well low dose methotrexate . The FK506 give intravenously initially start 2 day transplant late mouth ( able take oral medication ) . This drug give day several week . Four dos low dose methotrexate give intravenously . The methotrexate give day transplant , 3 , 6 11 day transplant . If GVHD control FK506 , medicine may need give . The doctor describe medicine time . Blood sample research : To study cell work patient system , blood sample take month six month , nine month , one year , 2 year 3 year follow transplant . Approximately 6-8 teaspoon blood collect time . The total blood drawn study three year exceed 1 3/4 cup . This amount consider safe adult . The amount blood collect decreased child and/or patient amount blood collection would appropriate .</detailed_description>

This include patient relapsed standard chemotherapy treatment patient first remission unfavorable prognostic feature . Using standard 6 HLA antigen profile ( HLA class I , A B , HLA class II , DRB1 ) patient must either one HLA antigen mismatch related donor HLA match one antigen mismatch unrelated donor .
