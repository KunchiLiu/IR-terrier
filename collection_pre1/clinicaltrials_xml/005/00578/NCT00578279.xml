	<criteria>A total 20 consecutive subject locally advance unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( stage II IV ) pain ( abdominal and/or back ) . Subjects know suspect unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma recruit study , diagnosis unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma often make endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) procedure . Subjects must document disease compute tomography ( CT ) , endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) , EUS . Subjects undergo EUS pancreatic cancer stag . Subjects undergoing pancreatic cancer surgery eligible study entry begin 5 day operation intraoperative celiac plexus neurolysis . No evidence dementia alter mental status would prohibit give understand informed consent , evidence psychiatric risk would preclude adequate compliance protocol . Subjects must coagulopathy ( platelet &lt; 50,000 , INR &gt; 1.5 , bleed disorder , blood thinner ) Subjects platelet 50,000 eligible participate study due risk bleeding . Patients ask discontinue use nonsteroidal 5 day prior procedure . Patients plavix ask discontinue use 7 day prior procedure clinically able . Patients coumadin lovenox also need discontinue use prior procedure , decision regard management make individual basis per usual standard care . Subjects must provide sign write informed consent . A baseline pain score require , however , subject must pain require stable dose pain medication control pain . Subjects exclude undergone celiac plexus neurolysis ( endoscopic , percutaneous , surgical ) . Presence implant epidural intrathecal analgesic therapy .
