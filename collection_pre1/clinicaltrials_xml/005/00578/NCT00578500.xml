	<brief_summary>Success rate cancer treatment increase significantly result many girl young woman treat cancer survivor . Nevertheless , cancer treatment may result long term side effect . Damage ovary may result serious difficulty become pregnant future . The risk happen depends , among others upon patient 's age , disease type treatment undergoes . Medical research continuously look way preserve female fertility use less toxic protocol . Yet , keep egg outside body treatment interesting option routine boy preserve sperm cancer treatment . This research attempt freeze egg either ovarian tissue individually .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fertility Preservation Ovarian Oocyte Cryopreservation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advances early detection increase success chemotherapy make cancer therapy curable disease . In child adolescent cancer , cure rate approach 75 % . These cure rate achieve great part due use intensive chemotherapy , case , radiation . The use treatment modality associate significant toxicity , include potential gonadal damage subsequent reduce fertility . Aggressive chemotherapy , however , usually gonadotoxic result infertility many pediatric patient . Ovarian damage drug dose dependant increase patient age treatment . Increasing number young cancer survivor therefore experience infertility relate past cancer treatment . Having child thus become important issue young cancer patient . Cryopreservation sperm effective method offer pre- post-adolescent male . Female gametes however , readily amenable cryopreservation though use vitrification recently result improved result . Nevertheless , method applicable young girl require prolonged induction ovulation vaginal sonography complete aspiration oocyte . Similarly , In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) may offer patient beyond adolescence . Ovulation induction require week delay initiation cancer treatment . Since ovarian stimulation generally feasible option young girl adolescent , strategy preserve fertility patient usually include ovarian cryopreservation , experimental technology success animal study , recently result delivery follow human transplantation . Although technique remain investigational , increasingly offer woman undergo cancer treatment . In prepubertal girl ovarian cryopreservation option potentially preserve ovarian function . As others show , probable method ovarian transplantation vascular anastomosis apply future . We recently recommend follow individual consultation multi-disciplinary team , female pediatric cancer patient family counsel regard side effect chemotherapy offer ovarian preservation . The methodology ovarian cortex preservation , pioneer Gosden currently routine many center country . Nevertheless , realize future use cryopreserved ovarian cortex may limit due cellular injury cryopreservation due tissue ischemic damage follow transplantation . Furthermore , cryobanking ovarian cortex preserve smallest ( primordial primary ) follicles , since preovulatory antral follicle , contain GV stage oocytes survive procedure . We thus currently propose patient undergo ovarian cryopreservation perform integrate oocyte aspiration antral follicle tissue , follow vitro maturation ( IVM ) oocyte cryopreservation additional fertility-preserving method . The aim study analyze oocyte detection IVM success rate young girl adolescent use combined method .</detailed_description>
