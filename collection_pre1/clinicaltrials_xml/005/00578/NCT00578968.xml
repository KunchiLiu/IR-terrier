	<brief_title>Cardiac Limitations Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease : Benefits Bronchodilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) loss elastic recoil lung , remodel airway pulmonary vasculature , develop inhomogeneity ventilation ( VA ) perfusion ( Qc ) gradually lose reserve produce expiratory flow , particularly mid low lung volume . As result , develop air trap , slow expiration , gradually hyperinflate large residual volume , exaggerated total lung capacity , reduce vital capacity , markedly reduce maximal expiratory flow . With exercise , patient moderate severe COPD challenge need increase ventilation . Expiring narrowed airway result breathe high high lung volume elastic load inspiration increase work cost breathing point exercise discontinues . It remain controversial scenario lead primarily dyspnea weak heavily recruit inspiratory muscle , inspiratory muscle fatigue primary limitation might relate relatively large cardiac output require respiratory muscle , expense locomotor muscle , result leg fatigue . The expiratory load also increase intrathoracic pressure reduces gradient venous return , thus potential reduce cardiac output . Pulmonary hypertension develop may influence blood flow leave side heart inhibit cardiac output . The ineffective inspiratory pressure generation diaphragm may also reduce typical benefit respiratory muscle pump venous return mark hyperinflation may influence leave ventricular filling due competition intrathoracic space . Thus , although COPD primarily influence respiratory system , believe profound effect cardiac function , exercise may play particular limitation . Use long-acting anticholinergic agent Tiotropium partially reverse airway obstruction ( expiratory load ) hyperinflation , potentially improve cardiovascular function . The focus research determine influence Tiotropium cardiac parameter measure rest exercise . The focus study determine influence Tiotropium ( Spiriva ) cardiac parameter measure rest exercise . More specifically , first examine cardiac function group COPD patient healthy age gender match control . Our hypothesis rest cardiac function would similar group ; however , light heavy exercise , would evidence blunt stroke volume perhaps cardiac output COPD patient . Second , compare placebo-controlled double blind manner cardiac function without chronic use tiotropium age , gender , disease match COPD patient . Our hypothesis Tiotropium ( Spiriva ) group match workload , reduce obstruction would allow improved cardiac function , specifically increase stroke volume reduction heart rate . The interaction population metabolic demand , fitness , lung mechanic , cardiovascular function complicate thus study pursue matched workload heart rate well heavier exercise attempt discriminate primary influence alter obstruction cardiovascular function . The participant ask come Cardiopulmonary Research Laboratory 4 occasion ( separate visit ) exercise test ( typically course 2 4 week ) . Each session take approximately 1-4 hour complete COPD population , visit repeat receive placebo Tiotropium 4 week . All exercise test perform exercise bicycle either upright semi-supine ( recumbent ) position participant wear SCUBA-type mouthpiece nose clip analyze expire air . In addition , EKG use monitor heart rate rhythm . Visit 1 ( Screening Visit ) : During first visit , participant brief exam pulmonary physician . The exam include complete blood count ( CBC ) rule anemia , baseline spirometry ass lung volume flow rate meet entry criterion , woman childbearing potential pregnancy test . They also take theophylline inhale anticholinergic , allow continue long act inhale beta agonist ( LABA ) short act beta agonist ( SABA ) rescue medication . Subjects long act inhale beta agonist ask discontinue medication temporarily , 48 hr . prior study visit , restart upon completion visit . Visit 2 : A minimum 48 hour first visit , participant return complete measure lung volume , flow rate , diffuse capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) , baseline echocardiogram maximal exercise test cycle ergometer . Before exercise begin , participant one two small balloon ( ) ( 2 inch long , deflate ) attach small plastic tube ( width pencil tip ) insert nasal cavity esophagus . This do measure respiratory muscle work . Participants receive numb gel ( 2 % lidocaine ) numb nasal passage upper esophagus prior insertion balloon ( ) . During insertion esophageal balloon , participant also ask swallow water minimize gagging assure correct balloon placement esophagus . Participants also ask breathe mixture gas contain acetylene ( 0.6 % ) , dimethyl ether ( 1.8 % ) , oxygen ( 21 % , room air ) , helium ( 9 % ) nitrogen ( 69.4 % ) . The mixture gas inhale various time point course exercise session 8 10 breaths time . This do non-invasively measure cardiac output . Visit 3 : Visit 3 involve steady-state semi-recumbent cycling exercise two steady-state exercise intensity ; 40 percent peak work ( brief rest ) intensity elicit heart rate 110 beat per minute ( standardize diastolic duration ) . Before exercise begin , participant one two small balloon ( ) ( 2 inch long , deflate ) attach small plastic tube ( width pencil tip ) insert nasal cavity esophagus . This do measure respiratory muscle work . Participants receive numb gel ( 2 % lidocaine ) numb nasal passage upper esophagus prior insertion balloon ( ) . During insertion esophageal balloon , participant also ask swallow water minimize gagging assure correct balloon placement esophagus . Participants also ask breathe mixture gas contain acetylene ( 0.6 % ) , dimethyl ether ( 1.8 % ) , oxygen ( 21 % , room air ) , helium ( 9 % ) nitrogen ( 69.4 % ) . The mixture gas inhale various time point course exercise session 8 10 breaths time . This do non-invasively measure cardiac output . Also session , sonographer use ultrasound measure cardiac pressure volume . Visit 4 : Visit 4 involve steady-state exercise 70 % peak work . Before exercise begin , participant one two small balloon ( ) ( 2 inch long , deflate ) attach small plastic tube ( width pencil tip ) insert nasal cavity esophagus . This do measure respiratory muscle work . Participants receive numb gel ( 2 % lidocaine ) numb nasal passage upper esophagus prior insertion balloon ( ) . During insertion esophageal balloon , participant also ask swallow water minimize gagging assure correct balloon placement esophagus . Participants also ask breathe mixture gas contain acetylene ( 0.6 % ) , dimethyl ether ( 1.8 % ) oxygen ( 21 % , room air ) , helium ( 9 % ) nitrogen ( 69.4 % ) . The mixture gas inhale various time point course exercise session 8 10 breaths time . This do non-invasively measure cardiac output . Upon completion baseline visit , COPD patient randomly assign standard dose Tiotropium once-daily ( 18 Âµg ) placebo 4 week ( study completion visit 2-4 may require 1-2 wks complete ) . Patients otherwise receive usual care , except ( note ) discontinue anticholinergic bronchodilator theophylline . They also discontinue long act beta agonist 48 hour prior perform designate visit . At end intervention period , procedure outline Visits 2-4 repeat ( COPD patient ) . All post intervention visit time primary measure make 1.5 2 hr post dose Tiotropium .</detailed_description>
