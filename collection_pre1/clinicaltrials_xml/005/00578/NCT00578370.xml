	<brief_summary>Ciclosporin cyclic nonribosomal polypeptide 11 amino acid produce fungi Tolypocladium inflatum Cylindrocarpon lucidum . Ciclosporin highly efficient immunosuppressant drug widely use post-allergenic organ transplant reduce activity subject 's immune system risk organ rejection . Apart transplant medicine , ciclosporin also use treatment autoimmune disease like psoriasis infrequently rheumatoid arthritis related disease , although use severe case . Ciclosporin block lymphocyte , especially T-lymphocytes , G0- G1-phase cell cycle . Moreover inhibit production release lymphokines include interleukin 2 T-cell growth factor . Generally ciclosporin take orally ( capsule solution ) injection dose 1.5 5.5 mg/kg/day . In topical cutaneous emulsion present , ciclosporin available concentration 0.5 1.5 % . The purpose study demonstration antipsoriatic efficacy tolerability topical cutaneous ciclosporin subject psoriasis vulgaris .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Tolerability Study Topical Ciclosporin Psoriasis Plaque Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriasis common dermatological disorder , consist inflammatory hyperproliferative component . Scaly , erythematous infiltrate skin lesion indicative psoriasis vulgaris . The disease characterize micromorphologically epidermal hyperplasia incomplete differentiation , intraepidermal accumulation polymorphonuclear neutrophil , elongate papilla containing dilate , tortuous capillary lymphohistiocytic infiltrate . Since underlie cause disease remain unknown , causal therapy possible . The complex clinical picture necessitate polypragmatic therapeutic approach . Typical therapy include phototherapy photochemotherapy , topical treatment corticosteroid , vitamin D3 analog , coal-tar preparation dithranol , systemic treatment retinoids , methotrexate ciclosporin ( oral injection ) . In present study topical cutaneous ciclosporin formulation topical treatment psoriasis test low-dose efficacy tolerability . Two concentration ciclosporin formulation ( 0.5 % 1.5 % ) , correspond vehicle , market corticoid preparation market topical Vitamin-D-analog test simultaneously patient . Five test field locate torso extremity examine per subject , treat non-occlusively 22 study day period study 26 day . Experimental measurement ( sonography ) clinical assessment perform baseline study day .</detailed_description>
