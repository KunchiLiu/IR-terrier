	<brief_summary>The Genitourinary Oncology/Urology Services Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center ( MSKCC ) participate research control , treatment , cure cancer . The purpose study collect normal cancerous tissue , addition blood , body fluid sample men prostate cancer prostatic disease . These sample may store future use use immediately researcher study prostate cancer try find good way diagnose , prevent , treat . We look genetic change protein marker cell . We hope learn make people get prostate cancer , cancer aggressive others , cancer respond resist different treatment . We may also try grow tumor cell lab . We may find new treatment prostate cancer base research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The therapeutic program advanced prostate cancer base hypothesis factor contribute associated progression change disease evolve . To categorize change consider disease series state . 1 The state represent point intervention might consider prevent cancer developing , eliminate establish disease , delay progression . The state also represent clinically significant milestone use assess treatment effect .</detailed_description>
