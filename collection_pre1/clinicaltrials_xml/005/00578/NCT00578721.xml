	<brief_summary>The purpose research study understand effect oral aspirin take daily arginine-restricted diet certain colorectal cancer biomarkers treat colorectal cancer patient . Patients colorectal cancer high risk recurrence development secondary colorectal cancer future . Specific chemical ( polyamines , prostaglandin ) body refer biomarkers measure help understand person 's risk develop colorectal cancer . Specific biomarkers associated colorectal cancer identify prior laboratory study . By measure predefined biomarkers study intervention , assess affect intervention , gain knowledge usefulness colorectal cancer patient clinical trial . This study Phase IIa clinical biomarker study , use oral aspirin 325 mg take daily arginine-restricted diet design reduce arginine intake least 30 % 12-week study period . The biomarkers obtain patient perform endoscopy ( procedure use look inside bowel , rectum colon ) biopsy ( take sample tissue ) , phlebotomy ( draw blood ) , urine collection . Biopsies do evaluate change tissue content may relate early event colon cancer formation . This procedure use diagnose condition initially . There 24 patient enrol study perform University California Irvine Medical Center .</brief_summary>
