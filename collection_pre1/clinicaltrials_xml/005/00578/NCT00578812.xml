	<detailed_description>The PCM Cervical Disc study prospective , multicenter , randomize FDA-approved investigational device exemption ( IDE ) clinical trial conduct United States evaluate longitudinal outcome 2 year comparatively PCM Cervical Disc anterior cervical discectomy fusion ( ACDF ) allograft plate . Patients adjacent non-adjacent prior fusion allow . A total 416 patient degenerated cervical disc one level C3-C4 C7-T1 enrol clinical trial 403 treat . Patients randomly assign treat either PCM Cervical Disc ACDF . Patients evaluate surgery , operation , immediately surgery , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month 24 month , yearly surgery . The patient recommend physical therapy program non-impact exercise active range motion exercise surgery . Patients also instruct avoid repetitive cervical flexion extension bend lateral bend rotation 6 week follow surgery . The safety PCM Cervical Disc assess compare adverse event , additional surgical procedure , neurological outcome ACDF control group . The effectiveness PCM Cervical Disc assess evaluate patient ' pain function outcomes use standard questionnaire , Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) , severity neck arm pain base Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) assessment , quality life use standard questionnaire , Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ) , well patient satisfaction questionnaire compare ACDF control group . In addition , patient evaluate use radiographic evaluation , include spinal range motion , spinal disc height , device displacement migration , spinal fusion status , heterotopic ossification ( abnormal bone formation ) . The primary endpoint IDE trial composite measure term `` overall success , '' evaluate 24 month postoperatively , define least 20 % improvement neck disability index ( NDI ) preoperative score ; absence reoperation , revision , removal ; maintenance improvement neurological status ; absence radiographic major complication 24-month follow-up period . On October 26 , 2012 , FDA grant Premarket Approval ( PMA ) PCM Cervical Disc . PCM Cervical Disc indicate use skeletally mature patient reconstruction degenerate cervical disc one level C3-C4 C6-C7 follow single-level discectomy intractable radiculopathy ( arm pain and/or neurological deficit ) , without neck pain , myelopathy due single-level abnormality localize disc space , manifest least one follow condition confirm radiographic imaging ( CT , MRI , X-rays ) : herniated nucleus pulposus , spondylosis ( define presence osteophyte ) , and/or visible loss disc height compare adjacent level .</detailed_description>
