	<brief_summary>Patients diagnose severe Aplastic Anemia respond treatment immunosuppressive therapy ( drug suppress immune system , example Steroids ) . The immune system system body help protect body fight bacterial , viral fungal infection . Research study show patient Aplastic Anemia improve survival ( may live long ) receive HLA ( Human Leukocyte Antigen ) identical sibling ( brother sister ) stem cell transplant . Patients match sibling undergo immunosuppressive therapy , also show improve outcome . Unfortunately patient respond immunosuppressive therapy usually die . The best chance survival patient HLA match unrelated mismatch related stem cell transplant describe . Stem cell create bone marrow . They mature different type blood cell people need include red blood cell carry oxygen around body , white blood cell help fight infection , platelet help blood clot prevent bleeding . For match unrelated stem cell transplant , stem cell collect person ( donor ) relate patient type stem cell . For mismatch related stem cell transplant , stem cell collect donor related patient whose stem cell almost patient exactly . The patient receive high dose chemotherapy . This chemotherapy kill stem cell patient 's bone marrow . Stem cell collect donor give patient replace stem cell kill . The major problem associate type stem cell transplant graft rejection ( patient 's immune system reject donor stem cell ) severe graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , donor stem cell reacts patient 's tissue body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before patient receive treatment , follow : - Complete history physical exam - Dental consultation - Bone marrow aspirate - Blood test - Urinanalysis - Tests look lung ( Chest X-ray PFT 's DLCO ) - Tests look heart ( EKG , MUGA , echocardiogram ) - Pregnancy test female childbearing age . Once decision make patient mismatch related match unrelated stem cell transplant , patient receive treatment call `` conditioning regimen '' prepare body transplant . The purpose condition regimen kill stem cell bone marrow , patient immune system suppress ( lower stop work ) , body reject donor stem cell ( transplant ) . The medicine give part condition regimen include Cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) Campath 1H . Both medication approve Food Drug Administration . Cyclophosphamide give four day row . Cyclophosphamide broken different chemical remove body urine . These different chemical cause bleed bladder . Mesna drug give Cytoxan prevent build chemical cause bleed bladder . Campath 1H also give four day . After medicine , patient receive total body irradiation ( TBI ) . Total body irradiation strong dos radiation ( like x-ray ) give almost whole body . One dose TBI give patient receive matched stem cell infusion two dos TBI give patient receive mismatch stem cell infusion . After condition regimen , patient receive stem cell ( transplant ) . These stem cell give infusion ( drip ) vein . Patients receive drug Tacrolimus ( FK506 ) Methotrexate help prevent complication graft versus host disease . Methotrexate give day 1 , 3 , 6 11 receive stem cell . During time , patient stem cell transplant unit protective isolation help protect develop infection . The following evaluation do part stem cell transplant . EVALUATION DURING THE FIRST 100 DAYS : - Physical examination daily discharge , weekly . - Peripheral Blood chimerism study ( look presence cell donor patient exist together transplant ) - Complete blood count ( CBC ) platelets daily discharge , least weekly - Blood chemistry ( Electrolytes , BUN , creatinine , glucose , calcium , uric acid , total protein , albumin , ALT , AST , LDH , total bilirubin , LDH , magnesium ) check daily discharge , least weekly - FK506 blood level twice week discharge , least weekly - Blood test CMV ( type virus ) weekly DAY 100-365 : - Physical examination least monthly Day 365 - Peripheral blood chimerism study - Follow-up patient chronic GVHD need - Chest X-ray - CBC Blood chemistry test check monthly YEARLY EVALUATION : - Biopsies need ( take tissue sample test ) - Chest x-ray - CBC Blood chemistry evaluation list - Peripheral blood chimerism study IMMUNOLOGIC TESTING : We also look patient immune function . To , take 30 ml ( 2 tablespoonful ) blood every two week two month , monthly 6 month , every 3 month 2 year . When possible , blood take take exist IV line . However , time draw blood require another stick needle . These blood test do research purpose part study . All blood test list do part good clinical care patient receive stem cell transplant .</detailed_description>
