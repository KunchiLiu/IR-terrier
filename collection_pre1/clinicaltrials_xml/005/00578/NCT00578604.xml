	<brief_summary>The objective project development non-invasive optically base NIR ( Near Infrared ) device enable quantitative diagnosis , monitor treatment optimization chronic wound ( especially diabetic ) clinical setting . The end goal project portable compact device would simple operate minimally trained health care personnel . Our animal study show early healing chronic wound characterize absorption scatter light near infrared wavelength range 680 nm 950 nm . If project successful provide clinician ability predict wound heal particular treatment successful accelerate healing change observe wound size contraction visible clinical sign . Our hope fNIR optical device provide conclusive therapeutic treatment information early 5 week initial evaluation , would obvious gross examination patient .</brief_summary>
