	<brief_summary>This study conduct patient diagnosed ulcerative colitis ( UC ) , form inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) - disease intestine . The purpose study test therapeutic ( medical treatment ) effect daily consumption Kyo-Dophilus ( commercially available dietary supplement often used individual inflammatory bowel disease ) UC . Kyo-Dophilus consist three probiotic bacteria ( beneficial bacteria help maintain balance good bacteria intestine ) help treat inflammatory bowel disease cause bad bacteria . Patients still maintain clinical standard care UC part participation study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Probiotics Patients With Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Probiotics define `` live microorganism , , administer adequate amount , confer health benefit host . '' Most probiotic lactic acid produce bacteria endogenous human GI ( gastrointestinal ) tract commonly utilized fermentation food product , yogurt . Disturbances composition bacterial flora GI tract associate diarrhea inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , consumption strain probiotic bacteria effective treat diarrhea possibly individual ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . We test effect 3 strain probiotic bacteria UC . In addition standard medical care UC , participant consume dietary supplement 3 probiotic bacteria ( Kyo-Dophilus ; Lacobacillus acidophilus , Bifidobacterium bifidum , Bifidobacterium longum ) 6 week . Changes clinical symptom physiological marker systemic GI inflammation subject UC assess . Significant effect probiotic determine compare pre- post-probiotic treatment measure disease severity level inflammation compare probiotic treat group placebo treat control group . Any placebo effect UC also assess . Forty subject ulcerative colitis recruit study provide dietary supplement ( 5x109 bacteria/capsule , twice day ) 6 week 1/2 subject 1/2 UC subject give placebo control ( potato starch ) . Standard medical care therapy continue throughout study . Initially , physician complete Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index ( UCDAI ) participants complete Shortened Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ( SIBDQ ) , biopsy collect histopathological assessment analysis inflammatory cytokine production ( mRNA ) . Also , 30 ml venous blood collect subject analysis serum/plasma level inflammatory cytokine stress hormone . Subjects randomly assign probiotic placebo group ( blind physician ) . After consume dietary supplement placebo 6 week , subject complete SIBDQ questionnaire , physician complete UCDAI , examine sigmoidoscopy tissue biopsy blood sample collect . Also , 6 week treatment , subject maintain daily diary bowel habit . Data analysis determine whether , relative placebo control , consumption probiotic reduces symptom level intestinal inflammation patient ulcerative colitis .</detailed_description>
