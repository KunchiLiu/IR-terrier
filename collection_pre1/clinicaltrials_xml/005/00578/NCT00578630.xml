	<brief_title>Interindividual Genetic Variability Determinant Chemotherapy Toxicity Response Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The title study interindividual genetic variability determinant chemotherapy toxicity response pediatric oncology/bone marrow transplantation patient . We collect blood pediatric oncology/bone marrow transplantation patient go receive chemotherapy order ass several define genetic polymorphism may involve chemotherapy toxicity response . The polymorphism assess normal mononuclear cell combination technique . We determine whether polymorphism occur pediatric oncology/bone marrow transplantation patient correlation different clinical feature follow therapy include toxicity response . The presence absence polymorphism correlate patient outcome tumor recurrence .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All Pediatric Oncology Bone Marrow Transplantation Service patient histologically proven tumor intent treat chemotherapy eligible participation study . The patient need newly diagnose enrollment protocol . All patient guardian must provide write informed consent . Minors require provide assent .</criteria>
