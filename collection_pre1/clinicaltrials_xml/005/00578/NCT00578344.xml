	<brief_summary>Patients ask participate study severe sickle cell anemia ( SCD ) without beta thalassemia trait . Sickle cell anemia illness red blood cell change shape clog blood vessel . This keep body get oxygen need . Thalassemia body make enough hemoglobin , something help oxygen get place need go body . The patient may may need get regular blood transfusion ( get blood ) improve quality life ( feel well ) prevent organ damage ( problem brain , heart , lung , kidney , gonad , example. ) . The transfusion also cause problem , include iron overload ( much iron blood ) , fatal ( patient die ) without regular deferoxamine shot . Even best usual treatment , people thalassemia SCD die sooner . There proven cure . We would like treat patient use bone marrow transplantation , treatment use people SCD . The transplant use healthy `` match '' bone marrow . This come brother sister sickle cell disease severe thalassemia . If treatment work , sickle cell disease thalassemia may cure . This treatment use treat patient sickle cell disease thalassemia . It work case . We hope , promise , transplant marrow make healthy cell , patient sickle cell disease severe thalassemia anymore . We know effect treatment damage already do disease . Finding main reason study . Currently , little report organ function bone marrow transplant patient sickle cell anemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prior bone marrow transplant , need patient : - Answer question medical history ; - Undergo physical examination ; - Have test do see well lung work ; - Have chest x-ray ; - Have EKG look heart ; - Have MRI &amp; MRA ( Magnetic Resonance Angiography , look blood vessel blood flow ) . These 2 test look see patient stroke ; - Have PET scan look head body ; - Have liver biopsy determine liver damage ( happen iron overload happen many transfusion ) . Too much liver damage would mean transplant do . For liver biopsy , skin numbed medicine , special needle go liver . The needle remove small piece liver ( tissue ) . The tissue take examine . Also , 30 cc ( 2 tablespoon ) blood draw test blood virus , include HIV ( virus cause AIDS ) . If HIV test positive , transplant do would dangerous patient . At least 2 week bone marrow infusion , patient immunize Prevnar 7 . Prevnar 7 vaccine use child protect type bacteria call Streptococcus pneumoniae , cause lung infection call pneumonia . People Sickle Cell anemia high risk die infection type bacteria . Although child regularly give Prevnar 7 vaccine , common test child 's immune response vaccine . In study , check immune system 's response vaccine draw extra 3 mL ( le 1 teaspoon ) blood 3 week patient get Prevnar 7 vaccine . Just bone marrow transplant , must kill cell bone marrow make abnormal red blood cell find patient severe thalassemia sickle cell disease . We use 3 drug : busulfan , cyclophosphamide , campath-1H . Campath-1H used prevent body reject refuse let donor blood cell grow body . MESNA give cyclophosphamide prevent kidney damage . Methotrexate cyclosporin also give prevent graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) ; methylprednisolone give bone marrow infusion patient develop GVHD . A drug also give prevent seizure ( either dilantin lorazepam ) . Graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) possible side-effect transplant . In GVHD , cell donor marrow attack cell patient 's body . This cause skin , liver , bowel problem , may damage part body . Often , problem fairly mild , severe even cause death . Severe GVHD likely occur 10 % patient . After patient get drug treatment , give bone marrow brother sister healthy bone marrow match patient . The healthy bone marrow put vein ( give IV ) way blood transfusion give . The marrow cell travel right place body , grow make new normal blood cell . This treatment schedule : Protocol Day &amp; Treatment : 14 day bone marrow infusion -- Prevnar 7 vaccine 10 day bone marrow infusion -- Begin Dilantin Lorazepam ( prevent seizure ) 9 day bone marrow infusion -- Busulfan 8 day bone marrow infusion -- Busulfan 7 day bone marrow infusion -- Busulfan 6 day bone marrow infusion -- Busulfan 5 day bone marrow infusion -- Campath 1H , Cyclophosphamide , MESNA 4 day bone marrow infusion -- Campath 1H , Cyclophosphamide , MESNA 3 day bone marrow infusion -- Campath 1H , Cyclophosphamide , MESNA 2 day bone marrow infusion -- Campath 1H , Cyclophosphamide , MESNA , cyclosporin 1 day bone marrow infusion -- DAY OF REST Day `` 0 '' -- bone marrow infusion give 1 day bone marrow infusion -- Methotrexate 3 day bone marrow infusion -- Methotrexate 6 day bone marrow infusion -- Methotrexate 11 day bone marrow infusion -- Methotrexate After transplant , Filgrastrim , growth hormone bone marrow , may give intravenously ( vein ) , medically necessary . Sometimes , donor 's bone marrow grow . Then , patient would without work bone marrow cell . So ready treat problem happen , take bone marrow hip bone patient get drug treatment . The patient asleep ( sedate ) marrow take , give medicine pain afterwards . This bone marrow frozen store preserve . If donor bone marrow grow , thaw store marrow put back body . This store bone marrow grow produce work blood cell . If store bone marrow must give back , disease cure . To tell whether transplant work `` engraft '' , take sample bone marrow ( bone marrow aspirate ) . We 3 week transplant make sure new cell begin grow . We take another marrow sample 3 month transplant . We want make sure new cell still grow . This test take 30 45 minute . Because test painful , patient give pain medicine , , test . The patient need hospital least 3 week transplant make sure transplant engraft . We several test ( lung , kidney , liver ) bone marrow transplant . We want find much treatment help patient much might help patient . Most test do every week 4 month visit hospital . Also , look immune function . To , take 8 ml ( less 2 teaspoonful ) 6 month , 1 year , 2 year transplant . When possible , take blood IV line patient already . However , time draw blood another needle stick . A total amount 200 mL ( 13 tablespoon ) blood collect patient entire study . After 4 month , patient 's health good , need come hospital often . The visit doctor like bone marrow transplant . Since problem may happen month transplant new way treat sickle cell disease thalassemia patient need exam blood test do every month first second year transplant . After , well , patient need examine blood test 4 time year .</detailed_description>
