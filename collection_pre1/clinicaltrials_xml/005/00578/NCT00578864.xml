	<brief_summary>High-risk neuroblastoma aggressive childhood cancer show lump mass belly around spinal cord chest , neck , pelvis . Often tumor spread around body bone soft center bone , call bone marrow . High-risk neuroblastoma often respond treatment first , frequently come back may even difficult treat . Chemotherapy ( drug treatment cancer ) usually give high dos short burst ( 3 5 day ) follow week rest recovery . This burst recovery call `` cycle '' usually take 21 day . Some scientist physician try give chemotherapy lower dos day , call `` metronomic '' chemotherapy . This method give chemotherapy use treat neuroblastoma fail standard type treatment ( relapsed neuroblastoma ) show promise patient . One reason may work kill blood vessel fee tumor well kill tumor cell ( way burst chemotherapy work ) . We think give burst chemotherapy together metronomic therapy may kill tumor decrease side effect see past . Treatment high risk neuroblastoma usually occur 3 stage : induction , consolidation , maintenance . During induction phase , patient receive chemotherapy possibly surgery get rid tumor cell . Most chemotherapy drug induction give standard burst method . One chemotherapy drug , etoposide , give low , metronomic dos . The doctor study tumor respond side effect patient . After induction childrens ' tumor disappear , also call remission . These child receive second stage treatment call consolidation . During stage , subject receive radiation treatment tumor high dos chemotherapy . Because side effect high dos chemotherapy , collect store special blood cell ( call hematopoietic stem cell ) early treatment keep frozen . After high dos chemotherapy , cell thaw give subject . . This call hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) . The final stage treatment , call maintenance , consist drug take mouth 6 month . Surgery remove large , bulky , tumor standard part treatment high risk neuroblastoma . A child main tumor remove chemotherapy , require tumor shrink first . Surgery usually schedule 3 5 cycle therapy , one really know quickly tumor ready come . Because chemotherapy significant side effect change risk surgery , study early surgery remove tumor happen . This study do evaluate outcome disease response survival child high risk neuroblastoma treat regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protracted Etoposide During Induction Therapy High Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Induction Phase Overview The induction phase approximately 15 week long . Chemotherapy generally give every 3 week , 3 week block call `` cycle '' . During 15 week treat subject chemotherapy 5 time use combination 4 different chemotherapy drug . All IV chemotherapy drug give hospital . During 15 week doctor try collect special blood cell call hematopoietic stem cell . If subject 's tumor remove completely surgery take rest tumor soon possible shrunk first two cycle chemotherapy . Induction Phase Chemotherapy During first 2 cycle chemotherapy child receive two drug : cisplatin etoposide . Cisplatin give IV everyone . If participate research treatment plan , etoposide mouth mouth 14 day . After first two cycle repeat study see tumor shrunk . Then child receive two chemotherapy drug call cyclophosphamide adriamycin 3rd cycle . If subject respond first two cycle , 4th cycle IV cisplatin oral etoposide ; subject respond first two cycle , 4th cycle IV cisplatin standard IV etoposide . The 5th cycle adriamycin cyclophosphamide . If subject choose participate research treatment plan , eligible research treatment plan , cycle 1 , 2 , 4 IV Cisplatin IV Etoposide . Here induction treatment : Treatment # 1 , 2 , 4 : Cisplatin etoposide : Cisplatin give day 5 day IV . Etoposide give either mouth day 14 day ( research treatment plan ) IV 3 day ( standard treatment plan ) . Treatment # 3 5 : Cyclophosphamide adriamycin : Cyclophosphamide adriamycin give daily 2 day , drug give IV . Cyclophosphamide may cause irritation bladder another drug call mesna give several time dose help prevent . After treatment # 3 # 5 patient receive drug call G-CSF . It stimulate body make white blood cell ( infection fight cell ) help prevent infection happen chemotherapy . G-CSF injection must give daily . Surgery : If primary tumor remove chemotherapy , subject undergo second surgery receive chemotherapy . Tumor reevaluation cycle # 2 resectable subject surgery time . If possible image tumor take cycle # 3 cycle # 5 . Surgery occur soon tumor resectable Stem Cell Harvest Stem cell special cell make different type blood cell . Usually find bone marrow , chemotherapy many blood stream . Between third fifth cycle induction , stem cell collect blood use procedure call apheresis . The central line catheter connect machine draw subject blood one side catheter , filter stem cell , return rest blood side catheter . Each apheresis procedure take 4-6 hour . The procedure may need do several time collect enough stem cell . The consolidation phase take approximately 15 week complete consist radiation tumor follow high dos chemotherapy hematopoietic stem cell transplant . HERE IS THE TREATMENT PLAN : Local Tumor Radiation : Local radiation therapy give daily 2 week . Radiation beam aim site tumor . Each child 's treatment design . The doctor give radiation discus therapy detail . Some child require sedation radiation therapy . Radiation therapy usually require admission hospital . High Dose Chemotherapy Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Carboplatin , etoposide melphalan : Carboplatin etoposide give daily 4 day follow melphalan 3 day . Stem cell infuse chemotherapy . After high dose therapy subject receive G-CSF help stimulate growth white blood cell . Other drug use chemotherapy prevent decrease side effect treatment . Until stem cell restore safe level blood cell , subject need hospitalize . This treatment may require hospitalization 3 4 week longer . Maintenance Phase Starting approximately 3 month follow stem cell transplant subject receive six monthly treatment 13-cis-retinoic acid . 13-cis retinoic acid drug closely related vitamin A show help stop multiplication remain neuroblastoma cell body . This drug take 2 time day mouth 14 day take follow 14 day . This 28-day cycle repeat 6 time . AFTER COMPLETING STUDY TREATMENT The consolidation phase treatment high risk neuroblastoma last 4 month . The entire treatment last 12-14 month .</detailed_description>
