	<brief_summary>Patients ask participate study cancer blood ( leukemia lymphoma ) myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative ( pre-leukemia ) . We suggest treatment might help live long without disease treatment plan would . This treatment know stem cell transplant . We believe may help patient allows u give much strong dos drug radiation kill diseased cell could give without transplant . We also think healthy cell may help fight diseased cell leave transplant . Stem Cells special `` mother '' cell find bone marrow ( spongy tissue inside bone ) , although also find bloodstream ( peripheral blood ) . As grow , become either white blood cell fight infection , red blood cell carry oxygen remove waste product organs tissue platelet , enable blood clot . For transplant take place , collect stem cell `` donor '' ( person agree donate cell ) give patient . The patient type blood cell cancer blood problem hard cure standard treatment receive stem cell transplant ( SCT ) . If brother sister perfect match agrees donate , stem cell come him/her . Before transplant , two strong drug plus total body irradiation give patient ( pre-conditioning ) . This treatment kill blood-forming cell bone marrow . We give patient healthy stem cell . Once healthy stem cell bloodstream move bone marrow ( graft ) begin produce blood cell eventually mature healthy red blood cell , white blood cell platelet . Also , ask permission draw blood patient measure number certain blood cell call T regulatory cell . T regulatory cell special immune cell control regulate body 's immune response . We want determine whether T regulatory cell important participant graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , infection relapse . In GVHD , certain cell donate marrow blood ( graft ) attack body transplant patient ( host ) . GVHD affect many different part body . The skin , eye , stomach intestine affect often . GVHD range mild life-threatening . We know whether T regulatory cell modify condition . We want measure T regulatory cell learn cell influence condition . If learn T regulatory cell affect condition , may possible modify cell benefit transplant patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before transplant test patient blood virus cause problem transplant . These virus include Hepatitis B , ( cause liver damage ) , cytomegalovirus , ( cause lung disease ) HIV ( cause AIDS ) . If patient positive AIDS virus , able undertake transplant . The patient give 6 dos chemotherapy drug call Ara C high dos ( every 12 hour ) begin 8 day stem cell transplant . Then , another chemotherapy drug call cyclophosphamide give high dos vein two day 7th 6th day transplant . A drug call MESNA give cyclophosphamide . MESNA use decrease side effect cause cyclophosphamide . Radiation treatment give entire body day 4 day transplant . This do 2 time day 4 day . The chemotherapy radiation treatment last 8 day . The patient receive extra radiation treatment certain disease ( central nervous system ( CNS ) disease , testicular disease focal ( localize ) disease ) . The day radiation treatment complete ; patient receive healthy stem cell vein . Once bloodstream , stem cell go bone marrow begin grow In prevention GVHD , patient also receive medicine call FK506 well low dose methotrexate . The FK506 give intravenously ( vein ) initially start 2 day transplant late mouth ( able take oral medication ) . This drug give day several week . Four dos low dose methotrexate give intravenously . The methotrexate give day transplant , 3 , 6 11 day transplant . If GVHD control FK506 , medicine may need give . Your doctor describe medicine time . After patient stem cell transplant , would like collect blood different time point transplantation order study regulatory T cell work grow stem cell transplant . To study cell work system , blood sample take month six month , nine month , one year , 2 year 3 year follow transplant . Approximately 6-8 teaspoon blood collect time . The total blood drawn study three year exceed 1 3/4 cup . This amount consider safe adult . The amount blood collect decreased child and/or patient amount blood collection would appropriate . If patient central line , blood take , extra needle stick need . If patient central line , need one place . This separate procedure patient sign separate consent form . The patient need come clinic day blood draw see Texas Children 's Cancer Center .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients acute chronic leukemia advance Hodgkin non Hodgkin lymphoma myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease unlikely cured standard chemotherapy treatment . This include patient relapsed standard chemotherapy treatment patient first remission unfavorable prognostic feature . Patient must genotype HLA identical stem cell donor . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients life expectancy ( less equal 6 week ) limit disease leukemia . Patients symptomatic cardiac failure unrelieved medical therapy evidence significant cardiac dysfunction echocardiogram ( shorten fraction &lt; 20 % ) . Patients severe renal disease ( i.e. , creatinine great 3 time normal age ) . Patients preexist severe restrictive pulmonary disease ( FVC less 40 % predict ) . Patients severe hepatic disease ( direct bilirubin great 3 mg/dl AST great 500 IU/L ) . Patients severe personality disorder mental illness . Patients severe infection estimation principal investigator prohibits use ablative chemotherapy . Patients document HIV positive . Patients Karnofsky performance score &lt; 60 % Lansky performance score &lt; 50 % . NOTE : Patients would exclude treatment protocol strictly laboratory performance abnormality include principal investigator 's discretion consultation member SCT Policy Procedures Committee .</criteria>
