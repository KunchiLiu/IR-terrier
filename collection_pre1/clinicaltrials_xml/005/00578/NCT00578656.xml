	<detailed_description>In United States , many 6 % child affect food allergy . Milk among common food allergen infant child . Although strict avoidance milk current standard care milk hypersensitivity , conclusive evidence absolute dietary restriction necessary achieve clinical tolerance . The purpose study determine whether ingestion small amount extensively heat milk protein might permit without compromise chance ultimately lose milk hypersensitivity prolong time need achieve clinical tolerance select population milk-allergic participant . The study last 48 month . Based result oral food challenge bake milk participant assign either Group 1 ( bake milk-tolerant ) Group 2 ( bake milk-reactive ) . Participants Group 1 may test regular , non-heated milk , depend diagnostic test result clinical history . Participants tolerant non-heated milk discharge study . Baked milk-tolerant , non-heated milk-reactive participant Group 1 receive diet baked milk home Group 2 act control avoid milk consumption strictly . Qualifying willing participant assign Group 1 , allow consumption bake milk regular basis . Study visit occur Months 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 42 , 48 . Participants Group 1 give OFC use non-heated milk identify tolerant individual Months 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 . Participants Group 2 contact telephone every 6 month ask current state milk allergy . Participants group ask repeat OFC bake milk Months 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 . Depending outcome repeat OFC , may continue strict avoidance ( react bake milk OFC ) allow ingest baked milk diet ( tolerate bake milk OFC ) . At visit , medical history , physical exam , 7-day diet record , anthropometric measurement , skin test blood collection occur . A pregnancy test perform visit require OFC female childbearing potential . A skin prick test occur visit . Participants atopic dermatitis assess SCORAD scale visit .</detailed_description>
