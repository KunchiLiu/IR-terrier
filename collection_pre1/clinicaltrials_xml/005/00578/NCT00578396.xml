	<brief_summary>This study design investigate dietary influence grape colon cancer prevention . A natural compound find skin grape , resveratrol , may protect cancer act antioxidant ( chemical compound substance help reduce damage due oxygen ) . This compound know block colon cancer cell line grow laboratory . The purpose study determine minimum amount resveratrol-rich fresh red grape need exhibit sign prevention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Biomarker Study Dietary Grape-Derived Low Dose Resveratrol Colon Cancer Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It long recognize dietary factor influence risk develop colon cancer , population consume high proportion fruit vegetable low risk . A compound find skin grape , resveratrol , purport colon cancer prevention activity though dosage obtain diet always seem low produce inhibitory effect cancer cell laboratory . We find low concentration resveratrol inhibit Wnt pathway , key signal pathway activate 85 % colon cancer . We also find small pilot trial low dosages freeze-dried grape powder directly inhibit Wnt signal normal colon grape powder effective resveratrol alone block Wnt throughput . This suggest component grape may direct activity inhibit key signal pathway may correlate cancer prevention activity . In study , directly test impact diet contain specific amount red grape context control amount resveratrol contain foodstuff Wnt signal colon . This grape-supplemented diet provide low-dose resveratrol conjunction potentially active component contain within grape . Participants normal volunteer molecular study do colon tissue obtain limited flexible sigmoidoscopy , , red grape-containing diet ingest . Different dosage grape utilized . This study define effect dietary grape-derived low dose resveratrol biomarkers related Wnt pathway , provide critical information utility nutritional approach toward colon cancer prevention . For study , seedless red grape use . Ten participant enrol dose level grape follow : - Dose level 1 : 1 lb/day fresh red grape - Dose level 2 : 2/3 lb/day fresh red grape - Dose level 3 : 1/3 lb/day fresh red grape Participants normal volunteer identify advertisement , referral , community outreach . Primary Objective : Define minimum dietarily achievable amount resveratrol-rich fresh red grape effective inhibit Wnt signal human colonic mucosa . Secondary Objectives 1 . Define whether grape-supplemented diet affect colonic mucosa cell proliferation . 2 . Define side-effects associate resveratrol-rich dietary program .</detailed_description>
