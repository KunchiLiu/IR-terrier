	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether magnetic resonance ( MR ) techniques detect change cause chemotherapy liver patient treat colorectal cancer . Some patient undergo chemotherapy colorectal cancer may experience side-effects liver . These side effect may influence treatment option . If study find MR technique detect change liver due chemotherapy , MR method may eventually use help patient physicians plan treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Study Liver Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each patient 4 MR exam : prior within one week start chemotherapy regimen , one 6 week chemotherapy , third completion chemotherapy ( 12 24 week post-initiation chemotherapy ) long term followup study least 4 month completion chemotherapy . Normal volunteer recruit studied MR comparison patient data .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Provide write informed consent . 21 year age old . Histologically confirm diagnosis colorectal carcinoma ( patient ) . Resected primary colorectal cancer metastatic disease primary colorectal cancer metastatic disease plan resection neoadjuvant chemotherapy metastatic colorectal carcinoma consider attend physician resectable potentially resectable hepatic metastasis ( patient ) . Each patient stag his/her attend physician Department Medicine Surgery . Hepatic metastasis consider resectable expect completely removable negative margin procedure leave behind sufficient liver parenchyma arterial/portal blood supply , venous drainage biliary drainage subsequent regeneration survival . Potentially resectable indicates reduction tumor size due chemotherapy could render tumor resectable . Inability cooperate MR exam . Contraindication MR : Pacemaker Aneurysmal clip Any ferrous metallic implant could deflect magnet Metal implant field view could distort image spectroscopy data Pregnant woman Age mental status wherein he/she unable cooperate MR study Patients consider unresectable hepatic metastasis exclude . Hepatic metastasis consider unresectable removal would leave behind insufficient liver parenchyma subsequent regeneration survival . In addition , hepatic metastasis consider unresectable removal would expect leave behind residual disease ( positive margin ) . Also , patient consider unresectable comorbid condition would jeopardize successful recovery hepatic resection .</criteria>
