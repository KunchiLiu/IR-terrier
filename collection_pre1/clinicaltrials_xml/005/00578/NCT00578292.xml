	<brief_summary>Patients severe beta-thalassemia one thalassemia variant . Thalassemia hereditary disease bone marrow produce abnormal red blood cell short life span normal red blood cell . Because , patient chronically low red blood cell number ( anemia ) need regular blood transfusion help patient feel good help prevent damage important organ heart . The following treatment currently available patient : lifelong blood transfusion drug help remove iron body , long-term antibiotic prevent infection . These treatment difficult patient take , stop effect disease . Currently , treatment may cure thalassemia bone marrow blood stem cell transplantation . Special blood bone marrow cell healthy person might allow bone marrow create healthy cell , replace abnormal red blood cell thalassemia . There lot experience use special blood bone marrow cell healthy brother sister HLA ( immune ) type . For patient donor family , unrelated volunteer donor use . It important patient realize kind transplant problem transplant brother sister . Because know long-term effect treatment type transplant use often people thalassemia , research study . We hope , promise , transplant marrow/stem cell produce healthy cell patient long severe thalassemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To treat study , test blood check virus , include HIV ( virus cause AIDS ) . If HIV test positive , transplant do would dangerous patient . Secondly , liver biopsy determine liver damage ( happen iron overload develop many transfusion ) . Too much liver damage could mean patient high risk develop problem transplant . To participate study , patient also need central line ( thin plastic catheter tube place surgery one large vein neck chest ) . Central line use give intravenous medication ( go directly vein ) take blood sample without patient endure frequent needle stick . Before treatment start , remove small amount bone marrow ( back-up bone marrow ) store . The reason donor bone marrow blood stem cell grow properly transplant patient blood count stay low , put patient bone marrow cell back body . This help blood count recover , mean patient also thalassemia . To prepare body transplant , patient blood form system destroy immune system weaken . To , give high dose chemotherapy medication weaken immune system ( also call condition treatment ) 9 day transplant . The main chemotherapy drug use condition treatment : cyclophosphamide , fludarabine busulfan . The chemotherapy treatment last 9 day . The patient admit 10 day transplant start medicine prevent seizure receive first dose busulfan since one side effect busulfan risk seizure . First patient give drug call busulfan central line every 6 hour start 9 day transplant ( call Day -9 ) 6 day transplant ( call Day -6 ) . Starting one day receive last busulfan dose ( Day -5 ) , receive cyclophosphamide , fludarabine Campath IH , give central line day next four day . Campath IH special type protein call antibody work certain type blood cell . Also Day -5 , add drug call MESNA . MESNA use decrease side-effects cause cyclophosphamide . One day chemotherapy treatment finish ( Say -1 ) patient day rest . On Say 0 , patient receive bone marrow/stem cell donor . Once bloodstream , cell go bone marrow begin grow . To help prevent problem call graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , patient receive small dose methotrexate four different day transplant . Another drug help prevent GVHD , tacrolimus , start 2 day ( Day -2 ) transplant continue approximately one year transplant . To tell whether transplant `` take '' `` engraft '' , take sample blood two three week transplant . The patient need hospital least 4 week transplant make sure transplant engraft . To find much treatment help much might help patient , several routine lung , kidney , liver test , include liver biopsy , bone marrow/stem cell transplant . Additionally , look immune function . To , take 30 mL ( 2 tablespoonful ) blood every three month first year transplant every 6 month second year transplant . When possible , blood take take exist IV line . However , time draw blood require another stick needle . The total amount blood take exceed 12 tablespoonful . Because bone marrow/stem cell transplant unrelated volunteer donor new therapy severe thalassemia problem may happen month afterward , patient need exams blood test do every month first second year follow transplantation . The patient may still need use iron remove agent time transplant undergo blood-letting get rid excess iron body . During time , monitor amount iron body . Looking iron store liver accurately tell u much excess iron patient body . We liver biopsy twice per year patient receive iron chelation treatment transplant .</detailed_description>
