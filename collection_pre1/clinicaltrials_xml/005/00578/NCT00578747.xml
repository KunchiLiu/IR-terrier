	<brief_title>Do Skin Markings Reflect Location Surgical Cavity During Daily Radiotherapy Treatment ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose - A feasibility study determine accuracy use skin marking surrogate underlying surgical cavity ( SC ) accelerate partial breast irradiation . 2 . Hypothesis - Markings place skin accurate representation underlie surgical cavity adequate use patient setup accelerate partial breast irradiation . 3 . Justification Breast conserving surgery use whole breast radiation partial mastectomy prefer treatment woman early stage breast cancer . Conventional radiotherapy set delivers radiation entire breast , consequence radiotherapy give period 3 - 6 week . However , majority ( 70 - 80 % ) local recurrence breast conserve surgery develop vicinity primary tumor . Partial breast irradiation radiation target volume limit surgical cavity ( SC ) select patient therefore potentially feasible result similar local control rate compare whole breast irradiation . In addition limit radiation breast tissue likely harbor microscopic disease thereby spar normal breast tissue , local breast irradiation offer distinct advantage shorten duration radiotherapy , thereby minimize impact radiotherapy quality life breast cancer patient . The current technique accelerate partial breast irradiation assume cutaneous marker correctly reflect position underlie SC without strong evidence relationship two change . Our study provide crucial miss link . Phase II study ( include REB application ) go explore use new image modality reduce PTV margin thereby enable oncologist well spare normal tissue . 4 . The primary objective determine whether skin marking truly reflect surgical cavity location daily treatment quantify change relationship skin marking &amp; surgical cavity . The secondary objective investigate dosimetric consequence change size , shape , location surgical cavity volume ( SCV ) treatment duration . 5 . Methods ( detail see attach protocol ) To determine whether skin marking truly reflect surgical cavity location daily APBI . Briefly , Stage 1 study , 20 breast cancer patient undergo adjuvant radiotherapy breast conserving surgery visible SC ( cavity visualization score 3 - 5 ) recruit . Skin marker place skin around SC CT simulation manner specify RAPID trial . During first week treatment , patient return CT scanner day 1 5 undergo repeat planning CT . The patient set simulate actual treatment set linear accelerator . These repeat scan compare original scan identify change relationship skin marking SC . Five oncologist train SC identification contour SC original well repeat CT scan . These image fuse CT scan form representative SC volume ( RSCV ) . The RSCV planning subsequent CTs related skin mark evaluate reliability patient positioning . Using skin mark beam place patient CT simulation software package . The centre mass ( COM ) RSCV determine contour variation x , , z coordinate average . This allow comparison plan originally change time . Coordinates previously place skin marker breast surface calculate relative COM well medial lateral tattoo . This enable u verify setup external skin mark track RSCV . The dosimetric consequence SCV change shape/size/location quantify follow : 1 . Repeat CTs drawn RSCVs export plan system plan field apply calculate dose distribution target volume organ risk . 2 . Dose-volume histogram ( DVH ) CTV , PTV organs risk , define CT evaluate meet plan criterion . 3 . The procedure repeat simulated patient realignment use CT data set . 4 . Appropriate PTV margin achieve desire CTV coverage calculate situation , without simulated realignment . 6 . Statistical Analysis Sample Size : For Stage I , 20 patient successfully accrue 6 month Fraser Valley Cancer Centre . Comparison skin mark surgical cavity The centre mass ( COM ) RSCV determine mean variation x , , z coordinate calculate . In addition , mean standard deviation change volume RSCV calculate . The movement COM coordinate calculate reference tattoo point guard separately . A paired t-test use ass whether statistically significant difference mean COM movement reference tattoo centre spot . This allow u verify setup external skin mark ( tattoos point guard respectively ) track RSCV . DVH comparison The dosimetric consequence change shape , size , location RSCV quantify analysis DVHs ( see section 7.5. ) . Descriptive statistic use present change DVH target volume ( CTV , PTV , DEV ) OAR occur initial simulate plan 5 additional simulate plan ( see section 7.2 7.5 ) . Furthermore , repeat plan undergone simulate realignment . A paired t-test use ass whether statistically significant difference mean change DVH ( target volume OAR ) simulate realignment . Potential decrease CTV PTV margin The margin require CTV create PTV ensure adequately cover , obtain use DVH criterion Table 2 . Subsequently , repeat plan undergone simulate realignment . A paired t-test use ass whether statistically significant difference mean change CTV margin need simulated realignment . Simulated patient realignment compensates portion CTV PTV margin ( size , shape position RSCV ) still leave uncertainty ( e.g. , patient respiration , daily setup ) . Therefore hypothesized decrease PTV need simulated realignment . We consider decrease PTV margin â‰¥ 3 mm simulate patient realignment justification progression Stage II study .</detailed_description>
