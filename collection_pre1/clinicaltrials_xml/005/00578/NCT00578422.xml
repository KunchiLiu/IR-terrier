	<brief_summary>Peripheral Artery Disease involve buildup fatty deposit ( plaque ) within blood vessel restrict blood flow . Patients PAD claudication ( pain leg exercise due poor blood circulation ) may eligible clinical trial . Three primary hypothesis test study : ( 1 ) IVUS ( Intravascular Ultrasound ) combine advanced digital image signal processing provide sensitive method determine plaque geometry composition human peripheral artery wall ; ( 2 ) IVUS discern specific arterial wall morphology , provide data use identify plaque predispose patient late complication ; ( 3 ) IVUS-derived plaque structure use predict responder non-responders pharmacologic therapy percutaneous endovascular intervention . These hypothesis test follow : ( 1 ) custom engineer IVUS analysis software use describe geometry , composition , spatial component relationship vessel , ( 2 ) morphology low extremity arterial plaque , determine IVUS , correlate baseline clinical characteristic subject , ( 3 ) effect plaque morphology long term treatment antihyperlipidemics determine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Advances pathophysiology Peripheral Arterial Disease ( PAD ) limit inaccessibility blood vessel precise diagnostic interrogation . Traditional method study disease peripheral arterial blood vessel significant limitation . The development refinement IVUS ( Intravascular Ultrasound ) provide powerful vivo method ass plaque morphology . The potential IVUS quantify structure geometry normal atherosclerotic peripheral artery allow one characterize specific lesion distinguish plaque lead complication . Three primary hypothesis test study : ( 1 ) IVUS combine advanced digital image signal processing provide sensitive method determine plaque geometry composition human peripheral artery wall ; ( 2 ) IVUS discern specific arterial wall morphology , provide data use identify plaque predispose patient late complication ; ( 3 ) IVUS-derived plaque structure use predict responder non-responders pharmacologic therapy percutaneous endovascular intervention . These hypothesis test follow : ( 1 ) custom engineer IVUS analysis software use describe geometry , composition , spatial component relationship vessel , ( 2 ) morphology low extremity arterial plaque , determine IVUS , correlate baseline clinical characteristic subject , ( 3 ) effect plaque morphology long term treatment antihyperlipidemics determine . There three arm trial . ( 1 ) IVUS Amputation Specimens : Histological section fresh arterial segment amputation specimen correlate IVUS derive radiofrequency data quantify arterial plaque burden composition ( dense calcium , fibrous , fibro-fatty , necrotic core component ) . ( 2 ) Observational Study : Patients undergo standard low extremity angiography PAD study IVUS sit . IVUS find correlated demographic factor ( age , gender , race ) symptom severity ( claudication , rest pain , tissue loss ) . Patients follow five year , occurrence ischemic event ( worsen leg ischemia , need intervention re-intervention , distant complication MI stroke ) reconcile arterial wall baseline examination . ( 3 ) Randomized Clinical Trial : A randomized , double-blinded clinical trial high-dose atorvastatin vs. low dose atorvastatin perform patient intermittent claudication , base hypothesis statin therapy result stabilization regression low extremity arterial plaque , difference best assess high resolution image study . Enrollment goal meet due treatment paradigm shift aggressive LDL control , therefore overwhelming majority patient exclude due exist statin therapy . On 6/25/08 protocol inform consent amend reflect elimination Randomized arm study restructuring arm Cohort Observational arm , correlate patient ' current statin dosage LDL level plaque morphology . This current design arm .</detailed_description>
