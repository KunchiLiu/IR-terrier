	<brief_summary>The goal study look surgical recovery quality life men open versus robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( RP ) . RP procedure remove prostate gland . We want see long take return health strength surgery . Quality-of-life ( QOL ) mean feel life treatment prostate cancer . The QOL survey ask question sexual , urinary bowel function . We also ask question use health care service , out-of-pocket-spending medical care return work , order learn financial impact prostate cancer treatment . We hope survey help show prostate cancer treatment affect daily life surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Quality Life Outcomes After Open Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospectively assess clinical outcome health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) men undergo open , robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy . Open radical prostatectomy frequently perform treatment patient clinically localize ( cT1-T2 ) prostate cancer . The open technique stand benchmark treatment , include new surgical technique , must compare . Robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy consider alternative surgical option clinically localized prostate cancer . While minimally invasive technique frequently perform United States , detail comparison open robotic-assisted laparoscopic technique perform . The relative risk benefit surgical treatment option explore contemporary group patient treat center surgeon experience open robotic-assisted laparoscopic technique . This study address deficiency follow-up information collect prospectively consecutive patient undergo open robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy . While prospective , randomized trial might consider appropriate methodology conduct comparative study , baseline information , guideline ass robotic-assisted laparoscopic competence , lack skilled robotic-assisted laparoscopic pelvic surgeon justify lengthy expensive trial . We also collect information health service utilization employment 12-month postoperative period order assess economic impact different surgical approach . While result propose study necessarily generalizable surgeon may well comparison surgeon rather technique , result provide initial assessment compare expert open robotic-assisted laparoscopic technique . To date , comparison publish . To knowledge , center expert surgeon technique study would feasible . Because open technique improve dramatically past several year , baseline data record proposal currently collect , use historical control open radical prostatectomy would inappropriate .</detailed_description>
