	<brief_summary>This study patient chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) , disorder immune system put risk severe infection . CGD cause genetic defect stop prevents white blood cell kill certain bacteria fungi . This condition presently cure standard treatment drug surgery . The course time CGD may differ severity among patient , child develop severe infection young age likely severe clinical course . Medicine include antibiotic , antifungal , interferon gamma , may help patient CGD ; however even continuous treatment medication , patient CGD chronic recurrent infection . Transfusion healthy normal white blood cell may help overcome infection , white cell transfusion lead allergic reaction fever benefit transfusion last matter hour . Ultimately , chronic infection damage injure body organs lung , liver , bone . Injury lung liver lead lung liver failure death . Medicines use treat infection damage body organs kidney . Infections may become resistant antibiotic antifungal treatment , infection respond treatment deadly . It know specific condition special treatment , blood stem cell ( cell make blood ) transfer transplanted one person another . Stem cell transplantation do patient CGD healthy brother sister share immune type ( HLA type ) patient . Stem cell transplantation allow healthy normal white cell stem cell donor grow develop patient 's bone marrow make donor 's white cell . These healthy white cell fight infection prevent future infection patient CGD . Patients study receive stem cell relate unrelated donor . The donor closely matched patient immune type donor brother sister . This type transplantation do time patient CGD , although type transplant commonly do reason , e.g . leukemia . The reason treatment investigational know likelihood benefit patient receive . It possible great benefit , like patient transplant brother sister . It possible side-effects treatment may severe transplant wo n't work . The purpose research study evaluate whether patient CGD treat stem cell transplant non-matched and/or non-related donor good outcome procedure acceptable number side-effects .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order transplant stem cell need give patient drug high-dose chemotherapy kill destroy blood form immune cell bone marrow . This necessary allow donor stem cell live grow ( engraft ) bone marrow space . After drug treatment complete , patient give stem cell donor . The drug treatment follow : Day -9 Busulfan Day -8 Busulfan Day -7 Busulfan Day -6 Busulfan Day -5 Alemtuzumab , Fludarabine , Cyclophosphamide Day -4 Alemtuzumab , Fludarabine , Cyclophosphamide Day -3 Alemtuzumab , Fludarabine , Cyclophosphamide Day -2 Alemtuzumab , Fludarabine , Cyclosporine , Cyclophosphamide Day -1 REST Day 0 Stem cell infusion The day chemotherapy treatment complete , patient receive healthy stem cell vein , like blood transfusion . Once bloodstream , marrow cell go bone marrow grow . It also possible marrow take , cause disease know graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . To prevent GVHD , give patient cyclosporine Methotrexate . Methotrexate administer Days 1 , 3 , 6 11 transplant . The cyclosporine therapy continue long period time , however patient develop GVHD , discontinue 6 month stem cell transplant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : CGD patient document abnormal NBT assay male patient and/or abnormal NADPH enzyme mutation confirm genetic analysis abnormal NBT . Patients must HLA genotype identical donor . Patients must 5/6 6/6 HLAmatched unrelated donor 5/6 6/6 HLA phenotypematched related donor . Patients must least one serious infection characteristic manifest patient CGD . Patients must active infection . An active infection may include follow : 1 ) clinical finding consistent infection fever , cavitary organ lesion , osteomyelitis ; 2 ) progression presume infection base upon finding diagnostic imaging ( two study least 1 month part ) . No cumulative organ dysfunction , estimation treat physician , diminish patient 's likelihood survive procedure . Negative pregnancy test postpubertal female patient . Echocardiogram shorten fraction &gt; /= 28 % . DLCO 50 % great predict FEV1 &gt; /= 50 % predict . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Active uncontrolled infection ( e.g . lung infection , cavitary organ lesion , osteomyelitis ) . Markedly elevate C reactive protein sedimentation rate relative patient 's baseline . Invasive bone bone marrow disease . Lack potential hematologic blood product donor past ( related McLeod phenotype ) .</criteria>
