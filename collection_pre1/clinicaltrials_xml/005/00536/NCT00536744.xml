	<brief_title>Effectiveness dermaPACE™ Device Standard Treatment Compared Standard Treatment Alone Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective clinical study compare safety effectiveness dermaPACE ( Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression ) Device sham application , administer conjunction standard care , treatment DFUs . Diabetic patient susceptible chronic foot ulceration due effect diabetic 's systemic disease halt wound heal process . In United States , 20.8 million people active diabetes , 41 million pre-diabetic symptom account $ 132 billion dollar healthcare cost per year . In 2002 , 82,000 non-traumatic lower-limb amputation perform diabetic , correspond 60 % low limb amputation , usually precede non-healing foot ulceration . Given magnitude disease long-term effect morbidity amputation , DFUs require immediate aggressive treatment ascertain best possible outcome diabetic patient . Despite development advance wound care product , still need find effective treatment reduce time require close DFU . At give time , 3-4 % diabetic ( 600,000 patient ) foot ulcer , $ 2.5 billion spent 2002 United States treat DFUs . The average cost single episode foot ulcer report $ 4,595.00 $ 28,691.00 . Shock wave device , utilize acoustic pressure wave , use 30 year urology lithotripsy . In last decade technology gain FDA approval treat chronic plantar fasciitis lateral epicondylitis condition respond conservative treatment ( OssaTron® SANUWAVE , manufacturer ) . Further , clinical report indicate efficacy treat many orthopedic condition include pseudoarthroses , calcification joint avascular necrosis . This technology also show promote heal several wound-healing application , worthwhile continue seek full potential technology wound heal . Acoustic pressure wave initiate biological response cellular level-stimulating production angiogenic growth factor , include endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( ENOS ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , proliferate cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) . These factor important component normal wound heal process . This cellular activation growth factor expression stimulate acoustic pressure wave treatment could play decisive role overcome cell quiescence increase growth factor titer level sufficient overcome protease . This lead in-growing newly form vessel , increase cellular proliferation tissue regeneration need heal wound . Clinical publication recently report pressure wave induce mechanism describe initiate accelerate healing burn , traumatic wound reconstructive skin flap , diabetic wound . A pilot study use dermaPACE device , perform nine diabetic subject chronic leg ulcer show technology patient history chronic ulcer may achieve wound closure . Treatment dermaPACE add benefit non-invasive devoid significant clinical side effect . Therefore , objective study examine safety effectiveness dermaPACE acoustic pressure wave treatment device combination standard care treatment foot ulcer diabetic patient . The dermaPACE offer improve non-invasive standard care may shorten otherwise lengthy heal process therefore make later operative measure unnecessary . Given conservative therapy may effective , dermaPACE may become preferable alternative would carry minimal risk base expect clinical outcome describe protocol . dermaPACE may improve patient quality life conservative therapy effective well provide cost saving health care system .</detailed_description>
