	<brief_title>Effect Real Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring System Management Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In diabetes management , compliance , disease awareness empowerment patient play important role immediate feedback effect diet exercise self monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) may provide , could enhance patient empowerment . Increased use SMBG show associate improved medication compliance well metabolic control several study . However , many factor , include pain inconvenience , many diabetic patient accept frequent fingersticks self blood glucose monitoring ( SBGM ) level . In addition , SBGM result give data second , without information glucose trend . So need new glucose monitoring method could reflect glucose trend glycemic excursion continuously glucose monitoring still remain cornerstone evaluate efficacy therapy motivate self disease control subject diabetes . Few study examine effect real time continuous glucose monitoring system target type 2 diabetes . So goal determine whether Guardian Continuous Glucose Monitoring System home set useful frequent self blood glucose monitoring view modify patient 's diet exercise habit improvement self disease control effort last glycemic control patient type 2 diabetes</detailed_description>
