	<brief_summary>The purpose protocol determine 3 variable mortality prediction model establish use data retrospective , multi-center patient registry ( The ADHERE Acute Decompensated HEart FailuRE National Registry ) hold prospective , observational outcome study OSU patient diagnose Emergency Department ( ED ) Acute Decompensated Heart Failure ( ADHF ) . In retrospective registry , three parameter find highly predictive inpatient mortality patient admit ADHF - admission , BUN &gt; 43 mg/dL , systolic BP &lt; 115 mmHg , Cr &gt; 2.75 mg/dL . However , nature ADHERE database limit analytic potential model , data capture ADHERE retrospective limit inpatient stay , outcome evaluate inpatient mortality . Due inherent limitation , model could address long term outcome , repeat visit emergency department discharge , need readmission acute care set , frequently occur soon discharge patient survive discharge admit ADHF . This observational study create registry patient information obtain interview patient review patient 's medical record . Follow information 30 day post discharge obtain phone interview patient review patient 's OSUMC visit history . Most ED patient diagnose ADHF admit , emergency physician aware heart failure general carry high mortality rate . However , risk stratification ADHF severely research area , clear patient acutely decompensated heart failure poor outcome short intermediate term . With improved understanding risk profile ADHF patient , appropriate decision make disposition assignment make .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Mortality Prediction Model Acutely Decompensated Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) affect nearly 5 million people United States steadily increase prevalence . It single expensive diagnosis CMS United States , responsible one million hospitalization per year . There wealth evidence base management strategy long term care patient chronic , stable heart failure . Unfortunately , dearth evidence management patient acutely decompensated heart failure . By way illustration , American College Cardiology American Heart Association ( ACC/AHA ) issue voluminous guideline management chronic CHF ; date recommendation management ADHF issue ACC/AHA . As observational study , experimental portion solely data collection . The research team attempt guide clinical care . Demographic data , vital sign presentation , medical history , advance directive status , laboratory value admission ( BNP , BUN , Cr , troponin ) , use intravenous vasoactive medication , laboratory value discharge alive ( discharge BNP , BUN , Cr ) , critical care utilization , final discharge diagnosis , hospital length stay collect . Patients contact phone 30 day initial presentation ass survival , ED usage , rehospitalization . Specific Aim # 1 : We evaluate performance three factor model ( BUN &gt; 43 mg/dL , systolic blood pressure &lt; 115 mmHg , Cr &lt; 2.75 mg/dL ) use prospective cohort patient admit primary diagnosis ADHF predict ICU utilization hospital length stay . Specific Aim # 2 : We test ability model predict expand combined endpoint mortality , readmission Emergency Department , readmission inpatient observation set within 30 day presentation ADHF . Specific Aim # 3 : We incorporate test additional variable Fonarow model derive rule predict 30 day combine endpoint death , readmission Emergency Department , readmission inpatient observation set within 30 day presentation ADHF .</detailed_description>
