	<brief_title>Chest Pain Observation Unit Risk Reduction Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasingly , emergency department patient non-ischemic etiology acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) symptom identify undergo evaluation rule myocardial ischemia appraisal cardiovascular risk factor ( CRFs ) chest pain observation unit ( CPOUs ) . CPOU admission may represent `` teachable moment , '' little research effectiveness brief , practical intervention cardiovascular risk reduction population , despite fact vast majority patient least one modifiable CRF many receive regular primary care follow-up . The purpose study determine whether brief counsel intervention initiate CPOU significant impact upon health attitude ( readiness change ) cardiovascular risk-related behavior ( diet , exercise , smoke ) . Based Health Belief Model ( HBM ) , intervention design provide patient tailor information cardiovascular risk , negotiate goal change , build problem-solving skill . All participant admit CPOU evaluation ACS symptom randomize brief intervention ( face-to-face counseling CPOU , couple telephone counsel 4 week ) minimal intervention ( booklet general information CRFs ) negative initial troponin measurement . We conduct baseline survey follow-up telephone interview 2- 6-month ass stage change CRF-related behavior . Linear mixed model logistic regression ( generalized estimate equation ) use compare continuous dichotomous behavioral outcome across treatment arm , respectively . The propose trial evaluate feasibility effectiveness deliver brief intervention cardiovascular risk reduction CPOU setting , provide insight mechanism behavior change patient , guide development future case management intervention .</detailed_description>
