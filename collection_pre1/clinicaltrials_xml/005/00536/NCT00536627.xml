	<brief_title>Efficacy Tolerance Naked DNA Vaccine Patients With Chronic B Hepatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite availability effective vaccine hepatitis B , 370 million people worldwide remain persistently infect HBV . Persistent infection associate chronic liver disease lead developement cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma two-third person . Treatment chronic hepatitis B relies use analog lamivudine , adefovir , entecavir immunostimulators interferon . Although analogs efficient , genotypic resistance occur one year treatment rate virologic relapse high treatment discontinuation . HBV non cytopathic virus liver damage cause immune response infect hepatocytes non specific inflammatory response . Immune response contribute virus clearance . In acute hepatitis B infection , T cell response polyclonal , specific vigorous , whereas patient chronic infection , response remain weak , less specific hardly detectable peripheral blood . T cell response could induce restore antigenic stimulation vaccination . In previous phase I clinical trial , show DNA vaccination plasmid pCMVS2.S safe specifically , transiently activate T-cell response chronic HBV-carriers respond current antiviral therapy . Analogs lamivudine adefovir show enhance T cell response concomitantly viral load decrease . In phase I/II clinical trial , would like determine DNA vaccination chronic HBV patient treatment NRTI restore T-cell responsiveness delay virologic reactivation treatment discontinuation .</detailed_description>
