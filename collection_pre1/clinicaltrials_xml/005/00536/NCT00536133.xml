The contrast effect zinc diarrhoea acute low respiratory infection report several study public health concern , zinc supplementation carry many nutrition rehabilitation unit . Further many randomize control trial supplement syrup also contain vitamin , include vitamin A , know effect respiratory morbidity . Most trial evaluate effect zinc respiratory morbidity mortality community base child well know cause recurrent acute low respiratory infection exclude study pool .
