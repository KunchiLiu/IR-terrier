	<brief_summary>We hope learn certain people high level 5-LO protein whether take fish oil supplement give individual great protection others cardiovascular disease . The 5-LO protein important development heart disease convert type oil meat compound cause inflammation blood vessel . This inflammation major cause heart disease . Researchers think people high level protein call 5-LO white blood cell may healthier response use fish oil supplement people low level protein .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fish oil supplement give subject different variant promoter region arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase ( ALOX5 ) gene outcome measure evaluate 6 wk supplementation . These outcome include ALOX5 protein level ( also call 5-lipoxygenase , 5-LO ) , leukotriene level , marker inflammation , blood lipid . The 5-LO enzyme convert arachidonic acid ( AA ) leukotrienes promote inflammation . Subjects different promoter variant hypothesize different basal stimulate level 5-LO expression . Preliminary data suggest subject promoter variant cause increase 5-LO expression also may `` good '' anti-inflammatory lipid-lowering response fish oil supplement . The homozygous variant genotype much common African Americans group thus propose conduct study African Americans . The fish oil eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) competitively inhibits conversion AA pro-inflammatory 4-series leukotrienes . The grant propose conduct community-based , double-masked , randomize , placebo-controlled trial ; n = 15/group , total = 166 ( genotype 44 n = 8 ) . The intervention group receive 5.0 g/d fish oil concentrate ( 3.0 g/d EPA + DHA ) 6 wk . The study conduct Oakland , Davis , Sacramento , California African Americans 20 - 59 age without serious chronic disease recruit . A recent observational study indicate subject variant allele ALOX5 may great risk cardiovascular disease , time , may derive great benefit omega-3 fatty acid supplement subject homozygous common allele . The variant allele less common white population ( 18 % ) black population ( 52 % ) . Since African Americans high prevalence cardiovascular disease ALOX5 variant allele , show epidemiologic study , may great benefit omega-3 supplementation reduction inflammation cardiovascular risk factor . Recruitment conduct community service , Ethnic Health Institute ( EHI ) , Alta Bates Summit Medical Center conjunction UCD , outreach effort USDA , ARS , Western Human Nutrition Research Center ( WHNRC ) UC Davis . We determine subject one two variant ALOX5 alleles high ALOX5 gene expression , high production AA-derived leukotrienes , good response omega-3 supplement subject homozygous common allele .</detailed_description>
