	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial combine fludarabine , rituximab , lenalidomide untreated minimally treat ( Phase I ) CLL patient , employ fix dos fludarabine rituximab , use schedule similar examine investigator MD Anderson ( J Clin Oncol 23 ( 18 ) :4079-88 , 2005 ) . Given optimal dose schedule currently know , trial perform phase I component follow phase II examination explore regimen 's activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludarabine , Rituximab , Lenalidomide Minimally Treated/Untreated Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While progress make treat CLL patient last decade , cure remain elusive many patient treated standard therapy . The combination fludarabine , purine analog , rituximab , monoclonal antibody , effective frequently use therapy CLL . However , drug combination associate increased toxicity . Lenalidomide show less toxic used treat hematologic malignancy include CLL . We propose Phase I/Phase II study examine combination lenalidomide rituximab/fludarabine backbone .</detailed_description>
