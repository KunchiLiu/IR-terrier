	<brief_title>A Study Iron Oligosaccharide Chronic Kidney Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iron dextrans market 50 year compile preclinical clinical experience iron dextrans general well establish . Pharmacosmos A/S already market iron dextran CosmoFer® worldwide , except US product name INFeD® . A new iron oligosaccharide manufacture Pharmacosmos A/S development CosmoFer® ferric hydroxide combine low molecular weight oligosaccharide relatively strong complex . This iron carbohydrate complex build well establish efficacy safety profile exist iron dextran significantly reduce anaphylactic potential . In order ensure iron oligosaccharide lead unexpected adverse event exist clinical information iron dextrans general need supply clinical safety data limit number relevant patient expose iron oligosaccharide open label non-comparator study . The primary objective present study obtain safety reassurance use iron oligosaccharide give either repeat IV bolus total dose infusion correction/maintenance therapy anaemia patient chronic kidney disease need parenteral iron due either absolute functional iron deficiency anaemia .</detailed_description>
