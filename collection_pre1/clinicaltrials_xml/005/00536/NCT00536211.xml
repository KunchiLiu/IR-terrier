	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine decline physical activity acutely lead decrease insulin sensitivity skeletal muscle . The hypothesis loss insulin sensitivity follow physical inactivity cause rapid reduction skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physical Inactivity Insulin Resistance Skeletal Muscle .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In project study two diverse group subject . Group 1 subject sedentary , insulin resistant , Metabolic Syndrome . These subject test insulin sensitivity whole body level , key change skeletal muscle metabolism baseline , follow 12 week exercise training , acute ( 1-3 day ) period time follow cessation exercise training . The design allow u study effect exercise improve insulin sensitivity make direct comparison period insulin sensitivity quickly decrease removal exercise training . Metformin drug commonly prescribe control insulin resistance type 2 diabetes . Metformin think exercise like effect muscle metabolism know activate molecule de-activated inactivity . Thus , half Metabolic Syndrome subject cease exercise training treatment another half quite exercise training take drug Metformin . Group 2 subject highly trained endurance athlete . Endurance athlete display high level insulin sensitivity drop hour day follow cessation exercise . Thus take measurement endurance athlete baseline normal train regimen acute ( 1-3 day ) period follow cessation exercise training . Again , half subject take Metformin cessation exercise fashion do group 1 . Studies group seek determine event ( ) cause insulin resistance skeletal muscle follow decrease physical activity level . Comparisons healthy , active individual sedentary Metabolic Syndrome subject may provide additional information underlie event cause insulin resistance .</detailed_description>

Subjects exclude study : Diagnosed cardiovascular disease diabetes disease symptom could alter ability perform exercise , fast blood glucose great 126 mg/dl , smoker , take medication supplement ( e.g. , statin , fibrates , metformin , thiazolidinediones , antihypertensive ( ACEinhibitors angiotensin blocker ) could affect blood lipid insulin sensitivity . Women pregnant plan become pregnant duration study For Metabolic Syndrome subject individual exercise regularly ( one 30 min session per week ) physically active lifestyle ( &gt; 8,000 daily step measure pedometer ) exclude . Individuals orthopedic limitation walk . Allergies drug use study . Past current liver and/or kidney problem nature .</criteria>
