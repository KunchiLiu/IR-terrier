	<brief_summary>Tetralogy Fallot one frequent congenital heart malformation . In many case re-interventions , surgical catheter-based , necessary repair tetralogy Fallot infancy . At present , information literature myocardial benefit time re-interventions miss age group . On hand , Fallot patient dependent solid criterion re-interventions , intervention like replacement pulmonary valve balloon dilatation peripheral pulmonary stenosis common . The objective study assess benefit intervention right ventricular function . By perform extensive standardise examination ( include MRI , echocardiography , tissue Doppler , ,3D-echocardiography , holter monitoring quality life assessment ) 6 9 month re-intervention data right ventricular function collect . Based quantitative data predictive parameter concern right ventricular recovery information time re-intervention determine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In repair tetralogy Fallot , pulmonary insufficiency use tacitly accept result extensive transannular patching ( TAP ) consider unobjectionable . In fact , well tolerate first postoperative year , today increase evidence result chronic volume stress right ventricle harmful long run , particular stenosis pulmonary artery addition . Such stenosis , partly due distortion shunt surgery , together pulmonary insufficiency , lead combine volume pressure load right ventricle . The chronic volume stress result decrease biventricular function exercise tolerance , associate increase electrical instability frequent , mostly ventricular , dysrhythmias . This constellation bring significantly increase risk cardiac death . Pulmonary valve replacement improve haemodynamics , exercise tolerance dysrhythmia . However , still unclear , criterion best indicate need re-intervention , balloon dilatation peripheral pulmonary stenosis , may best point time infancy . The objective study ass effectiveness intervention right ventricular function small child . The data obtain suppose determine predictive parameter right ventricular recovery help establish criterion necessity time re-intervention .</detailed_description>
