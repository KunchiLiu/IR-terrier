	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Nebulized dornase alfa inhalation solution may decrease thickness saliva mouth improve quality life patient undergoing radiation therapy chemotherapy head neck cancer . It yet know whether dornase alfa inhalation solution effective placebo lessen discomfort treatment patient . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study well dornase alfa inhalation solution work compare placebo treat patient stage III stage IV head neck cancer undergo radiation therapy chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine use nebulized dornase alfa inhalation solution improve overall daily symptom quality life well reduce treatment discomfort radiotherapy chemotherapy patient stage III IV squamous cell carcinoma head neck . - To determine daily nebulized dornase alfa inhalation solution give prior radiotherapy reduce thick oropharyngeal secretion associate curative radiotherapy chemotherapy patient . - To determine reduction thick oropharyngeal secretion use nebulized dornase alfa inhalation solution decrease incidence mucositis , infection , aspiration pneumonia . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive nebulized dornase alfa inhalation solution via oral inhalation approximately 30 minute prior radiation therapy day 1-5 . Treatment continue 4 week ( week 3-6 radiation therapy ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive nebulized placebo via oral inhalation approximately 30 minute prior radiation therapy day 1-5 . Treatment continue 4 week arm I . All patient assess treatment-related symptom treatment disturbance daily radiation therapy . Patients assessed quality life weekly radiation therapy monthly follow-up 3 month . Clinical symptom ( i.e. , mucositis , bacterial fungal infection , aspiration pneumonia ) also assess weekly radiation therapy . Sputum sample collect prior initiate radiation therapy ( baseline ) periodically week 3 radiation treatment evaluate salivary DNA level . After completion study therapy , patient follow monthly 3 month every 3-4 month minimum 2 year .</detailed_description>
