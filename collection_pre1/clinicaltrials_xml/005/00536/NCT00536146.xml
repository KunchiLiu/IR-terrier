	<brief_summary>This study , conduct University Texas Southwestern Medical Center Parkland Hospital Dallas , examine stress hormone system alcohol-dependent people . This system weaken alcohol-addicted people . This study determine long weaken , whether hormone system also weaken whether change hormone system associate previous trauma stress . Healthy normal men men alcohol-dependent may eligible study . Candidates must 21 60 year age least 5-year history active alcohol dependence . They screen medical history , blood urine test question alcohol drug use , psychiatric problem , history trauma recent stress . Participants undergo follow procedure : Day 1 - Public Speaking Task At 6:00 PM subject I.V . line ( needle attach small plastic tube ) insert vein arm draw blood sample give medication . They give light dinner lie rest . They rinse mouth water drop lemon juice place tongue . In 30 40 second spit funnel attach collect tube . A blood sample collect measure level cortisol ( stress hormone ) ACTH ( hormone responsible release cortisol ) neurosteroids ( hormone affect brain ) . Subjects give 5-minute speech ( tell end story ) solve math problem front small group people . They ask feel . Saliva blood sample collect every 10 minute next 60 minute . Day 2 - Cosyntropin Study At 6:30 p.m. subject I.V . line insert vein arm . At 7:45 PM 8:30 PM saliva collect describe . Starting 7:30 PM , blood sample collect every 10 minute 9:00 PM every 20 minute 10:00 PM . At 8:00 PM cosyntropin ( medicine stimulate production cortisol ) give I.V . 1 minute . Day 3 - oCRH Study At 6:30 p.m. subject I.V . line insert vein arm . At 7:45 PM 8:30 PM saliva collect describe . Starting 7:30 PM , blood sample collect every 10 minute 9:00 PM every 20 minute 10:00 PM . At 8:00 PM ovine CRH ( medicine stimulate production cortisol ) give I.V . 1 minute . Participants may ask repeat study 3 month later .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Stress-Hormone System Alcohol-Dependent Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis provide key biologic link brain body 's behavioral physiologic response stress , recovery , adaptation . Both mental trauma chronic alcohol use may produce disturbance HPA response stress . Thus , change system period alcohol intake may impair body 's ability mount appropriate response environmental stressor , heighten probability additional alcohol intake . However , relationship trauma , stress , HPA axis disturbance require study . In study , NIH investigator attempt determine sensitivity glucocorticoid gene induction varies stress . Blood sample obtain The University Texas Southwestern Medical Center ( TSMC ) collaboration Veteran 's Affairs Medical Center ( VA ) Dallas , Texas protocol consent form approve TSMC IRB . Only sample collect described TSMC protocol study NIH .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : AlcoholDependent Subjects : Male , 2160 yr , DSMIV diagnosis alcohol dependence , 46 week abstinence ; Alcohol intake least 80 gram absolute alcohol ( approximately one sixpack beer onehalf pint 100 % proof distilled spirit ) daily basis least two week prior cessation drinking . Years drink : least 5 yr history active alcohol dependence ; Lifetime drug choice alcohol ; request treatment longterm residential program . Healthy Controls : Thirty men agematched ( plus minus 5 year ) patient study . Previous study typically use presence absence trauma define trauma group . However , study focus specific type trauma ( i.e . childhood , combat ) rather trauma cumulative experience . It unlikely able find subject never experience trauma , include death love one , parental separation , natural disaster , crime , etc . Therefore , initially recruit control without regard trauma level . Following recruitment first ten subject , trauma score review . If control group endorse low level trauma , direct recruitment towards group least one selfreport significant lifetime trauma 50 percent control population least one significant lifetime traumatic event . Only Englishspeaking subject include . Several study questionnaire available English . In addition , study exploratory require induction anxiety . The investigator TSMC believe prudent assure subject able communicate easily staff fMRI stress induction . Subjects recruit subject request treatment alcohol dependence Dallas VA subject see NIH . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : AlcoholDependent Subjects : Primary psychoactive dependence disorder alcohol , except nicotine caffeine . Active diagnosis Axis I Schizophrenia , Mood , Anxiety Disorders ( except PTSD ) . Use medication know significantly affect HPA axis function neural activity , include psychotropics previous two week ( four week fluoxetine ) . Use medication know significantly affect HPA axis function neural activity , include psychotropics previous two week ( four week fluoxetine ) . Patients concomitantly use anxiolytic , antidepressant , opioids , lithium , anticonvulsant , sedative/hypnotics , buspirone , beta blocker , alpha adrenergic drug , steroid , beta agonist , clonidine , dopamine agonist , naltrexone , acamprosate , disulfiram exclude study . Any medical condition might affect HPA axis function possibly endanger patient 's health behavioral stability . Medical condition might limit cooperation ( e.g . dementia ) put patient medical risk ( i.e . significant hematologic , hepatic , renal , cardiovascular pathology ) exclude . Patients past present neurologic disorder ( i.e . head trauma loss consciousness require hospitalization , transient ischemic attack , stroke , tumor , etc . ) exclude . Healthy Controls : Lifetime history DSM IV Substance Use Disorder ( except Nicotine Caffeine Dependence ) Axis I disorder . One firstdegree family member substance use disorder ( nicotine ) . Medical , psychiatric , medication exclusion describe alcohol dependent patient .</criteria>
