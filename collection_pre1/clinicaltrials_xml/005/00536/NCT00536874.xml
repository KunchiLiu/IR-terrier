	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving chemotherapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give gemcitabine together oxaliplatin work treat patient pancreatic cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Oxaliplatin Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine overall 18-month survival patient radiographically resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma treat neoadjuvant gemcitabine oxaliplatin follow surgical resection adjuvant gemcitabine . Secondary - To determine safety , toxicity , feasibility regimen neoadjuvant setting . - To determine feasibility obtain preoperative core tissue biopsy ability use biopsy establish pathologic correlate response follow neoadjuvant therapy determine xenograft develop core tissue . - To determine specific tumor marker response ( CEA CA19-9 ) neoadjuvant therapy . - To determine prognostic accuracy serum protein profile patient . - To determine overall survival pattern tumor recurrence ( local v distant ) . OUTLINE : - Neoadjuvant therapy : Patients receive gemcitabine IV 100 minute oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Surgery : Within 2-6 week completion neoadjuvant therapy , patient undergo laparoscopy include pancreaticoduodenectomy distal pancreatectomy without splenectomy . - Adjuvant therapy : Beginning 4-16 week surgery , patient receive gemcitabine IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo tumor tissue blood sample collection periodically correlative study . Samples analyze protein expression tumor marker ( CEA CA19-9 ) pre- post-neoadjuvant therapy via proteomic analysis . Tumor tissue sample also bank research purpose . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
