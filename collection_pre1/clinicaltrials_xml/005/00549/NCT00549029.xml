	<brief_title>The Association Genetic Polymorphisms With Statin-Induced Myopathy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Statins widely prescribe patient hypercholesterolemia . Though efficacy prevent cardiovascular event show large number clinical trial , myotoxic side effect include myopathy even severe , rhabdomyolysis associate use statin . Because incidence myopathy various among individual , polymorphism gene suppose main factor . Due single nucleotide polymorphism relate gene , level uptake , clearance metabolism statins seriously different among individual result various occurrence myopathy . Therefore , analytical study association SNP statins-related gene incidence myopathy critical research apply clinical field .</detailed_description>
