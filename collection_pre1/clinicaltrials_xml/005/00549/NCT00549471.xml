	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : ( 1 ) Treating upper limb hypertonia/spasticity Botox速 , addition reduce hypertonia/spasticity , ( ) improve global development , ( b ) improve function ( passive &amp; active ) , ( c ) reduce carer burden ( ) improve quality life . ( 2 ) Early treatment Botox速 great impact rate global development compare late treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improvement After Botulinum Toxin Injections Arms Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Upper limb function essential activity daily live impact quality life child cerebral palsy ( CP ) . In preschool child , dysfunctional upper extremity manipulation lead disability may delay global development substantially increase career burden . Even modest functional improvement could tremendous long-term benefit activity daily live significantly reduce career burden . Hypertonia main symptom cause motor dysfunction CP . Intramuscular Botulinum toxin injection one way treatment . In spite anecdotal evidence suggest early intervention lead well outcome , Israeli physician unable prescribe treatment upper extremity due limit health insurance coverage . A paucity research evidence often cite reason limit insurance coverage , particular upper limb . We therefore propose study effect Botox速 treat child CP . Method : Twenty cooperative quadriplegic CP child age 8-11 year , gross motor function level 4 , enrol study . Inclusion criteria troublesome hypertonia respond treatment Botox速 ( identify clinical assessment neurophysiological measure ) . Since cooperation crucial intensive therapy child cognitive impairment ( IQ &lt; 70 ) severe behavioural disorder exclude . The child randomize one two group Botox group ( BG ) control group ( CG ) . CG child undergo program intensive therapy BG child give Botox , clinically require , addition equivalent program intensive therapy . Botox injection tailor accord specific child . Generally injection site include biceps brachioradialis , flexor wrist digit inject accord abnormal posture function . Maximal total dose 23 IU per kg . The intensive therapy clinically required therapy program fully document . Outcome measure include follow : 1 . Hypertonia- neurophysiological measure 2 . Impairment measure - Grip Pinch strength , active passive range motion writs elbow shoulder 3 . Upper extremity function - Quality Upper Extremity Skills Test ( QUEST ) , Box Blocks test 4 . Function patient need assessment - Goal Attainment Scores , Developmental Fine Motor Scale , Pediatric Evaluation Disability Inventory ( PEDI ) 5 . Quality life scale ( care comfort hypertonicity questionnaire ) All measure take treatment repeat 7 month , 13 month treatment .</detailed_description>
