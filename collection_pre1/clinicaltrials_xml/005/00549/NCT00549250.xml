	<brief_title>Human Papillomavirus 6/11 Lower Airway Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Juvenile onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis ( JORRP ) cause human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , almost exclusively type 6 11 . The disease well-known recurrence difficulty management . The peak incidence around 2-3 year age . Since HPV infection always consider sexual transmitted disease , rate vertical perinatal transmission study extensively . However , study focus HPV 6 11 . To best knowledge , several large-scale study available HPV infection newborn , case HPV 6/11 infection identify . Most study specimens take oral cavity newborn . In contrast occurrence JORRP larynx , trachea low respiratory tract , vertical transmission HPV 6/11 exist , specimens low respiratory tract newborn mandatory detect possible infection . There study available HPV 6/11 infection low airway healthy neonate/children . In study adult , prevalence HPV 6/11 larynx vocal cord patient without recurrent respiratory papillomatosis range 19~25 % . In contrast , several study specimen take non-disease low airway ( trachea , vocal cord ) and/or larynx patient JORRP . Except almost 100 % presence HPV 6/11 DNA diseased site , 38~60 % specimen take non-disease site also positive viral DNA , show latent infection infrequent normal airway , may later cause active disease mechanism still unknown date . The large national registry JORRP date conduct US 603 case . The study show significant association young age diagnosis papilloma occur larynx ( mean age 4.6 VS 2.1 year , p=0.009 ) . This finding emphasize importance get specimen laryngeal level , especially neonates . The aim study examine presence HPV 6/11 DNA low respiratory tract specimens newborn . To get low respiratory tract specimen without unnecessary medical intervention , need intubation include study . Specimens bronchial lavage ( scrap ? ) obtain get informed consent parent , undergo PCR identify presence HPV 6/11 DNA .</detailed_description>
