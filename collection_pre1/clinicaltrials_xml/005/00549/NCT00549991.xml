	<brief_title>Analyzing Genes That May Increase Risk Developing High Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High blood pressure affect nearly one third individual United States . It especially common African Americans , 40 % African Americans diagnosed condition . High blood pressure usually develop early life severe African Americans racial ethnic group . Many factor cause high blood pressure , include stress , diet , diabetes , kidney disease , obesity . Previous study also show genetic variation two region chromosomes 6 21 may predispose people develop high blood pressure . Admixture map type genetic analysis aim identify disease-causing genetic variation across different population people . Using admixture mapping , study examine previously collect genetic sample African American participant Family Blood Pressure Program ( FBPP ) study African American , Mexican American , Nigerian , Jamaican participant enrol clinical study . Study researcher analyze sample identify characterize genetic variation associate increase risk high blood pressure African American population , well racial ethnic group .</detailed_description>
