	<brief_title>Clinical Study Aneurysm Exclusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Arizona Heart Institute respectfully submit protocol feasibility study utilize endoluminal graft construct PTFE encapsulate nitinol stent . The study intend evaluate use unique device treatment aortic aneurysmal disease . The stent graft make laminate PTFE `` jacket '' around nitinol stent act structural fixation support . Both material extensive history use various type implant device . CT scan angiography 3D computer imaging , possibly IVUS image use choose site placement device assure precise deployment . In comparison conventional surgical approach , endoluminal stent-graft technique repair abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAAs ) offer advantage minimally invasive procedure lower morbidity perhaps cost reduction . The Arizona Heart Institute long history area endoluminal grafting treatment aneurysms occlusive disease . Endoluminal sleeve principally use ePTFE stainless steel nitinol stent structure study use commercially available material customize particular pathologic situation . As technology advance however , sophisticated engineering beyond capability institution require . The propose project originate potential escalate combination ePTFE stents high level performance aneurysm exclusion procedure . Current data reflect several deficiency approve exclusion device . Migration , type I , II III endoleaks continual aneurysm expansion clear predictor potential rupture . Increased complication associated initial peri-procedural deployment device release broad scale observe . In order address problem , Arizona Heart Institute engage EndoMed engineering design endoluminal graft repair abdominal aortic aneurysm . We believe result positive step forward technology exclude aneurysmal disease less invasively . The endoluminal stent-graft compose multiple nitinol stent encapsulate expanded Polytetrafluoroethylene ( ePTFE ) . The stent compose Z-shaped , perform nitinol wire , crimp together stainless steel sleeve form circular frame graft . This frame encapsulate two thin sheet laminate PTFE . The proximal end endoluminal stent-graft make two configuration . One completely encapsulate graft PTFE cover entire device . The open stent segment ( bare wire configuration ) allow open stent region graft place across orifice renal , mesenteric , internal iliac artery without obstruct antegrade blood flow . The device available straight tube , aortomonoiliac bifurcate design . Once endoluminal stent graft build , 4 French guidewire dilator place center graft assembly compress high density polyethylene ( HDPE ) cartridge ease intraluminal delivery . The endoluminal stent-graft place two Tyvek pouch sterilize use Hydrogen Peroxide . Subjects undergo evaluation PTFE encapsulation Nitinol stent provide data device 's feasibility therapeutic clinical use . Follow-up complete 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month . Subject evaluation 1 month include Complete History Physical , Bilateral ABIs , Abdominal Duplex Ultrasound , KUB X-ray ( 4 view ) . Subject evaluation 6 month also include Complete History Physical , Bilateral ABIs , Abdominal Duplex Ultrasound , KUB X-ray ( 4 view ) , base duplex ultrasound Abdominal CT scan without IV contrast 2.5 mm Labs ( BUN/Creatinine ) . Subject evaluation 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month include Complete History Physical , Bilateral ABIs , Abdominal CT scan without IV contrast 2.5 mm , Abdominal Duplex Ultrasound , KUB X-ray ( 4 view ) , Labs ( BUN/Creatinine ) .</detailed_description>
