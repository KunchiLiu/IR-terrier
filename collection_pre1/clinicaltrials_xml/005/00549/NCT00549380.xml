	<detailed_description>The primary objective study examine feasibility expand application basic Endologix technology treatment arterial aneurysmal disease . A second objective study gather data order make logical , scientific recommendation device design , construction application expand application endoluminal graft technology improve safety efficacy expand several potential future positive aspect less invasive method treat arterial occlusive disease . Endologix , Inc. apply receive IDE investigation bifurcate device exclude aneurysms abdominal aorta . The Arizona Heart Institute experience indicate small study design prove successful . Using basic technology current approve IDE , Arizona Heart Institute 's intention expand scope application design order address great population basis suffer aneurysmal disease . In regard , basic Endologix device design apply appropriate patient beyond scope current bifurcate IDE . Patients meet criterion Endologix IDE enrol independently study follow precisely order comply study design . Patients aneurysmal disease currently fill criterion bifurcate abdominal aortic prosthetic could potentially benefit technology exclude aneurysmal disease consider study . The patient 's participation Study include enrollment , Investigational Device procedure follow-up period . Patient data collect 1 , 6 , 12 month beyond indicate . Subject follow-up 1 month include ; ABIs , complete Physical Examination , Duplex Ultrasound , X-ray . Subject follow-up 6 12 month also include ABIs , complete Physical Examination , CT Scan-Contrast Enhanced ( unless contraindicate ) , CT Scan-No Contrast , X-ray .</detailed_description>
