	<detailed_description>Balance reaction involve rapidly step reach grasp handrail object support play crucial role prevent u fall lose balance . However , recover balance successfully , central nervous system able control step grasp movement deal `` environmental constraint '' ( i.e . object architectural feature obstruct step serve handhold grasp ) , hence must somehow monitor location potential constraint move daily live . The need monitor environmental feature suggest critical role visual attention , gaze control , spatial memory , know decline age . Although study examine effect balance control , know deficit impair motor behavior drive successfully counter use computer-based `` visual training '' intervention design improve ability rapidly extract information peripheral visual field ( so-called `` Useful Field View '' , UFOV ) . The propose research use analogous approach improve balance control . Specifically , test whether : 1 ) UFOV® computer-based visual-training program commercially available video game lead improved ability use peripheral vision monitor change spatial feature surround environment , 2 ) whether change visual processing associate improved ability rapidly reach grasp handrail support , response sudden unpredictable balance perturbation . Older adult document deficit UFOV score randomly assign either visual training ( UFOV video game ) control group . Each training group undergo two one-hour session per week , five consecutive week . Neither group give information train method expect beneficial . Participants experimental group complete either computerized UFOV® speed-of-processing intervention video game training intervention . This UFOV intervention focus ability quickly identify locate visual target present ( brief time interval ) central peripheral visual field . The training challenge participant identify target ( ) brief display duration possible , within increasingly difficult task condition . Difficulty train task increase make difficult identify central target , decrease duration target presentation time , increase number task complete simultaneously , add distracters , increase eccentricity ( visual angle ) peripheral target . Participants video game train group participate game play session use cartoon-based action video game increase level challenge difficulty . Participants control group complete time computerized word puzzle train session . This cognitive task involve level social interaction computer use similar experimental group , expect yield improvement ability rapidly process peripheral visuospatial information . Balance assessment perform immediately completion intervention program . Balance perturbation deliver use large ( 2x2m ) computer-controlled motion platform . Subjects stand center platform motor-driven moveable handhold system mount front wall platform . In trial , handhold ( 10cm rod ) control move , intermittently unpredictably , back forth along horizontal axis frontal plane , come rest one four final location ( correspond visual angle 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 degree ) . The move platform deliver small perturbation second final handhold location reach . Subjects tell grasp handhold quickly possible response platform motion . During trial , subject perform concurrent visual vigilance task , require continuously look straight ahead center computer screen . This task design ensure subject rely peripheral vision acquire spatial information need direct hand toward handhold follow onset platform perturbation . The absence eye movement toward grasp location confirm via recording head-mounted eye tracker . A motion-analysis system use determine speed accuracy grasp reaction .</detailed_description>
