	<brief_title>Effect Macrolide Antibiotics Airway Inflammation People With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD disease lung airways partly damage obstruct , make difficult breathe . The common cause cigarette smoking , breathe type lung irritant , include pollution , dust , chemical , long period time may also contribute COPD . It fourth lead cause death United States . Symptoms include cough , excess mucus production , shortness breath , wheeze , chest tightness . Some bacterial infection may worsen COPD exacerbation . Current study examine macrolide antibiotic azithromycin may beneficial reduce frequency and/or severity COPD exacerbation . Azithromycin also anti-inflammatory property may reduce severity COPD exacerbation inhibit matrix metalloprotease ( MMP ) -catalyzed breakdown collagen subsequent generation PGP , substance produce response collagen breakdown . An increase PGP level may indicate increase inflammation , worsen COPD symptom . NHLBI 's COPD Network Macrolide study include people COPD randomly assign receive either azithromycin placebo 1 year . For current study , researcher examine Macrolide participant ' previously collect blood sample , sputum sample , study data , include information COPD exacerbation azithromycin effect . The purpose study examine anti-inflammatory property azithromycin people COPD .</detailed_description>
