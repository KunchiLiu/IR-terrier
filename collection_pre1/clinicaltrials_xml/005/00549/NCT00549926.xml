	<detailed_description>Previous mega trial demonstrate lipid lower therapy HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor ( statin ) reduce incidence major cardiovascular event one-third , thus , benefit lipid lower therapy substantiate . Such benefit significant especially patient coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . The third report National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel ( NCEP ATP-III ) suggest advantage intensive lipid lower therapy goal reduce LDL-C 70 mg/dL patient categorize high risk . In Japan , Japan Atherosclerosis Society ( JAS ) Guidelines Diagnosis Treatment Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases 2002 recommend LDL-C goal patient coronary heart disease 100 mg/dL . However , satisfactory evidence whether need low LDL-C level le 70mg/dL Japanese population . Recently , research diagnosis coronary plaque show significant advance . The REVERSAL study patient history CHD , diagnosis intravascular ultrasound , suggest intensive lipid lower therapy atorvastatin ( 80 mg/day ) associate growth plaque ( -0.4 % compare baseline ) , whereas therapy pravastatin ( 40 mg/day ) show slight increase ( 2.7 % ) plaque volume 18 month Western population . In Japanese population , MEGA study show effect moderate lipid lower therapy primary prevention cardiovascular event . However , effect moderate lipid lower therapy secondary prevention cardiovascular event unknown . Pravastatin fluvastatin statin administer Japan several year . Although LDL-C lower effect statins less strong new generation statin , safeｔｙ profile well establish . Fluvastatin expect reduce coronary plaque high affinity arterial tissue antioxygenic effect compare pitavastatin , effect human coronary plaque report . Relative plaque regression rate intensive moderate lipid lowering therapy would clarify ideal level target LDL-C Japanese population . Furthermore , different effect coronary plaque pravastatin fluvastatin similar LDL-C lowering effect different affinity arterial tissue would determine superior lipid lower regimen affect coronary plaque volume .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients diagnose acute coronary syndrome , successful percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) perform intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) guidance . 2 . Patients coronary plaque ( ≧ 500 µm thickness % plaque 20 % ≧ 5 mm distal proximal previously treat area branch coronary artery . 3 . Patients hypercholesterolemia define follow criterion : TC ≧ 220 mg/dL LDLC ≧ 140 mg/dL Cholesterollowering treatment allow accord investigator 's judgement LDLC ≧ 100 mg/dL TC ≧ 180 mg/dL . 4 . Patients write consent volition provide sufficient explanation participation clinical trial . 5 . Patients 20 year old time consent . 1 . Patients bypass graft instent restenosis site PCI . 2 . Patients receive PCI past lesion evaluation coronary plaque volume plan . 3 . Patients plaques nonculprit site might receive PCI treatment period . 4 .
