	<brief_summary>Angioplasty procedure open blocked heart artery use balloon and/or stent . Most U.S. state national heart organization require angioplasty do hospital also perform open heart surgery . The reason risk angioplasty cause injury heart artery might require open heart surgery fix . Open heart surgery backup case need . The risk open heart surgery need small . Nevertheless , without research , many state Departments Health national heart organization want change requirement on-site open heart surgery wherever angioplasty perform . Some States already allow ; European heart organization already allow , well . This study design determine whether safety benefit angioplasty hospital perform angioplasty either without open heart surgery backup . Patient enter study heart catheterization hospital without heart surgery program . If need angioplasty , randomize either stay hospital without heart surgery angioplasty transfer procedure hospital heart surgery . For every four patient , three stay hospital without heart surgery one transfer . The study design show detectable difference safety benefit procedure two type hospital ( without heart surgery ) . The cost procedure two hospital type also compare .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Precatheterization : Must undergo diagnostic cardiac catheterization suspect CAD Be least 18 year age Must pregnant ( negative pregnancy test ) must childbearing potential must able give informed consent . Postcatheterization : Coronary artery disease judge clinically angiographically significant Ability perform PCI equipment available local site Procedure risk judge high ( see ) Precatheterization : Inability give inform consent STsegment elevation myocardial infarction Pregnancy Postcatheterization : High likelihood require device available hospital without SOS No need PCI Need coronary artery bypass surgery High procedural risk ( see ) High procedural risk criterion : PCI unprotected leave main coronary artery PCI leave circulation lesion presence critical ( &gt; 70 % ) unprotected left main coronary artery lesion Poor leave ventricular function ( EF &lt; 20 % ) need perform PCI vessel supply significant myocardium</criteria>
