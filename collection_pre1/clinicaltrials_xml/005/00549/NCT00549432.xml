	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate TALENT endoluminal stent-graft system patient abdominal aortic aneurysm . The TALENT endoluminal stent-graft system flexible , implantable endoluminal vascular device preloaded placement system use exclude abdominal aortic aneurysm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Exclusion ( TALENT Abdominal )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An aneurysm localize dilatation blood vessel least 1 1/2 2 time normal vessel diameter . Abdominal aortic aneurysm relatively common , detected 1.3 % 2.7 % patient 65 80 year age ( Blum , et al , 1996 ; Collins , Araujo , Lindsell , 1988 ; Scott , Ashton , Kay , 1991 ) . A large proportion ( 50 % ) patient untreated AAAs experience rupture exsanguination ( Johansen , 1995 ) . Ruptured AAAs 13th lead cause death US , account 15,000 death per year ( Cronenwett Sampson , 1995 ) . Conventional treatment abdominal aortic aneurysm surgical procedure involve midline laparotomy , aortic clamping , aortic bypass , blood loss associate transfusion . Improvements surgical technique patient care allow mortality rate associate procedure reduce approximately 5 % , elective repair do prior rupture aneurysm . Risks surgery increase patient consider poor candidate surgery . Due progress make interventional radiology endovascular surgery , possible treat aneurysm without abdominal surgical procedure , thus potentially reduce risk associate elective repair . This new therapeutic approach consist transfemoral introduction metallic stent couple vascular graft . When stent device deploy expand within aneurysmal blood vessel , create new aortic lumen blood flow , effectively exclude aneurysm sac flow maintain perfusion low limb . This less invasive technique design prevent need laparotomy , reduce need blood transfusion , decrease use anesthetic drug , speed recovery time . The objective study evaluate safety effectiveness TALENT endoluminal stent-graft system patient may categorize standard risk , high risk indication . Standard risk patient patient indication treatment consistent manufacturer IDE , active enrollment IDE . High risk patient patient meet entrance criterion manufacturer sponsor IDE high risk morbidity mortality standard surgical repair . Other indication would consider patient indication treatment outside manufacturer sponsor IDE . This study perform high risk low risk patient consider good candidate endoluminal repair abdominal aortic aneurysm . Patients heparinized implant procedure activate clotting time 300 second achieve . During implantation TALENT endoluminal stent-graft , pre-implant CT scan available angiogram use together ( on-the-table ) digital subtraction angiography ( DSA ) , roadmapping , angiography proper implant positioning . The TALENT endoluminal stent-graft endoprosthesis insert delivery catheter introducer sheath via surgical cutdown ( e.g. , external iliac artery , femoral artery ) approach . The introducer sheath delivery catheter contain stent-graft inserted guidewire advance aorta aneurysm . With delivery catheter correct position , push rod hold stationary outer sheath slowly withdrawn . The introducer sheath withdrawn stent-graft completely deploy . The balloon may inflate along full length implant device model spring vessel wall unravel possible wrinkle graft fabric . After deployment stent-graft , angiography perform verify implant position check presence endoleaks . Subjects undergo evaluation TALENT endoluminal stent-graft determine safety efficacy device indicate adverse event rate , determine risk factor predictive successful outcome use exclude abdominal aortic aneurysm require suprarenal fixation high risk low risk patient . Follow-up complete 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month . Subject evaluation 1 month include complete Physical Examination , Bilateral ABIs , Duplex Ultrasound ( previously complete time discharge ) . Subject evaluation 6 month also include Complete Physical Examination , Bilateral ABIs , Duplex Ultrasound , Abdominal X-ray ( AP , Lateral , 2 Obliques ) . Subject evaluation 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month include Complete Physical Examination , Bilateral ABIs , Abdominal X-ray ( AP , Lateral , 2 Obliques ) , Spiral CT scan without IV Contrast 2.5mm .</detailed_description>
