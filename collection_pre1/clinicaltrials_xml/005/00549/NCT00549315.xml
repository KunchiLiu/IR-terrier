	<brief_title>Clinical Study Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm Exclusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A vascular aneurysm permanent , localize dilatation blood vessel least 1 1/2 2 time normal vessel diameter . The aorta frequent site aneurysm , approximately 10 % aortic aneurysm locate renal artery thoracic segment . Thoracic aortic aneurysm ( TAAs ) less common abdominal aorta , however , detection TAAs increasing , perhaps due age population , increase diagnostic capability increase prevalence . Untreated thoracic aneurysms life-threatening . As many 78 % untreated patient TAA die within 5 year diagnosis , often rupture aneurysm . Conventional surgical treatment , either tube graft placement patch aortoplasty , high risk surgical procedure . Repair thoracic descend aorta perform thoracotomy cross-clamping aorta , without shunt by-pass maintain distal perfusion . As alternative conventional surgery , less invasive endovascular procedure develop may use treat certain aneurysm . A collapsed stent-graft , metal stent couple fabric graft , introduced vasculature , advance size aneurysm , deploy span aneurysm . The device create new aortic lumen , exclude aneurysm sac blood flow maintain flow within stent-graft . This less invasive technique design prevent decrease need open surgery , reduce need blood transfusion , decrease use anesthetic drug , speed recovery time . A reduction intensive care total hospital stay result , lead increase quality life follow procedure reduction cost . The primary objective investigational plan determine safety Valiant endoluminal device use exclude thoracic lesion : true descend thoracic aortic aneurysm , dissection , penetrate ulcer , traumatic transections traumatic degenerative pseudoaneurysms blood flow high risk low risk patient candidate endoluminal repair . Patients heparinized implant procedure ( recommend activate clotting time 200-300 second ) . During implantation Valiant endoluminal stent-graft , pre-implant angiogram CT scan use together ( on-the-table ) intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) , digital subtraction angiography ( DAS ) , roadmapping , angiography proper implant positioning . The Valiant endoluminal stent-graft endoprosthesis insert delivery catheter introducer sheath via surgical cutdown ( e.g. , external iliac artery , femoral artery , common iliac artery conduit , etc . ) approach . The introducer sheath delivery catheter contain stent-graft inserted guidewire advance aorta aneurysm . With delivery catheter correct position , introducer sheath withdrawn stent-graft completely deploy . A separate stent-graft balloon catheter system provide device may use along full length implant device model spring vessel wall unravel possible wrinkle graft fabric . After deployment stent-graft , angiography perform verify implant position check presence endoleaks . Subjects undergo evaluation Valiant endoluminal stent-graft determine safety efficacy device indicate adverse event rate , determine risk factor predictive successful outcome use exclude thoracic aortic aneurysm require suprarenal fixation high risk low risk patient . Follow-up complete 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month . Subject evaluation 1 month include Complete Physical Exam , Labs ( BUN Creatinine ) , Thoracic Spiral CT without IV contrast 2.5 mm . Subject evaluation 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month include Complete Physical Exam , Chest X-ray ( AP , Lateral ) , Labs ( BUN Creatinine ) , Thoracic Spiral CT without IV contrast 2.5 mm .</detailed_description>
