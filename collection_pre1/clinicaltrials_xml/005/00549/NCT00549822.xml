	<brief_summary>The purpose research study study effect use aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) therapy intermittently participant breast cancer . AIs class drug use treat breast cancer postmenopausal woman . They work decrease level estrogen , believe stimulate growth tumor tissue . Breast cancer progress despite therapy AI think become resistant AI therapy . There scientific evidence suggest resistant breast cancer cell learn grow low level estrogen present AI therapy , increase estrogen level even slightly stop AI therapy may inhibit breast cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- This study involve treat participant intermittent AI therapy . The AI stop time enter study . We plan monitor marker participant blood call CA 15-3 ( CA 27.29 ) every 4 week help u make decision re-start treatment letrozole ( femara ) . This marker know rise disease progress drop disease respond treatment . We stop re-starting therapy base change CA 15-3 participant blood . - In addition bloodwork , follow test procedure perform monthly basis : medical history ; physical examination performance status . - Every 8 week follow perform : Tumor assessment physical exam ( possible ) ; Chest x-ray CT scan chest ; CT scan abdomen pelvis ; bone scan .</detailed_description>
