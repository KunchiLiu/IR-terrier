	<brief_summary>The Bifurcated PowerLink System intend provide permanent alternative conduit blood flow within patient 's abdominal vascular system , exclude aneurysmal sac blood flow pressure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abdominal Aortic/Aorto-Iliac Aneurysm Endoluminal Graft Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An arterial anuerysm permanent , localize dilatation artery increase diameter ≥ 50 % large normal artery . Although artery may develop aneurysm , commonly see abdominal aorta , thoracic aorta , popliteal artery common iliac artery . The use intravascular stent endoluminal graft exclude natural arterial aneurysm treat occlusive vascular lesion evaluate number preclinical study . Endovascular stent graft implantation obviates need abdominal surgery use peripheral artery route aneurysm , stent provide mean graft attachment suture . The goal endoluminal grafting conventional repair allow insertion resilient conduit end aneurysm exclude circulation prevent rupture aneurysm . This Phase 2 Clinical Study Bifurcated PowerLink System ( Endoluminal Graft ) treatment abdominal infrarenal aorto-iliac aneurysmal disease ( AAA ) . Diagnostic image method Spiral CT Scans , angiography , ultrasound fluoroscopy image use choose site placement device assure precise deployment . The Delivery Catheter allow endovascular placement Device ( endoluminal graft ) via either retrograde ( femoral iliac artery ) antegrade ( brachial artery ) approach . The Endoluminal Graft ( ELG ) self-expanding metal alloy stent cage , cover outside thin wall ePTPE graft material . The graft material fully support throughout entire ELG length . The ELG also available bifurcate configuration . The bifurcated delivery catheter available various diameter work length . The catheter consist introducer sheath homeostatic vavle inner shaft . The inner shaft obturator taper tip connect rear obturator mean hypotube . The main body ELG compress around hypotube load Delivery Catheter . The contralateral ipsilateral limb ELG compress respective limb cover loaded Delivery Catheter . The inner shaft accommodate standard .035 inch guidewire . The concurrent surgical control test patient ' participation Study include enrollment , Investigational Device procedure surgical repair follow-up period . Patient data collect : pre-operative , operative post-operative follow-up discharge 1 month . Long term follow-up concurrent surgical control test patient continue 6 12 month support PMA . Extended follow-up may require Investigational Device approve PMA , 5 year follow-up Post Market Surveillance requirement .</detailed_description>
