	<detailed_description>TRP ( treatment relate pneumonitis ) inflammation ( irritated injure tissue ) lungs occurs result chemotherapy radiation therapy . TRP occur chemotherapy radiation affect normal lung tissue tumor treat . 3D CRT current standard care . It deliver radiation several different angle body center focus tumor ( ) . Because deliver different angle , amount radiation contact tumor ( ) also contact normal lung tissue angle . IMRT new type radiation therapy . It also deliver radiation several different angle body center focus tumor ( ) . The difference amount treatment angle adjust accord shape size tumor ( ) , turn may decrease radiation exposure normal lung tissue angle . Researchers want find intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) able decrease amount normal lung affect treat lung cancer . Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . You blood draw ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . You ask medical problem may could cause development TRP . You test include compute tomography ( CT ) scan , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan , lung function test . A PET scan scan show cell take high level type sugar ( glucose ) , cancer cell . Before scan , small dose slightly radioactive form glucose injected vein . The cell take high amount glucose show good scan . The scan process quite similar regular CT scan . No new biopsy need ; original biopsy use study . You 2 different single photon-emission compute tomography test ( SPECTs ) . You lung single-photon emission computerize tomography ( SPECT ) test show area blood flow normal lung . You heart single-photon emission computerize tomography ( SPECT ) test show area blood flow heart . To perform single-photon emission computerize tomography ( SPECT ) test , slightly radioactive substance inject vein image see blood flow lung heart . This help study doctor try avoid use radiation angle would go normal blood flow area . You also biopsy tumor tissue . To perform tumor biopsy , area body ( tumor present ) numb anesthetic , small amount tumor tissue withdrawn large needle forceps ( tong-like instrument ) endoscopic ( view body cavity special instrument ) exam . Researchers use result test learn stage ( size location ) cancer see tumor ( ) treat radiation . Women able child must blood urine pregnancy test , perform blood urine collect routine test . To eligible take part study , pregnancy test must negative . If find eligible take part study , radiation doctor first conduct planning session . You CT scan chest , respiratory ( breathe ) motion monitor . After scan do , radiation doctor evaluate make outline tumor ( ) lung . The CT scan help doctor identify ( note difference ) tumor ( ) normal surround tissue . The planning session help radiation doctor decide target area ( ) , best angle deliver radiation , effective radiation dose ( also intend decrease radiation surround normal tissue ) treatment . If plan treatment consider acceptable radiation doctor , randomly assign ( toss coin ) 1 2 treatment group . Participants one group receive 3D CRT . Participants group receive intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) . You equal chance either one group . If assign receive intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) , total radiation dose tumor ( ) slightly high participant receive 3D CRT . If 3D CRT plan treatment consider acceptable ( usually large target area ) radiation doctor , treat IMRT , without amifostine . Amifostine drug give injection protect normal lung esophagus tissue radiation side effect injury . Your treat physician decide need amifostine , base size tumor tissue normal tissue radiation `` field '' ( area give radiation treatment ) . If need amifostine , nurse give injection 30 minute radiation treatment . Your blood pressure check 15-20 minute injection . Participants study receive standard chemotherapy give together radiation therapy . The standard chemotherapy usually include cisplatin , carboplatin , paclitaxel , docetaxel . The chemotherapy consider investigational part study . All study participant receive standard chemotherapy , give together radiation therapy . The standard chemotherapy usually include cisplatin , carboplatin , paclitaxel , and/or docetaxel . Your chemotherapy doctor explain side effect chemotherapy drug start receive chemotherapy . The chemotherapy investigational part clinical trial . Participants group receive total 6 Â½ week radiation therapy ( day 5 day week ) . You treat weekend national holiday . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study . After complete therapy study , follow-up visit . The study doctor check disease respond treatment use image scan blood test ( 1 tablespoon time ) perform screen portion study . These test perform every 3-4 month completion treatment part standard care . This investigational study . Both 3D conformal radiation therapy ( CRT ) intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) FDA approve treatment cancer . Up 168 patient take part study . All enrol M.D . Anderson .</detailed_description>
