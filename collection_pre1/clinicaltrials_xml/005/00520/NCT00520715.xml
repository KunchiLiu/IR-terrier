	<brief_summary>Emergence bacterial resistance antibiotic , major public health issue , appear involve predominantly commensal flora . No data exist concern risk factor carriage fluoroquinolone resistant bacteria flora hospitalise patient . We conduct prospective open study include unselected patient hospitalise medical ward one hospital . Nasal , pharyngeal rectal swab perform upon admission well review potential risk factor , patient 's information acceptance . Resistance test aim 3 pathogen ( Staphylococcus , Streptococcus E. coli ) perform specimen , case control study compare risk factor resistant non-resistant group , pathogen . A thousand patient include year 's time . This work could help understand risk factor involve carriage fluoroquinolone resistant pathogen , potentially responsible invasive infection inter-patient transmission resistance . Limiting bacterial resistance transmission goal successfully undertaken resistance mechanism , also risk factor acquire resistant bacteria well understood .</brief_summary>
