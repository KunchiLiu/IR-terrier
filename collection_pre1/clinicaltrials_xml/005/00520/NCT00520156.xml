	<brief_summary>There well-documented poorly understood relationship headache disorder ( e.g . migraine , cluster headache , awaken headache , etc . ) sleep disorder . One hypothesis include underlying disorder know obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) low overnight oxygen saturation possibly elevate carbon dioxide level result awaken headache . Bruxism , grind teeth , also anecdotally associate headache . The converse argument patient may primary headache disorder , example migraine , lead disordered sleep pattern insomnia . The true relationship two , allude , unknown . The actual prevalence two disorder occur simultaneously know . There several small , retrospective study attempt evaluate relationship . One study evaluate patient diagnosed OSA give standard care therapy - continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) - find headache among patient improve use CPAP . Again , small , retrospective study . We propose study whereby patient refer polysomnography ( PSG , `` sleep study '' ) consent , survey presence absence headache . A brief questionnaire follow detailed questionnaire characterize whether headache patient truly headache disorder . Following survey PSG , patient 's sleep study parameter evaluate see whether certain correlation record particular headache disorder present . Lastly , patient diagnose OSA fit CPAP device , patient query several week later evaluate whether improvement cessation headache disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Prevalence Characteristics Concomitant Sleep Headache Disorders , Efficacy CPAP Treatment Headache Among Those Patients Diagnosed With Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There well-documented poorly understood relationship headache disorder ( e.g . migraine , cluster headache , awaken headache , etc . ) sleep disorder . The exact prevalence patient concomitant headache disorder sleep disorder even know . Hypotheses surround relationship include low overnight oxygen saturation and/or hypercarbia case obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) awaken headache , primary headache disorder contributor secondary sleep disorder , atypical length percentage time various sleep stage result disordered sleep pattern subsequent headache , bruxism cause tension type headache , among others . Our review literature show yet prospective trial evaluate headache disorder concomitant sleep disorder attempt find vagaries abnormality term sleep parameter way explain headache disorder . Additionally , although retrospective review small number patient examine intervention ( case , addition continuous positive airway pressure - CPAP ) mean correct sleep disorder subsequent evaluation patient 's pre-existing headache disorder , yet prospective trial evaluating . Our team identify least one retrospective study would suggest treat OSA standard care CPAP improve pre-existing symptom headache . Our study propose - obtain consent - survey patient suspect sleep disorder schedule sleep study evaluate overall prevalence headache disorder among particular population . We would evaluate various standard sleep study parameter lowest oxygen saturation , time various sleep stage , sleep latency , total sleep time , respiratory disturbance index , presence bruxism , , see whether correlation certain parameter particular headache disorder . We also would survey patient diagnose OSA follow institution CPAP see whether decrement cessation headache frequency intensity . Being significant proportion patient return war veteran possible traumatic brain injury post-traumatic stress disorder , would also query patient regard presence disorder . These data would take account sub-analysis overall data set . The study 12 month duration . Over 2000 sleep study perform institution 12 month . We anticipate enrollment 400 800 subject .</detailed_description>
