	<brief_summary>To investigate sensitivity [ 18F ] fluoroethylcholine ( FEC ) Positron-Emission-Tomography/ Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( PET/MRI ) method tumour detection location ( side assignment , encapsulation , invasion seminal vesicle ) detection affect lymph node , compare presently use detection procedure ( needle biopsy , digital rectal examination , transrectal ultrasound , pre-therapeutic assessment ) , view find whether [ 18F ] fluoroethylcholine PET/MRI method comparable , superior , establish method .

	<detailed_description>Prostate carcinoma today Germany frequently diagnose cancer disease men - bronchial carcinoma - second frequent cause cancer-related death . Around 22 % new cancer diagnose among male prostate-related . This correspond age-adjusted incidence rate nearly 100 per 100,000 male population , well 40,000 new diagnosis prostate cancer per year [ Robert-Koch-Institut , 2010 ] . The dramatic increase recent decade attributable improve diagnostic method generally increase life expectancy actual increase incidence disease [ Robert-Koch-Institut , 2010 ] . The total annual mortality rate around 11,000 [ Statistisches Bundesamt , 1994 ] . Prostate carcinoma virtually unknown among men 40 year age . The annual prevalence rise increase age - 40th 80th year life factor 1000 . Autopsies show among men 70 80 % latent prostate carcinoma , without fatal [ Breslow 1977 ; Börgemann , 2006 ] . The patient ' average age diagnosis 71 year . The five-year prostate-cancer-specific survival rate diagnosis 80-99 % tumour restrict gland [ Porter , 2006 ] . For disseminated tumour figure considerably small , 35 % [ von Eschenbach , 1996 ] . A prospect complete regression exist non-metastasing carcinoma , quite good : aggressive treatment , 90 % cancer restrict prostate completely cure , 50 % cross gland 's capsule [ Deutsche Gesellschaft für Urologie , 2009 ] . At present , lack adequate pre-therapeutic staging method . This turn often prevent reliable choice stage-adapted therapeutic regimen , could possibly offer good prognosis even carcinomas extend neighbouring organ . A consequence uncertainty individual case therapy ideally suit stage disease , success radiation treatment , hormonal therapy chemotherapy approximately match stage dissemination . Until , reliable method lymph-node diagnosis operative stag lymphadenectomy . No reliable diagnostic method available degree spread tumour within prostate establish . In context , Positron-Emission-Tomography ( PET ) examination radioactively label choline appear offer promise primary imaging-diagnostic staging method , indicated study review . This diagnostic method apply human first describe Gauthier et al . [ 1985 ] . This follow two detailed report Japanese group : Hara et al . [ 1997 ] first investigate potential [ 11C ] choline brain tumour find clear enrichment marker tumours 24 patient , normal brain tissue enrich . In subsequent study group [ Hara , 1998 ] , enrichment fluorodeoxyglucose compare choline uptake lesion ten prostate-cancer patient . Thus , choline enrichment ( SUV , standardise uptake value ) 3.48 ± 1.31 43 lesion , normal environment lesser pelvis correspond value 1.0 . De Jong et al . [ 2003 ] investigate 67 patient , 15 histologically confirm lymph-node metastasis : [ 11C ] choline test give 'true positive ' result 12 15 patient 'false negative ' 3 patient , thus indicate [ 11C ] choline PET sufficiently sensitive specific pre-operative stag lymph-node metastasis prostate carcinoma . In pre-operative staging use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) combine endorectal body-phased-array coil , Pegios et al . [ 2003 ] investigate 42 patient strong clinical suspicion , needle-biopsy confirmation , prostate cancer able differentiate stage extracapsular growth seminal-vesicle infiltration ( tumor stage T2 versus T3 [ T2=tumor restrict gland ; T3a=extracapsule grow tumor ; T3b= tumor infiltration seminal-vesicles ] ) accuracy 94-97 % ( sensitivity 100 % , specificity 87 % 93 % observer 1 2 ) . The exact , local tumour stage identify accuracy 75 % . However , lymph-node infiltration sensitivity 25 % achieve : one four lymph-node-positive patient correctly identify . In recent study , Japanese group [ Yamaguchi , 2005 ] investigate application nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) choline-PET 20 patient needle-biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer . The PET image achieve sensitivity 100 % , NMR ( quotient [ ( creatine + choline ) / citrate ] ) 65 % unsupported MRI 60 % . For 16 patient radical prostatectomy perform ; result correlate pre-operative local stag PET 81 % , MRI 50 % . The site choline uptakes PET visualise MRI use distance prostate femoral head pubic symphysis.At present , data relevant present study indication available software-fused imaging combine PET/MRI . The combination high-resolution endorectal MRI functional PET imaging could come offer decisive advantage stag prostate carcinoma . The present study design test appropriate patient population . A system combine PET MRI recently grant approval U.S.A. U.S. Food Drug Administration [ FDA , 2011 ] .</detailed_description>
