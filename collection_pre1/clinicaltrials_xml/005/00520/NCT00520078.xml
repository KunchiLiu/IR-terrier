	<brief_summary>Acrochordon , soft fibroma , common benign skin tumor generally regard sign cutaneous age reaction friction since occur intertriginous area . Recent study show presence human papillomaviruses , especially mucosal type , intertriginous lesion . This study analyze different clinical presentation acrochordon correlate pathologic molecular human papillomavirus finding . Further goal improve ability differentiate acrochordon possible prevention treatment . Also , may implication transmission prevention cervical carcinoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acrochordon , also call soft fibroma , skin tag fibroepithelial polyp , common cutaneous disorder characterize polypoid growth compose fibroblast loose collagenous stroma , sometimes proliferation blood vessel . They appear soft , skin-colored light brownish skin tumor . Three type lesion may occur , ( 1 ) multiple small , furrowed papule , especially neck axilla , ( 2 ) single multiple filiform smooth growth various location , ( 3 ) solitary bag-like pedunculated growth , see commonly low trunk . Most regard sign cutaneous age . The presence human papillomaviruses ( HPVs ) , especially mucosal type , demonstrate acrochordon . Our previous experience HPV type skin tag also confirm find . Though HPV ubiquitous virus , presence mucosal type HPV non-mucosal site exceptional . This investigation try correlate clinicopathological HPV molecular type acrochordons . A good understanding acrochordon relation HPV infection may improve ability prevent treat .</detailed_description>
