	<brief_summary>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) disease fatty build-up , `` plaque , '' accumulate peripheral artery . People PAD often experience leg pain walking due reduce blood flow leg . This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) technique examine specific feature plaque build-up leg artery affect walk ability , leg strength , balance people PAD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Plaque build-up cause atherosclerosis increase risk blood clot , heart attack , stroke . Blockages plaque occur different area body . PAD , circulatory disorder blockage occur peripheral artery , one manifestation atherosclerosis . Individuals PAD experience reduce blood flow leg , may cause leg pain walking . This study use MRI technique examine characteristic plaque build-up leg artery change time change affect function , walk ability , leg strength , balance people PAD . Results study may use shape future research study attempt identify effective treatment people PAD . This study enroll people PAD , well small control group people PAD . At initial study visit , study researcher interview participant collect information medical history , daily activity level , walk ability , mental functioning . Blood collection leg MRI occur . Also , blood flow leg measure compare blood pressure measurement arm leg . Leg function measure series time walk , leg strength exercise , muscle power exercise . Questionnaires assess participant ' medical history complete participant 's primary care doctor , study researcher review participant ' medical record . Participants knee pain knee x-ray , participant may wear small device call accelerometer 1 week monitor physical activity level . During second third study visit , occur one two year follow-up , blood flow , leg function , leg strength measure . If participant attend either study visit , researcher may visit participant home conduct interview phone . Study researcher may contact participant phone twice year follow-up .</detailed_description>
