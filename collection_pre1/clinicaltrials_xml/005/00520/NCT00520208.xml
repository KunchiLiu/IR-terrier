	<criteria>Patients must meet follow criterion admission study : 1 . Have diagnosis either relapse and/or refractory APL : Refractory disease define confirmed diagnosis APL myeloblast plus promyelocyte count &gt; 10 % bone marrow patient fail respond induction therapy first second line set . Induction therapy must include ATRA ATObased therapy give either sequentially combination . Relapsed disease define confirmed diagnosis APL myeloblast plus promyelocyte count &gt; 10 % bone marrow follow document complete remission positive RTPCR assay PML/RARα two consecutive test separate least one month , treatment ATRA ATObased therapy give either sequentially combination . 2 . Confirmation diagnosis relapsed/refractory APL must obtain blood bone marrow mononuclear cell least one follow method : Conventional cytogenetics show translocation ( 15:17 ) , Positive RTPCR assay PML/RARα , Fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) analysis show evidence PML/RARα translocation . 3 . Patients must receive failed therapy ATRA ATO either within separate induction/consolidation schedule ( ) . Treatment must administer minimum 28 day agent . Treatment may administer either combination therapy sequentially single agent . Patients fail complete course induction/consolidation therapy , specify , due drug intolerance eligible study . 4 . Patients ATO contraindicate ( example due congenital long QT syndrome ) eligible inclusion study receive failed ATRA therapy define ( 3 ) . 5 . Be able provide write informed consent prior enrollment study . 6 . Be ≥ 18 year old . 7 . Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status ≤ 2 . 8 . Have estimate life expectancy ≥ 12 week . 9 . Be male nonpregnant , nonlactating female . Fertile patient must agree use effective barrier method contraception ( e.g. , latex condom , diaphragm , cervical cap ) avoid pregnancy therapy 90 day follow discontinuation study drug . [ In country double barrier contraception require Regulatory Authorities , patient fertile must agree use 2 form barrier method contraception ( e.g. , latex condom AND diaphragm cervical cap ) therapy 90 day follow discontinuation study drug . ] A nonfertile female define : Postmenopausal ( amenorrheic ≥ 12 month ) Undergone complete oophorectomy hysterectomy . 10 . Have negative serum urine pregnancy test within 10 day prior first dose study drug ( patient female childbearing potential ) . 11 . Have adequate organ function . Patients meet follow criterion exclude study admission : 1 . Extramedullary leukemia . 2 . Patients vitamin A preparation patient hypervitaminosis A . 3 . Have receive cytotoxic therapy ≤ 2 week start therapy . If patient need agent due urgent medical care within 2 week prior start tamibarotene , waiver may grant INNOVIVE Medical Monitor . 4 . Have history myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . 5 . Have impair cardiac function clinically significant heart disease include : Myocardial infarction within 3 month , unstable angina pectoris , congenital long QT syndrome clinically significant rest bradycardia ( &lt; 50 beat per minute ) , uncontrolled congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , history labile hypertension , history poor compliance antihypertensive medication . 6 . Have active , uncontrolled systemic infection consider opportunistic , lifethreatening , clinically significant time treatment . 7 . Have clinically significant acute chronic liver renal disease consider unrelated leukemia . 8 . Have uncontrolled hyperlipidemia . 9 . Have uncontrolled poorly control diabetes mellitus . 10 . Have impair gastrointestinal function may significantly alter drug absorption ( e.g. , uncontrolled vomiting , ulcerative colitis , malabsorption , small bowel resection ) . 11 . Are pregnant lactating . 12 . Have psychiatric disorder ( ) would interfere consent , study participation , followup . 13 . Have recover acute toxicity previous therapy prior enrollment . 14 . Have severe concurrent disease and/or uncontrolled medical condition , , judgment investigator , could predispose patient unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol . 15 . Have history another primary malignancy actively treat last 24 month . 16 . Are unwilling unable comply protocol .</criteria>
