	<brief_summary>Background : Major problem stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) cancer treatment lack suitable donor patient without HLA tissue-matched sibling graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , serious side effect immune-suppressing chemotherapy give bring cancer control SCT . In GVHD , patient immune system attack transplant donor cell . This study try improve result SCT unrelated HLA-matched donor use target immune-depleting chemotherapy bring cancer control transplantation low chance graft rejection , follow reduced-intensity transplant chemotherapy make procedure less toxic . Objectives : To evaluate safety effectiveness target immune-depleting chemotherapy follow reduced-intensity transplant chemotherapy patient advance cancer blood immune system . To evaluate safety effectiveness two different drug combination prevent GVHD . Both regimen successful prevent GVHD , work different mechanism affect rebuild immune system transplant . Eligibility : People 18 74 year age advance high-risk cancer blood immune system suitable HLA-matched sibling . Design : All patient receive chemotherapy transplant treat cancer suppress immune function . All patient receive condition regimen cyclophosphamide 4 day fludarabine 4 day SCT prepare transplant . Patients randomly assign one two combination drug treatment prevent GHVD follow : - Group 1 : Tacrolimus start 3 day SCT continue 6 month , plus methotrexate day 1 , 3 , 6 , 11 post-SCT , plus sirolimus start 3 day SCT continue day 14 follow SCT . - Group 2 : Alemtuzumab 4 day start 8 day SCT , plus cyclosporine start 1 day SCT continue 6 month . Patients receive donor stem cell immune cell 2 day condition regimen . Patients follow clinic regularly first 6 month SCT , less often least 5 year . Some visit may include bone marrow aspirate biopsy , blood draw , test monitor disease status . A skin biopsy , oral mucosa biopsy , saliva collection do study chronic GVHD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - The major limitation broader applicability allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) treatment malignancy lack suitable donor therapy-related toxicity include delayed incomplete immune reconstitution graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . Based theory rapid establishment donor chimerism essential optimal graft-versus-tumor effect , employ strategy target immunedepleting chemotherapy prior reduced-intensity allogeneic HSCT . It intent investigate approach set HLA-matched unrelated donor pilot manner . - A clearly superior GVHD prophylaxis regimen establish unrelated donor transplant setting . The best result report combination alemtuzumab plus cyclosporine [ AC ] combination tacrolimus , methotrexate , sirolimus [ TMS ] . These two regimen work mechanisms biologically distinct potentially markedly different effect upon immune reconstitution well study . In addition neither regimen assessed affect chronic GVHD use NIH Consensus Conference Criteria . It intent study effect two regimen immune reconstitution chronic GVHD set sequential target immune-depleting chemotherapy reduced-intensity allogeneic HSCT HLA-matched unrelated donor . Objectives : - Primary objective : 1. assess effect two biologically distinct GVHD prophylaxis regimen , TMS AC , immune reconstitution patient receive targeted-immune depletion reduced-intensity allogeneic HSCT HLA-matched unrelated donor . As part comprehensive assessment immune reconstitution , primary immunologic endpoint determination CD4+ T cell receptor V BETA repertoire CDR3 spectratyping 3 month post-transplant . 2. assess overall safety two regimen set , determined engraftment , acute GVHD , early late treatment-related mortality , overall survival . 3. determine monitor incidence , organ severity overall severity chronic GVHD prospectively use newly develop NIH Consensus Conference diagnosis stag criterion preliminarily validate tool use clinical practice trial ( Pavletic , Imanguli , Cowen ) . - Secondary objective include assessment immune reconstitution , study engraftment kinetics , assessment patient receive high dos anthracyclines long short term toxicity Eligibility : - Adults ( 18 74 year ) advance high risk hematologic malignancy include AML , ALL , MDS , CLL , NHL , HL , CML , multiple myeloma , MPD lack suitable HLA match sibling . - An unrelated donor match minimum 7 8 allele ( HLA-A , -B , -C , DRB1 ) high resolution typing , identify National Marrow Donor Program . - Life expectancy least 3 month , ECOG le equal 2 relatively normal major organ function . Design : - Patients receive disease-specific induction chemotherapy ( EPOCH-F/R FLAG ) prior transplant disease control immune depletion . If disease control ( great PR ) immune depletion objective meet , patient may forgo induction chemotherapy move forward transplant condition regimen . - All patient receive identical conditioning regimen consist cyclophosphamide 1200 mg/m ( 2 ) /day IV 4 day fludarabine 30 mg/m ( 2 ) /day 4 day . - Patients stratify accord degree HLA-match randomize time enrollment one two GHVD prophylaxis regimen : - Arm A ( TMS ) : Tacrolimus , start day -3 transplant , give initially 0.02 mg/kg/day CIV equivalent oral dose six month , methotrexate 5 mg/m ( 2 ) IV day +1 , +3 , +6 , +11 post-transplant , sirolimus give initial load dose 12 mg p.o . day -3 pre-transplant subsequently 4 mg daily day +63 post transplant . - Arm B ( AC ) : Alemtuzumab 20 mg/day IV 8 h day -8 -4 pre-transplant cyclosporine , start day -1 transplant , give initially 2mg/kg IV every 12 hour equivalent oral dose six month . - A maximum 105 patient enrol randomly assign two arm order yield 44 patient per arm ( 88 total patient ) able evaluate development severe chronic GVHD . This represent increase 20 patient number permit prior amendment : 25 patient ( 50 total ) randomly assign arm within 8/8 match group 13/arm ( 26 total ) within 7/8 match group ( maximum study enrollment = 76 transplanted patient among 85 patient register ) .</detailed_description>
