	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Celecoxib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving chemotherapy radiation therapy together celecoxib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give irinotecan cisplatin together radiation therapy without celecoxib work treat patient stage II , stage III , stage IV esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To measure rate cellular apoptosis proliferation baseline chemoradiotherapy without celecoxib use biopsy sample patient stage II , III , IV esophageal cancer . - To determine acceptable rate pathologic complete remission achieve subset patient potentially resectable esophageal cancer . Secondary - To assess safety addition daily celecoxib chemoradiotherapy . - To estimate median overall survival subset patient resectable disease . - To quantitate expression cyclooxygenase ( COX ) -2 formation prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) patient esophageal cancer . - To assess ability celecoxib decrease formation PGE2 tumor tissue measure pre- post-treatment tumor concentration PGE2 . - To quantitate downstream effect inhibition COX-2 function set treatment chemotherapy . - To measure radiographic response rate patient unresectable esophageal cancer . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients sequentially enrol 1 2 treatment group . - Group 1 : Patients receive cisplatin IV 1 hour irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute day 1 , 8 , 22 , 29 , 43 , 50 , 64 , 71 . Patients also undergo radiotherapy daily 5 day week 5 week begin day 43 . - Group 2 : Patients receive chemoradiotherapy group 1 . Patients also receive oral celecoxib twice daily begin 3 day initiation chemotherapy continue completion chemoradiotherapy . In group , patient potentially resectable disease undergo surgery 12 week completion chemoradiotherapy . Endoscopic tumor biopsy specimen collect baseline day 3 radiotherapy . Samples analyze cyclooxygenase ( COX ) -2 gene protein expression ; PGE2 secretion ; apoptotic activity ; caspase-3 activation ; cytochrome c translocation ; VEGF mRNA quantitation ; cellular proliferation . Laboratory technique use include RT-PCR , IHC , enzyme immunoassay , TUNEL assay , colorimetric assay , northern blotting . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 34 patient ( 8-10 group 1 24 group 2 ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
