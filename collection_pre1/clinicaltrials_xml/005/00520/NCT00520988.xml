HYPOTHESES : 1 . A sizable population patient high risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality , base uncontrolled hypertension . 2 .

	<detailed_description>Hypertension , high blood pressure ( BP ) , affect 65 million people almost 1 every 4 adult U.S . Individuals normal BP 55 year age 90 % lifetime risk develop hypertension . The level BP elevation directly relate person 's subsequent risk heart attack , heart failure , stroke , kidney failure . In 2002 , hypertension primary contributing cause death 11 % US deaths cost hypertension estimate $ 59.7 billion . The prevalence sequela uncontrolled hypertension increase population age unless develop good program control high BP . Hypertension treatable . If reduce person 's elevated BP , reduce risk stroke 30 % , heart attack others form coronary heart disease 20 % , congestive heart failure 50 % , premature death 10 % .3 Despite evidence support hypertension treatment , half patient hypertension inadequate BP control . We improve hypertension control Colorado implement population-based intervention use interactive voice response ( IVR ) technology deliver patient three healthcare system across Colorado ( Denver Health Hospitals [ DH ] , VA Colorado Healthcare System [ VA ] , Kaiser Permanente Colorado [ KPCO ] ) . Together , organization serve 1 million Coloradans . The IVR-based hypertension program : 1 ) reach patient use few resource traditional patient visit approach , 2 ) implement evidence base guideline therapy , 3 ) facilitate patient ' acquisition medication allow order receive medication home , 4 ) enhance medication adherence use tailor educational motivational message . This program duplicate supplant funding exist program , complement exist program base traditional provider-patient encounter . IVR computer-based telephone system initiate outbound call , receive inbound call , provide information collect data patient office visit . An IVR system three component : 1 ) standard microcomputer , 2 ) hardware interfaces telephone system place call , 3 ) software control call operation . Patients require telephone participate IVR program . Over 95 % Coloradans telephone . People familiar IVR application system use airline provide flight information healthcare organization arrange clinic appointment refill prescription . *Detailed description study procedure ( duration , description intervention , study measure , endpoint , specific aim , etc ) : Study Visits ( study arm ) : At baseline visit study arm , baseline BP record patient provide educational material . In addition , baseline questionnaire complete include survey medication adherence . Participants assign arm return clinic 6 month visit . Prior 6 month study visit , enrol patient receive reminder letter inform pending study appointment . During 6 month visit , project staff review follow survey , obtain 6 month blood pressure measurement , assess current medication , administer satisfaction survey . Usual Care plus IVR arm : For patient randomize usual care plus IVR arm , clinically validate electronic BP cuff provide cost one . For patient cuff , ask bring cuff baseline visit evaluate study staff determine accurate enough use . Patients taught proper technique use BP cuff orient IVR technology function . Participants assign usual care plus IVR arm also meet clinical pharmacist review adjust necessary current medication plan , establish rapport program . All usual care plus IVR patient ask return 1 month post-baseline visit , blood pressure check , receive first blood pressure report person , review IVR system study staff necessary . If medication change make baseline , patient may also need meet briefly clinical pharmacist one month visit . If additional clinical pharmacist visit require beyond one month visit laboratory test monitor drug change , provide per current KPCO usual care . During 6 month follow-up , patient usual care plus IVR arm ask call IVR system weekly enter BP measurement past week use touch tone pad phone . Through IVR system , patient encourage report symptom experience ask question raise concern . They also listen brief module diet , exercise , smoke cessation . The duration call depend number blood pressure measurement enter patient 's response question . Per JNC VII guideline , patient encourage enter minimum 4 measurement per week . From previous focus group test , call expect take 5-10 minute . To maximize safety , patient instruct seek immediate medical attention acute problem , i.e. , chest pain and/or enter BP measurement exceed threshold ( e.g . SBP &gt; 200 mm Hg DBP &gt; 100 mm Hg ) . An IVR report summarize information gather call produce review clinical pharmacist . The clinical pharmacist contact patient problem identify patient ' request . Based BP data provide patient , clinical pharmacist , physician oversight , adjust antihypertensive medication suggest additional medication use national JNC VII hypertension guideline . This recommendation copy patient 's primary care provider ( PCP ) , along IVR BP data . Currently , system multidisciplinary management chronic illness place three institution accept clinician . Therefore , management BP clinical pharmacist physician supervision IVR intervention consistent usual care three site . Patients usual care plus IVR arm instruct call weekly IVR system 6 month . During time , participant also receive monthly feedback report form cover letter graph weekly average blood pressure baseline visit current month . At end 6 month study period , patient 's BP stabilize normal level accord establish guideline , `` graduate '' study . Based prior experience , expect patient attain controlled blood pressure 2-3 month average , recognize patient quickly others slowly . Therefore , end 6 month study wave , patient graduate study . After graduate study , patient may continue enter blood pressure measurement IVR system , frequency call monitor enforce . After graduate , patient still able report concern ask question clinical pharmacist . For patient reach control end 6 month visit , refer back PCP BP management PCP notify continue uncontrolled reading .</detailed_description>
