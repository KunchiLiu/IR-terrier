	<brief_summary>The eradication HIV antiretroviral therapy thus far elusive . It consistently demonstrate pool latently infect , rest CD4+ T cell persist majority HIV-infected individual receive antiretroviral therapy plasma viremia successfully suppress prolonged period time ; pool emerge major obstacle achieve eradication HIV . We believe MK-0518 decay suppression HIV-1 patient virologically suppress prolonged period time effective cART ( â‰¥ 4 year ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integrase Inhibitor ( MK-0518 ) Viral Decay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial prospective , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study two phase : phase I 48 week phase II 96 week primary analysis 48 week . HIV-infected individual take first standard cART regimen least four year complete viral suppression . Upon enrollment , he/she randomize one two arm : MK-0518 arm control arm . As participant reach week 48 , he/she unblinded MK-0518 arm continue take MK-0518 . Based result interim analysis , control arm roll receive MK-0518 48 week . After screen , baseline visit week 4 safety visit , follow-up visit occur every 8 week arm .</detailed_description>
