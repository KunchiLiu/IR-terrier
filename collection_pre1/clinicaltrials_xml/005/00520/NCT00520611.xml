	<brief_summary>Obesity major cause premature age second lead cause preventable mortality United States , account approximately 110,000 death per year . Financial incentive effective modify number health behavior rarely apply weight loss , best knowledge never weight loss low-SES obese veteran . We propose test two different approach use financial incentive encourage weight loss . In first , build previous work show effectiveness 'deposit contract ' , subject give opportunity put money risk lose weight . In incentive condition , subject receive direct payment conditional daily weight loss , optional additional payment base contribution deposit contract . We match contribution 1:1 make option deposit money attractive predominantly low SES population . In second approach build prior work use lottery promote drug adherence . In incentive condition , participant enter daily lottery , receive payoff earn lottery stay track weight-loss goal . Given popularity general population , lottery hold promise provide cost-effective mean motivate weight loss making effort lose weight salient obese patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Effectiveness Financial Incentives Promoting Weight Loss Among Obese Individuals .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifty-seven obese patient Philadelphia VAMC ( BMI 30-40 ) randomly assign one three condition : weight monitoring ( WM ) , deposit contract incentive ( DC $ +WM ) , lottery-based incentive ( L $ +WM ) . Exclusion criterion study minimal maximize generalizability , focus exclusion may make participation unfeasible unsafe ( myocardial infarction within 6 month ; uncontrolled hypertension , define BP &gt; 170 mm Hg systolic BP &gt; 110 mm Hg diastolic ; metastatic cancer , self-report 6 alcoholic beverage per day ; schizophrenia ; severe depression ; active substance abuse ; inability read severe cognitive deficit would preclude ability read consent form fill survey ) . Patients severe depression refer treatment consider ineligible effectively treat . This exclusion appropriate severely depressed ill undertake weight reduction weight loss often symptom severe depression . Subjects also ask interested losing weight ( 5 point scale , range extremely uninterested extremely interested , minimum score 3 inclusion ) . Subjects require age 30-70 , weight loss may difficult less beneficial elderly . No exclusion apply , aim make study generalizable possible . Initial screen BMI 's comorbidities do use VALOR data system CHERP . Subjects paper meet criterion send letter ask call u interested . The remain eligibility criterion assess phone , subject meet criterion invite in-person intake visit . At initial intake visit , study procedure explain , staff create linear graph depict course weight loss require lose 16 pound course 16 week ( see figure ) . Subjects provide write consent participate randomize one 3 arm visit . Participants randomize one two incentive arm inform incentive plan ( described detail ) . Physiologic measurement limit weight height measure staff . To minimize fluctuation weight due diurnal variation , subject ask commit morning appointment ( e.g . 8 1 pm ) intake f/u visit possible . For come morning , ask commit come approximately time afternoon intake f/u visit ( e.g . 2 4 pm ) . As soon possible , follow intake visit , participant one-on-one consultation dietician ( Kelly McBride ) diet exercise discuss . During session , participant receive guidance strategy weight loss . Following consultation , participant ask return PVAMC see coordinator CHERP month four consecutive month : weigh ( participant ) , receive payment earn ( DC $ +WM ) ( L $ +WM ) , complete follow-up questionnaire . Subjects instruct drink one 8 ounce glass liquid small breakfast and/or lunch ( Examples small breakfast would 2 slice whole grain toast jelly one serve whole grain cereal skim milk piece fruit glass skim milk . Light lunch could include one list , broth base soup half turkey sandwich half peanut butter ) prior come follow-up visit . To compensate subject time trouble , participant receive financial incentive time attend monthly weigh-in , regardless whether attain monthly weight loss goal . Subjects also receive financial incentive attend initial intake visit financial incentive attend appointment dietician ( Kelly McBride ) come f/u weigh 3 month incentive weight loss cease . Those two incentive condition provide daily feedback , describe . All message transmit text -enabled pager provide duration study purpose . Subjects ask measure weight morning upon awaken , urinate , eat drink transmit study administrator telephone ( leave message ) . We provide scale accurate 0.1 pound subject use duration study . We tell participant entry study scale keep remain enrol study duration ask return drop study . These scale calibrate initially match weight record scale use CHERP . As mention , two different financial incentive condition test , strong conceptual basis suggestive evidence literature could effective approach help obese patient lose weight . Patients randomized lottery financial incentive arm eligible daily lottery prize expect value $ 3/day ( rough estimate saving per day health plan reduce incidence type 2 diabetes consequence obesity achieve weight loss 10-20 lb ) , prior lottery resolve , report weight desire weight loss trajectory ( see figure ) . The lottery tailor provide infrequent large payoff ( 1 100 chance $ 100 reward ) frequent small payoff ( 1 5 chance $ 10 reward ) . This lottery player motivate forward look element ( fixation large $ amount ) backward look element - often I win . The lottery design , day , subject send early morning weight receive rapid feedback whether , non-adherent subject receive feedback whether would adherent . Subjects ask choose 2-digit number upon entry study , e.g . `` 27 '' . Each morning subject ask call report weight morning . A two digit random number generate day . If last digit include either `` 2 '' `` 7 '' ( approximately 1 5 chance ) , subject report weight target weight day , would eligible win $ 10 . If number `` 27 '' ( 1 100 chance ) would win $ 100 . Information whether would transmit day , via text message , receive feedback immediately . If subject report weight morning ( 12pm ) report weight target weight ( allowance inaccuracy scale ) , inform would lottery day target . We believe desire avoid regret associate winning , learn one would one adherent , powerfully motivate subject adhere - beyond one might anticipate base expect value reward . Moreover , effect probably strengthen experience - i.e. , give subject experience remorse fail obtain reward would receive adherent . Subjects achieve 20 pound weight loss 16 week eligible one-time bonus least $ 50 . Because daily weight self-reported , inform patient receive calculated amount due weight monthly weigh-in target weight ( typically 4 pound weight loss 1 month ) . A 0.2 pound differential allow office scale read participant 's report weight time monthly visit account 0.1 pound scale variance either office take home scale ( e.g . subject lose 3.8 instead 4.0 pound per office scale , receive full incentive ) . These payment would provide use `` Authorization Invoice Medical Hospital Services Form '' allow participant pay directly VA Agent Cashier . Deposit contract financial incentive ( $ +WM ) participant pay base amount correspond $ 3 day track toward lose 16 pound weight end 16-week study . Specifically , receive payment every day weight ideal threshold line ( see figure ) . In addition , participant give opportunity contribute $ 0- $ 3 per day fund , refundable end month meet exceed monthly weight loss goal . As incentive participant contribute deposit contract , match money 1:1 . Thus , participant condition opportunity earn much $ 9 per day ( $ 3 base payment plus $ 3 plus $ 3 match ) . Participants decide begin month much , , wish deposit upcoming month . They therefore change amount deposit contract month month . Any deposit contract money forfeit participant lose sufficient amount weight contribute pool money divide equally among subject lose 20 pound 16 week . The size bonus less $ 50 , shortfall make study fund . Because subject complete study time give subject eligible bonus $ 50 final follow-up visit . If eventual amount end , mail money order `` Authorization Invoice Medical Hospital Services Form '' make difference . Participants ask self-monitor weight daily basis transmit central office phone . Each morning eat drinking urinating , participant ask ) weigh pajama , b ) record weight , c ) transmit weight central office 12 noon . To maintain comparability lottery deposit contract group , every afternoon , participant receive text message tell whether threshold weight payment , , much receive ; threshold weight , much would receive . At monthly weigh-in , participant give report capture report weight compare ideal weight loss trajectory sketch initial consultation session give information much pay weight accurate , well much would receive stayed target . The daily monitoring provide participant constant reminder weight loss goal . This frequency chosen base finding people tend adopt narrow ( daily ) frame reference diet , `` rededicate '' start day . The daily weigh-ins design reduce binge eat make participant constantly `` accountable '' weight . The monthly feedback provide encouragement symbolic reward slow steady weight loss . Falsification weight minimize patient get pay amount identified weekly report degree weight loss record monthly weigh-ins do coordinator consistent self report . A key aspect weight loss trajectory reset monthly interval . This feature critical likely event person fall short attain monthly weight loss goal . Disheartened prospect lose double weight order get `` back track '' end next month , person might drop study . To avoid problem , person reach weight loss previous month give opportunity `` fresh start . '' The overall weight loss goal stay , however , slope trajectory adjust ( i.e . steepen ) participant need `` binge diet '' follow month poor weight loss performance ( see `` Fresh start trajectory '' figure , assume subject lose 2 lb . instead 4 lb . first month ) . Keeping overall weight loss goal constant make procedure fair participant maintain ideal trajectory , adjust slope weight loss line allow subject occasional slip-ups stay engage get back track . Our standard approach receive information subject involve subject call u telephone . We require subject access home computer electronic mail . Weight Monitoring participant ( control group ) give goal lose 16 pound 16 week receive usual care , e.g . care provide regular clinical provider . They give financial incentive lose weight . They ask come monthly f/u visit weigh , receive communication visit study coordinator .</detailed_description>
