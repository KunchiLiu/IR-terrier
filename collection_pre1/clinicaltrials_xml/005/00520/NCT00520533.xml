	<brief_title>Study Safety Effects cG250 Sunitinib Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study explore safety , efficacy effect functional image combination cG250 sunitinib patient advance renal cell carcinoma ( kidney cancer ) . When kidney cancer spread beyond kidney usually possible cure surgery . Other treatment radiotherapy chemotherapy also limit value . Kidney cancer often rely certain protein growth , particularly protein affect way blood vessel grow cancer . Ingrowth blood vessel supply cancer cell oxygen nutrition ; without blood vessel , cancer deposit grow size . When growth blood vessel block , establish cancer may stop grow may shrink . This show work drug target process kidney cancer . One drug call sunitinib . A protein , call G250 , also think important help kidney cancer grow . G250 find cell surface many kidney cancer . One possible method interfere function G250 target G250 antibody know cG250 . Clinical trial cG250 show safe , home kidney cancer cell , persist blood cancer tissue long period time . The main purpose study explore whether combination sunitinib cG250 safe patient advance kidney cancer . The study also assess whether combination able cause kidney cancer shrink ; determine cG250 travel within body , whether immune system react cG250 whether sunitinib affect ; whether combination affect kidney cancer grow blood flow within tumour . Patients advance kidney cancer never previously receive cG250 , sunitinib ( similar drug ) may eligible participate study . A total 14 patient expect recruited . Eligible patient receive cG250 10 mg/m² weekly intravenous infusion five week , follow two-week break ( one cycle ) . The first fifth dose trace-labeled radioactive substance ( ¹²⁴I-cG250 ) detectable special scan call Positron Emission Tomography ( PET scan ) allow study distribution cG250 . Sunitinib 50 mg daily oral dose also give 4 week ( commence day 8 first treatment cycle ) , follow two-week break . Up two cycle treatment give . If second cycle give , cG250 give four weekly dos daily sunitinib start day . No ¹²⁴I-cG250 administer first treatment cycle . The extent kidney cancer assess CT scan baseline end treatment cycle . Safety assessment ( physical examination , blood test , gate cardiac blood pool scan , ECG-heart trace ) perform begin treatment cycle , repeat throughout cycle end study . A number blood test PET scan do first cycle show amount ¹²⁴I-cG250 distributes body . Other PET scan ( [ 18 ] F-FDG [ 15 ] O-H₂O ) perform allow assessment tumour growth blood flow . Blood test also show whether immune system recognise infused cG250 make antibody .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Metastatic unresectable Renal Cell Cancer ( clear cell component ) . Measurable disease RECIST CT least one measurable lesion 2 cm great diameter , deem assessable PET imaging . At least 4 week chemotherapy , radiotherapy immunotherapy ( 6 week nitrosourea drug ) . Expected survival least 3 month . Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) 70 % great . Age 18 year old . Vital laboratory parameter within normal , protocol specify range . Left ventricular ejection fraction great 55 % GCBP scan . Systolic blood pressure ≤150mmHg diastolic blood pressure ≤90mmHg Able give write informed consent . Prior exposure cG250 monoclonal antibody ( exception : circulating human antichimeric antibody cG250 ) . Prior treatment VEGFtargeting agent ( e.g . bevacizumab ) multikinase inhibitor ( e.g . sorafenib ) include sunitinib . ( Patients currently receive sunitinib may eligible tolerate stable dose sunitinib four week / two week regimen , toxicity due sunitinib ≤ CTCAE grade 2 ; investigator deem clinically reasonable withhold sunitinib least four week prior commencement study treatment . ) Active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases ( exception : CNS metastases adequately treat ( surgery radiotherapy ) progression least three month ) . Known HIV positivity . Clinically significant heart disease . History hypertension require hospitalisation . Other serious illness , eg , serious infection require antibiotic , bleed disorder . Major surgery radiation therapy within 4 week prior , plan within 6 week start study treatment . ( Prior palliative radiotherapy metastatic lesion ( ) permit , provide least one measurable lesion irradiate progress follow radiotherapy ) Severe haemorrhage within 4 week prior start study treatment . Any follow within 12 month prior study drug administration : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack , pulmonary embolism . Preexisting thyroid abnormality unstable thyroid function despite medication . Ongoing moderate severe cardiac dysrhythmias , severity atrial fibrillation , prolongation QTc interval great 450 msec male 470 msec female . Participation clinical trial involve another investigational agent within 4 week . Pregnancy breastfeed . Women childbearing potential use medically acceptable mean contraception . Psychiatric addictive disorder may compromise ability give informed consent . Not available followup assessment .</criteria>
