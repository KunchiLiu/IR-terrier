	<brief_title>Intrapleural Minocycline Following Simple Aspiration Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary spontaneous pneumothorax ( PSP ) commonly occur young , tall , lean male . The estimated recurrence rate 23-50 % first episode . The high recurrence rate stimulate development many different therapeutic approach , range conservative treatment observation invasive therapy surgery , optimal treatment patient present first episode PSP remain controversial . In recently publish British Thoracic Society ( BTS ) guideline , simple aspiration recommend first line treatment PSP require intervention treatment provide advantage reduce hospital admission rate reduce length hospital stay compare chest tube drainage . However , recurrence rate procedure around 30 % , make inappropriate standard care . Intrapleural instillation chemical irritant ( chemical pleurodesis ) effective way reduce rate recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax surgical non-surgical patient . Previously , chemical pleurodesis usually administrate chest tube thoracoscopy . Administration sclerosing agent intravenous needle catheter pigtail catheter simple aspiration never report safety efficacy remain unknown . Because recurrence rate simple aspiration remain high , begin instill minocycline pleural cavity pigtail intravenous needle catheter since December 2005 determine adjuvant effective reduce rate recurrence . In present study , report experience minocycline pleurodesis treat first episode PSP successful aspiration pneumothorax . The effect adjuvant therapy evaluate compare outcome patient underwent simple aspiration alone underwent additional minocycline pleurodesis .</detailed_description>
