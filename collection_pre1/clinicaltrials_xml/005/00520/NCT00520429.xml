The propose project design pilot test feasibility brief psychosocial intervention among depressed and/or anxious medical patient confirm symptom COPD and/or CHF cause significant impairment ascertain validated survey . We test intervention open-trial format . Therefore , patient meet inclusion criterion describe receive intervention . Group assignment , randomization , use control subject applicable pilot research project . Data collect baseline , post-treatment ( 8 week ) , 3 month follow-up . Trained member study staff conduct assessment , intervention follow-up session follow protocol . A licensed psychologist supervise member study staff . F2 . Procedure Recruitment Procedures : Patients COPD CHF meet criterion clinically significant physical emotional symptom recruit . Recruitment potential participant ( detailed Section J ) occur database extraction ( e.g . ICD-9 code ) , primary care provider referral , specialty care provider referral ( e.g . cardiology pulmonology ) . Patients contact via letter , provide basic information study .

The RA also determine eligibility administer five item PRIME-MD screen anxiety depression . Given high sensitivity detect depression anxiety , use PRIME-MD reduce number patient without symptom depression anxiety unnecessarily attend in-person interview . If patient meet study eligibility , invite attend in-person study interview . In-person Screening : Initial screen eligible patient invite in-person appointment final eligibility determine baseline assessment measure complete . All appointment take place designate research site . Demographic information collect : age , gender , ethnicity , household income , marital status , education , employment status , current/past smoking ( e.g . pack year ) . Medical history information collect : date onset/diagnosis CHF and/or COPD , current medication usage , history significant illness . The MINI psychiatric interview use determine presence DSM-IV Axis I disorder . Symptoms anxiety depression assess use self-report clinician rat instrument determine final eligibility . Other baseline measure include assessment psychiatric diagnosis ( semi-structured clinical interview ) , quality life ( disease specific general ) , health service utilization ( patient self-report ) . All patient meet eligibility requirement describe Section F invite receive intervention . A study clinician initiate contact patient via telephone subsequently set initial treatment session . Intervention : The intervention psychosocial treatment specifically develop address mental health quality life need chronically ill patient . As intervention contain number unique characteristic design good address mental physical health need patient . It skills-based intervention match patient ' express desire improve quality life within focus intervention module base symptom profile preference care .

At conclusion active treatment phase , participant receive three follow-up telephone call week 8 , 10 , 12 ( refer booster telephone call ) review skill , encourage continued practice , facilitate consolidation treatment gain . Assessments : Data collect baseline , post-treatment ( 8 week ) , 3-month follow-up .</detailed_description>
