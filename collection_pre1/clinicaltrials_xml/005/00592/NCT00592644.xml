	<detailed_description>Clinically , small vascular malformation ( SVM ) vocal fold common problem disturb voice . Currently , problem treat endoscopic microsurgery use Carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) laser microsurgery . However , treatment unsatisfactory invasive nature . The pulsed dye laser ( PDL ) successfully use treatment blood vessel abnormality surface tissue , high selectivity destroy target blood vessel spar normal tissue . Even think process use clinically past 5 year , study determine clinical benefit treatment SVMs vocal ford , compare routine surgery . In proposed study , plan make determination , compare voice recovery voice improvement laser routine surgery ( CO2 laser `` cold '' instrument ) . Our specific aim determine whether PDL produce good quicker voice improvement conventional surgery , 20 patient ( 10 case group ) vocal fold SVM . This first study determine clinical benefit microvascular targeting ( MVT ) technique laser treat vocal fold SVMs , comparison voice result two group . We expect less invasive laser treatment provide ideal excellent alternative current surgical approach treatment disease .</detailed_description>
