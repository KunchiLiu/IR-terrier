	<detailed_description>We collect brain tissue specimens blood sample patient Vanderbilt University Medical Center undergo intracranial surgery remove brain tissue , include brain tumor , tissue epilepsy surgery brain tissue remove surgery non-cancerous type brain tissus . These specimen study use novel microscopic laser-directed protein mass spectrometric analysis . Data different brain tissue include tumor different histological sub-types analyze unique protein signature . These protein signature statistically correlate clinical data include time tumor progression response therapy . The goal study determine molecular pattern predictive tumor behavior , thus lead improve understanding basic biology poorly understood cancer . This turn , may lead refined therapy improve outcome .</detailed_description>
