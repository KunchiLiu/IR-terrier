	<brief_summary>Respiratory recurrent papilloma ( RRP ) one common benign tumor . Surgical removal current management RRP , traumatic procedure , often lead permanent voice dysfunction . In study , develop new , combine RRP treatment pulse dye laser ( PDL ) Celebrex . We determine Celebrex , newly develop inhibitor cyclooxygenase ( COX ) -2 , provide long-term inhibitory effect RRP , therefore prevent RRP recur . This combined strategy , successful propose study , provide new ideal `` voice-preserving '' therapy RRP deliver long-term efficacy manage RRP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RRP surgery usually involve vocal cord region larynx , thereby , result poor voice . Our previous study show efficacy safety microvascular targeting technique ( MVT ) RRP treatment use 585 nm PDL . This technique provide less traumatic alternative surgery . However , postoperative recurrence lesion still remain problem microvascular regrowth . This study continuation effort develop new less traumatic treatment RRP . In study , develop new , combine RRP treatment PDL Celebrex . We determine Celebrex , newly develop inhibitor COX-2 , provide long-term inhibitory effect RRP anti-angiogenic activity synergic effect produce laser therapy . The hypothesis postoperative administration Celebrex provide long-term inhibitory effect microvascular regrowth COX-2 enzyme , thereby , prevent RRP recur PDL therapy . Our specific aim study determine synergic effect PDL Celebrex long-term efficacy Celecoxib prevent postoperative RRP recurrence . We compare new combine strategy traditional treatment 30 adult patient . This first time combine new laser MVT technique COX-2 inhibitor microvascular target therapy RRP . This combined strategy , successful propose study , provide new ideal `` voice-preserving '' therapy RRP deliver long-term efficacy manage RRP safe convenient enough use out-patient treatment .</detailed_description>
