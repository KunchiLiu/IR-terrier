	<brief_summary>The primary aim study determine change upper airway anatomy occur lateral neck rotation subsequent administration continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) anesthetize , spontaneously breathe child . The hypothesis study neck rotation decrease overall upper airway volume constriction level larynx , constriction relieve administration CPAP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CPAP Lateral Neck Rotation Anesthetized Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The commonly perform surgical procedure require general anesthesia pediatric population myringotomy placement pressure equalize tube middle ear . It perform otherwise healthy child chronic middle ear fluid collection infection . In case , general anesthesia accomplish inhalation volatile anesthetic gas , induce unconsciousness analgesia approximately 10 minute take perform procedure . A requirement procedure lateral neck rotation anesthesiologist manage airway . This enhance surgical visibility ( Fig 1 ) . However , well-known clinical consequence lateral neck rotation development upper airway obstruction subsequent hypoxemia.1 Anesthesiologists routinely counteract problem placement oral airway device application CPAP , . Nevertheless , intervene hypoxia often necessitate temporary halting procedure resumption neutral neck position hypoxemia abate . This study determine anatomical mechanism upper airway obstruction lateral neck rotation elucidate effect administration CPAP obstruction . This study use MRI imaging technique use recently CHOP Drs . Raanan Arens Soroosh Mahboubi study three-dimensional characteristic upper airway child . This methodology , develop University Pennsylvania CHOP , utilizes fuzzy connectedness-based automatic segmentation allow visualization upper airway correct anatomical orientation relate airflow.2,3 This technology successfully apply anesthetized child without apparent adverse effect ( see IRB # 2003-2-3189 ) . An additional evaluable patient photograph elective bronchoscopy general anesthesia correlate MRI image image visualize clinically .</detailed_description>
