	<detailed_description>Depression likely prevalent disable psychological complication associate spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . The prevalence major depression people SCI 22 % two six time higher general population . Depression link myriad adverse outcome include poor subjective health , poor community integration , high rate medical complication high rate suicide . Surprisingly randomize control trial treat major depressive disorder ( MMD ) people SCI . Despite widespread use antidepressant population , common assumption antidepressant medication effective well-tolerated among people SCI uncertain . Multiple factor severe stress , bereavement loss reward activity may complicate treatment . Treatment trial suggest antidepressant may effective people medical/neurological condition depression develop primary condition . For almost 20 year clinicians scientist call control clinical trial antidepressant among people SCI order establish evidence-based treatment . The propose study multi-site , randomize , double-blind , placebo control trial venlafaxine XR ( Effexor XR ) 133 adult SCI MDD dysthymia least one month post injury . Participants age 18-64 recruited four SCI Model System sit , University Washington , Rehabilitation Institute Chicago , University Michigan , University Alabama , Birmingham Baylor Institute Rehabilitation , Dallas TX . The purpose study examine efficacy tolerability venlafaxine XR treatment MDD . The primary outcome percent responder ( report least 50 % reduction depression severity baseline end treatment ) venlafaxine XR versus placebo control group use intent-to-treat analysis . Secondary outcome include change pain , health relate quality life participation . A successful clinical trial could lead aggressive identification treatment MDD well improve health quality life important population .</detailed_description>
