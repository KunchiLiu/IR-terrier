	<brief_summary>The purpose study take population lung transplant recipients meet UCLA criterion induction chemotherapy thymoglobulin prospectively study weather give first dose intraoperatively versus postoperatively make difference patient lung transplantation . In addition , cohort compare patient qualify thymoglobulin receive either alternative agent agent . The primary endpoint primary graft dysfunction . We also evaluate several early late end point ventilator day , ICU/hospital day , acute/chronic rejection , infection , CT chest abnormality , survival . We also collect donor lung tissue lavage fluid measurement various protein receptor expression two time point : ( 1 ) prior implementation dose induction chemotherapy ( 2 ) transplantation ( follow course induction chemotherapy ) . This allow u possibly make connection profile various protein receptor clinical outcome , depend weather patient receive induction chemotherapy , start intraoperatively postoperatively .</brief_summary>
