	<brief_summary>Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy ( DMD/BMD ) genetic disorder develop boy . It cause mutation gene dystrophin , protein important maintain normal muscle structure function . Loss dystrophin cause muscle fragility lead weakness loss walk ability childhood teenage year . A specific type mutation , call nonsense ( premature stop codon ) mutation cause DMD/BMD approximately 10-15 % boys disease . PTC124 orally deliver , investigational drug potential overcome effect nonsense mutation . This study Phase 2b trial evaluate clinical benefit PTC124 boys DMD/BMD due nonsense mutation . The main goal study understand whether PTC124 improve walking , activity , muscle function , strength whether drug safely give long period time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2b Study PTC124 Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD/BMD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Phase 2b , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , dose-ranging , efficacy safety study , design document clinical benefit PTC124 administer therapy patient DMD/BMD due nonsense mutation ( premature stop codon ) dystrophin gene . It plan ~165 boys least 5 year age walk least 75 meter ( 80 yard ) enrol . Study subject enrol site North America , Europe , Israel , Australia . They randomize 1:1:1 ratio either high dose PTC124 , low dose PTC124 , placebo . Subjects receive study drug 3 time per day ( breakfast , lunch , dinner ) 48 week . Subjects evaluate clinic visit every 6 week . Additional safety laboratory test , may perform investigational site accredit local laboratory clinic , require every 3 week first 24 week study . At completion blind treatment , compliant participant eligible receive open-label PTC124 separate extension study .</detailed_description>

Treatment systemic aminoglycoside antibiotic within 3 month prior start study treatment . Initiation systemic corticosteroid therapy within 6 month prior start study treatment change systemic corticosteroid therapy ( eg , initiation , change type drug , dose modification relate body weight change , schedule modification , interruption , discontinuation , reinitiation ) within 3 month prior start study treatment . Any change ( initiation , change type drug , dose modification , schedule modification , interruption , discontinuation , reinitiation ) prophylaxis/treatment congestive heart failure within 3 month prior start study treatment . Treatment warfarin within 1 month prior start study treatment . Prior therapy PTC124 . Known hypersensitivity ingredient excipients study drug ( Litesse® UltraTM [ refine polydextrose ] , polyethylene glycol 3350 , Lutrol® micro F127 [ poloxamer 407 ] , mannitol 25C , crospovidone XL10 , hydroxyethyl cellulose , vanilla , CabOSil® M5P [ colloidal silica ] , magnesium stearate ) . Exposure another investigational drug within 2 month prior start study treatment . History major surgical procedure within 30 day prior start study treatment . Ongoing immunosuppressive therapy ( corticosteroid ) . Ongoing participation therapeutic clinical trial . Expectation major surgical procedure ( eg , scoliosis surgery ) 12 month treatment period study . Requirement daytime ventilator assistance . Clinical symptom sign congestive heart failure ( American College Cardiology/American Heart Association Stage C Stage D ) evidence echocardiogram clinically significant myopathy Prior ongoing medical condition ( eg , concomitant illness , psychiatric condition , behavioral disorder , alcoholism , drug abuse ) , medical history , physical finding , electrocardiogram finding , laboratory abnormality , investigator 's opinion , could adversely affect safety subject , make unlikely course treatment followup would complete , could impair assessment study result .</criteria>
