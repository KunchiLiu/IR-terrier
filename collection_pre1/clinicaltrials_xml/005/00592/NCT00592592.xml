	<brief_summary>The main purpose study see use proton beam radiation therapy instead photon beam radiation therapy reduce side effect radiation treatment rhabdomyosarcoma . Photon beam radiation standard type radiation treat rhabdomyosarcoma many type cancer . Photon beam radiation enters body pass healthy tissue , encounter tumor , leave body healthy tissue . A beam proton radiation enters body pass healthy tissue , encounter tumor , stop . This mean less healthy tissue affect proton beam radiation photon beam radiation .</brief_summary>
