	<brief_summary>It unclear effect selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) hypoglycemia . Thus , American Hospital Formulary Service recommend careful monitoring blood glucose level patient diabetes initiate discontinue SSRIs ( Katz et al. , 1996 ) . Because increased prevalence depression diabetes , critical discover affect antidepressant therapy may counterregulatory response hypoglycemia . This study hypothesize chronic administration SSRIs may result blunt counterregulatory response hypoglycemia , thereby leave individual susceptible hypoglycemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypoglycemia Associated Autonomic Failure Type 1 DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor commonly prescribe treat depression , vital understand antidepressant affect hypoglycemia- fear complication diabetes . This study 's aim determine whether individual chronically take selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor reduce ability defend hypoglycemia compare individual take medication , thus leave susceptible hypoglycemia . Both healthy volunteer volunteer type 1 diabetes mellitus study . The result could potentially important diabetic patient , demonstrate physician modify therapy take antidepressant order avoid hypoglycemia . The known effect SSRI hypothalamo pituitary axis ( HPA ) may important counterregulation hypoglycemia . Prior research demonstrate healthy volunteer antecedent increase plasma cortisol result significant blunting neuroendocrine autonomic response subsequent hypoglycemia . Thus , activate HPA axis , SSRIs could cause blunt counterregulatory response hypoglycemia .</detailed_description>
