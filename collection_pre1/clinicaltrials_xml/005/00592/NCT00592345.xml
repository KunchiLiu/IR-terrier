	<brief_summary>The purpose study test effectiveness high dose radiation administer proton photon therapy . Radiation effective treatment many type tumor think radiation alone , give much high dos shorter period time , may effective control recurrence sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Proton/Photon RT + Surgery Sarcomas Thoracic , Lumbar Spine/Sacrum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- In study three type radiation use : standard radiation ( call photon ) ; alternative form radiation call proton beam therapy ; localize radiation applicator plaque apply surface dura ( fibrous outer envelope surround spinal cord fluid surround spinal cord ) time surgical removal tumor . - Radiation treatment ( photon proton ) possibly surgical removal portion tumor intraoperative radiation delivery surface dura intraoperative radiation delivery perform period 12 week . As part treatment planning process , participant need two treatment plan CT scan 2-3 treatment planning session . - Participants receive , total , 39-43 photon/proton treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathological diagnosis malignant mesenchymal tumor thoracic/lumbar/spine/sacrum paraspinal soft tissue involve nerve root extend spinal canal . Interosseous bone sarcoma manage wide resectional surgery patient medically operable . Patient tumor status : 1 ) post biopsy post resection gross residual disease 2 ) post grossly complete resection margin positive close tumor spill cut Lesion may primary recurrent prior surgery No clinical , radiographic evidence distant metastasis Fit exposure affect vertebral segment Life expectancy great 36 month KPS equal great 70 18 year age old Declines radical surgery No prior radiation treatment affect spine region Pregnancy Disease/conditions characterize high radiation sensitivity . These include genetic disease , ataxia telangiectasia . Major local condition local tolerance viz. , multiple surgical procedure , serious local injury . No evident cord/cauda malfunction cause effect local tumor growth due metabolic effect tumor</criteria>
