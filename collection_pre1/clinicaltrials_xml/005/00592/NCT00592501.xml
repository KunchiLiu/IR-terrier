	<brief_summary>Photon beam radiation standard type radiation use treat nasopharyngeal carcinoma . Photon beam radiation enters body pass healthy tissue , encounter tumor leave body healthy tissue . Proton beam radiation show effect tumor photon beam radiation enters body , pass healthy tissue , encounter tumor stop . This mean less healthy tissue affect proton beam treatment photon beam treatment . The purpose study determine effectiveness proton beam radiation treat nasopharyngeal cancer reduce acute long-term side effect treatment . This study also test see spar healthy tissue improve quality life</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Before begin study treatment , participant ask fill Quality Life ( QOL ) questionnaires , Speech Assessment , ChemoSensory Questionnaire , Patient Swallowing Diary , A Swallowing Study , Salivary Tests Trismus Assessment . Participants need go Massachusetts Eye Ear Infirmary ( MEEI ) Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) test . - Radiation therapy give day , five day week , seven week . This give outpatient care Northeast Proton Therapy Center ( proton component ) Massachusetts General Hospital ( photon component ) . - During radiation treatment , participant receive cisplatin intravenously every three week . This three-week period call cycle treatment . - After completion radiation , participant receive cisplatin intravenously every 4 week along fluorouracil continuous infusion 4 day start day cisplatin give , three cycle . - Participants physical exam blood work drawn weekly monitor health . - An MR/CT scan head neck do 2 month radiation treatment . - Follow-up visit occur every three month 2 year , every 6 month year 3-5 , annually . During follow-up visit , participant follow test procedure : physical examination ; blood work ; chest CT scan CT/MRI head neck repeat every 6 month first three year ; swallow study ; salivary study ; QOL questionnaires ; speech assessment ; ChemoSensory Questionnaire ; Trismus Assessment .</detailed_description>
