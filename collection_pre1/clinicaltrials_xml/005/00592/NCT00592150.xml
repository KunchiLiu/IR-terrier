	<brief_summary>Hypothesis test : Dopamine D1-like receptor-induced natriuresis impair human G protein-related kinase 4 gene variant . Our research group discover D1 receptor/adenylyl cyclase couple defect renal PTCs subject essential hypertension . We find increase GRK-4 activity renal PTCs human essential hypertension due activate variant GRK-4 , effect reproduce transfected cell model . Preventing translation GRK-4 normalize couple D1 receptor adenylyl cyclase hypertension . Gene variant GRK-4 cause ligand-independent serine-phosphorylation D1 receptor , result uncoupling G-protein/effector complex . The desensitization D1 receptor renal PTC hypothesize cause compromise natriuretic effect DA eventually lead Na+ retention hypertension . The primary objective protocol demonstrate natriuresis engender D1-like receptor activation fenoldopam blunt subject 3 SNPs GRK-4 compare response subject 0-2 SNPs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dopamine ( DA ) endogenous catecholamine , serve biochemical precursor norepinephrine epinephrine . DA well known neurotransmitter central nervous system . During past decade , however , DA characterize important modulator BP , Na+ balance , renal adrenal function independent peripheral dopaminergic system . Evidence indicate DA synthesize locally within kidney act adjacent cell autocrine paracrine fashion control renal Na+ excretion ( 1,2 ) . The renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) coordinate hormonal cascade , principal effector angiotensin II ( ANG II ) . All component RAS present within kidney intrarenal formation ANG II provide major regulation renal hemodynamic tubule function via self-contained intrarenal RAS ( 3,4 ) . We propose study interaction renal dopaminergic renin-angiotensin system regulation Na+ balance Na+ sensitivity blood pressure ( BP ) pathophysiology essential hypertension man . Our group discover D1 receptor/adenylyl cyclase couple defect renal PTCs subject essential hypertension . We find increase GRK activity renal PTCs human essential hypertension due activate variant GRK-4 , effect reproduce transfected cell model . Preventing translation GRK-4 normalize couple D1 receptor adenylyl cyclase hypertension . The variant GRK-4 cause ligand-independent serine-phosphorylation D1 receptor , result uncoupling G-protein/effector complex . The desensitization D1 receptor renal PTC may cause compromised natriuretic effect DA eventually lead Na+ retention hypertension . Therefore , primary objective entire Program Project Grant , protocol one part , identify human salt-sensitive hypertension resistance inhibitory effect D1-like receptor agonist fenoldopam renal proximal Na+ reabsorption determine whether individual activate polymorphisms GRK-4 alone combination polymorphisms gene RAS . Subjects select ( basis GRK-4 genotype ) pool subject already genetically screen IRB-HSR # 11494 . Subjects prepare studied approximate metabolic balance 150 meq Na+/d . After approximate metabolic balance achieve ( estimate 5 day ) , subject receive either fenoldopam infusion vehicle infusion Day 6 opposite agent ( fenoldopam vehicle ) infuse Day 7 . The order infusion randomize study conduct double-blind fashion . Vehicle D5W infuse control period use rate post control period . At 1100 h study Day 6 , i.v . infusion fenoldopam vehicle initiate continue 3h . The fenoldopam infusion rate 0.05 Î¼g/kg/min . This infusion rate fenoldopam result great 2-fold increase UNaV without alteration systemic hemodynamic function normal subject ( 30 ) . Plasma fenoldopam level monitor document delivery agent circulation . BP heart rate measure duplicate every 10 min experimental period ( 1100-1400h ) . The experimental period follow 2-hour post-control period ( 1400h-1600h ) vehicle infuse . Blood urine sample obtain every 30 min analyze Na+ , K+ , lithium creatinine concentration osmolality . In addition , blood sample analyze PRA , cyclic AMP ( blood urine ) , plasma ANG II aldosterone concentration 1045 , 1215 , 1345 1545 h. After completion post-control period 1600h , subject allow bed remain inpatient receive diet previously . No food give 2400h Day 6 . On Day 7 , identical protocol Day 6 repeat except opposite agent ( fenoldopam vehicle ) infuse . The subject discharge GCRC previous diet .</detailed_description>
