	<detailed_description>Phosphoglycerate kinase ( PGK ) deficiency rare x-linked disorder characterize hemolytic anemia , seizure , muscle fatigue , progressive neurological dysfunction . The disease cause deficiency PGK , enzyme require ATP formation glycolytic pathway . PGK enzyme ubiquitous cell human body , red blood cell , muscle , nerve cell severely affect absence PGK due reliance upon glycolytic pathway . Mutations PGK gene highly variable result diverse phenotype , range mild hemolytic anemia only1 severe mental retardation early death childhood.2-5 The severe phenotype show progressive neurologic deterioration infancy adolescence.2,3,5 PGK-Amiens refers particular mutation A T transversion , predict amino acid change aspartate ( Asp : GAT ) valine ( Val : GTT ) 164th position NH2-terminal methionine residue . This D164V mutation identify previously PGK-Amiens PGK-New York French Chinese family respectively.3,6 This particular mutation result severe phenotype . All 6 boy described literature mutation progressive neurologic decline , seizure , episode hemiplegia , aphasia , emotional lability , severe hemolytic crisis . Two boy die childhood , 2 institutionalized ability communicate provide self-care , 2 moderately mentally retarded seizure hemolytic anemia . The two brother care institution Amiens variant PGK deficiency . Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) become feasible 1960s elucidation Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) complex . Since , therapy evolve effective therapy many hematologic disorder ( 7 ) . Otherwise incurable malignancy frequently cure approach , likelihood cure range 10 % 85 % , depend disease disease-status . The treatment strategy incorporate large dos chemotherapy often radiation eliminate malignant cell immunosuppress recipient enough allow engraftment donor cell . Donor cell give rise hematopoiesis within two three week , rescue patient effect high dose therapy . In ideal circumstance , immune recovery recipient-specific tolerance occur follow 6-18 month , patient cure underlying hematologic disorder , immunosuppression , functionally intact donor-derived immune system . However , complication process common include potentially permanent fatal organ damage effect high dose chemotherapy , infection , hemorrhage , , particular , graft-versus-host-disease . A realistic estimate transplant-related mortality , include death due acute chronic graft-versus-host disease , standard HLA-matched sibling set high 25 % . The risk treatment related mortality thus limit success approach even young patient certainly precludes use old patient . Thus , particularly old patient , new strategy transplantation need . Stem cell allogeneic transplant traditionally obtain one three source : bone marrow ( 1 ) , peripheral blood stem cell mobilize provision growth factor GCSF ( 2 ) , umbilical cord blood ( 3 ) . Each source specific advantage disadvantage . The desired source stem cell allogeneic transplant match sibling donor . However , feasible , match unrelated donor seek National Marrow Donor Program ( NMDP ) . The National Marrow Donor Program ( NMDP ) Minneapolis , Minnesota , establish 1986 facilitate search , procurement , HLA-matched marrow volunteer , unrelated marrow donor patient life-threatening disease curable SCT ( 7 ) . The NMDP network consist 99 donor center , 108 collection center , 150 transplant center Coordinating Center Minneapolis . As June 29 , 2003 , NMDP registry 5,032,382 volunteer marrow donor 28,574 cord blood unit store , facilitate 13,213 unrelated marrow transplant ( marrow , PBSC cord blood ) worldwide . Over 600,000 donor NMDP Registry contribute European registry , affiliate NMDP . In addition , approximately 1 million donor available search NMDP International Cooperative Registries Europe , South America , Asia . On average , search patient 75 % chance find match within NMDP , median time search transplant le 6 month . Vanderbilt University Medical Center NMDP approve aphaeresis center , collection center transplant center adhere policy procedure NMDP outline The 18th Edition NMDP Standards ( effective since September 13th , 2002 , implement February 10th , 2003 ) . Stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) perform child various metabolic disease , include mucopolysaccharide disorder ( MPS ) , leukodystrophies , glycoprotein metabolic disorders.8 The prototypical metabolic disorder SCT Hurler syndrome , MPS IH . Hurler syndrome result lack lysosomal enzyme need degrade glycosaminoglycans , build cause progressive intellectual decline , hepatosplenomegaly , cardiac valvular disease , airway abnormality , skeletal abnormality . SCT perform early disease process lead enzyme replacement stop progression disease.9 SCT help MPS disorder include severe Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome Sly syndrome , unfortunately , reason well understood , SCT help several MPS disorder , Hunter , Sanfilippo , Morquio syndromes.8 X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy disease affect boys variable degree severity . When boys show early MRI change undergo SCT , outcome good , preservation neurological neurocognitive function.10,11 Other leukodystrophies respond early SCT include Krabbe disease metachromatic leukodystrophy.8,12 Glycoprotein metabolic disorder exceedingly rare thus limited experience SCT patient disorder . There successful outcome preservation cognitive function Î±-mannosidosis,13 fucosidosis,14 Batten disease,15 Gaucher disease Type I.16 SCT able salvage child Fabry disease , Tay Sachs disease , Pompe disease , Sandhoff disease.8 Again , poorly understood SCT able stop neurologic decline metabolic disorder others . Definitive therapy PGK deficiency necessarily involve production PGK enzyme . The hemolytic anemia part disease could cure allogeneic stem cell transplant , replace hematopoietic system would ensure production enzyme red blood cell . However , neurologic complication disease would require enzyme find way neuron . Because rarity PGK deficiency , yet control study define efficacious approach . In fact , mention therapy literature . There currently enzyme replacement therapy major research effort underway . To knowledge , stem cell transplant disease perform except one 7 month old child PGK-Amiens Australia , currently prepared SCT . The stem cell source determine donor availability . The donor registry allow donor option donate either peripheral blood bone marrow . ( Please note reference number refer Reference list study protocol , page 9 10 . )</detailed_description>
