	<brief_title>Creatine Safety Tolerability Premanifest HD : PRECREST</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extensive evidence exist neurodegeneration begin many year HD diagnose clinically . Therefore , desirable begin neuroprotective therapy premanifest period aim delay onset , well slow functional decline . Cellular energy depletion present early HD ameliorate creatine , help regenerate cellular ATP . Preclinical evidence creatine 's potential neuroprotective effect animal model HD well-documented . Before clinical efficacy creatine test premanifest HD , long-term safety tolerability must assess individual ability favorably modify biomarkers HD also confirm . A two phase protocol propose 60 premanifest at-risk subject randomize double blind placebo control dose titration study bring 30 gram daily high tolerate dose . The placebo-controlled phase permit detection toxicity intolerability due active compound ( creatine ) , enable dose response assessment biomarkers . In second phase , subject enter year long open-label treatment 30 gram daily creatine . This phase maximize subject active compound promote recruitment retention , expand assessment safety data subject , increase power detect measure potential biological marker response active compound . The clinical impact creatine assess use United Huntington 's Disease Rating Scale . Safety tolerability assess analyze clinical laboratory adverse event . Serum level creatine use ass compliance whether relationship bioavailability response . 8OH2'dG related marker assess determine whether creatine treatment chronically suppress marker energy depletion oxidative injury whether suppression correlate slow progression HD . Morphometric MRI use determine whether creatine slow brain atrophy premanifest HD . This study provide pilot data need plan future study determine whether creatine delay onset slow progress HD premanifest individual .</detailed_description>
