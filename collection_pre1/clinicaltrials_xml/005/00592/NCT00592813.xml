	<brief_summary>Background : Many people suffer hip fracture discharge rehabilitation service significant residual functional limitation disability . We believe home-based exercise program incorporate cognitive-behavioral technique increase exercise adherence promote return daily activity could extend benefit formal rehabilitation patient suffer hip fracture . Specific Aims : We conduct 5-year multi-site randomize controlled trial patient suffer recent hip fracture complete rehabilitation service . The specific aim project address whether : Participation Strong Life ( SFL ) program improve function disability outcomes participant 6-months discharged rehabilitation service . This study also investigate follow secondary hypothesis : 1 . Changes function disability 6-month follow-up correlate change three propose intermediary variable : muscle strength , balance , self-efficacy . 2 . The SFL program significantly improve health-related quality life among participant 6-month follow-up . 3 . At 9-month follow-up SFL program continue significant impact participant ' function disability compare control group . Target population : The target population people age 60 year suffer recent traumatic hip fracture , one residual functional limitation complete inpatient , outpatient homecare rehabilitation service . Intervention : We use enhanced version Strong Life program . This home-based exercise program include resistance exercise use Thera-bands show video/DVD weight-bearing exercise progress use step and/or weight vest . A cognitive-behavioral program customize people recover hip fracture develop focus promote exercise adherence , decrease fear fall increase return daily activity patient 's home community . Design : A randomized control clinical trial implement measure efficacy Strong Life program . An attention-control intervention provide participant assign control group . The outcome evaluation point : - T0 : baseline , point discharge formal rehabilitation ; - T2 : 6-month outcome assessment - T3 : 9-month follow-up Outcomes : The primary outcome function measure self-report ( AM PAC ) physical performance measure ( SPPB ) . Secondary outcome include disability , self-efficacy , balance , strength , cognition , reaction time . Adherence exercise program adverse event also monitor .</brief_summary>
