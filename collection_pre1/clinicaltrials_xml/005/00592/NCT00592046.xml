	<brief_summary>This study use new investigational ( yet approve FDA widespread use ) drug call ZIO-101 , organic arsenical . You must diagnose relapsed/refractory leukemia lymphoma ( blood cancer ) try standard therapy . This study design determine whether ZIO-101 may give safely . The study also test whether ZIO-101 help treat blood cancer . We anticipate approximately 22 35 patient take part study . Arsenic use medicinal agent century many different culture . Most recently United States , inorganic arsenic compound approve FDA treatment patient relapse acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . However , use inorganic arsenic limit narrow range activity systemic toxicity , notably cardiac system . ZIO-101 organic arsenic derivative . In vitro test National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) cancer cell panel vivo test leukemia animal model demonstrate substantial activity SGLU hematologic cancer . In vitro test SGLU use NCI human cancer cell panel also detect activity lung , colon brain cancer , melanoma , ovary kidney cancer . Moderate activity see breast prostate cancer cell . Data suggest organic arsenic generates reactive oxygen specie cell induce apoptosis cell cycle arrest .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial ZIO-101 Hematologic Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study find answer follow question : 1 . What large dose ZIO-101 give day 5 day every 4 week ( `` cycle '' ) ? 2 . What side effect ZIO-101 administered way ? 3 . After get drug much ZIO-101 remain blood stream 8 day first injection ? 4 . Is ZIO-101 useful reduce blood cancer ? A series test take throughout study : medical history record , physical exam perform , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) ( measurement heart activity ) , blood test . The amount blood take lab test equal 2 1/2 tablespoon . In addition , urine pregnancy test ( applicable ) , urine sample take test kidney work correctly . To see current condition blood cancer , additional test may need perform already do recently . These test may include : bone marrow biopsy , special test blood , CT scan bone scan . Immediately treat ZIO-101 , another physical examination , also ask medicine take feeling . The blood test may need repeat along EKG urine test . In addition , small blood sample must take immediately injection ZIO-101 . The injection ZIO-101 take approximately one hour . Following first injection , 6 sample blood take 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 12 hour . Additional blood sample take prior dose ZIO-101 . You also repeat EKG within one hour complete injection . This process repeat 5 consecutive day . Your next visit Week 2 onset visit , blood sample take ask feel . At Weeks 3 4 , another blood sample take ask feel . At end Week 4 , new cycle begin . Immediately treat ZIO-101 , physical examination , ask medicine take feeling . The blood test repeat along EKG urine test . In addition , test use measure blood cancer repeat toward end cycle . You may receive six cycle .</detailed_description>
