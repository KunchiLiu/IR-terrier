	<brief_title>Whole Body Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Detection Cancer Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers would like find new whole-body MRI technique able find cancer metastases well whole-body bone scan , current standard care . Screening Tests : Before start treatment study , `` screen question '' help doctor decide eligible take part study . You ask complete questionnaire find reason would able receive MRI scan . The questionnaire cover topic whether pacemaker medication may take . It take 10-15 minute complete questionnaire . You also either bone scan positron emission tomography / compute tomography ( PET/CT ) screen period check disease spread bone . A bone scan picture take , radioactive substance inject bloodstream , allow doctor see abnormal area bone . A PET/CT scan type x-ray scan us inject chemical help doctor `` see '' image clearly . For 6 hour PET/CT scan , must eat drink anything except water . A small tube place arm , receive injection small amount mildly radioactive sugar material bloodstream . The radioactive nature inject material allow scanner `` see '' certain place body . After injection , need rest quietly time scan . The amount rest time may vary , prepared wait 45 90 minute . During scan , lie flat back table . The scan may last 1 hour . Study Procedures : If find eligible agree take part study , scan use whole-body MRI , without `` contrast agent '' ( chemical substance inject blood stream help scanner `` see '' blood vessel well ) . This perform receive bone scan standard care scan . MRI use large magnet instead x-ray take picture inside body . People metal body ( pacemaker , neurostimulators , certain clip , staple earlier surgery ) may receive MRI . The magnetic field use MRI scan may harm people cause problem device pacemaker . During MRI procedure , part body pass long , narrow tube scanner , open end . The scanner intercom , allow speak doctor staff procedure . The machine produce loud knocking noise . This normal . You give earplug protect ear . The MRI also require line insert one vein inject contrast agent . Healthy volunteer participate study contrast agent inject scan . Depending tall , image entire body achieve time scan 5 6 different table position . The table scan move without reposition . All image take within total scan time 1 hour . The MRI finding compare bone scan receive MRI . This comparison help researcher find well MRI able `` see '' cancer metastasis . Study Length : After whole-body MRI , participation study . This investigational study . All MRI scan perform commercially available GE Signa scanner ( GE Healthcare , Milwaukee , WI ) . All image technique use do accord FDA MRI safety guideline . Up 35 patient 5 healthy volunteer take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
