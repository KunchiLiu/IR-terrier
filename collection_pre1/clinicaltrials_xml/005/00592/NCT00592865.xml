	<brief_summary>Study Objective : Brain tumor poorly understood . The purpose research examine whether factor lifestyle play role brain tumor development . The study also investigate contribution inherit susceptibility risk brain cancer . By gain good understanding influence , investigator hope learn prevent brain tumor future generation , develop effective strategy treatment . Study Protocol : This case-control investigation . Persons affect brain tumor compare unaffected person previous medical history , diet factor . Those enrol study participate interview general background , diet , medical history lifestyle , provide sample DNA , clipping toenail , tap water sample home . All procedure perform clinic mail . 'Cases ' : Cases eligible study person recent diagnosis primary brain tumor ( glioma meningioma ) , least 18 year age . 'Controls ' : Controls study non-family member patient , similar age gender . Suitable control include in-laws , friend , neighbor co-worker .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : The primary objective research establish clinic-based case-control study examination potential risk factor primary adult brain tumor . After assemble series 1,500 case 3,000 control , investigator test current hypothesis ge-netic environmental risk factor occurrence tumor . STUDY DESIGN : In case-control study , person recent diagnosis ( within 4 month ) primary brain tumor identify neurology/neurosurgery clinic major treatment referral center Southeast . Non-blood related relative ( eg . in-law ) , friends person recruit control . Names contact information eligible control ascertain patient . A total 1,500 case 3,000 control enrolled course 5-year study . All enrolled subject complete one hour interview lifestyle , environmental exposure , diet , physical activity , tobacco use medical history . They also ask provide DNA sample , water sample toenail sample ( great toe ) . At end data collection , lifestyles genetic attribute compare case control identify difference may relevant causation disease . Because study recruit patient near time disease diagnosis , full enrollment possible . In addition , high re-sponse rate anticipate among control . Thus , large number patient available high anticipate response rate , study offer unique opportunity successfully identify environmental genetic risk factor uncommon form cancer .</detailed_description>
