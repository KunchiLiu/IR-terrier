	<detailed_description>Virtually adult suffer decline cognitive capacity degree . Typically , cognitive decline characterize slow , progressive decline ability ( frequently memory , attention , inhibition speed processing ) relative young adult , commonly call normal aging , age-associated memory impairment , age-consistent memory impairment , benign senescent forgetfulness , late-life forgetfulness , ageing-associated cognitive decline , preferred term , age-related cognitive decline ( ARCD ) As virtually adults experience reduction cognitive ability age , ARCD generally consider normal , inevitable , irreversible part age ; extremely severe form pathological cognitive decline ( e.g. , Alzheimer 's disease , AD ) dominate therapeutic research area . However , ARCD represent important cause quality life decline almost every older adult , impact forgetfulness mental slow increasingly change ability individual successfully manage day-to-day activity . Therapeutic approach target specific problem ARCD normal age ( opposed pathological problem AD ) would unto represent important clinical advance . This trial investigate effect computer-based visual training exercise build principle positive brain plasticity design use healthy mature individual . The program specifically design improve fidelity sensory representation early visual cortex .</detailed_description>
