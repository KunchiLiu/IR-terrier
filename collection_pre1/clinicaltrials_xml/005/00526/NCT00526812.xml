	<brief_title>A Safety Study RTA 744 Patients With Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant glioma , glioblastoma multiforme anaplastic astrocytoma , rapidly grow primary brain tumor associate high degree morbidity mortality . Despite aggressive treatment , median survival rate GBM approximately 12 month , two-year survival rate 8 12 % , median survival patient AA range 2 3 year time first diagnosis . RTA 744 close chemical analogue well characterize anti-cancer agent doxorubicin . Unlike doxorubicin , RTA 744 show ability cross blood brain barrier achieve high concentration CNS tumor tissue animal model . It administer i.v . infusion either daily 3 consecutive day repeat every three week , weekly 4 consecutive week repeat every 5 week . Once maximum tolerate dose determine , new group patient enrol study evaluate tolerability MTD administer expand schedule ( week ) .</detailed_description>
