	<brief_summary>Total hip replacement cost effective procedure enhance life quality group patient . In period 2000-2004 7-8000 procedure preform , 13 % revision ( 1 ) . Historically , many different principle use first resurfacings cement uncemented total hip replacement know today . In 2000 , 28 different femoral stem 26 different acetabular component regular use Norway . There several well-documented cement acetabular component , uncemented cup . On femoral side several well-documented stem cement uncemented . ( 2 ) . From late 1990 ` reverse hybrid ( uncemented stem cement cup ) frequently use . In 2004 total 276 reverse hybrid hip do trend increase . ( 1 ) . This technique solely base experience fact one combine well two principle ( cement uncemented ) . There scientific evidence technique good well cement THR . One potential problem hydroxyapatite coated component suspect may increase wear due particle theory . ( 3,4 ) . There prospective randomise control RSA DXA study conclude matter . This study hypothesis difference wear osteolysis method .</brief_summary>
