	<brief_summary>Participants diagnose suspected doctor focal liver lesion need evaluation order make accurate diagnosis . Participants would need enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan doctor could information number characteristic focal liver lesion . Participants invite take part clinical study . The purpose study evaluate Primovist , liver-specific MRI contrast medium , efficacy lesion detection characterization , tolerability Chinese patient know suspected focal liver lesion . Primovist , investigational drug study , liver-specific MRI contrast medium develop Bayer Schering Pharma AG . Its active substance Gd-EOB-DTPA . Primovist first approve 2004 Sweden follow approval European community , Switzerland Australia year . Procedures : Before entry study entry study physical examination conduct , blood pressure heart rate measure , blood urine sample take . Current medication medical condition ( include suspect pregnancy ) medical surgical history elicit doctor . After entry study , participant schedule MRI examination , last 25-35 minute . During MRI examination , initial MRI scan without contrast acquire follow another MRI series intravenous administration Primovist . The following day participant ask return hospital follow-up safety evaluation . Possible Benefit Participants schedule receive enhance magnetic resonance imaging scan . Clinical study indicate Primovist increase efficacy detection characterization focal liver lesion provide well contrast focal liver lesion surround normal tissue . Primovist show provide additional information regard existence , number characterization ( lesion non-lesion , malignant benign ) abnormality . Based experience patient give Primovist , adverse reaction observe . Most undesirable effect transient mild moderate intensity . The commonly noted adverse event ( AEs ) subject receive Primovist MRI nausea headache incidence 1.1 % . Other AEs occur 0.5 % subject population feeling hot ( 0.8 % ) , back pain ( 0.6 % ) dizziness ( 0.5 % ) . All AEs occur less 0.5 % patient , e.g . anxiety ; cough ; eye disorder ; fever ; flatulence ; generalize spasm ; hypertension ; injection site symptom include edema , inflammation , reaction ; lightheadedness ; parosmia ; postural hypotension ; taste perversion , motoric unrest ; acute respiratory distress ; fatigue ; malaise ; vomit ; palpitation , erythema , chest pain back pain . Coldness , warmth pain injection site , injection site reaction , injection site accumulation fluid rare . In rare case strong allergy-like reaction range shock may occur . Post-marketing tachycardia restlessness report . As case investigational drug , may also unforeseen side effect . Additional information concern Gadolinium- base contrast agent Primovist contains rare earth metal gadolinium active ingredient . There report nephrogenic systemic fibrosis ( NSF ) associate use gadolinium-containing contrast agent ( especially Omniscan ) patient severe renal impairment . NSF systemic disease characterise formation connective tissue skin , becomes thicken hard , sometimes leading contracture joint immobility . The clinical course usually progressive currently treatment available . To date NSF report association Gd-containing contrast agent , role contrast agent overall pathogenesis disease still completely understood . No report patient NSF administration Primovist® know . The risk trigger NSF risk patient severe renal impairment consider low Primovist® due low dose give additional excretion via feces . Furthermore participation patient severe renal impairment exclude study . In case participant suffer renal insufficiency , tell tell doctor prior application contrast agent . In case participant experience new alteration skin follow administration contrast agent , tell contact doctor soon possible recognize symptom .</brief_summary>
