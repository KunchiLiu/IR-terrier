	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : - To establish statistically significant database : With Spectroscopic Oblique-Incidence Reflectometry ( OIR ) experimental system , obtain OIR spatio-spectral image 1,000 human skin non-melanocytic melanocytic lesion , base clinical diagnosis , routinely biopsied submit histopathologic diagnosis adjacent normal skin self-referencing . The experimental database contain demographic information , clinical diagnosis , clinical image , OIR image , histopathologic diagnosis , morphometric data lesion . - To develop validate diagnostic algorithm : 1 . Classification : A subset ( ~50 % ) OIR image collect used complete development state-of-the-art image processing algorithms extract robustly effective diagnostic feature . 2 . Blind Testing Evaluation : The algorithm establish evaluate validated prospective blind-test fashion use complementary subset database involve design classifier . The sensitivity specificity classification system evaluate base receiver-operating-characteristic ( ROC ) curve . - To identify pathophysiologic parameter responsible diagnostic optical feature : The anatomic physiologic source diagnostic optical signature identify comparative analysis use OIR image , microscopic histomorphometric technique theoretical model test follow hypothesis : 1 . The calculated difference hemoglobin oxygen saturation . 2 . Comparisons calculate size distribution skin scatter center histologic morphometric analysis various cellular tissue component skin lesion . 3 . The relative density distribution different anatomic physiologic diagnostic feature within interrogation volume important diagnostic factor OIR .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The OIR imaging probe design reflect light special way order take picture pigment skin . As part standard care , physician check skin lesion may possibly cancerous pre-cancerous . Your physician also check non-cancerous lesion remove cosmetic reason , wart freckle . If agree take part study , study doctor decide lesion biopsied , well lesion eligible image . Pictures lesion ( well healthy tissue nearby ) first take use digital camera . The image probe area skin image clean alcohol . After image probe place lesion , drop baby oil apply skin . The image probe lower contact skin , study staff begin image . Twenty ( 20 ) image 4 different position take per lesion . Care take make sure identify image . For example , study staff avoid take picture face unless lesion . After lesion image , image device take away skin surface clean . The entire imaging procedure , include preparation time , take 5 minute per lesion . Any hair around lesion shave trim , necessary . After image , lesion ( ) biopsied . Your study doctor decide lesion require kind treatment part standard care . Depending study doctor decide , either saucerization biopsies excisional biopsy . A saucerization biopsy remove entire lesion cut `` scoop-like '' manner . An excisional biopsy `` cut away '' entire lesion along part surround skin . A pathologist receive biopsied tissue perform routine test tissue . The test result available study doctor . Depending whether result negative positive , may inform result , biopsies standard care . The image skin use research try make image probe effective . If end participation study early , photographs information remove researcher ' database time . However , record participation remain database . After imaged lesion biopsied , participation study . This investigational study . The OIR imaging probe approve FDA . Up 1,000 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
