	<brief_summary>The purpose research study examine whether Methylphenidate ( MPD ) result improvement gait ( walk ) population Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) patient whose main disability freeze gait . MPD ( RitalinÂ® ) drug excite stimulate certain system body control motor function . This drug FDA approve treatment attention hyperactivity disorder , condition unrelated PD . The researcher hypothesize daily treatment tolerable daily oral dose MPD improve gait velocity , stride length , cadence , decrease freeze gait , 3 month treatment initiation patient moderately advanced PD , whose gait impairment important source disability despite optimized antiparkinsonian treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There total six clinic visit involve study . All study-related assessment take place first practically defined period , , morning least 12 hour last dose antiparkinsonian medication , follow repeat assessment `` '' state clearly identify patient examiner ( approximately 30 60 minute take Parkinson 's medication ) . This `` practically defined period '' state consider desired state report motor change currently available experimental intervention PD . Patients Parkinson 's medication 14 hour assessment . Studying patient off-period widely use manner value new therapy fully measure . During first visit , patient `` randomize '' one study group describe . Neither participant researcher conduct study choose group . Participants receive either placebo dose 1 mg/kg Methylphenidate capsule divide three dos ( 8 , 12 noon , 4 pm ) . An increase medication four week period use target dosage reach , may range 5 8 10-mg capsule per day . A measure balance take patient 's `` '' `` '' motor state study visit . Patients ask stand force plate ( piece equipment measure balance locate floor ) thirty second total four condition . The four session carry follow : ( 1 ) eye open stand firm surface , ( 2 ) eye close stand firm surface , ( 3 ) eye open stand foam surface , ( 4 ) eye close stand foam surface . These session random order repeat 4 time . During study visit , physician ask patient perform physical test Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) Hoehn Yahr ( H &amp; Y ) use assess severity patient 's Parkinson 's disease . Each assessment take place patient 's `` '' `` '' motor state . Instruments also use self-administered Freezing Gait Questionnaire ( FOGQ ) , evaluate walking difficulty , Gait-Falls diary , document indoor outdoor freezing , tripping , fall . To assess change mood , patient also complete follow instrument : Montgomery-Asberg Depression scale ( MADRS ) , 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS-15 ) 20-item Zung Self-Rating Depression scale ( Zung ) . To assess quality life activity daily live , patient complete EQ-5D Health Questionnaire . Finally , patient ask complete Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) document change sleep pattern . After first visit , patient begin four week increase medication order reach target dose . At fourth visit , patient receive opposite treatment receive first time another four-week increase medication take place . If Methylphenidate give first visit , patient receive placebo third visit vice versa . There three week period patient take study medication ( either Methylphenidate placebo ) , third fourth visit . At study visit , patient 's `` '' `` '' motor state , patient balance test . The physician evaluate severity patient 's disease use UPDRS H &amp; Y . Patients ask complete FOGQ Gait-Falls diary .</detailed_description>
