	<brief_summary>We wish investigate effect 3 week orally administer fish oil supplement airway sensitivity ( provoke dose cause 15 % fall FEV1 , PD15 ) inhale mannitol ( AridolTM ) . Mannitol , osmotic stimulus demonstrate useful model exercise-induced asthma . We also wish investigate associate improvement associate select marker airway inflammation measure sputum , blood , urine exhale breath condensate . Oral fish oil supplement recently demonstrate effective inhibitor exercise-induced asthma , association inhibition marker inflammation , 3 week treatment period . This finding important implication treatment asthma faster effective improvement see inhaled corticosteroid exercise-induced asthma . This observation require validation investigation . We wish study two patient group ; ( ) steroid na√Øve asthmatic take beta2 agonist require ( b ) asthmatic take regular inhaled corticosteroid &lt; 1000 mcg/day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Dietary Supplements With Fish Oil Mannitol-induced Airway Sensitivity &amp; Inflammation Persons With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma chronic inflammatory disorder airway characterize recurrent episode dyspnea , wheeze chest tightness associate variable airway obstruction . Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction ( EIB ) feature specific asthma . Exercise test protocol develop identify presence asthma well assess asthma therapy . Airway narrow follow exercise person asthma think result dry air hyperpnoea-induced dehydration airway surface , lead release mediator inflammatory cell reside airway . Regular treatment inhale corticosteroid inhibits airway response exercise decrease number inflammatory cell thus source bronchoconstricting mediator . Therefore , decrease source mediator may reason eventual inhibition airway response exercise . It recently demonstrate fish oil supplementation capsule form , take daily three week , provide significant protection EIB . This protection appear equal great efficacy inhaled corticosteroid treatment similar period . This may positive implication treatment asthma inhaled corticosteroid know unwanted side effect . Fish oil supplementation high dos give previous study demonstrate side effect may lead alternative treatment , decrease dose inhaled steroid require treatment asthma . A new bronchial provocation test use inhaled mannitol , derive mechanism EIB , recently develop registered Australia European Union . Mannitol cause airway narrowing similar manner exercise person asthma effective identifying responsiveness inhale corticosteroid . We wish use inhale mannitol model EIB effort investigate use fish oil supplementation treatment asthma . Our hypothesis daily orally administer encapsulated fish oil attenuate airway response mannitol 3-week treatment period . We also wish measure associate marker inflammation blood , urine , sputum exhale condensate well monitor clinical outcome symptoms daily beta2 agonist use .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female ( medically surgically postmenopausal practice accepted form barrier hormonal contraception ) subject age 1855 . Stable , mild atopic asthma force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) great 70 % predict age height , require medical treatment short act inhaled beta2agonists require steroid , take &lt; 1000 mcg inhale corticosteroid per day . No recent significant history cigarette smoking ( smoke within six month prior entry study ; le 10 packyears cumulative history cigarette smoking ) . Signed write informed consent participate study ; ability return clinic repeat visit . No history asthma exacerbation acute intercurrent respiratory illness ( viral respiratory syndrome , bronchitis , pneumonia ) four week period precede entry screen phase study . Subjects take inhales steroid regularly must demonstrate reproducibility inhale mannitol ( PD15 &lt; 1.0 double dos ) 2 week runin period . A PD15 mannitol challenge &lt; 315mg Significant gastrointestinal ( include hepatic ) , hematological , cardiovascular , cerebrovascular , metabolic include type II diabetes body system disorder . Regular consumption fish consist 1 meal fish per week regular fish oil supplement trial least 2 week prior first study visit . Subjects take oral corticosteroid leukotriene receptor antagonist 4 week prior entry study . Psychosis , alcoholism , active substance abuse , personality disorder , would make compliance protocol problematic . Pregnant nursing female . Any medical social condition , opinion investigator , could confound interpretation data derive study . Subjects take &gt; 1000 mcg inhale steroid daily subject take inhaled steroid . Subjects require regular antihistamine allergy . Subjects allergy fish ingredient study product . Subjects use anticoagulant ( warfarin , heparin ) Subjects surgery planned course trial . Subjects use medication low LDL cholesterol level Subjects use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication ( e.g. , aspirin , ibuprofen )</criteria>
