	<brief_title>Evaluating Physiological Markers Emotional Trauma : A Randomized Controlled Comparison Mind-Body Therapies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect emotional trauma physiological functioning document number study . The large ACE study , ( ACE=Adverse Childhood Experiences ) , examine health outcome 17,000 patient Kaiser Permanente Hospitals . It perform Kaiser collaboration Centers Disease Control , population median age 56 . The ACE study find patient high incidence Adverse Childhood Experiences ACEs high rate bone fracture , cancer , heart disease , hypertension , depression , smoking , suicide , diabetes , physical psychological ailment . The author study compare health care system 's focus treat disease adult fire brigade directing water smoke , rather originate fire . They recommend health care provider focus emotional trauma believe contribute many illness . The current study seek determine treatment emotional trauma effect physiological function . As marker physiological function , author study choose range motion joint upper body . Shoulder joint stiffness syndrome frozen shoulder typically take month even year heal , rapid resolution unusual , though injury indeed heal time . Range motion convenient marker physiological change measure accurately degree use goniometer , protractor-like device routinely use occupational therapy physical therapy . Changes treatment immediately note . The emotional trauma treatment modality investigate Emotional Freedom Techniques EFT , Diaphragmatic Breathing DB , DB group receive identical protocol DB substitute acupressure component EFT . They compare treatment control group . Studies EFT show therapy effective remove reduce emotional trauma , phobia , single brief treatment session , well reduce anxiety . The effect hold time . Most prior study use EFT treatment modality study effect one session , find EFT effective even brief course treatment . For current study , one 30 minute EFT treatment undertaken . The range motion shoulder joint record treatment license occupational therapist use goniometer . The Diaphragmatic Breathing protocol use second group verbal content identical EFT group , substitute DB acupressure . A follow assessment subject do 30 day . Range motion usually relapse , instead become great , follow conventional treatment , measure advantage require relatively short follow period , rather long period require physiological marker . The purpose study discover significant change range motion occur treatment , dismantle acupressure verbal component EFT substitute DB portion protocol .</detailed_description>
