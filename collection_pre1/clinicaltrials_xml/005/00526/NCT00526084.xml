	<detailed_description>In 1990s , five-year event-free survival rate childhood ALL generally range 70 83 percent develop country , overall cure rate approximately 80 percent . Emerging result suggest cure rate nearly 90 percent attain near future . Progress treatment ALL , however , make largely optimization use exist medicine rather discovery new agent . These factor predict clinical outcome include treatment regime , clinical feature , global gene expression pattern genetics leukemia cell , host pharmacodynamics pharmacogenetics , early response treatment . In Taiwan , detection recurrent fusion gene occur ALL popular apply yet . Minimal residual disease ( MRD ) detection commonly available evaluation initial response chemotherapy protocol assign . The TPOG ( Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group ) use clinical feature ( age , PB white blood count , immunophenotypes , cytogenetics ) assign protocol . Only around 60-70 % patient successful treat . The ultimate goal project establish method good risk classification pediatric ALL patient Taiwan order increase cure rate . Classification childhood ALL molecular method Risk factor base patient 's physical manifestation hematologic biochemical test largely replace specific test biologic feature leukemic cell . The recently introduce World Health Organization ( WHO ) classification take consideration morphologic immunologic feature plus well-studied , common nonrandom chromosomal abnormality clearly influence laboratory clinical feature ALL . Genetic makeup leukemic cell recognize important prognostic factor childhood ALL . The frequent fusion gene TEL-AML1 ( 25 % childhood B-ALL ) cause ( 12 ; 21 ) hyperdiploidy ( &gt; 50 chromosome ) ( account 25 % B-ALL ) notice associate favorable prognosis . The recurrent chromosome translocation changes/fusion gene ( 4 ; 11 ) /MLL-AF4 , ( 9:22 ) /BCR-ABL , ( 1 ; 19 ) /E2A-PBX1 recognize adverse prognostic factor . Recently , treatment ( 1 ; 19 ) B-ALL high dose chemotherapy give successful result . Cytogenetic analysis standard method identify chromosomal translocation childhood ALL many year . However , approach technically difficult take least two week obtain result . Undetermined result inevitable substantial proportion case . This prevalent patient ( 12 ; 21 ) , visible routine cytogenetics examination . A multiplex RT-PCR assay detection common chimeric transcript TEL-AML1 , MLL/AF4 , BCR-ABL , E2A-PBX1 design classify pediatric ALL patient . The application assay routine clinical screening significantly improve clinical diagnosis childhood ALL . Prediction therapy-resistant leukemia clone -- -global gene expression pattern leukemic cell Recent work indicate global gene expression profile use DNA microarrays identify gene level expression relate drug response . Significant difference expression gene involve cell-cycle regulation , DNA repair , apoptosis notice diagnostic early relapse sample therapy-sensitive therapy-resistant sample . These discovery provide mean enhance classification system base relapse hazard identify signal pathway wound potentially target novel therapy . Holleman A et al use microarrays investigate expression 70 apoptosis gene reveal BCL2L13 expression independent prognostic factor . Flotho C et al analyze gene expression diagnostic lymphoblast compare finding MRD level day 19 46 remission induction therapy . Seventeen gene identify significantly associate MRD . Caspase 8-associated protein 2 gene ( CASP8AP2 ) study show strong relationship prognosis . The study Cario et al demonstrate low expression TTK associate poor treatment response presence MRD day 19 46 chemotherapy . These study demonstrate association apoptosis pathways treatment prognosis treatment failure . These gene may serve functionally-defined risk factor treatment stratification addition currently use risk factors.Recent evidence indicate small non-protein-coding RNA molecule , microRNAs ( miRNAs ) , might function tumor suppressor oncogenes . A recent report Cimmino et al show miR-15a miR-16-1 negatively regulate anti-apoptotic gene BCL2 . Therefore , think deletion down-regulation mir-15a mir-16-1 promotes leukaemogenesis lymphomagenesis haematopoietic cell . These study hint oncogenesis role miRNA might play . A report Sonoki et a. also link mir-125b-1 leukemia . A recent report Lu J et al . find expression profile relatively miRNAs ( ~200 gene ) , accurately classify human cancer . They examine miRNA profile 73 bone marrow sample obtain child acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Hierarchical cluster reveal non-random partitioning sample three major branch . This patter similar classification drawn microarray analysis . Therefore , expect different microRNA profile could associate drug resistancein childhood ALL . Host pharmacogenetics genetic polymorphism associate drug metabolism , disposition , chemotherapy cross-resistance , complication Genetic polymorphisms drug-metabolizing enzyme ( drug transporter ) drug target ALL patient influence efficacy toxicity antileukemic agent . The intriguing example pharmacogenomic application thiopurine S-methyltransferase ( TPMT ) . The purine analog antimetabolite , Azathioprine 6-mercaptopurine ( 6MP ) , interfere nucleic acid metabolism cell proliferation use treat leukemia . Thiopurine S-methyltransferase ( TPMT ) cytosolic enzyme preferentially catalyzes S-methylation inactivation purine analog . About 90 % white black person high TPM activity , 10 % intermediate activity cause heterozygosity TPMT locus . About 1 300 person inherits TPMT deficiency . Clinical study establish inverse correlation TPMT activity accumulation active thioguanine nucleotide metabolites mercaptopurine azathioprine erythrocyte . Accumulation nucleotides usually lead severe hematopoietic toxicity possibly death , outcome avert thiopurine dose decrease substantially ( 8- 15-fold reduction ) . Patients intermediate TPMT activity intermediate risk toxicity . To avoid bone marrow toxicity TPMT deficiency patient , prospective measurement erythrocyte TPMT activity prior therapy advocate . However , TPMT assay easily available . The genetic basis TPMT deficiency define polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -based method , well establish diagnose TPMT deficiency heterozygosity Western country adjustment thiopurine dose . Recently , TPMT genotype link early ALL treatment response ( MRD day 78 remission-induction therapy include mercaptopurine 4 week ) . Other germ line polymorphism MTX associate gene plausibly link drug resistance prognosis childhood ALL current regime . It may also affect development de novo therapy-related leukemia . The polymorphisms folate-related gene MTHFR , MTRR , SHMT1 report relate resistance methotrexate childhood ALL . Rocha JC et al . find GSTM1 non-null TYMS 3/3 genotype link drug resistance . It important investigate common polymorphism patient Taiwan . We detect polymorphisms Taiwan pediatric patient reveal relationship outcome complication . Methods monitor early response chemotherapy Response therapy reflect genetics leukemia cell pharmacodynamics pharmacogenetics host , great prognostic strength biologic clinical feature test date . The measurement minimal residual disease , use either flow cytometry quantitative reverse transcription polymerase-chain-reaction ( Q-RT-PCR ) analysis , affords level sensitivity specificity attain traditional morphologic assessment . A simplified flow cytometric assay CD19 , CD10 , CD34 antigens bone marrow mononuclear cell day 14 21 remission induction therapy would provide mean achieve goal MRD detection could readily apply center minimal laboratory resource ( Coustan-Smith E et al ) . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Experimental Design A total 160 ALL patient recruit study well age-matched control . Patients newly diagnose ALL enrol TPOG ALL 2002 protocols previously diagnose patient past 3 year recruit parent ' informed consent . For patient , prepare total RNA genomic DNA sample form blast cell initial diagnostic sample ( leukemic cell bone marrow aspiration peripheral blood ) . Multiplex RT-PCR recurrent BCR-ABL , MLL-AF4 , E2A-PBX1 , TEL-AML1 fusion gene setup specific initial prognostic factor assignment ALL patient . We also analyze relationship presence 16 genetic polymorphism 6 important drug-metabolizing gene ( CYP3A4*1B ( A &gt; G position -392 ) CYP3A5*3 ( G &gt; A position 22893 ) ; GSTP1 313A &gt; G , GSTM1 deletion GSTT1 deletion ; MDR1 exon 21 ( 2677G &gt; T/A ) MDR1 exon 26 ( 3435C &gt; T ) ; MTHFR 677C &gt; T MTHFR 1298A &gt; C ; NR3C1 1088A &gt; G ; RFC 80G &gt; A ; TPMT 238G &gt; C , TPMT 460G &gt; A , TPMT 719A &gt; G ; TYMS enhancer repeat ; UGT1A1 promoter repeat polymorphism ; VDR intron 8 G &gt; A , VDR FokI ( start-site ) T &gt; C ) influence pharmacodynamics anti-leukemic agent receive ALL eill investigated.After induction chemotherapy , flow cytometric assay detect MRD level apply reflect early response initial chemotherapy protocol . A residual disease level le 0.01 percent completion initial remission-induction therapy reliably identifies patient exceptionally good treatment outcome . By contrast , patient level 1 percent end remission-induction therapy level 0.1 percent later times high risk relapse . Patients residual leukemia level 0.01 percent six week remission-induction therapy manage intensified therapy protocol seek hematopoietic stem cell transplantation donors.The expression profile 12 gene associate prognosis assay ( CASP8AP2 , PTTG1 , BCL2L13 BIRC5 ( survivin ) , HRK TOP2A , TTK , CCNB1 , TNF , RAB5C , BCL7A GRP58 ) . MicroRNA array profile apply also . Clinical course acute chronic complicationswill follow recorded assess relationship polymorphisms clinical course .</detailed_description>
