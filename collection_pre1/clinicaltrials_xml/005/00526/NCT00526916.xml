	<brief_title>PET Imaging Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptors Patients With Neurocysticercosis Using C-11PBR28</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective In endemic region neurocysticercosis common cause adult acquire epilepsy thus important public health problem . The disease cause infection larval form tapeworm , Taenia solium . Although neurocysticercosis common many develop region , increase number patient diagnose developed country mostly due immigration infect individual . The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBR ) clinically useful marker detect neuroinflammation activate microglia inflammatory area express much great level PBR microglia rest condition . PBR image positron emission tomography ( PET ) use [ ( 11 ) C ] 1- ( 2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl ) -3-isoquinoline carboxamide ( PK11195 ) , provide low level specific signal . Recently develop new ligand , [ ( 11 ) C ] N-acetyl-N- ( 2-methoxybenzyl ) -2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine ( PBR28 ) , show much great specific signal [ ( 11 ) C ] PK11195 non-human primate . The major objective protocol assess utility [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 PET detect neuroinflammation patient neurocysticercosis . Study population Thirty patient recruit clinically follow protocol 85-I-0127 , Treatment Cysticercosis include Neurocysticercosis Praziquantel Albendazole , ( PI : Theodore E. Nash , MD , NIAID ) . Thirty healthy subject recruit . Design Fifteen patient neurocysticercosis first 15 age-matched healthy subject brain PET scan . Patients three [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 PET scan follow-up treatment 85-I-0127 , typically week apart . Outcome measure PBR28 binding compare clinical symptom MRI finding . In addition , bind compare patient age-matched control subject high level specific binding may allow detection increase PBR region MRI detect inflammation .</detailed_description>
