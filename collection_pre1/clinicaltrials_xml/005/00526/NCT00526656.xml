	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sunitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving sunitinib surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well sunitinib work treat patient locally advanced bladder cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine pathologic complete response rate sunitinib malate patient muscle-invasive locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) bladder . - To evaluate safety tolerability sunitinib malate administer prior radical cystectomy , include surgical outcome surgical complication . Secondary - To determine clinical effect sunitinib malate administer prior radical cystectomy bilateral lymph node dissection , include overall response rate use RECIST define criterion , cytology , histologic appearance surgical specimen well time progression . Tertiary - To assess pre-treatment tissue baseline angiogenic marker evaluate magnitude difference among variable post-treatment tumor tissue neoadjuvant sunitinib malate . - To evaluate effect sunitinib malate immunosuppressive regulatory T cell . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily week 1-4 ( 1 course ) . Patients undergo restaging within 1 week prior surgery undergo radical cystectomy bilateral lymph node dissection day 42 . Patients achieve complete pathologic response time surgery may receive 6 course adjuvant sunitinib malate begin 28 day surgery discretion treat physician . Patients find high-risk feature ( i.e . pT3 great tumor evidence disease lymph node resect ) offer standard adjuvant systemic chemotherapy discretion treat physician . Tumor tissue pretreatment biopsy radical cystectomy test VEGFR-1 , VEGFR-2 PDGF-R expression IHC . Samples also analyze quantification cell proliferation apoptosis immunosuppressive regulatory T cell ( T-reg ) T-reg function . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day surgery .</detailed_description>
