	<detailed_description>Background Low back pain usual condition western country Norway 40 % population report decrease function back pain . The disease great economic consequence , 2004 come 15 billion disability pension 1,46 billion physical treatment . Severe incidence back pain , like tumour , infection , fracture pareses rare represent le 1 % case . The main part within category `` non-specific low back pain '' , define back pain without specific pathology know cause . Based scientific documentation back-specialists consider non-specific low back pain benign self-limited condition , patient expect get treatment experience condition painful disabling . There several treatment available patient `` non-specific low back pain '' . According European guideline exercise cognitive intervention good effect pain function ( www.backpaineurope.org ) , documented effect return work . In addition document treatment focus single treatment neither effective regard return work sick-listed patient . It usual myth physical hard work cause back pain . However , study demonstrate correlation hard work sick-leave . On contrary several study demonstrate back pain multifactorial problem , due worker ' characteristic , also closely related environmental factor , workplace , healthcare system , compensation system interaction stakeholder disability problem . The challenge health personnel cure patient back pain , build rehabilitation program focus disability work incapacity patient risk loose work . Dr. P. Loisel , Montreal , Canada '' , since 1995 treat patient back pain accord `` The PREVICAP model - ( PREVention work handICAP ) '' . The main purpose work-related program prevent prolong disability help patient back work . This approach include two step : first identification factor workplace contribute absence work second `` workplace intervention '' . Identification factor workplace include physical , ergonomic , psychosocial , interpersonal conflict administrative problem . `` Workplace intervention '' rehabilitation program centre workplace , allow grade transition clinical setting workplace . Parallel workplace intervention patient enter exercise-program , adjusted workplace intervention . The PREVICAP model evaluate randomize controlled trial accelerate return work factor 2.4 ( p=0.01 ) . The important effect come workplace intervention , alone accelerated return work factor 1.9 ( p=0.01 ) . Patients randomized PREVICAP model 60 day absence work , compare 120 day control group . The PREVICAP model evaluate Amsterdam , Dr. Anema demonstrate significant difference return work rate patient randomize `` Workplace intervention '' patient randomize usual treatment . At Back Clinic , Ullevål University Hospital evaluate several exercise-programs good effect pain function , return work rate . This raise important question : return work rate increase include workplace intervention exercise program possible implement PREVICAP model Norway good result , despite difference Canada , The Netherlands Norway regard culture , soc-economic condition , work condition compensatory system . We plan randomize controlled trial PREVICAP model , patient sick-listed back pain randomize either workplace intervention plus exercise-program exercise-program alone . Purpose The purpose project answer follow question : 1 . Will patient return work faster , include work-related rehabilitation program patient randomize usual care general practitioner , follow-up 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 1 2 year . 2 . Was significant difference pain function two group follow-up ? 3 . Which factor predict return work ; medical , socioeconomic factor workplace ? 4 . At 2 year follow-up- Had patient episodes back pain case , many , duration sick-listed stay work ? 5 . Is favorable cost benefit program ? The study prospective single-blind randomize study . The patient randomize block-randomisation . The randomization carry separate location conceal clinical investigator . Inclusions criterion : Patients non-specific low back pain sick list 6-8 week permanently employ . Non-specific low back pain define back pain attributable recognizable , know specific pathology . Exclusions criterion : Patients infection , tumor , osteoporosis , fracture , structural deformity , inflammatory disorder , radicular syndrome cauda equina syndrome , spinal stenosis spondylolysis/ listesis , serious somatic disease and/or psychic disease patient poor proficiency Norwegian . All patient clinical examination specialist exercise program . The patient randomize workplace intervention control group . Patients randomize workplace intervention refer occupational ergonomist work site evaluation return work program , include ergonomic condition relation employer colleague . The occupational task ergonomists organize contact meeting employer patient make schedule return work . Patients randomize control group go back general practitioner plan return work . Sample size : together 260 patient study . Ethics The study follow ethic direction Helsinki Declaration initiate approval National Committee Research Ethics Norway . In addition also ask permission collect register data Data Inspectorate Norway . Only patient give informed consent include informed withdraw study time otherwise consequence treatment . Registrations drop-outs The moment time cause drop-outs register . We attempt obtain clinical examination drop-outs 1-year follow-up . Data analyse statistic analysis All data anonymous cod registered electronic SPSS . They unidentified analysis presentation . Parametric analyse apply data , normally distribute else , non-parametric statistic use . Survival analysis use investigate difference reduction sickness leave two treatment group . Multivariate analysis use identify difference pain , function fear avoidance two group . In addition analyse data patient complete trial , data dropout analyse accord intention-to-treat principle . Preconditions Back Clinic conduction study The Back Clinic , Ullevål University Hospital collaboration Compensation system Oslo , NAV ( Norges Arbeids-og Velferdsetat ) . The surplus Back Clinic use employ occupational ergonomist . The physiotherapist employee Back Clinic try exercise program . Principal investigator ( Anne Keller ) apply grant post doc fellowship . The Back clinic test laboratory bicycle test submaximal oxygen uptake inclinometer measure range motion flexion back . We collaboration Department neuroradiology MRI investigation .</detailed_description>
