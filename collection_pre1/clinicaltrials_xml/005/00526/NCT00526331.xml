	<detailed_description>THE EDWARDS VIGILEO MONITOR : The Vigileo™ monitor measure amount blood heart pump body . SCREENING TEST : Before begin study , `` screen test '' help doctor decide eligible take part study . Women able child must negative urine pregnancy test . STUDY GROUP : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) either Control Group Study Group . You equal chance assign either group . You know group assign . STUDY PARTICIPATION : You arterial catheter ( small plastic tube ) insert artery inside wrist begin surgery . This use routinely ( even patient take part study ) measure blood pressure accurately rather blood pressure cuff . It insert receive general anesthesia ( numbing medicine ) , feel pain . If insert awake ( base judgment anesthesiologist ) , local anesthesia give reduce discomfort . If doctor decide arterial catheter require part routine medical care surgery , place one study purpose . In situation , remove study , medical care continue plan doctor . If catheter place , Vigileo™ monitor connect catheter reading take surgery . It disconnect end surgery . If Study Group , doctor use monitor routine vital sign measurement decide much fluid give surgery . If Control Group , doctor know information collect monitor , collect compare information collect participant Study Group . The amount fluid receive surgery decide routine vital sign measurement , standard care . ESOPHAGEAL DOPPLER : Regardless study group assignment , surgery , researcher also connect esophageal doppler also collect data fluid volume . The esophageal doppler thin , tube-like device place throat asleep . This use routinely doctor assist administration fluid surgery . The information doppler compare information collect Vigileo™ monitor . The esophageal doppler measure blood flow heart ultrasound wave . LENGTH OF STUDY : You consider study leave recovery room . FOLLOW-UP : Researchers collect information progress surgery , include allow leave hospital . Your medical record review surgery 6 month surgery see medical problem . The kind information researcher collect amount time intensive care ( ) , amount time hospital , complication problem may , well organs functioning , general health information . This investigational study . The Vigileo™ Monitor esophageal doppler FDA approve commercially available volume monitoring . The comparison monitor doppler investigational . Up 218 patient enrol multi-center study . Up 66 enrolled M.D . Anderson .</detailed_description>
