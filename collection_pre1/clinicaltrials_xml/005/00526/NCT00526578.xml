	<brief_title>Pancreatic Cancer Genetic Epidemiology ( PACGENE ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants study part pancreatic cancer genetic epidemiology consortium ( herein refer `` PACGENE '' ) , include researcher institution : Mayo Clinic ; Johns Hopkins University ; Creighton University ; University Toronto Mount Sinai Hospital ; Dana Farber ; Karmanos Cancer Institute . Participants either diagnosed pancreatic cancer family member pancreatic cancer patient . Participants ask question train interviewer use approved questionnaire .

Participants study also one half tablespoon blood drawn . Blood collect used researcher involve study . If obtain blood sample possible , study staff ask saliva sample use ORAGENE kit . Neither participant physician receive individual report research . Results place participant 's health record . All information keep confidential use research . There rare chance research team member could accidentally expose blood body fluid . If occurs , extra blood ( 2 teaspoon ) may draw test infection hepatitis HIV ( AIDS virus ) . An exist blood sample may use test instead . You tell blood test result test . Researchers ask would like receive result , phone certify letter . The test result name , address , date birth , sex record confidential M. D. Anderson medical record . If test positive hepatitis HIV , test result name , address , date birth , sex share appropriate health authority require law . You also give list place area receive test treatment . For protection privacy , study staff obtain Certificate Confidentiality National Institutes Health . With certificate , researcher force disclose information may identify , even court subpoena , federal , state , local civil , criminal , administrative , legislative , proceeding . The researcher use certificate resist demand information would identify , except explain . The certificate use resist demand information personnel United State Government use audit evaluation Federally fund project information must disclose order meet requirement federal Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . You understand Certificate Confidentiality prevent member family voluntarily release information involvement research . If insurer , employer , person obtains write consent receive research information , researcher may use certificate withhold information . This investigational study . This study include total 1,000 participant recruit M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
