	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) currently fourth lead cause death United States . COPD characterize reduce airflow largely irreversible progressive . Smoking recognize important cause COPD contribute 80 % case . The disease demonstrate significant variability airflow obstruction progression disease among diagnosed treat . This probably due role exposure cigarette smoke noxious inhaled particle gas also individual 's varied response exposure . COPD characterize inflammatory response number component may present variable amount . Recent data suggest cigarette exposure may cause several distinct pathophysiological process turn may account variability demonstrate altered lung structure lead functional impairment . Current therapies help alleviation symptom individual unaltered course loss lung function frequently lead respiratory failure death . New strategy discuss mean new therapeutic approach alter course disease . The use genomic proteomic methodology offer promise identify pathways critical relevant progression COPD . To date approve medication target inflammatory response disease . The study explore metabolic pathway could affect remodel process associate disease . Because heterogeneity COPD , characteristic individual well individual must identify detail . Mechanisms enable include physiological characterization current prescribed intervention also image data provide ability quantify airway wall thickness well via DNA collect save order gain well understanding methodology relate characterization COPD . Currently , may common understand particular drug affect detail molecular mechanism , however frequently know . The purpose study assist discovery .</detailed_description>
