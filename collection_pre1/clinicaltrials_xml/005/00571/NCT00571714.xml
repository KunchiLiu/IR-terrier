	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study compare safety effectiveness standard treatment chronic hepatitis C use peginterferon alpha-2a ( Pegasys ) ribavirin ( Copegus ) medication plus dietary supplement call betaine add first 12 week treatment . Peginterferon alpha-2a ( Pegasys ) ribavirin ( Copegus ) approve FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) treatment chronic hepatitis C. Betaine dietary supplement occur naturally body . It medication regulate FDA approve drug chronic hepatitis C .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Comparison Standard Antiviral Therapy With Without 12 Weeks Betaine Genotype 1 Naive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although pegylated alpha interferon ribavirin likely part core therapy chronic HCV next several year , number complimentary antiviral agent development include protease polymerase inhibitor , RNA vaccines immunomodulators ( 5 ) . However , would unlikely FDA approval newer agent next 3 - 5 year , i.e . 2010-2012 . Betaine , naturally occur anti-oxidant metabolite choline amino acid analog ( tri-methyl-glycine ) , serve methylation agent re-methylate damage cell protein enzyme ( 6 ) . By virtue metabolic role decrease toxic metabolite , betaine also protect alcohol-induced fatty liver apoptosis . Recently , pilot study perform Mayo Clinic UNMC show applicability treatment non-alcoholic fatty liver human subject ( 7 , 8 ) . Betaine also recently find promote interferon function overcome HCV - induced inhibition interferon signal ( 9 ) . Naturally-occurring HCV proteins human infection hypo-methylate proteins integral Jak - STAT ( signal transducer activator transcription ) pathway , thereby inhibit antiviral activity interferon . In cultured cell betaine administration , physiologically attainable concentration , restore STAT methylation improve interferon signaling ( 9 ) .</detailed_description>
