	<detailed_description>Because rapid growth first year life , infant high risk develop iron deficiency ( ID ) even iron deficiency anaemia ( IDA ) . Iron metabolism infancy seem immature affect developmental change yet fully understood . Therefore study , detailed dietary intake full set biomarkers characterize iron status risk IDA welcome . LC-PUFA , especially docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA , n-3 ) , important meaning infants´ neural development neural tissue unique pattern FA . DHA predominantly find brain retina . LC-PUFA either supply preform diet convert essential precursor polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) linoleic acid ( LA , n-6 ) α-linolenic acid ( ALA , n-3 ) organism dependent ratio n-6/n-3 FA diet . In case iron well PUFA LC-PUFA little known nutritional supply effect status second half first year life . Therefore objective DINO examine feasibility increase meat exchange n-6 rich corn oil vs. n-3 rich rapeseed oil common commercial menu examine effect iron status blood FA pattern respectively primary outcome variable double-blinded randomize control intervention trial ( RCT ) .</detailed_description>
