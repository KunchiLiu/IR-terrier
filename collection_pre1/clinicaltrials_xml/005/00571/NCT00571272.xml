	<brief_summary>Cholestasis condition bile properly transport liver small intestine . Cholestasis cause array childhood disease , include genetic disease Alagille syndrome ( ALGS ) , alpha-1 antitrypsin ( a-1AT ) deficiency , bile acid synthesis metabolism defect , progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis ( PFIC ) benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis ( BRIC ) . This study investigate natural history progression four previously mention cholestatic liver disease provide good understanding cause effect disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cholestasis rare condition involve reduction obstruction bile flow liver small intestine . When bile flow hinder , waste product pigment call bilirubin escape bloodstream build harmful level . This may lead easily recognizable cholestatic symptom jaundice , itching , impaired growth eventually serious health problem . Four rare genetic liver disorders— ALGS , a-1AT , bile acid synthesis metabolism defect , PFIC—account 20 % 30 % infant case cholestasis . These four disorder compose group related disease cause significant growth problem childhood , serious liver problem , need liver transplantation , potentially death . More research rare liver disease necessary develop scientific basis improvement diagnostic technique treatment . Current diagnostic procedure complex , development simpler diagnostic test would facilitate early diagnosis treatment . This study investigate natural history progression four previously mention cholestatic liver disease provide good understanding cause effect disease . Participation study last 10 year consist baseline visit five annual follow-up visit . The study enroll infant adults 25 year age , suspect , one four genetic cholestatic liver disease . Individuals sibling a-A1T participant underlie disease evidence liver involvement may also enrol . Study visit involve review clinical information , family history , clinically indicated treatment outcomes ; physical exam ; laboratory test ; radiologic imaging evaluation . In addition standard care evaluation , participant undergo several special research evaluation , include quality life questionnaire , neurodevelopmental evaluation , hear exam , DEXA scanning ( dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ) , liver histology study , collection serum , plasma , urine , blood DNA cell line . Serum , plasma , urine , blood DNA cell line also collect biological parent affect siblings participant a-A1T ALGS . Genetic test perform use collect specimen .</detailed_description>
