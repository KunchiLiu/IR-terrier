	<brief_summary>This randomize double blind control study determine celebrex ( celecoxib ) , selective COX-2 inhibitor , decrease rate recurrence adult pediatric patient recurrent respiratory papillomatosis . All patient evaluate disease severity enrollment 3 month interval 30 month . After randomization , patient early treatment arm begin celecoxib 6 month enrollment . The delayed treatment arm begin celecoxib 18 month enrollment . All patient receive celecoxib 1 year . During time patient receive celecoxib , receive placebo capsule appearance . Follow-up visit occur three month interval duration study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Celebrex ( Celecoxib ) Patients With Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize double blind placebo-controlled study , plan include 5 additional U.S. center near future . The primary goal study determine whether celecoxib efficacy elimination reduction recurrent disease patient RRP . Our secondary goal determine whether continued celecoxib require maintain response , correlate response select patient demographic plasma level celecoxib . The study design encompass 30-month period , divide three segment : Segment A : This 6 month run-in period patient assess direct laryngoscopy/bronchoscopy disease severity , permit growth rate stabilization confirm accuracy train participate physician . Patients treat conventional surgery three month six month enrollment . Segment B : Patients begin 12 month 400mg ( adult ) , 100 mg ( pediatric weight 12 25 kg ) 200 mg ( pediatric weight &gt; 25kg ) celecoxib daily placebo treatment addition surgical removal papillomas 3 month interval . This segment directly test hypothesis celecoxib efficacious treatment moderate severe RRP form basis primary statistical analysis . Segment C : The primary purpose segment determine whether gain make celecoxib therapy maintain discontinue , whether celecoxib need take indefinitely . This determine 12 month period placebo cessation celecoxib early treatment group . This traditional cross-over study expect sustained effect therefore efficacy study do segment C. However , placebo first group give celecoxib could gain possible benefit equivalent receive celecoxib first .</detailed_description>
