	<brief_summary>Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) vary body position , significant increase occur seated supine position . Previous research indicate IOP increase explain change episcleral venous pressure ( blood flow lead away eye ) alone . As well , previous research indicate aqueous flow rate independent body position . The purpose project determine aqueous humor outflow facility vary change posture .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>On day experiment , patient ask maintain regular schedule normal activity . This include avoid excess caffeine intake , large deviation normal sleep cycle , exposure pharmacologic IOP modifying agent . Subjects seat standard ophthalmologic examine chair recline supine position quiet room subdue light approximately 5 minute . Anesthesia achieve instill 3-4 drop 0.5 % proparacaine . The contralateral eye patch air-tight fashion adhesive eye patch reduce evaporative loss dry cornea . The patient ask keep eye close prior start measurement . When ready , patient ask open eye observe dim fixation target place ceiling room , roughly 6 foot patient 's eye . Baseline IOP ( Po ) measure use pneumatonometer ( Model 30 Classic Mentor ) . Tonography perform use electronic Schiotz tonometer 10g weight order obtain four minute tracing . The procedure repeat contralateral eye , patch already test eye . After , patient 's chair raise 70 degree patient ask hyperextend neck cornea parallel floor . A minimum 30 minute allow elapse , allow autonomic , postural hormonal change stabilize . Then repeat baseline IOP sit position take another 4 minute tracing collect successively eye describe . Data tonometer trace collect electronically export standard Excel file . A smooth curve best fit establish tonogram graph , correct oscillation drift . This curve help determine adequacy collect sample . Tracings poorly fit curve might occur variety reason include patient tenseness anxiety , uncontrollable tendency fall asleep incidental interruption sudden wave intestinal peristalsis . Corresponding `` Po '' value initial steady-state IOP `` C '' value facility aqueous outflow gather refer standard table normograms . The main potential risk participate study possibility corneal abrasion . Previous study Mayo Clinic use technique result corneal abrasion 300 eye 150 patient . Based result , estimate risk corneal abrasion minimal . If corneal abrasion occur , patient remove study . The patient treat antibiotic drop ointment follow abrasion completely heal . Other minor risk include possible allergic reaction anesthetic drop adhesive glue . As medication , allergic reaction possibility . However , drop use routine clinical practice , allergic reaction extremely uncommon .</detailed_description>
