	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose arsenic trioxide give together disulfiram treating patient metastatic progressive melanoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , disulfiram arsenic trioxide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Disulfiram Plus Arsenic Trioxide In Patients With Metastatic Melanoma Least One Prior Systemic Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate tolerability disulfiram arsenic trioxide administration therapeutic combination . ( Phase IB ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : l. Determine response rate ( complete partial response ) time progression previously treat patient metastatic malignant melanoma treat disulfiram plus Arsenic Trioxide . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study arsenic trioxide . Patients receive disulfiram orally ( PO ) twice daily arsenic trioxide intravenously ( IV ) 1-2 hour Monday Friday , alternate two week treatment follow two week treatment . Courses repeat every 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
