	<detailed_description>Some patient autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) intractable disable chronic kidney pain . Among method use manage patient , removal nerve supply kidney Videothoracoscopic excision Splanchnic nerve ( videothoracoscopic splanchnicectomy â€” VSPL ) one promising procedure . Few procedure perform ADPKD patient ( one patient use less invasive thoracic approach ) . We recently perform VSPL two patient chronic pain . Both initial improvement short follow . This study improve understand molecular mechanism mediator kidney pain provide hope effective procedure ADPKD patient chronic kidney pain . We enrol patient study effectiveness VSPL operation , collect information pain intensity , quality life , kidney blood flow , kidney/cyst volume also study involve pain pathway . Baseline Visit - The patient also complete physical exam kidney 's filtration rate measure . Urine blood test perform evaluation . You MRI perform kidney . There radiation exposure associate procedure . You also ask complete Quality Life ( QOL ) , HALT Pain , Depression Score questionnaire . These take approximately 15 minute complete repeat evaluation . The VSPL operation do within approximately 1 week Baseline Visit consider part clinical care part research.In procedure surgeon approach nerve supply kidney chest wall , use 3 small incision . He locate nerve , cut piece remove chest cavity.You release hospital pain control oral medication . 1 Month Visit-You ask return Mayo Clinic one month VSPL procedure physical exam completion questionnaires.If unable return Mayo Clinic evaluation do local doctor . 3 Month Visit-The 3 Month Visit identical Baseline visit .
