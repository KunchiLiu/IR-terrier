	<detailed_description>IMPACT ON VETERANS HEALTH It anticipate intervention help participate veteran achieve optimal hypertension ( HTN ) control . Doing reduce risk heart disease stroke , improve quality life . It hop collaborative nature intervention strengthen Department Veterans Affairs ( VA ) 's tie veteran community , establish important `` partnership health . '' If successful , intervention could serve model manage chronic disease within outside VA system . BACKGROUND/RATIONALE Despite consensus effective hypertension treatment reduces morbidity mortality , many patient United States continue suboptimal blood pressure control . Even provider resource motivate patient inherent randomized clinical trial , third patient participate Antihypertensive Lipid-Lowering Treatment Prevent Heart Attack Trial ( ALLHAT ) goal blood pressure 140/90 five year . Similarly , within Veterans Integrated Service Network ( VISN ) 12 find many 30 % patient hypertension target BP 140/90 , despite routine physician reminder patient goal . Moreover , preliminary result internally fund randomized trial suggest minimal impact physician-focused intervention reduce patient ' blood pressure . OBJECTIVES We two primary objective . First , intervention propose novel , believe need demonstrate efficacy methodologically rigorous fashion . Specifically plan demonstrate veteran participate peer support intervention improve blood pressure control , knowledge blood pressure treatment , generally , active stance patient . Second , carefully examine process intervention achieve goal , include examine key structural variable frequency peer support meeting , attendance participant meeting , use healthcare professional support group leader . As part second objective , also seek understand fidelity peer leader deliver intervention , satisfaction support group participants leader intervention . METHODS There three primary activity present project . First , academicians Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center ( VAMC ) work Veterans Foreign Wars ( VFW ) community group develop community-academic partnership follow principle community-based participatory research . This key activity underway continue beyond present period funding . Second , centerpiece present grant cluster randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) use peer-led support group improve BP control patient hypertension . Fifty post drawn VFW , American Legion , Vietnam Veterans Association , National Association Black Veterans randomly assign receive professionally deliver education regard hypertension peer support intervention . The third activity evaluation process involve deliver peer support intervention allow successful replication , provide insight expect improvement BP control occur .</detailed_description>
