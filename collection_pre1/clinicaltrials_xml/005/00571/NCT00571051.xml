Study assessment visit Martinos Center facility Charlestown In study , 3 study assessment visit Martinos Center facility Charlestown volunteer ask question daily experience . At 3 study visit , investigator also record magnetic field reading brain use non-invasive imaging technique know magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) . MEG technique measure small electrical current produce cell brain active . This activity sometimes call `` brain wave . '' During recording , also lightly touch volunteer ' left hand leave foot plastic knob . We ask volunteer tell u think stimulus . To help u interpret MEG magnetic field reading , volunteer 's first visit also use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) create image his/her brain . MRI technique use magnetic field align spin atom water molecule . It create image brain activity tiny amount energy release atom relax normal state . Structural MRI give u information anatomy brain . At 3 study visit , subject begin brain scan , he/she ask complete two test . The first test assistant lightly press plastic dome his/her fingertip . The domes groove , he/she ask tell u way groove point . The second test ask him/her find number appear screen flash letter . Volunteers also give question daily experience . In addition , visit 2 3 , subject assign receive MBSR , investigator ask experience MBSR practice . Schedule assessment procedures visit 1-3 : - Visit 1 involves follow procedure : - Receiving magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain scan . - Doing dome test number test - Filling brief questionnaire activity perform hand , feeling experience general . - Undergoing magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) record brain function . - Visit 2 involve follow procedure : - Doing dome test number test - Filling brief questionnaire feeling experience general feeling experience related MBSR . - Undergoing magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) record brain function . - Visit 3 involve follow procedure : - Doing dome test number test - Filling brief questionnaire feeling experience general feeling experience related MBSR . - Undergoing magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) record brain function . Each 3 study visit Martinos Center last 2 hour 30 minute . Optional MBSR class subject assign waitlist If subject assign waitlist , he/she option enrol free MBSR class completion study visit Martinos Center . This free class taught chief mindfulness teacher certify MBSR instructor . This free class offer courtesy expression thanks participate study . This free class research study : research data collect courtesy class ; subject free participate refuse participate post-study optional class .</detailed_description>
