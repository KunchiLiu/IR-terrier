	<brief_summary>The main purpose protocol study effect HIV medication , Kaletra ( lopinavir/ritonavir ) , buprenorphine non-HIV infected people receive dose buprenorphine least 3 week . Study Hypothesis : Kaletra ( lopinavir/ritonavir ) increase buprenorphine plasma level without significant clinical effect subject need dose adjustment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Buprenorphine ( BUP ) partial opiate agonist dose sublingually supervise opiate withdrawal maintenance opiate dependence . Until recently , methadone mainstay pharmacological treatment opiate-dependent person HIV infection . In October , 2002 , buprenorphine ( BUP ) approve opiate maintenance prescribe primary care physician . It anticipate many HIV specialist begin prescribe BUP HIV+ patient ARVs history opiate dependence . This continue increase importance method treatment patient population follow reason : 1 ) Multiple federal program work encourage use BUP primary care , especially HIV primary care , setting . The goal program increase opiate treatment slot across country . 2 ) Many methadone program wait list regulation ( e.g. , daily dose ) may possible patient . BUP , flexibility dose ease use , increasingly become first line treatment opioid dependence . Buprenorphine administration carry theoretical risk drug interaction respect inhibition induction BUP well similar effect medication co-administered BUP . Interactions may lead overdose buprenorphine and/or antiretroviral agent resultant adverse clinical consequence . Buprenorphine 's effect Kaletra ARVs predict base prior experience methadone BUP metabolism appear differ methadone term substrate effect cytochrome P450 . Limited information currently exist regard interaction HIV therapeutic agent buprenorphine . Similar buprenorphine , protease inhibitor , NNRTIs metabolize primarily via CYP3A4 isozyme cytochrome P450 system . The extent methadone level decrease induction cytochrome P450 isoenzymes correlate clinically severity symptom withdrawal . Similar study buprenorphine yet available . Interactions buprenorphine antiretroviral agent may complicate management HIV disease medication coadministered . In small sample study , increase buprenorphine dose require co-administered Sustiva . However , one study liver microsome , ritonavir inhibit metabolism buprenorphine CYP 3A4 , clinical significance inhibition could demonstrate . It well know vitro vivo study fully correlate one another empiric pharmacologic interaction study human subject necessary . The treatment opiate addiction complicate labor intensive practice . This study require use Kaletra alone HIV negative opiate dependent patient . This critical ascertain reality objective data ( level buprenorphine lopinavir ) , well valid subjective symptom opiate withdrawal ( symptoms addict previously experience readily communicate ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Chronic BUP user enrol BUP program , receive BUP least 3 month stable BUP dose least 3 week . Acceptable medical history , physical examination , 12 lead electrocardiogram , clinical laboratory evaluation consistent BUP maintenance Subjects meet criterion opiate dependence , enrol longterm BUP maintenance therapy , stable dose BUP least 3 week . Body weight &gt; 60 kg male &gt; 40 kg female Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 18 30 kg/m2 , inclusive . BMI = weight ( kg ) / [ height ( ) ] 2 . Male female , age 18 65 year . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must nursing , pregnant adequate nonhormonal contraception avoid pregnancy . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 24 hour prior start Study Day 1 . Sex Reproductive Status Exceptions WOCBP unwilling unable use acceptable method avoid pregnancy entire study period 4 week study . WOCBP use prohibit contraceptive method ( oral , injectable , implantable hormonal agent ) Women pregnant breastfeed Women positive pregnancy test enrollment prior study drug administration . Medical History Concurrent Diseases History current evidence significant acute chronic medical illness , within investigator 's discretion , would interfere conduct interpretation study . History nephrolithiasis History acute chronic pancreatitis . History uncontrolled chronic medical illness could adversely affect subject 's adherence study protocol affect patient safety opinion investigator Use medication think significantly alter metabolism Kaletra , Buprenorphine naloxone . History hemolytic disorder ( include druginduced hemolysis ) . Proven suspect acute hepatitis time study entry . Current recent ( within 3 month ) gastrointestinal disease would interfere conduct interpretation study . Any major surgery within 4 week enrollment . Minor surgical procedure require local anesthesia exception . Any gastrointestinal surgery could impact upon absorption study drug . Donation blood plasma blood bank clinical study ( except screen visit ) within 4 week enrollment . Blood transfusion within 4 week enrollment . Inability tolerate oral medication . Inability tolerate venipuncture and/or absence secure venous access . Inability refrain smoke inpatient period Known suspect HIV infection ( subject find positive upon screen HIV exclude ) . Known active drug alcohol abuse , opinion investigator make study participation completion unlikely . Any sound medical , psychiatric and/or social reason determine Investigator . Physical Laboratory Test Findings Evidence organ dysfunction clinically relevant deviation norm observe buprenorphine treat population physical examination , vital sign , ECG clinical laboratory determination . Ingestion alcohol within 24 hour prior dose study medication Positive breathalyzer alcohol test , positive urine screen barbiturate , benzodiazepine , amphetamine opiate buprenorphine . Positive blood screen HIV antibody . QTc interval &gt; 450 msec male &gt; 470 msec female . Second thirddegree AV block . Creatinine clearance ( estimate method Cockcroft Gault ) less 80 mL/min .
