	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 , randomize , double-blind , dose escalation , safety pharmacokinetic study . The study conduct approximately 8-10 center United States Switzerland . Up 32 patient undergone major cardiovascular surgery participate . Patients receive single IV injection I5NP placebo follow cardiovascular surgery . I5NP administer 4 hour ( +/- 30 minute ) follow removal cardiopulmonary bypass machine ( CBM ) . The duration study approximately 44 day , inclusive 14 day screen period . Patients contact phone 6 12 month follow-up question . Patient visit screen , day surgery , hospital in-patient Days 1 , 2 , 3 Day 7 hospital discharge . Safety follow-up continue 30 day post-surgery . 2 phone call make 6 12 month date surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The drug ( I5NP ) small interfere RNA develop protect patient acute kidney injury cardiac bypass surgery . This first-in-man study test safety I5NP measure long drug stay blood stream injection . This study mean test I5NP protect kidney damage may occur rare case surgery . Another purpose dose escalation study find right dose experimental drug give study subject future study . Even though harmful effect see animal test , know side effect experimental drug might cause human .</detailed_description>
