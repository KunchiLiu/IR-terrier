	<brief_title>Regulation B-Cell Function &amp; Glucose Tolerance Older People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There high prevalence type 2 diabetes impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ) old population . Aging associated insulin resistance impaired insulin secretion , great defect old people IGT . Beta-cell dysfunction critical progression normal glucose tolerance IGT diabetes . In Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) , lifestyle intervention diet exercise training significantly lower rate progression IGT diabetes , particularly effective old people . The mechanisms lifestyle change prevent diabetes effect beta-cell function remain unclear . Exercise well-known increase insulin sensitivity , although exercise effect beta-cell function specifically assess . In pilot study support local VA fund , one week aerobic exercise training improve insulin sensitivity expect , also improve beta-cell function sedentary old people IGT , change body weight/composition , fast glucose lipid/inflammatory parameter . Based current VA RCDA project pilot study result , VA CDA-2 proposal test detail novel overall hypothesis lifestyle intervention aerobic exercise training lead improve beta-cell function human age-related glucose intolerance . The potential mechanism age-associated decline beta-cell function whereby exercise training may improve beta-cell function also explore . Beta-cell function examine relation expect improvement insulin sensitivity , effect exercise isolate weight maintenance nutritional balance . The time course exercise effect three month , acute chronic effect exercise train beta-cell function , effect high vs. low intensity exercise training , different important component beta-cell function examine . The interaction exercise training effect beta-cell function old people IGT potential mediator include free fatty acid ( FFA ) /FFA composition , intraabdominal fat , adipocytokines , incretin hormone examine . In light strike effectiveness DPP lifestyle intervention prevent diabetes old people IGT , decline beta-cell function even normal human aging , importance beta-cell dysfunction progression diabetes , great interest define potential , novel metabolic effect exercise train beta-cell function , particularly age population . This project may provide initial step determine mechanism whereby lifestyle change prevent diabetes . This would provide critical information need translate research finding clinical practice order prevent diabetes age veteran population .</detailed_description>
