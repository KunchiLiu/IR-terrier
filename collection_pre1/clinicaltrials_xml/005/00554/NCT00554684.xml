	<brief_title>Treatment Intensity/Factors Predicting Short Long Term Outcomes Elderly Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elderly patient make 26 % 51 % patient admitted ICUs . The proportion individual North America age &gt; 65 project increase 20 % population 2026 . As population demographic change , new technology , pharmaceutical , intervention prolong life , proportion elderly patient admit ICUs survive ICU stay continue increase . Studies examine ICU hospital survival outcome variable result . Few study demonstrate elderly ICU patient experience high mortality rate , others demonstrate age alone , adjusted factor , important prognostic indicator among elderly patient admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) . However , age still use important criterion admission ICUs . Most study review looked patient sixty-five ninety year old . To knowledge two study date address issue among patient older 90 ICU , retrospective . With increase age parallel increase health care cost . The use expensive technology procedure elderly fast become major concern . Data resource allocation treatment intensity ( 90+ ) subgroup sparse . Beyond mortality cost , health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) fundamentally important end point medical care . Few study address outcomes term HRQOL functional status elderly follow discharge critical care unit . These study limit small number subject enrol , retrospective design , lack validate tool ass HRQOL . We plan prospectively collect data look determinant treatment intensity , outcome , resource allocation elderly patient age 65 admitted ICU care take include many patient age interval 90 year age . We also assess HRQOL functional status elderly patient survive admission discharge hospital .</detailed_description>
