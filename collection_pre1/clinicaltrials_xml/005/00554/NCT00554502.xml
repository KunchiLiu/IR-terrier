	<brief_title>Supportive Versus Immunosuppressive Therapy Treatment Of Progressive IgA Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The best treatment glomerular disease kidney currently well define . This study aim answer patient IgA nephropathy , common type glomerulonephritis immunosuppressive treatment ( use steroid chemotherapy ) add supportive treatment effective supportive treatment alone ( use drug lower blood pressure urinary protein loss ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female patient 1870 year histologically proven primary IgAN typical mesangioproliferative feature . Diagnosis make neuropathologist . Proteinuria 0.75 g/day within 12 week prior first visit runin phase ( month 6 ) presence least one risk factor development end stage renal disease 1. arterial hypertension , define ambulatory blood pressure &gt; 140/90 mm Hg use antihypertensive medication 2. impaired renal function , define creatinine clearance estimate GFR &lt; 90 ml/min . Known allergy intolerance study medication ( except case ACEinhibitor , case change angiotensin receptor blocker possible ) . Women pregnant breastfeed woman without sufficient contraception . Any prior immunosuppressive therapy . Variants primary IgAN ( e.g . rapidly progressive IgAN crescent &gt; 50 % glomeruli minimal change GN glomerular IgA deposit ) . Significant liver dysfunction ( three fold increase GPT compare norm ) Contraindication immunosuppressive therapy , like acute chronic infectious disease incl . hepatitis HIV positive patient malignancy leukocytopenia , thrombocytopenia know allergy prednisolone , cyclophosphamide azathioprine active intestinal bleeding , active gastric duodenal ulcer Need permanent immunosuppression , ( e.g . transplanted patient , steroiddependent inflammatory disease ) Secondary IgAN diseases associated glomerular deposit IgA . Additional chronic renal disease . Creatinine clearance 30 ml/min ( mean 3 measurement ) . Alcohol drug abuse Mental condition render subject unable understand nature , scope , possible consequence study Subject unlikely comply protocol , e.g. , uncooperative attitude , inability return followup visit , unlikelihood complete study Participation parallel clinical trial participation another clinical trial within last 3 month . Subjects state dependency sponsor investigator . Employees sponsor investigator . Subjects committed institution legal regulatory order .</criteria>
