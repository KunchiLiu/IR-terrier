	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel prednisolone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Zoledronic acid may help relieve symptom cause bone metastasis . Radioactive substance , strontium chloride Sr 89 , may help relieve bone pain cause prostate cancer . Giving docetaxel together prednisolone without zoledronic acid and/or strontium chloride Sr 89 may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study side effect well give docetaxel together prednisolone work without zoledronic acid and/or strontium chloride Sr 89 treat patient prostate cancer metastatic bone respond hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Prednisolone With Without Zoledronic Acid and/or Strontium Chloride Sr 89 Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer Metastatic Bone That Has Not Responded Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess toxicity tolerability docetaxel zoledronic acid . - To assess toxicity tolerability docetaxel strontium chloride Sr 89 . - To assess toxicity tolerability docetaxel zoledronic acid strontium chloride Sr 89 . Secondary - Compare health economic endpoint treatment group . - Compare change bone mineral density treatment group . - Compare biological profiling prognostic predictive indicator treatment group . Tertiary - Compare median time disease progression treatment group . - Compare pain progression-free survival ( PFS ) treatment group . - Compare PSA PFS treatment group . - Compare pain response treatment group . - Compare overall survival treatment group . - Compare quality life treatment group . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord treatment center ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 v 2 ) . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive docetaxel IV day 1 oral prednisolone daily . - Arm II : Patients receive docetaxel prednisolone arm I zoledronic acid IV 15 minute day 1 . - Arm III : Patients receive docetaxel prednisolone arm I single dose strontium chloride Sr 89 IV day 7 course 2 . - Arm IV : Patients receive docetaxel prednisolone arm I , zoledronic acid arm II , strontium chloride Sr 89 arm III . Treatment docetaxel , prednisolone , zoledronic acid repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Strontium chloride Sr 89 give one time single dose . Quality life assess use Euroqual ( EQ-5D ) FACT-P baseline every 3 month follow . After completion study , patient follow every 3 month .
