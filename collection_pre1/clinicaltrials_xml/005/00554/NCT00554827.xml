	<brief_summary>This study conduct identify much often pralatrexate , give vitamin B12 folic acid , give safely patient cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) relapse ( return respond previous treatment ) refractory ( respond previous treatment ) . It also conduct get information whether pralatrexate effective treating relapse refractory CTCL .</brief_summary>
