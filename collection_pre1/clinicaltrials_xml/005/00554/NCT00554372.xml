	<brief_title>A Study Recombinant Vaccinia Virus Treat Unresectable Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) estimate third common cause cancer-related death world-wide , fifth common cancer diagnosis . According National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , approximately 17,000 new case HCC diagnose annually U.S . In Canada , predict incidence 2007 1,350 new case . In addition , approximately 10,000 new case diagnose per year S. Korea , 35,000 E.U . 45,000 Japan . The five-year survival rate estimate &lt; 10 % HCC patient . Given poor prognosis patient desperate need new therapy . Surgical resection liver transplant curative treatment HCC . Small HCC tumor ( ) ( le 3 cm diameter ) resect hepatectomy , effective treatment . Surgery associate report 50-60 % five-year survival rate , unfortunately possible 10-15 % case . Liver transplant consider patient tumor unresectable still limit exclusively liver , extracapsular vascular invasion within liver , medical contraindication transplantation . Patients unresectable HCC receive liver transplantation , require systemic therapy , may administer percutaneous ethanol injection therapy ( PEIT ) , radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) , transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) , and/or radioembolization , depend size intrahepatic tumor underlie liver function . HCC may good target IT injection JX-594 relatively high rate accessible tumor injection , positive response see patient HCC recently complete Phase I study JX-594 intratumoral injection within liver , excellent tumor response multiple preclinical cancer model , lack effective , tolerable therapy patient HCC receive curative surgery immediate liver transplantation . Furthermore , speculate JX-594 replication target EGFR pathway , 's spread within tumor dependent upon intratumoral vasculature ; HCC highly activate angiogenesis EGFR pathways majority case .</detailed_description>

Pregnant nursing infant Known infection HIV Clinically significant active infection uncontrolled medical condition consider high risk investigational new drug treatment Significant immunodeficiency due underlie illness ( e.g . hematological malignancy , congenital immunodeficiency and/or HIV infection/AIDS ) and/or medication ( e.g . highdose systemic corticosteroid ) History exfoliative skin condition ( e.g . severe eczema , ectopic dermatitis , similar skin disorder ) stage require systemic therapy Clinically significant and/or rapidly accumulate ascites , pericardial and/or pleural effusion Liver tumor location would potentially result significant clinical adverse effect posttreatment tumor swell occur ( e.g . tumor impinge biliary tract could affect drainage ) Severe unstable cardiac disease Current , know CNS malignancy Anticancer therapy ( e.g . RFA , TACE , PEIT , radioembolization , chemotherapy , surgery , investigational drug , etc . ) within 4 week prior first treatment Absolute contraindication undergo MRI scan Experienced severe systemic reaction sideeffect result previous smallpox vaccination Use antiplatelet anticoagulation medication Use follow antiviral agent : ribavirin , adefovir , cidofovir ( within 7 day prior first treatment ) , PEGIFN ( within 14 day prior first treatment ) . Inability unwillingness give inform consent comply procedure require protocol Patients household contact meet criterion unless alternate living arrangement make patient 's active dosing period 7 day follow last dose study medication : Pregnant nursing infant Children &lt; 12 month old History exfoliative skin condition stage require systemic therapy Significant immunodeficiency due underlie illness ( e.g .
