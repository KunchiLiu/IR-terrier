	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation With With Transcatheter Arterial Embolization Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Local ablation safe effective therapy patient undergo resection , bridge transplantation . Of various percutaneous local ablative therapy , radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) attract great interest effectiveness safety small HCC ≤ 5.0cm , 3-year survival rate 62 % 68 % , low treatment morbidity 0 % 12 % , low treatment mortality 0 % 1 % . Prospective randomize trial show RFA well percutaneous ethanol injection ( PEI ) produce high rate complete tumor necrosis few number treatment session well survival . Unfortunately , complete tumor necrosis rate tumor large 5cm less favorable , local recurrence rate high 20 % even small HCC le 3.5cm . The high local recurrence rate may due residual cancer cell kill RFA adjacent microscopic satellite tumor nodule . Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization ( TACE ) prove effective palliative therapy unresectable HCC . And study show combined TACE RFA may produce superior tumor control RFA alone reduce local recurrence rate . In study Yamakado et al. , 64 patient 92 tumor underwent RFA within two week TACE . The intrahepatic recurrence rate 15 % 1 year 43 % 2years , 1 , 2 , year overall survival 100 % 93 % , respectively . These result appear favorable , prospective randomize control study compare RFA combine TACE versus RFA alone . Thus purpose study prospectively evaluate whether combine RFA TACE ( RFA-TACE ) result well survival outcome RFA alone patient HCC .</detailed_description>
