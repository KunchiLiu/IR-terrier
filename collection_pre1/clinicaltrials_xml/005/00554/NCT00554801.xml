	<detailed_description>The incidence nature central auditory dysfunction combat soldier expose high-explosive blast determine . Using battery behavioral neurophysiological auditory test , propose evaluate central auditory function soldier recently expose explosive blast deploy Iraq Afghanistan . In collaboration Army Audiology &amp; Speech Center Walter Reed Army Medical Center ( WRAMC ) , research coordinate National Center Rehabilitative Auditory Research ( NCRAR ) Portland VA Medical Center , data collection take place NCRAR WRAMC . The study objective determine specific central auditory processing disorder often associate exposure high-explosive blast , disorder spontaneously recover remain time . One hundred patient suffer blast exposure , either brain damage mild traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , recruit WRAMC participate research study . A battery central auditory processing test administer participant soon possible arrival WRAMC . Patients demonstrate aspect central auditory processing disorder invite participate test nine twelve month later . Those subject bring NCRAR Portland VA Medical Center return WRAMC two day auditory testing , undergo battery test administer initially . Control subject history blast exposure match age , gender , audiometric configuration experimental subject also test NCRAR site . Data extract interview medical record , include detail blast exposure , score overall test brain function administer WRAMC TBI team , presence absence post traumatic stress disorder , well self-report questionnaire regard quality life , presence tinnitus and/or balance problem , use interpretation result .</detailed_description>
