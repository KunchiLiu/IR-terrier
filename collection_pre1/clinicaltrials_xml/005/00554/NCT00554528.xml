	<brief_title>Arthroplasty Versus Fusion Anterior Cervical Surgery : Prospective Study Impact Adjacent Level</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anterior surgery cervical spine one practice procedure spine surgery . Its immediate accuracy safety prove since long time case degenerative disk disease disk herniation . But segmental arthrodesis lead overload adjacent disk . A lot study show increase mobility pressure adjacent segment responsible new degeneration clinical symptom . Recently , cervical disk prosthesis develop maintain mobility level surgery . This technique suppose decrease risk adjacent disk disease , time , analysis result difficult , due lack randomized study long term follow . The aim prospective randomize study evaluate aftermath arthroplasty compare fusion adjacent disk degeneration . The main objective show radiological difference 3 year term adjacent disk degeneration . The secondary objective : - evaluate rate new clinical symptom three year - show difference postoperative period , especially concern length hospital stay , use pain killer return work . - verify maintain mobility pf prosthesis three year . This control study two group equal size : one group treat discectomy arthrodesis discectomy prosthesis/ The criterion inclusion patient : clinical radiculopathy and/or myelopathy due cervical disk disease ( disk herniation osteophytosis ) , lack effect medical treatment , CT scan MRI show compression root and/or spinal cord . The main exclusion criterion : plurisegmental disk disease , injury happen professional activity , previous cervical surgery . During study , perform clinical ( standardized scale : Neck Disability Index , Short Form 36 , neurological exam ) radiological ( height adjacent disk , ostheophytis , â€¦ ) follow-up . The analysis current literature statistical process lead total amount 220 patient enrol study . This multicentric study organize total duration five year ( two year inclusion three year follow-up ) .</detailed_description>
