	<brief_title>Rectal Cancer Surgery Without Mechanical Bowel Preparation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preoperative mechanical bowel preparation ( MBP ) ( i.e . include oral laxative , retrograde enemas and/or oral diet surgery ) standard practice colorectal surgery . The importance MBP prevent anastomotic leakage infectious morbidity elective colorectal surgery dogma among surgeon many year . The main reason belief postoperative complication relate septic bowel content . However , paucity scientific evidence demonstrate efficacy practice reduce morbidity . Moreover , potential disadvantage MBP include requirement longer preoperative duration admission surgery , time consume nature , expensive unpleasant patient expose early population particular risk fluid electrolyte imbalance .At least eight randomized clinical trial two meta-analyses fail show superiority MBP colorectal surgery . On contrary , demonstrated preparation might lead increased rate septic complication . Such initial date lead surgeon re-evaluate current clinical practice colonic surgery . But date , finding finally apply rectal surgery insufficient date . To date , study MBP specifically devote rectal surgery . Moreover , currently admit risk septic complication follow rectal resection , result well-known risk factor , high colonic preparation . It reason colorectal surgeon consider preparation regimen rectal cancer surgery could represent additive risk factor postoperative morbidity .</detailed_description>
