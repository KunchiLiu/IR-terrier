	<criteria>Males female age great equal 18 less equal age 75 . Patients indication undergo mitral valve repair consistent ACC/AHA recommendation ; include great equal 2+ regurgitation preoperative TEE TTE assessment . Candidate cardiopulmonary bypass . A Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction great equal 40 % . Able willing comply study requirement , include require study followup visit . Able willing five consent follow study instruction . Female patient childbearing potential ( surgically sterilize one year postmenopausal ) , negative pregnancy test ( serum betahCG ) within 24 hour prior mitral valve surgery . Any previous cardiac surgery . Any interventional cardiology procedure within six month prior study include patient drug elute stent ( DES ) implant within 6 month . Evidence acute Myocardial Infarction ( MI ) within 7 day intend treatment investigational device . Prior mitral valve surgery valvuloplasty currently implant prosthetic valve . Restricted mobility mitral apparatus result valvular area le 3.0 cm2 . Recent evolve bacterial endocarditis patient current antibiotic therapy . Patients ICD 's . Any angiographic clinical evidence investigator feel would place patient increase risk placement device concurrent medical condition life expectancy le 12 month . Patients immunocompromised autoimmune disease . Patients suffer renal insufficiency ( Creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL ) patient chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis . Comorbid condition place subject unacceptable surgical risk ( e.g . sever chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , hepatic failure , immunosuppressive abnormality , haematological abnormality ) . Significant mitral annular calcification . Use Coumadin , IIbIIIa inhibitor , Clopidigrel ( Plavix ) anticoagulant within ( 5 ) five day prior surgery . Participation study involve investigational drug device within past month , ongoing participation study investigational device . Intolerance hypersensitivity anaesthetic . Patients transesophageal echo/Doppler contraindicate . History bleed diathesis coagulopathy . History stroke within prior 6 month Subjects undergo concomitant cardiac repair replacement CABG ( less equal 3 vessel ) mitral annuloplasty , tricuspid valve repair ablation therapy correction atrial fibrillation . Excluded concomitant procedure : aortic valve replacement , LV remodeling , surgery congenital repair . Patients Euroscore &gt; 10 .</criteria>
