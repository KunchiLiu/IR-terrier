	<brief_summary>High-dose interleukin 2 ( Proleukin , Novartis ) ( IL-2 ) approve U.S Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment metastatic kidney cancer standard treatment disease . At present time , IL-2 therapy kidney cancer produce remission disease last treatment complete . However , patient receive IL-2 benefit patient experience potentially dangerous side effect . Recent research suggest certain patient may respond good IL-2 others . The Cytokine Working Group currently conduct clinical trial aim identify confirm research narrow application IL-2 patient likely benefit . This trial conduct 14 treatment center Untied States specialize give IL-2 . All patient eligible enrollment study receive FDA approve regimen high-dose IL-2 . To identify marker may predict response IL-2 , patient ask provide piece original tumor research . They require separate tumor biopsy . Blood sample ( 2-3 tablespoon ) research also draw prior treatment tumor measurement obtain treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm renal cell carcinoma metastatic unresectable . If patient measurable disease restrict solitary lesion , neoplastic nature confirm cytology/histology . Patients must provide access tissue block contain adequate tumor interpretation analysis . Patients must measurable disease . Patients must good performance status ( ECOG 0 1 ; Karnofsky PS 10080 % ) . Patients must adequate organ function . Patients must contraindication vasopressor agent . Patients must â‰¥ 18 year age . Patients receive systemic therapy metastatic disease . Patients organ allograft . Patients require likely require systemic corticosteroid therapy intercurrent illness . Patients significant medical disease malignancy ( e.g . COPD , patient ascites pleural effusion ) , opinion investigator would significantly increase risk immunotherapy .
