	<brief_summary>This phase III trial study side effect well give combination chemotherapy together autologous stem cell transplant and/or radiation therapy work treat young patient extraocular retinoblastoma . Giving chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplant stop growth tumor cell stop divide kill . After treatment , stem cell collect patient 's blood and/or bone marrow store . More chemotherapy give prepare bone marrow stem cell transplant . The stem cell return patient replace blood-forming cell destroy chemotherapy . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving radiation therapy combination chemotherapy and/or autologous stem cell transplant may kill remain tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy , Autologous Stem Cell Transplant , and/or Radiation Therapy Treating Young Patients With Extraocular Retinoblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate proportion 3 group patient extraocular retinoblastoma ( stage 2 3 : regional extra-ocular disease ; , stage 4a : disseminate metastatic disease involve central nervous system [ CNS ] ; stage 4b : patient CNS disease ) achieve long-term event-free survival treatment aggressive multimodality therapy compare historical control . II . To estimate response rate induction phase regimen . III . To evaluate toxicity associate regimen . OUTLINE : INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive vincristine intravenously ( IV ) day 0 , 7 , 14 , cisplatin IV 6 hour day 0 , cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour etoposide IV 1 hour day 1 2 , filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) begin day 3 continue blood count recover . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion induction chemotherapy , patient stage 2 3 disease least partial response proceed radiotherapy . Patients stage 4a 4b disease least partial response proceed high-dose consolidation chemotherapy autologous stem cell infusion . STEM CELL HARVESTING ( stage 4a 4b disease ) : Peripheral blood stem cell ( prefer ) bone marrow cell collect least 1 course induction chemotherapy . HIGH-DOSE CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY ( stage 4a 4b disease ) : Patients receive carboplatin IV 4 hour day -8 -6 thiotepa IV 3 hour etoposide IV 3 hour day -5 -3 . AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL INFUSION ( stage 4a 4b disease ) : Patients undergo autologous stem cell infusion day 0 . Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) begin day 1 continue blood count recover . RADIOTHERAPY : Patients stage 2 3 disease ( orbital and/or regional involvement ) undergo radiotherapy sit initially involved begin within 42 day start course 4 induction chemotherapy . Patients stage 4a 4b disease undergo radiotherapy sit initially involve base response begin approximately 42 day autologous stem cell infusion . Patients stage 4a disease achieve complete response induction chemotherapy le 5 mm residual tumor time plan irradiation , patient stage 4b disease achieve complete response induction chemotherapy undergo radiotherapy . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 1 year annually thereafter 9 year .</detailed_description>
