	<brief_title>Bacterial Interference Prevention Catheter-Associated UTI : Geriatric Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Preparation study catheter : Urinary catheter incubate broth E. coli 83972 48 hour prior insertion patient . Samples broth remove 24 hour 48 hour incubation test purity E. coli 83972 . Study catheter insert 48 hour incubation , unless contamination see 24-hour plate . The 48-hour plate read 72 hour , contamination would prompt removal study catheter . For subject require antibiotic clear bladder prior catheter insertion , use derivative strain E. coli 83972 appropriate antibiotic resistance . 2 . Screening procedure : Eligible subject identify chart review discussion health care provider . Research personnel also periodically assess inpatient geriatric bed review upcoming appointment geriatric urology clinic MEDVAMC . Potential outpatient subject may contact telephone clinic appointment advise study . Those wish participate meet study personnel person come clinic appointment . At time enrollment , principal investigator research coordinator explain study protocol detail , subject give chance ask question . Informed consent obtain interested person time . Any necessary screening procedure ( history physical examination , renal ultrasound , serum creatinine , baseline urine culture ) perform obtain informed consent . Subjects renal ultrasound within past 12 month , serum creatinine measure within past 6 month , undergo procedure . Also , study personnel collect urine culture determine organism present subject 's bladder baseline . The subject may receive 7-10 day appropriate antibiotic clear bladder insertion study catheter , depend pre-existing bladder flora . 3 . Insertion study catheter : Subjects require fluoroquinolone antibiotic clear bladder receive study catheter 4-5 day complete treatment . Subjects require class antibiotic receive study catheter 2-3 day complete antibiotic treatment . The study catheter insert research personnel unit nurse . Insertion perform use sterile technique . Urine collect newly insert study catheter culture study personnel . 4 . Urine sample collection : Urine sample collect study catheter day 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 catheter insertion . Urine mail PI 's laboratory MEDVAMC biological sample collection container via overnight mail outpatient , sample collect directly inpatient . 5 . Study catheter removal : A day 28 urine sample collect study catheter immediately prior removal . Study catheter remove study personnel MEDVAMC . Subjects still E. coli 83972 day catheter removal give option take antibiotic eradicate E. coli 83972 bladder remain colonized follow-up phase study . 6 . Specimen mail procedure : We utilize specimen mail supply . The study organism , E. coli 83972 , 83 % survival 72 hour specimen mailer tube , mail location Texas Louisiana . Both study organism uropathogens likewise recover urinary catheter remove 72 hour previously send u specimen mail tube . 7 . Microbiologic study : Semi-quantitative culture perform urine sample determine whether E. coli 83972 present relative concentration specie urine . The presence urine bacteria E. coli examine use standard bacteriological method . E. coli strain assess use standard microbiological technique well molecular technique research laboratory . Urine spread MacConkey lactose agar plate incubate allow bacterial growth . Representative E. coli colony subject restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) analysis use pulse field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) definitively identify E. coli 83972 . The removed urinary catheter sonicated extract surface-associated organism . An aliquot sonicate plat identification organism . 8 . Defining outcome : We assess safety colonization success . For purpose study , define successful bladder colonization persistence E. coli 83972 urine &gt; 28 day insertion catheter . Shorter duration colonization define failure colonize bladder . We also compare incidence symptomatic UTI colonize E. coli 83972 incidence symptomatic UTI experience subject year prior study entry . 9 . Safety assessment : The principal investigator contact subject daily first 3 day wear study catheter , weekly remainder first 28 day insertion study catheter , monthly thereafter long remain colonized E. coli 83972 . Subjects instruct contact study personnel sign symptom UTI , catheter malfunction , need antibiotic . 10 . UTI elderly subject present constitutional symptom rather localize urinary tract , fever response blunt elderly . Symptomatic UTI define presence significant bacteriuria ( &gt; 102 cfu/ml ) , pyuria ( &gt; 10 WBC/hpf ) plus &gt; 1 follow sign symptom : fever ( &gt; 100.0 F ) , suprapubic flank discomfort , bladder spasm , malaise , alter functional status , alter mental status , provide etiology clinical manifestation identify . Subjects ' baseline incidence UTI year prior enrollment determine chart review . Any document treatment UTI regard symptomatic UTI . We also inquire whether patient treat UTI outside facility . Subjects develop symptomatic UTI treat antibiotic guide susceptibility pattern organism ( ) grow urine culture . 11 . Duration participation : If subject remain colonize E. coli 83972 day 28 removal study catheter , subject decline antibiotic eradicate study organism , continue collect monthly urine specimens organism lose bladder completion 12 month , whichever come first . Thus , individual subject 's participation study limit 12 month less .</detailed_description>
