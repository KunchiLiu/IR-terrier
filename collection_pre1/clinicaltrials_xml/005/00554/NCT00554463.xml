	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin etoposide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Colony-stimulating factor , G-CSF pegfilgrastim , may increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood may help immune system recover side effect chemotherapy radiation therapy . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study G-CSF pegfilgrastim see well work treat neutropenia patient undergo combination chemotherapy radiation therapy limit stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>G-CSF Pegfilgrastim Treating Neutropenia Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy Chemotherapy Limited Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate safety efficacy filgrastim ( G-CSF ) reduce grade 4 neutropenia grade 3-4 febrile neutropenia patient limited stage small cell lung cancer treat radiotherapy concurrent chemotherapy comprise cisplatin etoposide . Secondary - To evaluate safety efficacy pegfilgrastim reduce grade 4 neutropenia grade 3-4 febrile neutropenia patient treat adjuvant chemotherapy comprise cisplatin etoposide . - To estimate incidence dose modification treatment delay patient treated regimen . - To estimate incidence esophagitis , pneumonitis , non-hematological adverse event patient treat regimen . - To estimate incidence grade 4 thrombocytopenia patient treat regimen . - To estimate median two-year rate progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo thoracic radiotherapy daily day 1-5 week 1-3 twice daily day 1-5 week 4 5 total 16 fraction . Patients also receive concurrent chemotherapy comprise cisplatin IV day 1 etoposide IV day 1-3 . Chemotherapy repeat every 3 week 2 course . Patients receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) day 4-13 25-34 . After completion chemoradiotherapy , patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy comprise cisplatin IV day 1 etoposide IV day 2 3 . Adjuvant therapy repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive pegfilgrastim SC day 4 course adjuvant therapy . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month one year , every 6 month 2-3 year , annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
