	<detailed_description>The Study Drug PBI-05204 , make oleander plant , design prevent growth cancer cell affect protein lead cell death . Screening Tests Before begin receive study drug , `` screening test '' help doctor decide eligible take part study . The following test perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) , height , weight . - You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status evaluation ) . - Your complete medical history record . - You electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) . - You may echocardiogram ( picture heart use sound wave ) , applicable . - You compute tomography ( CT ) scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) check status disease . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - Women able child must negative blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . Study Drug Dose Level : If find eligible take part study , amount PBI-05204 take base many participant enrol , safety information available . There may 6 participant enrol group . The first group participant enrol study receive PBI-05204 low dose level . If intolerable side effect experience , next group participant take high dose level . This process continue researcher find high dose PBI-05204 give without intolerable side effect occur . Study Drug Administration : Depending group enrol , take PBI-05204 capsule mouth every day time twice day ( every 12 hour ) . Your Doctor tell schedule . You take drug Days 1-21 . On Days 22-28 take study drug . Each 28 day call `` study cycle '' . Study Visits : At Predose Visit , 1-7 day Day 1 Cycle 1 follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , height , weight . - You performance status evaluation . - Urine collect routine test . - You ECG , applicable - You heart rate monitor Holter monitor . A Holter monitor machine continuously record heart 's rhythm . Electrodes ( small conducting patch ) stick onto chest attach small record monitor . You carry Holter monitor pocket small pouch wear around neck waist . The monitor battery operate . After 24 hour , return monitor study doctor . The study doctor look record see irregular heart rhythm . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) collect routine test . - Women able child blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . On Day 1 Cycle 1 follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You performance status evaluation . - You ECG . The ECG repeat Day 1 every late Cycle . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You take dose PBI-05204 mouth . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) collect PK test take first daily dose study drug 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 hour later . - Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) collect pharmacodynamic ( PD ) test take study drug . PD test use look level study drug body may affect disease . On Day 2 Cycle 1 follow : - You take dose PBI-05204 mouth - You ECG . On Day 7 Cycle 1 follow : - Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) draw PD test . - You take dose PBI-05204 mouth . - You heart rate monitor Holter monitor . On Day 8 Cycle 1 follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You take dose PBI-05204 mouth . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) collect PK test take first daily dose study drug 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 hour later . Additional blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) also collect PK test take second daily dose study drug 1 , 2 , 4 , 12 hour later . - You ECG . On Day 15 Cycle 1 follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You performance status evaluation . - You ECG . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You take dose PBI-05204 mouth . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) collect PK test take first daily dose study drug 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 hour later . On Day 21 Cycle 1 follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You take dose PBI-05204 mouth . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) collect PK test take first daily dose study drug 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 hour later . Additional blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) also collect PK test take second daily dose study drug 1 , 2 , 4 , 12 hour later . - Blood ( 6 teaspoon ) collect PD test . During last week Cycle 2 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign , height weight . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You CT MRI scan check status disease . - Women able child blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . On Day 1 Cycles 3 beyond physical exam , include measurement vital sign . At end every 2 cycle begin Cycle 4 ( Cycles 4 , 6 , 8 , ) blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . You CT MRI . If enrolled expansion group , blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) collect PK test take daily dose study drug 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 24 hour later Day 1 Cycle 1 . On Days 8 , 15 21 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) also collect PK test take daily dose study drug 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 8 hour later . If enrolled expansion group , also two mandatory tumor biopsy collect within 1- 7 day take daily dose study drug Days 15-21 Cycle 1 . To collect biopsy , doctor insert needle tumor withdraw small piece tumor . The tumor tissue study look special `` marker '' tumor may help researcher predict may benefit study drug . Length Study : You remain study disease get bad , decide come study , doctor decides best interest come study , intolerable side effect , sponsor close study . If decide leave study early must tell study doctor write return unused study drug . You must complete end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : Once off-study , end-of-study visit within 30 day last dose PBI-05204 . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You performance status evaluation . - You ECG . - You heart rate monitor Holter monitor . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test - You CT/MRI scan ass tumor . - Women able child must blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . Long-Term Follow-up : After complete end-of-study visit , study doctor continue contact family doctor minimum 30 day . You may contact phone call ( le 5 minute ) , ask general health . This investigational study . PBI-05204 FDA approve commercially available . At time , PBI-05204 use research . Up 52 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
