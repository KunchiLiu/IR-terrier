	<brief_title>Lactobacillus Acidophilus L92 Markers Allergic Inflammation Nasal Provocation With Grass Pollen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objective study establish benefit bacterial product , Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-92 ( CALPIS U.S.A. , Inc. , Torrance , CA ) , patient allergic rhinitis . This do noting : - The threshold dose pollen extract require nasal challenge need elicit nasal obstruction measure acoustic rhinometry pre-treatment , compare nasal response dose end treatment . - The dose pollen extract need ( progressive dose escalation ) elicit nasal obstruction end treatment significant nasal obstruction reach pre-treatment dose . - Changes cytokine chemokine profile obtain analysis nasal secretion specimens pre- post-treatment . - Changes cytokine profile culture peripheral blood mononuclear cell stimulate PHA pre- post-treatment . - PHADIA ImmunoCAP perennial ryegrass pollen titer pre- post-treatment . - The threshold concentration standardize perennial ryegrass extract elicit positive skin prick test pre- post-treatment - Total serum IgE pre- post- The active product use tablet make desiccated Lactobacillus acidophilus strain L-92 filler . These bacteria present GI tract healthy human . They non-pathogenic , use food industry preparation ferment food century . They low pH environment convert sugar lactic acid , inhibit growth pathogen . Lactobacilli first genus bacteria suspect health benefit . Most Probiotic study do live culture , indeed animal model literature support great beneficial immunomodulatory effect live bacteria kill organism . However , beneficial effect Lactobacilli propose due uptake processing cell wall component bacterial DNA , thus interaction live bacteria may require beneficial effect . However , tablet form deliver live bacteria , term ease consumption consumer , would prefer many people , well allow easy blind supplement clinical trial . The study propose herein first large study product use live , desiccated tablet preparation bacteria . If product beneficial effect , fact tablet form greatly benefit consistency manufacturing , well ease storage ultimate use product consumer . CALPIS select strain lactobacillus , L. acidophilus ( L92 ) , basis IgE- lower effect experimental study mice . This product , liquid ferment milk form , test follow clinical study : 1 . Cedar pollen allergy study ( 2003 ) . Significant improvement symptom-medication score detect ( ISHIDA et al BIOSCI . BIOTECH . BIOCHEM . 1652-60 , 2005 ) . Product : Liquid fermentation L acidophilus L-92 milk , heat-treated 75°C 10 minute 100 mL volume . 2 . Perennial allergic rhinitis ( 2002/03 ) . Significant improvement symptom-medication score observe ( ISHIDA et al J . Dairy Sci . 528-33 , 2005 ) . Product : 100 mL heat-treated milk ferment L acidophilus L-92 ( 3x1010 counts/100 mL ) 3 . Atopic dermatitis ( 2005 ) . Improvement symptom-medication score detect . Unpublished data . Product : 100 mL ferment milk L acidophilus L-92 . An initial study use desiccate form tablet perform : 4 . Artificial pollen allergy study ( 2005 ) . Improvement quality life note . Product : desiccated bacteria filler tablet . 20 mg , 60 mg 180 mg study . 180 mg/day effective . Unpublished data . METHODS PHASE 1 In first phase , subject history grass pollinosis , positive skin test grass , study season randomize placebo active treatment 4 month . Randomization base upon retrospective Rhinitis Quality Life Questionnaire regard recollection bad week last pollen season . The intent randomize subject distribution severe versus mild allergy symptom equal group . The subject evaluate nasal function ( patency acoustic rhinometry ) undergo nasal provocation test collection nasal secretion begin end study . Blood drawn skin test perform begin end study . Primary Objective : To assess efficacy L-92 versus placebo compare change nasal obstruction use acoustic rhinometry baseline , upon nasal provocation dose grass pollen extract find elicit obstruction enrollment . Secondary objective : 1 . To compare change threshold dose nasal specific provocation ( NPT ) test grass pollen require elicit nasal obstruction . 2 . To compare change serum IgE level grass pollen ( perform PHADIA ImmunoCAP ) total IgE . 3 . To compare change cytokine IFN-gamma , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-9 IL-13 , chemokine , eotaxin , nasal secretion fluid use dose pollen elicit nasal obstruction baseline . 4 . To compare change cytokine IFN-gamma , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-9 IL-13 supernatant peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) stimulate PHA pre post-treatment . PHASE 2 In second phase : Subjects give option participate Phase 2 study . In phase , subject continue either placebo active product throughout next pollen season , start January 2008 , fill Rhinitis Quality Life Questionnaires pick study tablet begin April , May June . They ask fill daily medication/symptom diary first two week May ( exact date subject change depend climatic factor ) . The peak grass pollen season April June . Blood drawn last visit late June 2008 specific total IgE ImmunoCAP .</detailed_description>
