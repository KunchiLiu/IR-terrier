	<detailed_description>Disease vein include blood clot , varicose vein , leg swelling , sores leg . Venous disease common overweight patient , little known case . This research project investigate relationship body weight function leg vein use special non-invasive technique know venous plethysmography . We hope investigate reason relationship body weight high risk vein problem . Approximately 45 people take part study . Patients recruit among three group : normal weight people , overweight people , obese people . Resting ankle-brachial index measure low extremity exclude presence peripheral arterial disease . Venous physiologic study use air plethysmography positional maneuver perform . Parameters measure outflow time , passive draining refill time , exercise venous plethysmography . All study perform Phlebotest system ( Osborn Medical ) . All study procedures do one visit , follow-up require .</detailed_description>
