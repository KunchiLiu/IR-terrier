	<brief_title>Pharmacist-led Group Medical Visits Help With Diabetes Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Project Background : Diabetes , hypertension , dyslipidemia chronic disease lead heart attack stroke , require intervention patient organizational level promote sustainable lifestyle medication change cardiac risk reduction costly . Group intervention emerge potentially cost-saving patient-centered approach help achieve necessary lifestyle medication change treatment chronic disease , efficacy absence direct physician participation well demonstrate diabetes . Our preliminary data show pharmacist-based , group diabetes management program Providence VAMC achieve significant improvement glycemic control variable success toward improvement blood pressure lipid control type 2 diabetic patient , education , behavioral intervention aggressive pharmacotherapy 4 weekly group session . However , know long-term sustainability intervention , exportability , cost VA health-related quality-of-life implication patient enrolled program . Project Objectives : To assess whether non-physician-based , group diabetes behavioral pharmacotherapy intervention program 12 month : 1. improve cardiac risk factor , 2. improve health-related quality-of-life , 3. add minimal institutional cost ; compare usual care veteran type 2 diabetes . Project Methods : We propose 3-site randomized-controlled study test efficacy pharmacist-based , group diabetes behavioral pharmacotherapy intervention program ( treatment arm ) 13 month vs. usual care ( control arm ) achieve cardiac risk reduction type 2 diabetic patient Hemoglobin A1c &gt; 7 % least one cardiac risk factor smoking , hyperlipidemia hypertension national guideline recommend goal . The intervention treatment arm consist two phase . Phase 1 ( intensive intervention ) consist weekly group session education nurse , physical therapist , dietician ; behavioral modification medication titration clinical pharmacist target control glycemia , smoking , blood pressure , lipids 4 week . Phase 2 consist quarterly booster session 1 year prevent relapse . Patients control arm continue usual care . Our study endpoint difference 2 group 13 month study enrollment : 1 ) hemoglobin a1c , blood pressure , LDL cholesterol smoke 2 ) health-related quality life ( SF-36V ) score , 3 ) healthcare cost VA perspective . A total 250 patient enrol 3 VAMC site follow 13 month .</detailed_description>
