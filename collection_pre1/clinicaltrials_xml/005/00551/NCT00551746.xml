	<brief_summary>Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) large contributor morbidity mortality Western world associate high-calorie diet , high body mass , variety factor . CHD lead myocardial infarction ( MI ) embolic event . In area France , though , paradox high-cholesterol diet low CHD MI incidence find . This paradox trace consumption red wine . Further research suggest component grape use red wine may source cardio-protective factor result French paradox . These component also present purple grape juice ( PGJ ) . PGJ show variety potential cardio-protective effect , include inhibition platelet aggregation . Since PGJ contain alcohol may provide additional benefit avoid physical social implication alcohol abuse . Since research PGJ vitro , though , study vivo cross-over study short duration 7 14 day , additional research require determine whether long-term consumption PGJ additional sustain benefit , similar long-term use red wine France . The propose study 2 arm randomize , control ( double-blind ) study PGJ calorically-matching placebo drink 100 healthy individual .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study treatment period 90 day ( 13 week , 3 month ) treatment dose 7 mL/kg/day . The treatment dose standard dose previously work research use variety clinical research ( 27 , 32 ) . Study randomization perform double-blind fashion study investigator participant unaware group assignment . Randomization order create use randomize blocked design . After volunteer consent provide , clinical study coordinator open sequentially-numbered envelope contain study group assignment provide 4 week supply study beverage . Participants see follow-up study visit approximately 4 week interval baseline enrollment visit . Compliance study treatment ( PGJ placebo ) assess interview visit 2 , 3 , 4 . At conclusion visit 2 3 , supply study beverage provide participant consumption ensue 4 week . Study beverage supply remain end 90-day study period donate participant . Platelet Aggregation test perform ThromboVision ( Salt Lake City , UT ) use multiple platelet agonist , include ADP , collagen/epinephrine , PMA , TRAP . Each aggregation inducer target separate platelet activation pathway .</detailed_description>
