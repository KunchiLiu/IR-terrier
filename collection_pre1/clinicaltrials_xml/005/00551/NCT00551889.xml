	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Celecoxib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving cyclophosphamide together celecoxib may help kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose celecoxib give together cyclophosphamide treat patient advanced cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide Celecoxib Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To describe toxicity oral cyclophosphamide administer escalate dos celecoxib patient advanced malignancy . - To evaluate effect regimen plasma level vascular endothelial growth factor . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study celecoxib . In first course , patient receive oral cyclophosphamide daily day 1-35 oral celecoxib twice daily day 8-35 . In subsequent course , patient receive oral cyclophosphamide daily oral celecoxib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline , periodically treatment , time tumor progression . Samples analyze vascular endothelial growth factor level store future analysis circulate DNA angiogenic biomarkers . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
