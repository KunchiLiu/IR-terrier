	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , active-controlled , parallel-group , multi-center study vicriviroc maleate treatment-na誰ve subject infect CCR5-tropic HIV . The study compare virologic benefit vicriviroc combine ritonavir-boosted Reyataz control group receive Truvada plus ritonavir-boosted Reyataz . Interim analyse perform first cohort 80 subject complete 24 week 48 week treatment . The second cohort 120 subject enrol first interim analysis ; third interim analysis perform subject second cohort complete 24 week treatment . The primary efficacy analysis conduct 200 subject stage complete 48 week treatment discontinue . The final analysis perform Week 96 , 200 subject complete 96 week treatment discontinue . If vicriviroc show provide benefit study dose , study participant vicriviroc arm complete 96 week treatment may continue protocol extension , offer vicriviroc free charge drug commercially available location sponsor terminate clinical development vicriviroc .</detailed_description>
