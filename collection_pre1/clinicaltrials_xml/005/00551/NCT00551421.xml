	<brief_summary>Monoclonal antibody , pertuzumab cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving pertuzumab together cetuximab may kill tumor cell . This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose pertuzumab give together cetuximab see well work treat patient previously treat locally advanced metastatic colorectal cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pertuzumab Cetuximab Treating Patients With Previously Treated Locally Advanced Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety , tolerability , recommend phase II dose pertuzumab administer combination cetuximab patient cetuximab-refractory locally advanced metastatic colorectal cancer . II . To evaluate objective tumor response rate ( RR ) patient treat regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate median progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient treat regimen . II . To evaluate median overall survival ( OS ) patient treat regimen . III . To evaluate RR , PFS , OS subgroup patient EGFR-positive immunohistochemistry . IV . To explore relationship skin rash efficacy outcomes RR , PFS , OS patient . V. To explore relationship objective tumor response positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan course two efficacy outcome RR , PFS , OS patient . VI . To explore relationship variety laboratory correlate efficacy outcomes RR , PFS , OS patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I dose-escalation study pertuzumab follow phase II study . PHASE I : Patients receive pertuzumab IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Patients also receive cetuximab IV 60-120 minute day 2 , 8 , 15 course 1 day 1 , 8 , 15 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients receive treatment phase I. Pertuzumab administer recommend phase II dose ( determined phase I ) . Previously collect tumor tissue sample analyze correlative study . Samples analyze KRAS mutation via polymerase chain reaction pyrosequencing ; EGFR expression via immunohistochemistry fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) ; HER receptor ligand gene expression ; circulate tumor cell . Additional blood sample collect periodically isolate circulate tumor cell analyze via FISH analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
