	<brief_summary>CRx-102 synergistic combination drug candidate contain cardiovascular drug dipyridamole low dose glucocorticoid prednisolone . CRx-102 believe work novel mechanism action dipyridamole selectively amplify anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory activity glucocorticoid without replicate dose-dependent adverse effect . CRx-102 associated clinical benefit proof concept study subject hand Osteoarthritis ( OA ) Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) . In trial , CRx-102 give subject active RA add-on therapy exist stable dos Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs ( DMARDs ) include methotrexate ( MTX ) , sulfasalazine , hydroxychloroquine , leflunomide azathioprine . MTX combination DMARDs ( e.g. , sulfasalazine hydroxychloroquine ) permit reflect current standard care practice within rheumatology .</brief_summary>
