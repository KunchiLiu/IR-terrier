	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To describe toxicity combination oral etoposide 50 mg daily escalate dos celecoxib patient advanced malignancy . - To evaluate effect combination etoposide celecoxib plasma level vascular endothelial growth factor . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study celecoxib . In course 1 , patient receive oral etoposide daily day 1-35 oral celecoxib twice daily day 8-35 . In subsequent course , patient receive oral etoposide daily oral celecoxib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline , periodically treatment , time tumor progression . Samples analyze vascular endothelial growth factor level enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay store future analysis circulate DNA angiogenic biomarkers polymerase chain reaction assay .</detailed_description>
