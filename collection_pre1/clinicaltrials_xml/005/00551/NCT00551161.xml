	<brief_summary>We study subject mild moderate Alzheimer 's disease stable dose cholinesterase inhibitor [ donepezil ( Aricept ) , rivastigmine ( Exelon ) , galantamine ( Razadyne ) ] least 3 month , previously take memantine ( Namenda ) . This open-label study , magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) primary outcome measure , along neuropsychological testing , optional lumbar puncture , evaluate patient stable dose cholinesterase inhibitor 24 week , follow another 24 week memantine combination stable dose cholinesterase inhibitor . The purpose study characterize progression disease use MRS , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) biomarkers , cognitive outcome measure , determine whether change cognitive function neuropsychological testing correlate change MR spectroscopic and/or CSF biomarkers .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Study Memantine Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) common cause dementia . The current US prevalence estimate 4 million people , rank 8th lead cause mortality United States , account 60,000 death per year . Memantine new medication approve FDA treatment AD . Since works different transmitter system , use combination FDA-approved treatment AD , tacrine , donepezil , rivastigmine , galantamine ( collectively refer cholinesterase inhibitor ) . It remain determined effect currently available AD treatment underlie structural functional correlate dementia process . While preclinical evidence suggest memantine decrease neuronal toxicity vitro , clear whether translates beneficial effect patient AD . One pressing challenge underlie clinical trial AD need validate reliable surrogate biomarkers disease progression . Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) allow vivo detection measurement brain metabolite . The spectroscopic feature consistently observe AD patient , compare patient cause dementia , normal subject , elevate myo-inositol ( mI ) reduce N-acetylaspartate ( NAA ) . Evaluation cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) via lumbar puncture affords minimally invasive window biochemical substrate envelop brain . Multiple previous study AD patient compare control subject demonstrate decreased CSF beta-amyloid , elevate CSF tau protein . Previous longitudinal study document stability CSF beta-amyloid one year CSF tau two year AD , suggest may possible stable target measure therapeutic intervention . The purpose study characterize progression disease use MRS , CSF biomarkers , cognitive outcome measure patient mild moderate Alzheimer 's disease 24 week observational treatment stable dose cholinesterase inhibitor , another 24 week open-label memantine treatment addition stable dose cholinesterase inhibitor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent must obtain either subject ( decisional capacity ) Legally Authorized Representative ( LAR ) ( require state local law IRB ) , prior initiation studyspecific procedure . ( If subject unable fully consent himself/herself , capacity appoint research proxy , legally authorize research proxy ask sign consent , subject signing assent . ) Male female outpatient least 50 year age Screening . If female , patient must least two year postmenopausal surgically sterile Screening . The patient current diagnosis probable Alzheimer 's disease consistent NINCDSADRDA criterion . The patient knowledgeable reliable caregiver accompany patient clinic visit course study . MiniMental State Examination ( MMSE ) score least 15 great 26 Screening . Ongoing therapy stable dose donepezil , rivastigmine , galantamine least three month time Screening . Physical examination , laboratory evaluation , EKG result Screening must normal , abnormal finding must judge clinically significant Investigator . The patient 's MRI scan conduct part Screening ( Visit 1 ) must consistent diagnosis Alzheimer 's disease , must include finding could confound spectroscopic analysis subsequent MRIs ( e.g. , large cortical stroke , tumor , spaceoccupying brain lesion ) . Vision hearing ( hear aid permissible ) must sufficient compliance test procedure . The patient and/or Legally Authorized Representative , caregiver must able speak , read , understand English sufficiently understand nature study , provide write informed consent , allow completion study assessment . Clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency Screening . Patients modify Hachinski ischemia score great 4 Screening . Patients evidence clinically significant active pulmonary , gastrointestinal , renal , hepatic , endocrine , cardiovascular system disease . Patients control hypertension right bundle branch block ( complete partial ) may include study . Patients thyroid disease may also include study provide euthyroid treatment . Patients control diabetes may also include . Patients severe renal impairment ( estimate creatinine clearance &lt; 35 mL/min ) . Patients systolic blood pressure ( sit ) great 180 mm Hg le 90 mm Hg , diastolic blood pressure ( sit ) great 100 mm Hg le 50 mm Hg Screening . Patients evidence neurological disorder include , limited , stroke , Parkinson 's disease , seizure disorder , hydrocephalus , head injury loss consciousness within past five year Screening . Patients current DSMIV Axis I disorder Alzheimer 's disease , include schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder , bipolar disorder , current major depressive episode , psychosis , panic disorder , posttraumatic stress disorder . Patients dementia complicate organic disease . Patients previous brain scan ( MRI CT ) result inconsistent diagnosis probable Alzheimer 's disease . Patients oncological diagnosis ( hematological solid tumor ) currently treat , treatment within year precede Screening , still evidence active disease . ( Note : Patients local dermatological tumor basal squamous cell carcinoma may include . ) Patients object head neck would invalidate obstruct successful completion MRI scan , patient contraindication MRI , include implant ferromagnetic material device cardiac pacemaker , deep brain stimulators , cochlear implant , intraocular metallic shard . Patients claustrophobic and/or unable tolerate MRI Screening , Investigator believe able tolerate scan schedule course study . Patients know suspected history ( within past 5 year Screening ) alcoholism drug abuse . Patients unstable dose cholinesterase inhibitor ( donepezil , rivastigmine , galantamine ) , currently take one cholinesterase inhibitor Screening , likely require change cholinesterase drug dose course study , cholinesterase inhibitor therapy contraindicate . Patients history severe drug allergy hypersensitivity , patient know hypersensitivity memantine , amantadine , rimantadine , lactose . Patients previously treat participate investigational study neramexane , memantine , amantadine . Patients previously treat commercial memantine . Patients investigational drug study receive treatment investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) Screening . Patients caregiver unwilling unable abide visit schedule requirement study . Any condition would make patient caregiver unsuitable study opinion Investigator .</criteria>
