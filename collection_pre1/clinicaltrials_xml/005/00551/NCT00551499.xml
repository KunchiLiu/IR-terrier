	<brief_summary>The primary objective study compare Apnea- Hypopnea Index HF patient concomitant CSA , 12 week CRT alone CRT combination one night overdrive pacing . Secondary objective evaluate effect single night overdrive pacing apply 12 week CRT vs. CRT alone breathe event , sleep event , neurohormonal marker . An additional secondary objective study compare efficacy CRT HF patient concomitant CSA HF patient without concomitant CSA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy Combination With Overdrive Pacing Treatment Central Sleep Apnea CHF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep apnea common often undiagnosed disorder associate substantial cardiovascular morbidity mortality . In recent year study publish present relationship heart failure ( HF ) central sleep apnea ( CSA ) . CSA associate Cheyne-Stokes respiration form periodic breathing central apnea hypopnea alternate period hyperventilation , characterize regular crescendo-decrescendo oscillation tidal volume , think cause dysfunction central respiratory control . Unlike , obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , CSA likely arises consequence HF.Since 2002 , several result report benefit atrial overdrive ( AOP ) pace patient suffer sleep apnea . These result could confirm obstructive sleep apnea several subsequent study . Cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) propose another potential therapeutic pacing approach CSA two recently publish investigations.The combine therapeutic impact AOP CRT ( CRT+AOP ) far investigated.We aim evaluate effect CRT alone CRT+AOP CSA patient CHF .</detailed_description>
