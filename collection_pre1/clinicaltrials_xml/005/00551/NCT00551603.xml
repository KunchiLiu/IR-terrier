	<brief_title>Anaemia Correction Haemodialyzed Patients - Comparative Analysis Two Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents Schedules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently available ESAs include epoetin alfa , epoetin beta , darbepoetin . Epoetin alfa beta design resemble closely endogenous molecule similar pharmacokinetics . They consider `` short-acting '' comparison darbepoetin , second-generation molecule prolong half-life , consider `` long-acting . '' European American Best Practice Guidelines ( EBPG ) recommend preferential subcutaneous ( SC ) twice- thrice-weekly epoetin administration . There great deal evidence once-weekly SC administration epoetin beta equally efficient well tolerate HD patient , even require high weekly epoetin dos . Several recent report support efficacy every-other-week epoetinum administration maintenance phase anaemia treatment predialysis , haemodialysis peritoneal dialysis CKD patient . However , study suggest HD patient receive SC short-acting ESA therapy , ESA efficacy decrease dose extend thrice-weekly once-weekly administration . When every-2-week administration long-acting ESAs extend every 4 week , efficacy either remain stable decrease incrementally . The GAIN trial ( Gain effectiveness Anemia treatment NeoRecormon® ) design compare anemia management epoetin beta , epoetin alpha darbepoetin alpha HD patient . An interim analysis data 1005 stable HD patient suggest switch epoetin beta either epoetin alpha darbepoetin alpha result improved efficacy 20 % dose reduction SC epoetin beta . The aim study compare two schedule anaemia treatment HD patient use two different erythropoietic stimulating agent ( epoetinum beta v darbepoetinum ) respect efficacy anaemia correction haemoglobin ( Hb ) level stability . The trial design accord Guidelines study test equivalence different treatment regimen , conduct provision Declaration Helsinki Tokio amend Venice ( 1983 ) . This multicenter ( 2 center ) , prospective , open-label , parallel , controlled trial therapy equivalence . The total observation period 80 week : - The baseline phase ( pre-therapeutic intervention ) - 12 week ; - The first study phase therapeutical intervention - 48 week : two group patient receive anaemia treatment accord Romanian Best Practice Guidelines either epoetinum beta darbepoetinum ; - The second study phase therapeutical intervention - 24 week : patient epoetinum beta group switch darbepoetinum . The anaemia treatment continue accord Romanian Best Practice Guidelines , use recommend conversion factor 200 ( Romanian Best Practice Guidelines , NKF-DOQI 2006 , Revised EBPG ) . 300 haemodialyzed patient enrol .</detailed_description>
