	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial study side effect oregovomab see well work without cyclophosphamide treat patient stage III stage IV ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer respond second-line chemotherapy . Monoclonal antibody , oregovomab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether oregovomab effective give together without cyclophosphamide treat patient stage III stage IV ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oregovomab With Without Cyclophosphamide Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer That Responded Second-Line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize nonspecific humoral immune response , measure human anti-murine antibody ( HAMA ) , patient stage III IV ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma treat consolidation therapy comprise adjuvant oregovomab v without cyclophosphamide achieve complete clinical response second-line taxane/platinum-based therapy . II . To compare magnitude immune response patient approximately 14 week initial treatment . III . To determine frequency severity adverse event , assess NCI CTCAE v3.0 , patient treat regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize specific humoral immune response , measure HAMA anti-idiotype antibody , patient . II . To assess treatment emergent cellular immune response , measure delayed-type hypersensitivity response anergy panel oregovomab compare baseline , patient . III . To characterize duration patient 's first progression-free interval primary chemotherapy second progression-free interval another regimen chemotherapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) skin test oregovomab standard anergy panel ( i.e. , mumps , Candida , tetanus toxoid ) day 0 ( baseline ) week 14 . The skin test response measure 48 hour later . Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV day 6 oregovomab IV 20 minute day 9 10 . Patients receive oregovomab alone week 6 10 every 12 week 2 year ( 10 dos ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients undergo DTH skin test receive oregovomab arm I . Blood sample obtain patient baseline week 14 38 immunologic correlative study . Samples examine determine CA-125 level human anti-murine antibody ( HAMA ) anti-idiotype antibody level enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
