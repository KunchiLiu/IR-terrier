	<detailed_description>TITLE `` A phase II study association Glivec® ( Imatinib mesylate , formerly know STI 571 ) plus Gemzar® ( Gemcitabine ) patient unresectable , refractory , malignant mesothelioma express either PDGFR-beta C-Kit '' PURPOSE Primary objective phase II ➢ Efficacy , i.e. , response rate study drug Secondary objective phase II - Duration response - Time progression - Toxicity profile - Overall survival PRIMARY VARIABLE The primary efficacy variable phase II part study Best Overall Tumor Response , evaluate use `` Modified RECIST criterion assessment response malignant pleural mesothelioma '' SECONDARY VARIABLES - Progression-free survival ( PFS ) form 1st administration onwards - Overall survival - Safety criterion , accord NCI-CTC criterion version 3.0 EFFICACY Objective tumor response assesed use `` Modified RECIST criterion assessment response malignant pleural mesothelioma '' SAFETY - Adverse event - Vital sign - Clinical biohumoral finding TREATMENT SCHEDULE - Gemzar 500 mg/m2 , i.v. , day 1 8 21-days schedule , plus - Glivec 400 mg/die. , per os STATISTICAL DESIGN The study follow two-stage design , accord Simon model . We assume response rate 5 % ( H0 ) less drug likely ineffective , also , , drug effective , target response rate 15 % ( H1 ) require . With probability error alfa 5 % beta 20 % , calculated sample size report `` PLANNED NUMBER OF PTS . '' PLANNED NUMBER OF PTS . 23 56 patient , evaluable efficacy . The number depend response rate . When 2 objective response , i.e. , CR PR , observe first 23 patient , total number patient increase 56 , otherwise study stop STATISTICAL EVALUATION Efficacy safety variable evaluate descriptively . Indeed , ORR estimate exact 95 % confidence interval calculate . Kaplan-Meier method use estimate duration response , PFS OS DURATION OF TREATMENT All patient schedule receive least two cycle chemotherapy unless unacceptable toxicity , progressive disease , patient require asks withdrawal study Responding patient receive treatment 6 cycle earlier progression unbearable toxicity Disease status re-evaluated every two cycle , use imaging procedure use baseline , i.e. , CT NMR INCLUSION CRITERIA - Age &gt; 18 year &lt; 72 year - Patients histologically prove malignant mesothelioma pleura peritoneum , express either PDFGR-beta C-Kit immunochemistry ( ICH ) - Locally advanced disease , unsuitable curative surgical resection , metastatic disease - Confirmed progression disease accord modify REcist-criteria , document first-line , systemic ( premetrex+cisplatin regimen ) local treatment ( i.e. , intrapleuric ) - ECOG Performance Status 0 , 1 2 - Life expectancy least 3 month - Capability understand objective study give write informed consent - Willingness ability comply study requirement - Sufficient caloric fluid intake , include patient enteral parenteral nutrition EXCLUSION CRITERIA - Co-existing tumor different histologic origin , except non melanomatous localized skin cancer and/or situ cervical carcinoma - A history earlier tumor different histologic origin complete remission since less 5 year - Unresolved toxicity prior antitumor treatment ( ) - Primary peritoneal mesothelioma - Any following abnormal baseline hematological value : - Hb &lt; 9 g/dL - WBC &lt; 3 x 109/L - Neutrophils &lt; 1.5 x 109/L - Platelets &lt; 100 x 109/L - Serum bilirubin &gt; 2.5 mg/dL - ALAT ASAT &gt; 3 x UNL ( unless due liver metastasis ) - Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL - Clinically relevant cardiovascular disease , i.e. , myocardial infarction severe coronary artery disease within prior 6 month , cardiac arrythmia require medication , uncontrolled hypertension , overt cardiac failure non compensate chronic heart disease NYHA class II - History psychiatric disability , potentially interfere capability give adequate inform consent - Pregnant lactating woman inability/unwillingness practice medically approve method contraception study period ( include 3 month follow end treatment ) - Uncontrolled active infection - Any condition , judgement Investigator , would place patient undue risk interfere result study</detailed_description>
