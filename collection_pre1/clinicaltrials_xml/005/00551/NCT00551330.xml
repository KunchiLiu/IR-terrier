	<brief_summary>Vicriviroc ( vye-kri-VYE-rock ) investigational drug ( yet approve Government Regulatory Authorities commercial use ) belong new class drug , call CCR5 receptor blocker . This group drug block one way HIV enters T-cells ( cell fight infection ) . Previous small study HIV treatment-experienced patient , show vicriviroc safe effective . The purpose study investigate subject detectable dual/mixed CCR5/CXCR4-tropic HIV whether vicriviroc add appropriate HIV drug decrease level HIV ( viral load ) blood well tolerate . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , multi-center study vicriviroc maleate HIV subject infect dual/mixed CCR5/CXCR4-tropic virus document resistance least 2 3 antiretroviral drug class ( NRTI , NNRTI PI ) least 6 month experience least 2 follow : one NRTI , one NNRTI , one PI ( exclude low-dose ritonavir ) failure current stable regimen . The study compare virologic benefit add vicriviroc optimize background regimen control group receive placebo plus new optimize background therapy . The optimized background regimen choose investigator base result drug susceptibility test perform Screening , history prior antiretroviral drug use patient , drug toxicity . Primary efficacy analysis conduct subject complete 48 week treatment . An interim analysis perform subject complete 24 week treatment . Subjects complete 48 week treatment , discontinue early deem eligible upon rescreening , offer participation open-label segment study , receive vicriviroc 30 mg daily , appropriate , commercially available sponsor terminates clinical development vicriviroc .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must least 16 year age ( minimal age defines adult determine local regulatory authority legal requirement ) , either sex race , dual/mixed CCR5/CXCR4 tropic HIV infection . Subjects must treatment failure ( define plasma HIV RNA [ ribonucleic acid ] &gt; 1000 copies/mL ) exist regimen . Subjects must antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) experience document genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance least one drug 2 follow 3 drug class : nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) , nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) , protease inhibitor ( PI ) OR Antiretroviral class experience least 6 month ( sequential cumulative ) least two follow : one NRTI one NNRTI one PI ( exclude low dose ritonavir ) . In opinion investigator , best treatment regimen subject must optimize ART regimen consist &gt; =3 drug , optimize regimen must contain least 2 active drug , one must ritonavirboosted PI ( &gt; =100 mg ritonavir ) . With exception etravirine , NNRTIs may component optimized regimen . Any condition likely increase risk seizure . CD4 count &lt; 100 cells/mm^3 . Current prior history malignancy .</criteria>
