	<brief_title>A Safety Study Oral EGFR Inhibitor , AV-412 , Administered Three Times Weekly Advanced Solid Tumor Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , dose escalation trial , subject receive oral AV-412 administer three time weekly weekly 4 week ( 1 cycle ) evaluate safety tolerability AV-412 . Treatment duration minimum 2 consecutive dosing cycle ( 8 week ) , tolerate . - Upon completion 2 cycle , subject document stable disease objective response may continue receive therapy dose schedule previously utilized , long tolerability acceptable , 1 year . Treatment beyond 1 year time enrollment review case-by-case basis sponsor investigator . - Subjects experience unacceptable toxicity document disease progression discontinue participation study Accrual next cohort occur acceptable tolerance demonstrate throughout Cycle 1 , consultation medical monitor .</detailed_description>
