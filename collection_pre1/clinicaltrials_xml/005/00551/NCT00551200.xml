	<brief_title>Dose-Escalation Safety Study HPN-100 Treat Urea Cycle Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When protein break body , nitrogen form . In healthy individual , body combine nitrogen molecule create harmless substance call urea , excreted urine . Patients Urea Cycle Disorders ( UCD ) unable create much urea nitrogen , therefore , toxic level nitrogen accumulate body , cause harm . To treat patient , doctor usually patient consume less protein supplement certain amino acid may lack . A drug call Buphenyl® sometimes prescribe adjunctive treatment chronic maintenance UCD patient order keep ammonia level . Some issue Buphenyl® include high pill burden ( 40 pill per day ) , bad taste odor , high sodium content . Like Buphenyl® , HPN-100 provide alternate way body dispose nitrogen , urea cycle . Unlike Buphenyl® , HPN-100 odorless , tasteless , concentrated oil contain large amount sodium .</detailed_description>
