	<brief_summary>The specific aim propose study conduct prospective RSA clinical study Massachusetts General Hospital involve 50 patient receive primary total hip replacement . All patient receive vitamin E treat polyethylene acetabular insert . Short-term femoral head penetration long-term steady state wear polyethylene measure use RSA Martell analysis technique . Stability acetabular femoral component measure patient use RSA analysis . The stability cement femoral stem compare stability cementless femoral component well historic data literature . In addition , patient complete self-administered questionnaire ass clinical outcome surgery patient satisfaction .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female 20 75 year age Subjects require primary total hip replacement Subjects diagnosis osteoarthritis , avascular necrosis , traumatic arthritis Subjects demonstrate ability return MGH followup next five year . Subjects limited life span Subjects difficulty comprehend study protocol reason . Subjects inflammatory disease , previous infection require revision hip surgery . Subjects whose bony structure small femoral head le 32mm diameter must use . Subjects whose bony structure deviate substantially general norm sufficiently require nonstandard technique nonstandard implant . Specific example total dislocation hip , severe coxa vera deformity , severe form multiple epiphyseal dysplasia Subjects complex disease entity significantly increase risk surgery major platelet abnormality , hematological disorder , positive HIV major medical complication substantially reduce longevity . Female subject pregnant may suspect pregnant plan become pregnant participate study .</criteria>
