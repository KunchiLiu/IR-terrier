	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , fludarabine pixantrone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . It yet know whether give fludarabine together rituximab effective without pixantrone treat indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study fludarabine rituximab compare well work without pixantrone treat patient relapsed refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludarabine Rituximab With Without Pixantrone Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient relapse refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma treat fludarabine phosphate rituximab v without pixantrone . Secondary - To compare overall objective response rate ( complete response [ CR ] , unconfirmed complete response [ CRu ] , partial response [ PR ] ) patient . - To compare CR CRu rate patient . - To compare duration response time progression patient . - To compare overall survival disease-specific survival patient . - To compare safety ( include cardiac safety ) tolerability regimens patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index ( FLIPI ) score ( 0 1 v ≥ 2 ) , number prior treatment ( 1 2 v &gt; 2 ) , prior anti-CD20 regimen ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( control ) : Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 fludarabine phosphate IV day 2-4 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 courses* absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . - Arm II : Patients receive rituximab fludarabine phosphate arm I . Patients also receive pixantrone IV day 2 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 courses* absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . NOTE : *Only patient achieve complete response , unconfirmed complete response , partial response 4 course receive course 5 6 . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
