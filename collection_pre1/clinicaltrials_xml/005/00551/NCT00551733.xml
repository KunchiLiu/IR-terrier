	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin , paclitaxel , paclitaxel poliglumex , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether give carboplatin together paclitaxel poliglumex effective give carboplatin together paclitaxel treat non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study carboplatin paclitaxel poliglumex see well work compare carboplatin paclitaxel treat woman stage III , stage IV , recurrent non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin With Either Paclitaxel Poliglumex Paclitaxel Treating Women With Stage IIIB , Stage IV , Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare overall survival patient chemotherapy-naïve stage IIIB IV recurrent non-small cell lung cancer treat paclitaxel poliglumex carboplatin v paclitaxel carboplatin . Secondary - Compare progression-free survival woman treat regimen . - Compare disease control woman treat regimen . - Compare clinical benefit woman treat regimen . - Compare response rate woman treat regimen . - Compare quality life woman treat regimen . - Compare safety tolerability woman treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord age ( ≥ 60 v &lt; 60 year old ) , geographical location ( United States America , Canada , Australia v rest world ) , extent disease ( independent brain metastasis , i.e. , brain metastasis consider determine extent disease ) ( intrathoracic disease v extrathoracic disease ) , ECOG performance status ( 0 1 v 2 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive paclitaxel poliglumex IV 10 minute follow carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . - Arm II : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour follow carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . In arm , treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , course , completion study treatment Pain Assessment Patient Questionnaire , Pulmonary Symptom Index , Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy- Lung Cancer Subscale ( FACT-LCS ) ( country validate translation currently available ) . After completion study therapy , patient follow least monthly .</detailed_description>
