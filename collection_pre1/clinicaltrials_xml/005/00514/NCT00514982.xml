	<brief_summary>This study determine medical treatment colitis ( inflammation colon result loose bowel movement , rectal bleeding , belly pain ) use colitis condition , Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis , safe effective treat colitis patient Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome ( HPS ) . HPS hereditary disorder cause albinism , visual impairment , abnormal bleeding . Some patient also develop colitis , pulmonary fibrosis , kidney disease . Patients HPS colitis 18 year age old may eligible study . Participants receive treatment colitis symptoms one several study drug , include mesalamine ( 5-ASA ) , corticosteroid , infliximab 6-mercaptopurine , adalimumab tacrolimus . The drug add treatment plan one time find combination work best individual patient . Patients respond one medication may continue treatment combination 6 month . Regular clinic visit schedule blood test , symptom rating questionnaire periodic physical examination colonoscopy measure response treatment evaluate side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study detect pattern immune abnormality colitis associate Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome ( HPS ) . Additionally aim document clinical response tolerance conventional inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) therapy HPS patient active colitis associate Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome ( HPS ) . HPS rare autosomal recessive disorder cause dysfunctional lysosome-related organelle formation traffic result oculocutaneous albinism bleed diathesis secondary platelet dysfunction . Associated condition include pulmonary fibrosis , IBD , systemic ceroid deposition . The associated IBD report occur high frequency HPS-1 HPS-4 subtypes compare prevalence IBD non-HPS population . HPS IBD clinical feature ulcerative colitis ( UC ) Crohn 's disease , histologically resemble Crohn 's disease granuloma commonly see mucosa intestine . The pathogenesis HPS IBD fully understand little data beyond description clinical histologic manifestation publish . Furthermore report treatment colitis HPS patient largely anecdotal , experience suggest many patient may under-treated . HPS patient active colitis enrol prospective treatment study . Endpoints immunopathogenesis study include baseline measurement change immune cell population , cytokine , chemokine expression . In blood gut mucosa . Endpoints study response treatment include change clinical , endoscopic , histologic score well rate severity adverse event . Descriptive summary statistical analysis ( n , mean , median , standard deviation , minimum maximum range ) simple correlation clinical response variable immune parameter do .</detailed_description>
