	<brief_summary>Background : - Medullary thyroid carcinoma ( MTC ) common people genetic disorder call multiple endocrine neoplasia ( MEN ) . - Vandetanib experimental drug block defective protein receptor ( RET receptor ) find surface cancer cell people MEN . It think protein primary cause MTC people MEN . Objectives : - To study activity Vandetanib child adolescents MEN-related MTC measuring change tumor size , blood level protein produce tumor ( calcitonin CEA ) tumor-related diarrhea . - To determine safety tolerability Vandetanib child adolescent . - To study body handle Vandetanib child adolescent . - To determine effect Vandetanib survival child adolescent MTC . Eligibility : -Children adolescent 5 18 year age MTC whose tumor surgically remove grown back treatment metastasize ( spread beyond thyroid gland ) . Design : - Patients take Vandetanib day 28-day cycle . The first patient enrol study start low dose Vandetanib determine tolerability . - Patients periodic blood test , electrocardiogram , blood pressure measurement look side effect Vandetanib . - Blood test image scan ( MRI , CT , bone octreoscan ) do every 8 week first 32 week treatment every 16 week duration treatment period . - Patients tumor-related diarrhea keep daily record number consistency bowel movement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma ( MTC ) , rare calcitonin-producing tumor arise parafollicular C cell thyroid , often manifestation multiple endocrine neoplasia ( MEN ) type 2A 2B detected child young five year MEN 2A one year MEN 2B MEN result activate mutation RET proto-oncogene result constitutively activate receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) Vandetanib orally bioavailable multi-RTK inhibitor block mutant RET gene product anti-tumor activity adult hereditary MTC OBJECTIVES : To assess activity vandetanib child adolescent hereditary MTC use RECIST ( primary endpoint ) , tumor biomarkers tumor-related diarrhea To assess safety tolerance navdetanib child adolescent dose equivalent recommend dose adult To assess pharmacokinetics vandetanib steady state child adolescent Secondary objective include monitor progression-free overall survival , assess RET , EGFR , VEGFR andsomatostatin receptor expression archival tumor tissue , assess change DNA mutation RET tumor tissue v germ line PBMC treatment ; assess gene expression gains/lossess DNA tumor tissue baseline , treatment time progression ; establishment pediatric MTC cell line sensitive resistant cell line vitro ELIGIBILITY : Children adolescents 5 18 year age ( inclusive ) unresectable , recurrent metastatic hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma Measurable disease RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) DESIGN : Vandetanib administer daily dose , continuously ( 1 cycle equal 28 day ) dose 150 mg , ( 2 ) , per day To ensure safety adult dose child adolescent , limited intra-patient dose escalation perform initial cohort patient , old patient ( 13 to18yrs ) study young patient ( 5 to12 yr ) Patients wil enrol dose 100mg , ( 2 ) , per day ( 180 mg per day adult ) two 28 day cycle escalate 150 mg , ( 2 ) , per day ( 270 mg , per day adult ) cycle 3 , dose limit toxicity observe low dose . If 150mg , ( 2 ) , per day dose level tolerable cycle 3 4 , subsequent patient enrol dose level Pharmacokinetics vandetanib study steady state end cycle 2 trough level obtain prior second dose cycle 1 , day 1 cycle 2-5 . Responsible measurable tumor assess RECIST . Biomarker clinical response also monitor . Twenty one patient studied determine response rate child adolescent hereditary MTC consistent 28 percent objective response rate adult</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age : Participants must 5 18 year age , inclusive . The first cohort 3 6 participant enrolled trial least 13 year age . Diagnosis : Hereditary ( MEN 2A MEN 2B ) medullary thyroid carcinoma ( histologically confirm ) unresectable , recurrent metastatic . Participants must previously characteristic germline mutation RET protooncogene document . Results germline mutation test obtain refer institution . Participants must measurable disease define RECIST presence least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension long diameter least 20 mm use conventional technique least 10 mm spiral CT scan . Superficial ( easily palpable ) lymph node consider measurable . Participants must able take one theoral formulation vandetanib . Prior therapy : There standard chemotherapy regimen know effective MTC . Therefore , previously untreated partipants eligible tumor ( ) surgically resectable . Participants must least 4 week prior surgical procedure surgical incision must heal . Participants must last fraction external beam radiation therapy least 4 week prior enrollment . Participants must last dose cytotoxic chemotherapy least 28 day prior enrollment , last dose biological therapy , biological response modifier ( e.g. , cytokine ) , immunomodulatory agent , vaccine , differentiate agent , use treat cancer least 7 day prior enrollment , last dose monoclonal antibody least 30 day prior enrollment , last dose investigational agent least 30 day prior enrollment . Participants must receive last dose short act colony stimulate factor , filgrastim sargramostim least 72 hour prior enrollment last dose longacting colony stimulate factor , PEGfilgrastim least 7 day prior enrollment . Participants must recover acute toxic effect prior therapy grade 1 ( CTCAE v.3.0 ) level prior enrollment . Performance Status : Lansky ( participant 10 year age young ) Karnofsky ( participant older 10 year ) performance score great 50 Concomitant Medications : Participants previously thyroidectomy thyroid hormone replacement therapy . Hematological Function : The peripheral absolute neutrophil count must least 1,500 micro liter platelet count must least 100,000 micro liter within 72 hour prior enrollment . Coagulation : PT PTT must 1.5 x ULN within 72 hour prior enrollment . PT PTT drawn venipuncture , rather central venous catheter feasible . Hepatic Function : Bilirubin must 1.5 x ULN AST ALT must 2.5 x ULN within 72 hour prior enrollment . AST ALT may 5 x ULN within 72 hour prior enrollment participant hepatic metastasis .
