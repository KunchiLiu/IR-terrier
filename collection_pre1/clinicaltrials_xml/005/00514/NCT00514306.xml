	<brief_title>Study Intermittent OSI-906 Dosing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicenter , open-label , phase 1 , cohort dose escalation . The study open Dosing Schedule 1 ( S1 ) ( OSI-906 Once Daily ( QD ) Days 1-3 every 14 day ) . Dosing Schedule 2 ( S2 ) ( OSI-906 QD Days 1-5 every 14 day ) initiate follow observation clinically significant related toxicity ≥ grade 2 S1 review preliminary safety pharmacokinetic data ≥ 6 dose level S1 indicate toxicity acceptable potential improvement exposure may achieve increased number dosing day . Dosing Schedule 3 ( S3 ) ( OSI-906 QD Days 1-7 every 14 day ) occur upon observation clinically significant related toxicity ≥ grade 2 S2 ≥ 1 dose level S2 examine . A 3-patient bridging dose cohort open S1 qualitatively compare 25 mg capsule 100 mg capsule dosage strengths order confirm gross difference safety exposure exist formulation . In order characterize tablet , 6-patient dose cohort open qualitatively examine pharmacokinetics dosage form . Once MTD determine S1 safety pharmacokinetic data tablet cohort review , Fed-Fasted Expansion Cohort open .</detailed_description>
