	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage D0 Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine whether ONY-P1 vaccine increase time PSA-defined progression patient androgen-dependent stage D0 prostate cancer . Secondary - To evaluate toxicity relate ONY-P1 vaccine . - To compare immunologic response patient treat ONY-P1 vaccine v placebo . - To evaluate PSA kinetics ( double time/velocity ) treatment . - To evaluate time testosterone recovery follow limited androgen ablation . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord estimate PSA double time ( &lt; 12 month vs ≥ 12 month ) . Patients receive goserelin subcutaneously . Approximately 3 month later , patient randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive ONY-P1 vaccine BCG intradermally day 1 15 . Patients receive ONY-P1 vaccine alone day 29 every 4 week 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive placebo vaccine intradermally day 1 , 15 , 29 every 4 week 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 15 year .</detailed_description>
