	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To determine feasibility deliver autologous dendritic cell ( DCs ) load acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) lysate plus messenger RNA ( mRNA ) AML patient follow consolidation therapy . 2 . To determine toxicity autologous DCs load AML lysate plus mRNA . 3 . To quantitate immune response patient receive autologous DCs load AML lysate plus mRNA . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To evaluate minimal residual disease follow DC therapy use polymerase chain reaction assay Wilm 's Tumor-1 gene . 2 . To asses disease-free overall survival AML patient receive autologous DCs load AML lysate plus mRNA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Acute Myelogenous Leukemia mRNA Plus Lysate Loaded Dendritic Cell Vaccines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient Consent : Arm 1 - Standard-Dose Consolidation The vaccine make AML cell kill , frozen , store away start study . When go remission , researcher take normal blood cell culture laboratory become `` dendritic cell . '' Researchers thaw tumor cell load part dendritic cell inject mixture . This type vaccine hopefully encourage immune system prevent later relapse disease . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn make sure infection HIV/AIDS . If , eligible study . If find eligible take part study , AML cell collect blood vein arm . A blood separator device call apheresis machine use . Each apheresis procedure take 3-5 hour . It similar donate platelet blood bank . During procedure blood tumor cell remove returned second line arm . You may bone marrow aspiration instead general anesthesia , usually last 3 hour . To collect bone marrow aspirate , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . The AML cell collect either apheresis bone marrow collection procedure use later make vaccine M. D. Anderson Cell Therapy Laboratory frozen store time make vaccine . After AML cell collect , start receive induction consolidation chemotherapy treatment . This treatment standard care directly relate participation study . After first cycle consolidation treatment , bone marrow biopsy do find complete remission . To collect bone marrow biopsy , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . If complete remission normal blood stem cell collect , use make vaccine . All normal stem cell collect apheresis machine use collect tumor cell . Beginning 5 day first collection , receive daily injection skin granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) . These give increase number normal stem cell available collection . On Days 5 6 G-CSF treatment , normal stem cell collect . They take M. D. Anderson Cell Therapy Laboratory frozen store time make vaccine . After complete apheresis procedure collect normal cell , continue consolidation therapy ( typically 3-5 cycle ) . The vaccine make previously frozen cell . Once thaw , machine call CliniMACS use isolate cell blood grown vaccine 8-day procedure . After last consolidation cycle , begin receive 4 monthly injection vaccine . The first vaccination give blood count recover final dose chemotherapy . The remain 3 vaccination give every 28 day ( +/- 7 day ) . Once ready , vaccine inject lymph node groin . A special machine call sonogram ( typically use look baby womb ) use painlessly locate exactly injection go . About 3-7 day vaccine , 4 tablespoon blood drawn measure immune reaction vaccine . At time also skin test perform look presence absence immune reaction vaccine . This do small injection skin forearm . About 48 hour later , researcher measure area around injection redness , would sign immune system react vaccine . After receive 4 vaccine , see clinic yearly evaluate tolerate vaccine . Routine long-term follow-up exam perform leukemia doctor per standard care . This investigational study . The vaccine commercially available authorize use research . A total 40 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson . Patient Consent : Arm 2 - Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Consolidation The vaccine make AML cell kill , frozen , store away start study .

Anderson Cell Therapy Laboratory frozen store time make vaccine . After complete apheresis procedure collect normal cell , continue consolidation therapy high-dose standard busulfan cyclophosphamide chemotherapy . You also autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplant . The chemotherapy transplant standard care . After chemotherapy transplant blood count recover , begin receive 4 monthly injection vaccine . The vaccine make previously frozen cell . Once thaw , machine call CliniMACS use isolate cell blood grown vaccine eight day procedure . The first vaccination give blood count recover final dose chemotherapy . The remain 3 vaccination give every 28 day ( +/- 7 day ) . Once ready , vaccine inject lymph node groin .
