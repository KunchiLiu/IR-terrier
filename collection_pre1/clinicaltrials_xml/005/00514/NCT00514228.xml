	<brief_title>Sunitinib Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Demonstrate antitumor activity continuous sunitinib malate treatment patient unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma . Secondary - Evaluate safety sunitinib malate treatment . - Measure serum cobalamin ( i.e. , vitamin B12 ) level sunitinib malate treatment order investigate relationship sunitinib malate treatment cobalamin deficiency . - Control cobalamin deficiency cobalamin replacement . - Investigate whether change tumor density could use criterion tumor response future trial . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood sample collection day 1 course ass serum cobalamin level correlation sunitinib malate treatment . Patients also assess change tumor density correlation response . Baseline CT scan compare scan perform 6 12 week evaluate change CT-scan density due tumor necrosis response . After completion study therapy , patient follow least every 3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
