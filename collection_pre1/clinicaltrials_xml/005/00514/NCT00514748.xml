	<brief_summary>Bilateral DIEP flap need two group vessel pedicle . We suppose bilateral DIEP flap may survive one vessel pedicle mean interconnection bilateral DIEA . This study aim build interconnect vessel system bilateral DIEP flap base one vessel pedicle observe survival breast reconstruction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Bilateral Interconnected DIEP Flap Based One Vessel Pedicle Breast Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The DIEP flap become common primary choice autogenous tissue breast reconstruction nowadays . In case inadequate abdominal soft-tissue volume abdominal midline scar , bilateral DIEP flap needed.However , need two group recipient vessel . So unavailable case short two group recipient vessel radiotherapy . This study aim solve problem interconnect one branch DIEA side . The MDCT use predict branch perforators DIEA side . According branch DIEAs , one branch anastomose contralateral side one vessel pedicle preserve one side . We believe whole flap completely nourish one vessel pedicle mean vessel interconnection .</detailed_description>
