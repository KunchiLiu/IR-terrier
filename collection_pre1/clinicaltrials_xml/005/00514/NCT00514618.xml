	<brief_summary>A. Null Hypothesis : In term pregnancy complicate diabetes , difference time interval start induction delivery outpatient cervical ripen labor induction initiate orally administer misoprostol , prostaglandin El analogue , compare placebo . B . Specific aim : 1 . Demonstrate oral misoprostol effective cervical ripening compare placebo give outpatient basis woman pregnancy complicate diabetes mellitus . 2 . Demonstrate oral misoprostol administer safely outpatient setting . The patient observe period four hour outpatient antepartum test unit medication administer demonstrate fetal well verify evidence uterine hyperstimulation . ( We acknowledge marker serious adverse maternal neonatal outcome rare , adequately address large multicenter trial . ) 3 . Assess cost differential inpatient outpatient utilization misoprostol cervical ripen labor induction . In order estimate impact outpatient cervical ripening may total hospitalization cost , use daily hospital charge publish data regard pharmaceutical cost .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outpatient Cervical Ripening With Orally Administered Misoprostol Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study propose single center study . Study participant recruit high risk obstetrical diabetic resident clinic , Magella Women 's Perinatal Group , Fetal Diagnostics Miller Children 's hospital . The resident clinic supervise faculty division Maternal Fetal Medicine department Obstetrics Gynecology . Patients class A1 , A2 diabetes mellitus term usually consider inpatient cervical ripen labor induction approach participation study . Informed consent obtain member perinatal research team . One hundred twenty-eight patient enrol assess treatment efficacy . Sixty four patient treat misoprostol 50mcg PO q day two day ( day 1 4 ) sixty four patient receive placebo ( vitamin C ) q day two day ( day 1 4 ) cervical ripen labor induction . Sample size calculation perform assume 50 % untreated patient deliver within 7 day entry . Using estimate 50 % increase number 75 % would clinically important , assume Type I error 0.05 Type II error 0.2 , calculate sample size 58 patient group necessary . The test one-sided . Assuming 10 % loss follow-up rate , sixty four patient need group . A predetermined randomization schedule 128 patient establish randomization assignment place opaque , seal envelope . The randomization perform use computer-generated random number table . The pharmacy prepare distribute study medication accord randomization schedule eligible participant sign inform consent . Once patient randomize , pharmacy contact provide medication research/antepartum test unit nurse . The propose study length two year , time need enroll 128 total participant . Each individual 's total participation time need complete protocol . After delivery , prenatal hospital chart participant review data abstract . Outpatient Procedures : 1 . Initial complete history physical exam physician clinic , include cervical exam . 2 . The patient send antepartum test unit undergo non-stress test amniotic fluid index measurement indicator fetal well-being . 3 . Candidates approach study participation inform consent obtain . 4 . The pharmacy contact randomization provision study medication . 5 . A research nurse physician , train labor delivery , responsible administration study medication ( 50 mcg misoprostol placebo ) . 6 . The patient observe antepartum test unit period 4 hour receipt study medication . 1 . Adequate uterine activity define &gt; =3 uterine contraction ( UC 's ) 10 minute . Inadequate uterine activity define &lt; =2/10 minute . Continued adequate uterine activity require continue observation labor delivery unit . If cessation uterine activity observation labor delivery fetal heart rate pattern remain reassure , patient discharge home return three four day second dose medication oxytocin , appropriate . 2 . Adequate cervical ripening : If , follow receipt medication , patient demonstrates change cervical score &gt; 6 , admit delivery . 3 . If spontaneous labor ensues , patient demonstrate uterine hyperstimulation , transfer labor delivery unit . 7 . If period observation , fetal heart rate testing remain reassure patient labor develop adequate contraction pattern , discharge home . 8 . If discharge home , patient instruct return 3 4 day later ( coincident standard antepartum test protocol ) re-evaluation second dose study medication . 9 . On second day coincident antepartum test , repeat cervical examination perform research nurse , resident attendant physician . Non Stress Test perform . If Bishop score &gt; 6 , patient admit labor delivery oxytocin augmentation labor . If Bishop score le , Non Stress Test reactive , amniotic fluid index normal , uterine activity minimal , administer second dose 50 mcg oral misoprostol . Observation antepartum test unit 4 hour . Again , labor ensue fetal heart rate remain reassure , patient send home instruction return 3-4 day later coincident standard NST . 10 . On morning seventh day ( one week enrollment receipt first dose oral misoprostol , 39 Â½ week ' gestational age ) , patient admit labor delivery unit undergo inpatient cervical ripen oral misoprostol , oxytocin induction augmentation appropriate . 11 . All patient discharge home day 1 4 instructed observe sign labor rupture membrane , assess fetal movement home . They instruct return emergency room experience uterine contraction occur often every 5 minute 1 hour , rupture membrane , heavy vaginal bleeding decrease fetal movement . 12 . A 24-hour emergency phone number provide patient enrol study protocol . 13 . Labor management active phase labor unit discretion manage physician . Labor delivery admission procedure : 1 . Intravenous access obtain . 2 . Standard laboratory study draw , include Type screen , complete blood count , capillary blood glucose . 3 . Continuous external fetal monitoring external tocodynamometry utilize . 4 . A cervical examination perform physician . NOTE : These ( 1-4 ) standard procedure apply patient admit labor delivery . Misoprostol Inpatient Administration : Those patient remain unripened cervix uterine contraction less 12/hour completion day 1 4 outpatient treatment candidate receive misoprostol inpatient day 7 per follow protocol . 1 . The dosing schedule follow : 100 microgram misoprostol give orally every 4 hour maximum 6 dos . ( The medication provide pharmacy ) . A . The maximum cervical ripening period 24 hour . After 24 hour misoprostol , patient enter active labor , induction process may continue oxytocin necessary . B . Continued , regular uterine activity ( 3 uterine contraction 10 minute period ) preclude repeat dose . 2 . In event spontaneous rupture membrane , patient receive dos misoprostol . Oxytocin may utilize augment labor discretion manage physician . 3 . If patient develops uterine contraction abnormality define , either terbutaline , 0.25 mg IV SQ MgSO4 intravenous infusion may administer necessary . If abnormality encounter oxytocin administration , infusion discontinue treatment may utilize . 4 . The maximum time period cervical ripening misoprostol 24 hour , may follow immediately adequate trial oxytocin , usually exceed 24 hour . Thus , inpatient cervical ripening/induction attempt exceed 48 hour . Oxytocin Induction/ Augmentation ( necessary ) : 1 ) These patient receive oxytocin infusion accord standard labor delivery protocol Miller Children 's Hospital . Study Outcomes : The primary outcome measure time interval start induction delivery . Other outcome measure number dose medication require , oxytocin requirement , route delivery . The number patient admit labor delivery active labor also assess interval change Bishop 's score application medication . Also intrapartum complication include uterine hyperstimulation , fetal distress excessive bleeding time delivery compare , adverse maternal neonatal outcome , e.g. , development endometritis admission NICU respectively . Expected Outcomes : We anticipate approximately 20 % patient receive misoprostol enter active phase labor require transfer labor delivery . We also anticipate find significant difference Bishop 's score two group day 1 4 , find significantly short time interval start induction delivery patient receive active agent .</detailed_description>
