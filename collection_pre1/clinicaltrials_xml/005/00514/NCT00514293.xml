	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bexarotene tretinoin may cause tumor cell look like normal cell , grow spread slowly . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , carboplatin , docetaxel , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bexarotene tretinoin together combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well give bexarotene together tretinoin combination chemotherapy work treat patient stage III stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate efficacy bexarotene dose 375 mg daily 4 day tretinoin also 3 day chemotherapy patient advance non-small cell lung cancer . - Evaluate safety tolerability drug combination . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral bexarotene 375 mg daily oral tretinoin 50 mg twice daily day 1-3 . Patients also receive combination chemotherapy comprise cisplatin carboplatin docetaxel capecitabine orally intravenously day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 week .</detailed_description>
