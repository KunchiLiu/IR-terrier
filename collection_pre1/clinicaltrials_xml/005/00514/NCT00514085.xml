	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess efficacy , term objective response rate , nonprogression rate , time progression , response duration , patient metastatic recurrent malignant melanoma treat recombinant human interleukin-21 ( rIL-21 ) . - To assess toxicity safety rIL-21 patient previously untreated metastatic recurrent malignant melanoma . - To characterize pharmacokinetics rIL-21 . - To characterize effect rIL-21 lymphocyte cell count soluble CD25 ( sCD25 ) serum potential biomarkers drug activity . - To evaluate immunogenicity rIL-21 , specifically preexist immunogenicity drug antibody induction treatment . - To assess melanoma antigenic marker response nonprogression archival tissue patient enrol study . Secondary - To investigate whether rIL-21 induce sCD25 release independent level circulate sCD25 . - To investigate effect rIL-21 antibody induction treatment preexist immunogenicity . - To assess lymphocyte cell-count change time relation rIL-21 therapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive recombinant human interleukin-21 ( rIL-21 ) IV day 1-5 week 1 , 3 5 . Treatment repeat every 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) receive 2 course beyond CR PR . Patients stable disease receive maximum 3 course rIL-21 . Previously archive tumor tissue blood sample collect patient correlative study . Samples analyze soluble CD25 , rIL-21 antibody , circulate lymphocyte count , preexist immonogenicity rIL-21 antibody induction , expression common melanoma tumor antigen marker via IHC . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
