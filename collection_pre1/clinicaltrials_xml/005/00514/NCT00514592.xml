	<detailed_description>All patient carotid stenosis &gt; 50 % accord NASCET-criteria include . The study affect health care patient receive . The time symptom surgery compare outcome CEA 45 day , 6 month , 1 year 5 year . An intervention form new practical local regional guideline January 2009 ( # 17 29 study month ) aim reduce delay increase patient safety . PRIMARY AIM : To study risk Ipsilateral stroke , stroke , death , cerebrovascular event , cardiovascular event . Two primary analysis : 1 . Ipsilateral ischemic stroke within 90 Days present event . This analysis aim short term risk pre-operative stroke . Survival analysis use . CEA use censor , thus exclude peri-operative postoperative stroke . 2 . All primary endpoint within 5 year present event . This analysis aim att long term risk cardio-vascular morbidity mortality . Secondary analysis : 1 ) Same first primary analysis , include stroke endpoint , ipsilateral ischemic stroke . SECONDARY AIM : To attempt validate different risk score system already publish source . Such ABCD2-score use safely chose acute fast normal screen carotid stenosis ?</detailed_description>
