	<brief_title>Sunitinib Treating Patients With Relapsed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess number response patient relapse multiple myeloma treat sunitinib ( sunitinib malate ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity sunitinib malate patient relapse multiple myeloma . II . To assess time progression initial response sunitinib malate . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily day 1-42 . Treatment repeat every 42 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
