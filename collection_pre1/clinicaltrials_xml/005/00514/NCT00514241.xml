	<brief_title>Evaluate Use Gravitational Platelet Separation System Leg Wound Healing Coronary Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative wound disturbance , particularly surgical site infection chest leg incision site follow cardiac surgery associate increased morbidity , mortality , cost . A recent dissertation National hospital Norway show 20 % infection rate wound bypass surgery , probably representable nation wide . Prophylactic intervention reduce postoperative wound disturbance infection would inherent value cardiothoracic surgery . Ideally , specific intervention would demonstrate improved patient outcome reduce output hospital resource . The aim platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) application accelerate heal cascade via application elevate cytokine concentration release platelet degranulation . It hypothesize elevated cytokine level elucidate accelerate heal response affect tissue . PPP application also advocate tissue sealant topical hemostasis . This prospective randomized study effect autologous platelet concentrate application surgical closure follow vein harvest coronary bypass surgery . This prophylactic measure compare standard surgical closure technique primary outcome incidence leg wound infection .</detailed_description>
