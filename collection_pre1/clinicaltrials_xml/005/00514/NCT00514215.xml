	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Cryotherapy kill tumor cell freeze . Giving injection GM-CSF cryotherapy inhale GM-CSF cryotherapy may interfere growth tumor cell shrink tumor . Giving cryotherapy together GM-CSF may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give cryotherapy together GM-CSF work treat patient lung metastasis primary lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine whether percutaneous cryotherapy combination aerosolize sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) demonstrable immunologic effect patient pulmonary metastasis primary lung cancer . - Determine whether systemic immune response detectable combination cryotherapy antigen presentation source GM-CSF immunologic adjuvant . - Determine whether low morbidity maintain patient treated regimen . - Determine whether effective immunization associate drop CD4+ , CD25+ , LTP ( TGF-β1 ) + , Tr cell measure flow cytometry ELISPOT assay TGF-β1-secreting cell . Secondary - Determine clinical response ( i.e. , tumor control dominant mass undergo cryotherapy metastatic site ) measure CT criterion . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients undergo CT-guided core biopsy dominant lung mass placement least 2 cryoprobes . Prior initiating freeze , patient receive interstitial injection sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) near tumor . Patients undergo percutaneous cryotherapy 2 hour utilize freeze-thaw-freeze cycle . Beginning within 3 day cryotherapy , patient receive aerosolize GM-CSF twice daily 1 week . Beginning day 32 , patient may elect undergo second course treatment describe absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood tumor tissue collection baseline periodically study immunological correlative study . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolate blood sample analyze antigen-specific CD4-positive CD8-positive T-cell response flow cytometry TGF-β1 ELISPOT assay measure TGF-β1- secreting cell . Tumor cell lysates extract tumor sample pulse autologous dendritic cell analyze ELISPOT assay measure T-cell reactivity tumor specimen . After completion study therapy , patient follow 6 12 month .</detailed_description>
