	<brief_title>PDS v Polyamide Midline Abdominal Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>64 patient undergoing midline laparotomy allocate , use block randomization , mass closure abdominal wall continuous polyamide ( 34 patient ) continuous polydioxanone ( 30 patient ) . There alarmingly high incidence wind dehiscence PDS group require secondary suturing ( Nylon 0 ; PDS 5 ) . Mid-way trial , interim analysis perform reveal unacceptably high incidence wind dehiscence PDS group . This necessitated premature curtailment study . There , however , statistically significantly high incidence scar pain Nylon group ( Nylon 9 ; PDS 1 ) . There need study large series , PDS choice suture midline wound closure recommend .</detailed_description>
