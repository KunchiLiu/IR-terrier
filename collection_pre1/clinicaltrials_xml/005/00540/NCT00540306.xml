The Researcher determine 1 ) large variation breast tissue component 2 ) predictable repeatable variation 3 ) effect endogenous hormone breast tissue physiology .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Monitoring Functional Variation Breast During Menstrual Cycle Using Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Variations breast physiology due hormonal fluctuation menstrual cycle correlate quantitative change Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy functional parameter hemoglobin , lipid water concentration tissue scatter . Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy image show increase blood flow breast tissue ovulation concomitant increase mitotic activity , change hemoglobin concentration tissue scatter . Increases fibroglandular breast tissue ovulation also observe . Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy image determine time ovulation detect two month self-monitoring .</detailed_description>
