	<brief_summary>Atherosclerosis , condition fatty deposit plaque build along inner wall artery , condition may increase risk heart attack . Previous study show presence specific kind plaque , know vulnerable plaque , often find people heart attack . This study use new imaging technique call optical frequency domain imaging ( OFDI ) examine presence vulnerable plaque people coronary artery disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identifying Vulnerable Plaques Blood Vessels Heart Using New Imaging Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis condition deposit fat , cholesterol , substance build along inner wall artery ; deposit know plaque . As plaque build , increase risk heart attack . Previous autopsy study show vulnerable plaque , type atherosclerotic plaque , commonly find people heart attack . Until recently difficult identify vulnerable plaque people prior death . Many people coronary artery disease risk heart attack undergo angioplasty , procedure open narrow blocked blood vessel . During angioplasty , imaging device often use take picture inside blood vessel . The commonly use imaging device , intravenous ultrasound ( IVUS ) catheter , thread blood vessel use sound wave take picture . An OFDI new type catheter take detailed picture blood vessel wall plaque . The additional detail provide OFDI image may improve detection vulnerable plaque , may help physicians identify people high risk heart attack . This study use standard IVUS image OFDI examine vulnerable plaque within blood vessel heart evaluate change occur time heart blood vessel plaque . This study enroll people coronary artery disease undergo angioplasty . At baseline study visit , participant first undergo angiography procedure , x-ray picture take heart blood vessel . Participants randomly assign undergo either IVUS procedure follow OFDI procedure vice versa . Repeat angiography occur imaging procedure . Next , participant undergo angioplasty stent place area blood vessel narrow blocked keep blood vessel open . Finally , participant undergo repeat IVUS OFDI procedure . For participant , study physician may perform IVUS OFDI procedures angioplasty . Every six month period two year , participant complete questionnaire medication history heart problem may occur since baseline visit.Blood collection occur do office visit .</detailed_description>
