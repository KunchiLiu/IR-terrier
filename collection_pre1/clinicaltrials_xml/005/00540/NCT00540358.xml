	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical trial determine whether combine iniparib ( BSI-201 ) standard chemotherapy estrogen receptor ( ER ) -negative , progesterone receptor ( PR ) -negative , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) negative metastatic breast cancer patient improve clinical benefit compare treatment standard chemotherapy alone . Based data generate BiPar/Sanofi , conclude iniparib posse characteristic typical poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitor class . The exact mechanism yet fully elucidate , however base experiment tumor cell perform laboratory , iniparib novel investigational anti-cancer agent induces gamma-H2AX ( marker DNA damage ) tumor cell line , induces cell cycle arrest G2/M phase tumor cell line , potentiates cell cycle effect DNA damage modality tumor cell line . Investigations potential target iniparib metabolite ongoing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Trial Standard Chemotherapy , With Without BSI-201 , Patients With Triple Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients treat disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , Investigator 's decision discontinue , withdrawal consent . After treatment discontinuation , patient evaluate every 90 day last dose gemcitabine/carboplatin without iniparib , 3 year death end study , ever occur first .</detailed_description>
