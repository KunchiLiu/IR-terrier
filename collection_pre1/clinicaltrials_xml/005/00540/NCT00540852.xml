	<brief_summary>Optimal management patient locally advance breast cancer remain complex therapeutic problem . Newly diagnose breast cancer United States high incidence medically underserved area . The optimal intensity duration neoadjuvant chemotherapy still remain controversial due difficulty evaluate response therapy . The goal would prevent treatment patient neoadjuvant chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Researcher develop diagnostic device call Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging non-invasive optical technique utilizes intensity-modulated , near-infrared light quantitatively measure optical property thick tissue . Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging image tissue hemoglobin , oxygen saturation , blood volume fraction , water content , fat content cellular structure . The measurement provide quantitative optical property value reflect change tissue perfusion , oxygen consumption , cell/matrix development . There therapeutic benefit subject , especially none might influence indication diagnostic procedure indicate . However , information obtain may lead new form non-invasive image early detection breast cancer .</detailed_description>
