	<brief_title>Optical Biopsy Human Skin Conjunction With Laser Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Optical measurement provide quantitative optical property value reflect change tissue perfusion , oxygen consumption , cell/matrix development . Each measurement require less 5 minute execute . The measurement take skin treatment.This non-invasive , non-contact technique great potential mean diagnose different skin problem without need obtain piece tissue skin .</detailed_description>
