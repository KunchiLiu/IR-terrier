	<brief_summary>The purpose study improve efficacy pulse dye laser treatment port wine stain birthmark . Involvement protocol involve formal documentation level treatment pain , duration post-treatment purpura incidence side effect . In addition , measurement take blood substance promote blood vessel formation/regrowth non-invasive reflectance measurement photograph take treatment . The objective study document degree port wine stain lightening , incidence side effect presence angiogenic factor induce treatment pulse dye laser association cool agent . This information ultimately lead improve treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser offer best result low incidence side effect . The yellow light preferentially absorb hemoglobin allow selective destruction ectatic capillary dermis . The flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser become treatment choice port wine stain birthmark ; however , therapeutic challenge remain . The epidermis totally spar due partial absorption energy therein melanin present optical barrier light must pass reach underlie blood vessel . Absorption laser energy melanin cause localized heating epidermis , may , control , produce permanent complication hypertrophic scar dyspigmentation . Clinical study demonstrate efficacy safety cryogen spray cool pulse laser treatment port wine stain birthmark . This technology allow use high incident laser light dosage demonstrate improve treatment result . cryogen spray cool also decrease treatment pain duration post-laser treatment purpura .</detailed_description>
