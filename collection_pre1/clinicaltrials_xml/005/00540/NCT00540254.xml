	<brief_title>Behavioral Insomnia Therapy With Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome ( CFS ) prevalent , debilitating , poorly understood condition contributes impair function increase health care utilization . The vast majority CFS patient complain unrelenting sleep disturbance ( e.g. , sleep onset insomnia and/or sleep maintenance insomnia ) could exacerbate symptom fatigue , mood disturbance , reduce quality life . Research normal sleeper insomnia sufferer demonstrate sleep disruption adversely affect system hypothesize important CFS ( e.g. , neuroendocrine autonomic system ) . Insomnia appear perpetuate factor CFS , insomnia appear develop comorbid condition interacts worsen CFS . Perhaps insomnia CFS patient traditionally view secondary symptom rather comorbid disorder , sleep-specific treatment need CFS patient largely ignore . In fact , study conduct test sleep-focused therapy CFS patient . Both clinical observation preliminary study suggest CFS display sleep target ( i.e. , increased time-in-bed , decrease daytime activity ) common Primary comorbid insomnia . These phenomenon know perpetuate sleep problem , likely account chronic insomnia among CFS patient . Given high prevalence cost associate CFS , well complex clinical picture , intervention directly address perpetuate mechanism would likely improve sleep general prognosis patient . The propose randomized clinical trial allow u test effect CBT Insomnia sleep wake function among CFS patient . Positive result could lead enhanced CFS outcome treat comorbid insomnia effectively . The consent form study provide participant information provide care study , purpose study , number participant expect study , require participant study , information random assignment study group , long participation study last , risk associate study , possible benefit participation , alternative treatment participation study , information confidentiality , cost participant associate study , compensation participation , contact question study injury relate study , right stop participate withdraw study .</detailed_description>
