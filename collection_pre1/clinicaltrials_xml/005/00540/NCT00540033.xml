	<brief_summary>We investigate efficacy probiotic reduce incidence severity necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) low birth weight ( VLBW ) infants.A prospective , mask , multi-center randomize control trial conduct level III neonatal center evaluate beneficial effect probiotic NEC among VLBW ( &lt; 1500 g ) infant . VLBW infant start fee enterally eligible randomize 2 group parental informed consent obtain . Infants study group feed Infloran ( Lactobacillus acidophilus Bifidobacterium bifidus ) breast formula milk twice daily 6 week . Infants control group feed breast formula milk alone . The clinician care infant blind group assignment . The primary outcome measurement death NEC ( ≧stage 2 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction NEC worldwide problem preterm low birth weight ( VLBW ) infants highly variable incidence affect 2.6 % 28 % infant ; 1.2.Recent report suggest increase occurrence NEC , estimate 9000 case NEC United States every year , death occur 20 % 40 % affected individual . [ 1.3 ] As number low-birth-weight infant increase , NEC remain critical eminent problem . 3 [ 4 ] The pathogenesis NEC unknown , widely consider multi-factorial disease ; prematurity , enteral feeding , intestinal hypoxia-ischemia , bacterial colonization consider major risk factor . [ 4 ] Researches show proinflammatory cytokine , interleukin-1.6.8 . ( IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 ) tumor necrosis factor- ( TNF- ) 5-711-13 anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 transform growth factor- ( TGF- ) 8-1014-16 intestinal epithelial cell highly relevant involve final common pathway pathogen NEC.5-10 11-16.In mature bowel , intestinal environment capable produce array cytokine important development control inflammatory responses11 8 . In contrast , immaturity neonatal intestinal immune system evidence decreased number immune cell 12.13 9.10 . Recently , bee think inappropriate , accentuate inflammatory response colonize pathogenic flora premature gut play major role , inflammatory cascade promotes spread bacteria toxin , end ischemia , necrosis even perforation . 14-1617.18.19 We Bin-Nun prove probitics reduces incidence severity necrotizing enterocolitis preterm VLBW infant . 17.18 Nevertheless , solid data literature optimum strain , timing , dosage duration probiotic administer preterm VLBW infant preset ; need investigate . Bifidobacteria lactobacilli commonly find breast-fed infant ; 19 NEC VLBW infant occur 6-8 week age ; 20 therefore , hypothesize early oral probiotic contains Bifidobacteria lactobacilli fed preterm VLBW infant 6 week could reduce incidence severity NEC . PATIENTS AND METHODS From July 1 , 2005 Dec 31 , 2006 , prospective mask randomize control trial conduct level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) eight neonatal center Taiwan . Study approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) hospital . Preterm VLBW infant ( birth weight &lt; 1500 gm ) enterally feed eligible trial . They randomize study control group random number table sequence inform parental consent obtain . The allocation contain opaque sequentially number sealed envelope . Preterm VLBW infant severe asphyxia ( stage III ) , fetal chromosome anomaly , fetal cyanotic congenital heart disease , congenital intestine atresia , gastroschisis omphalocele exclude . The clinician provide care infant blind group . Investigators involve care infant . Study group feed infloran ( Lactobacillus acidophilus Bifidobacterium bifidus , Swiss Serum Vaccine Institute Berne , Switzerland ) 125mg/kg/dose ( CFU 109 ) twice daily breast milk 6 week ; control group feed breast milk alone . Infloran store refrigerator tempreture 2 -80 C mix breast milk feeding . Breast milk either infant 's mother 's milk breast milk bank . Both breast milk study control group prepare breast milk team involve care infant follow order seal envelop . Feeding start infant*s vital sign stable , active bowel movement , without abdominal distension , without bile blood nasogastric tube , umbilical artery umbilical venous catheter place least 24 hour . A strict feeding protocol follow study infant . Depending birth weight gestational age , certain amount breast milk initiate infant tolerate one trial distil water . On first day , 1 mL/kg - distilled water give twice , follow breast milk . The amount feed advanced slowly tolerate , 20 mL/kg/day increment per feed . An oral intake 100 mL/kg/d define complete enteral feeding . Feeding stop sign feed intolerance , define presence gastric aspirate amount half previous feeding , twice , abdominal distension . Infants weigh 1,000gm received total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) half calorie supply oral route . The attend physician charge care infant hospital stay . The resident rotate NICU provide care follow establish protocol unit . Definition prenatal steroid , small gestational age , prolonged rupture amniotic membrane , chorioamnionitis , asphyxia , respiratory distress syndrome , patent ductus arteriosus , intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) , sepsis ; indication surfactant indomethacin describe previous study . [ 16 ] There modification management protocol , clinical practice , equipment , infrastructure , element unit study period , protocol get consensus eight center several discussion . NEC classify modify Bell 's classification . 21 [ 39 ] The final determination diagnosis NEC ( ≧ stage2 ) make two independent attend physician know group assignment infant . Demographic clinical variable potential risk factor NEC prospectively abstract medical record . These factor include chorioamnionitis , prolonged rupture amniotic membrane ( PROM ) &gt; 18 hour , pre-eclampsia , use prenatal steroid , multiple -pregnancy , mode delivery , gender , gestational age , birth weight , small gestational age , Apgar score 5 minute , asphyxia , initial Hb , initial body temperature , use surfactant , use indomethacin , dosage indomethacin , day UAC UVC , day fasting , use dopamine , day antibiotic use , day dopamine use , incidence grade IVH , incidence pneumothorax , day mechanical ventilation oxygen supplement , day TPN NEC ; weight gain per week , lengthy stay prospectively abstract medical record . Primary outcome measurement incidence severity NEC ( ≧ stage2 ) ; death . Secondary outcome , culture prove sepsis , chronic lung disease , periventricular leukomalacia ( PVL ) , weight gain per week , duration TPN , lengthy stay , cost effective analysis . SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION AND STATISTICS According unpublished data Premature Baby Foundation Taiwan Bravura National Health Insurance ( 2003-2004 ) , recent data show combined incidence NEC ( ≧stage 2 ) death preterm VLBW infants 25 % level III neonatal center Taiwan . Setting α error 0.05 β error 0.1 ; absolute reduction incidence NEC death 50 % , number need verify hypothesis 203 arm .</detailed_description>
