	<brief_summary>Malignant glioma , include Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , common aggressive type brain cancer , account approximately 60 % primary brain tumor . These tumor characterize diverse molecular abnormality ( within tumor ) , , along difficulty many standard chemotherapy cross blood barrier , contribute poor response therapy poor survival . We recently show Dichloroacetate ( DCA , inhibitor mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase ) able depolarize cancer ( normal ) mitochondrion induce apoptosis cancer normal tissue . We believe alter metabolism cancer like glioblastoma ( DCA switch metabolism cytoplasmic glycolysis mitochondrial glucose oxidation ) inhibit resistance apoptosis characterize cancer . Because metabolism ( i.e . glycolysis ) end result many diverse molecular pathway , effect DCA might positive cancer diverse molecular background . DCA also small molecule readily cross blood brain barrier . Therefore hypothesize DCA effective relative non-toxic potential therapy malignant glioma . We conduct phase II trial 2 parallel arm : ) patient newly diagnose malignant glioma b ) patient recurrent gliomas glioma fail standard therapy ( include surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy ) . All patient need histological diagnosis . DCA give orally patient follow minimum 6 month . The tumor size follow standard MRI CT criterion glucose uptake ( direct effect DCA tumor ) measure FDG-PET imaging . Several clinical parameter quality life follow . Potential toxicity ( particularly peripheral neuropathy ) closely follow dose-de-escalation protocol place case toxicity . In addition , escape protocol application standard therapy ( appropriate ) place patient evidence response DCA . In vitro study perform tissue obtain time surgery ( appropriate ) correlate prospectively clinical data . There limited ability accept patient outside Alberta ; part visit test schedule intense , require residence Edmonton least 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm intracranial malignant glioma / GBM tumor . All patient enrol must measurable without evaluable disease , define Section 11 . In recurrent malignant glioma cohort patient , four week must elapse prior chemotherapy radiation therapy . Age 18 year . ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) performance status Grade 02 ( Karnofsky &gt; 70 ) . Life expectancy great 12 week . Patients must liver , kidney marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL hemoglobin &gt; 90 g/L platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 1.5 X ULN creatinine &lt; 1.5 X ULN Recovery baseline , , grade 1 drugrelated toxicity due prior chemotherapy , radiation , molecular target therapy , except alopecia . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( e.g . : hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Patients must able understand willing sign write informed consent document . Exclusion Criteria Patients chemotherapy , molecular target therapy , radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients new onset increase dose regimen steroid week prior enrollment . Patients receive investigational therapy . Patients grade 2 high peripheral neuropathy due prior medical condition ( multiple sclerosis , diabetes etc ) , medication ( chemotherapy ) , etiology . Greater 0.8 cm brain midline shift CT scan MRI Any psychological , familial , sociological , geographical condition permit medical followup compliance study protocol . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , uncontrolled diabetes history significant hypoglycemic episode past 3 month psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction DCA . In addition , patient increase risk lethal ( time intracranial ) infection treat potentially marrowsuppressive therapy . History malabsorption syndrome substantial amount small bowel stomach resection obstruction may impair absorption DCA .</criteria>
