	<brief_title>Gossypol Treating Patients With Progressive Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate overall survival rate associate AT-101 treat adult patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess estimate acute late toxicity . II . Tumor response rate . III . To estimate 6-month progression free survival . IV . To explore association clinical outcome ( overall survival ) among change potential serum biomarkers , baseline tumor protein expression gene methylation status . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral R- ( - ) -gossypol daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo tumor tissue blood sample collection baseline periodically study biomarker correlative study . Archived tumor tissue sample , available , analyzed Bcl-2 family protein expression ( e.g. , Bcl-2 , Bcl-xL , MCl-1 , Bax , Bak , BH3 domain BH3 member ) MGMT gene methylation status . Blood sample analyze apoptotic protein level ( Bcl-2 ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
