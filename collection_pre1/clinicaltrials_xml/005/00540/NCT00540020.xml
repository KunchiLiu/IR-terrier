	<brief_summary>Context : Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) common condition associate significant long-term cognitive , behavioral , functional morbidity . There minimal control efficacy data various acute rehabilitation intervention approach . Objective : To determine relative efficacy two different acute TBI rehabilitation approach - cognitive-didactic versus functional-experiential . Secondarily determine relative efficacy different patient subpopulation base baseline cognitive functioning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A randomly assign , intent-to-treat model two different comprehensive treatment program conduct July 19 1996 May 16 , 2003 360 adult participant moderate severe TBI treat four participate Veterans Administration TBI rehabilitation center . All patient admit Commission Accreditation Rehabilitation Facilities ( CARF ) accredit acute inpatient rehabilitation brain injury program 4 participate Veterans Administration Medical Centers ( VAMCs ) ( Minneapolis , Palo Alto , Richmond , Tampa ) study enrollment period screen eligibility . The design randomized-controlled trial two treatment arm ( cognitive-didactic functional-experiential ) , embed within interdisciplinary TBI rehabilitation program . All treatment hospital base . The interactive nature experimental condition preclude subject blinding . Since participate site serf wide geographic area , protocol permit post-hospital outcome assessment structure telephonic interview , minimize drop . Participants complete baseline assessment receive random assignment one two standardize protocol rehabilitation program ( summarize describe detail elsewhere ) . Participants receive 1.5 2.5 hour daily protocol-specific therapy plus another 2 2.5 hour daily occupational physical therapy . Independent teams therapist function site deliver separate treatment necessity blind treatment . Protocol monitor site visit , biweekly conference call , biannual investigator meeting conduct ensure uniformity protocol treatment time .</detailed_description>
