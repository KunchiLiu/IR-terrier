	<brief_summary>Approximately twelve percent woman United States develop breast cancer , common form cancer affect woman , 183,000 new case project 1995 . Despite increase incidence , age-adjusted death rate carcinoma remain relatively stable . Although reason yet demonstrate , stability may direct consequence early detection improve therapy . Screening mammography early detection technique show reduce mortality 23 % . Mammographic abnormality go biopsy show 24 % positive malignancy great variability ( 6-75 % ) . Breast biopsy expensive procedure risk anesthesia surgery may obviate specific non-invasive testing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurements Breast Tissue Optical Properties</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging new method quantitative characterization optical property tissue . The diagnostic tool utilize anomaly transmission diffuse near infra-red light rapid detection oxygenate deoxygenated hemoglobin , near infra-red absorb drug level , blood volume change , scatter property tissue . Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging measurement breast tissue optical property probe similar shape ultrasound probe . The imaging measurement different area breast include diseased location normal area . Optical measurement guide co-registered ultrasound measurement purpose determine lesion size location . Each measurement require 5-60 second record data calculate optical property . The process repeat adequate number measurement perform measurement take 30 90 minute . The researcher determine breast optical property demographic information , age menopausal status well medical history .</detailed_description>
