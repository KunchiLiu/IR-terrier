	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 . To evaluate efficacy safety low-dose versus standard-dose ribavirin combination peginterferon alfa-2a give 16 week hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) genotype 2 infected , treatment-na誰ve chronic hepatitis C patient achieve rapid virologic response ( RVR , define seronegativity HCV RNA week 4 treatment ) . 2 . To evaluate efficacy safety 24-week versus 48-week regimen peginterferon alfa-2a plus standard-dose ribavirin HCV genotype 2 infect , treatment-na誰ve chronic hepatitis C patient RVR .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Four Arms , Multicenter Study Tailored Regimens With Peginterferon Plus Ribavirin Genotype 2 Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recommended regimen treat HCV genotype 2 patient peginterferon plus low dose ribavirin ( 800 mg/day ) 24 week . Recently study demonstrate short treatment duration 12-16 week peginterferon plus standard weight-based dose ribavirin ( 800-1400 mg/day ) effective 24-week regimen among HCV genotype 2 patient RVR week 4 treatment ( rate sustain virological response , SVR , approximately 90 % ) . However , patient without RVR week 4 efficacy 24 week treatment remain unsatisfied . Individualized therapy tailor regimen accord baseline on-treatment virological factor , without compromise efficacy , future strategy management chronic hepatitis C. The aim present study 1 . To evaluate efficacy safety low-dose versus standard-dose ribavirin combination peginterferon alfa-2a give 16 week hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) genotype 2 infected , treatment-na誰ve chronic hepatitis C patient achieve rapid virologic response ( RVR , define seronegativity HCV RNA week 4 treatment ) . 2 . To evaluate efficacy safety 24-week versus 48-week regimen peginterferon alfa-2a plus standard-dose ribavirin HCV genotype 2 infect , treatment-na誰ve chronic hepatitis C patient RVR .</detailed_description>
