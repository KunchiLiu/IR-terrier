	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Giving chemotherapy drug , busulfan etoposide , intensity-modulated radiation therapy donor stem cell transplant help stop growth cancer cell . It also help stop patient 's immune system reject donor 's stem cell . When healthy stem cell donor infused patient may help patient 's bone marrow make stem cell , red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . Sometimes transplanted cell donor make immune response body 's normal cell . Giving intensity-modulated radiation therapy together busulfan etoposide transplant may stop happen . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose intensity-modulated radiation therapy give together busulfan etoposide follow donor stem cell transplant see well work treat patient advanced myeloid cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) large field image-guided IMRT , use helical tomotherapy , give combination IV busulfan VP-16 preparative regimen allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) HLA-identical sibling patient advanced myeloid malignancy . ( Phase I ) II . To describe toxicity dose level study . ( Phase I ) III . To estimate radiation dos whole body , normal organ , bone marrow serial image study follow administration IMRT . ( Phase I ) IV . To estimate overall survival probability , disease-free survival probability , relapse rate associate preparative regimen . ( Phase II ) V. To characterize treatment related mortality toxicity profile ( early/late ) associate regimen . ( Phase II ) VI . To descriptively compare outcomes patient treat protocol comparable patient population condition whole-body radiotherapy . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study intensity-modulated radiation therapy follow phase II study . PREPARATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive busulfan IV daily 2 hour day -15 -13 every 6 hour day -12 -9 . Patients also receive etoposide IV day -3 . Patients undergo image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy use helical tomotherapy day -8 -5 . TRANSPLANTATION : Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation bone marrow transplantation day 0 . GRAFT-VS-HOST DISEASE ( GVHD ) PROPHYLAXIS : Patients receive GVHD prophylaxis excludes methotrexate . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 1 year annually 2 year thereafter .</detailed_description>
