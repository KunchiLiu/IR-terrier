	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Relapsed Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) , uncommon significant subtype lymphoma , divide classical HL ( cHL ) nodular lymphocyte predominant HL ( NLPHL ) . Progress make cHL therapy result 5-year failure free survival rate 61 % -89 % even set advanced stage bulky disease . Patients relapse however , variable prognosis range 8-year overall survival rate le 8 % patient never achieve remission 54 % patient complete remission last great 12 month . High dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell support standard care patient relapse cHL relapse despite aggressive salvage therapy 20 - 50 % , median remission duration approximately 6 month . Furthermore , subset relapse HL patient may candidate aggressive salvage regimen . These novel salvage therapy need relapsed/refractory cHL , especially agent without serious late toxicity particularly attractive disease . Advances understand HL pathogenesis lenalidomide 's mechanisms action provide substantial rationale evaluate lenalidomide HL patient .</detailed_description>
