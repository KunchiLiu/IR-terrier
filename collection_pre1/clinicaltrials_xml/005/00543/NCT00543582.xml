	<brief_summary>The first part study evaluate determine three different form MGCD0103 ( free base FB-MGCD0103 , tartaric acid free base [ TA-FB-MGCD0103 ] , dihydrobromide [ 2HBr ] salt formulation MGCD0103 ) property give patient cancer . The second part study determine whether MGCD0103 administer combination azacitidine effective safe treat subject relapse refractory Hodgkin 's lymphoma non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) ( follicular diffuse large B-cell [ DLBCL ] ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MGCD0103 Administered Combination With Azacitidine ( Vidaza® ) Subjects With Relapsed Refractory Hodgkin Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MGCD0103 FB-MGCD0103 belong class drug know histone deacetylase inhibitor ( also call HDAC inhibitor ) . Azacitidine belong class anti-cancer drug know DNA de-methylating agent . Azacitidine ( Vidaza® ) approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) 2004 treatment myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . The combination MGCD0103 azacitidine give 50 people leukemia MDS clinical study . This first study combination test people lymphoma . Specifically , study design understand follow : - How long single dos TA-FB-MGCD0103 , FB-MGCD0103 MGCD0103 stay body , OR - How long different dos TA-FB-MGCD0103 FB-MGCD0103 stay body ; - How long MGCD0103 stay body give azacitidine ; - What effect MGCD0103 azacitidine body study subject 's type lymphoma ; - If genetic chemical make-up study subject 's blood and/or tumor play role she/he respond respond MGCD0103 azacitidine .</detailed_description>
