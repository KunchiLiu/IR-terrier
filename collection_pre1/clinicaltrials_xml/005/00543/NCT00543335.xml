	<brief_title>Sorafenib Thoracic Radiation Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Sorafenib design block function important protein cancer cell . These protein , active , part responsible growth behavior cancer cell . Study Drug Dose Escalation : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 4 group 3-6 participant enrol Phase I portion study . Enrolled Phase I portion , dose sorafenib receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level sorafenib . Each new group receive high dose sorafenib group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose sorafenib find . All participant receive type amount radiation . Study Drug Administration : You take sorafenib capsule 1-2 time every day begin Day 1 radiation therapy . If first group study , take study drug 1 time . If group , take study drug 2 time day . You take study drug without food ( 1 hour 2 hour eat ) . Radiation Therapy : Before receive radiation therapy , `` mark session '' . At visit , compute tomography ( CT ) scan use help plan radiation therapy . This take 45 minute . Before receive radiation , also single photon compute tomography ( SPECT ) scan lung . You give 15 radiation treatment , day , 5 day week , Monday-Friday . Each treatment take 30 minute . You sign separate consent form radiation therapy procedure describe detail . Clinical Visits : You routine clinical visit every week receive radiation therapy . The information collect clinical visit use study . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement blood pressure weight . - You ask side effect may experience new drug may take . - You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status evaluation ) - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You test doctor feel medically necessary Urine collect every week take sorafenib receive radiation therapy routine test . Length Study : You remain study 6 week complete radiation therapy . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . End-of-Study Visit : You end-of-study visit 4-6 week stop receive radiation . At visit , CT scan check status disease . Follow-Up Visits : Your first follow-up visit 6 week ( +/- 7 day ) radiation therapy second follow-up appointment 10 week ( +/- 7 day ) radiation therapy . You follow visit every 3 month . At visit , go though following : - Your complete medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight blood pressure . - You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status evaluation ) . - You ask drug may take . - Blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You also chest x-ray . - You compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest area . - The location , type , size measurable lesion record . - If doctor think necessary , positron emission tomography ( PET ) /CT scan . - If doctor think necessary , electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) . - You may lung perfusion scan see region lung equally functional . This call lung SPECT scan . - You lung functional test ( PFT ) doctor think necessary . All test routine examination would without participate study order know status disease . This investigational study . Sorafenib FDA approve commercially available renal cell carcinoma . The radiation therapy schedule use study standard treatment lung cancer patient . The use sorafenib radiation therapy investigational . Up 64 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
