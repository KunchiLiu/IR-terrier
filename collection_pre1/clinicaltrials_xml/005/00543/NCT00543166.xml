	<detailed_description>We hypothesize , due Sjögren 's syndrome ( SS ) disease characteristic , primary target hit disease process secretory acinar cell cell particularly woman damage due insufficient support , normally provide dehydroepiandrosterone intracrine processing . Dehydroepiandrosterone deficiency time adrenopause seem u likely endocrine trigger estrogen deficiency cause menopause androgens general consider protective autoimmunity estrogens favor . Acinar cell normally responsible production primary saliva . Acinar cell damage lead acinar cell apoptosis loss . Normally compensated division acinar cell situ , accord recent report , perhaps rather division subsequent migration one daughter cell acinar space transdifferentiation intercalate ductal cell progenitor mature acinar cell . In SS remodel seem impaired , perhaps reason , also lead primary acinar cell damage . According hypothesis , primary change occur salivary gland specifically acinar cell , whereas immune activation autoimmunity secondarily activate abnormally damage acinar cell individual `` right '' genetic background also produce SS-A SS-B antibody . The cause acinar cell damage may direct , damage stimulus , e.g . virus infection irradiation damage , rather lack support anabolic stimulus inadequate maintenance acinar cell health lead cytopathic acinar cell change . In peri-menopausal woman ( still produce estrogen ) abnormal antigen release processing acinar cell , reveals cryptic epitope , together autoimmunity enhance effect estrogen , may lead full picture SS ( Cutolo et al. , 2004 ) . This neuroimmunoendocrine working hypothesis would explain many central disease characteristic , provide final answer mystery intriguing syndrome reason insufficient production generation DHEA remain solved . We do preliminary study analyze topic mapping signal extracellular matrix adrenal cortex , cell proliferate outer zone subsequently migrate centripetal direction , phenotypic transition occur out zone ( zona glomerulosa ) cell produce aldosterone intermediate zone ( zona fasciculata ) cell produce glucocorticosteroids finally inner zone ( zona reticularis ) cell produce DHEA . However , research project decide totally focus salivary gland acinar cell-sex steroid interaction .</detailed_description>
