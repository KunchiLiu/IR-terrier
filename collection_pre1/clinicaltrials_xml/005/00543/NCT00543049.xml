	<brief_summary>Ovarian cancer often recognize advanced clinical state , initial therapeutic strategy consist platinum contain chemotherapy subsequent primary surgery . Although initially responsive platinum-paclitaxel containing chemotherapy , significant number patient show tumor progression first line chemotherapy relapse within six month completion first line chemotherapy , therefore characterize chemotherapy resistant . Any second line chemotherapy result approximately 10 % overall response , underline poor prognosis patient estimate median overall survival 20 week . In addition conventional chemotherapeutics , call small molecule high interest establish new strategy chemotherapy-refractory ovarian cancer ( long run first line chemotherapy ) . SU11248 polytargeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor . SU11248 demonstrate clinical efficacy kidney cancer GIST , clinical trial initiate tumor entity . Growth pattern biological target present ovarian cancer indicate SU11248 might promise compound treatment ovarian cancer . Especially , VEGFR , PDGFR c-kit specific target SU11248 , express ovarian cancer . The different target SU11248 provide potential advantage compound compare single-target molecule chemotherapy-refractory ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Multicenter Trial With SU11248 Evaluating Dosage , Tolerability , Toxicity Effectiveness Multitargeted Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study patient ovarian cancer refractory platinum base chemotherapy design randomize , 2-schedule dose-level , open-label , multicenter phase II study select good dose schedule arm investigation . 72 patient randomize 1:1 ratio receive oral SU11248 therapy either 37.5 mg/day continuously 50mg/day 4 week follow 14 day . Patients get outpatient treatment . At screen patient ' eligibility assess , baseline demographic characteristic obtain , baseline value effect variable collect . Patients measurable lesion well non-measurable disease include trial . Measurable lesion document CT MRI scan CA-125 value , non-measurable lesion monitor analysis CA°125 level . The patient ' safety monitor 30 day termination SU11248 therapy . In patient measurable lesion baseline , ( post ) -treatment value effect accord RECIST criterion collect show table 6 . In case CR PR , confirmatory CT MRI scan require interval least four week . Antitumor effect accord CA°125 level determine time interval , addition , 28 day last SU11248 application patient CA°125 response accord GCIG guideline therapy . For post study follow-up , patient and/or physician contact via phone overall survival TTP ( include method diagnosis additional treatment ) every 2 month life time .</detailed_description>
