	<brief_summary>The primary objective trial determine rate pathologically complete remission follow preoperative dose-intensified therapy doxorubicin docetaxel without tamoxifen patient operable carcinoma breast . Secondary aim assess rate clinical complete partial response , breast-conserving operation , toxicity chemotherapy without tamoxifen . Women meet follow criterion eligible study : operable breast cancer ( T³3cm N0-2 M0 ) , histologically confirm diagnosis core-cut needle incisional biopsy , measurable disease mammography sonography breast MRI ( best appropriate method choose investigator ) . After patient give write informed consent , randomise study treatment . All patient schedule receive 4 cycle combination chemotherapy consist doxorubicin 50 mg/m² ( 15-min i.v . infusion ) docetaxel 75 mg/m² ( 1-h i.v . infusion ) . The patient allocate group I additionally receive oral dos tamoxifen 30 mg daily , start first day chemotherapy , chemotherapy alone administered patient group II . Cycles repeat every 14 day , follow surgery 8 week initiation trial . Surgery consist removal remain tumour ( breastconserving resection mastectomy ) axillary dissection . Patients response even progression primary tumour treat discretion investigator follow accord protocol . If partial complete tumour response achieve , radiotherapy give remain breast patient undergo breast conserving therapy , tamoxifen treatment continue 5 year . Response assess 4th cycle surgery , use best appropriate method . Clinical evaluation perform cycle . It plan recruite 200 patient period 1 year .</brief_summary>
