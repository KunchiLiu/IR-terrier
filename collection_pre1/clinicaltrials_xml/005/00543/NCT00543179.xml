	<brief_summary>Background Somatostatin octreotide LAR ( long-acting analogue ) exert number inhibitory effect : gut hormone , also gastro-intestinal secretion motility . Somatostatin analogue effective prevent symptom sign early late dump demonstrate previously . However , octreotide LAR cause gastrointestinal side effect injection solution difficult prepare . Recently , new somatostatin analogue prolong release formulation , Lanreotide autogel ( L-autogel ) , become available . It viscous aqueous gel , compose solely water lanreotide . Deep subcutaneous administration may lead increase treatment acceptance compare intramuscular depot preparation . It easy prepare though cause le local side effect technical problem octreotide LAR . Recent study do measure efficacy safety L-autogel acromegalic treat previously octreotide LAR . These study show L-autogel effective well-tolerated patient , equivalent good disease control less gastrointestinal adverse event . Until , data available effectivety L-autogel patient dump syndrome . Therefore , study aim establish effectiveness tolerability L-autogel patient dump syndrome , previously treat octreotide LAR .</brief_summary>
