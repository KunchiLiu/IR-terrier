	<brief_title>Single Ascending Dose GAP-134 24-Hour IV Infusion Healthy Japanese Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) commonly occur sustain arrhythmia clinical practice . AF serious disorder associate increase risk stroke , morbidity mortality , number patient estimate double within next 4 decade . The currently available antiarrhythmic drug limit efficacy associate serious side effect potentially lethal ventricular proarrhythmias one major concern . Thus , large unmet clinical need efficacious safe antiarrhythmic drug treatment AF . The classical orientation antiarrhythmic therapy modulate cardiac ion channel ( sodium , potassium calcium ) autonomic nervous system . However , numerous experimental clinical study suggest cardiac conduction slow impaired gap junction intercellular communication ( GJIC ) important pathogenesis cardiac arrhythmia , include AF . General conduction slow presence small islands intra-atrial conduction block result decrease gap junction conductance , alter gap junction expression heterogeneous spatial distribution gap junction may provide turn point multiple wave , thereby promote re-entry impulse . In recognition , several author propose gap junction modulation potential new target treatment AF . GAP-134 antiarrhythmic dipeptide demonstrate vitro vivo efficacy mouse dog model arrhythmia . GAP-134 apparent proarrhythmic activity hemodynamic compromise show significant binding panel &gt; 60 different receptor ion channel . If determine safe effective indication seek GAP-134 prevention post operative atrial fibrillation .</detailed_description>
