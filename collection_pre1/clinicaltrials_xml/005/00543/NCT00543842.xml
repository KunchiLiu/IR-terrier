	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose bevacizumab ( Avastin ) erlotinib hydrochloride ( Tarceva ) give combination standard radiation therapy capecitabine surgery patient rectal cancer . The safety effectiveness combination therapy also study . The goal Phase I trial determine maximal tolerate dose ( MTD ) concurrent capecitabine , bevacizumab erlotinib preoperative radiation therapy ( RT ) rectal cancer .

	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Bevacizumab design prevent slow growth cancer cell block growth blood vessel . Erlotinib hydrochloride design block activity protein find surface many tumor cell may control tumor growth survival . This may stop tumor grow . Capecitabine design interfere growth cancer cell . Study Phases : The study 2 part , call Phase I Phase II . In Phase I portion , participant treat 1 4 dose combination capecitabine , bevacizumab , erlotinib hydrochloride , along radiation therapy . The dose level capecitabine erlotinib hydrochloride change Phase I , dose level bevacizumab radiation therapy participant . The first group participant give low dose combination . If group experience intolerable side effect , next group participant enrol high dose level . This continue high tolerable dose level study drug radiation therapy combination find ( call maximum tolerate dose , MTD ) . Based result Phase I , researcher decide MTD level chemotherapy radiation therapy . In Phase II , participant treat MTD dose level . Up 26 participant treated phase . Radiation Chemotherapy Administration : If find eligible take part study , begin radiation therapy . The radiation therapy give day 5 day row ( Monday-Friday ) week , 5 week 3 day . You total 28 radiation treatment . Each radiation treatment take 30 minute . You take chemotherapy drug capecitabine mouth twice day tablet day receive radiation therapy . These pill take Saturday Sunday . You must take drug cimetidine , must coumadin least 1 week sorivudine brivudine least 4 week start capecitabine entire capecitabine therapy . If able stop take coumadin , need extra blood test perform throughout study check bleed clot speed . You receive drug bevacizumab vein every 2 week 6 week ( total 3 dos ) . The infusion first last 90 minute . If allergic reaction , fever , chill first infusion , infusion time second dose shorten 60 minute . If allergic reaction side effect second drug infusion , last infusion bevacizumab give 30 minute . If reaction infusion , may receive extra preventive medication infusion , length time may need stay 90 minute . You take chemotherapy drug erlotinib hydrochloride mouth tablet day . Your doctor tell whether take erlotinib hydrochloride first 3 week radiation therapy , whole time get radiation therapy , 6 week . Study Tests During study , follow test perform : - You physical exam week . - Every week , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You routine urine test first third week radiation therapy . - The possible development side effect closely monitor weekly visit doctor . At 6-8 week stop receive radiotherapy , physical exam , routine blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) , urine test . Surgery : At least 8 week stop receive radiotherapy , rectal tumor remove surgery . This consider standard care sign separate surgical consent document . Length Study : You receive radiation therapy capecitabine , bevacizumab , erlotinib hydrochloride 5 Â½ 6 week . At least 8 week stop receive radiotherapy , surgery . You may receive additional chemotherapy . You may take study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . Follow-up Testing : After surgery possible chemotherapy surgery , see doctor every 3-4 month 1 year , every 6 month next 3 year . You blood test doctor visit . You also CT scan within 4-6 month completion chemotherapy every 6 month first 3 year , year next 2 year . These test standard care procedure treatment colorectal cancer . This investigational study . Capecitabine bevacizumab approve FDA treatment metastatic colorectal cancer . Erlotinib hydrochloride approve FDA treatment pancreatic cancer , colorectal cancer . The combination capecitabine , erlotinib bevacizumab radiation therapy approve FDA . At time , combination use research . Update : Nineteen participant enrol MD Anderson Phase I portion study study complete December 2013 .</detailed_description>
