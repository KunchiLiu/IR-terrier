	<brief_summary>The purpose study quantify brain distribution nicotinic receptor human volunteer alteration patient suffer neurological disease Parkinson Alzheimer diseases familial epilepsy . This do use Postron Emission Tomography ( PET ) new radiotracer nicotinic receptor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET Study Nicotinic Receptors Human</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PET non -invasive technique allow study , vivo human , neurotransmission system . Thanks development radiotracers selective bind site neurotransmitter , several system study dopaminergic , GABAergic system . However , vivo study cholinergic system , hamper lack suitable radiotracer . The cholinergic system important neurotransmitter system human brain exact rule remain unclear . It involve cognition , memory alter early several neurodegeneratives disease Parkinson Alzheimer disease . The nicotinic receptor one target cholinergic neurotransmission ( together muscarinic receptor ) , importance since postmortem study show early alteration neurodegeneratives disease . Moreover , locate mostly presynaptic part cholinergic termination , label great interest study integrity cholinergic fibre . Post-mortem study show reduction nicotinic receptor density Alzheimer 's disease temporal cortex hippocampus . Similarly , Parkinson 's disease , nicotinic receptor density show reduced fronto-temporal cortex pedoculo-pontin nucleus . Recently , point mutation nicotinic receptor sub-units ( alpha4 beta2 ) objectived familial epilepsy : Autosomic Dominant Noctural Frontal Lobe Epilepsy ( ADNFLE ) . Nicotinic receptor also involve tobacco addiction , main brain target nicotine cigarette smoking . Human post-mortem study animal model suggest nicotinic receptor density increase chronic smoker . The vivo study receptor bring new insight understand physiopathology nicotinic receptor several neurodegeneratives disease . The radioligand use the2- F-A-85380 label fluorin-18 , fluoro derivative A85380 ( Abbott compound ) . The 2-F-A-85380 present high affinity high selectivity alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor subtype , major nicotinic receptor subtype brain . Radiolabelling , fluorin-18 ( half-life=110 min ) perform laboratory , allow produciton high specific activity . This compound study extensively rodent monkey use PET . The low toxicity compound allow use radiotracer human . Subject 18 85 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , psychological assessment , blood urine test . Subjects enrol study participate one follow procedure : Part 1 : Quantification normal non-smoker smoker subject : Two catheter ( small plastic tube ) place vein subject 's arm inject [ 18F ] FA85380 collect blood sample scan . A third catheter place wrist artery obtain arterial blood scan . With catheter place , subject lie scanner bed head place special mask limit movement brain scan . The scan begin initial transmission scan measure tissue attenuation 15 minute , [ 18F ] FA85380 inject actual PET scan start . The entire procedure take 4 hour , include 2.5 hour continuous scan session , subject require lie still . The second scan period start one hour rest period subject relax scanner , last 30 minute . They monitor throughout procedure . Vital sign measure electrocardiogram take injection tracer . At end scanning , additional blood urine sample collect . Subjects ask urinate scanning session lessen radioactivity body . Part 2 Parkinson disease : The PET scan use [ 18F ] FA85380 Part 1 . A second PET procedure use [ 18F ] FDOPA perform day . Part 3 Alzheimer disease This part study Part 1 , except arterial catheter place . A second PET procedure perform use [ 18F ] FDG . Part 4 Epilepsy ADNFLE This part study Part 3 .</detailed_description>
