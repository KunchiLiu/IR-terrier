	<brief_summary>The primary objective evaluate safety feasibility use M118 anticoagulant target population subject stable coronary artery disease ( CAD ) undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . The secondary objective evaluate effect M118 procedural index include procedure success , abrupt closure , post-procedure TIMI flow , catheter thrombus . Substudy Primary Objective The primary objective substudy characterize pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic profile M118 among subject stable coronary artery disease undergo elective PCI .</brief_summary>
