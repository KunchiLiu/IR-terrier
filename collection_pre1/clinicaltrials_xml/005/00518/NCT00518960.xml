	<brief_title>The Effects ProAlgaZyme HDL Cholesterol Individuals With Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) common cause mortality United States . In 1988 , Reaven , et al . publish finding indicate majority individual develop CVD multiple concurrent risk factor include dyslipidemia , hypertension , hyperglycemia . Reaven , et al. , define cluster risk factor Syndrome X hypothesize insulin resistance underlie factor development . Over time , metabolic syndrome use meaningful term additional risk factor associate diagnosis ( Grundy , et al . 2004 ) . Metabolic syndrome increasingly prevalent problem United States westernize nation . It estimate approximately 50 million Americans metabolic syndrome . The risk factor link metabolic syndrome include : - Abdominal obesity - Atherogenic dyslipidemia ( high triglyceride , low HDL cholesterol high LDL cholesterol ) - Elevated blood pressure - Insulin resistance without glucose intolerance - Pro-thrombotic state ( e.g. , high fibrinogen plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 blood ) - Pro-inflammatory state [ e.g . elevate C-reactive protein ( CRP ) blood ] The management goal metabolic syndrome include reduce risk develop CVD type 2 diabetes . Therefore , therapy direct reduce LDL cholesterol , blood pressure glucose well increase HDL cholesterol level . Additional intervention control blood pressure lipid provide next line treatment patient metabolic syndrome . ProAlgaZyme , novel fermentation product freshwater algae ecosystem , evaluate trial effect circulate lipid . According sponsor , ProAlgaZyme expect increase circulating level HDL cholesterol lower total cholesterol CRP . ProAlgaZyme previously test double blind , placebo control , pilot trial 60 subject metabolic syndrome ( 30 subject per arm ) , conduct University Yaound√© , Cameroon . Statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05 good ) improvement see total cholesterol , HDL-C C-reactive protein compare placebo . ( In Press - Lipids Health Disease ) The present study evaluate effect ProAlgaZyme versus placebo blood lipid hsCRP subject meet criterion Metabolic Syndrome .</detailed_description>
