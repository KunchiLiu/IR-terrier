	<brief_title>A Study Determine Effective Tolerable Titration Scheme OROS-Methylphenidate Children With Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , non-comparative study . Each patient treat 10 week include 6-week titration phase 4-week maintenance phase . After initial baseline evaluation , patient currently receive IR-Methylphenidate ( IR-MPH ) therapy switch receive OROS-methylphenidate daily . Patients receive IR-MPH =15 mg per day switch receive 18 mg daily OROS-methylphenidate . For patient IR-MPH daily dosage &gt; 15 mg =30 mg , initial dose OROS-methylphenidate 36 mg daily . Other patient receive IR-MPH high 30 mg per day , switch receive 54 mg daily OROS-methylphenidate . During 6-week titration phase , patient achieve criterion `` Optimal Response '' titrate biweekly increase next dose level ( 36 mg per day , 54 mg per day ) . The maximum dose OROS-methylphenidate per day 54 mg package insert indicates . However , dose decrease allow clinically intolerable adverse event emerge . At end 6-week titration phase , final titration dose maintain last 4 week trial regardless optimal response . In summary , patient attend bi-weekly clinic visit first 6 week ( visit 2 4 ) monthly clinic visit subsequent 4 week ( visit 5 ) . Patients receive 18 mg 36mg 54 mg daily OROS-methylphenidate 10 week .</detailed_description>
