	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine transplant combination stem cell obtain bone marrow patient contribute formation new blood vessel severely diseased ischemic limb ( leg ) . In study safe use combination stem cell effect make new blood vessel evaluate . Limb Ischemia ( LI ) severe obstruction artery seriously decrease blood flow extremity ( mainly foot leg ) progress point severe pain even skin ulcer sore . LI need comprehensive treatment since condition improve . The overall goal treatment reduce pain increase blood flow improve symptom save leg foot . In many case , current option treatment include medication , surgery endovascular procedure successful . In last year , investigator explore therapy aim increase blood flow ischemic vessel transplant cell promote development new vessel diseased leg . The study hypothesis base concept process formation new blood vessel complex require participation several type stem cell growth factor . The lack component produce vessel immature unable provide appropriate blood supply leg . Patients eligible participate study suffer poor circulation severe leg blockage , candidate surgical procedure . Once mixture stem cell prepare patient 's bone marrow ready , cell transplant calf muscle diseased leg . Clinical study evaluate transplant work safe perform 1 year cell transplant .</brief_summary>
