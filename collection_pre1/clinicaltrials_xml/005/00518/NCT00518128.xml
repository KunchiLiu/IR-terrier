To achieve goal , examine key health-related ( C-reactive protein , homocysteine , leptin , homeostasis model insulin resistance , heart rate variability ) functional ( sleep-related quality life vigilance ) measure among surgical group OSA patient tolerate non-surgical treatment ( positive airway pressure , PAP ) comparison group match OSA patient tolerate PAP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal research improve understand effectiveness surgical OSA treatment evaluate impact health-related functional outcome compare effect change respiratory physiology achieve surgery . To achieve goal , examine key health-related ( C-reactive protein , homocysteine , leptin , homeostasis model insulin resistance , heart rate variability ) functional ( sleep-related quality life vigilance ) measure among surgical group OSA patient tolerate non-surgical treatment ( positive airway pressure , PAP ) comparison group match OSA patient tolerate PAP . We propose measure impact surgical OSA treatment health-related functional outcome measure follow three analysis : ( 1 ) ass change see surgical treatment ; ( 2 ) compare change see surgical PAP treatment ; ( 3 ) evaluate association change respiratory pattern sleep change health-related functional outcome measure surgical PAP treatment .</detailed_description>
