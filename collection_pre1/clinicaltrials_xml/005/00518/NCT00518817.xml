	<brief_summary>This study significant impact muscular dystrophy patient promote early screen heart disease . With early identification , beneficial medical therapy start sooner , result restore maintain normal heart function . This critical survival patient . We report previously heart failure patient may common mechanism , `` final common pathway '' . Heart failure significant health problem 5 million people US carry diagnosis account 12-15 million office visit 6.5 million hospital day per year . The number deaths heart failure continue increase . The data study could impact patient worldwide heart failure offer new insight ever-growing disease population lead significant change currently treat .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective ( ) Hypothesis ( e ) : The objective evaluate follow : Specific Hypothesis # 1 : Heart disease , specifically dilate cardiomyopathy , identify early patient muscular dystrophy allow early institution medical therapy Specific Hypothesis # 2 : Non-invasive test via magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) echocardiography identify early systolic diastolic dysfunction patient muscular dystrophy well document structural change ( `` Reverse remodel '' ) follow institution medical therapy Specific Hypothesis # 3 : Serologic test identify early cardiac dysfunction prior change magnetic resonance image echocardiogram predict disease onset , risk stratify future cardiac morbidity mortality , response medical therapy Specific Hypothesis # 4 : Specific dystrophin mutation identify predict onset protection dilate cardiomyopathy Specific Hypothesis # 5 : Construction maintenance database patient muscular dystrophy establish allow future research patient muscular dystrophy , specifically area gene therapy Specific Hypothesis # 6 : Quality life patient cardiac disease assess used modulate therapy also allow noncardiac direct therapy improve overall well-being Specific Hypothesis # 7 : Further understanding neurohormonal profile , responses medical therapy , dystrophin mediate cardiomyopathy impact patient heart failure world-wide</detailed_description>
