	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy clobazam adjunctive therapy treatment seizure lead drop attack ( drop seizure ) patient 2 60 year age Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome ( LGS ) . Patients enrol approximately 65 site U.S. ex-US 23 week . Patients randomly assign either low , medium high dose , placebo . The study include baseline period , titration period maintenance period .

	<detailed_description>LGS pose significant treatment challenge . No single antiepileptic drug ( AED ) provide satisfactory relief patient LGS combination treatment often require . Even combination therapy , many LGS patient show resistance treatment . Adjunctive therapy newer anticonvulsant medication demonstrate efficacy patient , although polytherapy high medication dos often associate unfavorable adverse event profile . More effective better-tolerated treatment option need population medically intractable epilepsy patient . Clobazam may provide improved safety profile compare AEDs currently approve treatment LGS may less hypotonia drool effect benzodiazepine .</detailed_description>
