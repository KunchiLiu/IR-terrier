	<brief_title>Pilot Study Pyridostigmine Upon Immune Activation HIV-1 Patients Who Have Inadequate Immune Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In HIV-1 infected patient , HAART suppress viral replication , reflect reduced viral load , recovery frequency CD4+ T-cells . The latter associate reduce risk develop opportunistic infectious disease , death . T-cell recovery , however , highly variable within individual , suggest virological eradication one factor . A phenomenon know Immune Discordance well known . It reflect subpopulation -as high 30 % patients- adequate suppression viral replication , CD4+ cell level rise modestly ( safety level ) . In set , patient remain susceptible develop opportunistic infection , disease progression , die . Various mechanism propose , one common factor enhance CD4+-cell activation , lead cell dysfunction apoptosis . It known inflammatory response able activate antiinflammatory cholinergic pathway , acetylcholine ( ACh ) release turn activates nicotinic receptor macrophage . The result diminish synthesis inflammatory cytokine TNF-Î± , IL-1 . We recently show ex-vivo , proof-of-concept study carry HIV-infected subject early phase infection ( require specific treatment ) Pyridostigmine diminish CD4+-cell activation , increase subpopulation regulatory T-cells ( T-reg ) . Pyridostigmine , ACh-esterase inhibitor , show safe population , include healthy Gulf War trooper , patient Myasthenia Gravis . Its hypothetical effect reduce degrade rate naturally occur ACh ( release vagus nerve ) enzyme ACh-esterase . This turn enhance couple nicotinic receptor macrophage , accord previous study ( unpublished data ) , improve T-cell milieu , diminish T-cell activation ( well know trigger apoptosis ) , enhance T-reg proliferation . The purpose study determine whether addition Pyridostigmine Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART ) increase number CD4+ T-cells discordant patient viral load diminishes , T-cell level remain low initiation treatment .</detailed_description>
