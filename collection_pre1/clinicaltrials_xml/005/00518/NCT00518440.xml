	<detailed_description>Although ALF truly orphan disease affect 2,000 person per year , severity , frequency among young adult , high resource utilization justifies attention pay . In addition , ALF capture interest attention researcher unique pathogenesis extreme severity , encourage u understand process underlie form liver injury , focus lethal manifestation . The etiology associate ALF continue change year apparent decline viral hepatitis , remarkable increase acetaminophen toxicity current level ~44-50 % case . A problem study ALF number case specific etiology observe one institution vanishingly small . The early goal ALF Study carefully define etiology ALF national scale , finally allow in-depth study specific ALF cause autoimmune ALF , viral hepatitis Wilson disease ( WD ) . A second group patient worthy study acute liver injury.It would value study patient destine possibly ALF early illness several reason : first , might able well predict progress full liver failure ; second , current definition require encephalopathy limit number patient available study site ; finally , therapeutic trial might great efficacy begin earlier disease stage . Patients enrol referred ALFSG clinical site gastroenterologist/hepatologist fellow . Detailed clinical data bio-specimen ( serum , urine , plasma , DNA tissue available ) collect . Subjects follow long-term 6 month 12 month . Detailed clinical data serum collect .</detailed_description>
