	<brief_summary>LAY SUMMARY : IBI costly currently long waitlists child need treatment . The investigator clinical ethical obligation determine appropriate alternative IBI child make gain child autism deserve treatment base need . This study design determine effectiveness functional skill group intervention , base principle apply behaviour analysis , child respond slowly IBI . Specifically , investigate effectiveness functional behavioural skill train addition IBI increase child 's independence day day communication self-help skill reduce behaviour problem , well increase parental competence decrease caregiver strain compare IBI alone . Having effective alternative IBI child make gain relevant standpoint ) preventing exposure potentially intrusive intervention child make gain IBI , ii ) allow child make gain IBI access effective treatment , iii ) opening limited IBI spot child would benefit IBI , iv ) make good use limit health resource . Overall , result interest parent , clinician , researcher fund body . HYPOTHESES Four main hypothesis present examine effectiveness involvement ABA functional skill group improve parent train functional skill behaviour young child ASD master ELM . We focus hypothesis child measure functional self help skill , behaviour cognition well parental measure caregiver strain sense competence . Participants ( i.e . child predict poor response IBI alone ) attend functional skill group 8 month : 1. great decrease interfere behaviour measure Developmental Behaviour Checklist rating behaviour observation compare child receive IBI alone . 2. great increase self-help measure Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales II , great independence eating , toileting , request , hand washing , respond name measure independent rating skill compare child receive IBI alone . 3. parent child great improvement sense competence parent great reduction caregiver strain , compare parent child receive IBI alone . 4. similar pattern little change cognitive function compare child receive IBI base Stanford Binet . In word , difference experimental control group measure cognitive functioning</brief_summary>
