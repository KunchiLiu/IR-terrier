	<detailed_description>Falls postural instability common complication advance Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) . Falls PD often devastate consequence , lead poor overall prognosis . In addition , fall PD associate substantial medical expense due treatment injury nurse home admission . The risk fall old PD patient aggravate `` generic '' age-related factor , sedative medication poor vision . Observations elderly person without PD suggest multifactorial prevention program might effective . We propose investigate effectiveness multifactorial prevention program aim prevention fall PD , base disease-specific treatment strategy demonstrate efficacy PD , well prevention strategy proven effectiveness general elderly population .
