	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Androgen deprivation therapy , goserelin , leuprolide , bicalutamide , may lessen amount androgen make body . Giving intensity-modulated radiation therapy together androgen deprivation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well intensity-modulated radiation therapy work treat patient undergo androgen deprivation therapy metastatic prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To evaluate time PSA relapse patient oligometastatic ( i.e. , ≤ 5 lesion ) hormone-sensitive prostate cancer treat 36 week androgen deprivation therapy localize radiotherapy know tumor site . - To assess PSA objective tumor response rate patient treat regimen . - To assess toxicity regimen patient . - To evaluate feasibility toxicity use helical tomotherapy image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy treat oligometastatic site patient . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord androgen-deprivation therapy status time study entry ( currently receive plan receive v complete almost complete ) . Patients currently androgen deprivation therapy time enrollment receive 36 week androgen deprivation therapy comprise goserelin subcutaneously leuprolide acetate intramuscularly every 4-12 week oral bicalutamide daily 36 week . Patients already receive androgen deprivation therapy time enrollment continue treatment receive total 36 week therapy . All patient undergo helical tomotherapy image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy beginning time achieve PSA normalization ( i.e. , stable decline PSA level ≤ 4 ng/mL stable decline PSA level ≤ pretreatment level , whichever small ) two consecutive measurement take androgen deprivation therapy initiate . All know metastatic site irradiate 2-7 week completion androgen deprivation therapy . Patients remain treatment PSA relapse , define increase PSA level pre-androgen deprivation therapy level &gt; 10 ng/mL , whichever small . Once patient meet criteria re-treatment androgen deprivation therapy , remove study . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
