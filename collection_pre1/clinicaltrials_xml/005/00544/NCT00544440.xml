	<brief_title>An Observational Study Continuous Oral Dosing Abiraterone Acetate Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients Evaluating Androgens Steroid Metabolites Bone Marrow Plasma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , open-label ( identity assign study drug know ) study investigate effect abiraterone acetate level testosterone dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) bone marrow plasma patient metastatic CRPC evaluate difference bone marrow androgen level patient without serum prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) decline . Approximately 60 medically surgically castrate male patient metastatic CRPC enrol . The study consist screening , treatment , follow-up period . Patients treat orally ( mouth ) abiraterone acetate 1000 mg daily prednisone 5 mg twice day clinical disease progression . Follow-up continue patient dy , lose follow-up withdraws inform consent . Bone marrow aspirate collect Week 1 ( predose ) , Week 9 , final study visit . Safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
