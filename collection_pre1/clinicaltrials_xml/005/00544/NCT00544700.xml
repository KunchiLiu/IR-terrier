	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether give bevacizumab maintenance therapy effective observation treat patient colorectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study bevacizumab see well work treat patient undergone first-line therapy metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Treating Patients Who Have Undergone First-Line Therapy Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To demonstrate time progression ( TTP ) without treatment inferior TTP maintenance therapy comprise bevacizumab patient metastatic colorectal cancer stable respond disease completion standard first-line chemotherapy/bevacizumab treatment . Secondary - To evaluate safety bevacizumab maintenance therapy patient . - To assess long-term cost implication prolong treatment bevacizumab . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord best response first-line chemotherapy/bevacizumab treatment ( complete response partial response v stable disease ) , duration first-line treatment ( 16-20 week v 21-24 week ) , type chemotherapy use first-line treatment ( irinotecan fluoropyrimidine v oxaliplatin fluoropyrimidine v fluoropyrimidine monotherapy ) , disease burden ( one organ metastasis vs one organ metastasis ) , participate center . - Arm I ( bevacizumab maintenance therapy ) : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II ( maintenance therapy ) : Patients receive treatment ; monitor disease progression . After completion study therapy documentation disease progression , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
