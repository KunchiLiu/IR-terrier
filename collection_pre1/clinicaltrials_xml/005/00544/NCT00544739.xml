	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular risk woman systematically underestimated - society physician . Women young 50 year age acute coronary syndrome 2x high mortality compare age-matched men . A number common vascular-disease-related condition frequent woman men . Women develop severe different form vascular disease men . Variability onset , relative risk , synergy traditional novel risk factor create challenge physician possibly result suboptimal management disregard woman present angina symptom . During last 10 year rise coronary artery disease ( CAD ) prevalence young woman observe . Emerging data suggest unique risk profile woman ( hypoestrogenemia adverse effect protract dysmetabolic state ) . The risk factor assessment risk factor profile woman associate CAD may different men thus merit reassessment . Purpose The primary objective study determine characteristic prognosis woman premature coronary artery disease evaluate extent atherosclerosis</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Premature Coronary Artery Disease Women - Risk Factors Prognosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>• Study Design Single-center , standardize , case-control study design assess prevalence significance novel traditional risk factor premature coronary artery disease woman . Phase I ( April 30th 2005- January 1st 2008 ) enrol woman onset symptomatic coronary artery disease 55 year age . The control group 347 clinically healthy , age match woman select National Health Survey WOBASZ study ( Polish Multicenter Population Study design Epidemiology Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Health Promotion Department Institute Cardiology ) accord specifically design questionnaire WOBASZ study , subject negative history CVD negative exertional chest pain include ( Rywik S , Kupść W , Piotrowski W , et al . Wieloośrodkowe ogólnopolskie badanie stanu zdrowia ludności - projekt WOBASZ Założenia metodyczne oraz logistyka . Kardiol Pol 2005 ; 63 ( supl.IV ) 605:613 ) . Definition premature CAD woman contain onset coronary artery disease ( myocardial infarction coronary revascularization ) 55 year age . Study participant enrol coronary angiography identification screen age admit patient acute coronary syndrome , stable angina revascularization procedure . At time enrollment , participant give write informed consent study . Information demographic factor , social characterization , life style , education , anthropometric measurement , symptom characteristic anamnesis , gynecologic history , family history CVD cancer , physical examination data , personal family history CVD , socioeconomic status , cardiovascular assessment medication use obtain use structured case report form questionnaire ( CRF ) . Additional fasting blood sample ( 15ml ) drawn every individual ( patient control ) freeze immediately -70 genetic study patient half blood sample centrifuge , separate , frozen immediately -70o processing . Baseline evaluation consist CRF data , collection coronary angiography , carotid ultrasonography laboratory data . The study protocol approve Institutional Review Boards Local Bioethics Committee . - Follow-up All patient contact 6 month discharge hospital , every 6 month , least 4 year , assess symptom status , menstrual status occurrence cardiovascular event ( MACE ) include death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , coronary revascularization , cardiac surgery hospitalization unstable angina . - Study Endpoints Primary Outcome Measures : 1 . To evaluate prevalence atherosclerosis risk factor woman premature CAD , include family history , social , environmental , clinical , traditional novel risk factor , menopausal status association early onset disease compare matched control . 2 . To evaluate association clinical factor extent advance atherosclerosis 3 . To evaluate predictive role clinical factor particular : impaired fasting glucose , abdominal obesity , hypertension , metabolic syndrome , inflammatory marker , coexist inflammatory immunologic disease prognosis 1 year long-term follow-up term MACE ( cardiovascular death , nonfatal MI , revascularization , hospitalization due heart failure III/IV acute coronary syndrome ) Secondary Outcome Measures : 1 . To evaluate predictive role clinical factor particular : impaired fasting glucose , abdominal obesity , hypertension , metabolic syndrome , inflammatory marker , coexist inflammatory immunologic disease prognosis term Vascular Events ( MACE , hospitalization due CAD progression , major arrhythmia , ICD implantation , stroke ) 2 . To evaluate predictive role clinical factor particular : impaired fasting glucose , abdominal obesity , hypertension , metabolic syndrome , inflammatory marker , coexist inflammatory immunologic disease prognosis term component Vascular Events total mortality Endpoints assessment : Independent endpoint classification committee comprise 2 involve study procedure cardiologists review documentation event classify . The study may significant implication improvement , identification management female patient risk premature atherosclerosis provide gender-specific data efficacy safety cardiovascular medication . Better scientific recognition result well awareness risk effective prevention coronary artery disease young female , optimize delivery heart care population young woman rationale guideline specific woman .</detailed_description>
