	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , PR-104 , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well PR-104 work treat patient previously untreated relapsed small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PR104 Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Estimate response rate PR-104 patient treatment-naive sensitive-relapse small cell lung cancer . - Evaluate safety drug patient . Secondary - Evaluate survival patient . - Evaluate progression-free survival patient . - Evaluate time progression patient . - Assess pharmacokinetics ( PK ) PR-104 alcohol metabolite . - Estimate rate hypoxia use 18F-fluoromisonidazole ( FMISO ) positron emission topography ( PET ) imaging . - Collect plasma sample assessment potential biomarkers tumor hypoxia . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease type ( treatment-naive v sensitive-relapse ) . Patients receive PR-104 intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course ( treatment-naive patient ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( sensitive-relapse patient ) . PK study perform course 1 course 3 . Blood collect baseline , course 1 , study completion biomarker study tumor hypoxia ( plasma protein ) . Patients also undergo FMISO PET fludeoxyglucose F18 ( FDG ) PET scan baseline second course study therapy .</detailed_description>
