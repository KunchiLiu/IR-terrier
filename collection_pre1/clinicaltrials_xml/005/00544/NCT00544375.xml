	<brief_summary>The study quantify functional measure red blood cell mass oxygen neonatal tissue use non-invasive optical technique : near infrared optical spectroscopy . The study determine absolute concentration deoxygenate oxygenated hemoglobin calculate tissue hemoglobin saturation total hemoglobin concentration viv . Near infrared optical spectroscopy technique use assess define tissue status anemic state tissue 's response transfusion , well monitor hemoglobin hematocrit without pain loss blood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Near infrared optical spectroscopy measurement conduct muscle , upper leg , arm back , abdomen head . The actual location depend upon neonate position size . A small soft plastic optical fiber probe place select study area thhe time measurement exceed 1 hour . NIRS measurement hemoglobin hemoglobin saturation tissue red-cell transfusion VLBW infant determine true effect transfusion , develop substantial guideline regard indication transfusion . The accuracy conventional ( invasive ) measurement Hb Hct could comparison result NIRS technique clinical usefulness NIRS technique could evaluate comparison trend conventionally measure value take fluid status account . Near-infrared light ionize biological tissue pose significant health risk . Since water absorption low within spectral range , local heating tissue also minimal . Burns heat damage neonate highly unlikely .</detailed_description>
