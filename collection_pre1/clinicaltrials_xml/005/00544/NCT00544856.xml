	<brief_summary>A recent meta-analysis include 29.000 individual find odds ratio ( OR ) individual high brain reserve compare low 0.54 ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) , risk decrease 46 % . Among factor influence cognitive reserve , mentally stimulating activity robust factor control education , age , occupation potential confounds . The brain reserve effect sustain median longitudinal follow-up 7 year . It would interest detect whether complex cognitive training could show similar effect cognitive ability patient mild Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) report previous study base mentally stimulating activity analysis . The hypothesis complex cognitive training alters neural network subject group alteration associate improvement stabilization cognitive non-cognitive function . The investigator perform complex cognitive training program . Twenty patient mild AD twenty four patient MCI recruit study . The patient randomise control- treatment groups.Additionally indirect effect non-cognitive function evaluate caregiver patient . The investigator expect cognitive non-cognitive ability change cognitive training . The investigator also expect difference treatment control group .</brief_summary>
