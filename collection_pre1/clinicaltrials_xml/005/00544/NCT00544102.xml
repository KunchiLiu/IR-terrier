	<brief_summary>This study test effect insulin resistance atherosclerosis ( harden artery ) woman systemic lupus erythematosus , commonly know lupus . Women lupus high chance develop atherosclerosis general population , result susceptible heart attack stroke . Insulin resistance particular risk factor atherosclerosis , recent small study show insulin resistance common lupus patient without lupus . The study consist series test design ass whether association insulin resistance atherosclerosis woman lupus . This research may lead study possible treatment reduce risk heart disease lupus patient . Volunteers must woman 30 55 year age diagnose lupus within five year prior study . Volunteers kidney failure , diabetes , exist atherosclerosis exclude study , volunteer pulse steroid therapy within four week test pregnant within one year test . Participants undergo follow procedure outpatient basis : - Blood urine test research purpose . - Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) test general health heart . - Oral glucose tolerance test measure blood glucose insulin level . This test commonly use diagnose diabetes pre-diabetic insulin resistance . - Cardiac multidetector compute tomography ( MDCT ) determine amount calcium present coronary artery . This test use diagnose atherosclerosis . - Carotid artery ultrasound show speed blood flow carotid artery . This test show abnormalities and/or blockage carotid artery . - Abdominal ultrasound determine participant hepatic steatosis ( fatty liver ) , often find individual insulin resistance diabetes . - Carotid artery magnetic resonance imaging/angiogram ( MRI/MRA ) measure thickness blood vessel . This test use diagnose atherosclerosis . - Abdominal MRI estimate abdominal fat . Volunteers may ask participate MRI/MRA study evaluate artery heart . This test optional require insulin resistance/atherosclerosis study . The entire series procedure require one three visit complete .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Women With Lupus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women lupus five- ten-fold increase risk coronary heart disease compare general population . Several decade ago , woman lupus die shortly develop disease , death attribute previously undiagnosed untreated active lupus . But die year diagnosis lupus , death attribute complication atherosclerosis ( harden artery ) . Similar lupus , atherosclerosis consider inflammatory disease . Inflammation play major role atherosclerosis , result fatty deposit , cholesterol material accumulate blood vessel . The combination atherosclerosis lupus greatly increase risk cardiovascular disease among woman . Research identify many factor contribute risk atherosclerosis people lupus . These include high blood pressure abnormal cholesterol level , chronic inflammation , antibodies attack protein regulate blood vessel , medication use treat lupus . In general population , diabetes important risk factor atherosclerosis . A silent condition call insulin resistance lead diabetes associate atherosclerosis population lupus . Recent study show people lupus likely insulin resistance without disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Women 3055 year age . Must give write informed consent prior entry protocol . Must fulfill least 4 classification criterion SLE define American College Rheumatology . Diagnosis SLE make 5 year prior study participation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnancy within one year study participation . Women childbearing potential require negative pregnancy test screening . Previous diagnosis Type 1 2 diabetes mellitus . History cerebrovascular accident ( CVA : presence irreversible partially reversible motor and/or sensory deficit sudden recent onset basis vascular occlusion insufficiency , complete , incomplete evolution , persist great 24 hour last less 24 hour anatomic correlate ) . Previous diagnosis peripheral vascular disease ( PVD : presence arterial claudication [ pain muscle upper low extremity , induce exercise relieve rest , absent pulse and/or confirm Doppler flow study and/or angiography ] last great 6 month and/or evidence gangrene significant tissue ( digit limb ) loss attributable Raynaud phenomenon ) . Therapy pulse methylprednisolone pulse prednisone within 4 week study participation . Initiation change dosage antilipemic agent within precede six week . Any active viral bacterial infection Significant concurrent medical condition , opinion Principal Investigator , could affect patient ability tolerate complete study . Clinical coronary artery disease ( CAD ) define : history MI and/or definite classic angina ( substernal chest discomfort provoke exertion emotion relieve rest nitroglycerine ) , and/or conclusive evidence MI ECG Renal failure define hemodialysisdependant , calculate GFR le equal 30 mL/minute ( calculate MDRD 4 variable formula ) .</criteria>
