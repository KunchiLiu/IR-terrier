	<brief_title>Continuous Versus Interrupted Abdominal Wall Closure After Emergency Midline Laparotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 700.000 open abdominal surgery ( laparotomy ) perform year Germany ( 2 ) . A major surgical complication laparotomy abdominal fascia dehiscence might appear either early ( burst abdomen evisceration ) late complication ( incisional hernia ) . These patient usually undergo surgery secondary fascial closure associate markedly increase morbidity ( 3 ) include high recurrence rate ( 45 % ) ( 4 ) . The applied surgical strategy abdominal wall closure ( i.e . combination suture technique material ) high relevance prevention fascia dehiscence , moreover , constitute main factor directly controllable surgeon . While several randomized control trial ( RCT ) ( 3 ; 5-8 ) well meta-analyses ( 9-12 ) exist address issue optimal fascia closure elective laparotomy , RCT deal exclusively emergency set . As result abdominal fascia closure perform accord surgeon 's individual preference rather accord evidence-based data . Therefore , present RCT design compare establish strategy ( continuous slowly absorbable suture interrupt rapidly absorbable suture ) abdominal wall closure order determine difference strategy midline incision .</detailed_description>
