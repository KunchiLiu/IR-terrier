	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying PET scan give patient cancer undergo treatment may help doctor predict patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study PET scan patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma receive rituximab together cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET Scans Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Receiving Rituximab , Cyclophosphamide , Doxorubicin , Vincristine , Prednisone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate early positive positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan 2 course rituximab cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine , prednisone use identify group patient poor prognosis . Secondary - To compare modify PET/CT scan response criterion revise standard response criterion . - To evaluate , prospective manner , whether proliferation-inducing ligand ( APRIL ) expression prognostic factor patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive rituximab IV , cyclophosphamide IV , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , vincristine IV day 1 oral prednisone day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Rituximab IV alone continue additional 2 course completion initial 6 course . Patients undergo positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan prior completion study therapy . Patients also undergo PET scan course 2 , positive PET result undergo additional PET scan course 4 . Previously collect tumor sample analyze proliferation-inducing ligand ( APRIL ) expression . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
