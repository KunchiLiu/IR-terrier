	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose R- ( - ) -gossypol acetic acid give together cisplatin etoposide treat patient advance solid tumor extensive stage small cell lung cancer . R- ( - ) -gossypol acetic acid may stop growth cancer block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin etoposide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving R- ( - ) -gossypol acetic acid together combination chemotherapy may help kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) AT-101 ( R- ( - ) -gossypol ) combine cisplatin etoposide patient advance , refractory solid tumor and/or extensive stage small cell lung cancer ( ES-SCLC ) . In addition , determine MTD RP2D AT-101 combine cisplatin , etoposide , Neulasta . II . To evaluate toxicity tolerability AT-101 combination cisplatin etoposide patient advanced , refractory solid tumor and/or ES-SCLC . In addition , evaluate toxicity tolerability AT-101 cisplatin , etoposide , Neulasta . III . To evaluate antitumor activity combination per tumor measurement use Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pharmacokinetics AT-101 single agent combination cisplatin etoposide plasma . II . To perform pharmacodynamic study ( genotyping drug metabolize enzyme , gene expression , proteomics drug-related pathway ) archive blood sample patient treat AT-101 combination cisplatin etoposide . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study R- ( - ) -gossypol . Patients receive oral R- ( - ) -gossypol twice daily day 1-3 , cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1* , etoposide IV 30 minute day 1*-3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course dose escalation 4 course expand extensive stage small cell lung cancer cohort , absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect day 1 course 1 2 pharmacokinetic analysis , biomarker assay , correlative study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day . [ Note : *Cisplatin etoposide start day 2 course 1 ; give day 1 subsequent course . ]</detailed_description>
