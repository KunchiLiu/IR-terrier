	<brief_summary>The main purpose study see T-lymphocytes safe . To make Ad-specific T lymphocytes investigator obtain blood stem cell donor transfer Ad another type blood cell , call monocyte . These cell stimulate T lymphocytes train kill cell infected Ad . The investigator grow Ad-specific T lymphocytes stimulation Ad-infected monocyte third type blood cell call B lymphoblast donor . After test T -lymphocytes , investigator inject patient transplant high risk serious Ad virus infection . The investigator make sure injected cell safe see affect growth behavior adenoviruses patient 's body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Viral infection one major cause morbidity mortality patient receive bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) unrelated mismatched donor . This increase risk infection relate number factor include immunosuppressive regimen patient receive , delay immune recovery great genetic disparity donor recipient result defective interaction antigen present cell immune system effector cell . In case viral infection post BMT result reactivation latent virus CMV , EBV adenoviruses ( Ad ) common viral pathogen cause disease transplant . The incidence Ad infection &gt; 25 % patient risk first 100 day transplant 1 2 . In transplant population , adenovirus recoverable many site may cause hemorrhagic cystitis , pneumonitis , nephritis , hepatitis , colitis pancreatitis , often severe morbidity mortality approach 60 % 3 . The frequently use drug treatment adenoviral infection Cidofovir . But occasional report response Cidofovir , approve antiviral agent proven efficacy treatment severe Ad disease , prospective randomize , control trial potentially useful anti-Ad therapy 4 . With increase use so-called submyeloablative reduce intensity , highly immunosuppressive conditioning regimen , high rate Ad infections/reactivation observe due prolong immune suppression . The onset Ad disease/reactivation recently report occur median 18 day post-transplant ( range -7/ &gt; +100 ) 2 . As viral complication patient clearly associate lack recovery virus-specific cellular immune response , reconstitution host vitro expand CTLs effective approach prevent treat disease . Adoptive immunotherapy vitro expand CTLs prove effective prevent treat disease related Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) infections 5 ; 6 cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) reactivations7 hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) recipient . A promising strategy generate donor-derived Ad-specific CTL infection monocyte direct CTL response viral capsid antigens8 . This approach allow exposure protein Ad protein coat , lead presentation multiple , undefined antigen epitope . Hence , investigator plan use recombinant Ad vector infection donor-derived monocyte . These infected monocyte use antigen present cell ( APC ) generate Ad-specific CTL vitro . For expansion Ad-specific CTL , second stimulation use irradiate , Ad-infected monocyte subsequent stimulation use donor-derived Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines ( LCL ) transduce Ad vector APC 9 . The investigator propose evaluate approach prophylaxis Ad reactivation disease recipient match unrelated donor mismatch family member bone marrow allograft , high risk complication . Initially , investigator give donor-derived Ad-specific CTLs patient dose escalation study determine safety immunologic virologic efficacy .</detailed_description>
