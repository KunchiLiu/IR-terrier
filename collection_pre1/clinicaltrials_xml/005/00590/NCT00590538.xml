	<brief_summary>The purpose research study test new combination medicine , Phenylbutyrate Genistein , determine could use treat cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . The common genetic mutation find patient CF call Delta F508 . Due mutation , lack salt ( chloride ) movement nose , sinus , lung , intestine , pancreas sweat gland . This lack movement cause clinical manifestation disease . Although Phenylbutyrate extensively use treat patient rare metabolic disease , Phenylbutyrate investigational drug purpose study . Genistein naturally occur substance find food product soy tofu , also investigational drug study . When use together , drug may able restore normal chloride salt ( water ) movement body organs glands people CF . We study salt water movement nose technique call nasal transepithelial potential difference ( NPD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phenylbutyrate/Genistein Duotherapy Delta F508-Heterozygotes ( Cystic Fibrosis )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol investigate novel pharmaceutical agent ( Phenylbutyrate Genistein ) , aim improve physiologic function mutant Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator ( CFTR ) . CFTR absent dysfunctional cystic fibrosis . Nasal epithelial CFTR function assess NPD procedure . We test hypothesis : 1 . Phenylbutyrate give orally 4 day safe adult Delta F508- heterozygous subject CF result small improvement nasal epithelial CFTR function . 2 . Topical administration Genistein nasal epithelia Phenylbutyrate treat Delta F508-heterozygous CF subject safe lead augmentation improve nasal epithelial CFTR function observe Phenylbutyrate treatment , placebo treatment . Study Flow If eligibility confirm screen visit , additional 3 outpatient visit 1-2 week period , last 2-4 hour . Visit 1 , study relate safety evaluation complete . There also Nasal Potential Difference ( NPD ) measurement perform . To measure nasal potential , voltage , small butterfly needle place skin forearm connect thin plastic tube monitoring device . A small soft plastic catheter tube place inner surface nose . This catheter pump small amount saltwater onto nose connect monitoring machine . This machine sense small electrical voltage generate body . It send electricity shock subject . A measurement make fluid pump nose change one contain drug call amiloride . Amiloride change makeup salt transport nose reduces electrical voltage . Then fluid change saltwater contain chloride . The fluid change one drug isoproterenol . Isoproterenol cause cell subject without CF move chloride . The dos amiloride isoproterenol use study much low typically used patient reason . Finally , fluid change one contain experimental drug Genistein . Subject randomize give 4-day supply study drug . Visit 2 , subject safety evaluation NPD perform manner previous visit . No study drug visit . Visit 3 , subject safety evaluation NPD perform without perfusion Genistein .</detailed_description>

Willing practice reliable studyaccepted method contraception study . 3 . Diagnosis cystic fibrosis consisting : 1. clinical manifestation cystic fibrosis 2. either cystic fibrosis genotype heterozygous Delta F508 second identify CFTR mutation , cystic fibrosis genotype one Delta F508 allele one unidentified allele sweat sodium chloride &gt; 60 mEq/L 4 . Oxyhemoglobin saturation great equal 92 % breathing room air 1 . Underlying disease likely limit life span and/or increase risk complication : 1 . Cancer require treatment past 5 year , exception cancer cure , opinion investigator , carry good prognosis nonmelanoma skin cancer , papillary thyroid carcinoma , cervical cancer situ . 2 . GI disease . Inflammatory bowel disease require treatment past year ii . elevation ALT AST level great 3 time upper limit normal 2 . Conditions behavior likely affect conduct study 1 . Current anticipated participation another intervention research project 2 . Recent ( 2 month ) sinus surgery nasal polypectomy 3 . Currently pregnant less 3 month postpartum 4 . Currently nurse within 6 week complete nurse 5 . Unwilling undergo pregnancy test report possible confirmed pregnancy promptly course study 6 . Unwilling use reliable contraceptive method two month completion study . 7 . Major psychiatric disorder , , opinion investigator , would impede conduct study , e.g. , alcoholism 8 . Other condition , , opinion investigator , would impede conduct study . 3 . Glucocorticoids topical , ophthalmic , inhaled preparation . 4 . Conditions would place patient increase risk complication : 1 . Pneumothorax within last 12 month 2 . Uncontrolled diabetes 3 . Asthma allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis require systemic glucocorticoid therapy within last two month 4 . Sputum culture grow pathogen vitro sensitivity least two type antibiotic could administer patient 5 . History major hemoptysis : ( Greater 240 mL blood within 24hour period within last 12 month ) . 5 . Medication use condition specifically mention , include severe end stage CF lung disease , may serve criterion exclusion discretion investigator . 6 . History significant cardiovascular disease , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , unstable arrhythmia , uncontrolled hypertension .</criteria>
