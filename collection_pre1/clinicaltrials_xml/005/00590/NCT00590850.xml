	<brief_summary>Clavicle ( collar bone ) fracture account 33 % fracture around shoulder . Some surgeon suggest surgical treatment best option , others suggest nonoperative care best treatment . There evidence date either option superior . For reason , propose conduct prospective , randomized clinical trial surgical versus non-surgical treatment displace high-energy clavicle fracture . This study use objective clinical patient-based outcome measure . The purpose study see difference clinical outcome ( heal rate , time healing , time return work , Constant Score , complication ) , functional outcome ( DASH Score ) , health relate quality life ( SF-36 ) nonoperative care two type surgical care displace fracture clavicular shaft adult . Included patient randomize one three group : nonoperative care ( Group N ) ; surgical care use plate screw ( Group P ) ; surgical care use intramedullary pin put inside clavicle stabilize ( Group I ) .</brief_summary>
