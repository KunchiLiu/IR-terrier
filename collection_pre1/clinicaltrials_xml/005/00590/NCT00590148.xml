	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate FIM™ measure daily function child sickle cell disease hospitalize vasoocclusive pain . Currently , standard pain assessment rating pain intensity , determine observation ( young child ) self-report ( old child adolescent ) . However , measure pain intensity effective recurrent chronic pain state , sickle cell disease particular . Pediatric patient hospitalize vasoocclusive pain often report decrease pain intensity ; however , indication clinical status , ambulation , less use opiate patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) pump , increase food intake , transition oral pain medication , signify patient may improve . As result inability get accurate picture patient ' condition , would like summary improvement would reflect change clinical status reflect reduce impact sickle cell pain patient 's life . In study , plan evaluate standardize functional assessment measure pediatric patient sickle cell disease . It hypothesize FIM™ score correlate indicator clinical status , movement , quality sleep , use IV opiates patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) pump , use intravenous vs. oral pain medication . It also hypothesize FIM™ demonstrate adequate responsiveness change functional status within 3-7 day hospitalization progressive increase score association indicator clinical improvement .</brief_summary>
