	<brief_title>Clinical Molecular-Metabolic Phase II Trial Perifosine Recurrent/Progressive Malignant Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II study small molecule inhibitor perifosine ( NSC 639966 , D21266 , KRX-0401 ) treatment patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) recurrent malignant glioma . The goal phase II study determine efficacy measure progressionfree survival rate 6 month treatment . Secondary goal include determination molecular metabolic effect perifosine tissue analysis PET imaging . In addition , cytoreductive surgery recommend part standard care study entry , patient consider `` surgical arm . '' In case , patient receive perifosine 5-10 day surgery tumor aliquoted diagnostic purpose molecular effect drug vivo analysis drug penetration tumor tissue .</detailed_description>

Patients must adequate bone marrow function Patients must agree practice adequate contraception . Patients must take EIAEDs Patients must significant medical illness history investigator 's opinion adequately control appropriate therapy would compromise patient 's ability tolerate therapy . Patients history cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix ) , unless complete remission therapy disease minimum 3 year ineligible . Patients must active infection serious intercurrent medical illness . HIVPositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study due possible retroviral drug interaction . Patients must disease obscure toxicity dangerously alter drug metabolism .</criteria>
