	<detailed_description>B . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Burden disease Barrett 's esophagus ( BE ) acquire condition result chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease well recognize pre-malignant condition development esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) ( 1 , 2 ) . BE define displacement squamocolumnar junction proximal gastroesophageal junction presence intestinal metaplasia ( 15 ) . This condition entail 30 50 fold great risk development EAC incidence development EAC approach 0.5 % annually ( 3 , 4 ) . EAC highly lethal cancer rapidly increase cancer United States Western Europe incremental increase 4-10 % per year . Although survival rate improve recent year country , overall 5-year survival rate still dismal 10 % Western population ( 5-7 ) . Clinical strategy prevent deaths cancer focus technique identification esophageal neoplasms asymptomatic , early , curable stage . Therefore , endoscopic screen subject chronic reflux symptom recommend method detect BE early cancer ( 8 ) . Patients BE routinely enrol surveillance program attempt identify might benefit treatment pre-invasive stage EAC ultimate aim reduce cancer relate death ( 8 ) . Limitations current Barrett 's surveillance protocol Current guideline surveillance include take biopsy specimen endoscopically visible mucosal abnormality follow random 4-quadrant biopsy every 2 cm throughout entire length BE ( 15 ) . Unfortunately , effectiveness strategy hamper numerous factor . Apart labor intensive time consume patient ; accuracy protocol limit sampling error . Biopsy specimens short segment tongue columnar mucosa generally reveal intestinal metaplasia 40-60 % patient ( 16 ) . In study 570 patient undergoing upper endoscopy , BE suspect 146 patient ; however , 60 patient diagnosis confirm biopsy . Short segment BE ( SSBE ) frequently suspect long segment BE ( LSBE ) correctly diagnose 25 % time compare 55 % LSBE ( 17 ) . Similar distribution metaplastic tissue , presence dysplasia early adenocarcinoma within Barrett 's segment patchy focal . Standard endoscopy random biopsy might fail detect lesion . Early neoplastic lesion visible eye endoscopist standard endoscopy random biopsy sample small proportion epithelium risk . Also , `` hit miss '' nature biopsy increase cost procedure limit reliability histologic interpretation dysplasia . The increase use endoscopy lead patient diagnose BE offer surveillance . Also , number patient follow , potentially curative therapy offer , increase . The advent new method endoscopic treatment high-grade dysplasia ( HGD ) early EAC form ablative therapy EMR make highly desirable diagnose dysplasia EAC early disease process . This may help alleviate morbidity mortality associate esophagectomy EAC . These compelling reason couple limitation current surveillance protocol make development new approach aim improve efficacy Barrett 's surveillance mandatory . Novel image technique endoscopic therapy Significant effort expend development new GI technique order provide precise even `` real time '' endoscopic diagnosis . Chromoendoscopy technique involve application agent improve characterization mucosa result selective uptake enhancement mucosal surface pattern ( 11 ) . HRE unit equip charge-coupled device million pixel allow clear visualization fine mucosal detail may facilitate detection early neoplastic lesion ( 9 ) . NBI novel endoscopic technique base optical phenomenon depth light penetration tissue dependent wavelength ; short wavelength , superficial penetration . Use blue light narrow band filter enable detailed image mucosal vascular surface pattern within BE segment high level resolution contrast without need chromoendoscopy . The main chromophore esophageal tissue visible wavelength hemoglobin , maximum absorptive wavelength near 415 nm . This within wavelength NBI responsible reveal superficial vasculature ( 10 ) . Esophagectomy consider criterion standard treatment patient early EAC . However , associate significant morbidity mortality , even experience surgical hand high-volume surgical center . EMR use increasingly replace surgery curative treatment modality early EAC patient BE ( 12 , 13 ) . It allow effective local treatment early cancer , histological analysis resect specimen thus confirmation diagnosis complete resection lesion . Ablative therapy BE patient provide promising result well ( 18 , 19 ) . C. PRELIMINARY DATA Our group recently assess potential NBI prediction histology screen surveillance endoscopy BE patient ( 10 ) . Images obtain system classify accord mucosal ( ridge/villous , circular , irregular/distorted ) vascular ( normal , abnormal ) pattern correlate histology prospective blind fashion . The sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ridge/villous pattern diagnosis intestinal metaplasia without high-grade dysplasia ( HGD ) 93.5 % , 87 % , 95 % respectively . The sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value irregular/distorted pattern HGD 100 % , 99 % , 95 % respectively . These promising result validate investigator . Similarly , Dr. Sharma publish several study involve use chromoendoscopy patient BE . In study 80 patient columnar line esophagus use indigo carmine dye 115x magnification endoscopy , three mucosal pattern state identify . The presence ridge/villous pattern detect intestinal metaplasia high sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( 97 % , 76 % , 92 % respectively ) . Six patient irregular/distorted pattern biopsy reveal HGD patient ( 11 ) . Our group active evaluate role ablative therapy patient BE . We recently assess long-term efficacy achieve complete reversal ( endoscopic histologic ) multipolar electrocoagulation argon plasma coagulation patient BE assess factor influence successful ablation . A total 35 BE patient follow least 2 year follow ablative therapy complete reversal BE achieve 70 % patient , regardless ablative technique ( 19 ) . The International Working Group Classification Oesophagitis forefront classification grade acid-peptic related esophageal disease erosive esophagitis BE . Sharma et al develop validated endoscopic grade system BE ( Prague C &amp; M criterion ) . The criterion include assessment circumferential ( C ) maximal ( M ) extent endoscopically visualize BE segment along endoscopic landmark . This grade system demonstrate high validity endoscopic assessment visualize BE length ( 20 ) . D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Overview Patients know / suspect BE Pre-registration , inform consent Standard endoscopy follow HRE , NBI chromoendoscopy Digital video-recording endoscopy finding ( Subsequent de-identification patient information ) Target biopsy suspect lesion Removal abnormal lesion EMR / mucosal ablation Pathologist histologic interpretation This part multicenter study initiate Kansas City . Patients recruit Amsterdam , Mainz , Wiesbaden Kansas City . Methods Physical examination questionnaire All patient complete validate GERD questionnaire ( GERQ ) ( 21 ) record duration , severity , frequency heartburn regurgitation supplemental information medication acid suppressive therapy , aspirin , NSAIDs , etc . Demographic information clinical finding height , weight waist circumference record . Endoscopic procedure The endoscopic procedure perform high-resolution endoscope ( Olympus GIF-Q240Z , GIF-Q160Z , recent version ) capability perform NBI push switch . Standard method conscious sedation cardiopulmonary monitoring use procedure . The distal esophagus carefully inspect presence erosion , nodule plaque . The presence size hiatal hernia record . A plastic disposable distal attachment cap ( e.g . Olympus D-201-11802 ) free distal distance 2-3 mm attach endoscope order fix mucosal area interest image biopsy take . The endoscopist blind previous BE histology patient . The classification mucosal vascular pattern perform standardized manner group describe .
