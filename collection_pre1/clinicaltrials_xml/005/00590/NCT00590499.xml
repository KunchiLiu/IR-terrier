	<brief_summary>Agitation significant clinical issue anesthesiology critical care medicine . Several study carry survey epidemic agitation post-anesthesia care unit intensive care unit , result reveal agitation adverse impact outcome . To clinical experience , agitation occur postoperative neurosurgical patient , often difficult manage . However , agitation subset patient poorly evaluate . In present study , adult patient follow craniotomy enrol consecutively , incidence , risk factor outcome emergent agitation investigate . The result study provide basic data prevention treatment agitation postoperative neurosurgical patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Agitation Post Operative Neurosurgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study enroll 120 consecutive adult patient admit Neuro-ICU post-operative care follow craniotomy . Sedation-Agitation Scale ( SAS ) evaluate documented every hour need stay ICU nurse duty . Emergent agitation define SAS 5 7 anytime first 24 hr ICU stay.Patients divide 2 group : non-agitation group ( SAS 1-4 ) agitation group ( SAS 5-7 ) .Data collection include pre-operative record , event anesthesia operation , event ICU stay , outcomes . The primary outcome complication self-removal endotracheal tube , central venous bladder catheter . The secondary third outcome ICU stay Glasgow Outcome Scale hospital discharge , respectively . Incidence agitation calculate present epidemiological knowledge . Univariate analysis two group use preliminary selection model variable . Then stepwise block logistic regression apply model risk agitation use significant univariate predictor .</detailed_description>
