	<brief_summary>The purpose study find approved medicine use low cholesterol call Lipitor slow stop progressive narrow aortic heart valve patient condition call aortic stenosis . Patients aortic stenosis volunteer study take Lipitor 2 year undergo brief exam physician , labwork measure cholesterol , routine heart ultrasound ( sound picture heart ) start study every 6 month , stop 2 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Lipitor Aortic Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , single-center study assess effect atorvastatin 40 mg/day ( Lipitor , Pfizer ) progression calcific aortic stenosis approximately 70 patient mild moderate calcific AS tricuspid bicuspid aortic valve . As control population , publish data historical AS cohort use , employ accept rate progression decrease aortic valve area 0.1 cmÂ²/year . Additionally , also comparison , prospectively study registry AS patient meet entry criterion either currently already treat refuse take HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor ( refer `` standard care '' group ) . All patient visit , laboratory study , echocardiogram perform Cleveland Clinic Foundation Cleveland , Ohio exception 12-week visit ALT measurement may do patient 's local doctor 's office result fax Imaging Research . The 12-week follow-up assessment may complete phone establish change patient status since baseline , study medication compliance , concomitant medication use ascertain whether appropriate laboratory test obtain . Over 2-year period , assessment conduct baseline , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month .</detailed_description>
