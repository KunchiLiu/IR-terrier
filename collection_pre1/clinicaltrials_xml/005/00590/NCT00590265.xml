Reasons study termination serious side-effects , development suicidal ideation hypomanic/manic symptom , patient 's decision , exclusion criterion fulfil course study . Depressive manic/hypomanic symptom , quality life , sleep quality side-effects assess baseline study . Biological parameter also measure along study .
