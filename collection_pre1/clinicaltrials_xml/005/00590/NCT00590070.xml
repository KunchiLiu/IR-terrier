	<detailed_description>The occurrence no-reflow phenomenon recanalization infarct relate artery acute myocardial infarction describe 40 % case . This event associate bad prognosis follow unfavourable leave ventricular remodelling . Two main pathogenetic mechanism cause no-reflow : distal embolization ischemia-reperfusion injury . Microembolization , may well prevent mechanic approach ( device-based ) , play course important role no-reflow primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( primary PCI ) , however ischemia reperfusion injury also independent microemboli , indeed occur animal model ligation non atherosclerotic coronary . Thrombus aspiration assist primary intervention achieve complete resolution ST segment 60 % patient , whereas result filter base study substantially negative . A recent meta-analysis confirm thrombus aspiration improve microvascular perfusion , whereas filter . Taken together available data suggest approach need test conjunction mechanical one improve microvascular integrity set . Importantly , current antiplatelet therapy reperfusion therapy acute MI abolish no-reflow phenomenon . Based experience mature many study basic cardiology investigate model ischemia reperfusion various drug test human model . Two drug emerge particular possible adjunct reperfusion therapy : nitroprusside adenosine . For former good result obtain small series , contrast adenosine test large randomize trial ( AMISTAD-II trial ) controversial result use low dose . Another study use large dos sub-analysis high dose group AMISTAD-II trial suggest beneficial effect infarct size . Importantly , none study perform set thrombus aspiration . Due multifactorial pathogenesis no-reflow acute MI combine mechanic pharmacologic approach believe offer good solution achieve optimal microvascular reperfusion . Thus , randomize study ass effect nitroprusside adenosine adjunct current best therapy ( thrombus aspiration IIb-IIIa antagonist ) ST elevation MI use ST segment resolution standard 12 lead ECG primary endpoint myocardial reperfusion . Study Design The REOPEN-AMI placebo-controlled , randomize , open label , blind-examination ( PROBE ) , multicenter , trial effect intracoronary adenosine nitroprusside coronary reflow patient undergoing primary rescue PCI thrombus-aspiration . The recruiting period comprise 1 year time January 2008 December 2008 . During last month , others participate centre Italy , contact enter study agreement . As result prospective recruitment start time participate center . Each center , activate study , warrant ( fully describe search process well characteristic internal database ) ability provide detail data regard patient . The study protocol comply declaration Helsinki approve ethic committee coordinate center . Informed consent treat group ( adenosine nitroprusside ) placebo obtain patient enrol study METHODS All patient receive intravenous administration abciximab prior PCI . After wire crossing , thrombus aspiration perform . The device remove outside body , flushed saline subsequently reintroduce culprit vessel beyond occlusion site intracoronary drug selectively administer . At stage patient randomize either intracoronary Adenosine ( 80 mcg fast bolus follow 2 mg give 33cc saline 2 minute slow bolus ) , nitroprusside ( 60 mcg fast bolus follow 100 mcg give 33cc 5 % glucose 2 minute slow bolus ) placebo ( 33 cc heparinized saline give 2 minute slow bolus ) . Due short half-life drug choose bolus plus infusion regimen order allow sustain effect two drug microcirculation . The safety efficacy drug regimen test small pilot study catheterization laboratory . We compare two drug regimens traditional single bolus administration adenosine evaluation fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) ten patient ( 5 adenosine 5 nitroprusside ) undergoing pressure wire evaluation intermediate stenosis . We find similar FFR group prolong dilatation microcirculation compare group traditional single bolus adenosine administration ( data show ) . If thrombus aspiration device advance mechanical reason culprit vessel , drug administration perform trough guide catheter predilatation . Data analyze accord intention treat principle . Angiographic measure Coronary angiogram obtain aim facilitate angiographic analysis ( long acquisition without magnification ) . All CDs primary PCI send coordinator center process extrapolate image regard baseline , thrombus aspiration , diver reintroduction culprit lesion beyond occlusion site post-PCI view . The core laboratory centralize , blind analyse Catholic University Rome . For patient coronary angiogram analyze ass following : - Antegrade coronary flow accord standard TIMI criterion flow - Corrected TIMI Frame Count accord Gibson - MBG accord va n't Hof et al . - Thrombus score accord TIMI study group ( 0= cineangiographic characteristic thrombus present ; 1 = possible thrombus present angiography characteristic reduce contrast density , haziness , irregular lesion contour , smooth convex meniscus site total occlusion suggestive diagnostic thrombus . 2 = definite thrombus , great dimension &lt; 1/2 vessel diameter ; 3 = definite thrombus , great linear dimension &gt; 1/2 &lt; 2 vessel diameter ; 4 = definite thrombus , large dimension &gt; 2 vessel diameter ; 5= total occlusion ) ; - collateral grade accord Rentrop Angiographic `` no-reflow '' define final TIMI flow ≤ 2 TIMI flow 3 MBG &lt; 2 . Intracoronary ECG Monitoring intracoronary ST segment PCI , end procedure perform accord flow chart . The technique describe elsewhere ( 22 ) . Briefly , proximal end wire choose recanalization use unipolar derivation substitute V5 lead precordial ECG . ST resolution monitor procedure ECG acquisition do baseline , effective thrombus aspiration , intracoronary drug administration end procedure . Each ECG quantitatively assess . Lack resolution define ST elevation resolution &lt; 30 % . Partial resolution consider ST resolution ≥30 % &lt; 70 % . Furthermore time need obtain full partial ST resolution record . Anginal pain start time point assess . 12-leads surface ECG After procedure , 90 min , standard 12 lead ECG use evaluate ST resolution single lead , show maximal ST elevation , sum multiple lead , show ST elevation admission . Lack ST resolution define ST resolution &lt; 30 % . Partial resolution ST resolution &lt; 70 % &gt; 30 % . The detailed analysis ECG resolution describe elsewhere . The core laboratory intracoronary surface ECG analysis Catholic University Rome . Contrast bidimensional echocardiography Echocontrastographic evaluation reperfusion carry day 7 . Echocontrastographic definition reflow , accord previously describe method , &gt; 25 % dysfunctioning segment reduce absent opacification ( score 2-3 ) . The technique describe elsewhere . Briefly , myocardial contrast echocardiography study perform use real-time contrast pulse sequence operate Sequoia ultrasound system ( Siemens , Malvern , Pennsylvania ) . Contrast pulse sequence novel real-time MCE method , thanks analysis non-linear response contrast bubble fundamental high harmonic , able provide image excellent signal-to-noise ratio particularly high sensitivity penetration use low mechanical index . A second-generation ultrasound contrast agent Sonovue ( Bracco , Milan , Italy ) administer intravenously ( 5 ml 1 ml/min ) . Myocardial opacification MCE visually assess 16 myocardial segment semiquantitatively score . Single perfusion score assigned basis change myocardial signal intensity throughout replenishment curve degree opacification peak contrast effect . Scores grade 1 = normal , 2 = reduce , 3 = absent opacification . A contrast score index ( CSI ) calculate sum MCE score segment divide total number segments..
