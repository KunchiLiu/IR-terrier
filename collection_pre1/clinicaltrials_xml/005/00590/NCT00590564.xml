	<brief_title>SHO-SAIKO-TO Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C : A Phase II Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis C affect nearly three million Americans . Of , 15 % develop liver cirrhosis approximately 5 % progress hepatocellular carcinoma . Treatment chronic hepatitis C limit interferon-based therapy . Many patient decline tolerate interferon serious side effect . Sho-saiko-to , Asian herbal medicine consist seven botanical , demonstrate anti-fibrotic affect inhibition lipid peroxidation hepatocytes stellate cell animal study . It also demonstrate prevent progression cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma human trial . This study single arm , single center trial Sho-saiko-to patient chronic active hepatitis hepatitis C infection tolerate specific contraindication interferon therapy . Patients receive 52 week therapy Sho-saiko-to . Outcome assess compare pre- posttreatment liver biopsy . Patients say respond improvement two point great standard measure liver histology .
