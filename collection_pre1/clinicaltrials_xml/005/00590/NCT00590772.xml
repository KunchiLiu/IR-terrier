	<brief_summary>The hypothesis leukotriene receptor antagonist ( LRA ) , montelukast , decrease nasal congestion lead increased patency nose decrease nighttime sleep fragmentation individual year round allergic rhinitis perennial allergic rhinitis ( PAR ) . This decrease sleep fragmentation reduce daytime somnolence fatigue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Montelukast Rhinitis Sleep</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Montelukast daily LRA indicate treatment allergic rhinitis asthma , safe effective . Documented improvement nasal congestion show patient seasonal perennial allergic rhinitis . As demonstrated recent publication , fully anticipate nasal congestion reduce individual afflict AR treat montelukast . We previously document decrease nasal congestion associate improved subjective sleep quality subjective improvement daytime somnolence . However , demonstrate cause effect relationship . Currently , study perform allow u assess effect nasal steroid objective sleep collecting data use traditional overnight sleep test subject congestion . We yet determine subjective instrument daytime somnolence correlate objective measurement improve daytime sleepiness . The purpose protocol three fold . First , hope determine effectiveness montelukast reduce fatigue , somnolence improve sleep , reduce nasal congestion allergic rhinitis . Two , assess statistical relation subjective instrument sleepiness . Lastly , want determine appropriate test use determine daytime sleepiness somnolence patient seasonal allergen induce congestion daytime sleepiness . We dose montelukast day , manufacturer 's suggested dosing schedule . Active drug compare placebo vehicle , mimic active drug . With proposed design study , run-in period essential ; however , establish baseline symptom adherence therapy , choose 1-week run-in placebo . After run-in , patient randomize either active drug placebo baseline questionnaires data collect . A daily diary determine symptom allergic rhinitis nighttime disturbance , well , daytime fatigue issue expect completed daily . Two week randomization , follow-up schedule order insure compliance , collect diary , administer questionnaire , start second treatment phase . After visit study subject enter 1-week wash-out return visit randomize alternative arm . At six week , subject see insure compliance administer questionnaire . The study conclude follow six-weeks . The data use analysis data collect last week randomize period . This decrease cross affect , typically see classical cross study , since short washout cross . Subjects select study history allergic rhinitis positive RAST skin test perennial ( year round ) allergen symptom correlate allergen . If prior skin test RAST available , skin test perform confirm allergic rhinitis . The patient see either Allergy , Asthma , Respiratory research center GCRC . All care study do free charge cost subject . Each subject compensate participation outline . Patients also expect fatigue , daytime somnolence poor sleep study entry . An instrument access degree fatigue , sleepiness sleep quality require positive , also must designate symptom great 50 % severity rating .</detailed_description>
