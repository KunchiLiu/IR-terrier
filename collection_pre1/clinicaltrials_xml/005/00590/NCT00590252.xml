	<brief_title>Clinical Testing New MR Pulse Sequences</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnetic resonance ( MR ) scanner use computer software , call pulse sequence , extract different type information human body . Though MR largely mature become routine clinical imaging modality , substantial development still underway order fully exploit technology . BWH Radiology leader pulse sequence development protocol review play large part development last several year . The importance development MR understate . In particular , biochemical information , detailed property water diffusion perfusion tissue , cardiac imaging , high-resolution brain imaging , hold great potential improve medical diagnosis monitoring . MR pulse sequence software typically develop small incremental step . For example , investigator may receive new state art sequence manufacturer scanner equipment . ( S ) may decide add flow-sensitizing gradient . This process straightforward , require extensive testing , first phantom in-vivo , determine pulse sequence capable perform new task , moreover , see new feature introduce undesired artifact . Some modification , like introduction diffusion-sensitizing gradient , must test patient , since change tissue diffusion observe stroke victim . Once researcher attain first goal , ( ) may proceed modification , e.g. , modification improve temporal resolution . The completion new sequence , ultimately may use large normal subject patient study , may involve large number design step , step must test one subject development proceeds . Another scenario application exist patient protocol different , exist , FDA approve equipment . For example need may arise use different radiofrequency coil ( surface coil instead head coil ) scanner system different magnetic field strength ( 3.0 Tesla instead 1.5 Tesla ) . Several parameter , signal-to-noise ratio , T1 T2 weighting may change circumstance . In case study subject reveal protocol parameter setting adequate . Therefore , protocol different conventional study , exactly protocol applied large number subject . However , protocol general procedure data handle use different scan similar enough , summarize general development protocol . The purpose protocol test validate newly develop MR pulse sequence .</detailed_description>
