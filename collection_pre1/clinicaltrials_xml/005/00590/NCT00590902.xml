	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - To measure ability OSI-774 effectively treat bronchioloalveolar cell lung cancer . - To see whether use OSI-774 provide meaningful symptomatic benefit patient advance bronchioloalveolar cell lung cancer . This study Phase II study . The first study OSI-774 do evaluate dose give patient cancer complete . The purpose research study see whether experimental treatment , call OSI-774 , cause type non-small cell lung cancer stop grow shrink . This study sponsor company call Genentech , do Memorial Hospital , well cancer center around country interested develop new drug treatment type cancer .</brief_summary>
