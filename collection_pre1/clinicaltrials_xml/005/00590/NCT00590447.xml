	<brief_summary>This phase-II trial investigate efficacy , safety tolerability sequential therapy consist 4 course single agent rituximab follow 4 course R-CHOP chemotherapy patient CD20+ posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) . However , responder rituximab achieve CR first 4 application rituximab go rituximab monotherapy receive chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The rationale perform present study combine two highly active treatment modality first line therapy solid organ recipient B-cell PTLD . The monoclonal antibody CD20 represent effective therapeutic approach treatment PTLD . Unfortunately effect seem limited duration patient , benefit monotherapy rituximab . The advantage therapeutic approach PTLD due low incidence third fourth degree adverse event . At diagnosis PTLD relevant proportion patient suitable first line cytotoxic chemotherapy due widespread disease , organ dysfunction reduce performance state . Insufficiencies kidney bone marrow function frequent organ recipient due toxic side effect immunosuppressive drug . After pre-phase treatment monoclonal antibody rituximab CHOP chemotherapy suggest less toxic due low tumor burden . Thereby treatment relate severe even lethal toxicity , frequently report patient PTLD underwent cytotoxic chemotherapy , may prevent . Furthermore total number cytotoxic cycle CHOP-therapy reduce 6 8 4 cycle thus may result additional reduction toxicity single patient . Because immunochemotherapy ( R-CHOP ) clearly superior CHOP respect progression free survival relapse rate patient classical NHL rituximab unlikely add toxicity CHOP majority patient go four course R-CHOP . However , patient complete remission 4 course single agent rituximab may favourable risk profile therefore go rituximab single agent instead R-CHOP .</detailed_description>
