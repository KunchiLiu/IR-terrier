	<brief_summary>Subjects eligible study irregular heartbeat call atrial fibrillation ( AF ) schedule procedure involve apply electrical energy pulmonary vein , usually site abnormal rhythm begin , pulmonary vein ablation We examine size function leave atrium ( one 4 chamber heart ) pulmonary vein ablation . This do get extra measurement test do ICE ( intra cardiac echocardiography ) , TEE ( transesophageal echocardiography ) CT scan ( computed tomography ) , draw blood sample . The purpose get extra measurement blood sample : 1. see whether TEE measurement do ablation tell u atrial fibrillation may come back ablation ; 2. see TEE measurement look different ablation ; 3. see blood test tell u atrial fibrillation may come back ablation ; 4. look often pulmonary vein narrow find TEE compare often find CT scan . During clinically indicated test doctor order ( TEE , ICE , CT scan ) , additional measurement take part research . This mean TEE exam last additional 10-15 minute , ICE procedure last additional 5-10 minute . There additional time need CT scan . In addition , draw 20 cc blood ( approximately four teaspoon ) . The regularly schedule follow visit usually three month ablation , get extra measurement TEE CT scan . This add 10-15 minute TEE test , additional time need CT scan . In addition , draw 10 cc blood drawn ( approximately two teaspoon ) . A ventilation-perfusion scan lung also perform part standard clinical care significant PV stenosis find CT and/or TEE .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims 1 . Examine structure function leave atrium , leave atrial appendage pulmonary vein ablation . 2 . Compare findings transesophageal echo intracardiac echo . 3 . Detect incidence pulmonary vein stenosis assess transesophageal echo compare computed tomography . 4 . Assess physiological predictor recurrence atrial fibrillation base echocardiography . 5 . Determine whether biological marker B-type natriuretic peptide C-reactive protein predict recurrence atrial fibrillation . 6 . Assess marker coagulation D-dimer prothrombin factor 1.2 increase atrial fibrillation could predict thromboembolic risk . General Procedures Prior ablation , blood drawn measure c-reactive protein , brain natriuretic polypeptide , D-dimer prothrombin fragment 1.2 . A transesopahegeal echocardiogram intracardiac echocardiogram perform . Then follow sterile technique , standard catheter pass vein position heart use X-ray guidance , cross wall divide upper chamber heart leave atrium reached.The catheter use trigger sit originate anomalous rhythm identify generator deliver radiofrequency energy destroy area cause irregular beat . After ablation follow-up visit do one , three , six twelve month . During time several test electrocardiograms , 24 hour Holter recording , compute tomography heart , transesophageal echocardiogram repeat blood draw measure c-reactive protein , brain natriuretic peptide , D-dimer prothrombin fragment 1.2 do .</detailed_description>
