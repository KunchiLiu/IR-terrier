	<detailed_description>Background Clinical Significance : Colorectal cancer continue carry significant burden morbidity mortality twenty-first century , despite availability multiple screen modality . It estimate approximately 150,000 new case CRC diagnose 50,000 people die CRC 2006 ( 1 ) . Current option screen CRC include fecal occult-blood testing , flexible sigmoidoscopy , double contrast barium enema , colonoscopy . While randomize controlled trial show mortality benefit screen colonoscopy , become preferred method screen surveillance polyp ability visualize entire colon addition ability remove polyp . This procedure associate risk include perforation bleed polypectomy . Other major complication also report , include MI CVA . Although guideline exist colorectal cancer screen surveillance polyp , define upper age limit practice carry ( 2,3 ) . No clear data available effect procedure life expectancy age 80 . Also , country limit resource screen colonoscopy may offer likely benefit . Based fact , real need quantify prevalence colon neoplasia age group guide primary care physician well gastroenterologist offer screen surveillance colonoscopy age group . Like many medical decision , cancer screening require weigh quantitative information , risk cancer death likelihood beneficial adverse screening outcome , well qualitative factor , individual patient ' value preference . In fact , patient life expectancy less 5 year unlikely derive survival benefit cancer screen . There also potential harm screening procedure . Some great harm screen occur detecting cancer would never become clinically significant . This become likely life expectancy decrease . As population age life expectancy continue increase , elderly patient refer colonoscopy . What utility perform colonoscopy asymptomatic patient , safe ? Few study examine question adequately . What follow brief review publish data regard yield safety colonoscopy elderly . Yield : Lin et al examine prevalence neoplasia 1244 screening colonoscopy - 63 patient old 80 . They find although prevalence neoplasia increase age ( 28.6 % patient older 80 ) , gain expect life expectancy intervention limit ( 4 ) . Cooper et al come somewhat different conclusion ( 7 ) . They analyze 1.8 million Medicare patient colonoscopy 1999 use ICD-9 code rate polyp detection ( pathology examine , clear percentage patient hyperplastic polyp , adenoma , advance adenoma , cancer ) . They find rate polyp detection decrease age still high ( range 15.2-31.3 % patient older 80 ) . Cooper previously show incidence colorectal cancer increase age analysis new case colon cancer Medicare patient 19878 . Similarly , National Polyp Study show increase incidence high grade dysplasia patient older 60 ( 9 ) . Finally , VA Cooperative Study Group No . 380 prospective cross sectional study 3121 asymptomatic patient 1994-1997 find prevalence advance neoplasia associate risk factor . 329 patient find advanced neoplasia define adenoma great 1 cm , villous histology , presence high-grade dysplasia , cancer . Associations find advanced neoplasia family history CRC , smoking , moderate heavy alcohol consumption , fiber intake , use daily NSAIDS vitamin D11 . Safety : Two study discuss safety colonoscopy elderly patient . Duncan find 8 major complication ( 0.6 % ) include 3 bleeds 1 perforation series 1199 colonoscopies6 . Sardinha also report low rate major bleeding ( 0.2 % ) perforation 428 colonoscopy ; compare favorably two study elderly patients.10 Gatto et al take random sample Medicare patient underwent colonoscopy 1991 1998 . 39,286 colonoscopy identify CPT-4 code ; perforation within 7 day procedure identify ICD-9 code . The average age 74 , 21 % patient old 80 . The overall incidence perforation 0.19 % ; author find rate perforation increase age number comorbidities12,13 . In addition perforation bleeding , MI CVA also report colonoscopy . Cappell study patient already high risk MI CVA . He look 100 patient underwent colonoscopy within 30 day MI compare 100 control patient without MI unstable angina precede 6 month . He find high rate minor complication ( transient asymptomatic hypotension bradycardia ) study group ( patient sicker overall ) , one major complication colonoscopy probably due procedure13 . Importance Current Research Veterans : The prevalence CRC approximately 5 % ( 1,3 ) . Although 80 % case sporadic ( remain result inflammatory bowel disease hereditary colon cancer syndrome ) , many veteran one risk factor CRC include advance age , smoking , heavy alcohol intake , high fat low fiber diet , sedentary lifestyle , obesity . As veteran population age , preventative service continue important part health care . As US population aging , US veteran population . This complicate fact recent study examine self-rated health function national sample veteran age 65 old report one-half elderly veteran report difficulty function rat health status fair poor ( 14 ) . This group veterans may also live alone , may easy access transportation health facility may find physically challenge prepare colon cleanse agent good exam colonoscopy . Age comorbidity also affect survival rate resection colorectal cancer . A study Ko et al use nationwide data healthcare cost utilization program calculate mortality among 22,000 resection colon cancer15 . They find besides volume surgery , two factor affect post colon cancer mortality age comorbid disease ( i.e . cardiovascular , pulmonary liver disease ) ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Another study 80 patient ( 16 ) , 80 year old , show postoperative mortality rate 8 % 5yr survival 23 % . Only 13 patient live longer 5 year . Many elderly people may need coronary revascularization procedure plan surgery , colon cancer discover . Older age associate adverse outcome patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention . A study National Heart , Lung Blood Institute include 4620 PCI treat patient report adjusted relative risk elderly ( &gt; 80 year ) compare young ( &lt; 65 year ) patient higher inhospital relate death ( 3.64 versus 1.0 ) well myocardial infarction ( 2.57 versus 1.0 ) ( 17 ) . Based data , useful necessary know potential risk benefit invasive procedure otherwise asymptomatic elderly patient . Methods : Study Design : Computerized medical record endoscopy report search identify patient older 80 year old underwent colonoscopy indicate average risk screen colon cancer surveillance polyp . A control group patient age 50 79 also identify underwent colonoscopy indicate average risk screen colon cancer surveillance polyp . The ratio control study patient 2 1 . Records search 1997 July 31 , 2006 . Data collect include age time colonoscopy , sex , body mass index , personal history CAD , DM , CVA , PVD , endoscopic histologic finding colonoscopy , evidence complete examination , complication colonoscopy , evidence complication colonoscopy include perforation , bleeding , MI , CVA . The use aspirin , NSAIDS , calcium , vitamin D record . A comprehensive questionnaire include information diet , exercise , family history , smoking , alcohol consumption , use aspirin , NSAIDS , calcium , vitamin D , statins administered endoscopist prior colonoscopy . Risk Benefit Study Participant : The participant active prospective portion study . Their participation limit completion write survey . This give verbal inform consent . There risk study participant . Benefits study previously address detail section title `` Importance Current Research Veterans '' . Data Collection : Patient demographic , endoscopy pathology finding , procedure complication , comorbidities data regard various risk factor smoke , alcohol intake , lack dietary fruit vegetable , lack exercise , family history , prior history colon cancer , ASA , NSAID statin use collect . A questionnaire factor outline administered endoscopist . The data transfer Excel spreadsheet one study investigator . Statistical Power Data Analysis : Using SPSS software , prevalence colon polyp colon cancer group age &gt; 80 year &lt; 80 year compare . Significant polyp define polyp &gt; 1 cm size , polyps villous histology , three polyp polyps dysplasia . Hyperplastic polyp consider non-neoplastic . Smokers define people smoke least 1 pack per day 10 year quit smoke past 10 year . Associations clinical demographic variable examine use Spearman 's correlation coefficient . Univariate analysis perform Chi-square fisher 's exact test categorical variable Wilcoxon sum test continuous variable . A multivariate logistic regression perform control covariates may affect prevalence colonic neoplasia . All test two-tailed . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
