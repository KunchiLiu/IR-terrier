	<brief_summary>Patients blockage blood vessel supply blood back brain , know vertebrobasilar disease ( VBD ) , risk stroke temporary symptom stroke know transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) . The risk repeat stroke associate VBD may affect several risk factor , include degree blockage reduces blood flow brain . Patients VBD different level blockage range partial blockage complete blockage , affect blood flow brain variable amount . The purpose research determine patient symptomatic VBD demonstrate low blood flow back brain magnetic resonance ( MR ) image high risk develop another stroke TIA patient normal blood flow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approximately 700,000 stroke occur annually U.S. make third leading cause death lead cause permanent disability among adult . Over one third stroke occur posterior circulation , lead cause vertebrobasilar occlusive disease secondary atherosclerosis . Symptomatic vertebrobasilar disease ( VBD ) carry high annual risk stroke , average 10-15 % per year despite medical therapy . This represent potentially treatable high risk stroke etiology . Advances endovascular angioplasty stenting create new treatment option , intervention carry significant risk , selection criterion appropriate candidate remain uncertain . Determining predictor stroke population first step toward identify high risk patient suitable consideration intervention . Our preliminary study suggest risk stroke VBD strongly relate extent intracranial blood flow compromise . The objective conduct longitudinal study patient symptomatic VBD . Our central hypothesis patient symptomatic VBD demonstrate limitation blood flow quantitative magnetic resonance angiography ( QMRA ) high risk stroke.The primary aim proposal test hypothesis among patient VBD , distal blood flow compromise high risk subsequent posterior circulation stroke normal flow . Secondary exploratory aim proposal determine : correlation large vessel flow measure QMRA tissue level perfusion measure MR perfusion posterior circulation , predictive value ; predictive factor stroke population ; hemodynamic effect vary degree vertebrobasilar stenosis ; change hemodynamic status patient medical therapy time ; utility QMRA non-invasive screen monitoring tool VBD . The study consist prospective multi-center observational cohort study patient symptomatic angiographically confirm vertebrobasilar atherostenosis ( ≥ 50 % ) , occlusion ) . Upon enrollment , patient undergo hemodynamic assessment noninvasive MR imaging ( include QMRA MR perfusion ) , result keep blinded treating physician patient . Patients prospectively designate demonstrate compromise normal distal cerebral flow base upon exist validated algorithm individual posterior circulation vessel flow measurement . Baseline demographic , clinical laboratory data gather . Subsequently , patient monthly clinical follow-up re-imaged QMRA 6 month interval minimum 12 month . The primary endpoint stroke incidence vertebrobasilar territory one year . Survival analysis method , censor patient achieve endpoint end study period , use comparison patient compromise versus normal blood flow . The overall goal study define population patient symptomatic VBD high risk recurrent ischemic event . The information gain significantly impact selection criterion likelihood success future clinical trial aim assess efficacy endovascular surgical intervention treatment VBD . Moreover , ability define low risk population risk expensive invasive intervention would unnecessary equally important impact management disease clinical cost perspective . Data regard hemodynamic effect change time vertebrobasilar occlusive disease may also enhance understand basic pathophysiology mechanism stroke morbid disease entity .</detailed_description>
