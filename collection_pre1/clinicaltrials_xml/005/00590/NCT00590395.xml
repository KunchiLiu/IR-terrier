	<brief_title>FDG-PET/CT Evaluation Patients With Suspected Cholecystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIDA scintigraphy nuclear medicine scan use evaluate patient suspect acute cholecystitis ( infection/inflammation gallbladder ) . Because indirect test look obstruction cystic duct structure , many cause false-positive HIDA study . There need sensitive specific test accurately assess gallbladder infection and/or inflammation . The purpose study determine effectiveness FDG direct mean detect patient acute cholecystitis . FDG image agent previously show accumulate area infection and/or inflammation . The location intensity FDG accumulation body detect camera system call `` positron emission tomography '' ( PET ) camera . In theory , test effective detect acute infection and/or inflammation gallbladder . Consenting participant receive injection FDG one hour prior FDG-PET/CT examination . The participant image use PET/CT machine , special camera system capable perform PET CT scan time . A CT scan anatomical image test , research study , mainly use localize area 18FDG accumulation record PET scan . The examination take approximately one hour .</detailed_description>
