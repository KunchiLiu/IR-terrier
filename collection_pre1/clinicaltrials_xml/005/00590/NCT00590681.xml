	<brief_summary>This study conduct help determine whether addition Avastin ( anti-cancer drug ) , give along temozolomide monthly cycle follow radiation , able delay tumor growth , shrink tumor , impact long people GBM live . This study sponsor Genentech , Inc. , manufacturer Avastin . Avastin experimental drug administer research study . Avastin bind protein call vascular endothelial growth factor , VEGF . VEGF produce tumor circulates blood . One VEGF 's main role support growth new blood vessel . During cancer , VEGF promote growth blood vessel bring nutrient tumor cell help grow . Avastin bind VEGF , prevent VEGF functioning . In laboratory study , Avastin prevent growth several different type cancer cell grown animal . Avastin approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment metastatic colorectal cancer combination chemotherapy . Avastin approve FDA treatment GBM , therefore , consider experimental . Avastin currently undergo test ( alone combination another anti-cancer drug , irinotecan ) person GBM come back conventional treatment . Temozolomide ( Temodar ) anti-cancer drug work interfere growth cell ( include cancer cell ) stop division . Temozolomide approve U.S. FDA treatment newly diagnose GBM 2005 . Avastin temozolomide currently use together several research study involve people newly diagnose GBM . Limited information available either safety effectiveness drug combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Temozolomide Following Radiation Chemotherapy Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist follow : 1 ) screening period 28 day ; 2 ) treatment period radiation daily temozolomide last approximately 6 week , 3 ) study treatment period last either tumor grows experience unacceptable side effect ; 4 ) 30-day follow-up period treatment end . Additionally , basic information concern condition collect every 2 month follow-up period rest life . During study , Dr. Nicholas research team collect information purpose research . This include name , address , date ( i.e. , date birth , date consent ) , telephone number , medical record number . Slides tumor tissue use diagnose GBM send pathologist confirm diagnosis GBM . After review complete slide return hospital provide . Preserved sample tumor also send test determine effective temozolomide might case . Any remain tissue return hospital provide . Screening phase ( follow diagnosis GBM surgery ) To determine eligible participate study , undergo screen process involve follow - Assessment cancer magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain use intravenous ( vein ) contrast material - Recording general medical , surgical cancer history - Physical examination , include measurement blood pressure , height weight - Evaluation performance status ( ability carry daily activity ) - Neurologic examination ( well nerve muscle work ) - Blood sample laboratory test ( approximately 2 3 tablespoon ) evaluate blood count , liver , kidney function - Serum pregnancy test woman childbearing potential - Urine sample - Recording medication take within past 14 day Radiation daily temozolomide chemotherapy You begin radiation treatment within 5 week surgery . You take temozolomide orally daily ( seven day week ) radiation treatment ( occur Monday - Friday last approximately six week ) . You take medication prevent rare form pneumonia ( pneumocystis carinii ) occur temozolomide give daily basis . That may either pill form inhale . During radiation treatment see every two week study doctor time ask tolerating treatment . A physical examination , ( include neurological evaluation ) , perform . Blood test ( 1-2 tablespoon ) perform assure side-effects chemotherapy . Post-radiation treatment Two four week complete radiation brain MRI scan . Beginning four week radiation end , study drug temozolomide begin . The study drug ( Avastin ) administer IV infusion ( vein ) every 2 week . Temozolomide take orally five consecutive day every 28 day . In word , receive two intravenous infusion Avastin five day temozolomide every 28 day . This constitute treatment cycle . These cycle continue indefinitely . The dose Avastin base upon weight screen remain throughout study . The temozolomide dose radiation base height weight screen . During study phase , temozolomide dose accord height weight begin treatment cycle . The dose may delay four week blood count low . If temozolomide still give blood count low longer four week , temozolomide stop Avastin may still continue . Your first dose Avastin give 90 minute . If tolerate 90 minute infusion well , infusion future may give short period time . However , tolerate short infusion time , future infusion give long period previously tolerate . If experience problem follow infusion , monitor trained staff consider safe leave . The dose Avastin receive may stop slow base well tolerate treatment . If must stop treatment unfavorable side effect , may able restart treatment side effect improve resolve . Your doctor discus whether best interest continue treatment . If stop study drug treatment , continue return evaluate explain . Temozolomide take bedtime empty stomach ( least 2 hour meal ) . Prior dose temozolomide , take anti-nausea pill ( ondansetron , granisetron , dolasetron ) reduce nausea vomit . The treatment cycle describe continue : 1 ) tumor grows , 2 ) unacceptable side effect , 3 ) choose withdraw research study , 4 ) participation end Dr. Nicholas Genentech . During first treatment day 28 day cycle receive Avastin . Your blood pressure monitor , physical examination , neurologic examination , evaluation performance status ( well function daily activity ) . On day , begin temozolomide chemotherapy . You blood sample drawn laboratory test ( approximately 2-3 tablespoon ) , urine sample take . You ask study doctor health problem medication take . Additional blood sample may draw discretion doctor part standard care . On day 14 every treatment cycle return clinic receive infusion Avastin . At time , blood pressure take , physical examination evaluation performance status . On day 21 cycle blood work ( 1-2 tablespoon ) see well tolerate treatment . Every 8 week ( every 2 cycle immediately prior next cycle ) MRI brain determine measurement tumor .</detailed_description>
