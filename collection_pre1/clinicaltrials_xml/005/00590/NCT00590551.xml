	<detailed_description>Preventing development pressure wound patient prevent staff injury safe work environment ongoing effort Christiana Care Health System ( CCHS ) . Skin damage hospitalize patient devastate . Not increase patient 's hospital stay , also cause pain affect patient quality life subsequently cost . One practice prevention treatment wound use pressure reducing , relieve pressure redistribution surface ( mattress ) reposition device ( electric lift ) . Manufacturers mattress emphasize need limit layer surface ( mattress ) patient . Safe work environment focus program help ensure prevention work related injury . Injury prevention program focus equipment eliminate manual lift effort decrease staff injuries patient transfer reposition . Part practice leave sling patient order reduce amount time staff manually reposition turn patient . With increase patient population either obese extremely obese ( bariatric patient ) position lift equipment need manage large weight limit . In response , manufacturer construct sling increase fabric strength handle heavier patient . There concern new sling fabric may interfere low airloss pressure redistribution purpose mattress . Information study may help make sling material support high weight cause add skin problem . A convenience sample 240 adult patient meeting study criterion recruit inpatient unit Wilmington Hospitaland Christiana Hospital comparison study . After obtain informed consent , subject randomize member study team one six group , yield 40 subject per group . Groups assign follow - Supine sling - 30 degree HOB ( Head bed ) elevation without leg elevation sling - 30 degree HOB elevation 10 degree leg elevation sling - Supine without sling - 30 degree HOB elevation without leg elevation without sling - 30 degree HOB elevation 10 degree leg elevation without sling Study Methodology Staff nurse identify patient need use sling transfer reposition contact research team . A member research team determine patient eligibility , obtain informed consent , collect demographic information - age - height - weight - BMI , ( Body Mass Index ) - gender - race - Braden score , list risk factor determine potential skin breakdown - diagnosis - activity level Once consent , patient sacral skin temperature skin pH measure use thermometer nitrazine paper control measurement temperature pH take anterior thigh . The X sensor pressure mapping system , place directly patient patient randomize sling group . For patient randomize sling group , sling place X sensor patient . The use incontinence pad , etc . need , limited one note data collection tool . Pressure mapping , temperature pH record one minute baseline 20 minute . Pressure map sacral area record include high , low average measurement . Data Analysis The propose study three dependent variable : - pressure - temperature - pH . All three dependent variable ratio scale measure . The goal study test null hypothesis three dependent variable equal among six condition . Subjects randomly assign six condition . Each dependent variable collect twice . Therefore , study incorporate one subject factor , condition one within subject factor , time period . The subject factor six level within subject factor two level . The traditional approach analyze data propose research design univariate , repeat measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) . Increasingly , random effect RE model employ data repeat measure design ( Hedeker &amp; Gibbons , 1997 Singer Willett , 2003 ) . RE model offer two important advantage ANOVA , ( Raudenbush Bryk , 2002 ) . First , unequal sample size occurs miss data present difficulty impose ANOVA . Second , easy specify complex model include multiple random effect . The propose research model straightforward two time period data collect . In instance , third alternative available : multivariate repeat measure ANOVA ( Tabachnick &amp; Fidell , 2006 ) . Like RE model , multivariate approach robust violation sphericity assumption ( Stevens , 2002 ) . Unlike RE model , analysis straight forward result interpret accord traditional ANOVA convention , time effect , group effect , group time interaction , make understandable wide audience ( Maxwell Delaney 2004 ) . Consequently , data propose study analyze use multivariate repeat measure ANOVA . A priori power estimate three , multivariate repeat measure ANOVA dependent variable study . The proposed analysis use two tail alpha level set .05 . Overall power set .80 , mean study 80 percent probability find significant difference difference exist population . Equal sample size assume . The power analysis concentrate multivariate group time interaction usually least powerful element repeat measure ANOVA ( Field , 2005 Wickens Keppel , 2004 ) . A medium effect size anticipate Cohens 1988 f = .25 . In addition , drop rate 20 percent expect . Results show overall sample size 240 require , 40 subject per group . This sample size select small sample would important detect .</detailed_description>
