	<detailed_description>The primary hypothesis , initial 150 mg eq . load dose deltoid muscle follow either deltoid gluteal injection patient schizophrenia , paliperidone palmitate ( 25 , 100 , 150 mg eq . ) superior placebo measure change Positive Negative Syndrome Scale Schizophrenia ( PANSS ) total score 13-week period.This randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , multicenter , dose-response study men woman Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ) diagnosis schizophrenia . The secondary objective : Assess benefit personal social functioning ( key secondary endpoint ) associate use paliperidone palmitate compare placebo , Assess global improvement severity illness associate use paliperidone palmitate compare placebo , Assess dose-response exposure-response relationship paliperidone palmitate The study include screening period 7 day 13 week double-blind treatment period . The screening period include washout disallow psychotropic medication . Subjects without source documentation previous exposure least 2 dos oral risperidone , paliperidone ER , one dose i.m . RISPERDAL CONSTA , paliperidone palmitate give 4 6 day paliperidone ER 6 mg/day tolerability test . Patients source documentation previous exposure medication currently take another antipsychotic regimen continue current treatment Day -1 . At begin double-blind treatment period , subject randomly assign equal number 1 4 treatment group ( initial load dose 150 mg eq . paliperidone palmitate give deltoid injection follow 3 fix i.m . dose paliperidone palmitate [ 25 , 100 , 150 mg eq . ] Days 8 , 36 , 64 placebo give manner ) . Note : The choice injection site ( deltoid gluteal ) remain injection initial load dose discretion investigator . The entire study , include screen period , last approximately 14 weeks.Samples pharmacokinetic ( PK ) evaluation collect designated time point . Effectiveness safety evaluate periodically throughout study . A pharmacogenomic blood sample ( 10 mL ) collect patient give separate write informed consent part study ( local regulation permit ) . This allow pharmacogenomic research , necessary . Participation pharmacogenomic research optional . Approximately 105 115 mL whole blood collect study . Patients randomly assign paliperidone palmitate receive i.m . injection paliperidone palmitate ( 150 mg eq . deltoid injection paliperidone palmitate Day 1 , follow 25 , 100 , 150 mg eq . paliperidone palmitate i.m . Days 8 , 36 , 64 ) . Patients randomly assign placebo receive deltoid injection placebo Day 1 follow placebo Days 8 , 36 , 64 .</detailed_description>
