Aortic atheroma also show associate atrial fibrillation , aortic valve sclerosis , calcification fibrous skeleton heart . None previous study look noninvasive prediction aortic atheroma use history physical sign cardiovascular disease . This would time cost-effective bedside diagnostic tool would useful prior cardiac surgery , cardiac catheterization , workup ischemic stroke patient , especially transesophageal echocardiogram ( TEE ) consider diagnosis obtain due previously mention reason . Although physical examination peripheral vascular disease non-specific , combination physical examination sign increase probability generalize atherosclerosis .</brief_summary>
