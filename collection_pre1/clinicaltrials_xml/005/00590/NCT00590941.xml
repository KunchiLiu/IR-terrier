	<brief_title>Genetic Determinations Side Effects Response Rate Patients Receiving Chemotherapy With Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon enrollment study , patient blood sample collected genotyping FCGR3A gene ( immunoglobulin Fc G receptor IIIa ) , ABCB1 gene ( ATP Binding Cassette Beta 1 ; also call MDR1 ) , candidate gene . Patients treat R-CHOP six cycle , standard therapy advance stage DLCL . Response monitor FDG-PET scan perform 2 cycle R-CHOP restaging exam perform upon completion chemotherapy . Gene polymorphisms analyze establish polymorphism predict response R-CHOP .</detailed_description>
