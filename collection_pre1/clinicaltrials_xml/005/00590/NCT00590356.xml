	<brief_title>Star-Close Versus Angio-Seal Femoral Artery Hemostasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The grow success intervention requirement day case outpatient procedure lead concomitant rise use arteriotomy closure device ( ACD ) achieve hemostasis allow early mobilization follow arterial puncture . ACD emerge alternative traditional mechanical compression percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . When compare manual compression , several study confirm patient comfort , reduce time achieve hemostasis , reduce time ambulation , early discharge . Recently , CLIP Trial conduct evaluated safety efficacy StarClose device subject undergoing diagnostic interventional catheterization procedure . A total 17 U.S. site enrol 596 subject , 483 subject randomize 2:1 ratio receive StarClose standard compression arteriotomy percutaneous procedure . The study include roll-in ( n=113 ) , diagnostic ( n=208 ) , interventional ( n=275 ) arm primary safety endpoint major vascular complication 30 day primary efficacy endpoint postprocedure time hemostasis . This trial demonstrate StarClose Vascular Closure System noninferior manual compression respect primary safety endpoint major vascular event subject undergo percutaneous interventional procedure . StarClose significantly reduce time hemostasis , ambulation , dischargeability compare compression . However , study randomly compare two closure device . Therefore , study design evaluate efficacy safety Starclose ( Abbott Vascular Devices ) femoral access site closure patient undergo PCI compare Angio-Seal STS Plus ( St. Jude Medical ) .</detailed_description>
