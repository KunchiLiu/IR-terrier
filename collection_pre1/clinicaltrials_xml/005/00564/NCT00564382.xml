	<brief_summary>In study , investigate role Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging patient suspect , yet prove , `` acute cardiac syndrome ACS '' . Patients include presented local Emergency Department chest pain , first test Emergency Department negative clearly indicative cardiac ischemia . For example , first lab value Troponin T negative borderline elevate ; first ECG clearly indicative ischemia . The standard procedure patient wait 4-6 hour repeat test ; continue negative , patient discharge home , become positive , invasive coronary artery angiography perform . We think , CMR study shorten time need make decision either `` discharge '' `` admit CCU perform coronary artery angiography '' . CMR show gold standard heart function ( thus , see even subtle wall motion abnormality ) , tissue characterization ( so-called T2-weighted image identify tissue edema ( swell ) ; perfusion image identify area reduce blood supply ; late enhancement image safely identify fibrotic irreversibly damage tissue ) even use stress patient exclude critical non-critical narrowing coronary artery . The primary endpoint study impact CMR time-to-decision patient . It possible ) identify patient WITH acute infarct CMR send cath lab sooner compare wait second test ; b ) identify patient WITHOUT acute infarct c ) perform stress test patient exclude severe coronary artery disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Unstable angina ( UA ) non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) serious form acute coronary syndromes1 . They require rapid clinical assessment , diagnosis therapeutical intervention . A delay diagnosis delay treatment may lead serious complication ventricular arrhythmia , heart failure sudden cardiac death . In NSTEMI , time delay diagnosis might lead irreversible loss salvageable myocardium . The current recommendation American Heart Association management patient UA/ NSTEMI rely patient 's symptom , ECG change serum marker ( Troponin ) 1 . The algorithm diagnosis therapy straight-forward patient present positive Troponin and/ ongoing ECG change ; however , 8 hour delay occur patient present chest pain , without diagnostic ECG change negative Troponins ( figure 1 ) . During period , repeat ECGs recommend observe change , Troponin test repeat 8 hour . This delay diagnosis treatment might abbreviate diagnosis UA/NSTEMI help cardiac MRI . A grow body evidence support capability MRI diagnose rule UA/ NSTEMI : In 2003 , Kwong et al could show CMR high sensitivity specificity detect acute coronary syndrome Emergency Room , also strong predictor acute coronary syndrome compare ECG , Troponin TIMI risk score ≥3 . The method appear suitable triage patient present chest pain Emergency Room ; also find safe2 . In another study , Plein et al find CMR could useful diagnose coronary artery disease high sensitivity specificity patient present Emergency Room chest pain3 . Furthermore , recently show patient present ER chest pain , negative Troponin test exclude acute coronary syndrome , adenosine stress CMR study powerful predictor adverse outcomes positive perfusion deficit , powerful negative predictor perfusion deficit found4 . CMR visualize irreversible myocardial injury , even lesion affect little less 2 gram myocardial tissue5 . Our data show CMR accurate tool diagnose acute myocardial infarct , T2-weighted image detection acute edema use conjunction image irreversible injury6 ; also show irreversible myocardial injury detect soon 1 hour infarction7 . Although show CMR diagnose UA/ NSTEMI2 , 3 well rule excellent negative predictive prognostic value4 , show whether CMR lead shorten time-to-diagnosis . It also study yet , whether incorporation CMR diagnostic pathway would cost-efficient . Hypothesis : Cardiac MRI shorten time diagnosis acute coronary syndrome patient present differential diagnosis UA/NSTEMI , initial ECG Troponin test non-diagnostic . The implementation CMR diagnostic pathway cost efficient . Methods : We examine patient admit ER chest pain suggestive first acute coronary syndrome . If initial ECG Troponin test inconclusive patient suppose wait second Troponin test , urgent CMR study perform diagnose UA/NSTEMI ( see figure 2 ) . The time measure initial Troponin test second decisive Troponin test ( control variable ) . The time well measure first Troponin test result CMR test ( test variable ) . In patient negative CMR study , CMR study extend stress perfusion study , time measure first negative Troponin result stress test ( test variable ) . In patient second Troponin return negative , conventional stress test schedule diagnostic work-up ( independent CMR test ) , time first Troponin result stress test measure . The CMR study perform assess 1 . LV function ( global regional function ) 2 . Myocardial edema 3 . Myocardial perfusion rest 4 . Myocardial infarction 5 . If show pathological result : adenosine stress perfusion The follow protocol use CMR study : - Localizer - LV function multiple long axes - T2w STIR 3 short axis view - BOLD study 3 short-axis view - Rest perfusion study 3 long axes 1 short axis view - Late enhancement study - If show pathological result : stress perfusion study adenosine 3 long axes 1 short axis view The study rat positive Acute Coronary Syndrome one follow present : - Regional wall motion abnormality ( presence late enhancement : regional wall motion abnormality conjunction positive STIR , regional wall motion abnormality exceed area late enhancement ) - Regional myocardial edema STIR image - Regional perfusion deficit ( presence late enhancement : regional perfusion deficit exceed area late enhancement ) - If perform : stress-induced perfusion deficit The CMR study positive coronary artery disease , without Acute Coronary Syndrome , follow criterion meet : - Late enhancement without correspond high signal STIR , without regional wall motion abnormality correspond exceed area late enhancement Inclusion criterion study : 1 . 18+ year age , informed consent obtain 2 .
