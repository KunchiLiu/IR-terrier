	<brief_summary>Summary : The investigator aim identify marker right ventricular dysfunction patient severe pulmonary regurgitation follow repair Tetralogy Fallot , allow prediction optimal timing replacement regurgitant valve . The investigator use MR gold-standard reference measurement cardiac function rest dobutamine stress . The investigator also evaluate predictive potential tissue Doppler imaging patient group . Purpose : To predict optimum timing pulmonary valve replacement severe regurgitation repair Tetralogy Fallot use Cardiac Magnetic resonance dobutamine stress testing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiac Function Under Stress Early Detection Right Ventricular Insufficiency After Repair Tetralogy Fallot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tetralogy Fallot ( ToF ) single commonest complex cardiac condition . It consist ventricular septal defect ( VSD ) , override aorta association VSD , pulmonary stenosis right ventricular ( RV ) hypertrophy . Surgical repair indicate significantly improve life-expectancy . The result surgical repair improve steadily last 40 year result significant population survive young adulthood . However , standard repair technique induce regurgitation pulmonary valve due relief right ventricular outflow tract obstruction . Over time regurgitation induces right ventricular dilatation dysfunction . RV dilatation dysfunction correlate reduce exercise tolerance , arrhythmia , sudden death follow repair . Replacement pulmonary valve , late primary repair ToF , generally show improve symptom measure NYHA classification improve haemodynamics , exercise tolerance dysrhythmia . Though generally safe , surgical replacement pulmonary valve expose patient cardio-pulmonary by-pass , may detrimental effect myocardium brain . Furthermore transplanted valve various type limited life span thus early repair pulmonary valve may instigate series re-operations , recur throughout patient 's life expose cumulative risk morbidity mortality . Unfortunately evidence literature symptomatic improvement reduce pulmonary valve replacement delay long . This probably due irreversible myocardial damage little remodel RV despite competent pulmonary valve . In light two oppose factor ; potential failure recover avoid multiple operation need establish preoperative marker allow identification fail ventricle pass point recovery . This allow close follow-up intervention time minimize loss function whilst take account likely need re-operation . However , still unclear , criterion give best indication need re-interventions . Two study Competence Network Congenital Heart Defects ( `` Follow Post-Repair Tetralogy Fallot ( HP 4.1 ) '' `` Early re-intervention infant small child correction Tetralogy Fallot : Prospective analysis myocardial benefit use cardiac MRI echocardiography ( HP 4.2 ) '' analyze benefit re-interventions hopefully provide substantive information timing PVR . There however reference literature cardiac imaging procedure stress possibly result sensitive predictive parameter right ventricular insufficiency conduct rest . Dobutamine stress test long history safe clinically useful application ischemic cardiomyopathy recent study demonstrate 's useful predictive value various outcome non-ischemic cardiomyopathy . Accurate post-operative characterization allow identification pre-operative predictive marker . The investigator believe dobutamine stress test may fact excellent predictive marker . Dobutamine increase intrinsic contractability well reduce load . It think fail heart able positively respond dobutamine stimulus , dobutamine stress thus demonstrate evidence irreversible damage . Identification predictive marker point irreversible myocardial damage occur allow well time pulmonary valve replacement significant ramification management patient group . In study imaging procedure ( MRI echocardiography ) rest stress ( dobutamine ) compare pulmonary valve replacement severe pulmonary insufficiency repair Tetralogy Fallot , whereas imaging procedure echocardiography stress optional . The data obtain suppose determine new parameter early right ventricular insufficiency . The investigator correlate objective data subjective data change symptom exercise capacity pre- post-repair . Fallot patient good result repair good right ventricular function serve comparison group .</detailed_description>
