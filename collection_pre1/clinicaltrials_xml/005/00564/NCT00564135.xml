	<brief_title>Postoperative Urinary Retention Urinary Track Infection ( UTI ) After Laparoscopic Assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy ( LAVH ) Benign Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hysterectomy common major gynecological operation perform ; previous study , 20 % woman undergone hysterectomy age 50 year , mostly nonmalignant condition uterine fibroid , endometriosis , abnormal bleeding , uterine prolapse intra-epithelial neoplasia cervix grade 3 . ( 1 ) Fever common perioperative complication hysterectomy , arise 25 % . ( 2 ) The early complication associate hysterectomy include hemorrhage , infection , injury adjacent organ , femoral neuropathy , thromboembolic disease . ( 3 ) However , whether hysterectomy link development urinary symptom remain controversial . Some group observe effect improve urinary dysfunction hysterectomy , ( 4-7 ) others report hysterectomy cause variety urinary symptom include urethral syndrome , stress incontinence , detrusor overactivity void difficulty . ( 8 , 9 ) Voiding difficulty female condition bladder fail empty completely easily micturition . Failure detect voiding difficulty surgery may lead bladder overdistention irreversible damage detrusor muscle . ( 10 ) Postoperative urinary retention ( PUR ) define inability void full bladder postoperative period . The etiology PUR involve combination many factor , include sedation , type anesthesia , increase sympathetic stimulation , overdistension bladder large quantity fluid give intravenously , pain anxiety . ( 11 ) In literature , incidence postoperative urinary retention ( PUR ) range 3.8 % 80 % , depend definition use type surgery perform . ( 12-15 ) There consensus diagnose PUR various criterion , clinical symptom , bladder palpation fix time interval drainage catheterization 500 ml urine , use . ( 16 ) Traditionally gynecologist use indwell catheter abdominal surgical procedure several reason , include beliefs woman would unable void satisfactorily immediate postoperative period , indwell catheter provide reliable method assure adequate exposure , catheter would necessary record intake-output . In fact , prompt woman 's dislike catheter well increase incidence postoperative urinary tract infection ( UTI ) . ( 17 ) The potential sequela UTI include gram-negative bacteremia , antimicrobial toxicity , chronic bacteriuria chronic renal disease . ( 18 ) In case infection mild easily treat , UTI common nosocomial infection lead increase morbidity treatment cost . ( 18-20 ) Some North American study address postoperative UTI confound use perioperative antibiotic , ( 17 , 21 ) suggest UTI rate 3-10 % , whereas British work suggest rate 35 % control patient receive antibiotic . ( 22 ) It estimate risk UTI associate indwell catheterization 5-10 % per day catheterization ( 18 ) commonest cause UTI hospital urinary catheterization ( 23 ) . Short-term catheterization associate subsequent bacterial colony count &gt; 105/ml urine 21 % woman undergo minor surgery , ( 24 ) incidence positive urine culture rise length time catheterization continue . ( 17 , 18 ) In randomize trial study effect prophylactic antibiotic postoperative UTI patient undergo abdominal hysterectomy , Ireland et al find single dose cotrimoxazole effective reduce incidence postoperative UTI 35 % control group 4 % treat group . ( 25 ) Hakvoort et al study whether prolonged urinary bladder catheterization vaginal prolapse surgery advantageous . ( 26 ) They find residual volume &gt; 200 ml need recatheterization occur 9 % 4 day catheterization group versus 40 % patient one day catheterization group ( OR 0.15 , 95 % CI 0.045-0.47 ) . Positive urine culture find 40 % case 4 day catheterization group versus 4 % patient one day catheterization group ( OR 15 , 95 % CI 3.2-68.6 ) . By contrast , prospective study postoperative infection abdominal vaginal gynecological surgery , Kingdom et al report 40 % 115 patient receive prophylactic antibiotic develop UTI postoperative period clearly related need postoperative catheterization . ( 25 ) Since prolong indwelling urinary catheterization may associate increase risk UTI , increase patient morbidity potentially prolonging hospital stay ( 18 ) , prophylactic antibiotic reduction catheter time catheter surgery might expect reduce risk . Regarding relationship bladder catheterization PUR , publish data prospective retrospective study PUR abdominal vaginal hysterectomy , find several factor postoperative care affect result PUR include type surgery , use catheter , duration catheterization , postoperative analgesia . ( 16 , 17 , 25 , 27-30 ) During 4-year period , Summitt et al use postoperative bladder catheter drainage routine vaginal hysterectomy . ( 28 ) To assess potential difference postoperative outcome , prospectively compare use indwell bladder catheter drainage catheter use standard vaginal hysterectomy . Their data show 2 patient catheterize group require recatheterization catheter remove ; none no-catheter group require catheter . The result infer indwell catheterization appear unnecessary routine vaginal hysterectomy . In prospective randomize trial study , Dobbs et al compare infection rate postoperative morbidity indwell catheterization in-out catheterization time abdominal hysterectomy . ( 27 ) Of 95 patient study , 36 % undergoing in-out catheterization PUR , require bladder emptying , compare 4 % receive indwelling catheter . In addition , 29 % catheterize group urinary tract bacteriuria compare 13 % uncatheterized group . They conclude in-out urinary catheterization time routine abdominal hysterectomy associate significantly high incidence PUR compare indwell catheterization , may implications long-term bladder function . ( 27 ) Dobbs et al also point abdominal muscular pain intra-abdominal pressure increase void couple decreased sensation void due analgesia , suggest indwell catheter immediate postoperative period help prevent long-term morbidity bladder atony . Bodker Lose present prevalence PUR 9.2 % patient receive gynecological surgery . ( 16 ) Of 124 patient undergoing abdominal hysterectomy , 13.7 % PUR . Of 24 patient undergoing laparoscopic assist vaginal hysterectomy ( LAVH ) , 8.7 % PUR . They conclude patient risk PUR difficult predict . The risk high laparotomy laparoscopy . A retention rate 13.7 % abdominal hysterectomy fairly similar 11.8 % gynecologic laparotomy report Schiotz , ( 29 ) Who use indwell Foley catheter routinely 20-24 hour ascertain risk UTI aymptomatic bacteriuria . Based 949 gynecologic laparotomy without use catheter bladder needle end surgery , Bartzen Halferty find 26 % need catheterization . ( 17 ) They suggest abstain use indwelling catheter also associate low cost great patient satisfaction . With advent minimally invasive surgery , LAVH currently advocate alternative abdominal hysterectomy . Reported benefit LAVH short-term study , compare abdominal hysterectomy , include short hospital stay convalescence , less postoperative pain , low morbidity , , series , great cost-effectiveness . ( 31-35 ) Whereas benefit LAVH long-term follow-up , study appear literature . A report Taiwan , Shen et al compare 1-month 8-year follow-up LAVH abdominal hysterectomy . In 8-year follow-up show statistically significant difference vaginal vault prolapse , cystocele , rectocele , enterocele , postcoital bleeding , cuff granulation LAVH abdominal hysterectomy procedure . ( 36 ) However , regard consequence PUR UTI LAVH , best knowledge , study conduct examine bladder catheterization associate problem . Furthermore , study perform evaluate long-term sequela PUR LAVH .</detailed_description>
