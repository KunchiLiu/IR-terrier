	<brief_title>The Accuracy Artificially-intelligent Stethoscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart murmur ausculted pediatric patient , underlie Congenital Structural Heart ( CSH ) Disease rare . Nevertheless , CSH Disease often first suggest presence murmur . Primary care provider refer pediatric patient Cardiologists murmur evaluation low accuracy , pattern result : 1. needless emotional strain many patient functionally normal heart family , 2. increase morbidity mortality rate rare patient delay cardiac diagnosis , 3. exorbitant cost society . Referral accuracy murmur evaluation probably low difference innocent pathological murmur subtle . Computer-assisted analysis heart sound may increase accuracy primary care referral pediatric cardiologist , accuracy FDA-approved artificially-intelligent cardiac auscultation system , Zargis Medical Corporation 's Cardioscan® , never determine prospectively unselected population live pediatric patient . As primary endpoint , study herein propose would prospectively compare sensitivity specificity Cardioscan® CHMCA 's Pediatric Cardiologists identification cardiac pathology among 300 new unselected pediatric patient refer CHMCA 's cardiologist murmur evaluation , use two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography common gold-standard . Double-blinding place . The study also attempt secondarily gauge clinical significance pathology miss Cardioscan® , define sub-populations patient among Cardioscan's® judgment consider less accurate , gather data concern value acceptability family Cardioscan® . If ( expect ) Cardioscan's® accuracy merely approach Pediatric Cardiologists , study herein propose would still establish Cardioscan® formidable tool primary care providers—a helpful , billable , potentially cost-saving alternative consulting Cardiology patient probably- possibly-innocent murmur . Data collection project occur predominantly within CHMCA 's Heart Center Akron , although data collection may occur within CHMCA and/or CHMCA 's Heart Centers Beachwood and/or Boardman . Minimal disruption exist clinical patient flow setting would expect entire protocol expect completely painless noninvasive , foreseeable health risk .</detailed_description>
