	<brief_summary>Src expression identify majority Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) cell line preclinical evidence Src family kinase may important hypoxic growth angiogenesis NSCLC . We hypothesize inhibition Src pathway dasatinib demonstrate anti-tumor activity early stage NSCLC , tolerable safety profile . Patients receive dasatinib , Src inhibitor , 3 week prior surgical resection early stage NSCLC . Fresh frozen tumor tissue need genomic analysis . If fresh frozen tumor tissue available initial diagnosis , biopsy require participate trial . A second tumor sample obtain time surgical resection evaluate change genomic expression profile . Patients eligible receive 3 month adjuvant dasatinib therapy completion standard adjuvant therapy recovery surgery standard adjuvant therapy give , evidence neoadjuvant tumor response ( radiologic and/or pathologic ) dasatinib . Many patient present NSCLC active smoker . Patients smoke time surgery experience increase peri-operative complication compare patient smoke cigarette immediately prior surgery . While trial limit active smoker , period smoking cessation prior surgery attractive window opportunity potentially active novel anticancer therapy dasatinib offer patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Evaluating The Safety And Response To Neoadjuvant Dasatinib In Early Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II study dasatinib , target biologic agent , know inhibit Src . It difficult assess outcome phase II adjuvant trial measurable disease evaluate efficacy many variable could confound compare survival subject trial historical control . Therefore , fresh frozen tumor tissue sample obtain genomic analysis , plan treat subject neoadjuvant dasatinib measure tumor response therapy prior surgery . Resected tumor also assess pathologic response well change genomic expression pattern . Subjects treat neoadjuvant dasatinib 70 mg PO twice daily 3 week , mandatory minimum 3 day ( 72 hour ) study drug prior surgical resection . Imaging study do pre-treatment pre-surgery ass radiologic response therapy . The surgical specimen evaluate pathologic response . A tumor tissue sample obtain surgical specimen genomic analysis evaluate change genomic expression profile . Patients whose tumor response neoadjuvant dasatinib therapy might benefit good cancer control receive potentially therapeutic course adjuvant dasatinib . Patients least 15 % decrease well objective response , without evidence progression neoadjuvant dasatinib ( per tumor evaluation pre-surgery ) pathologic response ( define ≥30 % tumor necrosis cell death ) neoadjuvant dasatinib therapy eligible receive dasatinib 70 mg twice daily 90 day completion standard adjuvant therapy recovery surgery standard adjuvant therapy give . Patients follow approximately 30 day last dose dasatinib ass toxicity . Response evaluate Src regulate Src deregulate cohort tumor . If response neoadjuvant dasatinib occur , accrual either cohort expand . If response neoadjuvant dasatinib cohort group , accrual either cohort stop . The result study may useful design future study early stage NSCLC use dasatinib alone combination chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
