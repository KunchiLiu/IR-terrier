	<brief_summary>Aging , birth trauma extensive pelvic surgery cause know cause advance pelvic organ prolaspe , fecal well urinary incontinence . Surgical treatment last resort manage above-mentioned clinical manifestation pelvic floor disorder except subject frail receive operation . In order improve outcome reconstructive pelvic surgery , reinforcement synthetic mesh biological material modern trend pelvic repair . Unfortunately prosthesis include synthetic biological ideal vaginal erosion mesh extrusion subject protocol complication report continuously . As per literature , rate mesh vaginal extrusion range 2.4 17 % polypropylene popular synthetic material use mid-urethral sling pelvic reconstructive surgery date . The cause complication still controversial include rejection , poor quality tissue , surgical artifact , material mesh etc . A prospective control study investigation cause mesh vaginal erosion conduct result reveal evidence immune reactivity mesh implantation , albeit evidence solid ( Am J Obstet Gynecol 2004 ; 191 ( 6 ) : 1868-1874 ) . As per pilot study initially do u determine biofilm-related-infection , find bacterial biofilm could adhere surface interface , i.e . bacteria locate cell beneath contact surface electron microscopic ( EM ) analysis . In addition , soon bacteria infection , proteins biofilm undergo conformational change , make immunogenic trigger typical inflammatory response lead activation complement system . Thus , plan use CD ( cluster differentiation ) antigens - 4 , 8 , 20 , 25 , 40 , 68 quantitative analysis FoxP3 determine function regulatory T cell immune response . In addition , bacterial culture EM analysis excise mesh surround vagina tissue perform analysis biofilms .</brief_summary>
