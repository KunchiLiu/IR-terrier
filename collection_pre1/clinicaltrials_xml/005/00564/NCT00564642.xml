	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis one major health problem develop country . Isoniazid , rifampin pyrazinamide , first line drug use tuberculosis chemotherapy , associate hepatotoxicity . The rate hepatotoxicity report much high develop country compare advanced country similar dose schedule . Oxidative stress propose one mechanism responsible anti-tuberculosis drug induce hepatic injury . The oxidative stress closely associate decrease glutathione level . In present study N acetylcysteine , precursor glutathione , investigated hepatoprotective effect anti-tuberculosis drug induce liver injury .</brief_summary>
