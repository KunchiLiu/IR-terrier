	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) -labeled positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan work plan chemotherapy treat patient stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , carboplatin , gemcitabine hydrochloride , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Diagnostic imaging procedure , FDG-labeled PET scan , may help guide chemotherapy allow doctor plan good treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FDG-Labeled PET Scan Planning Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Stage IIIB IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess response rate patient demonstrate early response carboplatin/paclitaxel determine FDG-PET ( `` initial non-responders '' ) subsequently treat three additional course docetaxel/gemcitabine . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate ability FDG-PET predict response therapy measure compute tomography ( CT ) . II . Evaluate early late change tumor FDG uptake ( change standardize uptake value [ SUV ] ) patient correlate overall survival ( OS ) . OUTLINE : All patient receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Patients undergo FDG-PET/CT scan day 18-21 . Patients assign 1 2 treatment group . GROUP I ( Responders ) : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 3 additional course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GROUP II ( Initial non-responders ) : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 docetaxel IV 1 hour day 8 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo FDG-PET/CT scan day 18-21 course 2 . After completion study treatment , patient follow day 81-84 periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
