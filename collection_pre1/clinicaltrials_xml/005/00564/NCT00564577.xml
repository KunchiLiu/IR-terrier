	<brief_summary>This strain dose-finding study LSN03-016011/A ETEC administer start inoculum 5x108 cfu 5 subject establish human disease model . If 80 % attack rate ( AR ) achieve without high output diarrhea , inoculum give 10 subject confirmation AR . If 80 % AR achieve , attack rate severity disease evaluate determine dose increase . The sequence may conduct WS6788A applicable . If LSN strain cause high output diarrhea dose adjust dose characterization continue . An iterative process use select optimal strain dose step review approve medical monitor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Finding Study WS6788A LSN03-016011/A Enterotoxigenic E. Coli ETEC Challenge Strains That Express CS17</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1 , open-label , strain dose-finding study design establish human challenge model CS17+ ETEC cause &gt; 80 % attack rate without cause high output diarrhea . Based strain history , test commence use LSN03-016011/A . This strain isolate naïve adult U.S. citizen live Turkey typical clinical presentation ETEC diarrheal disease bacterial co-pathogens isolated stool . The host representative study population study future efficacy study anti-CS17+ ETEC vaccine . As show figure , 5x108 cfu ETEC strain ( LSN03-016011/A ) initially administer 5 subject . If attack rate &gt; 80 % ( least 4/5 subject ) occur high output diarrhea , result confirm additional 10 subject . Additionally , inoculum least ½ log low ( 1x108 ) ( depend severity illness document ) may administer 10 subject characterize dose-response relationship . If 5x108 cfu inoculum cause high output diarrhea , inoculum reduce appropriatelyIf 5x108 cfu LSN03-016011/A cause &gt; 80 % attack rate , next step depend observe attack rate severity illness . A low attack rate mild disease would prompt change alternate strain ( WS7688A ) testing , use pathway use LSN strain . An attack rate &lt; 80 % diarrhea classify least moderate diarrhea would prompt upward adjustment LSN inoculum appropriate finding . The decision move inoculum change CS17 + strain occur concurrence medical monitor . Following step strain dose find iteration , report summarize result step , detail plan next step sign principal investigator medical monitor . The maximum dose either strain 1 X 109 . The anticipated maximum number subject plan study 25 . Subjects admit inpatient facility study day -1 . On study day 0 , subject morning meal , fast 90 minute , give 120mL sodium bicarbonate buffer neutralize stomach acidity . Approximately one minute later ingest appropriate dose strain ( either LSN03-016011/A WS6788A ) CS17+ ETEC dilute 30mL sodium bicarbonate buffer . Doses challenge inoculum prepare one study staff microbiologist . Treatment antibiotic start study day 5 , early criterion early antibiotic treatment fulfil . Subjects discharge feel well 2 consecutive stool culture negative CS17+ ETEC . For group 5 study subject , study period include screening period , one month inpatient outpatient phase , six-months final phone check . The study period , account serial schedule multiple group 5 , process immunology specimen , study analysis report writing , 1 ½ year .</detailed_description>
