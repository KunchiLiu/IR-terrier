	<brief_summary>Purpose : To assess whether EMG direct biofeedback therapy Botulinum toxin type A injection levator ani muscle effect pain levator ani syndrome , , addition , extent either treatment superior term anorectal physiologic measurement , quality life . Study Design : Randomized , prospective , unblinded double-armed study crossover . Methodology : Female subject , age 18 , painful levator ani muscle spasm least one month duration randomize receive either biofeedback therapy Botulinum toxin type A injection . After randomization undergo visual analog pain scoring , anorectal manometry , colonoscopy ( clinically indicate ) , self-reported SF-36 quality life measurement . Each patient also complete numerical pain scale scoring , SF-36 , satisfaction questionnaire treatment visit follow-up visit . Patients submit mail . Identification number assign subject use SF-36 Satisfaction Questionnaires throughout study . Subjects undergo anorectal manometry end treatment arm . In biofeedback arm patient treat biweekly eight treatment provide exercise practice home base muscle function note biofeedback train session . Subjects keep treatment diary exercise home help ensure compliance protocol . In Botulinum toxin injection arm patient treat scheduled injection levator ani muscle every six week three total injection 100U . These injection direct painful area levator muscle guide physical exam EMG measurement . Should patient fail initial randomize treatment assignment ( failure define `` dissatisfied '' `` dissatisfy '' satisfaction questionnaire ) , allow cross study arm . In addition numerical pain scale scoring , SF-36 questionnaire anorectal manometry also repeat time crossover . We intend include randomized patient final data analysis ( accord originally assign treatment arm ) , regardless outcome reason dropout , thus make `` intent-to-treat '' analysis . Pivotal Study Definitions : The definition adequate pain reduction , purpose data analysis , reduction subject 's mean pain score two numerical pain scale ( 0-10 ) . Failure either therapy define response `` dissatisfied '' `` dissatisfy '' satisfaction questionnaire end either biofeedback ( eight treatment visit ) Botulinum toxin ( three injection ) crossover . Outcomes : We determine follow biofeedback therapy Botulinum toxin type A injection : mean pain reduction , difference anorectal physiologic measurement ( mean rest anal sphincter pressure ) , change self-reported quality life , overall patient satisfaction .</brief_summary>
