	<brief_summary>Nasal Potential Difference measurement ( NPD ) perform Israel since 1996 . NPD measurement use assess voltage across nasal epithelium , correlate transport sodium chloride across cell membrane . NPD first demonstrate abnormal Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) 1981 technique since use increase understand condition . It establish important diagnostic tool recently use ass effectiveness new treatment gene alternative therapy ( Knowles 1995 ; Wilschanski 2003 ) . The nasal cavity accessible make good site examine ion transport characteristic airway epithelia . Less centimetre nose squamous ( `` skin type '' ) epithelium become ciliated pseudocolumnar epithelium , characteristic proximal airway . The change NPD perfusion different solution demonstrate . By employ NPD protocol perfusion different solution drug , different aspect nasal ion transport characteristic examine . In CF , ion transport profile abnormal NPD measurement number feature differentiate CF non-CF . This methodology well establish measurement subject 6 year age . Measurements small child infant difficult perform . We propose new method use small , single lumen catheter much low perfusion rate ( 0.2 ml/min compare 5 ml/min adult method ) .Perfusion measurement possible newly bear infant . Obviously open potential use NPD diagnostic test baby . This important diagnosis CF often difficult make refute baby problem collect enough sweat . This may ideal diagnostic test CF neonatal nursery infant meconium plug syndrome .</brief_summary>
