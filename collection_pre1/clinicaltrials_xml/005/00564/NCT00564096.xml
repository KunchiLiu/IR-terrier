	<detailed_description>Research deep TMS treatment patient schizophrenia experience auditory hallucination , double blind placebo ( sham ) control study October 14 , 2007 Physical background Modern TMS begin 1985 Barker colleague Sheffield , UK , develop first TMS device . However , original commercially available stimulators limit frequency could produce stimuli recharge circuit therefore allow application single-pulse TMS . To date , device capable stimulate brain frequency 100 Hz open new possibility magnetic stimulation . TMS base Faraday 's principle electromagnetic induction . A rapidly change magnetic field ( 2 T ) generate pass brief ( 0.2-0.9 millisecond ( m ) ) high-current alternate electric pulse insulate coil make wire . When coil place scalp magnetic field pass readily skull induces weak electrical current superficial cortex brain last exactly long current pulse coil . The induced electrical activity cause cortical neuron discharge action potentials.Until recently stimulation nervous tissue deeply approximately 2 cm scalp possible . Neurobiological background TMS prove modulate variety brain substance include increase expression neuropeptide cholecystokinin ( CCK ) mRNA rat , increase fire rate dopaminergic neuron ventral tegmental area substantia nigra , elevation taurine serine aspartate hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus , release monoamine hippocampus , ( believe highly involved pathophysiology depression ) , increase hippocampal serotonin 5-HIAA content acute rTMS , selective increase 5-HT1A binding site frontal cortex , cingulated cortex , anterior olfactory nucleus response single train rTMS , well regulation cortical b-adrenergic receptor . General clinical background TMS hold potential able selectively modulate activity brain area involve pathological process depression , mania , obsessive-compulsive disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder schizophrenia . The large single area TMS research psychiatry exploration possible therapeutic effect cortical , usually prefrontal , stimulation symptom major depression . Clinical , neurophysiological imaging background auditory hallucination Auditory hallucination report 50 % 70 % patient schizophrenia generally consist spoken speech `` voice . '' Evidences include review 16 study find average prevalence 60 % auditory hallucination patient diagnosis schizophrenia . Patients usually describe hallucinatory experience distressing , consistent evidence common hallucinate utterance abusive term , contribute 25 % case serious suicide attempt . The neuroanatomical basis auditory hallucination think involve increase blood flow speech perception area brain , superior temporal cortex dominant hemisphere well right leave superior temporal cortex . Brain imaging study patient auditory hallucination reveal active area right leave superior temporal cortex , Broca 's area , leave temporoparietal cortex . Shergill et al . report presence active area anterior cingulate cortex , right thalamus , leave hippocampus , parahippocampal cortex subject experience auditory hallucination . Magnetic Stimulation Left Temporoparietal Cortex suggest mechanism auditory hallucination involve activation leave temporoparietal cortex . SPET auditory hallucination patient schizophrenia demonstrate blood flow leave inferior frontal region ( Broca 's area ) hallucination , thus implicate language-production area experience auditory hallucinations.Other Positron emission tomography study demonstrate activation subcortical nucleus ( thalamic , striatal ) , limbic structure ( especially hippocampus ) , paralimbic region ( parahippocampal cingulate gyrus , well orbitofrontal cortex ) . TMS base double blind study show auditory hallucination , preferentially affected area appear locate primary auditory cortex , rather secondary association area posterior planum temporale . Positron emission tomography [ 18F ] -fluorodeoxyglucose 12 DSM-III schizophrenic patient experience auditory hallucination glucose uptake compare patient experience hallucination show patient experience hallucination significantly lower relative metabolism auditory Wernicke 's region trend toward high metabolism right hemisphere homologue Broca 's region . Some researcher suggest hallucinated voice might actually inner speech misperceive stimulation outside . Safety Generally , TMS treatment report well tolerate . No serious adverse effect report patient . There evidence rTMS cause structural brain damage detrimental cellular alteration . There however , low risk inducing seizure rTMS risk increase high stimulation frequency intensity . Headache main side effect report , however , incidence headache approximately 250 treatment session , find high 8 % . Regarding auditory hallucination , Safety TMS give Left Temporoparietal Cortex generally well tolerated exception transient Concentration memory difficulty last 5 10 minute follow rTMS , also frequently sham arm study.With regard slow transcranial magnetic stimulation aim resistant auditory hallucination significant adverse event disclose . In double blind study leave right temporoparietal cortex stimulate repeatedly two week , subject report headache ( N = 5 ) , dizziness ( N = 2 ) , amnesia ( N = 1 ) , subject sham arm study report headache ( N = 2 ) , dizziness ( N = 1 ) , difficulty concentrating ( N = 1 ) . These adverse effect disappear within 10 min completion rTMS treatment see leave right hemisphere treatment . In accordance clinical study , rodent study available far support notion rTMS safe technique even use chronically , i.e . 11 week rat . The use rTMS human regard safe . Regarding deep TMS , study 35 healthy volunteer conduct collaboration Shalvata Mental Health Care Center , Sheba Medical Center Neurobiology Department Weitzman Institute Science , demonstrate safety deep TMS treatment . The study enclose . In study Deep TMS administer trained doctor , patient wear ear-plugs avoid hearing damage . Rationale The rational study base follow : Resistance treatment , significant subjective suffering &amp; risk suicide 1 . As mention earlier auditory hallucination report 50 % -70 % patient schizophrenia , , indeed , successfully treat antipsychotic medication , 25 % -30 % refractory antipsychotic drug . 2 . Auditory hallucination cause great distress , functional disability , lack behavioral control . 3 . A variety psychosocial treatment use , efficacy describe mainly individual case report relative merit unclear . 4 . Falloon Talbot ( 1981 ) report quarter schizophrenic patient make serious suicide attempt response auditory hallucination . Promising response auditory hallucination TMS - A double blind study Thirty-nine patient schizophrenia treatment-refractory auditory hallucination show daily repetitive TMS 1 Hz 20 min per day 10 treatment day leave right temporoparietal achieve significant change frequency auditory hallucination , positive symptom PANSS , CGI-I . - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Left Temporoparietal Cortex frequency 1 Hz 9 day 24 patient schizophrenia /schizoaffective disorder medication-resistant auditory hallucination achieve substantial improvement hallucination frequency attentional salience 52 % patient maintain improvement least 15 week . - A study 24 patient schizophrenia give low frequency ( 1 Hz ) repetitive transcranial magnetic Stimulation leave temporoparietal cortex 5 consecutive work day achieve improvement Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale score well source monitoring ( = increase ability identify self-generate item come ) . - A double-blind crossover study ten schizophrenia patient resistant auditory hallucination give 5 day low frequency rTMS ( 1 Hz ) leave temporoparietal cortex demonstrate diminution 56 % hallucination reflect reduction seven item auditory hallucination rating scale well diminution SAPS score . Reasons believe right frontotemporal TMS stimulation cortex ameliorate auditory hallucination include evidence right temporoparietal stimulation achieve significant change frequency auditory hallucination , patient auditory hallucination increase blood flow note right superior temporal gyrus , right temporal lobe activation auditory hallucination , effect rTMS spread opposite hemisphere interhemispheric connection , evidence brain circuit involve production auditory hallucination symptoms schizophrenia widespread confine leave temporoparietal cortex . Advantages deep TMS non-deep TMS Deep TMS reach brain structure deep 5 cm whereas non-deep TMS reach structure less half distance . As deep brain structure thalamic , limbic paralimbic region show activated auditory hallucination suspect play role pathogenesis auditory hallucination , stimulation may attenuate auditory hallucination . Non-deep TMS stimulate cortex neuronal pathway connect deeper brain structure stimulation may additive . According Cleghorn et al striatum play critical role auditory hallucination . Methods Each site intend recruit 20 patient age 18-60 year old , diagnose suffer schizophrenia experience auditory hallucination daily basis . The operator well rater blind kind treatment give specific patient treat/evaluate clinically . Patients randomly equally divide 2 study group : Group 1 : 10 patient give 20 minute stimulation real deep H1-Coil TMS Left Temporo-parietal Cortex frequency 1 Hz 120 % motor threshold 20 consecutive working day . Group 2 : 10 patient give 20 minute stimulation sham deep H1-Coil TMS Left Temporo-parietal Cortex frequency 1 Hz 120 % motor threshold 10 consecutive working day , thereafter 20 session real TMS parameter ( =Left Tempor-oparietal Cortex frequency 1 Hz 120 % motor threshold ) . Schedule Patient evaluation Patients evaluate follow manner : Group 1 : Within 72 hour first TMS study session , 24 hour 10th session , right 11th session 24 hour 20th session , one week last session one month last session . Group 2 : Within 72 hour first TMS study session , 24 hour 10th session , right 11th session 24 hour 20th session right 21th session , 24 hour 30th session , one week last session one month last session . Patients ' evaluation include follow measure : 1 . Auditory hallucination Rating Scale develop Hoffman colleague ( 2003 ) . 2 . Scale Assessment Positive Symptoms score ( SAPS ; Andreasen Olsen 1982 ) . 3 . Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ) . 4 . Assessment Negative Symptoms ( SANS ) . 5 . Quality Life Enjoyment Satisfaction Questionnaire ( Q-LES-Q ) . 6 . Quick Inventory Depressive Symptomatology ( QIDS-SR16 ) 7 . Personal Social Functioning ( GAF ) 8 . The magnitude auditory hallucination evaluate every patient close care taker accord care taker impression patient 's behavior ( For example talk ) , act patient explains obedience `` voice ' '' command attempt lessen voice ( For example leave home due fear voice escalation ) , unresponsive care taker question order due distraction hallucination . The care taker evaluation take place one week prior first TMS session , continue daily basis one week last TMS session . This evaluation hence call `` Care taker auditory hallucination evaluation '' CTAHE . The care taker evaluate patient 's hallucinatory behavior scale 0 10 , `` 0 '' completely hallucination free `` 10 '' behavior dictate hallucination alone.This could do use visual analogue scale . Average rating later compare pre &amp; post treatment period . As care taker blind TMS give patient ( sham real ) A care taker `` Placebo '' impression thus overcome .
