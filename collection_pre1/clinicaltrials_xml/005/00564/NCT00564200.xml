	<detailed_description>Multiple Myeloma plasma cell disorder characterize uncontrolled proliferation bone marrow plasma cell lead skeletal destruction bone pain , anemia , renal failure , hypercalcemia , recurrent bacterial infection extramedullary plasmacytoma . It account 1 % malignancy slightly 10 % hematologic malignancy , annual incidence four per 100.000 . Although disease incurable median survival 3 year , remarkable treatment advance recently make , include high-dose therapy follow stem cell rescue , particularly , introduction novel promise agent new mechanisms action . The treatment alquilant agent , melphalan cyclophosphamide combine prednisone median 3 year survival rate approximately 50 % . The chemotherapy combination high-dose dexamethasone increase response rate minimal effect survival benefit . The limited efficacy conventional treatment produce introduction high-dose therapy follow stem cell transplant order increase antitumoral effect prolong disease-free overall survival . This way , autologous stem cell transplant turn optimal treatment patient young 65 year myeloma . Nevertheless increase evidence benefit patient show complete disease remission transplantation . The transcendental factor determines CR post-transplantation achievement initial chemotherapy- sensitivity disease , measure rapidity grade response ( rapidity maximum response assessment ) pre-transplantation M protein level ( i.e. , grade response initial treatment ) . On hand , treatment alquilant agent impede obtention adequate number stem cell make impossible autotransplantation practice . For reason nowadays treatment base dexamethasone use initial chemotherapy . However , regimens particularly AVD le activity alquilant agent treatment . Bortezomib show fast antimyeloma activity ( response 1 2 cycle ) refractory patient , myelosuppression cellular injury observe . Alternating bortezomib dexamethasone pre-transplant induction regimen would show following advantage : 1. rapid high effect raise mean use two drug proven activity administer separately , 2. absence stem cell injury , 3. different toxicity type avoid habitual side effect dexamethasone abuse , one administer every cycle happen AVD type regimen .</detailed_description>
