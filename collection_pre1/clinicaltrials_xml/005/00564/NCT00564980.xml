	<brief_title>PRCT : Comparing Two Procedures Ulno-Carpal Abutment Syndrome .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulnocarpal abutment syndrome ( UAS ) ( also know ulnar impaction syndrome , ulnocarpal impingement , ulnar carpal loading ) common cause ulnar side wrist pain . UAS result increase load ulnocarpal articulation usually associate positive ulnar variance . The increased loading joint lead degeneration perforation Triangular fibrocartilage ( TFC ) . Chondromalacic change develop oppose surface lunate triquetrum distally ulnar head proximally . A disruption lunotriquetral ligament may follow ensue LT arthritis . Treatment UAS involve decompression pressure impingement , abutment ulnocarpal articulation . Debridement triangular fibrocartilage complex ( TFCC ) tear alone patient UAS may failure rate much 25 % 30 % . Good result report combined arthroscopic TFCC debridement distal ulnar resection . 69 % excellent 32 % good result report open limited distal ulnar resection patient TFCC tear positive ulnar variance . Similar result report ulnar shorten osteotomy open wafer distal ulnar resection UAS patient . Because treatment choice appear yield similar relief symptom , determination optimal treatment protocol remain point debate . The literature contain retrospective data compare open wafer procedure ulnar shorten osteotomy treatment UAS . Likewise , literature compare arthroscopic wafer ulnar shorten osteotomy retrospective . However , , date , randomize prospective clinical trial compare type surgery . Both type surgery widely accept optimal treatment remain debate . It unclear technique compare term efficacy elimination symptom UAS also term relative complication rate .</detailed_description>
