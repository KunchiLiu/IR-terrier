	<brief_summary>The propose project case control study design . Subject 's suffer stroke willing participate study shortly interview assess eligibility accord inclusion-exclusion criterion . Subjects suffer chronic hemiplegia upon question judge meet follow inclusion criterion : ( ) able stand independently 90 second ; ( b ) able walk 10 meter ( cane necessary ) ; ( c ) able understand verbal instruction . The exclusion criterion : ( ) Serious visual impairment ; ( b ) Inability ambulate independently ( cane acceptable , walker ) . ( c ) Severely impaired cognitive status ( score less 24 Mini Mental State Examination ) . ( ) Persons impaired communication capability . The whole project conduct period 3 month . A total 36 subject assign water base exercise program . The exercise group meet 24 occasion period 12 week ( 2 times/week ) . The subject exercise group recruit Sha'ar Ha'negev Swimming pool patient get Physical Therapy treatment Kupat Holim Clalit . Gait balance function test group well establish measure technique train period . The measure technique 1 ) Medical background variable . 2 ) Berg Balance Scale . 3 ) Late life Function Disability Instrument . 4 ) Get go test - stand walk 3 meter turn around walk back chair . 5 ) step execution test single dual task ; 5 ) stability test . 6 ) also fall monitor year completion study . The water training intervention perform different level level reflect different increase demand postural control system . For example , instructor increase difficulty certain water-exercise instructing participant use less external support , close eye , decrease support area ( stand one leg narrow stance , unstable surface ) . These `` tool '' allow instructor implement step exercise group level still challenge individual even skill level group varies . The water exercise also include perturbation exercise trigger specific reflex-like balance response . On level instructor instantly modify exercise less challenging participant .</brief_summary>
