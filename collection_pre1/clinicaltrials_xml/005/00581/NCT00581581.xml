	<detailed_description>Previous study demonstrate hypothermia hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy neonatal period generally safe feasible , improve intermediate term survival without handicap . There , however , information whether cool improves long term ( school-age ) outcomes non-handicapped survivor . The current observational trial design help obtain additional followup information child participate initial randomized clinical trial head-cooling neonatal encephalopathy . A first step collect information current status ( 7-8 year age ) participants original study use standardize telephone questionnaire . This allow investigator appropriately target child , detail , in-person neurodevelopmental test would appropriate .
