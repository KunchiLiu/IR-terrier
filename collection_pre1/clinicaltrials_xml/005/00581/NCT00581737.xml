	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate several aspect think ability include attention memory , quality life patient diagnose treated Primary CNS Lymphoma ( PCNSL ) , remission disease . The finding study may help u understand whether disease treatment may affect patient ' thinking skill , may provide important information use develop program improve quality life patient PCNSL . This research also study whether person particular type gene involve metabolism methionine ( 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine S-methyltransferase-MTR , MTFH reductase-MTFHR , transcobalamin 2-Tc2 ) , apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) likely delay adverse effect treatment tumor . The finding study may help u understand whether disease treatment may affect patient ' thinking skill , whether may relate certain gene .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The incidence primary central nervous system lymphoma ( PCNSL ) increase threefold immunocompetent population recent year . Improvements treatment , particularly involve combine modality therapy chemotherapy radiotherapy show augment patient survival median disease-free period 40 month . However , combination two modality often increase risk delay neurotoxicity . There paucity study assess neuropsychological functioning quality life patient PCNSL . The majority study report performance status survival rate , systematic cognitive evaluation seldom include . Unfortunately , rely variable adequately assess subtle cognitive impairment patient brain tumor experience . Neuropsychological difficulty often interfere disease free patient ' ability function premorbid level work home . A study include neuropsychological evaluation relatively large group patient PCNSL receive combined modality treatment , remission disease plan . A follow-up assessment also perform order monitor performance specify period time . The propose study also test hypothesis : ( 1 ) presence polymorphisms influence methionine metabolism place PCNSL patient treat chemotherapy alone combination radiotherapy risk develop treatment-induced white matter disease cognitive dysfunction ; ( 2 ) possession apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) Ñ”-4 allele associate development cognitive difficulty follow treatment PCNSL . Research order well understand incidence , extent , severity treatment-induced neuropsychological impairment patient PCNSL utmost importance , give recent increase number case diagnose longterm survival . It likely provide valuable information regard specific cognitive domain address development strategy cognitive rehabilitation intervention may appropriate . The finding study also relevant comparison ongoing future research investigate potential neurocognitive sequela alternative treatment modality PCNSL ( e.g. , high-dose chemotherapy follow peripheral blood progenitor cell ( PBPC ) transplant ) .</detailed_description>
