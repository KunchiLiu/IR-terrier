	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer second lead cause cancer relate death among men United States.1 Although still controversial , grow evidence early detection reduce prostate cancer mortality . Currently useful biomarker aid early detection measurement serum prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level . Despite value PSA substantial limitation . To overcome limitation total PSA testing , emerge evidence demonstrate relevant cancer biomarker detect urine . Patients present urology clinic radical prostatectomy ask enter study .
