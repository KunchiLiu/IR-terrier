	<brief_summary>Automobile drive crucial aspect everyday life , yet vehicular crash represent serious public health problem . Patients epilepsy elevate risk automobile crash , cause great personal suffering financial cost society . Most collision involve epileptic driver seizure relate may instead result cognitive effect upon drive performance epilepsy antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) . Several million American driver take AEDs treatment medical condition besides epilepsy may also risk cognitive impairment reduce drive performance . Empirical evidence effect AEDs drive performance would enable development drive guideline could lower risk injurious motor vehicle collision ; however , evidence currently lack . The broad goal project determine specific effect commonly utilized AED , phenytoin , assess drive performance cognitive ability neurologically normal volunteer take phenytoin randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study . Our proposed experiment ass : ( 1 ) cognitive function use standardized neuropsychological test ( attention , perception , memory , executive function ) , ( 2 ) drive performance phenytoin placebo administration , ( 3 ) effect phenytoin-related cognitive performance upon drive performance . To measure drive performance , use state-of-the-art fixed-base interactive driving simulator allow u observe driver error environment challenge yet safe driver tester , condition optimal stimulus response control . The result study 30 driver treat phenytoin placebo increase understanding role AED-related cognitive impairment drive safety error . A good understanding impact AEDs upon drive performance necessary rationally develop intervention could help prevent crash driver treat AEDs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients epilepsy elevate risk automobile crash , cause great personal suffering financial cost society . Most collision involve epileptic driver seizure relate may instead result cognitive effect upon drive performance epilepsy antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) . Several million American driver take AEDs treatment medical condition besides epilepsy may also risk cognitive impairment reduce drive performance . Empirical evidence effect AEDs drive performance would enable development drive guideline could lower risk injurious motor vehicle collision ; however , evidence currently lack . The broad goal current project determine specific effect AEDs cognitive function drive performance . To address goal assess drive performance cognitive ability neurologically normal volunteer take phenytoin ( Dilantin ) , commonly prescribe AED . Effects phenytoin drive performance cognition address randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study . Driver cognition assess use battery neuropsychological test . Driving performance objectively assess participant standardized task enact state-of-the-art driving simulator . Our 3 Specific Aims : Aim 1 : To assess effect phenytoin cognitive ability crucial drive task , include perception , attention , memory , executive function . Hypothesis 1 : A driver 's cognitive ability decline steady-state phenytoin administration compare placebo . Drivers higher blood level phenytoin show great decline . Aim 2 : To assess effect phenytoin drive performance safety error state-of-the-art drive simulator . Hypothesis 2 : Driving performance decline driver safety error increase phenytoin administration compare placebo . Drivers higher blood level phenytoin show great impairment drive . Aim 3 : To assess effect phenytoin-related cognitive impairment upon drive performance state-of-the-art driving simulator . Hypothesis 3 . Impairments cognitive function affect perception , attention , memory , executive function , arousal increase likelihood driver error may lead crash . Our hypothesis would support driver take phenytoin , oppose placebo , demonstrate worse cognitive performance neuropsychological test , safety error crash simulator . The hypothesis would also support driver higher phenytoin level show great impairment cognition driving . Once effect phenytoin drive performance demonstrate project , evidence support comprehensive research address specific dose serum level acute versus chronic administration . There currently evidence concern effect phenytoin drive performance . Accurate drive performance data patient receive phenytoin would allow determination fair accurate criterion make recommendation drive drive affect million patient take AEDS epilepsy condition . These data could also help reduce risk car crash due medication side effect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Anticipating 1015 % dropout rate , induct 30 neurologically normal subject ( age 18 ( 21 ) 60 ) obtain 25 evaluable subject legally license drive state residence actively drive appropriate legal guideline least 5 year ( minimize performance variation novice driver ) . Because study intend determine potential effect phenytoin drive performance , relatively healthy cohort patient must choose . Chronic medical psychiatric condition could cause significant alteration drive performance independent cause phenytoin , would complicate interpretation performance impairment . Subjects young 18 old 60 Have history prior seizure , family history epilepsy , prior history head injury Have know history prior drug alcohol abuse unwillingness abstain drug alcohol use study period Have past current active neurological psychiatric disorder could impair cognitive driving performance ( i.e . baseline IQ &lt; 90 , dementia , mental retardation , stroke , severe head injury , schizophrenia , active clinical depression , progressive brain tumor ) . Subjects chronic medical condition ( i.e . diabetes mellitus , renal insufficiency , congestive heart failure , hepatic dysfunction , hematologic condition , HIV ) Taking medication know affect central nervous system ( i.e . baseline prestudy treatment antiepileptic drug , anxiolytic , sedative , hypnotic , antidepressant , antipsychotic , narcotic tranquilizer ) Regularly use overthecounter cough suppressant , antihistamine , sleep aid ; ingest 7 cup daily coffee currently smoke cigarette . Subjects exclude complete SIREN test neuropsychological instrument visual hearing impairment ( history screen discovery correct visual acuity le 20/50 ) physical disability , history severe motion sickness adultâ€”a marker patient develop simulator sickness therefore participate SIREN testing .</criteria>
