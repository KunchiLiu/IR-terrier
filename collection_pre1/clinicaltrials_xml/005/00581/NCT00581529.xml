	<brief_title>Partial Breast Irradiation Using Accelerated Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-randomized Phase I-II feasibility study partial breast irradiation accelerate IMRT technique . In study , patient eligible estimate risk breast cancer elsewhere breast ( beyond tumor bed ) low . The radiation treatment available woman older 40 year , DCIS ( Ductal carcinoma situ ) T1 , N0 , M0 , ( AJCC classification , version 6.0 ) , non-lobular infiltrating carcinoma treat breast-conserving surgery . Patients undergo pre-treatment planning free breathe CT 5mm cut treatment position , breast board , arm extend head use plan traditional two field ( tangent ) plan . An Active Breathing Control ( ABC ) device use minimize target motion due breathe second CT scan . The lumpectomy cavity identify delineate , margin approximately 1.5 cm three dimension use allow subclinical tumor extension daily set-up error . The organ risk ( heart , lung , contralateral breast ) contour CT scan . An inverse planning system optimization tool employ order achieve best IMRT plan ( minimize dose heart , lungs contralateral breast ) , compare two field plan . If IMRT plan show optimal one , term dos organ risk , patient enrol protocol proceed treatment . Treatment start approximately two week plan CT obtain . All patient protocol treat accelerated radiotherapy , 3.85 Gy per fraction , bid , 5 consecutive day total dose 38.5 Gy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient unifocal histologically proven breast cancer , without calcification mammogram . DCIS ( Ductal carcinoma situ ) ( Tis , Stage 0 ) Nonlobular infiltrate carcinoma , maximum 2 cm diameter . ( T1 , Stage I ) The patient operate tumor excise lumpectomy The tumor report negative margin &gt; 3 mm , per hospital protocol . For invasive carcinoma , axillary lymph node negative sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) map biopsy formal axillary lymph node dissection . The patient 40 year old life expectancy least 5 year Karnofsky status must least 70 . See appendix I. Pre postmenopausal woman eligible entry . The patient must aware neoplastic nature disease must willing consent inform potential benefit , side effect risk radiotherapy . Institutional Review Board approval protocol consent form require . No concurrent neoadjuvant chemotherapy allow . Patient permit treated chemotherapy hormone therapy completion radiation treatment . Patients diffuse calcification , multifocal multicentric disease , lymphvascular invasion exclude . Patients participate extensive LCIS ( Lobular carcinoma situ ) specimen extensive DCIS . Patients exclude systemic disease present patient irradiate ipsilateral breast chest wall . Patients carrier BRCA 1/2 mutation high risk hereditary breast cancer due strong family history ( one premenopausal family member breast cancer ovarian cancer ) exclude increase potential inbreast recurrence elsewhere breast absence whole breast radiotherapy . Patients scleroderma , systemic discoid lupus exclude due potential significant radiotherapy associate toxicity . Pregnant woman participate study . Patients serious medical problem would limit survival &lt; 5 year psychiatric condition would prevent informed consent participate . Patients unable lie back raise arm head treatment plan position radiotherapy exclude . Patients mammographically occult disease exclude .</criteria>
