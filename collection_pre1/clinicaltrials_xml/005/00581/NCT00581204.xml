	<brief_summary>The purpose study measure physiology human undergo Lower Body Negative Pressure usea non-invasive low-power optical technique , near-infrared diffuse optical spectroscopy measurement compare measurement standard monitoring procedure delineate Brooke Army Medical Center . The Brooke Army Medical Center use near-infrared diffuse optical spectroscopy provide functional physiologic tissue organ information without ionize radiation without withdraw blood , cost-effective rapid manner . Monitoring onset circulatory shock wound soldier battlefield typically perform measurement arterial blood pressure , arterial oxygen saturation , simple auscultation pulse . Shock typically recognize non-specific sign subjective symptom cold clammy skin , pallor , weak thready pulse , unstable vital sign , diminish mentation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The near-infrared diffuse optical spectroscopy measure tissue region deeper skin surface report large tissue volume muscle brain . The near-infrared diffuse optical spectroscopy instrument generate harmless amount low-level non-ionizing near-infrared ligh measure tissue absorption scatter property depths 1 cm skin surface include large tissue volume muscle brain . The absorption property tissue provide determine absolute concentration deoxygenate hemoglobin , oxygenate hemoglobin , water , well total hemoglobin saturation .</detailed_description>
