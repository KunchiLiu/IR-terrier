	<brief_summary>The purpose study obtain chemical information part body without biopsy . This do use technique call magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) similar magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) except signal detect chemical ( spectroscopy ) naturally present body use radio wave . To receive information body , small loop wire ( surface coil ) , place near tissue interest , may use effectively detect signal come chemical body . The investigator may use second radio channel simultaneously , allow u obtain great chemical information ( decouple ) . The result may also help u understand study use help patient condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator propose use 1H spectroscopy 1H decouple 31P NMR spectroscopy obtain biochemical information tumor metabolism patient , antineoplastic therapy . In healthy volunteer , normal tissue metabolism also study . It hypothesize metabolic information may prognostic significance , may useful timing therapy .</detailed_description>
