	<brief_summary>The oxidative stress inflammatory state know contribute pathogenesis atherosclerosis , predictive cardiovascular event mortality rate general population patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , particularly patient end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) dialysis therapy 1 . Increased oxidative stress inflammation identify stage CKD , range moderate renal insufficiency ESRD . However , pathophysiology increase oxidative stress inflammation associate development CKD currently poorly understood . There also concern epidemic obesity United States , overall health status general population adversely affect increase adiposity . Recent study indicate strong relationship adiposity incident CKD . Furthermore , presence elevate body mass index ( BMI ) independent predictor progression ESRD , even additional adjustment baseline blood pressure presence absence diabetes mellitus . Limited data general population show healthy lifestyle intervention , exercise dietary caloric restriction , either alone combination , reduce inflammatory oxidative stress burden see obese subject . The impact healthy lifestyle modification inflammation oxidative stress investigate obese CKD population . Based foregoing observation , purpose investigation determine whether healthy lifestyle intervention form low-impact aerobic exercise dietary calorie restriction obese subject ( BMI ≥ 30kg/m2 ) moderate severe ( Stage III-IV ) CKD [ estimate glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) 20-59 ml/min ] improve oxidative stress , inflammation , insulin resistance , adipocytokines , endothelial dysfunction , quality life .</brief_summary>
