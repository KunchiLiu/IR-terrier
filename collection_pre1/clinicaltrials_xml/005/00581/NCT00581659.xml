	<detailed_description>Contact lenses potential affect visual performance various drive situation , include low-visibility situation drive night . This study assess effect typical nighttime drive task read sign avoid road hazard . This single-site study . Individuals currently spherical contact lens wearer , believe little astigmatism , license driver invite partipate study . Twenty-four completed subject require . This study involve 2x2 within-subject comparison . The first independent variable contact lens . Each subject wear PureVision ( TM0 aspheric contact lenses conventional spherical contact lenses separate visit . The second independent variable visibility condition . Subjects complete study drive clear nighttime condition night glare condition . In case , driver experience oncoming traffic ; however , glare condition , simulator equip point light source sufficient provide glare similar provide oncoming traffic real world .</detailed_description>
