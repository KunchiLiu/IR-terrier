	<detailed_description>The intubate , ventilate case dangerous situation , able foresee , prevent , prepare difficulty task every anesthesiologist . Difficult mask ventilation predict number factor , include obesity.1 Appropriate bag-and-mask ventilation necessitate patent airway . An increased BMI associate reduced posterior airway space behind tongue 's base well quick development hypoxemia reduce functional residual capacity improper mask ventilation.1 Proper head neck position establish patent airway especially important . There increase risk difficult laryngoscopy among obese patient compare subject normal body mass index.2,3 Optimal laryngeal view laryngoscopy facilitate proper head neck positioning , include slight elevation head , neck flexion relative chest , extreme atlanto-occipital extension.4 The `` ramp '' position , patient 's ear horizontally align sternal notch , find superior standard `` sniffing '' position , 7-cm occiput elevation , direct laryngoscopy morbidly obese patients.4 Additionally , increase difficulty risk tracheal intubation obese patient versus normal-weight patient . Studies find chance successful first attempt oral intubation decrease patient weight increases.6,7 Improving visualization laryngeal structure increase likelihood successful tracheal intubation , increase percentage glottic opening correlate number intubation attempt , well need rescue intubation devices.8 It estimate endotracheal intubation perform approximately 8 million patient per year United States . Of endotracheal intubation , approximately 80 % perform direct laryngoscopy transoral placement endotracheal tube ( ET ) trachea . There fairly uniform report incidence fail intubation literature ; occur approximately 0.05 % 1:2230 surgical patient approximately 0.13 % 0.35 % , 1:750 1:280 , obstetric patients.9,10 The incidence unsuspected difficult intubation estimate high 3 % . One factor contribute difficult intubation poor visualization , difficult laryngoscopy highly correlate poor laryngeal exposure.11 The Rapid Airway Management Positioner ( RAMP ) design optimize visualization direct laryngoscopy place patient proper head-elevated laryngoscopy position ( HELP ) . In morbidly obese patient , achieve position important,12 require great deal support head shoulder could perform singlehandedly.13 The RAMP easy-to-use , quick device , take average 56 seconds place inflate.14 The RAMP great potential obese patient . Pre-positioning also help increase desaturation safety period morbidly obese patients.15 Rescue ventilation technique facilitate HELP position , head neck elevate chest abdomen . The airway therefore isolate easy work , less positive airway pressure need weight abdomen away diaphragm . Currently , place patient top stack blanket common create HELP , `` ramp '' position , 5 also cause variable unstable result . We suspect provide good laryngeal view , RAMP may help decrease incidence tissue trauma associate intubation , intubation may achieve quickly population know difficult .</detailed_description>
