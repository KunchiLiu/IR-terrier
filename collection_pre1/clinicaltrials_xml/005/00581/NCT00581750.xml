	<brief_summary>This study do order well understand biology abnormal lesion find breast tissue call `` lobular carcinoma situ '' ( LCIS ) . We interested study LCIS . The LCIS cancer , marker increase risk cancer . We would like look LCIS breast tissue remove surgery patient cancer high risk cancer . If LCIS find , search gene express ( turn ) differently normal breast tissue . The identification gene would help u good understand biology LCIS , possible relationship breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Genetic Basis Invasive Breast Cancer Risk Associated With Lobular Carcinoma Situ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LCIS ) monoclonal pathologic entity subject characterization molecular genetic level , molecular genetic alteration may use predict subsequent development invasive breast cancer . Prophylactic mastectomy specimen woman multifocal LCIS , invasive breast cancer specimens display coexist LCIS , examine X-chromosome inactivation pattern loss heterozygosity assess monoclonality . If clonality present , assess microsatellite instability , microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) technique use identify genetic alteration present LCIS . Lastly , LCIS biopsy specimen untreated patient , follow-up develop invasive breast cancer , evaluate determine whether nature extent identify genetic alteration correlate subsequent development invasive breast cancer . We hypothesize fraction LCIS lesion reflect monoclonal origin , lesion monoclonal origin display evidence specific molecular genetic alteration , specific alteration correlate likelihood subsequent development invasive breast carcinoma .</detailed_description>
