	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Doxorubicin Bortezomib Patients With Incurable Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients treat bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 , intravenously day 1 , 4 , 8 11 , doxorubicin 20 mg/m2 , intravenously day 1 8 , every 21 day . Zinecard add 8th cycle subsequent cycle doxorubicin . After completion 14 cycle , progression , bortezomib week dose 1.6 mg/m2 day 1,8,15 , every 28 day , administer alone . Treatment continue unless disease progression intolerable toxicity emerges ( see section 5 detailed treatment plan dose modification ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must locally advance , recurrent , metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma head neck consider incurable known therapy , judge investigator . Patients cytologically histologically confirm adenoid cystic carcinoma head neck . Patients must unidimensionally measurable disease ( RECIST criterion ) . If site measurable disease previously irradiate area , patient must document progression disease area . All available prior compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan review noted , measurement show progression disease document whenever possible . However , documentation disease progression mandatory enrollment . Patients must multigated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) scan showing leave ventricular ejection function ( LVEF ) institutional low limit normal . Patients must ECOG performance status 02 . Patients recover prior surgery radiation therapy . A minimum time period 3 week elapse completion extensive radiation therapy recurrent/metastatic disease enrollment study . Patients must normal organ marrow function ( define ) measure within one week prior registration : Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm3 . Platelets great equal 100,000/mm3 . Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit . Transaminases ( AST ALT ) &lt; 3 X ULN . Creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . CrCl calculate use CockcroftGault formula : Calculated Creatinine Clearance = ( 140age ) X actual body wt . ( kg ) 72 X serum creatinine . Multiply number 0.85 patient female . Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Prior study entry , ECG abnormality screen document investigator medically relevant . Patients must history congestive heart failure grade accord Heart Association ( NYHA ) ( see Appendix 2 ) . Age &gt; 18 year capacity give inform consent . All patient must give sign , informed consent prior registration study . No prior chemotherapy recurrent / metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma . Up 1 prior biologic/targeted therapy regimen allow . Also , chemotherapy part initial potentially curative therapy ( i.e . concurrent chemoradiotherapy ) allow , complete &gt; 6 month earlier . Patients must prior anthracyclines ( doxorubicin , epirubicin , daunorubicin , idarubicin ) mitoxantrone , bortezomib . No history prior malignancy , exception curatively treat squamous cell basal carcinoma skin situ cervical cancer , unless 3year diseasefree interval . Patients must history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition bortezomib , boron mannitol . Patients must preexist neuropathy grade &gt; 1 . Patients must uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Female patient pregnant breast feed patient reproductive potential use effective method birth control exclude . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 2 week first administration chemo . Also , male patient whose sexual partner woman child bear potential use effective birth control exclude . Patients know positivity human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) exclude due possible pharmacokinetic interaction bortezomib . Appropriate study undertake HIVpositive patient receive receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Patient must receive investigational drug within 14 day enrollment .</criteria>
