	<brief_summary>The purpose observational study characterize immune system cell hide latent reservoir HIV counting number latent HIV different subset CD4 cell . Observations also make possible mechanism HIV persistence look cellular factor APOBEC3 drug transporter . The purpose study develop new strategy reduce possibly eliminate latent reservoir HIV infect adult .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Memory CD4 cell may provide reservoir latent HIV completely eliminate use currently available anti-HIV medication . The overall goal observational study develop new strategy eliminate latent HIV reservoir HIV infected individual . CD4-cell subset , cellular anti-HIV factor , cellular drug transporter observe determine rest memory cell hide latent HIV determine mechanism responsible persistence latent HIV reservoir . This study last least 3 year . The screening visit include medical history , contact information , urine collection , physical exam . Participants assign one five group : - Group 1 consist intensively study adult initiate potentially suppressive drug therapy . At screen visit , Group 1 participant give option either undergo blood draw leukapheresis visit . - Group 2 consist intensively study , well-suppressed adult highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . At screen visit , Group 2 participant give option either undergo blood draw leukapheresis visit . - Group 3 consist nonintensively study adult initiate potentially suppressive drug therapy . Group 3 participant undergo blood draw visit . - Group 4 consist nonintensively study , well-suppressed adult HAART . Group 4 participant undergo blood draw visit . - Group 5 consist participant currently Merck Expanded Access Program receiving raltegravir . At screen visit , Group 5 participant give option either undergo blood draw leukapheresis visit . For participant undergo blood draw , visit occur every 3 month 3 year . For patient undergoing leukapheresis , visit occur every 6 month 3 year . At visit , blood collection , documentation current HAART , update contact information occur . Participants encourage provide additional blood sample store visit . Participants Groups 1 , 2 , 5 may decline leukapheresis group time give option continue blood draw group withdraw completely study . If specimen obtain reason visit , participant Groups 1 , 2 , 5 default either Group 3 Group 4 . Antiretroviral medication provide study .</detailed_description>
