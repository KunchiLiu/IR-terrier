	<brief_summary>Radiotherapy show reduce breast-cancer specific mortality patient high risk distant dissemination . It also show increase rate non-breast cancer death morbidity due cardiovascular pulmonary toxicity . Although treatment planning improve significantly year , recent report still demonstrate treatment-related morbidity even 3-dimensional plan technique . Thus , 3D planning represent state art treatment loco-regional radiotherapy breast cancer , improvement need continue decrease heart lung exposure . The ultimate goal propose research determine whether treatment plan use intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) , `` next generation '' radiation treatment delivery system , result le radiation exposure heart lungs best current RT technique woman node positive breast cancer . This proposal test potential clinical value IMRT compare best standard 3D plan ( partially wide tangent field , PWTF ) treatment breast cancer . These two treatment technique study Phase II randomize trial use quantitative indicator potential cardiac lung toxicity . The preliminary data generate trial use ultimately justify multi-institutional comparison two treatment technique long-term clinical cardiac pulmonary toxicity endpoint .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Comparison Radiation Therapy Techniques Management Node Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Primary Objective 1.1 To compare extent new myocardial perfusion defect follow breast cancer radiotherapy use best standard 3-D radiotherapy technique , partially wide tangent field , versus best optimize technique . 2 . Secondary Objectives 2.1 To compare change ejection fraction alteration cardiac wall motion treatment technique 2.2 To compare change lung perfusion defect pulmonary function test ( DLCO , FEV1 , FVC ) technique 2.3 To compare rate pericarditis pneumonitis technique Cardiac Endpoints : Myocardial SPECT-CT perfusion defect , ejection fraction , alteration cardiac wall motion , per SPECT-CT ( adenosine stress rest ( necessary ) ) scan . Pulmonary Endpoints : Lung SPECT-CT perfusion defect per SPECT-CT scan , change pulmonary function test : DLCO , FEV1 , FVC Clinical Endpoints : pericarditis pneumonitis .</detailed_description>
