	<brief_summary>Stem cell develop every cell , every tissue every organ human body , e.g. , make kind cell human body . Stem cell reproduce many time . Their almost limitless potential make stem cell significant focus medical research . But scientist use stem cell medical purpose , must first learn harness power . They treat disease learn manipulate stem cell get develop specific tissue organ . We know turn gene crucial process differentiation , add factor culture dish observe stem cell differentiate specific type cell . But sort signal need actually trigger stem cell differentiate . We still search signal . If ultimately learn direct stem cell differentiate one type tissue another , use treat patient . In proposal , first examine step . We propose novel approach understand differentiation human embryo stem ( hES ) cell , study TBX3 , protein call transcription factor control expression gene . In human , loss function TBX3 cause Ulnar-Mammary Syndrome , genetic disorder pas one generation next . Furthermore , preliminary result show TBX3 downstream mediator another protein , BMP4 . BMP4 known key regulator hES cell differentiation . Thus , TBX3 attractive candidate downstream mediator BMP4 hES cell differentiation . We test TBX3 effect hES cell differentiation down-regulate TBX3 hES cell technology call siRNA knockdown . We identify gene control TBX3 recently invent powerful technology call CHIP-GLAS . This technique allow u examine thousand gene small chip single experiment . We expect innovative experiment propose open new avenue understanding signal hES cell differentiation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PURPOSE OF STUDY The purpose study understand trigger stem cell differentiate one type tissue another . The study TBX3 , protein call transcription factor control expression gene , show downstream mediator protein BMP4 , know key regulator hES cell differentiation . Hypothesis Aims To understand role TBX3 hES cell differentiation , hypothesize TBX3 downstream mediator BMP4 play important role hES cell differentiation . We propose follow specific aim : 1 . To examine TBX3 function hES cell differentiation . NIH approve hES cell culture conditioned medium BMP4 induce differentiation TBX3 expression . TBX3 knock siRNA technology . The cell morphology biochemical change examine effect TBX3 knockdown hES cell differentiation , include test human ÃŸ-CG estradiol progesterone . The gene expression profile also examine Affymetrix gene expression chip verify real-time RT-PCR . 2 . To identify genome-wide downstream target directly bound TBX3 hESC Chromatin immunoprecipitation-guided ligation selection ( CHIP-GLAS ) . To identify target TBX3 BMP4-induced hES cell , perform ChIP-GLAS analysis . CHIP-GLAS novel high-throughput technique combination chromatin precipitation oligonucleotide-based microarray . This technology allow u identify genome-wide downstream target gene directly bound TBX3 hES cell . We expect propose experiment identify key regulator hES cell differentiation open new avenue understand function TBX3 hES cell . The CHIP-GLAS promoter array provide u cut edge tool allow u examine broad function TBX3 . We anticipate study significantly enhance understand TBX3 function hES cell differentiation . STUDY DESIGN NIH-approved cell line available Sue Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Core Facility University California , Irvine . Non-NIH-approved cell line obtain Sue &amp; Bill Gross Stem Cell Core UC Irvine . Environment : Huang Lab currently support Helen Larry Hoag Foundation Susan Komen Foundation . There active grant federal government . Previously , Dr. Huang support K23 R03 grant . They complete 2004 2006 , respectively . No equipment purchase fund federal grant . As equipment currently Huang lab purchase UCI startup fund private fund , conflict government regulation . At University California , Irvine , Sue Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center key component Stem Cell Core Facility . This facility provide stem cell technology resource UCI faculty ( Please see attached letter ) . By merge technical scientific expertise number essential discipline , Core harbor diverse tool kit exploration multiple aspect stem cell biology . The Core also provide knowledge base differentiating , genetically modify assay human embryonic stem cell ( hESCs ) support multiple stem cell project campus surround area . All service procedure perform accordance good quality assurance record keep practice pursuant standard operating procedure good laboratory practice . The Sue Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center The human embryonic stem ( hES ) cell core facility Sue Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center open April 2006 . It occupy approximately 10,000 square foot space research park immediately adjacent University California , Irvine campus . Approximately $ 1.7 million committed UCI fully equip facility aspect hES cell research . Further gift total $ 236,687 Fuji Foundation Nichols Foundation provide additional major equipment supply available investigator . The facility set Federal-free zone investigator carry aspect hES cell research . Individual room equip tissue culture biosafety cabinet , CO2 incubator , invert microscope , dissect microscope , digital imaging equipment , centrifuge , water bath dedicate refrigerator freezer . Ten tissue culture set-ups well standard lab bench space available UCI investigator visitor . The facility also major piece equipment need hES cell analysis Zeiss 510 Meta Two-Photon Confocal Microscope . The facility shortly BD LSR II Flow cytometer BD FacsAria cell sorter . Pretested reagent available investigator core facility . These include medium component , growth factor , feeder cell , gelatin , Matrigel , antibodies primer assay stem cell marker expression . In addition , core facility assist karyotype analysis tumor formation test hES cell .</detailed_description>
