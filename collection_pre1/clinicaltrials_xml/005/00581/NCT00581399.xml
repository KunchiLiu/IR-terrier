	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare new high vacuum pressure chest drainage system ( NO-NUMO™ ) standard low vacuum pressure drainage system already use cardiac surgery . The new system use small diameter drainage tube remove blood chest open heart surgery . This less painful patient help patient breathe good operation . Preliminary data suggest high vacuum suction effective practical , could actually reduce amount chest tube bleed surgery without compromise heart function . This new high vacuum drainage system approve FDA 2002 . Subsequent test University California , Irvine indicate unique system may allow surgeon predict excessive postoperative bleeding patient transfer operating room , thus add safety , convenience , cost effectiveness use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Multicenter Clinical Study On High Vacuum Body Cavity Drainage System Following Open Heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High vacuum chest drainage consider inadvisable possible suction injury soft tissue , lung mediastinum . Wakabayashi show excessive suction force generate high vacuum pressure relate surface area suction apply tissue vacuum pressure itself1 &amp; 2 . He postulate suction injury lung would occur suction force chest tube capillary blood pressure 30 - 35 torr2 . Based theory , Wakabayashi develop double-lumen chest drainage tube3 ( Trade name NO-NUMO™ ) clinical use approve FDA4 2002 . A prototype 7-5Fr double-lumen chest tube successfully test laboratory animal three patients1 &amp; 2 safety high vacuum chest drainage proven large number patient undergo uncomplicated thoracoscopic surgeries2 . The unique design new drainage tube small diameter double lumen tube hundred tiny hole allow rapid drainage without damage effect high suction limit surface area . High vacuum suction available wall unit already place OR ICU bed . To adopt system clinical use , high vacuum gauge need ( n't go beyond 200 torr ) monitor suction , high pressure battery power vacuum pump transport necessary , drainage maintain blood clot tube avoid period prolong transport OR setup ICU . Several brand portable vacuum pump market evaluate conclude Vario™ pump ( Medela® Inc. ) superior . The maximal vacuum pressure Vario pump generate 630 torr 84 kPa equivalent -857 cmH2O . The NO-NUMO™ High Vacuum Body Cavity Drainage System consist ; ( 1 ) disposable NO-NUMO™ body cavity drainage tube , ( 2 ) disposable Vario™ fluid management canister ( 3 ) Vario™ portable vacuum pump . We evaluate new system , use 13Fr triple-tube set mediastinal drainage , 13Fr single-tube leave pleural drainage two 13Fr NO-NUMO tube drainage low extremity subcutaneous wound follow harvest saphenous vein . The tubing connect disposable liner Medi-Vac™ ( Cardinal Health , Inc. ) suction canister , connect Vario pump 300 torr ( = 40 kPa ) patient follow open heart surgery .</detailed_description>
