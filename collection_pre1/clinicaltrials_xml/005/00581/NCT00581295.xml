	<brief_summary>Trauma remain leading cause death disability Americans age 1-44 . Trauma cause internal bleeding , bleed often hard detect without sophisticate test take time complete analyze . In addition , internal bleeding , include bleed lung chest cavity , well blood loss , happen many critically ill patient . For example , hemorrhage , difficult detect active hemorrhage determine optimal rate fluid blood resuscitation . Diffuse optical spectroscopy potential accurately assess adequacy tissue perfusion , oxygenation , tissue oxygen extraction , cytochrome oxidation state may critical optimal treatment , end- organ preservation , survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Evaluation Trauma/Critically Care Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research ' want monitor tissue perfusion indicator tissue damage viability critically ill patient use DOS . Non-invasive Optical Techniques DOS , near-infrared diffuse optical spectroscopy ( NIR-DOS . NIR-DOS provide functional physiologic tissue/organ information without ionize radiation without withdraw blood , cost-effective rapid manner . The application frequency-domain photon migration analysis ( FDPM ) NIRS allow independent measurement tissue absorption scatter property depths 1 cm skin surface . Such capability improve early diagnosis , detection , optimization therapy , assessment adequacy resuscitation , alteration management plan critical condition .</detailed_description>
