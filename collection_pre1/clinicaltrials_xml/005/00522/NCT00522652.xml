	<criteria>The patient sign informed consent must consider legally capable provide consent participation study . The patient histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis advance solid tumor lymphoma fail intolerant standard therapy . The patient ≥18 year age . ECOG performance status 0 1 . The patient predict life expectancy least 12 week . Patients must discontinue prior chemotherapy investigational agent least three week prior receive first dose study drug ( six week mitomycin C , nitrosureas , vaccine , antibody therapy ) recover toxic effect treatment ( recovered baseline ≤Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) grade 1 ) . Patients must discontinue radiation therapy least four week prior entry study recover radiationrelated toxicity ( recovered baseline ≤CTCAE grade 1 ) . The patient adequate hematologic function define : WBC count &gt; 3,000 cells/μL ; platelet &gt; 100,000/μL ; hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL ( may transfuse level ) ; ANC &gt; 1500 cells/μL . The patient adequate hepatic function define : bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL ; aspartate aminotransaminase ( AST/SGOT ) &amp; alanine aminotransferase ( ALT/SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 x ULN &lt; 5 x ULN due metastatic disease . The patient adequate renal function define serum creatinine level &lt; 1.5 mg/dL . Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . The patient , man , agree use effective contraception abstinence . Patients active infection require i.v . antibiotic study entry . Any serious concomitant systemic disorder opinion investigator would place patient excessive unacceptable risk toxicity . Surgery within four week prior first dose PX 478 . Significant central nervous system ( CNS ) psychiatric disorder ( ) preclude ability patient provide inform consent . Known suspected brain metastasis receive adequate therapy . In case previously treat brain metastasis , minimum four week interval completion radiation therapy registration study radiologic evidence stable respond brain metastasis require . In set previous CNS metastasectomy , adequate ( minimum four week ) recovery surgery and/or radiation therapy document . Patients history seizure , nonhealing wound , arterial thrombosis . Patients unstable atrial ventricular arrhythmia require control medication ; cardiac ischemic event experience within precede six month ; prior history congestive heart failure require therapy . Patients breastfeed pregnant ( confirm serum βHCG within 10 day prior start study treatment applicable ) . Patients total gastrectomy partial bowel obstruction . Any condition could jeopardize safety patient compliance protocol .</criteria>
