	<detailed_description>An ICD device design quickly detect life-threatening , rapid heartbeat . Through process call defibrillation , ICD try convert abnormal heart rhythm back normal deliver electrical shock heart . The ICD continuously monitor heartbeats ensure normal , delivers shock heart sense life-threatening rhythm . People experience ventricular fibrillation , severely abnormal heart rhythm , ventricular tachycardia , rapid heart beat begin bottom chamber heart , common recipient ICD . Other potential ICD recipient include people survive heart attack , weak heart ; people heart muscle problem ; people reduce pump function heart . People ICDs may benefit aerobic exercise improve physical fitness overall health . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness exercise program improve heart lung function people ICD . In 6-month study , participant randomly assign either take part exercise program receive usual care . At baseline study visit , participant complete exercise treadmill test , wear Holter monitor record heart activity 24 hour , undergo blood collection , complete questionnaire assess quality life , anxiety , depression . Participants take part exercise program receive 1 hour exercise education telephone . During Weeks 1 8 , participant stretch 10 minute walk 1 hour daily 5 day week ; Weeks 9 24 , participant walk 30 minute daily 5 day week . Participants wear Polar Heart Rate monitor record heart rate pedometer keep track number step walk . They also record detail exercise daily activity log . Throughout entire study , study nurse call participant weekly basis check progress help resolve exercise-related problem . At Weeks 8 24 , participant include receive usual care , attend study visit repeat baseline evaluation . Study researcher review medical record collect various information , include reason need ICD , type setting ICD , medication use , medical history , current health problem , lab test result , echocardiogram image heart , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) result .</detailed_description>
