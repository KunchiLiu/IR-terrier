	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS AND HYPOTHESES Aim 1 : To determine whether 12-week , computer-based mental activity program improve cognitive function non-demented , inactive elder . We hypothesize mental activity program improve cognitive function—especially visuospatial function—in non-demented , inactive elder . Aim 2 : To determine whether 12-week exercise program improve cognitive function non-demented , inactive elder . We hypothesize exercise program improve cognitive function—especially executive function—in non-demented , inactive elder . Aim 3 : To determine whether effect mental activity exercise additive less sum part . We hypothesize effect mental activity exercise intervention additive . Aim 4 : To determine whether mental activity and/or exercise may slow cognitive decline low risk dementia non-demented , inactive elder . We hypothesize mental activity exercise slow cognitive decline low risk dementia , effect great mental activity exercise combine .</detailed_description>
