	<brief_summary>This open-label , multicenter , multiple-dose , Phase I-II study CHR-2797 co-administered erlotinib patient histologically pathologically confirm Stage IIIB ( pleural effusion ) , Stage IV , recurrent metastatic NSCLC . Throughout protocol , `` study medication '' include CHR-2797 erlotinib . This study involve 2 distinct study phase . Study Phase A ass safety determine MTD combination CHR-2797 erlotinib . In addition , PK profile combination CHR-2797 erlotinib evaluate . In Study Phase B , dose chosen base maximum tolerate dose establish Study Phase A administer single-arm treatment design order evaluate efficacy co-administration CHR-2797 erlotinib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Safety Effectiveness CHR-2797 With Erlotinib Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Phase A : Maximum tolerate dose determined Cycle 1 . Tumor assessment make Cycle 2 ( 56 day ) , although mandatory Phase A patient measurable disease . Patients satisfactory outcome Cycle 2 may continue treatment year erlotinib 150 mg/day , dose CHR-2797 receive Study Phase A . Study Phase B : Patients treat dose CHR-2797 select Study Phase A 150mg/day erlotinib . Patients receive 2 cycle treatment ( 56 day ) efficacy assessment . Patients complete response , partial response , stable disease eligible continue study year disease progression unacceptable toxicity . If patient complete response , partial response , stable disease end 1-year study period Investigator believe continuation treatment would beneficial , patient may continue treat dose CHR-2797 separate protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically and/or pathologically confirm NSCLC ( cytologic specimen obtain brushing , wash , needle aspiration define lesion acceptable ) . This include histologic subtypes squamous cell , adeno , large cell , anaplastic cell , bronchioalveolar carcinoma , NSCLC otherwise specify ( NOS ) . Note tumor presence small cell anaplastic element eligible 2 . NSCLC documentation Stage IIIB ( pleural effusion ) , Stage IV , recurrent metastatic disease base current TNM classification 3 . Disease progression relapse follow failure platinumbased chemotherapy 4 . For Study Phase A , patient require measurable disease ( accord RECIST criterion ) enrollment . For patient Study Phase B , patient must measurable disease accord RECIST , define least 1 lesion accurately measure . All lesion ( e.g. , pleural effusion ) include small lesion ( &lt; 1 cm×1 cm spiral CT scan ) consider nonmeasurable purpose study . Baseline tumor measurement complete close possible , longer 14 day start study treatment 5 . Prior radiation measurable site ( ) disease allow , unless disease progression document site since radiotherapy . Patients extensive radiotherapy also exclude , associate myelosuppressive effect 6 .
