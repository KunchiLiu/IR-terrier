	<brief_summary>Trachoma lead infectious cause blindness worldwide . Recurrent infection Chlamydia trachomatis cause in-turning eyelid / lash ( trichiasis ) , lead corneal damage blindness . The WHO recommend corrective eyelid surgery trichiasis . Unfortunately , trichiasis frequently return follow surgery . The purpose study compare outcome surgery ( one two year ) trichiasis use two currently use alternative suture type : non-absorbable ( silk ) absorbable ( vicryl ) . We , researcher , hypothesise supportive presence absorbable suture longer period produce stable wound healing , lead well outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Non-absorbable Versus Absorbable Sutures Trichiasis Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary outcome measure : Recurrent trichiasis , define one eyelash touch globe evidence epilation ( lash stub ) examination , history repeat trichiasis surgery since baseline surgery , one year . Justification primary outcome : The aim surgery permanent solution trichiasis . If patient eyelash touch eyeball clinical evidence epilate prevent require repeat trichiasis surgery , surgery deem failure . Analysis primary outcome measure Intention treat analysis risk factor recurrence . Primary analysis primary outcome : It expect important baseline characteristic ( know affect risk recurrence ) balance two arm stratify ( operate surgeon ) randomisation . If find case , outcome surgery two arm compare unadjusted logistic regression model recurrent trichiasis one year . If arm find substantially imbalanced respect , pre-operative severity , gender age , appropriately adjust logistic regression model use . Individuals consider recurrent trichiasis case develop recurrent trichiasis anytime one year follow-up period . Secondary analysis primary outcome : 1 . Effect modification We assess effect modification intervention recurrence one year follow factor include interaction term treatment arm logistic regression model . 1 . Operating surgeon 2 . Pre-operative severity 3 . Sex 4 . Age group 5 . Conjunctival ( papillary ) inflammation 6 . Surgical complication 2 . Analysis risk factor recurrence : A multivariate logistic regression model use identify potential explanatory factor recurrent trichiasis one year , addition randomise suture type allocation . Other factor examine model recurrent trichiasis include 1. pre-operative disease severity - trichiasis - entropion - corneal opacity 2. surgeon 3. infection status baseline follow timepoints 4. inflammation status baseline follow timepoints 5. whether epilation practise 6. sex 7. age 8. geographic location patient 's home 9. literacy 10. body mass index 11. eye dryness - symptom - sign 3 . Impact intervention time-to-first-recurrence . Kaplan-Meier analysis use plot survival curve treatment arm final visit 2 year . Cox regression use assess impact intervention time first recurrence . The hazard ratio estimate Cox regression , adjust substantial baseline imbalance appropriate . 4 . Recurrence two year Intention-to-treat analysis use assess impact intervention failure 2 year . Failure define one eyelash touch globe evidence epilation ( lash stub ) examination , history repeat trichiasis surgery since baseline surgery , either one year and/or two year follow-up visit . Secondary outcome measure 1 . Lashes touch eyeball The effect intervention number lash touch one , two year , respectively , analyse use zero inflate Poisson regression ( i.e . treat number lash continuous variable ) 2 . Entropion grade The effect intervention degree entropion analyse order logistic regression 3 . Conjunctivilisation lid margin grade The effect intervention degree conjunctivilisation analyse order logistic regression 4 . Clinical evidence epilation The effect intervention clinical evidence epilation assess one two year respectively logistic regression . In addition , Cox regression use analyse time-to-first evidence epilation . 5 . Repeat surgery The effect intervention proportion repeat surgery assess one two year respectively logistic regression . In addition , Cox regression use analyse time-to-first evidence first repeat surgery . 6 . Recurrence ( lash touch eyeball , clinical evidence epilation , repeat surgery ) + history epilation A secondary definition recurrence incorporate self-reported history epilation . The primary analysis repeat definition recurrence . 7 . Corneal opacification ( CO ) ( categorical variable ) 1 . Descriptive measure baseline severity CO 2 . Description change CO baseline one two year follow time-points . 3 . Ordered logistic regression analysis factor associate change CO one year two year , respectively , include identify factor associate , suture type inflammation . 8 . Visual acuity ( VA ) ( categorical variable ) The effect intervention visual acuity ( logMAR score ) 12 24 month analyse linear regression . 9 . Surgical complication Surgical complication recurrence , granuloma , incomplete lid closure , inflammation ( secondary either two suture material ) infection occur . Descriptive statistic , significance test use compare rate occurrence complication individual complication time study period two arm study . 10 . Patient satisfaction Patients ask following question follow questionnaire indicate satisfaction procedure : 1 . Do think vision bad , good surgery ? 2 . Do eye pain ? 3 . If eye pain worse , good operation ? 4 . Do eye water ? 5 . Did find surgery painful ? 6 . If eyelash return return would seek surgery ? The proportion answer 'yes ' question compare two arm trial . Additionally answer question ( b ) ( ) compare baseline ( pre-operative ) answer give time point within arm .</detailed_description>
