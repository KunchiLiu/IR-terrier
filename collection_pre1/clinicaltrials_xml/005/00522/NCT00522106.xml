	<brief_summary>We perform randomize control trial study effectiveness Behavioral grade activity ( BGA ) patient OA hip knee . It hypothesise long term BGA result less pain , less limitation activity , good patient global assessment ( i.e . effect treatment perceive patient ) , compare usual care physiotherapist ( UC ) . UC operationalized physiotherapeutic care accord Dutch physiotherapy guideline patient hip and/or knee OA . It also investigate whether specific subgroup patient benefit BGA factor influence success BGA-treatment . Also , investigate whether difference exist exercise adherence whether relationship exercise adherence long-term effectiveness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Behavioral Graded Activity Patients With Osteoarthritis Hip and/or Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principle objectives manage OA control pain adequately , improve function reduce disability . There strong evidence exercise therapy short term benefit OA . However , beneficial effect decrease time finally disappear . This decline think related difficulty people maintain adherence prescribe exercise . Therefore , enhance long term benefit , adherence exercise therapy utmost importance . Recently , focus attention within physiotherapy shift towards behaviorally orient treatment , like Behavioral Graded Activity ( BGA ) , focus less pain include psychological social factor treatment-process . Such intervention seem appropriate increase level activity patient OA time-contingent way increase patient ' adherence activity . However , start present study scientific evidence effectiveness BGA patient progressive specific chronic disease , like OA hip knee , available . Therefore , perform randomize control trial study effectiveness BGA patient OA hip knee . It hypothesise long term BGA result less pain , less limitation activity , good patient global assessment ( i.e . effect treatment perceive patient ) , compare usual care physiotherapist ( UC ) . UC operationalized physiotherapeutic care accord Dutch physiotherapy guideline patient hip and/or knee OA . It also investigate whether specific subgroup patient benefit BGA factor influence success BGA-treatment . Also , investigate whether difference exist exercise adherence whether relationship exercise adherence long-term effectiveness .</detailed_description>
