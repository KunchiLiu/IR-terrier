	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether difference blood sugar control ( measure hemoglobin A1c ( HA1c ) ) , child give twice daily insulin injection incorporate new long acting insulin analogue ( detemir ) compare child use current three time day insulin injection ( intermediate rapid act insulin ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Twice Daily Versus Three Times Daily Insulin Regimen Children With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children type 1 diabetes ( DM1 ) treat subcutaneous insulin present time Canada . It show intensive insulin treatment use least three time daily ( TID ) insulin injection achieve superior blood glucose control less long term complication diabetes conventional insulin treatment use daily ( OD ) twice daily ( BID ) insulin injection . However , many patient find difficult adhere TID insulin injection since invasive painful therapy , result frequent insulin omission . This study randomize control open-labeled non-inferiority trial compare glycemic control measure HbA1c 6 month BID insulin regimen use detemir insulin , currently use TID insulin intermediate act insulin ( Novolin NPH Humulin N ) . Patients randomize either active control group ( standard TID regimen ) treatment group ( BID regimen new long act insulin analogue ) . A run-in period 1 month use facilitate change insulin regimen . Insulin dose adjusted weekly phone contact research nurse one month prior baseline blood work . Patients continue diet exercise routine recommend usual diabetes team . They also see every 3 month research nurse review blood glucose , assess height weight arrange blood work do conjunction routine bloodwork . All patient continue see usual diabetologist , nurse , dietician regularly schedule clinic visit ( every 3 month ) . Outcomes include : HA1c group 6 month ( surrogate marker metabolic control diabetes measure venous capillary blood sample ) , frequency adverse event ( severe hypoglycemia , mild hypoglycemia , episodes diabetic ketoacidosis , weight gain ) , diabetes quality life youth ( DQOL ) .</detailed_description>
