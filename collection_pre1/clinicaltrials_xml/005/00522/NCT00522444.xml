	<brief_summary>Nebulized Magnesium Sulfate show benefit adult acute asthma exacerbation , though limited work do pediatric population . Current therapeutic question include effect one dose nebulized magnesium , possibility sustain effect ( great 20 minute ) treatment , potential benefit child young 5 year age , use asthma score re-assess patient treatment medication . The purpose double-blind randomize placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluate effect multiple dos nebulized magnesium sulfate versus saline addition standard asthma therapy clinical asthma score FEV1 child 7 18 year age moderate severe acute asthma exacerbation . Our hypothesis nebulized magnesium sulfate , add traditional bronchodilator therapy , improve acute asthma exacerbation rapidly standard therapy alone . The primary outcome asthma score FEV1 value obtain two nebulized magnesium sulfate compare placebo treatment . This therapy supplemental standard therapy albuterol ipratropium nebulized treatment systemic corticosteroid . The secondary outcome patient disposition ( discharge home hospitalization ) . Patients know asthma approached enrollment inform consent obtain asthma score first albuterol treatment `` 2 '' great . One hundred-seventy patient enrol randomized either treatment group placebo group . The change baseline asthma score FEV1 value compare among control treatment group assess benefit addition nebulized magnesium sulfate treatment regimen .</brief_summary>
