	<brief_summary>High blood pressure affect nearly one third individual United States . It believe genetic factor may predispose people develop disease . This study identify characterize variation three gene know play part development high blood pressure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Genes That Predispose People Develop High Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High blood pressure one common health problem country . It cause many factor , include stress , diet , diabetes , kidney disease , obesity . In many people , identifiable cause high blood pressure . If high blood pressure go untreated , lead heart failure , kidney failure , stroke . Previous study show variation three gene chromosome 1—ATP1B1 , RGS5 , SELE—cause people susceptible develop high blood pressure . All three gene involve development protein play role regulate blood pressure , know exactly variation gene affect blood pressure level . This study examine previously collect genetic sample participant two clinical trial , GenNet study Heredity Phenotype Interaction ( HAPI ) Heart study . Study researcher analyze sample identify characterize variation ATP1B1 , RGS5 , SELE gene . Results study may lead effective diagnostic treatment option people high blood pressure .</detailed_description>
