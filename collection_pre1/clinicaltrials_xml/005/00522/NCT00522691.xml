	<brief_summary>Sacral nerve stimulation ( SNS ) emerge treatment patient severe fecal incontinence . The test stimulation minimally invasive , associate low morbidity relatively cheap . On contrary , implantation definite stimulator relate high morbidity considerable cost . A careful patent selection definite implantation therefore crucial . However , indication implantation actually base subjective criterion report patientsÂ´ diary . Patients care provider likely overestimate real effect SNS lead unjustified overuse expensive device . It therefore necessary evaluate real efficacy SNS test phase unbiased set order avoid unnecessary morbidity cost .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sacral nerve stimulation ( SNS ) emerge treatment patient severe faecal incontinence conservative measure fail surgical repair indicate . In minimally-invasive approach local anaesthesia , electrode place around sacral nerve root S2-4 electrical stimulation apply sacral spinal nerve . Effectiveness SNS definitively explain placebo effect pathophysiologic mechanism remain unclear . Suggested pathway include modulation afferent nerve fibre direct stimulation pelvic floor anal sphincter muscle . After placement electrode , patient stimulate external stimulator 1-3 week . During period , patient document number faecal incontinence episode urgency symptom diary . By convention , indication permanent stimulation base 50 % reduction number episode . After successful test period , permanent stimulator implant , generally upper gluteal region . Previous study report success rate 80 % . The randomized trial proper sample size evaluate efficacy SNS definite implantation . In study , 63 % patient felt improved placebo period might really benefit device . The real success rate SNS therefore likely considerably low . Efficacy SNS test phase never assess blind randomize study .</detailed_description>
