	<brief_summary>Inter-individual variability energetic cost running may partly explain low limbs mechanical characteristic . The transposition muscle mechanical model two component ( contractile elastic ) whole low limb mechanical behavior analysis run . The main aim present investigation study effect low limb mechanical characteristic ( force , velocity , stiffness ) energetic cost run use low limb mechanical approach include contractile elastic components.Twenty healthy men run treadmill 12km.h-1 8 different 5 min-conditions . Through condition , stride frequency , sole stiffness subject 's body weight change allow artificial variation low limb mechanical characteristic . Energetic non-invasive mechanical measurement analysis perform obtain energetic cost run compute force , velocity stiffness lower limbs condition .</brief_summary>
