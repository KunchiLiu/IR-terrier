	<brief_summary>`` Elesclomol ( STA-4783 ) , N-malonyl-bis ( N'-methyl-N'-thiobenzoylhydrazide ) new chemical entity novel structure . STA-4783 induces oxidative stress response cell . This response characterize increase production gene family protect different cellular stress , include excessive heat , presence reactive oxygen specie oxygen radical , presence heavy metal . Subjects participate 2 week screening time complete screening procedure . Eligible subject receive prior cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent melanoma randomize 1:1 ratio receive either STA-4783 213 mg/m2 combination paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 alone . One treatment cycle consist weekly treatment 3 week , follow 1-week rest period . Cycles repeat every 4 week disease progression . Tumor assessment perform every 8 week date randomization sooner Investigator suspect progression occur base clinical sign symptoms. ``</brief_summary>
