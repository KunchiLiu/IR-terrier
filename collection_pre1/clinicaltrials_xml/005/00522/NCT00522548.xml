	<brief_summary>Myfortic ( enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium ) show similar effectiveness CellCept ( mycophenolate mofetil ) prevent rejection kidney transplant recipient . However , Myfortic think possibly associate few gastrointestinal side effect . CellCept Myfortic pharmacokinetics ( drug absorb break ) well-studied African American kidney transplant recipient . The investigator interested study Myfortic CellCept pharmacokinetics gastrointestinal side effect African American kidney transplant recipient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Gastrointestinal Side Effects African American Kidney Transplant Recipients Treated With CellCept Myfortic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>African American patient often experience gastrointestinal complication kidney transplant Caucasian patient . In addition , African American kidney transplant recipient also experience high incidence acute rejection bad outcome compare ethnic group . Reasons account difference well understood . In light increase risk GI complication African American patient , compare pilot study , different regimen ( describe ) commonly use clinical practice population . As part study , patient also fill GSRS survey specify time point help describe gastrointestinal side effect transplant . Pharmacokinetic study ( study look drug absorb break ) Cellcept Myfortic largely perform Caucasian population . There little information available African-American patient . This particularly concern face bad clinical outcome observe transplantation African American kidney transplant recipient . Comparisons : Patients randomize one two group - Group 1 : Myfortic ( enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium ) combination Prograf ( tacrolimus ) generic equivalent corticosteroid - Group 2 : CellCept ( mycophenolate mofetil ) generic equivalent combination Prograf ( tacrolimus ) generic equivalent corticosteroid Since toxicity Cellcept Myfortic may influence pharmacokinetics ( study look drug absorbed break ) respective drug , compare pharmacokinetics Myfortic CellCept subset patient . This pharmacokinetic data may additional valuable benefit help optimize dose parameter Cellcept Myfortic African American kidney transplant patient future .</detailed_description>
