	<brief_title>Harmonic Versus Electro Surgery Lower Body Lift Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower Body Lift procedure perform correct skin redundancy muscle diastasis cause significant weight loss , poor skin tone , etc . Lower Body Lift procedures involve high risk early complication , include hematoma , seromas , necrosis , wound-healing problem . The occurrence complication may due part extensive undermining division superficial deep arterial system , do conventional procedure . Persistent serous wound drainage seromas common complication Lower Body Lift procedure . The rate serous fluid collection determines time drain need remain place . Although suction drain reduce seroma formation , prolong use delay healing , cause injury , increase risk retrograde infection patient discomfort . Wound drainage direct correlation seroma formation . The loss protein nutrient mineral serum drain also concern prolonged drainage result healing delay . The Harmonic™ technology use ultrasonic energy allows cut coagulate precise point application . The Harmonic™ use since 1992 predominantly urology gastro-intestinal surgery ( laparoscopic surgery ) . Significantly reduce serous drainage number general surgery procedures superficial total parotidectomy ; thyroidectomy ; tonsillectomy ; pectoralis major myocutaneous flap dissection ; axillary dissection ; lymphadenectomy report use Harmonic™ . The Harmonic™ also use parotidectomy maxillofacial surgery , use seldom mention field plastic reconstructive surgery . Recent use Harmonic™ show promise plastic reconstructive surgery dissection pectoralis major myocutaneous flap total body lift . Comparisons : The Harmonic™ vs. Electro Surgery Lower Body Lift procedure .</detailed_description>
