	<brief_summary>This study seek elucidate fetal neurobehavioral development fetus opioid dependent woman either undergone complete methadone detoxification , never receive methadone maintenance , methadone maintain 36 week gestation . This research determine fetal neurobehavioral functioning fetus opioid dependent , non-methadone maintain woman differs fetus whose opioid dependent mother methadone maintain . The project utilize state-of-the-art computerized fetal actocardiograph data analysis program simultaneously evaluate fetal movement heart rate , interaction two maternal physiologic parameter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project examine fetal neurobehavior non-methadone maintain , opioid dependent woman . Subjects outpatient Center Addiction Pregnancy Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center campus , age 18 40 , either complete methadone detoxification prior 32 week gestation opiate replacement therapy 32 week gestation , never receive methadone maintenance , free maternal know fetal health complication . Women consent 32 week gestation . During four week consent fetal testing , woman privately interview project staff administer SCLR-90 ( Symptom Checklist ) ASRS ( Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale ) , PSD ( Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale ) . These tool use detect symptom different psychological domain ( SCLR-90 ) , ADHD ( ASRS ) PTSD ( PSD ) . At 36 week gestation , woman undergo fetal monitoring . Maternal demographic data ( i.e . substance use history , pregnancy history , methadone dose , medication ) abstract maternal chart prior session . Women ask series question ( SOWS , Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale Adjective Questionnaire ) , via standardized questionnaire use detect presence absence withdrawal symptomatology prior session . Women undergo two 60 minute fetal monitoring session day . The timing two session provide two historical control group . The first session occur 9 AM . The second session occur 1 P.M . The use two fetal test time alleviate problem fetal circadian rhythm would otherwise confound one group . The data acquisition perform use standard fetal monitoring system ( Toitu 325 ) . Data record include fetal movement fetal heart rate . Additional data record include maternal EKG via 3 electrode place maternal chest ( right mid sub-clavicle , leave mid-axillary thorax ) upper leave thigh ( ground lead ) , maternal respiration via bellow apparatus attach around maternal chest beneath breast , maternal contraction via transducer detects fetal movement fetal heart rate , maternal skin conductance , electrodermal activity via two electrode gel skin contact area place index middle finger one hand affix adhesive collar limit gel contact 1 cm circle , velcro . This maternal data time synchronize analyzed conjunction fetal data . Also plan observation fetal response externally apply sound ( baby rattle ) . At conclusion 60 minute session , additional 6 minute recording add , three sound stimuli 1 minute interval . Infants undergo neurobehavioral test day # 3 life . This test consist administration NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale ( NNNS ) , standardize 30-minute harmless painless evaluation infant 's motor , sensory neurologic capability . The exam evaluate infant 's response auditory visual stimulus , well movement , reflex , sign stress consolability . Infants also undergo assessment vagal tone first third day life . This assessment involve obtain 8-10 minute rest heart rate via 3 standard infant EKG lead infant quiet state . The EKG lead connect directly Physio-control EKG monitor ( R wave Medical Electronics Florida ) . This reading transmit vagal tone monitor ( Delta Biometrics , Inc. ) computer data storage off-line analysis . Software use computer heart period vagal tone measure . All fetal testing procedure obtain part protocol experimental ; none use clinical purpose . Women consent participation continue receive routine care CAP . Participants remove protocol relapse licit illicit substance time consent ( 32 week gestation ) time fetal testing ( 36 week gestation ) .</detailed_description>
