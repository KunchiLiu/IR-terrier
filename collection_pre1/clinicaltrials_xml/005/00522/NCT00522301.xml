	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well sorafenib work treat patient ovarian epithelial cancer , fallopian tube cancer , peritoneal cancer least second remission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Peritoneal Cancer Least Second Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine 12-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate woman ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer second great remission treat oral sorafenib tosylate . Secondary - To determine safety tolerability prolong treatment oral sorafenib tosylate woman history recurrent ovarian cancer . - To correlate serum marker angiogenesis ( i.e. , VEGF bFGF ) tumor marker pAKT , HIF-1 α , VEGF 12-month PFS . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral sorafenib twice day day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo tumor tissue blood sample collection baseline , every 12 week study , completion study therapy pharmacokinetic study . Samples analyze soluble marker angiogenesis ( i.e. , VEGF bFGF ) via ELISA HIF-1 α , VEGF , pAKT via IHC stain . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
