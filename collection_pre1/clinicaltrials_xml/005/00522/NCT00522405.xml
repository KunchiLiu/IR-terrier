	<brief_summary>Background Hepatocellular carcinoma , malignant tumor liver one common cancer worldwide . All India Institute Of Medical Sciences ( AIIMS ) tertiary care hospital receives two three case Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) day Gastroenterology patient department . Most patient present late disease already advance curative therapy offer . At stage , palliative therapy form mainstay treatment . This include TACE Oral chemotherapy . Whether oral chemotherapy administer along TACE potentiates effect prolongs survival , need ascertain . No study kind available . This prospective study therefore design address issue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Control Trial ( RCT ) Transarterial Chemoembolization ( TACE ) Versus TACE Oral Drug Therapy Treatment Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Subjects Consecutive patient unresectable HCC diagnose January 2006 liver clinic , AIIMS include study fulfill follow criteria- Inclusion criterion · Patients 12 year age performance status ( PST ) score 0-2 · Unresectable HCC underlie Child 's A/B cirrhosis · Normal Main portal vein branch - Normal Inferior vena cava - No history drug allergy - Informed write consent patient . - Less 50 % involvement liver HCC Exclusión criterion · Unresectable HCC underlie Child 's C cirrhosis · Performance status 3-5 · Extrahepatic disease · Vascular involvement - Co-morbid illness like coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , chronic renal failure etc - Previous history encephalopathy/ upper gastrointestinal bleed last six month - HCC female child bear age 2 . Diagnostic criterion - Cirrhosis liver- Diagnosis found basis clinical , biochemical endoscopy finding . - Hepatocellular carcinoma- one follow present 1 . Any two imaging modality ( Ultrasound ( US ) , dual phase CT ( DPCT ) / contrast enhanced MRI ) show arterialization hepatic mass 2 . AFP 400ng/ml along arterialisation one imaging modality ( DPCT/ contrast enhance MRI ) 3 . FNAC 3 . Randomization · Patients randomized confirmation diagnosis obtain write consent · Sequences generate Statistician · Stratified randomization do . Two strata child 's A B make · Randomization do draw consecutively number opaque seal envelope · Randomization A ( TACE ) B ( TACE +oral chemotherapy ) do . 4 . Definitions 1 . Unresectable HCC- · Liver mass large 5cm diameter ( single/ multiple ) , involve less 50 % liver . · Multiple mass three number 3cm diameter . 2 . Tumor response This base Dual phase CT finding · Complete response ( CR ) - Tumor fully cover lipiodol show viable tissue - Partial response ( PR ) - Tumor partially cover ( &gt; 75 % ) lipiodol - Mild response ( MR ) - About 50 75 % coverage tumor lipiodol - No response ( NR ) - About 25 50 % coverage tumor lipiodol - Fresh lesion ( FL ) - Appearance new mass lesion liver without recurrence site previous mass 3 . Patient tolerance- Grade 1 : side effect Grade 2 : moderate side effect Grade 3 : severe side effect Grade 4 : life threaten side effect 4 . Performance status ( PST score ) PST score 0-5 would assess follow basis 0- No cancer relate symptom . Normal life style 1- Minor symptom related cancer . Capable non-strenuous activity . Fully ambulatory 2- Ambulatory capable self care unable carry work activity Confined bed less 50 % waking hour 3- Capable limit self care . Confined bed 50 % waking hour . 4- Completely disabled . Can carry self care . Totally confined bed . 5- Death 5 . Sample Size Systematic review RCTs TACE show 2 year survival 37 % . Expecting addition oral drug would increase survival 37 60 % , power 80 % error 5 % , sample size 73 patient arm would require ( Total 146 patient ) . 6 . Procedure TACE · Patient would admit day prior procedure · Patient would make fast overnight intravenous fluid infusion start maintain hydration · Pre-procedure analgesic ( 3rd generation antibiotic ) would start dose 2gm intravenously , 12 hourly , least 12 hour procedure continue 5 day post procedure · Under local anesthesia , Femoral artery would puncture upper thigh Medicut 18 gauge · A catheter would introduce route help guide wire flush aortogram , superior mesenteric arterioportography celiac artery run would undertake define size location tumor , feed vessel assess portal vein patency · Superselective catheterization hepatic artery feeding tumor would do · By place catheter tip beyond gastroduodenal artery , chemotherapeutic drug would administer . · Stable drug mixture would prepare use Doxorubicin 50mg , Cisplatin 100mg combination 10-15ml ionic contrast medium 10-20ml lipiodol continuously agitating mixture . · Hydrocortisone 100mg augment dose analgesic sedative would inject prior administration drug . · The drug mixture would inject indwell arterial catheter continuously flush alternately , repeatedly rapidly two lever lock syrinx connect across three way . · Gelfoam particle would inject follow embolization · Post procedure , devascularization would confirm additional angiography hepatic artery . · Procedure would last approx 45mts-1 hour . · Tight compression would give punctured site patient would shift ward complete hemostasis achieve . 7 . Follow post TACE Clinical follow - All patient would follow Liver clinic monthly unless clinical condition warrant earlier follow - Liver function tests/ complete blood count would also do visit AFP ( elevate earlier ) every six month - Patient tolerance , child 's status would estimate . Imaging follow - At one month , dual phase CT would do ascertain response therapy need repeat procedure . Subsequently , DPCT would do 3 6 monthly interval . - Once tumor show complete coverage , randomization two treatment group would do 9 . Repeat TACE follow This would do follow noted - DPCT show viable tumor - Fresh lesion appear - Elevated serum AFP occur without appearance viable mass DPCT 10 . Oral chemotherapy Drugs use would Thalidomide Capecitabine follow dosage schedule- Thalidomide -- -100mg day ( OD ) 7 day , Increased 200mg OD 7 day , increase 300mgOD 7 day till maximum 600mg day reach Capecitabine -- -- 500mg OD 7 day , 1000mg OD next 7 day , increase maximum dose 1500mg OD . Total leucocyte count &amp; Platelet count would monitor every 15 day 11 . Duration follow up- Two year achieve total coverage mass lesion DPCT 12 . Outcome measure Following parameter use ascertain outcome treatment 1 . Primary Outcome 1 . Survival rate- calculated start TACE 2 . End point Group 1 - Progression disease repeat TACE possible Group 2 - Death 2 . Secondary Outcome 1 . Tumor response dual phase CECT 2 . Patient tolerance 3 . Childs ' status cirrhosis- ascertain one two year follow depend upon Childs ' scoreScore &lt; 6- Childs ' A , 7-9 Childs ' B &gt; 10 Childs ' C</detailed_description>
