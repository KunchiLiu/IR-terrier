	<brief_title>Atorvastatin New Onset Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 1 diabetes autoimmune disease characterize destruction insulin-producing beta cell pancreas . T1DM therapy require insulin administration , either multiple daily injection insulin pump . However , many patient , blood sugar control remain suboptimal complication develop shorten life expectancy severely impact quality life . At time diagnosis , patient still significant residual beta cell function . Previous research show weaken immune system 's attack pancreatic beta cell may help preserve potentially increase insulin production . Preliminary study show member statin family medication , include atorvastatin ( Lipitor® ) , preserve beta cell function mouse model type 1 diabetes . These find suggest use atorvastatin combination insulin therapy may delay potentially reverse destruction beta cell patient recently develop type 1 diabetes . Atorvastatin ( Lipitor® ) approve use adult child ( &gt; 10 year age ) elevate blood cholesterol level . This study examine whether atorvastatin ( Lipitor® ) may also help body preserve insulin production patient newly diagnose ( within 8 week ) type 1 diabetes . Patients randomly assign take either atorvastatin ( Lipitor® ) placebo . Two every 3 patient receive atorvastatin 1 3 get placebo . As double-blinded study , neither care team patient know actually take atorvastatin ( Lipitor® ) . Patients give consent participate study pas require screening test take assign treatment every day 12 month . All patient begin take 10 mg daily , recommend start dose . After 4 week , dose increase 20 mg . In addition high standard diabetes care medication , patient blood test 7 visit 18 month period .</detailed_description>
