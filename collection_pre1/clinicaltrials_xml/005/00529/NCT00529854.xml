The outcome measure include number ICD-9 CPT cod discharge per patient , severity patient illness base documentation , STICU charge , number insurance company denial , DRG relative weight , well qualitative assessment attend physician use electronic billing module . The observational prospective patient population compare total patient-days STICU , ventilator-days , antibiotic-days , infectious complication per patient , injury severity score ( trauma patient ) ensure population similar documentation billing change account measure outcomes . We hypothesize SIC-IR billing module increase number patient ICD-9 CPT code discharge , increase severity STICU patient illness via accurate documentation , increase total STICU charge , decrease insurance company denial , efficient well accept electronic medical application .</brief_summary>
