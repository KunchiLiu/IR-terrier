	<brief_summary>The purpose trial compare acceptability , efficacy safety three alternative drug regimen use seasonal Intermittent Preventive Treatment prevent malaria child . Children age 2 month 5 year randomize receive IPT one three regimen transmission season : sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) plus amodiaquine , show highly effective IPT recent trial ; SP plus piperaquine , use malaria prophylaxis China many year ; Duocotexcin ( combination piperaquine artemisinin ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In area seasonal malaria transmission burden severe disease mortality due malaria mainly among child 5 year age . Intermittent preventive treatment ( IPT ) antimalarial drug give child month transmission season promise new strategy malaria prevention . Seasonal IPT sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) one dose artesunate result 90 % reduction incidence clinical malaria recent trial Senegal ( Cisse et al. , Lancet 2006 ) . An important consideration possible impact seasonal IPT emergence spread drug resistant parasite genotype , choice drug regimen therefore critical . A second trial Senegal show combination two non-artemisinin drug relatively long half life ( SP amodiaquine ( AQ ) three day ) effective SP artesunate effective AQ artesunate , prevent malaria ; child develop parasitaemia , potential drug resistant genotype emerge spread low . Although SP+AQ efficacious artemisinin-containing regimen test , associate high frequency adverse event , especially vomit , AQ bitter unpleasant taste , therefore concern acceptability AQ widespread use IPT . It important select drug regimen effective safe acceptable community . Each treatment 3-dose regimen 3 day , first dose supervised 2 dos give mother carer . One month treatment round , child visit home check malaria symptom , child fever history fever last 48 hour ask give finger prick blood sample malaria diagnosis . One month last treatment child ask give finger prick blood sample parasitology haemoglobin , axillary temperature measure . The child 's carer interview compliance adverse event . The endpoint cumulative incidence malaria , proportion child experience moderate severe adverse event , compliance acceptability regimen , prevalence parasitaemia , proportion child carry parasite genotype associate resistance sulfadoxine pyrimethamine end transmission season . Since acceptability difficult ass formal set trial , method delivery may affect compliance acceptability , drug treatment deliver community worker replicate condition IPT would deliver routinely Senegal . Treatments administer home local community worker , worker cover circuit approximately 60-80 child . The community worker circuit unit randomization , simplicity field minimise allocation error , avoid contamination due share tablet within household .</detailed_description>
