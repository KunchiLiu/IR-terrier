	<brief_title>Efficacy Atomoxetine Neuropsychological Tests Among Children With ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rationale proposal base upon high prevalence ( 7.5 % Taiwan ( Gau et al. , 2004b ) ) , magnitude short- long-term impact individual , family , society , responsibility attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD treatment CNS stimulant Atomoxetine . Although numerous study show methylphenidate demonstrates significant effect improve neuropsychological function include inhibition executive function ( e.g. , Aron et al. , 2003 ; Kempton et al. , 1999 ; Konrad et al. , 2004 ) motor control measure ( e.g. , Moll et al. , 2000 ) , study examine effect Atomoxetine improvement response inhibition neuropsychological functioning among child ADHD . As several clinical trial show efficacy Atomoxetine improve core symptom ADHD ( e.g. , Eiland Guest , 2004 ; Michelson et al. , 2002 ) Atomoxetine approve FDA first line medication child adult ADHD 2002 , anticipate Atomoxetine demonstrate significant efficacy treat ADHD improvement neuropsychological measure . The objective study : 1 . To examine efficacy atomoxetine executive functioning measure include Continuous Performance Test ( CPT ) executive function measure Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery ( CANTAB ) . 2 . To examine efficacy atomoxetine neuropsychological measure include Wisconsin Card Sorting Test ( WCST ) , attention , memory , pair learning test CANTAB . 3 . To validate ADHD use psychopathological , neuropsychological , functional brain imaging , behavioral , social correlate . This study open label , non randomize , clinical trial daily dose atomoxetine 1.2 mg/kg subject ADHD . Thirty drug-na√Øve child DSM-IV ADHD 30 normal child match sex , age , IQ recruit . All participant assess CPT , WSCT , CANTAB , several measure cover domain ADHD symptom social functioning . Subjects ADHD reassess use neuropsychological test measure Week 4 ( Visit 2 ) 3 day , Week 12 ( Visit 2 ) 3 day treatment atomoxetine 1.2 mg/kg . The sample consist 30 subject ADHD , age 10 15 , 30 subject without ADHD , match age , sex , IQ case . We anticipate study provide enough evidence support efficacy Atomoxetine symptom improvement also neuropsychological measure fMRI study among child ADHD .</detailed_description>
