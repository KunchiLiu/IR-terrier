	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Intervention Men Living With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In health care setting , psychosocial intervention target stress distress state integrate routine HIV care need serve large number patient . Due time- cost- efficiency , group approach use increasingly medical setting address need . One approach use successfully cancer chronic diseases mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) , 8-week manualized treatment program provide mood management technique base train mindfulness , metacognitive skill . A recent randomized control trial cancer demonstrate brief intervention significantly reduce anxiety depression symptom gain maintain six-month follow-up . Similar result obtain heterogeneous sample medical patient . Although research area infancy , appear MBSR may effective management anxiety mood symptom common across various medical condition thus may good treatment option men live HIV . Preliminary evidence , gather pilot assessment MBSR program HIV positive men , demonstrate significant pre- post-intervention reduction anxiety depression , well overall mood disturbance score standardize measure , thus , MBSR promise population . A randomized control trial clearly need however recommended psychosocial treatment men HIV . It predict MBSR effective mitigating anxiety depressive symptom , well HIV-related distress , among HIV patient ( Hypothesis # 1 ) . MBSR appear particularly well suit anxiety- depression- spectrum symptom target cognitive process contribute maintains . Current cognitive model emphasize central role worry rumination onset maintenance anxiety depression , respectively . Worry perpetuate upward spiral increase emotional arousal intrusive thought heighten anxiety symptom . Similarly , rumination escalate spiral cycle dysphoric affect associate negative think lead eventually major depressive episode . ( MBSR utilize train attention regulation think provide patient skill enable disengage pattern worry rumination otherwise would perpetuate negative affect . Consistent prediction , Dr. Bishop ( co-investigator ) find evidence recently complete pilot study mindfulness training result decrease frequency worry rumination . Although preliminary , MBSR may associate decrease worry rumination ( Hypothesis # 2 ) , consistent current cognitive model , decrease worry rumination would moderate reduction anxiety depression , respectively ( Hypothesis # 3 ) . We also interest whether approach effective management pain , prevalent population . There substantial evidence anxiety , particularly pain-related fear , heighten perception intensity unpleasantness pain anxiety management lessen pain . Since anticipate MBSR reduce anxiety study , would expect would also reduce subjective experience pain ( Hypothesis # 4 ) . There evidence uncontrolled trial suggest MBSR may highly effective manage chronic pain . If MBSR use effectively mitigate pain , would recursive effect mood . Pain medical population significant factor emotional distress psychiatric morbidity .</detailed_description>
