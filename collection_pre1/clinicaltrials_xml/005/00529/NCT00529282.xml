	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety efficacy ceftobiprole versus comparator patient fever neutropenia</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Ceftobiprole Patients With Fever Neutropenia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study discontinue due issue regard comparator , cefepime . In Nov 2007 FDA issue MedWatch regard cefepime trial suspend . As May 14 , 2008 FDA still evaluate data cefepime final follow pending . There safety issue ceftobiprole study base enrollment 2 subject September 2007 . The study discontinue administrative reason . Ceftobiprole medocaril cephalosporin antibiotic anti-MRSA ( Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ) activity . Ceftobiprole yet approve , undergo regulatory review treatment skin infection . This randomized ( patient assign receive different treatment study base chance ) , double-blind ( neither patient physician know whether drug investigate comparator agent take ) , multicenter study treatment ceftobiprole medocaril versus treatment comparator patient 18 year age old , fever neutropenia chemotherapy cancer require intravenous therapy . Patients randomly assign receive either ceftobiprole medocaril comparator . In addition , patient comparator group risk serious infection due gram-positive pathogen ( disease-causing bacteria ) may also receive antibiotic MRSA activity . The study consist follow 3 phase : prerandomization phase ( include screen baseline assessment ) ; treatment phase , follow-up phase consist primary efficacy visit late follow-up visit . The primary endpoint clinical cure rate . The total duration study determine time resolution fever neutropenia condition associate episode fever neutropenia . This follow primary efficacy visit ( 7 10 day end therapy ) late follow-up visit ( 28 35 day end treatment ) . Cultures ( sample blood suspect site infection ) collect study well blood sample hematology chemistry ( safety assessment ) . All adverse event also report throughout study 4 5 week last dose study drug . Patients randomize either ceftobiprole comparator approximately 7 14 day .</detailed_description>
