	<brief_summary>This Phase I study direct evaluate safety profile ( primary end-point ) immunogenicity ( secondary end-point ) recombinant HIV-1 Tat vaccine healthy , immunologically competent adult subject without identifiable risk HIV-1 infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Safety Immunogenicity Preventative Vaccine Trial Based Recombinant Tat Protein</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development vaccine HIV/AIDS primary focus structural protein ( Env , Gag ) HIV-1 aim induce sterilize immunity block virus entry . Alternative approach focus new vaccine strategy aim modify virus-host dynamic favouring establishment long-term non-progressing disease status . Such strategy target regulatory protein first express infection essential viral replication , infectivity pathogenesis . Thus , approach may effective preventive therapeutic vaccination strategy . Being early viral regulatory protein necessary viral gene expression , cell-to-cell virus transmission disease progression , Tat represent key target protein host immune response optimal candidate vaccination strategy . Preclinical study demonstrate vaccination biologically active Tat protein safe , elicits broad specific immune response induces long-term protection infection . Cross-sectional longitudinal study natural infection suggest presence anti-Tat humoral immune response correlate asymptomatic infection slow disease progression presence CD8+ T cell response Tat correlate early virus control humans monkey . Since immunogenic region Tat well conserve among HIV-1 M group , vaccine base Tat may use different geographic area world . The subject stratify two Arms accord administration route receive 5 intradermal subcutaneous immunization 4 week interval .</detailed_description>
