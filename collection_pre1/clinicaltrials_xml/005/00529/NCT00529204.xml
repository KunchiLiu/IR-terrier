	<brief_summary>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) common complication type 2 diabetes lead cause liver disease US Europe . The prevalence NAFLD NASH expect become major cause liver disease related death liver transplantation . Currently , specific therapy alter natural history NAFLD.Preliminary evidence suggest exenatide ( Byetta® ) may several beneficial direct indirect effect NAFLD liver lipid metabolism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Of Exenatide On Liver Biochemistry , Liver Histology And Lipid Metabolism In Patients With Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preliminary evidence suggest exenatide ( Byetta® ) may several beneficial direct indirect effect NAFLD liver lipid metabolism . Ad hoc analysis phase III study show exenatide treatment associate improvement normalization alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , marker liver injury , effect pronounce great weight loss . In addition , treatment leptin deficient ob/ob mouse exenatide reduce weight , liver lipid content , serum ALT liver lipid peroxidation . Additional evidence suggest effect exenatide liver simply result weight loss , rather due direct effect liver . Hepatocytes express GLP-1 receptor responsive GLP-1 exenatide . Furthermore , exenatide treatment ob/ob mice isolated hepatocytes reduces mRNA stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 ( SCD-1 ) SREBP-1c , would expect reduce DNL . Based upon data , hypothesize exenatide treatment diabetic patient NAFLD NASH reduce liver injury multiple mechanisms include weight reduction associate exenatide , improve lipid metabolism decrease expression hepatic gene involve DNL reduction adipokines cytokine associate severe NASH . This study aim address potential safety efficacy exenatide treatment NAFLD test hypothesis . This open label , single-arm , non-comparative trial 20 patient type 2 diabetes NAFLD treat exenatide 6 month follow specific aim assess : Determine safety efficacy 24 week exenatide treatment diabetic patient Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD ) Efficacy measure change serum ALT ( primary endpoint ) liver histology . Characterize effect exenatide serum level adipokines inflammatory cytokine include adiponectin , leptin TNF- NAFLD patient . Compare hepatic expression SCD1 , SREBP-1c PPAR- mRNA NAFLD patient pre- post-treatment exenatide . Establish effect exenatide post-prandial lipid metabolism . Determine effect exenatide liver fibrosis NAFLD .</detailed_description>
