	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find give azacitidine valproic acid plus carboplatin help control advance cancer . The safety treatment study well . Researchers also collect extra blood sample molecular marker study ( study may help researcher predict participant respond combine therapy ) . There two phase study : Phase 1 portion find acceptable dos study drug combination , Phase 2 portion study response rate treatment schedule . The study proceed Phase 2 portion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine Valproic Acid Plus Carboplatin Patients With Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Researchers want see combination azacitidine , carboplatin , valproic may work good together control advance cancer . - Azacitidine design activate ( `` turn '' ) certain gene cancer cell whose job fight tumor , may also make azacitidine work well anti-tumor drug . - Carboplatin design block growth cancer cell stop cell division , may cause cell die . - Valproic acid anti-seizure medication may also cancer-fighting ability . This drug may able activate tumor-fighting gene , cause cancer cell die . Phase 1 ( Dose Escalation ) Phase 2 ( Treatment ) : Participants enrol Phase 1 study group 3 . Each group receive different combination study drug . If first group 3 tolerates study drug combination well , next group 3 enrol , dose ( ) carboplatin and/or valproic acid high last group . Each new group get high dose carboplatin and/or valproic acid . If 1 3 participant serious side effect certain dose level , 3 participant may add dose level check safety combination . If participant dose level serious side effect , next dose level test . However , second participant serious side effect , dose level one consider `` maximum tolerate dose '' ( MTD ) . Once MTD find , participant enrol Phase 2 study . Participants enrol Phase 2 give MTD level study drug combination ; however , study progress Phase 2 . Participants phase treatment schedule study test perform . The difference Phase 1 Phase 2 dose level study drug combination give . Study Treatment : If eligible , participant receive study treatment 28-day treatment cycle . On Day 1 cycle , receive injection azacitidine skin vein 30 minute day 5 day row . On Day 3 Day 10 cycle , receive carboplatin vein 60 minute . On Days 5-11 cycle , take valproic acid mouth day without food . On Day 12 cycle , may receive injection NeulastaTM ( pegfilgrastim ) skin , depend whether study doctor think need help boost white blood cell count . On Days 13-28 cycle , `` rest period '' study drug begin new 28-day cycle treatment . Study Visits : At certain time point , follow tests/procedure perform study visit : On Day 5 Day 11 Cycles 1-3 , 1 tablespoon blood drawn treatment molecular marker study . These test perform look link genetic characteristic response study drug treatment . Within last 72 hour ( 3 day ) cycle , blood drawn ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . After start cycle , blood drawn ( 1 tablespoon ) weekly routine test . Within 7 day start new cycle , evaluation see may experience side effect . After end every 2 cycle ( every 8 week ) , x-ray either CT scan MRI scan re-evaluate cancer . Length Study : Participants continue receive treatment study , long disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . End-of-Treatment Visit : Once treatment end reason , participant come back end-of-treatment visit follow tests/procedures perform : - You complete physical exam . - You urine collect blood drawn ( 1 tablespoon ) routine test . - You may CT scan MRI scan remeasure re-evaluate cancer . Up 65 patient eligible take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson . Study halt Phase 1 without progress second phase .</detailed_description>
