	<brief_summary>The objective study examine functional effect methacholine challenge small airway use three different nebulizer generate particle HMAD suitable distribution small , intermediate large airways.Pulmonary function assess use plethysmography impulse oscillation technique . Eight asthmatic subject ( &gt; 18 year , sex ) stable clinically require intermittent ß2-agonist treatment recruit undergo methacholine challenge vivo , dose-finding observational study . Three separate methacholine challenge carry use three different nebulizer . After challenge , pulmonary function test perform subject assess functional change large small airway . Results test compare three nebulizer . These experiment demonstrate whether functional change occur small airway response methacholine , measure pulmonary function test selectively target small airway use nebulizer generates small particle . The result experiment give u well understanding role small airways methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction asthmatic , compare sensitivity plethysmography compare forced oscillation detect change small airway .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Of Methacholine Challenge Administered Using Three Different Nebulizers On Small Airways Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study measure change small airway plethysmography impulse oscillation follow delivery methacholine use nebulizer design deliver small ( Wright ) , intermediate ( PARI LC® Plus ) large ( PARI SinuStar™ ) airways . Assessment small airway involvement plethysmography include Residual Volume ( RV ) , Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) Peak Inspiratory Expiratory Flow rate ( PIF PEF , respectively ) . Impulse oscillation include measure large small airway resistance . Baseline Spirometry Baseline FEV1 VC register use water spirometer . Methacholine Challenge ( Screening ) Methacholine inhalation perform describe Cockcroft ( 1996 ) . Subjects instruct wear noseclips breathe normally mouthpiece 2-minute inhalation period . Subjects inhale normal saline , double concentration methacholine Wright nebulizer 2 minute . FEV1 measure 30 , 90 , 180 300 second inhalation . Spirometry measure Collins water seal spirometer kymograph . The test terminate fall FEV1 20 % baseline value occur , methacholine PC20 calculate . Methacholine Challenge During second visit , subject randomize inhale nebulizer generates particle HMAD suitable distribution either small , intermediate large airway . Subjects inhale double concentration methacholine 2 minute . Immediately inhalation , pulmonary function test perform subject via plethysmography . Measurements make interval 30 second , 60 second , 3 minute 5 minute ( fall FEV1 20 % baseline reach ) . The methacholine test terminate fall FEV1 20 % baseline value reach . After recovery time 1 hour , dose re-administered pulmonary function test perform , time via impulse oscillation . The procedure repeat third fourth visit remain nebulizer ( select randomly ) . The nebulizer use target certain airway Wright nebulizer ( small ) , PARI LC® Plus nebulizer ( medium ) PARI SinuStar™ nebulizer ( large ) . Plethysmography Pulmonary function test perform subject methacholine challenge via plethysmography . Various test perform allow different lung function measure . To characterize measurement indicative large small airway function , measurement three nebulizer group compare . Potential measure small airway function include Functional Residual Capacity ( FRC ) , Residual Volume ( RV ) , Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) Peak Inspiratory Expiratory Flow Rates ( PIF PEF , respectively ) ( Knudson et al. , 1980 ) . Nitrogen washout also perform body box measure airway distensibility , relationship airway caliber lung volume ( Brown et al. , 2004 ) . Impulse Oscillation Pulmonary function test perform subject methacholine challenge via impulse oscillation . This device use loudspeaker generate pressure flow generate various frequency , specifically differentiate large small airway obstruction ( Otis et al. , 1956 ) . Results compare three nebulizer group specifically target certain airway .</detailed_description>
