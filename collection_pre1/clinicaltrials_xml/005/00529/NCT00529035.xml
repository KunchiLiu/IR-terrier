	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine safety IL-2 high dose drug give safely people chronic graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . Chronic GVHD medical condition may occur patient receive bone marrow , stem cell cord blood transplant . The donor 's immune system may recognize body ( host ) foreign attempt `` reject '' . Traditional standard therapy treat chronic GVHD prednisone ( steroid ) . Treatment option limit , think IL-2 may help control chronic GVHD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- IL-2 give daily injection skin period 8 week . To determine high safe dose IL-2 , dose participant receive increase lower dos determine safe . There three dose level . - Participants see periodically receive IL-2 . Physical exams blood test perform weekly first two week every week week 8 .</detailed_description>
