	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study With CEA ( 6D ) VRP Vaccine Patients With Advanced Metastatic CEA-Expressing Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CEA represent attractive target antigen immunotherapy since express nearly colorectal cancer pancreatic cancer , also express lung breast cancer , uncommon tumor medullary thyroid cancer , express cell body except low-level expression gastrointestinal epithelium [ 1 ] . That CEA potential target T cell mediate immune response human demonstrate observation CEA contain epitope may recognize MHC restricted fashion T cell [ 2-11 ] . Specifically , support existence human cytolytic T cell ( CTLs ) recognize CEA epitope bind MHC molecule HLA- A2 , A3 , A24 . For part , T cell generate vitro culture use antigen-presenting cell pulse epitope interest stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cell . In addition , T cell line generate stimulation CEA latex bead , CEA protein-pulsed plastic adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cell , DCs sensitize CEA RNA . T cell also generate patient immunized vaccinia vector encode CEA immunogen ( discuss ) . Using high-performance liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry-based approach , HLA A2-presented peptide CEA identify primary gastrointestinal tumor [ 12 ] . Of HLA A2 restrict epitope CEA , CAP-1 , nine amino acid sequence , show stimulate CTLs cancer patient immunize vaccinia-CEA . Cap-1 ( 6D ) peptide analog CAP-1 . Its sequence include heteroclitic ( nonanchor position ) mutation , result amino acid change Asn Asp , enhance recognition T-cell receptor without change bind HLA A2 . Compared non mutate CAP-1 epitope , Cap-1 ( 6D ) show enhance sensitization CTLs 100 1,000 time [ 3 , 5 , 13 ] . CTL line could elicit peripheral blood mononuclear cell healthy volunteer vitro sensitization Cap-1 ( 6D ) peptide CAP-1 peptide . These cell line lyse human tumor cell express endogenous CEA .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Cohorts 14 : Histologically confirm diagnosis metastatic malignancy due tumor express CEA . The tumor must express CEA define immunohistochemical staining , CEA blood level , tumor know universally CEA positive . Must receive treatment standard therapy possible overall survival benefit refuse therapy . Must receive progress least one line palliative chemotherapy colorectal , breast , lung , pancreatic cancer . For malignancy , first line therapy survival palliative benefit exists , administer progressive disease . Cohort 5 Only : Histologically confirm colon cancer ( rectal cancer exclude ) . Since colon cancer nearly universally CEA positive , CEA staining require . Documented stage III colon cancer evidence disease . One six month follow standard postoperative adjuvant treatment , consist 5fluorouracil folinic acid capecitabine without oxaliplatin 46 month ) All Cohorts : Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 % . Estimated life expectancy &gt; 6 month expect require systemic chemotherapy least 3 month . Age ≥ 18 year . Adequate hematologic function ( WBC ≥ 3000/microliter , hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL , platelet ≥ 100,000/microliter ) . Adequate renal hepatic function , ( serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL , bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL , ALT AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ) . Patients receive CEAtargeted immunotherapy , treatment discontinue least 3 month enrollment . Patients take medication know history immunosuppression eligible trial . Ability understand provide sign informed consent . Ability return Duke University Medical Center adequate followup , require protocol . Concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy radiation therapy ( must least 3 month prior CEAtargeted immunotherapy study treatment least 4 week prior therapy study treatment ) . Patients previously resect brain metastasis permit CT MRI scan show metastasis within 1 month enrollment . History autoimmune disease .</criteria>
