	<brief_summary>This study evaluate clinical efficacy 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) apply supplementary motor area ( SMA ) Tourette 's Syndrome ( TS ) patient fully respond conventional therapy . The investigator collect TMS measure motor cortex excitability test whether rTMS restores normal level intracortical inhibition find deficient TS . The investigator administer neuropsychological test demonstrate SMA target rTMS administer safely without significant impairment cognitive motor functioning . The investigator hypothesize : 1 . Compared sham ( placebo ) , active rTMS improve symptom TS assess Yale Global Tic Severity Scale ( Y-GTSS ) Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) . 2 . Active ( sham ) rTMS normalize level motor cortex excitability , reflect increased intracortical inhibition , motor threshold , cortical silent period , decrease intracortical facilitation , relative pre-treatment baseline .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study test efficacy repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) treatment Tourette 's Syndrome ( TS ) . It also examine measure brain function study brain basis underlie TS . Despite major advance study treatment TS , patient often experience full remission pharmacotherapy behavioral therapy ( Leckman 2002 ) . rTMS non-invasive procedure stimulate brain use magnetic field . This pilot study report rTMS may reduce TS symptom ( Mantovani et al. , 2006 ) . While promising , prior research several limitation ( e.g. , relatively small sample size , lack sham [ placebo ] comparison ) . This study address drawback prior work , provide data help determine whether rTMS useful TS patient resistant conventional therapy . 25 outpatient TS partially responsive conventional therapy randomly assign either active low frequency ( 1 Hz ) rTMS sham ( placebo ) stimulation . The active sham stimulation apply supplementary motor area ( SMA ) daily three week . If rTMS add onto ongoing pharmacotherapy , dose must stable four week prior study entry . The SMA select connection brain area implicate TS . Pilot work indicate stimulation SMA low frequency rTMS beneficial TS patient . Low frequency rTMS add benefit well safety profile ( i.e . risk seizure ) high frequency rTMS . Rating scale symptom change obtain baseline , rTMS course , end three week treatment . Patients offer open-label cross-over phase additional three week daily active rTMS treatment . Patients meet remission criterion either phase response criterion follow cross-over phase continue routine clinical care supervision treat psychiatrist invite back assessment 1 , 3 , 6 month determine persistence benefit . Excitability motor cortex report abnormal TS , may relate dysfunction motor pathway . We collect measure motor cortex excitability ( single paired-pulse TMS ) baseline phase study whether change measure may correlate clinical improvement .</detailed_description>
