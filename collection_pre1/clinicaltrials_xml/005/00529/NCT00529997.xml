	<brief_summary>The purpose trial ass whether Stabilimax NZ® least safe effective control therapy fusion patient receive decompression surgery treatment clinically symptomatic spinal stenosis one contiguous vertebral level L1-S1 . Safety effectiveness assess mean primary study endpoint address improvement pain function absence major device relate complication . The study hypothesis criterion demonstrate safety efficacy require scientific evidence patient classify satisfy primary study endpoint post device implantation least good Stabilimax NZ® recipients patient undergo fusion posterior pedicle screw instrumentation 24 month followup assessment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dynamic Stabilization Lumbar Spinal Stenosis With Stabilimax NZ® Dynamic Spine Stabilization System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Degenerative spine disease normal part age process . This degeneration sometimes cause significant pain limit normal movement . The pain many source . For patient enrol study pain diagnose primarily result condition call spinal stenosis . The current standard care treatment moderate severe spinal stenosis surgical procedure relieve pressure spinal cord nerve call decompression surgery . The surgeon remove tissue bone cause narrow thus relieve pinch spinal cord nerve root . After surgery , patient may spine unstable . In word muscle ligament around spine work hard maintain normal posture control movement . For many year patient unstable back receive fusion therapy . Fusion development bone vertebra stabilize spine prevent motion . This do insert bone graft around vertebra treat place rigid brace call fusion device prevent movement . Eventually bone form vertebra spine become `` fused '' . In study conduct research evaluate new , investigative medical device design brace support spine like fusion without fuse patient 's spine . Devices call `` motion preserving '' `` dynamic stabilizing '' spinal device . The investigational device evaluate study call Stabilimax NZ® Dynamic Spinal Stabilization System . The Stabilimax NZ® insert fix vertebra mean pedicle screw exactly way fusion device insert attach . The difference Stabilimax NZ® bone graft place around vertebra promote bone growth fusion . Patients study receive either Stabilimax NZ® receive fusion procedure . The study randomize controlled clinical trial use 2:1 investigational : control randomization scheme . The study enroll 480 patient approximately 20 investigational site across United States .</detailed_description>
