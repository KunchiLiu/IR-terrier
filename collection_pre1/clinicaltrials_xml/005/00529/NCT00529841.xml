	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop physiological approach management child adolescent salt waste Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia . We administer glucocorticosteroid via insulin infusion pump see whether treatment improve serum hormone concentration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Research Study Children With Salt Wasting Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The adrenal gland small organ body . It produce important chemical call hormone . One hormone , cortisol ( stress hormone ) help body fight disease . The hormone aldosterone help maintain normal amount salt water body . The third type hormone androgens male hormone , cause change puberty , like growth body hair pimple . The salt waste Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia CAH disease disease adrenal gland . Patients disease make cortisol aldosterone . As result , body fight diseases keep normal amount salt water body . At time , gland make much male hormone , bad body much male hormone slow growth , increase growth body hair , cause pimple abnormal period girl . Patients disease take medication every day . However , treatment work well , usually patient right amount hormone body . Usually body get much hormone right take pill . A couple hour later body little hormone , meantime body get rid medication.The healthy adrenal gland make hormone throughout day different amount . The patient disease take medication couple time day . They take Florinef tablet day Cortisol tablet two three time day . The treatment use today mouth copy natural hormone production adrenal gland . Because make much difference patient 's life . We would like improve treatment find effect new treatment . In study try imitate body 's normal hormone production give medication via insulin pump see treatment method decrease male hormone blood . This study help u develop new well treatment child adolescent .</detailed_description>
