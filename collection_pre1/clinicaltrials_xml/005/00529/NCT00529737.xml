	<brief_title>Effect Clip Markers After Vacuum-Assisted Biopsy Postprocedure Mammogram</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>You schedule biopsy lesion see mammogram . Sometimes , lesion completely remove biopsy . Therefore , clip usually place mark biopsy site . If tissue area need remove surgeon later date , clip mark area surgeon remove . All participant study already schedule stereotactic biopsy clip placement follow mammogram , part standard care . You need sign separate consent document procedure . Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . Women able child must negative blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test take part study . If eligible choose take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two study group . There equal chance assign either group . If assign Group 1 , breast compress way breast compress biopsy first mammogram picture . In second picture , breast compress opposite way ( 90-degree rotation ) way first picture do . If assign Group 2 , breast compress 90-degree rotation way breast compress biopsy first mammogram picture . In second picture , breast compress way biopsy . A researcher review mammogram measure record distance biopsy clip biopsied lesion . If biopsy benign ( non-cancerous ) , return clinic mammogram year , standard care . Researchers would like review mammogram take 1 year biopsy order check see clip move stayed place . This investigational study . The clip use study FDA approve . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol M.D . Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patient present M. D. Anderson stereotactic guide 9 gauge vacuumassisted breast biopsy undergo stereotactic biopsy biopsy clip deployment would consider study . If patient refuse biopsy biopsy cancel eligible . No biopsy clip see immediate postprocedure mammogram additional clip deploy . Pregnant woman exclude study . Patients previous biopsy surgery ( ipsilateral ) breast exclude study .</criteria>
