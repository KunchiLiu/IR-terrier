	<brief_summary>Individuals deficiency alpha-1 antitrypsin ( AAT ) often develop emphysema . Traditional lung function test may accurate way measure progression emphysema . This study compare high resolution compute tomography ( CT ) scan spirometry measure progression emphysema .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use High Resolution Chest Computed Tomography Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AAT deficiency genetic disorder associate emphysema . Spirometry , lung function test measure well lung exhale air , use diagnose track progression emphysema . Some study suggest forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) measurement , type spirometry test , may lack accuracy detect disease progression case severe AAT deficiency . Another method , high resolution chest CT scan , may accurate measure progression emphysema . The purpose study determine high resolution CT scan well detect progression emphysema lung function test . Results study may lead development accurate way ass lung tissue loss may improve understand lung destruction AAT deficiency . This study last 4 year enroll people AAT deficiency nearly normal lung function test result . Study visit , last 4 hour , occur baseline month 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 . At visit , participant undergo lung function test , CT scan , blood collection , physical exam . Female participant urine collected pregnancy test . All participant also complete questionnaire assess health status lung function . Study researcher call participant every 2 month collect information lung disease symptoms medication change .</detailed_description>
