	<brief_title>Phase II Study Irinotecan/Capecitabine Patients With Antracycline/Taxane Pretreated MBC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This nonrandomized , open-label , phase II study irinotecan plus capecitabine patient metastatic breast cancer previously treat anthracyclines taxanes . Up 44 qualified patient enrol accord exact single stage design . Irinotecan 90 mg/m2 intravenously 90 minute week 2 week ( Days 1 8 ) follow 1-week rest period . Capecitabine administer orally dose 1,000 mg/m2 twice daily ( total daily dose 2,000 mg/m2 ) intermittent regimen 3-week cycle ( 2 week treatment follow 1-week rest period ) . For practical reason , capecitabine dos round near dose could administer combination 500-mg 150-mg tablet drug . Capecitabine give approximately 12 hour apart take orally water within 30 minute ingestion food ( breakfast dinner ) .</detailed_description>
