	<brief_title>Goserelin/Letrozole Premenopausal Patients vs Letrozole Alone Postmenopausal Patients With MBC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The site estrogen synthesis ovary premenopausal woman extragonadal site fat , muscle , skin , normal breast stromal cell breast tumor tissue . After ovarian failure , estrogen synthesize peripheral tissue fat muscle peripheral aromatization postmenopausal woman almost completely inhibited single-agent administration third generation inhibitor ( anastrozole , letrozole exemestane etc ) . In contrast , barrier use aromatase inhibitor monotherapy premenopausal woman . First , high level androstenedione compete initially inhibitor substrate enzyme complex . Second , suppression estrogen result reflex increase gonadotrophin level , provoke ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome , cause steep increase aromatase ovary turn overcomes blockade inhibitor . The rationale combination therapy regimen gonadotropins-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist goserelin plus aromatase inhibitor premenopausal patient , effectively render patient postmenopausal use goserelin , peripheral E2 production inhibit aromatase inhibitor . Goserelin alone show produce castrate level estradiol ( E2 ) response rate similar oophorectomy premenopausal woman . Selective aromatase inhibitor include letrozole become standard second-line endocrine therapy , failure tamoxifen postmenopausal woman advance breast cancer . Aromatase inhibitor challenge first-line endocrine therapy hormone-sensitive breast cancer . Ovarian expression aromatase regulate gonadotropin , LH FSH . Theoretically , combination GnRH analogue aromatase inhibitor induce complete estrogen blockade premenopausal breast cancer patient . Although combination goserelin tamoxifen establish therapeutic option premenopausal patient breast cancer , result early study compare tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor first line therapy postmenopausal patient advance breast cancer , hypothesize letrozole may accomplish good clinical result tamoxifen first line hormonal therapy patient metastatic breast cancer become menopause GnRH agonist first line hormonal therapy . Developing combination therapy would particularly useful since 50 % breast cancer develop less 50 year old woman Korea . Therefore , go evaluate clinical endocrine result first-line goserelin plus letrozole premenopausal patient metastatic breast cancer first-line letrozole alone postmenopausal patient . Recently , CYP19 single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) tumor tissue show associated efficacy aromatase inhibitor . In study , 67 postmenopausal patient hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer treat letrozole , median TTP significantly longer patient rs4646 variant intratumoral CYP19 , SNP 3'-UTR , compare normal CYP19 ( 17.2 month versus 6.4 month ; P=0.02 ) . This result suggest importance local aromatase activity tumor specific genetic alteration efficacy aromatase inhibitor . Up recently , tumor-specific genetic marker assess primarily tumor biopsy . However , advanced stage patient , tumor tissue often unavailable , since surgery always perform case even biopsy sample obtain , limit use tumor tissue genetic assessment . The detection tumor specific genetic alteration cancer patient distant site tumor , blood , would provide useful predictor efficacy treatment . Some tumor genetic alteration observe extracellular circulate DNA blood sample breast cancer patient , include alteration microsatellites , LOH , TP53 gene mutation .</detailed_description>
