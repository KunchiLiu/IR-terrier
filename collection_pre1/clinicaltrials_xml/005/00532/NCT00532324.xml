	<detailed_description>Background : Community acquire methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( CA-MRSA ) emerge pathogen 21st century whose incidence cause local invasive infection significantly increase , especially previously healthy term near term neonate may associate high morbidity mortality ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) . The etiology increase remain unclear , may consequence perinatal postnatal acquisition via maternal transmission skin , breast milk , vaginal colonization ( 4 ) . The major goal study : determine incidence pregnant woman colonize CA-MRSA , gain well understanding transmission dynamic organism mother newborn infant , develop strategy prevention transmission , spread infection organism population . This stag study collaborative effort investigator Children 's Memorial Hospital Division Infectious Diseases , Northwestern Memorial Hospital Department Obstetrics Gynecology , Northwestern Memorial Hospital Division Infectious Diseases . Collaboration across multiple specialty provide strength study allow investigator address multiple issue pertinent care pregnant mother newborn infant inpatient outpatient setting . Hypothesis : 1 . The incidence previously healthy term near-term neonate infect CA-MRSA skin &amp; soft tissue ( SSTI ) invasive infection higher born mother vaginally and/or nasally colonize CA-MRSA , 2 . Pregnant woman vaginally and/or nasally colonize CA-MRSA high risk post-partum infection organism . Specific Aims : 1 . To determine incidence nasal vaginal colonization CA-MRSA pregnant woman determine clonality strain . 2 . To study CA-MRSA transmission dynamic evaluate incidence SSTI invasive infection term near-term newborn bear S. aureus vaginal and/or nasal colonize mother . 3 . To study efficacy attempted decolonization CA-MRSA colonize mother decrease incidence transmission development SSTI invasive infection infant first month life . Methods : 1 . Vaginal anterior nasal culture obtain prospectively several month pregnant woman obtain prenatal care Obstetrical practice Prentice Women 's Hospital Maternity Center Northwestern Memorial Hospital time GBS screen 34-36 week gestation . Together , practice account 300-500 delivery per month . 2 . Cultures plat blood agar incubate 37oC 48 hour . S. aureus strain identify colony morphology latex agglutination . MRSA isolate identify PCR latex agglutination penicillin bind protein 2a detect mecA gene clonality PFGE . PCR test use identify strain carry Panton-Valentine Leukocidin gene marker virulence . 3 . In prospective case-control cohort study , newborns bear CA-MRSA colonized mother anterior naris culture S. aureus obtain birth follow development SSTI invasive infection one month . Samples positive MRSA test similarity maternal isolates method describe . The newborn incidence MRSA infection compare born non-colonized mother bear colonized mother . 4 . In stage study , woman find nasally and/or vaginally colonize CA-MRSA randomized receive postpartum , either : 1 ) attempt decolonization intranasal mupirocin without diluted chlorhexidine Clorox bath , 2 ) intervention . Potential Impact : Understanding epidemiology transmission dynamic CA-MRSA previously healthy neonate provide important information support development strategy aim interruption transmission prevention infection cause CA-MRSA patient population , well pregnant woman . This also allow development infection control strategy hospital set prevent spread organism among post-partum unit nursery .</detailed_description>
