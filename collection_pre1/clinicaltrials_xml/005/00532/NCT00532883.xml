	<brief_title>Hydroxyurea Magnesium Pidolate Treat People With Hemoglobin Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCD inherit blood disorder . Symptoms include anemia , infection , organ damage , intense episode pain , call `` sickle cell crisis . '' SCD cause abnormal type hemoglobin , protein inside red blood cell carry oxygen . HbSC form SCD characterize presence dense red blood cell . People HbSC usually develop less severe SCD symptom people common form disease . There limited treatment approach aim specifically modify abnormal state red blood cell . Also , combination therapy treatment study . The medication hydroxyurea currently use prevent sickle cell crises decrease need blood transfusion . The dietary supplement magnesium widely study treatment SCD , may prevent dehydration , may decrease frequency sickle cell crisis . The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness hydroxyurea magnesium pidolate , alone combine , reduce red blood cell density frequency sickle cell crises people HbSC . This 1-year study enroll people HbSC . Participants randomly assign one follow four treatment group : - Group 1 participant receive placebo pill placebo liquid . - Group 2 participant receive hydroxyurea pill placebo liquid . - Group 3 participant receive placebo pill magnesium pidolate liquid . - Group 4 participant receive hydroxyurea pill magnesium pidolate liquid . Participants receive hydroxyurea placebo pill day magnesium pidolate placebo liquid twice day 11 month . Study visit occur every 2 week first 2 month study , month follow 9 month , Year 1 . At visit , physical exam blood collection occur . Selected visit also include urine collection pregnancy test female participant . Throughout study , participant record study medication use daily diary .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis HbSC disease Hemoglobin level 8 12.5 g/dL At least one vasoocclusive event ( e.g. , pain , acute chest syndrome ) 12 month prior study entry . An episode pain define occurrence pain extremity , back , abdomen , chest , head last least 2 hour ; require visit hospital , emergency room , clinic , provider 's office ; explain except SCD . Acute chest syndrome define new pulmonary infiltrate chest xray associate fever ( great 38.5Â° C ) , tachypnea , wheeze , cough , chest pain . Regular compliance comprehensive care In steady disease state experience acute complication SCD ( i.e. , hospitalization , pain event , episode acute chest syndrome within 1 month prior study entry ) Previous transfusion remain hemoglobin A great 10 % Previous treatment hydroxyurea within last 3 month Previous treatment magnesium within 3 month prior study entry ( include vitamin contain magnesium ) Poor compliance previous treatment regimen Liver dysfunction ( SGPT great twice upper limit normal ) within 1 month prior study entry Kidney dysfunction ( creatinine great equal 1.0 mg/dL participant less 18 year age ; great equal 1.2 mg/dL participant 18 year age old ) within 1 month prior study entry Pregnant Ten hospital admission pain 12 month prior study entry Daily use narcotic Treatment investigational drug 3 month prior study entry Less 3 % red blood cell density great 41 g/dL ( measure ADVIA 120 system ) Positive HIV test Other longterm illness disorder SCD could adversely affect performance study ( e.g. , tuberculosis )</criteria>
