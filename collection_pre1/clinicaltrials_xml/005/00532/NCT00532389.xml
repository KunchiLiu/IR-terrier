	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : 1 . Patients must diagnosis active multiple myeloma accord International Myeloma Working Group criterion ( IMWG. , 2003 ) , deem investigator require treatment . 2 . Patients must receive least one prior line therapy include patient whose disease relapse well relapsedrefractory MM . ( Durie et . al. , 2006 ) . One prior line therapy may consist induction follow autologous stem cell transplantation . 3 . Patients must suitable ( accord local product information applicable health authority recommendation ) treatment BTZ . Note : patient previously treat BTZ eligible participate trial . 4 . Patients enrol dose expansion phase must measurable M component entry accord IMWG Criteria ( Durie et al , 2006 ) include least one following : Serum Mprotein sPEP ≥ 1 g/dL ( &gt; 10g/l ) For patient IgA Mprotein whose sPEP provide sufficiently precise quantification due confound migration Mprotein serum beta globulin , quantification nephelometry / turbidometry permit must show serum Mprotein ≥ 1 g/dL Urine Mprotein uPEP ≥ 200 mg/24 h Serum FLC assay : Involved FLC level ≥ 100 mg/L , provide serum FLC ratio abnormal . ( abnormal FLC ratio &lt; 0.26 &gt; 1.65 ) 5 . Adults ≥ 18 year old 6 . ECOG Performance Status ≤ 2 7 . Life expectancy &gt; 12 week 8 . Patients must follow laboratory value : ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelets ≥ 100x 109/L Calculated CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min ( MDRD Formula ) AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Serum potassium , magnesium , phosphorous , within normal limit ( WNL ) institution Total calcium ( correct serum albumin ) ionize calcium equal low normal limit institution great ( ≥ LLN ) high CTCAE grade 1 Note : Potassium , calcium , magnesium , and/or phosphorous supplement may give correct value &lt; LLN . 9 . Baseline MUGA ECHO must demonstrate LVEF ≥ low limit institutional normal 10 . All patient ( doseescalation doseexpansion patient ) must willing undergo mandatory bone marrow aspirate sample baseline ( cytology ) another later study patient eventually go experience CR PR . For patient join study doseexpansion phase , must also give consent extra volume sample take exploratory biomarker test . Potential doseexpansion phase patient consent biomarker sample collection eligible participate trial ( Note : One extra bone aspirate sample C2D1 optional per protocol ) . 11 . Able sign inform consent comply protocol 12 . Patient able swallow capsule Exclusion criterion : 1 . Prior exposure HDAC inhibitor compound use treatment MM 2 . Patients Refractory MM ( i.e . patient refractory prior therapy ) prior previous line therapy : either never reach response well SD whose disease progress best response still therapy whose disease progress within 60 day last dose therapy 3 . Patients prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation show evidence active graftversushost disease graftversushost disease require immunosuppressive therapy . 4 . Patient grade 1 peripheral neuropathy pain grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy clinical examination within 14 day first study treatment 5 . Impaired cardiac function clinically significant cardiac disease , include one following : Patients congenital long QT syndrome History presence sustain ventricular tachyarrhythmia . ( Patients history atrial arrhythmia eligible discuss Sponsor prior enrollment ) Any history ventricular fibrillation torsade de pointes Bradycardia define HR &lt; 50 bpm . Patients pacemaker eligible HR ≥ 50 bpm . Screening ECG QTc &gt; 450 msec Right bundle branch block + leave anterior hemiblock ( bifascicular block ) Patients myocardial infarction unstable angina ≤ 6 month prior start study drug Other clinically significant heart disease ( e.g. , CHF NY Heart Association class III IV , uncontrolled hypertension , history labile hypertension , history poor compliance antihypertensive regimen ) 6 . Impairment GI function GI disease may significantly alter absorption PAN 7 . Patient unresolved diarrhea ≥ CTCAE grade 2 8 . Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition ( e.g. , uncontrolled diabetes , active uncontrolled infection , acute diffuse pulmonary disease , pericardial disease , uncontrolled thyroid dysfunction ) include abnormal laboratory value , could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol 9 . Patients use medication relative risk prolong QT interval induce torsade de pointes treatment discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug 10 . Patients need valproic acid medical condition study within 5 day prior first PAN treatment . 11 . Patients receive targeted agent within 2 week within 5 halflives agent active metabolite ( ever longer ) recover side effect therapy . 12 . Patients receive either immunotherapy within ≤ 8 week ; chemotherapy within ≤ 4 week ; radiation therapy &gt; 30 % marrowbearing bone within ≤ 2 week prior start study treatment ; yet recover side effect therapy . 13 . Patients receive steroid ( e.g . Dex ) ≤ 2 week prior start study treatment recover side effect therapy . Concomitant therapy medication include corticosteroid allow patient receive &lt; 10 mg prednisone equivalent indicate medical condition , 100 mg hydrocortisone premedication administration certain medication blood product enrol study . 14 . Patients undergone major surgery ≤ 4 week prior start study drug recover side effect therapy 15 . Women pregnant breast feed woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) willing use double method contraception study 3 month treatment . One method contraception must barrier method . WOCBP define woman undergone hysterectomy naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day first administration oral PAN 16 . Male patient whose sexual partner WOCBP use double method contraception study 3 month treatment . One method contraception must condom 17 . Patients prior malignancy last 3 year ( except basal squamous cell carcinoma , situ cancer cervix ) 18 . Patients significant history noncompliance medical regimen unwilling unable comply instruction give him/her study staff . 19 . Patients show intolerance BTZ Dex component drug contraindication one drug , follow locally applicable prescribe information Other protocol define inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply</criteria>
