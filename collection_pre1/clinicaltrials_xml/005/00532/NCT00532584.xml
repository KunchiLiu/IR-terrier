	<brief_summary>Cigarette smoking main risk factor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . The cell line lung airway ( epithelium ) cell surface epithelium ( alveolar macrophage ) healthy smoker develop characteristic gene expression change different nonsmoker . These gene expression change include up- down-regulation gene functional category know relevant development COPD . Administration anti-inflammatory medication ( inhaled steroid ) combination long acting medication open airway ( bronchodilator ) , know decrease rate acute exacerbation improve quality life individual COPD ; however , mechanism underlie beneficial effect poorly understood . This study assess effect traditional therapy COPD ( inhaled corticosteroid , anti-inflammatory medication , plus bronchodilator , medication help open airway ) smoking-induced gene change airway epithelium alveolar macrophage . Volunteer subject evaluate bronchoscopy sample lung cell 0 , 7 14 day , therapy give day 1 day 7 . The bronchoscopy aspect study cover approve Weill-Cornell IRB protocol # 0005004439 ( see . ) To participate protocol , research subject first enrol Weill-IRB protocol # 0005004439 entitle `` Evaluation Lungs Normal ( Smokers , Ex-smokers , Non-Smokers ) Individuals Segmental Bronchopulmonary Lung Lavage , Bronchial Brushing , Bronchial Wall Biopsy '' , fulfil inclusion/exclusion criterion protocol . They invite participate protocol meet additional inclusion/exclusion criterion protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess effect inhale beclomethasone ( inhaled corticosteroid ) pattern lung airway epithelium alveolar macrophage gene expression healthy smoker . We hypothesize administration beclomethasone result reversibility airway epithelium alveolar macrophage gene expression change induce cigarette smoking . Background . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , include chronic bronchitis emphysema , occur 15 20 % individual smoke , lead cause disease mortality US ( 1 , 2 ) . Cigarette smoke find cause approximately 90 % case COPD US ( 1 , 2 ) . The human lung airway epithelium receives initial brunt cigarette smoking , airway epithelium alveolar macrophage play central role development COPD ( 3-6 ) . Asymptomatic healthy smoker increase rate cell proliferation airway epithelium consistent concept airway epithelium smoker undergoes molecular change precede development COPD ( 7 ) . Similarly , smoke increase number activate alveolar macrophage present alveoli human lung lead release various mediator involve pathogenesis COPD ( 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 ) . Assessment human lung airway epithelium alveolar macrophage gene expression healthy smoker compare healthy non-smoking individual demonstrate epithelium large small airway alveolar macrophage up- down-regulate variety gene relevant pathogenesis COPD ( 10-15 ) . The differential gene expression epithelium smoker compare nonsmoker comprises gene various function , include gene involve inflammation , cell repair , cell differentiation , cell death , detoxification , cell signal . While airway epithelium target stress cigarette smoking , alveolar macrophage ( pulmonary representative bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocyte system ) activate smoking , release variety mediator injure fragile lung structure ( 4 , 6 , 16 ) . Thus , airway epithelium injured smoking , alveolar macrophage contribute smoking-induced injury . Many study vitro vivo animal human demonstrate role airway epithelium alveolar macrophage development COPD release various pro-inflammatory mediator , mediator involve cell apoptosis , proteolysis , airway remodel obstruction contribute characteristic finding inflammation obstruction observe airways individual COPD ( 3-9 , 17 , 18 ) . Beclomethasone one medication administer inhalation individual moderate severe COPD result reduction hospitalization approximately 30 % , increase quality life , decrease reduction lung function ( 19 , 20 ) . Interestingly , beclomethasone one medication administer inhalation follow hospitalization acute exacerbation individual COPD , result low re-hospitalization rate . The mechanism inhale steroid result clinical improvement increase quality life individual moderate severe COPD follow acute exacerbation poorly understood ( 19-24 ) .</detailed_description>
