	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : -To determine specific biomarkers ( Troponin I B-type natriuretic peptide [ BNP ] ) detect cardiotoxicity earlier standard clinical mean patient receive Sunitinib Malate ( SU11248 ) Sorafenib chemotherapy . Secondary Objective : -To prospectively evaluate incidence severity cardiac toxicity relate sunitinib sorafenib chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Detection Cardiotoxicity During Sunitinib Sorafenib Chemotherapy Using Cardiac Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Blood Tests : Some chemotherapy know cause damage heart muscle cell , result heart failure . Often , damage detect heart failure already occur . Some study show blood test , troponin I and/or T , BNP may useful detect heart damage earlier test currently perform ( echocardiogram electrocardiogram ) . Several study show measure BNP level useful diagnosis heart failure . BNP produce chamber heart response pressure overload amount blood , connected abnormality patient treat doxorubicin . Short-term increase BNP see patient give single dose anthracycline , patient BNP level stay elevate appear great risk develop heart-related side effect . BNP also show elevate development type heart problem patient undergo high-dose chemotherapy stem cell transplantation . Other biomarkers early doxorubicin side effect , level troponins I T blood , recently show raise change LVEF ( Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction : percentage blood empty left ventricle heart contraction ) appearance heart symptom . There current standard blood test . The use biomarkers ( blood test ) predict heart-related side effect fully test proven effective time . Study Visits : If find eligible take part study , 8 study visit , include baseline ( screen ) visit end-of-study visit . Visit 1 2 week begin chemotherapy . You study visit every 4-6 week ( Visits 2-6 ) . At VISIT 1 , follow test procedure perform : - You complete questionnaire symptom may experience . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood drawn routine blood test part standard-of-care . During standard-of-care blood draw , additional blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn test troponin I and/or T BNP level . At VISIT 2 , follow test procedure perform : - You repeat questionnaire symptom may experience . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood drawn routine blood test part standard-of-care . During standard-of-care blood draw , additional blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn test troponin I and/or T BNP level . - If study doctor think necessary , ECG . - If study doctor think necessary , echocardiogram . At VISITS 3 , 5 , 6 , follow test procedure perform : - If study doctor think necessary , repeat symptom questionnaire . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood drawn routine blood test part standard-of-care . During standard-of-care blood draw , additional blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn test troponin I and/or T BNP level . At VISIT 4 , follow test procedure perform : - You repeat symptom questionnaire . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood drawn routine blood test part standard-of-care . During standard-of-care blood draw , additional blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn test troponin I and/or T BNP level . - You ECG . - You echocardiogram . At time study , doctor think necessary , ECG and/or echocardiogram . Length Study : This study last 6 month . End-of-Study Visit : About 6 month begin chemotherapy , end-of-study visit . At visit follow test procedure perform : - You fill repeat symptom questionnaire . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood drawn routine blood test part standard-of-care . During standard-of-care blood draw , additional blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn test troponin I and/or T BNP level . - You ECG . - You echocardiogram . This investigational study . Up 200 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
