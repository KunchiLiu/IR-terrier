	<brief_title>Efficacy Lapaquistat Acetate Co-Administered With Statins Subjects With Hypercholesterolemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dyslipidemias group metabolic disorder produce raised concentration lipoprotein , especially low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , lipoprotein transport endogenous cholesterol liver peripheral tissue . Increased cholesterol triglyceride level lead increase risk arteriosclerosis , underlie cause heart attack , stroke peripheral vascular disease . Despite change lifestyle availability potent lipid-lowering agent , cardiovascular disease continue major cause death Western Europe North America . Serum cholesterol level exceed 5 mmol/L ( 193 mg/dL ) common adult Britain much Europe , United States , Australia New Zealand . This study evaluate efficacy safety lapaquistat acetate take either torvastatin , simvastatin , rosuvastatin , pravastatin , fluvastatin lovastatin ( stable statin therapy ) subject hypercholesterolemia . Total participation time study expect 12 week , optional , 48-week , open-label extension period participant qualify .</detailed_description>
