	<brief_summary>The drug investigation study RhuDex® expect used oral treatment rheumatoid arthritis . Normal stomach juice contain acid previous study show acidity reduces solubility therefore absorption RhuDex® . Administering alkaline buffer meglumine RhuDex® show increase solubility RhuDex® decrease stomach acidity . The purpose study determine : - optimum level meglumine require achieve best uptake RhuDex® stomach blood - determine concentration RhuDex® blood presence optimum level meglumine - investigate safety tolerability RhuDex® . The study conduct healthy male volunteer .</brief_summary>
