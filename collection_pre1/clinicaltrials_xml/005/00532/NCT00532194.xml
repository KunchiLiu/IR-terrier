	<brief_title>An RCT Concurrent Maintenance Cediranib Women With Platinum-sensitive Relapsed Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ICON6 randomise three-arm , two stage , double-blind , placebo-controlled multicentre Gynaecologic Cancer InterGroup ( GCIG ) phase III trial . All patient receive 6 cycle platinum-based chemotherapy . Trial drug administer 18 month randomisation progression , whichever sooner . Patients progress 18 month randomisation continue Trial Drug progression , opinion clinician patient continue clinical benefit . Patients Arm A ( reference arm ) receive platinum-based chemotherapy regimen plus daily oral placebo tablet duration chemotherapy 18 month randomisation progression . Patients Arm B ( concurrent cediranib arm ) also receive platinum-based chemotherapy regimen plus daily oral cediranib chemotherapy , oral daily placebo tablet 18 month randomisation progression . Patients Arm C ( concurrent maintenance cediranib arm ) also receive platinum-based chemotherapy regimen plus oral cediranib daily chemotherapy continue 18 month randomisation progression .</detailed_description>
