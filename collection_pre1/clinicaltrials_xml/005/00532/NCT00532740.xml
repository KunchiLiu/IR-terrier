	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Internal radiation therapy use radioactive material place directly near tumor kill tumor cell . Using radiolabeled glass bead kill tumor cell may effective treatment liver cancer remove surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well radiolabeled glass bead work treat patient metastatic liver cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Provide supervised access treatment yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres ( TheraSphere® ) eligible patient candidate surgical resection metastatic intrahepatic carcinoma . - Evaluate patient experience toxicity associate yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres treatment . OUTLINE : This humanitarian device exemption use study . Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres ( TheraSphere® ) liver tumor percutaneously place catheter hepatic artery . Patients may receive additional therapy 4-12 week initial treatment discretion study physician . After completion study therapy , patient follow 2 week , 30 day , year approximately 2 year .</detailed_description>
