	<brief_summary>Inexperienced rescuer may encounter severe problem unconscious patient open maintain upper airway patent . Designing ventilate device could indicate open upper airway correctly may beneficial . The head child randomly place different head position one investigator . A ventilate mask press gently child 's face follow measurement head position angle pulmonary function . This information could utilised optimise assist ventilation unprotected upper airway child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ventilation basic life support improve survival cardiac arrest patient significantly . Unfortunately , contrast willingness potential rescuer perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation . For example , although healthcare professional would perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation 4-year old drown child &gt; 90 % case , likelihood would decrease ~10 % case young male unconscious patient San Francisco public bus . Possibly , lay rescuer would perform assisted ventilation often simple ventilation device available . However , willingness perform assist ventilation plus ability open maintain airway patent necessary ensure efficient ventilation unconscious patient unprotected upper airway . Since retention skill basic life support class notoriously low , resuscitation tool incorporate self-explanatory feature improve applicability , provide built-in safety . Thus , option could ensure open airway use built-in indicator within ventilate device confirm correct head extension . One possible approach may determine head position make open airway likely , extrapolate angle scale could integrate ventilate device ; however , safe head extension need determine first prevent harm . The purpose study determine head position angle reflect neutral position maximal extension unconscious supine child first step design ventilate device optimise ventilation unprotected upper airway .</detailed_description>
