	<brief_summary>Our hypothesis : Obese subject physician 's make diagnosis asthma poor asthma control asthmatic normal weight , less variability peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) bronchodilator response , increase induced sputum systemic marker inflammation increase prevalence atopy . Obese subject increase incidence co-morbidities rhinosinusitis , gastroesophageal reflux sleep apnea syndrome . This study aim determine , comparison asthmatic normal weight , pair age sex , obese subject asthma ( use anti-inflammatory agent ) show : - A uncontrolled asthma , increase health care use poorer quality life - A reduced response bronchodilator diurnal variability expiratory flow - More marked airway inflammation evidence systemic inflammatory response - An increased prevalence co-morbidities influence report respiratory symptom severity disease , esophageal reflux symptom , upper airway disease ( rhinitis ) sleep apnea syndrome sleep disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterisation Asthma Obese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Questionnaires respiratory symptom , health care use , quality life , medication asthma control administer thoracic examination perform . Spirometry bronchodilator response , blood test inflammatory parameter , pH measurement exhale air condensate sputum induction perform . Peak expiratory flow measure recorded diary card one week . On second visit , measure lung volume methacholine challenge perform .</detailed_description>
