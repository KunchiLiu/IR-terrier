	<brief_summary>The long-term goal project utilize newly available high-speed optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) technology guide surgical treatment corneal disease . OCT well know exquisite resolution , recently sufficient speed capture shape cornea eye motion OCT scanning . The development Fourier-domain ( FD ) OCT technology make requisite speed possible . The objective project develop method image cornea FD-OCT system precisely measure corneal shape use information guide surgery . Cataract surgery patient previous laser vision correction often lead significant near- far-sightedness , problem could resolve use accurate intraocular lens power selection formula base measurement corneal refractive power OCT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraocular Lens Power Calculation After Laser Refractive Surgery Based Optical Coherence Tomography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study new image method study front part eye . This image method call Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) provide detailed cross-sectional ( layer ) view structure eye . The OCT system scan beam light across eye take picture . OCT provide detailed image image method eye ultrasound , CT scan ( compute tomography ) MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) . In addition , OCT image touch eye . OCT routinely use image structure back eye ( retina ) cornea . This study use high-speed FDA approve OCT system . The propose research plan combination clinical study software development perform synergistically . Clinical study provide OCT image image processing software development test . The image processing software provide automate measurement anatomic parameter essential clinical use . Cataract extraction IOL implantation common eye surgery . The power IOL implant calculate 2 measurement : axial eye length ( AL ) keratometric power ( K ) . The Holladay II formula also use external corneal diameter ( `` white-to-white '' WTW ) anterior chamber depth ( ACD ) . These formulae work well ( Â±0.5D ) normal eye . However , formulae lead bias unpredictable refractive result eye refractive surgery procedure LASIK , PRK , RK . With large number patient undergo refractive surgery every year , problem become severe . The conventional IOL formula fail several inherent assumption longer true eye refractive surgery . These assumption : 1 ) The corneal refractive power uniform . 2 ) The anterior posterior corneal power fix relationship overall corneal refractive power calculate anterior keratometry ( topography ) use keratometric index . 3 ) The position IOL predict K without additional information WTW ACD . Relative posterior curvature , anterior curvature become flat myopic correction steeper hyperopic correction LASIK PRK . To adapt conventional IOL formula situation , surgeon use rigid contact lens over-refraction calculate `` effective K. '' However , accuracy refraction cataract patient poor due poor vision . Alternatively , one could use historical method calculate effective K pre-refractive surgery value . However , measurement often longer available . If many year lapse , historical value may longer accurately reflect current shape cornea . The axial position IOL determine position lens zonule capsule turn related corneal curvature ( K ) normal eye . A flatter cornea ( low K ) usually associate large anterior segment , lens apparatus locate back . A complex model also use separately measure white-to-white corneal diameter may even accurate . In post-refractive surgery eye , however , K alter long normal relationship size eye . One way get around enter pre-refractive surgery K. However , historical information always available . We believe good solution would use entirely different approach depend 3 assumption . Since OCT separately measure corneal anterior posterior surface AC lens dimension , believe potential basis much well IOL calculation formula .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The subject patient seek cataract surgery implantation monofocal IOLs ( include toric IOLs ) multifocal accommodative IOLs . Subjects postlaser vision correction ( LVC ) previous LASIK , PRK , laser subepithelial keratectomy ( LASEK ) , epiLASIK ( surface laser ablation microkeratomecreated epithelial flap ) RK . The postLVC group subdivide previous hyperopic LVC previous myopic LVC . Inability give inform consent . Inability maintain stable fixation OCT imaging . Inability commit require visit complete study . Eyes concurrent cataract , retinal disease , glaucoma , eye condition may limit visual outcome surgery .</criteria>
