	<brief_summary>Parenteral iron therapy commonly administer dialysis patient majority patient receive therapy part treatment anemia . Although intravenous iron improve clinical response recombinant erythropoietin , concern iron therapy may deleterious effect Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) patient . Iron damage tissue catalyze conversion hydrogen peroxide free-radical ion attack cellular protein , DNA membrane part oxidative stress . Numerous vitro study show tissue toxicity iron increase infectious potential . Oxidative stress also lead activation systemic inflammatory response release number key cytokine growth factor . There link inflammation , oxidative stress acceleration vascular disease patient normal well reduce renal function . In study compare normal versus low hematocrit level hemodialysis patient , mortality high normal hematocrit group . The major difference two group attribute fact patient normal hematocrit group receive significantly iron patient low hematocrit . There 2.4 fold great mortality rate patient receive parenteral iron . The effect parenteral iron administration activation systemic inflammatory response hemodialysis patient evaluate . The purpose study measure number key cytokine , inflammatory oxidative stress marker hemodialysis patient receive iron repletion therapy part standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design Patients prescribe iron repletion therapy ( 100 mg IV every dialysis treatment ten treatment ) primary nephrologist recruit study . Baseline blood sample obtain dialysis treatment two dialysis treatment prior administration iron . On day dialysis iron therapy start , blood sample obtain dialysis treatment via patient 's vascular access . This procedure repeat dialysis treatment ten session patient receive intravenous iron . Subsequently , pre-dialysis blood sample obtain every week four week administration intravenous iron complete</detailed_description>
