	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES This randomize , control trial test hypothesis replication-competent adenovirus-mediated suicide gene therapy combination 80 Gy intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IRMT ) improve freedom failure ( FFF ) relative 80 Gy IMRT alone patient newly-diagnosed prostate cancer intermediate-risk profile . The trial contain two treatment arm : Arm 1- Gene Therapy + IMRT Arm 2- IMRT The study stratify clinical site pre-treatment risk factor ( e.g. , % positive biopsy core , Gleason score . - Gleason score 5/6 AND PSA &lt; 10 ng/mL ; AND &gt; =50 % positive biopsy core - ( Gleason score 5/6 PSA 10-20 ng/mL ) OR ( Gleason score 7 PSA 0 - 20 ng/mL ) ; AND &lt; 50 % positive biopsy core - Gleason score 5/6 PSA 10-20 ng/mL ) OR ( Gleason score 7 PSA 0-20 ng/mL ) AND &gt; =50 % positive biopsy core . An interim safety analysis ( Interim Analysis 1 ) conduct first 21 patient investigational therapy arm , total 42 subject arm , complete 90 day toxicity assessment follow randomization ( phase 2 component ) . If , point , safety concern determine Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) , trial continue phase 3 study two additional interim analysis ( Interim Analyses 2 &amp; 3 ) . The primary analysis treatment efficacy base randomized subject . Primary To assess relative efficacy replication-competent adenovirus-mediated suicide gene therapy combination 80 Gy intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) versus 80 Gy IMRT alone patient newly-diagnosed prostate cancer intermediate-risk profile . The primary endpoint freedom failure ( FFF ) ( biochemical clinical ) . Secondary To assess difference two treatment arm : - Acute ( &lt; = 90 day ) long-term ( &gt; 90 day ) toxicity . - Prostate biopsy status ( 12 core ) 2 year . - Freedom distant metastasis . - Disease-specific overall survival . - Quality life . Exploratory To examine : - Possible effect gene therapy PSA doubling time ( PSADT ) PSA failure . - Possible association primary secondary outcome Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-ADP adenovirus persistence ( measured adenoviral DNA blood ) . - Possible association primary secondary outcome specific immunological endpoint include level circulate CD4+ CD8+ T lymphocytes , T-cell proliferation response , cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) response , development antibody prostate-specific antigen .</detailed_description>
