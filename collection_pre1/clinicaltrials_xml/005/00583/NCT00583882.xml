	<detailed_description>Aim : To determine incidence infection three primary schedule central venous catheter exchange pediatric burn patient create system minimize infectious risk patient population . Hypothesis : A strategy routine catheter change without guidewire exchange result infection decrease risk mechanical complication frequent guidewire exchange frequent new-site replacement . Background : Reviews burn child implied safe change CVCs weekly basis , either new site insertion wire exchange . In non-burn population routine use wire exchange may increase infectious risk . Laboratory investigation show long catheter place , often colonized bacteria ; translate increase catheter infection patient sepsis . Centers Disease Control recommendations note catheter routinely change . The burn literature disagree concept , proffer change microbial milieu burn wound increase infection risk , national data indicate burn unit three four time higher rate catheter relate bloodstream infection intensive care unit . There trend existent retrospective data use wire change central venous catheter increase risk infection : CVCs change new site infection rate 16.6 per 1000 catheter day , whereas change mean wire rate 25.2 per 1000 catheter day . Methods : Patients randomize three intervention group : frequent ( 6 day ) move catheter new site ; alternate schedule wire exchange new site ( every 6 12 day ) ; le frequent move catheter new site ( 12 day ) without wire exchange . This project require enough patient show difference three intervention group . A significant decrease infection rate would current 20 infection per 1000 catheter day approximately 15 per 1000 catheter day . This would require minimum 1000 catheter day per group .</detailed_description>
