	<brief_summary>Specific Aim : To determine effect phosphorus additives educational intervention serum phosphorus level . Hypothesis : Educating dialysis patient regard phosphate contain additive result improve serum phosphorus level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phosphorus Improvement Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The amount phosphorus American diet increase considerably , primarily phosphorus-containing additive convenience ready eat food ( Calvo 1996 ) . It estimate , depend individual food choice , additives add much 1000 mg/day phosphorus diet ( Bell ) . Phosphorus additives almost entirely absorbed 60 % naturally occur phosphorus absorb ( Uribarri 2003 ) . Education regard high phosphorus food key component hyperphosphatemia management ( Ford 2004 , Cupisti 2004 ) , use phosphorus additive may make difficult patient dietitian estimate phosphorus content food . It suggest hyperphosphatemia nutritional barrier prevent renal bone disease intervention focus phosphate contain food additive great potential ( Sherman ) . Our objective determine effect educational intervention regard phosphate additive serum phosphorus 300 chronic hemodialysis patient Centers Dialysis Care ( CDC ) Fresenius Medical Care ( FMC ) Cuyahoga County . Facilities randomize intervention control group . All dietitian eligible patient intervention facility invite take part intervention . All dietitian consent eligible patient control facility form usual care group . Prior trial , demographic medical characteristic , lab data medication collect previous three month use chart abstraction patient interview form . Demographic characteristic include age , sex , race , education insurance status . Medical characteristic include dialysis dose , binder prescription , vitamin D dosing , cause renal failure , number month dialysis , major co-morbid condition . Lab data include albumin , calcium , phosphorus , serum bicarbonate , PTH . Medication data include binder prescription bone medication . In first month trial study coordinator meet intervention control subject assess basic knowledge regard phosphorus content food label reading . Intervention subject also receive education regard phosphorus additive effect phosphorus content food , laminate card list common phosphorus additive , handout additive food fast food restaurant eat . The subject instruct use material shop eat avoid phosphorous additive . During 2nd month trial , study coordinator contact intervention subject phone reinforce educational material answer question . Control subject contact ask shop eat habit . During 3rd month interview month 1 repeat intervention control subject assess change knowledge . Intervention subject also ask evaluate phosphorus additive tool provide feedback evaluate ease use utility . Having control group receive attention key intervention ( phosphorus contain additive education tool ) allow u distinguish effect attention effect intervention . Chart abstraction data lab , dialysis dose , binder prescription , vitamin D dose collect three month trial .</detailed_description>
