	<brief_summary>Understanding whether viral replication occur brain chronic untreated HIV-1 infection undeniable importance , implication treatment research priority . Evidence suggest viral replication CNS occur extremes HIV-1 disease . Brain involvement report acute infection , convince evidence CNS viral replication HIV-associated dementia ( HAD ) advance AIDS . Some human primate data suggest viral RNA protein may absent brain individual chronic untreated HIV-1 infection despite abundant proviral DNA . However , extent viral replication brain know 42 million people worldwide live untreated HIV-1 infection . Why viral replication brain pivotal issue ? Microglial cell macrophages primary target intrathecal HIV-1 replication , promote neuronal injury direct effect gp120 tat , indirect induction toxic mediator . Low-grade injury year decade would likely deleterious , particularly population age . Because treatment guideline allow systemic HIV-1 replication continue CD4+ T cell count decline considerably , antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) recommend many person live HIV . Demonstrating replication brain chronic HIV-1 infection may affect treatment strategy encourage investigation . Identifying factor modulate intrathecal viral replication equally important . Anti-HIV-1 cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) partially control systemic viral replication delay disease progression . Although available data provocative , role anti-HIV CTL CNS receive little attention . To fill gap examine relationship intrathecal viral replication , CTL responses , glial activation/proliferation HIV-1 infection . These study relevant AIDS inflammatory disease CNS well .</brief_summary>

Platelet count &gt; 100,000 cells/mm3 recent determination within 60 day prior first study lumbar puncture . Normal prothrombin time ( PT ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) recent determination within 60 day prior first study lumbar puncture . Among individual past ART experience , ability construct ART regimen predict completely suppress plasma HIV1 RNA , base result viral susceptibility test do routine part clinical practice . Plasma HIV1 RNA &gt; 20,000 copies/mL . Additional Inclusion Criteria Groups A1 A2 . Group A1 : CD4+ T cell count &gt; 200 cells/mm3 . CSF HIV1 RNA &gt; 2,000 copies/mL screen lumbar puncture . No history significant allergy beta lactam antibiotic , include penicillin cephalosporin . No history allergy vancomycin . Group A2 : CD4+ T cell count &lt; 200 cells/mm3 .
