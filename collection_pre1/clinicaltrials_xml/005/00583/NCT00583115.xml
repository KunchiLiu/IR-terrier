	<brief_title>Safety Study Gleevec® Children With Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension ( IPAH ) rare progressive disease child adults high mortality right heart failure . Platelet derive growth factor ( PDGF ) implicate pulmonary artery remodel vascular proliferation pathologic hallmark IPAH . Animal clinical data support hypothesis activation PDGF receptor critical development IPAH , inhibition PDGF signal pathway may potential therapeutic target . Gleevec tyrosine kinase inhibitor develop treatment certain cancer inhibits PDGF receptor . Animal preliminary clinical data suggest Gleevec reverse vascular remodel improve right heart failure . A small clinical trial adult IPAH ongoing Europe , trials child disease bad prognosis . This project phase II , single dose pilot study generate hypothesis activation PDGF receptor critical development IPAH , inhibition PDGF signal pathway potential therapeutic target . Five patient age 8 yr 18 yr severe IPAH recruit nationally , 6 month trial Imatinib . The Specific Aim study collect preliminary data safety efficacy Gleevec child IPAH . Results study need develop large , multi-center trial determine efficacy therapeutic impact Gleevec child IPAH . The long term goal work develop novel therapeutic strategy treatment IPAH child . This translational study inhibition PDGF receptor child IPAH could provide insight etiology IPAH major impact development new treatment strategy child adult pulmonary artery hypertension multiple origin .</detailed_description>
