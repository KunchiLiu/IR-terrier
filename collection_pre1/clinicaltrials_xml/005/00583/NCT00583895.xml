	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis one common skin disease , lifetime prevalence 20 % , increase number case . Although variety treatment number specific medication treat chronic disease limit often helpful , especially severe case . In addition , treatment may use limited period less effective long term ( tachyphylaxis ) . The development new compound mandatory treatment often chronically recur disease . The current trial determine efficacy , safety tolerability endogenous compound imidazole-4-carboxylic acid ( ImCOOH ) administer topical cream twice daily 14 day patient atopic dermatitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study ImCOOH Cream Patients Suffering From Moderate Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase IIa , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , intra-individual left-right limb comparison trial investigate efficacy , local irritation , safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics multiple topical application ImCOOH cream . The trial population consist 25 patient moderate atopic dermatitis . Twenty patient receive hydrophilic cream contain 10 % ImCOOH placebo cream randomize limbs twice daily 14 day additional morning application Day 15 . Five patient receive placebo cream limbs twice daily 14 day additional morning application Day 15 . The cream apply 2 comparative target area ( minimum 0.1 % maximum 2 % total body surface area per target area ) , one site leave limb one site right limb . The applied cream need prevent wiping . Efficacy assess Day 15 safety tolerability monitor 14 day last application . Efficacy assess determine Topical Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index ( toADSI ) score , Visual Analogue Scale Pruritis ( VAS ) score target area screening , predose Day 1 treatment Days 2 , 7 , 9 , 12 15 treatment . In addition , color picture target area take predose Day 1 treatment Days 7 15 treatment . Finally Eczema Area Severity Index ( EASI ) score determine target area , predose Day 1 treatment Days 7 15 treatment . Safety assess monitoring ( S ) AEs , perform clinical laboratory test ( hematology , biochemistry , urinalysis ) physical exam take vital sign record ECGs regular basis . For pharmacokinetic analysis , plasma concentration ImCOOH determine Days 1 15 12 hour postdose . In addition , morning predose plasma concentration ImCOOH determine Days 2 , 4 , 7 , 9 , 12 . Full urinary output collect Day 15 12 hour postdose determine amount unchanged ImCOOH excrete urine . In patient receive placebo cream , endogenous ImCOOH concentration plasma urine measure .</detailed_description>
