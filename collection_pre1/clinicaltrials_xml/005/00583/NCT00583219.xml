	<brief_title>Botulin-A Toxin Instillations Overactive Bladder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : To date , standard treatment overactive bladder ( include detrusor hyperreflexia detrusor overactivity ) consist oral anticholinergic medication troublesome side effect variable efficacy . What 's , patient fail pharmacological therapy must either live malady undergo open surgery irreversible carry prolong convalescence . The fact remain however treatment overactive bladder necessary help maintain quality life prevent upper urinary tract deterioration . In recent year , cystoscopic-guided injection Botulinum-A toxin use novel method address detrusor hyperreflexia overactivity block acetylcholine transmission bladder . The obvious benefit target therapy notwithstanding , method require use cystoscope , needle delivery agent approximately 30 separate injection sit either regional topical intravesical anesthesia peri-operative pain control . Clearly , identification less invasive cost effective mean deliver beneficial effect Botulinum-A toxin bladder muscle potential enhance overall appeal treatment method . Objectives : The primary objective pilot study evaluate safety efficacy direct instillation Botulinum-A toxin/DMSO bladder via catheter system mean treat woman symptom overactive bladder secondary urinary incontinence . In , focus estimate percentage woman experience improvement urinary incontinence symptom one month three month follow novel instillation technique . Study Design : We propose single center , Phase II pilot study investigation . In proposal , 25 sterile woman 18-90 year age urodynamic evidence detrusor overactivity , hyperreflexia symptom overactive bladder syndrome lack evidence infection stress incontinence offer bladder instillation Botulinum-A toxin DMSO carrier agent fail anticholinergic medication tolerate pharmacological side effect . We use two validated measurement tool determine urinary incontinence severity . These measurement tool administer woman baseline one month three-month follow-up time point . Our analysis also focus identify describe adverse event among woman estimate percentage woman experience successful improvement urinary incontinence symptom . Study Duration : Patients sign inform consent screen eligibility . Once determine eligible study , patient schedule baseline evaluation instillation Botox/DMSO . Patients follow one month three month . Patients remove study withdraw consent , experience one study stop criterion ( case entire study stop ) complete final follow-up evaluation three-months .</detailed_description>
