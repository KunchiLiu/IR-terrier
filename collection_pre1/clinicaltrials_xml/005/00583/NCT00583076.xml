	<brief_summary>The aim study assess safety efficacy investigational agent , AST-120 , treat patient active pouchitis . This open-label trial mean patient receive AST-120 2g sachet ( packet ) three time day 4 week . All antibiotic , probiotic nutritional agent must discontinue least 2 week prior study entry . An initial group 10 patient enrol . If serious adverse event associate study drug least 3 10 patient respond , second group 10 patient enrol . In second group patient , patient consider responder remission eligible receive open-label AST-120 long response maintain maximum 52 week . Patients clinic visit start study week 4 . If continuing open label AST-120 week 4 , patient clinic visit every 12 week assess continue safety efficacy AST-120 . Endoscopies perform start study , week 4 , week 28 , week 52 early termination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The management prognosis vary different type pouchitis . For antibiotic-responsive pouchitis , first-line therapy include 2-week course metronidazole ciprofloxacin . A relapse course pouchitis common . Of patient acute pouchitis , 61 % would develop least one recurrence . Typically , patient 's symptom endoscopic histologic inflammation respond favorably antibiotic therapy , symptom quickly recur antibiotic discontinue . This group patient classify antibiotic-dependent pouchitis often require long-term antibiotic probiotic therapy keep disease remission . Although majority patient active pouchitis respond favorably antibiotic therapy , relapse common , often require frequent antibiotic therapy . The concern frequent use antibiotic agent : 1 ) antibiotic metronidazole often cause adverse effect ; 2 ) long-term frequent use antibiotic , include ciprofloxacin , metronidazole , rifaximin , often lead bacterial resistance . In clinical practice , encounter patient antibiotic-refractory pouchitis , could largely due overuse antibiotic agent ; 3 ) UC patient IPAA increase risk development intra-abdominal infection , pouch leak , abscess , cholangitis primary sclerosing cholangitis , require antibiotic therapy agent similar agent use pouchitis . Bacterial resistance develop overuse antibiotic pouchitis might jeopardize treatment intra-abdominal infection ; 4 ) overuse antibiotic lead overload certain commensal bacteria pathogenic bacteria , lead pouch inflammation . Therefore , safe effective agent need treat active pouchitis , particularly long-term basis . AST-120 manufacture Kureha Corporation , Japan . The agent approve Japan 1992 treatment patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . It comprise highly adsorptive , porous , spherical carbon particle package 2 g sachet oral administration design treatment gastrointestinal disease . AST-120 consist black microspheres approximately 0.2-0.4 mm diameter high adsorption ability large surface area . Composed mainly carbon ( approximately 96 % ) , clinical utility AST-120 think reside ability adsorb low molecular weight toxin , inflammatory mediator , harmful bile acid product gastrointestinal tract , prevent local toxicity systemic absorption . AST-120 selective adsorption profile certain acidic basic organic compound , significantly low adsorptive capacity activate charcoal digestive enzymes . This study open-label pilot trial patient receive AST-120 2 g sachet three time day ( take meal 10:00 , 3:00 pm , immediately go bed ) 4 complete week . AST-120 tasteless , odorless , oral preparation . To take product , patient tear open sachet , drop content directly tongue wash 8 ounce water . All antibiotic , probiotic nutritional agent must discontinue least 2 week prior study entry . For purpose trial response define &gt; = 3 point reduction 18-point PDAI scoring system . Remission define PDAI score &lt; 7 . The study population consist patient active pouchitis ileal pouch-anal anastomosis Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) present primary symptom increase stool frequency abdominal pain . The diagnosis active pouchitis define PDAI score &gt; 7 point , combine assessment symptom , endoscopy , histology . An initial cohort 10 patient enrol . Based efficacy outcome ( least 3 10 patient respond ) safety outcome ( significant adverse event associate study drug ) second cohort 10 patient treat . Patients second cohort consider responder ( i.e. , least 3 point reduction 18 point PDAI score system ) remission ( PDAI &lt; 7 ) eligible receive open-label AST-120 long response maintain maximum 52 week . If , time , patient relapse ( PDAI &gt; 7 patient remission , increase PDAI least 3 point reduction maintain responder ) , open-label treatment discontinue patient remove study . Patients also discontinue open-label treatment remove study warrant treatment-emergent safety concern , opinion investigator , patient 's best interest discontinue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients current episode active pouchitis ( define PDAI score &gt; 7 ) IPAA UC confirm endoscopy histology Patients active pouchitis never treat antibiotic ( antibioticnaive ) previously treat antibiotic respond . Antibioticdependent patient may enrol long antibiotic use discontinue least two week prior study entry . Antibioticdependent pouchitis define condition patient frequent episode ( &gt; = 4 episode per year ) pouchitis persistent symptom require longterm , continuous antibiotic probiotic therapy keep disease remission .
