	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether vaccination Ad/PSA vaccine induce anti-PSA immunity result destruction remain prostate cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Adenovirus/PSA Vaccine Men With Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Local Therapy APP21</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects randomize Arm A ( vaccine ) Arm B ( androgen deprivation therapy plus vaccine ) . On Arm A , subject begin three vaccination immediately . On Arm B , subject start androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) 14 day prior begin vaccination . Subjects vaccinate three time , injection administer 30-day interval . Based upon early clinical trial , vaccine consider safe induce major side effect . The investigator hope vaccination PSA virus cause body produce immunity PSA immunity destroy cell produce PSA . Since cell leave body produce PSA cancer cell , investigator propose vaccination ensue anti-PSA immunity kill prostate cancer cell . Importantly , treatment cause major side effect would treatment anti-cancer drug .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men prostate cancer receive prior local therapy ( radical prostatectomy definitive radiation therapy ) biochemical ( PSA ) relapse without evidence radiographic clinical metastatic disease . For men prior prostatectomy , surgery must occur least 6 month prior initiation treatment . For men prior definitive radiation therapy , radiation must complete least 1 year prior initiation treatment . Exhibit least three separate rise serum PSA , least one month apart differences &gt; /= 0.03 ng/ml total PSA &gt; 0.2 ng/ml . Have PSA double time &gt; /= 6 month baseline serum PSA &gt; 2 ng/ml . Negative bone scan . Negative CT scan abdomen pelvis ( evidence soft tissue lesion &gt; /= 1 cm ) . Scans must obtain within 6 week entry trial ( initiation treatment ) . Written informed consent . Age &gt; /= 18 year . Required laboratory value [ obtain within 2 week study entry ( initiation treatment ) ] . Serum creatinine &lt; /= 2.0 mg/dL Adequate hematologic function : granulocyte &gt; /= 1800 per mm3 , platelet &gt; /= 100,000 per mm3 , WBC &gt; /= 3700 , lymphocytes &gt; /= 590 . Adequate hepatocellular function : AST &lt; 3x upper limit normal bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl ( unless bilirubin elevation consistent Gilbert 's syndrome ) . PSA use eligibility criterion must draw within 42 day prior injection number 1 redrawn Day 1 use baseline value . Candidates salvage radiation therapy unless patient refuse . Active unresolved clinically significant infection . Parenteral antibiotic &lt; 7 day prior initiation treatment . Evidence prior current CNS metastasis . Specific image necessary absence sign symptom . Comorbid medical condition would result life expectancy ( participation ) less 1 year . Patients compromise immune system ; congenital , acquire , druginduced ( immunosuppressive agent ) exclude study . Use prednisone dose high 10 mg daily ( equipotent steroid dos ) 7 day within last 3 month allow . Nopreexisting malignancy require treatment within past 5 year except basal squamous cell cancer skin . Prior systemic therapy prostate cancer allow ( hormonal therapy , include limited LHRH agonist , antiandrogens , ketoconazole chemotherapy mitoxantrone/taxanes/estramustine , etc . ) except patient stop hormone therapy two year prior enrollment currently normal testosterone level ; patient Arm B , undergo androgen depletion therapy vaccination eligible . Prior participation vaccine study noninfectious disease . The inability understand language clinical protocol . Allergy religious objection pork product ; Gelfoam produce pork .</criteria>
