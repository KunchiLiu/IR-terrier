	<brief_summary>Accurate target treatment site increase local control radiation therapy breast-cancer lumpectomy patient . Currently , ultrasound localization use prostate cancer patient locate prostate daily radiation treatment . There documented evidence lumpectomy site change external radiation therapy . Thus , treatment efficacy increase localize target , monitoring volume change , adjust radiation target prior boost radiation dose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Targeting Lumpectomy Cavity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study participant weekly ultrasound perform lumpectomy cavity determine shift volume change initial treatment-planning CT time radiation boost ( approximately 4 week ) . These ultrasounds do prior weekly doctor 's appointment Radiation Oncology . When time perform radiation boost ( radiation target lumpectomy cavity ) , ultrasound do daily participant treatment position . The SonArray system use ultrasound-driven target prostate cancer utilize . If lumpectomy cavity observe , ultrasound suggest shift note compare shift need standard clinical set . Once subject complete radiation therapy , study participation complete .</detailed_description>

Patients must histologically cytologically confirm breast carcinoma voluntarily elect breast conservation technique ( i.e. , lumpectomy ) Age &gt; 18 year . Breast cancer , restrict adult woman , rare young population . Radiation indicate postsurgical adjuvant treatment breast conservation . Life expectancy great 6 month . Karnofsky great equal 60 The effect radiation therapy develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose abortifacient . For reason , radiation therapy know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Patients recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . The inability visualize reliably contour lumpectomy cavity Radiation Oncology treatment plan CT scan . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement opinion principal investigator . Pregnant woman exclude study radiation therapy potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother standard chemotherapeutic regimen ( applicable ) , breastfeed discontinue mother treated adjuvant chemotherapy .</criteria>
