	<detailed_description>The design study determine efficacy improve upper extremity function tetraplegic subject receive implantable device neuromuscular control . Evaluations make document change performance manipulative task use stimulation system . Subjects consent participate project implantable stimulator surgically place upper extremity control upper extremity . A series test perform implantation , repeat interval implantation ass change subject 's performance . This study non-randomized feasibility study concurrent ( neuroprosthesis ) longitudinal ( pre- post-implantation/training ) self-control . Subjects participate study expect actively involve study two year implantation follow life thereafter . The screening procedure take two day , depend specific evaluation necessary determine candidacy . Pre-surgical exercise conduct least two week . The implantation surgery last one day , three seven day post-surgical hospitalization . Following eight-week exercise program twelve-week training program , subject discharge active rehabilitation phase . They follow quarterly one year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>

Integrity low motor neuron ( peripheral nerve ) muscle activate Adequate range motion joint shoulder , wrist , hand ( upper extremity ) . If acute infection present , subject consider surgery clear . Prior history major chronic systemic infection illness would increase risk surgery . Contraindications include immunologic disease , cardiac arrhythmia , undiagnosed highrisk breast mass , dermatologic condition , major system failure . Acute infection currently present clear .
