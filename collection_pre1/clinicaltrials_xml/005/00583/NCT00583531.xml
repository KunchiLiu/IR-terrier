	<brief_summary>This open-label pilot study patient receive AST-120 4 week . Patients discontinue antibiotic study entry . They may continue previously prescribe treatment ( e.g. , probiotic and/or nutritional agent ) discretion study doctor . The purpose study ass whether investigational medication AST-120 safe effective treatment symptom pouchitis , chronic inflammatory condition , patient whose symptom respond well antibiotic . An initial group 10 patient enrol . If serious side effect associate study drug least 3 10 patient respond , second group 10 patient may enrol . Patients clinic visit start study week 4 . Patients check phone weekly basis symptom response , compliance development side effect . Endoscopies perform start study week 4 early termination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy AST-120 Treatment Antibiotic-Refractory Pouchitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients acute pouchitis typically treat metronidazole ciprofloxacin 10-14 day . Most patient pouchitis respond antibiotic . Patients experience frequent relapse chronic pouchitis require long term maintenance antibiotic . Probiotics may consider alternate chronic antibiotic therapy maintenance remission chronic antibiotic-dependent pouchitis . In practice , would institute maintenance therapy patient relapse least 3 time within one year , within 1 month discontinuation antibiotic . Among patient receive maintenance antibiotic develop loss clinical benefit prolong treatment , rotation three four antibiotic 1-week interval may beneficial . Patients improve single antibiotic may respond combination therapy two antibiotic . If , treat topical oral budesonide . Other option include topical mesalamine ( enemas suppository ) , oral sulfasalazine mesalamine , topical oral steroid , possibly oral bismuth , azathioprine , 6-mercaptopurine infliximab . However , little evidence base therapy literature , many therapy expensive and/or potentially toxic . A therapy suppress immune system , little toxicity would attractive patient antibiotic-refractory pouchitis . AST-120 manufacture Kureha Corporation , Japan . The agent approve Japan 1991 treatment patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . It comprise highly adsorptive , porous , spherical carbon particle package 2 g sachet oral administration design treatment gastrointestinal disease . AST-120 consist black microspheres approximately 0.2-0.4 mm diameter high adsorption ability large surface area . Composed mainly carbon ( approximately 96 % ) , clinical utility AST-120 think reside ability adsorb small molecular weight toxin , inflammatory mediator , harmful bile acid product gastrointestinal tract , prevent local toxicity systemic absorption . AST-120 selective adsorption profile certain acidic basic organic compound , significantly low adsorptive capacity activate charcoal digestive enzyme . In study , patient active pouchitis ileal pouch-anal anastomosis ( IPAA ) Ulcerative Colitis primary symptom increase stool frequency abdominal pain , refractory antibiotic ( respond antibiotic therapy minimum 14 day ) enrol . Patients must active pouchitis confirm endoscopy biopsy within 4 week study entry . The diagnosis active pouchitis define PDAI score &gt; 7 point , combine assessment symptom , endoscopy histology . Eligible patient receive AST-120 sachet 2g three time daily ( TID ) take meal 10:00 , 3:00 pm immediately go bed 4 complete week . AST-120 tasteless , odorless , oral preparation . To take product , patient tear open sachet , drop content directly tongue wash 8 ounce water . Patients evaluate baseline week 4 early termination study physician , include endoscopy histology routine laboratory test . Patients check weekly basis study coordinator phone symptom response , compliance , development adverse event . Quality Life Assessments ( Cleveland Global Quality Life Short Inflammatory Bowel Questionnaire ) conduct baseline week 4 early termination . A patient define complete study treatment he/she receive investigational product follow safety last on-site visit 4 week treatment course . Any co-prescribed medicine must give least 30 minute AST-120 administration . The following drug pouchitis co-prescribed/maintained AST-120 treatment utilization record secondary endpoint : - Antidiarrheal therapy loperamide ( Imodium ) - Nutritional agent Probiotics dose previously prescribe , dose stable 2 week study entry . Antibiotics must stop time entry study . However , antibiotic prescribe treat infection pouchitis allow record . The need prescribe follow drug study constitute treatment failure : - Oral topical corticosteroid - Oral topical 5-ASA - Nutritional agent ( SCFA enema suppository , glutamine , dietary fiber ) - Probiotics - Narcotic-based antidiarrheal agent In addition patient consider fail treatment PDAI score improvement &lt; = 2 point end trial . Patients discontinue study become pregnant warranted treatment-emergent safety concern , opinion investigator , patient 's best interest discontinue study . A first cohort 10 patient treat ; base outcome ( efficacy safety : significant Adverse Event ( AE ) associate study drug least 3/10 patient respond ) second cohort 10 patient may enrol .</detailed_description>
