	<brief_summary>2- [ 18F ] -fluoro-2-deoxyD-glucose positron emission tomography ( FDG PET ) proven valuable clinical tool stag surveillance lymphoma.1-6 Occasionally , lymph node mesentery retroperitoneum difficult distinguish normal bowel activity PET scan despite three-plane cine maximal image projection ( MIP ) imaging . This uncertainty limit clinical usefulness PET case lymphoma.7-8 In addition , bowel activity also hinder interpretation PET scan type solid tumor include melanoma colorectal cancer.6,9,10 Our goal determine well diphenoxylate/atropine 5mg/0.05mg ( Lomotil ) decrease bowel activity decrease impact clinical decision-making , specifically lymphoma stag surveillance . This prospective , randomize , double-blinded study involve 60 patient undergoing PET scan newly diagnose recurrent , untreated lymphoma .</brief_summary>
