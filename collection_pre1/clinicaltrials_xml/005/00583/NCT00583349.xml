	<brief_summary>The intravesical treatment bladder cancer Abraxane desirable taxanes due ability dilute water lipid-based solution allow great access site bladder . Thus , interested investigate Abraxane 's safety , toxicity , efficacy profile treatment recurrent transitional cell cancer urinary bladder combine phase I &amp; II trial . The phase I trial design dose-escalation study cohort three enroll maximum 18 patient . Dose increase occur group three patient , successive group receive increase concentration Abraxane intravesically . No dose increase occur member previous cohort undergone first instillation medication without experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . Any patient experience DLT remove trial treat appropriately . If one patient cohort experience DLT additional three patient enrol treated dose-level . If none additional three patient experience DLT , next group patient start next high dose level . If dose level , two patient experience DLT previous dose level consider maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . An additional three patient ( total six patient ) treat MTD . If less two patient experience DLT dose level establish MTD . The phase II aspect design Simon II stage format satisfy study powering , first stage 10 patient enrol . If 2 successful treatment group ( negative urine cytology bladder biopsy 6 month ) , first stage pas rejection rule , another 19 patient enrol . If point study , total 6 success , phase II aspect consider successful trial study complete point .</brief_summary>
