	<brief_summary>Acute cardiac vascular event , like heart attack sudden cardiac death manifest clear surge early morning hour around time waking , peak onset 6AM 11AM . The mechanism fully understood , show healthy subject impair vascular reactivity early morning ( endothelial dysfunction ) . This associated decrease nitric oxide level ( substance promote vasodilatation ) . We also describe vessel reactivity level substance recover noon people breakfast . L-arginine semi-essential amino acid find large quantity chicken , fish , bean substrate production nitric oxide Therefore want test beneficial effect administration L-arginine circadian pattern vessel reactivity . Our goal understand cardiovascular event likely happen early morning prevent . The research help u understand efficacy , acute effect tolerability high dose L-arginine . This lead future research ass long term effect L-arginine supplement prevent cardiovascular event early morning hour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role L-arginine Endothelial Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute cardiac vascular event , include sudden cardiac death , myocardial infarction , stroke manifest clear surge early morning hour around time waking , peak onset 6 AM 11AM . The mechanisms morning increase acute cardiovascular event fully understood . Factors arousal sleep , increased sympathetic drive , increase vasoconstrictor sensitivity impair endothelial function implicate . We recently describe occurrence early morning endothelial dysfunction , blunt flow-mediated arterial dilatation early hour wake . Our preliminary data suggest early morning endothelial dysfunction likely due increase plasma level L-arginine endogenous inhibitor , ADMA reducted plasma L-arginine level , consequent reduce availability NO morning . The early morning fall NOx level potentiate fast attenuate low-nitrate , protein rich breakfast . Because production NO depend part availability L-arginine , method maintain adequate level plasma L-arginine early morning need . We propose assess efficacy high dose L-arginine prevent early morning endothelial dysfunction . The primary aim examine effect high dos L-arginine morning change nitric oxide endothelial function . Our hypothesis : 1 . That L-arginine administer orally prior sleep prevent early morning decline plasma level L-arginine nitric oxide ; 2 . That L-arginine administer prior sleep attenuate prevent early morning decline endothelial function ; 3 . That effect L-arginine , take prior sleep , plasma level L-arginine nitric oxide endothelial function mark 15 gram L-arginine versus 5 gram L-arginine placebo , indicative dose response effect . Our secondary aim identify short-term tolerability safety two different dos L-arginine . Our hypothesis subject take high dos L-arginine ( 15 gram ) significant symptoms adverse change vital sign .</detailed_description>
