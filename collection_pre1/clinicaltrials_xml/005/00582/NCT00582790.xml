	<brief_summary>This study do see improve response Interleukin-2 add Zoledronic acid . The effectiveness combination drug kidney cancer unknown investigate study . In particular , study evaluate effect combination kidney cancer also examine safety side effect IL-2 Zoledronic acid .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study IL2 Combination With Zoledronic Acid Patients With Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research evaluate antitumor response low-dose Interleukin-2 combination Zoledronic acid subject previously untreated , unresectable metastatic renal cell carcinoma . Also , study assess tolerability , safety , pharmacodynamic effect , immunologic effect low-dose Interleukin-2 combination Zoledronic acid angiogenesis inhibition anti-metastatic potential measuring serum/plasma angiogenic/metastatic factor level quantitating change cytokine expression , antigen-specific T-cell immune response , peripheral gd T-cell frequency function .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm renal cell carcinoma metastasis . Must measurable disease . No prior cytokine , chemotherapy , hormonal , immunobased therapy ( include vaccine cellular base ) renal cancer allow . No prior use bisphosphonates allow . One prior experimental therapy permit long &gt; 4 week pass since last drug administration . ECOG performance status 0 1 Adequate cardiac function history . Pulseoximetry &gt; 92 % room air . Radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Known brain metastases Any history autoimmune disease ( ie . psoriasis , inflammatory bowel disease , etc ) must receive clearance investigator permit study due potential worsening disorder IL Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia . History myocardial infarction hospitalization congestive heart failure within 12 month enrollment . History prior malignancy ( except basal cell carcinoma resect curative intent ) unless resect treated curative intent disease free &gt; 5 year . Any history seizure give increased seizure risk IL2 . Organ allograft ( transplant ) recipient exclude give absolute contraindication IL2 therapy . Pregnant woman exclude Patients systemic steroid ( oral IV ) eligible study .</criteria>
