	<brief_title>The Use RIA Harvest Bone Graft Treatment Non-unions Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early clinical use suggest bone graft obtain human femur use RIA system available large quantity , may associate less pain compare conventional method autograft harvest , may provide bioactive substance addition bone aid healing process . All patient enrol study schedule bone graft fracture nonunion use RIA system , irregardless participation study . There pain associated harvest bone , whether patient enrol study . A total sixteen patient enrol study , eight large ( 2.8 - 5.6 mm ) Beta-Tricalcium Phosphate ( ChronOS ) granules second filter , eight medium ( 1.4 - 2.8 mm ) Beta-Tricalcium Phosphate ( ChronOS ) granule . All patient enrol obtain informed consent . In order eligible study , patient must already schedule bone graft fracture nonunion harvest autologous graft material femur use RIA system . The reaming procedure conduct use trochanteric entry portal tip great trochanter . The reamer size determine use fluoroscopy measure medullary canal isthmus femur . All bone graft harvest obtain use single pas ream guide wire place centrally distal femur . Two 750 micrometer filter place series suction end RIA . The first filter collect bone , second filter fill Beta-Tricalcium Phosphate . Three sample ( &lt; 1 cc ) bone collect first filter . The first sample top filter , second sample obtain halfway filter , final sample obtain bottom filter . Similarly , three sample Beta-Tricalcium Phosphate obtain second filter . Each sample also less 1 cc material . The first sample top layer , second sample middle Beta-Tricalcium Phosphate layer , final sample bottom filter . The middle filter layer determine measure filter sample ruler divide two . Each sample store dry ice transport Department Surgery laboratory run Dr. Irshad Chaudry processing described . We also obtain single sample fluid effluent normally discard part procedure . That sample analyzed protein factor describe . All patient undergo needle biopsy ipsilateral iliac crest general anesthesia surgical procedure . The bone biopsy take surgical incision use place reamer irrigator aspirator case . If patient require small incision place reamer , preclude needle biopsy surgical incision , needle biopsy occur small ( &lt; 1 cm ) incision directly iliac crest . The iliac crest biopsy also immediately place dry ice transport Department Surgery laboratories Dr. Chaudry evaluation . After sample obtain , schedule surgical procedure complete .</detailed_description>
