	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine infectious disease may associate new lymphoma diagnosis . Infections test include : 1 . Helicobacter pylorus ( H. pylorus ) : This bacteria sometimes find stomach associate particular kind lymphoma , gastric MALT . We interest learn H. pylorus infection may associate indolent lymphoma . 2 . Hepatitis C : This virus infection liver find association non-follicular lymphoma Italy . We want determine infection associate lymphomas United States . 3 . Bacterial overgrowth small bowel : Since indolent lymphoma often affect lymph node surround small bowel , may possible infection within bowel stimulate lymphoma growth . This never demonstrate date , study clinical study . 4 . Epstein-Barr virus : This virus cause infectious mononucleosis `` mono . '' It associate rapidly grow lymphoma , indolent lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Study Possible Infectious Disease - Associated Antigen Drive Previously Untreated Indolent Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective observational clinical study possible infectious disease-associated antigen drive previously untreated patient indolent lymphoma ( follicular nonfollicular cohort ) . Eligible patient new diagnosis indolent lymphoma enrol informed consent . All patient test possible know infectious disease may contribute antigen drive ( H. Pylori ; Hepatitis C ) , well infectious disease yet establish contribute antigen drive ( Borrelia ; Chlamydia ; small bowel overgrowth ) . All patient complete history record regard possible chronic infection , infectious disease consultation , indicate . Patients positive antigen-drive infectious disease study treat indicated standard antibiotic regimen response ( infectious disease well lymphoma status ) document record . The primary objective study ( 1 ) evaluate possible association infectious diseases previously untreated patient indolent lymphoma . The secondary objective study evaluate possible lymphoma response patient treat positive infectious disease study ; evaluate EBV immune response previously untreated patient .</detailed_description>
