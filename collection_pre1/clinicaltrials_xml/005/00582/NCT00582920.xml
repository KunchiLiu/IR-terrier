	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine change bone scan treat zoledronic acid ( Zometa™ ) . This study design show intravenous ( IV ) bisphosphonates , infused vein , pamidronate ( Aredia™ ) zoledronic acid ( Zometa™ ) , cause change result bone scan woman metastatic breast cancer . Both bone scan IV bisphosphonates component routine care woman breast cancer spread bone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation Changes Bone Scan Imaging Before After Intravenous Bisphosphonate Therapy Osseous Metastases From Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Presently , intravenous bisphosphonates routinely use every 3 4 week patient osseous metastasis breast cancer . However , data address effect intravenous bisphosphonate therapy result bone scan imaging . Therefore , first step collaboration MSKCC Breast Cancer Medicine Service Nuclear Medicine Service define whether intravenous bisphosphonate therapy affect result bone image standard technetium , Tc-99m MDP . Women receive intravenous bisphosphonate therapy breast cancer metastases involve bone MSKCC eligible diagnostic clinical therapeutic intent study . Bone Scan perform intravenous bisphosphonate therapy ( baseline clinically indicate ) . Ideally , bone scan perform immediately , bisphosphonate therapy . Zoledronic acid , intravenous bisphosphonate therapy ( clinically indicate ) Bone Scan perform within 1 day intravenous bisphosphonate therapy ( study test ) . Number lesion see baseline study test count compare change image result induce intravenous bisphosphonate therapy . The number lesion detect bone scan pre post therapy record difference calculate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients receive intravenous biphosphonate therapy ( zoledronic acid 4 mg renal dose equivalent ) part treatment regimen , diagnose metastatic breast cancer involve surround bone . Patients must prior treatment zoledronic acid ( 4 mg adjust dose renal function ) within 8 week . The patient clinical status assess treat physician must deem appropriate continue treatment zoledronic acid The patient 's clinical status , assess treat physician , must deem appropriate evaluation bone scan The patient 's medical status assess treat physician must medically appropriate receive zoledronic acid within study time frame association study bone scan No evidence bone metastasis , less 3 osseous lesion felt consistent bone metastasis , recent bone scan perform clinical indication prior study entry . Patients illness , condition would prevent understanding nature study comply protocol requirement</criteria>
