	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess effective celecoxib limit production hormone , prostaglandin , subject 's body . It felt hormone involve evolution pre-cancerous growth colon cancerous stage progression exist cancer . To answer question , subject give new investigational drug , subject placebo . A placebo capsule contain inactive ingredient . Only compare response two subject group , one receiving placebo ( inactive ) , one receiving celecoxib ( active ) , able know whether celecoxib actually work . The outcome assess hormone activity celecoxib give .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Surgically Resected Colorectal Adenomas Carcinomas After 7 Days Pretreatment With Celecoxib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose test hypothesis celecoxib , specific inhibitor cyclooxygenase -2 ( COX-2 ) , effectively inhibit enzymatic activity tissue sample oral administration celecoxib 7 day preoperatively . One hundred twenty patient ( 120 ) undergo standard surgical resection treatment primary colorectal adenoma carcinoma would randomize celecoxib placebo give 7 day prior operation . Peripheral blood drawn prior drug placebo administration , morning operation . At time definitive resection specimen , normal intestinal mucosa primary tumor would harvest immediately snap frozen -80 degree . Levels COX-2 activity ( prostaglandin production ) well expression COX-2 marker ( matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , tissue inhibitor MMPs ( TIMPs ) , cell adhesion cell cycle control molecule evaluate normal mucosa primary tumor compare celecoxib placebo treat patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : 1 . Mass suspicious carcinoma , clinical diagnosis adenocarcinoma colon ( histologically confirm upon study entry ) adenoma removable endoscopy . 2 . Patient must undergo colorectal resection 3. age &gt; 18yrs 4 . Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) &gt; 60 . 5 . Signed date informed consent . 6 . Complete history physical examination within 30 day study entry . 7 . Laboratory evaluation within 30 day study entry include : Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) differential platelet , Blood Urea Nitrogen ( BUN ) , creatinine , bilirubin , serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) , serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , alkaline phosphatase , total protein , albumin carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) . 8 . Chest xray within 30 day study entry . 9 . The subject serious medical illness , treat study , would limit ability patient receive protocol therapy , psychiatric condition would prevent informed consent . Absolute exclusion criterion : 1. severe infection ; White Blood Cell Count ( WBC ) &gt; 2 time normal , fever , sepsis ) 2. immunosuppression ( steroid , transplant patient ) 3. emergent operation ( perforation , obstruction ) . 4 . Patients serum bilirubin creatinine level great two time normal upper limit would exclude . 5 . Pregnant lactate woman subject child bear age practice effective mean birth control 6 . Sulfonamide allergy 7 . Recurrent previous history know ischemic heart disease thrombotic event well angioplasty cardiac bypass procedure previous 12 month . Relative exclusion criterion : 1 . Medications take patient list section 9.0 protocol would review enlist physician prior entry study . Warfarin , aspirin methotrexate would stop prior protocol entry stop prior surgery . The common listed medication would ACE inhibitor furosemide . The dose , schedule indication medication would review patient decision regard entry study would make enlist physician . Other less common medication similarly review , however little clinical side effect despite potential biochemical interaction . 2 . Medications know COX inhibitor would stop prior entry study . This would include aspirin , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAID ) ( ibuprofen , naproxen , rofecoxib , celecoxib , Mobic , etc ) counter cold medication might contain substance . A list common overthecounter medication might contain substance review patient question study begin , instruction call take medication give .</criteria>
