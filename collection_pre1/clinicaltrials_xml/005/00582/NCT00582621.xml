	<criteria>Patients lymphoma lymphoproliferative disease Bcell malignancy , multiple myeloma accept referral Cancer Family Clinic Department Human Genetics genetic counseling , MSKCC outpatient clinic Lymphoma , Multiple Myeloma , Leukemia Services Department Medicine consultation treatment find routine history Family History Questionnaire ( FHQ ) ( Appendix A ) relatives member successive generation family affect Hodgkin 's disease , nonHodgkin 's lymphoma , lymphoid leukemia , multiple myeloma lymphoproliferative disease prostate pancreatic cancer . Patients lymphoma , associated colon renal cancer eligible DNA storage protocol . Family member probands Hodgkin 's disease woman receive therapeutic irradiation Hodgkin 's disease '' develop secondary cancer Hodgkin 's disease also eligible participation . The criterion eligibility broad ascertainment computerize FHQ allow resolution different type lymphoma different type leukemia . Patient recall information also imprecise . More accurate family history information obtain upon contact family member diagnosis verify obtain pathologic documentation . The spectrum familial lymphoproliferative syndrome ( LPS ) may include type lymphoma well chronic lymphocytic leukemia . This additional reason broad eligibility . Subset analysis perform specific type lymphoid neoplasms . DNA patient family history lymphoma consent protocol 93102 ( `` Ascertainment Peripheral Blood Saliva Samples Genetic Epidemiology Studies Familial Cancers '' ) also eligible inclusion study . Family member probands include patient , sister , brother , halfbrothers sister , son , daughter , grandparent , well aunt uncle also eligible . An effort make ascertain living affected unaffected living relative affect lineage . An emphasis affect sibling pair parent , alive . Also eligible inclusion 2000 anonymized familial lymphoma/leukemia sample Montefiore Medical Center , information age onset , gender , lymphoma leukemia type , familial relationship , year sample collection . No PHI use therefore sample fully permanently anonymized MSKCC . As study involve research present great minimal risk child ( see Sec . 46.404 Federal Regulations part 46 ) , minor also eligible participation . The assent minor obtain patient enrol study , well consent legal guardian .</criteria>
