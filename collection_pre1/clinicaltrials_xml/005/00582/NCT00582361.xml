	<detailed_description>Soft tissue injury follow open fracture significant problem follow surgical treatment traumatic skeletal injury . The soft tissue injury result combination initiate trauma additional tissue injury surgery . Current treatment include open reduction internal fixation versus external fixation , irrigation debridement follow admission , decrease activity ( non weight bearing status injured extremity ) , maintain patient inpatient hospital , repeat irrigation debridement ( 36-72 hour follow initial trauma ) concomitant wound culture time determine either delayed primary closure , skin graft with/without flap coverage attempt . All patient study treated appropriate empiric antibiotic regimen wound culture result justify modification antibiotic sensitivity/resistance reason . In general , bar patient allergy , empiric antibiotic regimen adhere Gustilo Anderson classification follow : Grade I : Ancef Grade II : Ancef Gentamicin Zosyn Grade III : Ancef , Gentamicin Zosyn , add Penicillin grade IIIB open fracture . All wound assess initially admission follow Gustilo Anderson classification open fracture . Subsequent wound assessment operate room grade accord follow descriptive scale : Type A wound : Abundant granulation tissue , ready closure . Type B Wound : Granulation tissue present inadequate closure , Wound clinically clean appear . Type C Wound : No granulation tissue , gross purulence . Type D Wound : Gross purulence/infected wound , granulation tissue . The outcome variable consist intraoperative postoperative adverse device effect record medical record study data collection form , time wound closure , intraoperative postoperative complication record medical record study data collection form . Clinical photograph wound take digital camera time admission study , subsequent trip operating room ( every 48-72 hour ) . We also record injury severity score multiple trauma patient record time injury medical record study data collection form , soft tissue score accord Gustillo Anderson open injury medical record study data collection form . Baseline serum albumin total lymphocyte count take admission evaluate baseline nutritional immunologic status time injury . All patient Intensive Care Units daily weight , fluid balance , nutritional intake document . Resuscitation data also record trauma room , include fluid , blood , base deficit . The effect measure clinical examination augment culture data wound require surgical intervention . Patients open fracture give inform consent enter study randomize two group . Group A patient treated return operate room approximately 48 hour follow initial trauma , approximately every 48 hour thereafter , irrigation debridement concomitant wound culture ( qualitative quantitative ) time wound judge surgeon ready either delayed primary closure flap/skin graft coverage . Group B patient treat VAC negative pressure device follow initial surgical irrigation debridement . Group B patient return operate room approximately 48 hour follow initial irrigation debridement VAC removal , wound culture ( qualitative quantitative ) , repeat irrigation debridement , wound evaluation surgeon possible delayed closure versus reapplication VAC device . Group B patient also return operate room approximately every 48 hour thereafter irrigation debridement concomitant wound culture ( qualitative quantitative ) wound judge ready coverage closure surgeon .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient sustain open fracture require surgical irrigation debridement . No gross clinical evidence infection . A grossly infected open wound . Infection define clinical sign symptom infection include increase drainage , increase pain , purulent drainage , increase erythema . Any wound think infect cultured confirm diagnosis . A surgical incision cover VAC sponge water impermeable sheet ( Ioban Tegaderm ) achieve close vacuum environment wound . Wounds associated surgical incision intentionally leave open heal either delayed primary closure secondary granulation Abnormal coagulation lead expand hematoma require surgical debridement . Pregnant woman . Inability unwillingness comply protocol . Patients family member unable unwilling sign study inform consent .</criteria>
