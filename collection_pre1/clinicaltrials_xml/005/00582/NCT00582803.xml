	<detailed_description>Women risk hereditary breast cancer recommend undergo intensive surveillance maximize likelihood detect disease early , curable , stage ( Burke et al . 1997 , Eisenger et al . 1998 , Moller et al . 1999 ) . Although particular recommendation different group vary , suggest program incorporate clinical radiographic screening perform frequently general population , begin considerably young age . Recent study demonstrate sensitivity breast MRI lead several group incorporate technology incremental ( replacement ) modality , increase intensity surveillance regimen . While data begin accumulate regard effectiveness aggressive surveillance , little known ability willingness woman adhere rigorous schedule , psychosocial economic cost program . Based upon Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing ( C-SHIP ) model ( Miller , Shoda , Hurley 1996 ) , hypothesize ability adhere propose screen regimen result complex dynamic interaction nature regimen , event expect occur course screening ( abnormal result practical barrier ) key psychological factor individual 's attentional style , affective state , perceive risk cancer , cancer-specific worry , belief regard effectiveness screening . To test hypothesis , propose prospectively study woman hereditary risk breast cancer participate structure surveillance program monthly breast self-examination , semi-annual clinical examination annual mammography , augment annual interval breast MRI .</detailed_description>
