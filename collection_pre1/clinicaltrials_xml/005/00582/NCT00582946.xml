	<brief_summary>Our goal design build new hearing aid system , mitigate common complaint hear aid user . These include hear multi-talker situation , poor sound quality , unwanted whistle result feedback , dislike sound voice . Current effort , limited success , use signal processing method rather restore closely normal auditory function . We plan achieve goal reduce practice three key enable concept . The first replace current acoustic transducer non-acoustic mechanical output transducer directly actuate tympanic membrane ( TM ) . This transducer , call EarLens , float tympanic membrane manner similar way contract lens float eye . The second increase output bandwidth hear aid . The third key concept place wide-bandwidth microphone ear canal capture pinna diffraction cue similarly way normal ear function . Our central hypothesis hearing aid delivers amplify wide-bandwidth mechanical stimulus , directionally dependent cue , open canal configuration perform well conventional hearing aid compete talker background . First phase include verification capability system deliver sufficient maximum equivalent pressure output ( MEPO ) treat degree hearing loss target fitting range .</brief_summary>
