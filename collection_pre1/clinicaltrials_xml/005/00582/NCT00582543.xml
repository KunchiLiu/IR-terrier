	<brief_summary>The purpose study see magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ( MRSI ) tell patient prostate cancer low risk cancer grow spread . Magnetic resonance method use magnet radio wave take picture body structure ( MRI ) measure amount important chemical within body ( MRSI ) . This study look structural chemical property prostates undergoing treatment . Hopefully , doctor able use method make treatment decision patient newly diagnose cancer prostate . This study continue work ass value MRI/MRSI address currently one great clinical challenge management prostate cancer : identification low-risk organ-confined prostate cancer manage expectantly defer treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI/MRSI Risk Assessment Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , patient low-risk , organ-confined prostate cancer identify clinic prior already schedule standard care MRI Department Radiology approach study . Eligible patient undergo baseline eMRI/MRSI exam 6 24 week follow biopsy . Patients undergo definitive treatment ( radical prostatectomy ( RP ) radiation therapy ( RT ) ) place deferred therapy . Predictor variable record patient enrollment , treatment treatment follow-up . Patient outcome-disease progression determine long term clinical follow-up</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Gleason ≤6 ( grade 3 + 3 low ) biopsy proven prostate cancer 2 . Clinically lowrisk localize disease define NCCN guideline ( clinical stage T1T2a , maximum Gleason score 26 , peak serum PSA level &lt; 10 ng/ml ) 3 . No evidence disseminate disease ( bone lymph node metastasis ) 4 . Treatment—radical prostatectomy , radiation therapy , defer therapy—will MSKCC 5 . Willingness undergo serial surveillance TRUSguided prostate biopsy eMRI/MRSI examination MSKCC place deferred therapy protocol 6 . In surgical cohort , RP ( radical prostatectomy ) schedule occur within six month eMRI/MRSI study 1 . Prior treatment ( e.g . hormonal therapy , radical prostatectomy , radiation therapy cryosurgery ) 2 . Inability give inform consent age , general medical psychiatric condition , physiologic status 3 . Presence known contraindication eMRI 4 . Unwillingness inability undergo placement endorectal MR coil ultrasound probe . As case standard MR exam , presence pacemaker aneurysm clip could pose risk patient , make unable eMRI , therefore unable participate study .</criteria>
