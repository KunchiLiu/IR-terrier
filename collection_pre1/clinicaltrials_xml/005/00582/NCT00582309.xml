	<detailed_description>I . RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC AIMS A . Introduction : Increasing evidence observational study hospitalize patient without diabetes indicate hyperglycemia predictor poor outcome . Over short-term , hyperglycemia adversely affect fluid balance ( glycosuria dehydration ) , impair immunologic response infection , promote inflammation endothelial dysfunction . Blood glucose control intensive insulin therapy patient acute critical illness reduces risk multiorgan failure systemic infection , decrease short- long-term mortality . The use intravenous insulin infusion prefer route insulin administration management diabetic subject diabetic ketoacidosis nonketotic hyperosmolar state , intraoperative postoperative care , postoperative period follow heart surgery organ transplantation , acute myocardial infarction , stroke , critical care illness . Some setting may characterize , associate , severe rapidly change insulin requirement , generalize patient edema , impaired perfusion subcutaneous site , requirement pressor support , and/or use total parenteral nutrition . In setting , intravenous route insulin administration consider superior subcutaneous injection split-mixed regimen intermediate regular insulin respect rapidity effect control hyperglycemia , overall ability achieve glycemic control , importantly , prevent hypoglycemic episode . Recently , several insulin infusion protocol report literature . In general , order `` titrate drip '' give achieve target blood glucose range use establish algorithm application mathematical rule nurse staff . These algorithms formula , however , may confuse difficult follow may increase risk dose error . To facilitate patient care , insulin algorithm could place computer use patient bedside direct nursing staff administer intravenous insulin . The Glucommander one computer-derived insulin infusion protocol use successfully 5,802 patient diabetes 1984 1998 . B . Hypotheses : hypothesize management inpatient hyperglycemia computer-guided intravenous infusion protocol ( Glucommander ) facilitate smooth glycemic control lower rate hypoglycemic event treatment follow standard insulin infusion algorithm simple calculated infusion protocol critically ill patient medical surgical ICU . C. Specific Aim : determine difference glycemic control treatment computer-guided intravenous infusion protocol ( Glucommander ) , standard insulin infusion algorithm simple calculated infusion protocol critically ill patient medical surgical ICU . II . BACKGROUND AND CURRENT STATUS OF WORK IN THE FIELD . The result several observational interventional study indicate hyperglycemia associate poor hospital outcome include prolonged hospital stay , infection , disability hospital discharge , death , improvement outcome achieve improved glycemic control patient critical surgical illness . Although still prove mechanism explain detrimental effect hyperglycemia , increase effort worldwide improve maintain strict glycemic control subject critical illness . In 2001 , large prospective , randomize control trial Leuven , show near normalization blood glucose level use intensive insulin protocol improve clinical outcome patient admit surgical intensive care area . In study , insulin administration maintain blood glucose level 80-110 mg/dl , reduce ICU mortality 34 % , reduce risk multiorgan failure , systemic infection , incidence acute renal failure , need blood transfusion prolong mechanical ventilatory support . Interventional study set acute coronary event show intensive insulin therapy result decreased short- long-term mortality . Similarly , attainment target glucose control set cardiac surgery associate reduced mortality significant reduction deep sternal wound infection . Similarly , set acute neurological illness , stroke , head injury extensive observational interventional study indicate hyperglycemia associate increased mortality diminish neurological recovery . Based observational interventional study , aggressive control blood glucose recommend patient critical illness . A recent position statement American Association Clinical Endocrinologists recommend glycemic target hospitalize patient intensive care unit 80 - 110 mg/dL . The American College Endocrinology position statement support follow indication intravenous insulin therapy hospitalize patient diabetes : - Prolonged fasting ( &gt; 12 hour ) type 1 diabetes - Critical illness - Before major surgical procedure - After organ transplantation - Diabetic ketoacidosis - Total parenteral nutrition therapy - Labor delivery - Myocardial infarction - Other illness require prompt glucose control . Institutions around world use variety insulin infusion algorithms implement nursing staff . These algorithms facilitate communication physician nurse , achieve correction hyperglycemia timely manner , provide method determine insulin infusion rate require maintain blood sugar within define target range , include rule make temporary corrective increment decrement insulin infusion rate without under- overcompensation , allow adjustment maintenance rate patient insulin sensitivity carbohydrate intake change . In insulin infusion protocol , order `` titrate drip '' give achieve target blood glucose range use establish algorithm application mathematical rule nurse staff . These algorithm may confuse difficult follow may increase risk error . To facilitate patient care , Drs . Davidson Steed develop Glucommander 1984 , computer base system glycemic control hospitalize patient . This computer-guided insulin infusion system direct administration intravenous insulin response blood glucose measurement patient 's bedside . Prior start insulin infusion , physician must specify follow parameter : low end high end target range blood glucose , initial factor multiplier , maximum time interval blood glucose measurement . During infusion , nurse enters blood glucose level computer recommend insulin infusion rate time check next blood glucose testing . The start insulin infusion follow formula : insulin / hour = multiplier x ( BG - 60 ) . The `` multiplier '' parameter automatically adjust base glucose pattern response insulin . For adult , initial multiplier 0.02 . The Glucommander program adjust multiplier upwards downwards blood glucose level target level . This study compare three method compare glucose regulate IV insulin . The first method use slide scale insulin base glucose draw set interval . The second method use algorithm us glucose draw set interval also much glucose change last time glucose drawn adjust amount insulin give . The algorithm take count fast glucose change also far glucose expect value improve accuracy amount insulin give . The glucocommander handheld base algorithm take fast glucose change far glucose want add another layer tell nurse draw next glucose glucose far away expect value draw glucose short time period help get expect glucose faster . The comparison method reach expect glucose faster often glucose go low . Methods improve way get glucose expect value well patient increase chance hypoglycemia . This study compare three method regulate glucose insulin .</detailed_description>
