	<brief_title>Phase II Study Gamma Knife Radiosurgery Temozolomide Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II study . The primary endpoint proportion patient newly develop metastasis develop new brain metastasis within first year undergo stereotactic radiation combine administration temozolamide within first year post treatment . Retrospective prospective study suggest 50- 60 % long-term survivor develop new brain metastasis . Since important observe patient recruit minimum year measure primary outcome , traditional phase 2 design Simon 's two stage optimal design mini-max design practical case . Survival QOL secondary end point . QOL measure use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy ( FACT -BR ) . It administer baseline , week four every three month 24 month . This protocol include radiosurgery standard radiation dos ( 15-24 Gy base upon RTOG 9005 ) . Patient may register radiosurgery long Temodar start within two week radiosurgery . Beginning within two week radiosurgery : TMZ 200mg/m2 day 1-5 repeat q28 day . Patients receive prior chemotherapy receive 150 mg/m2 day 1-5 . Temozolomide continue disease progression define systemic progression new metastasis . If lesion treat radiosurgery progress absence new CNS tumor systemic progression , TMZ continue . Temozolomide discontinue systemic progression require systemic chemotherapy . Palliative radiation may administer non-CNS site protocol treatment , additional systemic chemotherapy administer patient progress systemically new metastasis develop .</detailed_description>
