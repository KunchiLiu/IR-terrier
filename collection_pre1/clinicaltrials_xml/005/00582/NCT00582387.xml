	<brief_summary>The purpose study see able tell risk bladder cancer reoccur worsen genetics risk factor examine along stage grade tumor . Superficial bladder cancer cancer grow muscle layer bladder wall . Even though superficial cancer , type cancer tend come back treat often aggressive return . We already know , `` stage '' deeply tumor grows bladder wall `` grade '' fast tumor grows affect whether tumor come back get bad time . Now use information stage grade tumor decide treat tumor often check treatment . However , reliable , person unique genetic characteristic factor likely affect happen tumor time . For instance , know risk develop cancer may affect surroundings factor eat , type habit smoking , type job , everyone expose risk factor get cancer . We believe due unique genetic characteristic person may help body fight cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Susceptibility Tumor Recurrence Progression Patients With Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This hospital base cohort study subject diagnose within twelve month nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer evaluate determine whether candidate genetic variant associate risk recurrence progression . Known tumor variable stratify correlated marker . The long term goal estimate predict risk recurrence progression well enough modify surveillance schedule . Since 40 % superficial bladder cancer patient never recur progress , individual could return less frequently followup , save cost discomfort . All patient receive usual care follow determine rate recurrence progression disease . Each subject donate 30 ml blood extraction genomic DNA isolation lymphocytes assess DNA damage/repair function . In addition , subject undergoes transurethral resection bladder ( TURB ) and/or random bladder biopsy part his/her usual care donate urothelial cell random bladder biopsy analyse DNA damage/repair function . The DNA repair capacity lymphocytes correlate normal bladder tissue evaluate use lymphocytes surrogate marker . When bladder biopsy tissue available , urothelial cell obtain cystoscopic catheterize bladder lavage .</detailed_description>
