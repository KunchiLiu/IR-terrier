	<brief_summary>The purpose study test new technology obtain x-ray image treatment field position treatment machine , determine whether new system reliable easy use conventional systems.. These so-called portal image normally take weekly basis , prior radiation treatment . The new portal imaging system test design produce good quality image currently achievable , additional dose add treatment time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Cone Beam Imaging Radiation Therapy Treatment Verification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective proposal test clinical practicality new technology ; cone beam imaging , verification treatment set accuracy cancer patient receive radiation therapy . Currently , treatment accuracy check via use 2-dimensional projection x-ray take megavoltage treatment beam electronic portal image device ( EPID ) . Typically 2 orthogonal portal image obtain confirm patient position accuracy . This method treatment verification , however , usually provide image poor quality lack true 3D information , thus make difficult radiation oncologist definitively confirm treatment accuracy . New generation EPIDs capable obtain high quality image significantly low imaging dos . Thus , total image dose new generation EPIDs permit acquisition many projection image rather 2 3 . The combination image high quality image permit definitive assessment treatment accuracy . We propose test clinical practicality reliability new prototype portal imaging system .</detailed_description>
