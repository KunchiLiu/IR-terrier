	<brief_summary>4 . Methods 4a . Overview The study conduct participant African-American Study Kidney Disease ( AASK ) Cohort study randomize three period cross-over trial . Eighty five percent AASK cohort participant currently ACE inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker ; commonly use ACE inhibitor ramipril . The new strategy propose pilot study remain ramipril-based , maintain overall blood pressure control achieve thus far . The antihypertensive regimen propose follow : - AM dose ramipril daily medication participant antihypertensive regimen ( term USUAL ) , - Bedtime dose ramipril day medication participant 's antihypertensive regimen ( term HS-DOSING ) , - current antihypertensive regimen plus additional antihypertensive agent dose bed time ; choice additional agent tailor base prespecified clinical guideline ( term ADD-ON DOSING ) The `` usual arm '' serf comparator arm . The `` h dosing '' `` add-on dosing '' arm test practical strategy could test subsequent clinical outcome trial could implement clinical practice . We hypothesize arm reduce nocturnal BP comparison `` usual dosing '' . We hypothesize `` hs dosing '' arm raise daytime BP somewhat net effect 24 hour BP `` add dose '' arm effect daytime BP low 24 hour BP . This pilot study begin last scheduled AASK Cohort study visit . Eligible participant treat 6 week 3 antihypertensive regimen . The sequence regimens random . Each period three period 2 visit , one visit 3 week one visit 6 week . In last week 6-week period , 24-hour ABPM obtain . The primary outcome variable nocturnal BP ; pair wise difference regimen calculate .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participant AASK Cohort Study Ability willingness provide inform consent Completion technically adequate ABPM CO48 AASK cohort study visit . Participants must least 2 visit last 12 month Cohort Study ( July 1 2006 June 1 2007 ) The average last two BPs measure least one week apart Cohort Study must less equal 140/90 mm Hg . This would exclude small percentage AASK cohort population ; however , would enroll group participant stable BP require adjustment antihypertensive medication course study . Antihypertensive medication baseline visit : This refer participant 's antihypertensive regimen time baseline visit ; transition period may use adjust participant 's antihypertensive regimen meet criterion , base clinical judgement site investigator . Arm circumference great 50 cm . ESRD require renal replacement therapy kidney transplantation Institutionalized participant Shift worker work night MI CVA within 3 month AASK Cohort close visit Participants know ejection fraction le 40 % Females know pregnant lactating Participants likely reach end stage renal disease within next six week , judgement site investigator</criteria>
