	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer 5th lead cause cancer mortality United States , 5 year mortality rate 95 % . With limited treatment available cure prolongation survival , quality life issue , optimal treatment understand depression , become important focus care population . Clinical Depression ( Major Depressive Syndrome ) occur 50 % patient pancreatic cancer , significantly common cancer . Accumulating evidence suggest potential role endogenous cytokine , specifically interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) development depression medically ill , include cancer patient . These cytokine note elevated pancreas cancer patient . The main goal pilot study examine role specific endogenous cytokine ( IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF-alpha , well IL-10 , Il-15 IFN-gamma ) development Major Depressive Syndrome ( MDS ) patient pancreatic cancer . To achieve goal , examine relationship serum cytokine ( IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF-alpha , well IL-10 , Il-15 IFN-gamma ) clinical depression ( i.e . MDS ) utilize cross sectional design 4 sample patient : ) Pancreas cancer patient DSM-IV diagnosis MDS ( N=25 ) ; b ) Pancreas cancer patient without DSM-IV diagnosis MDS ( N=25 ) ; c ) Healthy Controls DSM-IV diagnosis MDS ( N=25 ) ; ) Healthy Controls without DSM-IV diagnosis MDS ( N=25 ) . Measures include structural clinical interview DSM-IV diagnosis ( SCID ) Major Depressive Syndrome , well measure depressive symptom severity , fatigue severity , concentration attention , cognitive function . Plasma concentration endogenous cytokine ( ( IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF-alpha , well IL-10 , Il-15 IFN-gamma ) measure utilizing standard assay . Our specific aim : 1 ) To preliminarily examine relationship plasma concentration endogenous cytokine ( IL-1 , Il-6 , TNF-alpha , well IL-10 , Il-15 IFNgamma ) DSM-IV diagnosis Major Depressive Syndrome patient pancreas cancer healthy control ; 2 ) To explore relationship plasma concentration endogenous cytokine ( Il-1 , Il-6 , TNF-alpha , well IL-10 , Il-15 IFN-gamma ) phenomenology severity depressive symptom , presence severity fatigue , degree impairment attention , concentration cognition , depress patient pancreas cancer healthy depress control . The result pilot study utilized seek NIH funding large , longitudinal , multi-institutional , study examine role endogenous cytokine pancreas cancer patient , well clinical intervention trial treatment clinical depression pancreas cancer patient utilize specific cytokine antagonist adjuncts antidepressant drug therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . 40 year age old time recruitment . 2 . Unresectable/inoperable pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( stage III IV ) , receive Gemcitabine Gemcitabinebased combination therapy . 3 . If `` depressed '' sample , patient pancreatic cancer must meet DSMIV criterion major depressive syndrome ( base SCID ) AND HDRS score 18 great . 4 . If `` nondepressed '' sample , patient pancreatic cancer must meet DSMIV criterion major depressive syndrome ( base SCID ) AND must HDRS score 17 less . 1 . A . Patient report experience medical record indicate serious medical event ( i.e. , medical hospitalization ( exclude hospitalization relate cancer diagnosis/treatment ) , myocardial infarction , stroke ) within year precede study participation . B . Patient report presence medical record indicate : Type 1 Diabetes , unrelated cancer diagnosis renal failure require dialysis inflammatory bowel disease 3 . Patient report presence medical record indicate active secondary cancer diagnosis , however patient treat past cancer 2 year disease free cancer participate . 4 . Presence medical/surgical condition obtain selfreport associate elevated cytokine level , : HIV/AIDS Autoimmune diseases SLE , Multiple Sclerosis , Rheumatoid Arthritis , Polymyalgia Rheumatica , Temporal Arteritis , Chronic Fatigue Syndrome , severe allergy Congestive Heart Failure Recent stroke Alzheimer 's Disease Active infection ; Acute pancreatitis Acute pericarditis Acute hepatitis include Hepatitis C Recent vaccination viral disease Major surgery within past 6 week 5 . Patient Reports Receiving treatment ( within two week ) : Interleukin Interferon Thalidomide NSAID 's Cox2 inhibitor Cancer vaccine therapies 6 . Selfreported diagnosis major psychiatric disorder depression ( e.g . psychosis secondary Bipolar Disorder , Schizophrenia , Schizoaffective illness , substance abuse ) severe , opinion study staff , would interfere patient 's ability give inform consent research . 7 . Cognitive impairment severe , opinion study staff , would interfere patient 's ability give inform consent complete study measure research .</criteria>
