	<brief_title>Vacuum Assisted Closure Treatment Soft Tissue Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients calcaneus fracture require open reduction internal fixation lateral approach give inform consent enter study randomize two group . Randomization stratify three fracture type . Group A patient treated daily dress change wound evaluation begin post operative day 1 . Group B patient VAC device place operating room , first post-operative wound evaluation take place 48 hour post-op . If first post-operative evaluation mark drainage , VAC device replace re-evaluation approximately 48 hour later . The outcome variable consist number day amount wound drainage , incidence wind breakdown , incidence flap coverage , incidence infection , return operate room repeat irrigation debridement , need repeat wound closure , intraoperative postoperative complication record medical record study data collection form . Patients tibial plateau fracture require open reduction internal fixation give inform consent enter study randomize two group . Group A patient treated daily dress change wound evaluation begin post operative day 2 . Group B patient VAC device place operating room , first post-operative wound evaluation take place 48 hour post-op . If first post-operative evaluation mark drainage VAC device replace re-evaluation approximately 48 hour later . Patients open tibial plateau fracture include group A B sub-stratified within group . The outcome variable consist number day amount wound drainage , incidence wind breakdown , incidence flap coverage , incidence infection , return operate room repeat irrigation debridement , need repeat wound closure , intraoperative postoperative complication record medical record study data collection form . Patients pilon fracture require open reduction internal fixation give inform consent enter study randomize two group . Group A patient treated daily dress change wound evaluation begin post operative day 2 . Group B patient VAC device place operating room , first post-operative wound evaluation take place 48 hour post-op . If first post-operative evaluation mark drainage VAC device replace re-evaluation approximately 48 hour later . Patients open pilon fracture include group A B sub-stratified within group . The outcome variable consist number day amount wound drainage , incidence wound dehiscence , incidence flap coverage , incidence infection , return operate room repeat irrigation debridement , need repeat wound closure , intraoperative postoperative complication record medical record study data collection form . All patient total lymphocyte count albumin level record admission document nutritional status ability heal wound . Clinical photograph wound take digital camera time admission study , subsequent trip operating room . We also record injury severity score multiple trauma patient record time injury medical record study data collection form . The soft tissue score , accord Tscherne classification close injury accord Gustillo Anderson classification open injury also record , multiple trauma patient , time injury medical record study data collection form . The effect measure clinical examination augment culture data wound require surgical intervention . All patient Intensive Care Units daily weight , fluid balance , nutritional intake record per ICU protocol . Resuscitation data , include total fluid , blood product , base deficit record . Fluids blood utilization OR also document . The following method tool use document study data point : intraoperative postoperative adverse device effect record medical record study data collection form , daily wound drainage document round medical record , admission total lymphocyte count serum albumin level , clinical evidence infection supplementary lab data . All data document study data collection form . Patients follow clinically 12 month , document complication occur wound ( infection , dehiscence , etcâ€¦ ) study data collection form . The soft tissue score accord Tscherne classification close injury , Gustillo Anderson score open injury , record medical record study data collection form . Data collect entered EXCEL spreadsheet double key quality control purpose manage Department Orthopaedic Surgery University Alabama Birmingham ( UAB ) . After data entry complete , file ( ) copy diskette deliver UAB Biostatistics statistician analysis report generation . The analysis involve simple descriptive statistic ( mean , standard deviation , proportion ) assure balance treatment group respect relevant variable . T-test used compare mean time wound closure well need surgical debridement wound . Analysis covariance perform variable require adjustment . Growth curve analysis ( survival model ) Cox regression procedure use compare rate wind closure two group . Assumption proportional hazard model verify attempt Cox regression procedure . P-values compute use Mann-Whitney U test non-parametric data .</detailed_description>
