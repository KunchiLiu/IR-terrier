	<brief_summary>Subjects participate protocol participate three phase : 1 ) pre-admission , 2 ) inpatient admission , 3 ) follow-up . Pre-admission involve screen ( detailed inclusion/exclusion criterion section ) one week outpatient sleep activity monitoring . Inpatient admission 16 consecutive night Clinical Neuroscience Research Unit involve subjective objective test sleep , sleepiness , attention , learn . During inpatient admission subject take modafinil placebo . For follow-up , subject return CNRU one night participate objective test sleep , sleepiness , attention , learn . We hypothesize modafinil decrease subject objective measure sleepiness promote attention learn cocaine dependent person .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A relatively new treatment excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) associate inadequate sleep drug modafinil . Modafinil decrease subjective report objective measure daytime sleepiness condition sleep restriction , enhance cognitive performance . At time , sleep quality appear affect significantly . Interestingly , recent clinical trial cocaine-dependent population suggest modafinil reduces relapse cocaine use , unknown mechanism . We propose employ subjective objective measure nocturnal sleep daytime sleepiness , well measure general cognitive performance sleep-dependent memory consolidation , explore potential mechanistic relationship cocaine abstinence , EDS , modafinil 's efficacy prevent cocaine relapse . The follow specific aim propose : Specific Aim 1 : To establish whether objective measure poor nocturnal sleep ( e.g. , reduce total sleep time sleep efficiency ) progressively characterize period sustain cocaine abstinence also associate objective evidence excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) . Specific Aim 2 : To establish ability modafinil reverse excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) deficit cognitive performance characterize cocaine abstinence . Specific Aim 3 : To conduct pilot study determine whether observed abnormality objective sleep , EDS , and/or cognitive function predict relapse cocaine use and/or whether successful abstinence cocaine associate normalization .</detailed_description>
