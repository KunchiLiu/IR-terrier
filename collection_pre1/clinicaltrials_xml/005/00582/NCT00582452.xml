	<brief_title>Attitudes Towards Prophylactic Colectomy Hereditary Non-polyposis Colorectal Cancer ( HNPCC ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC ) associate 80 % lifetime risk develop colorectal cancer 40-50 % chance metachronous tumor partial colectomy disease . For patient , prophylactic colectomy propose potential risk management alternative lifetime intensive surveillance colonoscopy . The highly personal nature risk management decision recognize development individualize genetic counseling service . However , prior psychosocial research area tend use linear statistical technique clinically important detail lose overly broad , one size-fits-all model difficult apply one-to-one counseling session . We propose innovative approach base Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing ( C-SHIP ) model explore attitude towards prophylactic colectomy organize meaningful pattern type translate readily tailor counseling recommendation . Specific aim study : 1 ) ass level intention prophylactic colectomy among HNPCC patient ; 2 ) To identify distinctive decision type base profile perceive pros con prophylactic colectomy ; 3 ) To explore pattern relation decision type counseling-related outcome ( level intention colectomy , cancer-specific anxiety , colonoscopy adherence ) . We conduct one-time cross-sectional telephone survey 320 HNPCC patient ( define either carrier mutate mismatch repair gene associate HNPCC personal/family history meeting publish criterion HNPCC ) . Using cluster analysis create taxonomy decision type . Prior research lead u expect least three type : Disengaged , Risk-Focused , Ambivalent . We hypothesize type different pattern relation outcome variable ( e.g. , Risk-focused type show high level intention regard surgery , high anxiety , low avoidance , high colonoscopy adherence , whereas Ambivalent type show high level intention regard surgery , high anxiety , high avoidance , low colonoscopy adherence ) . Understanding pattern enhance ability physician , genetic counselor , provider help patient make well inform , thoughtful decision preventive strategy best protect health , emotional well-being , quality life .</detailed_description>
