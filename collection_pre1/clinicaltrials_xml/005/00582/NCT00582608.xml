	<brief_summary>The purpose study find whether monoclonal antibody 8H9 useful find tumor body . Antibodies protein find naturally blood . They fasten bacteria virus . They stimulate white cell blood protein kill tumor . The antibody 8H9 make mouse white cell . The white cell secrete antibody make live ever . They manufacture large amount 8H9 patient use . Although monoclonal antibody safely tested people , antibody 8H9 never give human patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tumor Detection Using Iodine-131-Labeled Monoclonal Antibody 8H9</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To test intravenous injection iodine-131 labeled murine monoclonal antibody 8H9 detect primary metastatic solid tumor . A total 60 patient accrued period 2 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis pediatric/adolescent solid tumor ( include neuroblastoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , Ewing's/PNET , osteosarcoma , brain tumor , desmoplastic small round cell tumor ( DSRT ) tumor 8H9positive ) confirm MSKCC Department Pathology . Patient must either recurrent disease &lt; 20 % chance long term diseasefree survival . Patient must least 1 year old . Age range 150 year age . Patients measurable evaluable disease . For tumor type know 8H9positive , patient image diagnosis make , prior definitive surgery surgery confirm tumor recurrence . Tumor tissue available 8H9 immunostaining . For patient tumortypes know 8H9positive , surgical sample obtain 131I 8H9 imaging immunostained confirm 8H9reactivity . These tumor type include : neuroblastoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , osteosarcoma , DSRT , Ewing 's Sarcoma/PNET ) , brain tumor ( glioblastoma multiforme , mixed glioma , astrocytoma , ependymoma , medulloblastoma , schwannoma. , meningioma ) . If frozen tumor tissue unavailable , bone marrow involvement demonstrate histology , 8H9 immunostaining immunofluorescence carry patient 's bone marrow . In case , patient eligible study bone marrow 8H9 immunostaining positive . Severe major organ toxicity . Specifically , renal , cardiac , hepatic , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , neurologic system toxicity less grade 2 . Patients stable neurological deficit ( brain tumor ) exclude . Patients &lt; = 3 hearing loss exclude . Clinically apparent infection . History allergy iodine mouse protein . Patients previously treat mouse monoclonal antibody eligible unless circulate HAMA . Pregnant woman exclude fear danger fetus . Therefore negative pregnancy test require woman childbearing age , appropriate contraception use study period . Patient 's tumor negative 8H9 immunostaining .</criteria>
