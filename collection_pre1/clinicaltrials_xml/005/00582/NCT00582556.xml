	<brief_summary>The purpose research determine effect time Zometa® administration bone mineral density lumbar spine femoral neck men undergo androgen deprivation therapy prostate adenocarcinoma . In addition , researcher also determine effect treatment Zometa® peripheral blood marker bone turnover , peripheral blood gd T-cell frequency function , determine treatment elicit prostate antigen-specific IgG immune response . The effect treatment serial serum PSA measurement also examine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zometa Bone Mineral Density Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Androgen Ablation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Castration GnRH agonist therapy without androgen antagonist mainstay advanced prostate cancer . One significant side effect use androgen ablative therapy decrease bone mineral density , potentially place patient great risk osteoporosis bone fracture . It prudent anticipate adverse effect therapy minimize severity appropriate timely pharmacologic intervention . Zometa bisphosphonates bisphosphonates effective inhibitor osteoclastic bone resorption . Recent study show bisphosphonates able reduce bone loss observe 24 48 week treatment GnRH analogue . An unanswered question remain , however , frequently agents employed clinical practice . This three-arm randomized trial Zometa® bone mineral density subject stage D prostate cancer undergo androgen ablation therapy . If subject enrol Arm 1 , GnRH analogue would administer every 3 month 1 year . Four milligram Zometa® would administer IV 15 minute 7 day prior begin androgen deprivation therapy . If subject enrol Arm 2 , GnRH analogue would administer every 3 month one year , 4 mg Zometa® would administer IV 15 minute month 6 . If subject enrol Arm 3 , GnRH analogue administer every 3 month 1 year , 4 mg Zometa® administer IV 15 minute monthly 6 month , begin month 6 .</detailed_description>
