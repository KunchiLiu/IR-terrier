	<criteria>Patient/Relative Cohort : Must meet one criterion : 1 . A person diagnosis gastric gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) adenocarcinoma confirm treating institution . 2 . A person without gastric GEJ adenocarcinoma first degree relative eligible High Risk Genetic subgroup ( EOGC/FGC ) . 1 . Early Onset Gastric Cancer diagnosis gastric cancer age 50 without family history disease . 2 . Familial Gastric Cancer family history gastric cancer define one first degree relative 2 second degree relative . 3 . A person without gastric GEJ adenocarcinoma personal family history genetic mutation associate development gastric GEJ adenocarcinoma ( i.e . family history CDH1 mutation ) . II . Must willing provide blood sample germline DNA . These individual sign `` Patient/Relative Consent '' . Following enrollment , assign individual appropriate High Genetic Risk Low Genetic Risk group base age diagnosis family history .
