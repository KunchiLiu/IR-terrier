	<brief_summary>We undertake study patient gastric pancreatic cancer . A common place cancer return surgery gastric pancreatic cancer inside line abdomen , call `` peritoneal metastasis '' . At time surgery , wash abdomen mild salt solution may reveal free cancer cell abdomen could develop peritoneal metastasis . Recently , surgeon Memorial Sloan-Kettering find patient cell develop peritoneal metastasis well treat chemotherapy rather surgery . Sometimes , though , cell might present find use current technique . We try figure well way find free cancer cell . This could improve treatment patient gastric pancreatic cancer . We need `` negative control '' population compare peritoneal washing cancer patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Positive peritoneal cytology predictor poor outcome gastric cancer . These patient generally prognosis similar patient clinically radiologically classified Stage IV disease . Similar , although few , observation make patient pancreatic cancer . If identify prior schedule resection , extensive operation may require . The purpose pilot trial investigate ability quantitative RT-PCR assay detect cancer cell peritoneal washing patient undergo laparoscopy gastric pancreatic cancer . This assay may detect mRNA overly express gastric pancreatic cancer patient malignant cell peritoneum detect less sensitive mean . Results assay compare cytology result , detected standard Papanicolaou staining , routine laparoscopic peritoneal washing absence visible M1 disease . We anticipate enrol 50 gastric cancer patient 50 pancreatic cancer patient undergo laparoscopy part initial management . We plan enroll 30 patient undergoing laparoscopy presume benign condition ( e.g. , gallstone , prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy [ BSO ] ) negative control . We estimate accrual take approximately 12 month . Once assay establish pilot study , plan evaluate prospectively incidence , predictor , clinical significance positive cytology , detect standard Papanicolaou stainingand RT-PCR tumor marker . This study conflict exist protocol Memorial Hospital .</detailed_description>
