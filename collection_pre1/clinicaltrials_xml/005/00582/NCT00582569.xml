	<brief_summary>The purpose new image method provide physicians additional information available standard image method . This include information make different breast disease . Using spectroscopy data , may possible tell difference benign condition breast malignant tumor provide accurate information obtain regular MRI . Along MRI new method evaluate image picture use . This new method call spectroscopy use routinely part body prostate brain . Pictures produce sequence look different regular MRI picture . Performing spectroscopy 1.5T magnet add another imaging sequence ( another scan ) routine MRI protocol , thus increase exam time ( extra 10-15 minute ) . This study enroll patient schedule Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) examination order primary physician .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our aim perform MR Spectroscopy ( MRS ) 150 patient end clinically indicate routine breast MRI guide biopsy breast MRI guide needle localization examination use software package General Electric Medical Systems ( Milwaukee , WI ) . This add time routine examination involve additional injection contrast . We analyze spectroscopic data determine benign lesion reliably differentiate malignant one . The MR Spectroscopy ( MRS ) administer Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , 1275 York Ave , NY , NY 10021 .</detailed_description>
