	<brief_summary>Familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) genetic disease result recurrent attack fever , abdominal pain , chest pain , arthritis rash . There 5-15 % patient continue FMF attack despite treatment colchicine tolerate colchicine . Currently alternative colchicine . Pyrin , protein defect FMF important role regulation molecule call interleukin ( IL ) -1 beta production activity . This molecule important process inflammation FMF . Therefore propose use IL-1 Trap ( Rilonacept ) , medication bind neutralizes IL-1 . We enroll study 17 subject age 4 year , include adult active FMF despite colchicine therapy . Subjects receive random order two 3-month course Rilonacept 2.2 mg/kg ( maximum 160 mg ) weekly subcutaneous injection two 3-month course placebo injection . If patient least two FMF attack treatment course able get choose treatment end treatment course . Our hypothesis Rilonacept decrease number acute FMF attack safe use . This study may confirm importance IL-1 cause FMF . Funding source - FDA Office Orphan Products Development</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) autosomal recessive autoinflammatory genetic disorder result recurrent attack fever , serositis , arthritis rash . Late complication untreated FMF include development renal amyloidosis . FMF rare orphan disease United States . Treatment colchicine effective reducing frequency episodes patient development amyloidosis nearly patient . However , still 5-15 % patient continue acute FMF attack despite colchicine therapy intolerant colchicine , usually gastrointestinal adverse effect . Currently effective alternative colchicine . Pyrin , mutate protein FMF important role regulation IL-1 beta production activity . Mutations pyrin result increase IL-1 beta level mice human . IL-1 beta important pro-inflammatory cytokine . Thus , hypothesize inhibition IL-1 decrease acute attack patient FMF . We propose use IL-1 Trap ( Rilonacept ) , fusion protein consist human IL-1 cytokine receptor extracellular domain FC portion human IgG1 bind neutralizes IL-1 . We enroll 17 subject age 4 year , include adult , multiple center United States active FMF ( least 1 attack per month ) despite receive least 1.2-1.5 mg/d colchicine ( dose dependent age ) intolerant colchicine . Subjects diagnose clinical criterion least one heterozygote mutation MEFV ( pyrin ) gene . After screen subject monitor month observe acute FMF attack develop attack month develop two attack . We use single-subject alternating treatment design subject receive random order two 3-month course Rilonacept 2.2 mg/kg ( max 160 mg ) weekly SC injection two 3-month course comparable volume placebo . Subjects continue usual colchicine dose start study . Subjects 2 acute FMF attack treatment course able crossover treatment arm end treatment course . There 10 study visit : 1 . Screening . 2 . Treatment baseline one month subject develop FMF attack describe . After 1 month treatment course end treatment course ( overall 8 visit ) . At visit subject return complete diary form , use unused drug , queried adverse effect , undergo physical examination laboratory test obtain inflammation , safety visit translational study . Subjects also fill quality life questionnaire give overall estimation disease activity . Results analyze traditional frequency statistic ( use intent treat analysis ) Bayesian hierarchical modeling . Our primary aim ass efficacy Rilonacept decrease number acute FMF attack monitor drug safety . The significance study include short long-term benefit . Fewer FMF attack result less functional impairment high quality life colchicine resistant intolerant patient . Once weekly injection potential improve treatment compliance . Fewer acute attack arthritis may prevent development chronic joint damage . In long-term , good FMF control may prevent amyloidosis . This study may confirm importance IL-1 pathogenesis FMF provide support FDA filing use Rilonacept FMF . The study design may serve template trial new biologic drug rare disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject definitive diagnosis FMF TelHashomer clinical criterion ( long version criterion ) least one mutation one MEFV gene allele . However , subject isolate heterozygous mutation exon 2 MEFV gene ( include E148Q ) eligible . Subject must estimate mean least one acute FMF attack per month month screen . Subject least four year age ( upper limit age ) . Subjects must receive adequate trial colchicine define treatment least 1.5 mg/d least 3 month â‰¥6 year old 1.2 mg/d less 6 year , inability tolerate colchicine due adverse effect dose control acute attack frequency le one attack per month . If subject treat anakinra time consent , washout must do ( 3 day ) . Subject must experience 2 attack randomization visit occur . If subject treat previously antiTNF drug , appropriate washout must do . Etanercept must discontinue 4 week prior randomization ; Adalimumab Infliximab must discontinue 8 week prior randomization . If subject female childbearing potential , must agree use adequate contraception ( adequate contraception include abstinence ) duration trial 3 month must negative serum urine pregnancy test prior administration study medication . If subject male reach puberty , must agree use adequate contraception abstinence study 3 month discontinuation study . Subject 's parent legal guardian provide write informed consent prior screen study subject old 18 year provide informed consent him/herself . Subject , applicable , assented participate prior screen study . Subject , applicable , parent/legal guardian , agree comply study requirement able come clinic require study visit . The subject exist biopsy proven amyloidosis proteinuria &gt; 0.5 gram per day . The subject another active inflammatory rheumatic disease . The subject active malignancy type , history malignancy . The subject active GI disease ( e.g. , inflammatory bowel disease ) , chronic acute renal hepatic disorder , significant coagulation defect . The subject AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) BUN &gt; 2 x ULN creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL laboratory abnormality consider examine physician clinically significant within 28 day Baseline visit . Current use antitumor necrosis factor drug . The subject , investigator 's opinion , chronic condition ( e.g. , diabetes , epilepsy ) either stable wellcontrolled may interfere conduct study . The subject receive investigational medication within 30 day first dose study medication schedule receive investigational drug , study medication describe protocol , course study . The subject chronic active infection major episode infection require hospitalization treatment i.v . antibiotic within 30 day oral antibiotic within 14 day prior screen evaluation . The subject know positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) status . The subject know past current hepatitis . The subject receive live virus vaccine within 1 month prior baseline visit . The subject positive PPD test . The subject sexually active practice effective birth control . The subject pregnant breast feeding child . Any concurrent medical condition would , investigator 's opinion , compromise subject 's ability tolerate study drug would make subject unable cooperate protocol . History of/or current psychiatric illness would interfere ability comply protocol requirement give informed consent . Subject history alcohol drug abuse within past 6 month would interfere ability comply protocol requirement . Inability comply study requirement reason .</criteria>
