	<brief_summary>Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) mix connective tissue disease ( MCTD ) long-term autoimmune disease immune system attack part body . The abnormal immune reaction cause inflammation damage various body part affect joint , skin , kidney , heart , lung , blood vessel , brain . SLE MCTD often affect young woman , especially black Hispanic woman , know cure . Knowing SLE MCTD help develop new effective treatment . The purpose study characterize immune system abnormality , genetic component , disease progression people SLE MCTD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) autoimmune disease immune system produce antibodies body 's healthy cell tissue . These antibody , call autoantibody , contribute inflammation various part body cause damage organ tissue . Mixed connective tissue disease ( MCTD ) another autoimmune disease overlap term sign symptom three connective tissue disease , include SLE . In SLE MCTD , immune system appear abnormally activate small nuclear ribonucleoprotein ( snRNP ) autoantigens . Furthermore , lung tissue , particular , appear affected immune response induce snRNP autoantigens . The cause SLE MCTD remain unknown . However , likely combination genetic , environmental , possibly hormonal factor work together cause disease . Past study suggest several different gene may involve determine person 's likelihood develop SLE MCTD , tissue organ affect , severity disease . The purpose study characterize immune system abnormality , genetic component , disease progression people SLE MCTD . Participants attend four study visit , interval least 3 month , course study . Each study visit include questionnaire , physical exam , possibly blood and/or urine collection . At end study period , participant may choose continue discontinue participation .</detailed_description>
