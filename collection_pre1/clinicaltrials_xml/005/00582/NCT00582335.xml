	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer one significant cause cancer morbidity mortality United States . In 1997 , approximately 130,000 men woman diagnose colorectal cancer ( fourth common cancer site ) approximately 55,000 die disease ( second common cause cancer death ) ; ( Cancer Facts &amp; Figures , 1997 ) . Genetic factor clearly contribute etiology colorectal cancer . Because evidence suggest genetically determine susceptibility colorectal cancer exist proportion newly diagnose case year , conduct study identify new gene associate increased susceptibility familial colorectal cancer analysis family cluster colorectal cancer .</detailed_description>
