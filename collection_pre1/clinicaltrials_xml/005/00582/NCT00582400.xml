	<brief_summary>The purpose study : evaluate safety activity administer arsenic trioxide ( Trisenox ) treatment unresectable metastatic primary liver cancer , evaluate qualitative quantitative toxicity treatment , measure response treatment pattern failure survival . The primary response measurement achievement objective tumor response , response duration progression-free survival</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Protocol Arsenic Trioxide ( Trisenox ) Subjects With Advanced Primary Carcinoma Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one frequently diagnose malignancy region world , particularly Africa Asian portion Pacific rim . However , uncommon malignancy United States , less 14,000 case diagnose annually . Malignancies gallbladder biliary tree also uncommon . As solid tumor , unless either neoplasm resect completely , prognosis grim . A variety agent utilized therapy HCC cholangiocarcinoma , single agent combination regimen . However , despite response rate exceed 50 % hepatic arterial therapy utilized HCC , response rate cholangiocarcinoma systemic treatment HCC considerably low . Long term survival remain uncommon . For reason , new therapeutic approach must evaluate . Trisenox ( arsenic trioxide ) newly-approved pharmaceutical grade arsenic compound antineoplastic agent demonstrate clear activity anthracycline- all-trans retinoic acid-resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia . Trisenox also US Compendium list acute leukemia , chronic myelogenous lymphocytic leukemia , myelodysplasia , multiple myeloma , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . Similar taxanes vinca alkaloid , Trisenox appear interfere microtubule function , trigger cell differentiation , induces program death , apoptosis . The mechanism unclear , appear involve activation caspase down-regulation BCL-2 oncogene . Trisenox also interfere function NF-kappaB , lead inhibition cellular proliferative signal , apoptosis , inhibition tumor angiogenesis . Trisenox show effective pivotal trial consist 40 subject , age 5 72 , nine-institution multi-center trial lead Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center . With Trisenox , 70 % subject achieve complete remission , 79 % complete responder achieve molecular remission measure reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . Complete remission achieve average within two month initiation Trisenox . Sixty-eight percent subject achieve complete remission still alive 58 % disease free , median follow-up time 16 month . To date , optimal dose schedule Trisenox yet define . This agent administer daily , twice week , weekly dos . As evidence one regimen clearly superior , sake convenience , participant trial receive Trisenox weekly schedule . Administration chemotherapy weekly schedule commonly utilized across broad spectrum regimen tumor type . On trial , subject receive dose intravenous Trisenox 0.35 mg/kg day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 two hour . Each cycle 28 day length . Subjects receive two treatment cycle ( 8 week ) undergo objective radiographic tumor assessment . On study , subject may receive maximum 12 treatment cycle . As outlook subject advance primary liver cancer poor , new regimen treatment strategy must evaluate .</detailed_description>
