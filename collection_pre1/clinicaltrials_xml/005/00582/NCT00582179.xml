	<brief_title>Vacuum Assisted Closure Treatment Draining Hematomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Application VAC device may significantly decrease incidence drain hematoma require surgical irrigation debridement . The aim project perform prospective , randomize study evaluate VAC negative pressure device treatment drain hematoma . We also analyze cost treating hematoma VAC compare currently employ treatment . Additionally , document incidence infection hematoma without use VAC device . Patients drain hematoma five day follow surgery give inform consent enter study randomize two group . Group A patient treated pressure dress observation , common current method treatment . Group B patient treat VAC negative pressure device . Patients carefully monitor continued drainage evaluate wound dressing clinically . Patients either group still drain ten day follow surgery take operating room irrigation debridement . Patients either group develop infection immediately treat irrigation debridement .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient orthopaedic surgical procedure follow trauma drain wound least five day No clinical evidence infection Adult patient ( 19 year old ) An infected hematoma . Infection define clinical sign symptom infection include increase drainage , increase pain , purulent drainage , increase erythema . Any hematomas thought infect cultured confirm diagnosis A surgical incision cover VAC sponge water impermeable sheet ( Tegaderm ) achieve close vacuum environment wound Wounds associate surgical incision intentionally leave open heal either delayed primary closure secondary granulation Abnormal coagulation lead expand hematoma require surgical debridement Prisoners Pregnant Women Inability comply protocol Patients family member unable unwilling sign study consent</criteria>
