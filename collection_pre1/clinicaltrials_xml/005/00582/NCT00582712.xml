	<criteria>Histologically confirm MTC sign residual/persistent disease base tumor marker level and/or radiographic imaging . Pathologic diagnosis must confirm UWCCC . Grading must confirm pathologic review perform UWCCC . Elevated neuroendocrine marker least 1 month post op . In MTC , persistently elevate neuroendocrine marker calcitonin CEA indicative persistent disease . Disease progression require trial 4 week completion major surgery , chemotherapy , systemic therapy local liver therapy study registration . Subjects standard care prior enrollment . Subjects standard care prior enrollment ( example could include total thyroidectomy , central lymph node dissection , necessary ipsilateral radical neck dissection tailor patient ) . 3 week completion radiation therapy study registration The following laboratory value obtain within 14 day prior registration : Absolute neutrophils count ( ANC ) ≥ 1000/mm3 Platelets ≥ 75,000/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL Total bilirubin great equal 2.0 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST great equal 3 X ULN great equal 5 X ULN liver metastases present Creatinine great equal ULN Serum sodium within normal limit ECOG performance status 2 Capable understanding investigational nature , potential risk benefit study , able provide valid inform consent . Availability tissue specimens analyze pathologic confirmation . Age ≥ 18 year . Women must pregnant lactate due deleterious effect Lithium carbonate fetus small child . All female childbearing potential must blood test urine study within 2 week prior registration rule pregnancy . Women childbearing potential sexually active male require use accepted effective method contraception . Patients must know history allergic reaction adverse reaction Lithium derivative . Patients allow concurrent chemotherapy radiation therapy . Gastrointestinal tract disease result inability take oral medication ( i.e . ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , bowel obstruction , inability swallow tablet ) . Significant , active cardiac disease Patients must take follow medication : diuretic , ACE inhibitor , NSAIDs ( except aspirin sulindac ) , neuroleptic , tetracycline , COX2 inhibitor . Patients radiographic evidence disease present option undergo tumor biopsy although mandatory . Patients already take Lithium reason allow study</criteria>
