	<criteria>Male female patient 18 year age old . If female , must postmenopausal , surgically sterile use adequate contraception , lactating , negative urine blood pregnancy test screening , prior administration study medication . Presence candidemia ( positive blood culture ) invasive candidiasis ( histopathologic cytopathologic examination needle aspiration biopsy specimen normally sterile site exclude mucous membrane show yeast cell ) obtain within prior 96 hour study entry ( ( inform consent provide ) . Presence one follow sign symptom acute fungal infection within prior 48 hour initiation study treatment : Fever define oral temperature great equal 38 degree C ( 100.4 degree F ) ; rectal core temperature great equal 38.6 degree C ( 101.4 degree F ) , axillary temperature great equal 37.5 degree Celsius ( 99.5 degree F ) . Hypothermia define rectal core temperature le 36.0 degree C ( 96.8 degree F ) . Hypotension ( systolic blood pressure [ SBP ] le 100 mmHg , SBP decrease great equal 30 mm Hg baseline . Localized sign symptom inflammation ( swell , heat , erythema purulence site infect Candida spp. ) . Patient classify one follow category base previous antifungal treatment : receive less 48 hour previous systemic antifungal therapy single dose echinocandin therapy prior study entry ; intolerant infusion relate toxicity amphotericin B preparation despite appropriate supportive measure serum creatinine increase &gt; 1.5 mg/dl receive conventional lipid amphotericin B therapy ; lack clinical response and/or persistent positive blood culture least seven day systemic antifungal treatment polyene fluconazole adequate dose . APACHE II 9 score &lt; 25 study entry . Patients willing able give inform consent , legally authorize representative willing give inform consent patient behalf . Expected survival ( opinion investigator ) great 4 day . Hypersensitivity anidulafungin , echinocandins azoles . Participation presently within last 30 day trial investigational drug ( ) . Patients antiretroviral chemotherapy regimen include investigational drug may participate provided change therapy past 4 week change treatment anticipate study participation . Chronic refractory neutropenia define absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500 cells/mm3 28 day prior baseline visit . Confirmed suspect Candida osteomyelitis , endocarditis meningitis . Poor venous access would preclude IV drug delivery multiple blood draw . Prosthetic device suspect site infection unless device remove within 24 hour study entry . Fungal endophthalmitis confirm fundoscopy . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate trial participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation trial result , judgment investigator , would make Patient inappropriate entry trial .</criteria>
