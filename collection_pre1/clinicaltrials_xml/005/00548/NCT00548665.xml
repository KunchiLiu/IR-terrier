	<brief_title>Carotid Plaque Screening Trial Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tobacco smoke highly prevalent Switzerland ( 31 % adult ) , 50 % smoker die tobacco-related disease , mainly cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . The smoking prevalence make evaluation new strategy smoke cessation crucial priority . The presence plaque atherosclerosis ( `` cholesterol '' deposit artery wall ) , measure carotid ultrasound , increase risk future CVD . The use plaque screen motivate patient improve smoke cessation receive little attention . In one study , screen atherosclerotic plaque increase self-reported rate smoke cessation , without biochemical validation cessation smoker low nicotine dependence . Moreover , trial examine impact plaque screen control cardiovascular risk factor . We propose randomize controlled trial carotid plaque screen 530 regular smoker age 40-70 year , recruit community , measure impact plaque screen smoke cessation ( main outcome ) control cardiovascular risk factor ( secondary outcome ) 1-year follow-up . Secondary outcome low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , hemoglobin A1C ( diabetes ) , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein blood pressure . Smokers receive advice smoke cessation , , randomly assign either intervention group ( plaque screen ) control group ( without plaque screening ) . Smokers one carotid plaque receive picture plaque standardize explanation . To ensure equal contact condition , smoker undergo ultrasound without plaque receive standardize explanation risk tobacco smoking . This study innovative plaque screen promise increasingly use strategy motivate patient stop smoke improve control cardiovascular risk factor , effectiveness poorly study . Successful completion project provide strong scientific basis use strategy smoke cessation control cardiovascular risk factor . If test effective tool , test might represent important waste expenditure , healthcare expenditure use strategy . Given scope global illness burden due CVD , simplicity propose test ( ultrasound carotids ) smoke prevalence Switzerland , evaluation new strategy smoke cessation long-term smoker primary prevention CVD important public health priority . Beyond randomize 1-year study , extend follow-up 3 year add abdominal aneurysm screen ultrasound intervention group ass association cardiovascular risk factor development small abdominal aortic aneurysm .</detailed_description>
