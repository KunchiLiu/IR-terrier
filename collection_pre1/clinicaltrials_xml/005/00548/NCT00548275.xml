	<brief_title>Reducing Sex-Related HIV Risk Behaviors Patients Receiving Treatment Opioid Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The profile opioid dependence change United States . According 2006 National Survey Drug Use Health ( NSDUH ) , 3.7 million Americans use heroin least lifetime half million individual use heroin within past year . Approximately 323,000 individual meet criterion past-year heroin abuse dependence . While figure concern , increase prevalence prescription opioid abuse dependence also worrisome . In 2006 12.6 million report non-medical use prescription opioids . Of , 1.6 million meet criterion prescription opioid abuse dependence . Sex-related HIV risk behavior prevalent amongst opioid dependent individual one study reporting unprotected intercourse within prior 30 day 75 % patient . Given 79-85 % U.S. HIV/AIDS case secondary sexual transmission , non-injecting drug use increase , relative contribution sex-related HIV risk behavior increase well . While drug treatment methadone , recently buprenorphine ( BUP ) , new medication effective treatment opioid dependence prescribe office-based physician , show decrease drug-related HIV risk behavior , prior research demonstrate BUP appear impact significantly sex-related HIV risk behavior . While process HIV risk behavior change begin risk assessment , study show physician , general , frequently address risky behavior patient . The current literature lacking , however , regard prevalence specific high-risk sexual behavior patient enrol BUP treatment . Interventions specifically target counsel sex-related HIV risk behavior deliver patient receive BUP treatment refine . The propose research evaluate prevalence specific sex-related HIV risk behavior patient enrol office-based BUP treatment patient ' perception provider ' screening behavior ( Phase 1 ) . These result inform conduct subsequent randomize clinical trial evaluate efficacy sex-related HIV risk reduction counsel intervention ( Phase 2 ) . Phase 1 . We hypothesize sex-related HIV risk behavior prevalent opioid dependent patient enrol BUP treatment patient report provider fail screen behavior . The specific aim determine patient enter BUP treatment : 1 ) prevalence specific sex-related HIV risk behavior , 2 ) patient report , provider 's screening behavior . Phase 2 . We hypothesize opioid dependent patient receive office-based BUP , Enhanced Sexual Risk Management ( ESRM ) effective increase specific safe sex practice compare standard physician counseling , Standard Sexual Risk Management ( SSRM ) demonstrate cost-effectiveness overall compare SSRM . The specific aim randomize clinical trial 1 ) determine efficacy ESRM compare SSRM , individual enrol BUP treatment 2 ) To compare cost-effectiveness ESRM versus SSRM individual enrol BUP treatment . These intervention adapt exist effective intervention evaluate two recently conduct multi-site randomized clinical trial , CDC-funded Project RESPECT NIMH-funded Project Light.20 , 21</detailed_description>
