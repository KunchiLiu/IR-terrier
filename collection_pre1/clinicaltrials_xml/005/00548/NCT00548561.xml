	<brief_title>Efficacy TopotectTM ( Dexrazoxane ) Accidental Extravasation Anthracyclines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accidental extravasation anthracyclines include doxorubicin derivative epirubicin , may cause severe , progressive tissue necrosis require surgical removal damage tissue . Thus , patient subject major surgery cause substantial delay treatment primary cancer disease . Tissue infiltration anthracyclines may detect fluorescence microscopy . This test perform hospital Denmark . In large preclinical trial , well 4 clinical case , dexrazoxane proven prevent severe tissue necroses . This trial determine effect dexrazoxane acute treatment ( acute antidote ) patient anthracycline extravasation verify fluorescence biopsy . Purpose Primary : • To avoid surgical intervention follow accidental extravasation anthracycline drug , thus prevent patient sequela . Secondary : - To avoid deleterious postponement cancer treatment . - To evaluate describe subjective objective symptom damage area follow treatment TopotectTM . - To evaluate tolerability/toxicity TopotectTM use indication , accord indicated schedule . Trial Population 25 patient accidental anthracycline extravasation confirm fluorescence microscopy Trial Design Open-label clinical trial . Twenty-five consecutive patient acute ( &lt; 6 hour ) history anthracycline extravasation confirm fluorescence microscopy ( general practice candidate acute plastic surgical intervention ) include . Effect Variables Response rate , presence late sequela , time progression , clinical consequence progression . Safety Features - Any toxicity cause TopotectTM study blood test , systematic question regard subjective discomfort , well objective clinical examination . - A systematic clinical evaluation mark area skin cover area extravasation perform assure prompt treatment deterioration occur . - Sequential colour photograph involve skin area take .</detailed_description>
