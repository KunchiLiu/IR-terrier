	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetic woman decrease insulin requirement early pregnancy . Preliminary evidence suggest decrease may secondary regeneration pancreatic B-cells pregnancy During second third trimester , insulin requirement Type 1 diabetic woman progressively increase approximately 36 week gestation time plateau , frequently , drop insulin requirement . We hypothesize regeneration pancreatic islet cell mass Type 1 diabetic woman pregnancy . In cross-sectional study , use acute insulin c-peptide response arginine determine pancreatic islet mass increase 12 36 week gestation . Type 1 diabetic woman pregnant , 12 36 week gestation , 6 week post-partum undergo intravenous arginine tolerance test follow overnight fast . If find regeneration beta cell open possibility therapy may direct end people Type 1 diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For pilot phase study contact woman type 1 diabetes . The study explain subject ask sign inform consent . Each subject ask complete brief medical history lifestyle questionnaire . Subjects blood sample take glucose C-peptide intravenous arginine stimulation test . For study test , subject ask come Clinical Investigations Unit University Alberta Hospital overnight fast study . The intravenous arginine test 10 minute test cause hyperglycemia , advantage glucose set pregnancy . Arginine infusion The intravenous arginine infusion test perform overnight fast great equal 8 hour . Subjects may drink water . For Type 1 diabetic patient insulin , long-acting insulin may take less 8 hour prior test ; food short-acting insulin may take within 5 hour test . Lispro insulin take within 4 hour test . On morning test , intravenous catheter , use 20 gauge IV intercath , place antecubital vein one arm sampling infusion . Veins kept patent infusion NaCl ( 0.9 % ) 25 mL/hr throughout test . The arm sample obtain warm 55 C heat blanket assist arterialization venous sample . Baseline blood sample glucose C-peptide measurement draw serum gel barrier tube minus 10 0 minute . An injection 5 g arginine ( 20 ml Sabex ) dilute 20 ml normal saline equal 40 ml administer 30 second , start time 0 . The vein immediately flush 20mL normal saline . Blood sample insulin C-peptide drawn barrier tube 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 10 minute serum separate transferred cryogenic tube analysis . The acute C-peptide response arginine define mean three high insulin C-peptide value 2 5 minute start arginine infusion mean minus 10 0 value subtract . Blood sample ( basal stimulate ) analyze glucose C-peptide . The insulin response measure Type 1 subject would meaningless C-peptide response use . Blood glucose determine hexokinase method use Hitachi 917 system ( Roche Diagnostics , Indianapolis , IN ) . C-peptide assay An Ultrasensitive C-peptide ELISA method use analyze C-peptide . This test specific low concentration C-peptide blood , specifically patient abnormal insulin secretion . Statistical Analysis/Power calculation Upon significance test result group difference , proceed multiple comparison group locate source significance , adjust multiple significance testing , use method Bonferroni . Expected Possible Findings/ Conclusion We hope show pancreatic islet mass may present woman Type 1 diabetes . Any demonstration beta-cell recovery even unique set pregnancy would excite , would demonstrate progenitor beta cell present pancreas type 1 diabetes subject .</detailed_description>
