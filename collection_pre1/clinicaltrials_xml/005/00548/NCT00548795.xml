	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) severe lung condition result bacterial infection lung . Viral infection may impair body 's immune system response bacteria , may lead serious lung injury . This study evaluate association immune response ARDS severity people ARDS plus viral infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Viral-Related Neutrophil Response Condition Severity People With ARDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ARDS serious condition involve inflammation fluid accumulation lung , lead low blood oxygen level breathe failure . It often fatal affect approximately 150,000 individual year United States . Common underlying cause include bacterial infection , lung trauma , pneumonia . Even people similar risk factor ARDS , often vary level condition severity . This may people experience ongoing viral infection predispose bacterial infection , worsen severity ARDS . Viruses release protein call Type I interferon . This protein increase response interferon stimulate gene ( ISG ) neutrophil , white blood cell protect body disease infection destroy bacteria . Preliminary study show people risk ARDS elevate ISGs neutrophil ISGs associate impaired neutrophil response increase severity ARDS . This study evaluate association viral-related neutrophil ISG response severity ARDS . Participants include people mechanical ventilation enrol either ARDSNet 06 07 study . For study , participant undergo blood collection within 48 hour begin main ARDSNet study . There study visit specifically study . Study researcher analyze participant ' blood sample ARDSNet study data gather information mortality , number ventilator-free day , marker severity organ dysfunction inflammation , neutrophil response .</detailed_description>
