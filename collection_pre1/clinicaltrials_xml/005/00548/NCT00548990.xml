	<brief_title>The Immune Function Intervention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The extent exercise training long-term physical activity influence poorly regulate immune function elderly unclear . Preliminary evidence suggest exercise training may improve various immune function measure old adult . Although findings potential substantial public health importance , majority study suffer small sample size , inadequate measurement physical fitness , weak research design . This study design overcome limitation employ longitudinal randomize control trial examine effect exercise training clinically relevant immune function measure old adult ( 65-80 year ) . Moreover , relationship several factor know altered exercise training change immune function assess . As , two specific aim address . In Aim 1 , 10-month exercise trial determine whether moderate intensity aerobic exercise training improve immune function previously sedentary old adult . In Aim 2 , role play physiological , behavioral , psychosocial factor relationship exercise training improve immune function examine . 150 sedentary participant randomly assign either 10-month moderate aerobic exercise training program sedentary control group . Clinically relevant measure immune function include delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) response battery antigens antibody response tetanus toxoid influenza virus vaccination assess , intervention . We hypothesize exercise training result improve immune response include high peak antibody titer DTH response , sustain level protective antibody .</detailed_description>
