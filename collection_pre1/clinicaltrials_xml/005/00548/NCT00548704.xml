	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Topotect® ( Dexrazoxane ) Treatment Accidental Extravasation Anthracyclines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accidental extravasation anthracyclines , e.g . doxorubicin derivative epirubicin , may cause progressive tissue destruction include serious damage skin , subcutaneous tissue , muscle , nerve . The patient may suffer acute local symptom pain swell , may progress blister necrosis . Subsequently dysesthesia , skin atrophy , disfigurement , impaired limb function may consequence . Surgical removal affect tissue require debridement often necessitate split skin grafting . The patient thus subject distress major surgery , turn lead delay cytotoxic treatment . Preclinical animal study well clinical multicenter phase II trial demonstrate highly significant efficacy dexrazoxane prevent tissue destruction cause anthracyclines . This confirmatory trial determine effect Topotect® ( dexrazoxane ) acute antidote patient anthracycline extravasation . Orphan drug status TopoTarget A/S grant designation Topotect® orphan medical product treatment anthracycline extravasation European Commission September 2001 FDA ? ? ? . Purpose Primary objective : • To prevent progression anthracycline extravasation lesion tissue ulceration necrosis require surgical intervention Secondary objective : - To prevent development deep tissue necrosis destruction lead late sequela impair limb function neurological deficit - To prevent postponement schedule cancer treatment due treatment extravasation - To evaluate tolerance and/or toxicity Topotect® use indication , accord indicated schedule Trial design This open-label , non-randomised phase II/III trial . Thirty -five evaluable patient anthracycline extravasation treat . Extravasation determine presence pain , and/or swelling , and/or redness site anthracycline leakage suspect occur . The extravasation subsequently confirm patient fluorescence microscopy least two punch biopsy time accident . Success criteria The prevention surgical intervention , necrosis late sequela evaluate 3 month extravasation . Safety feature - Toxicity cause Topotect® examine haematology blood chemistry , question ask discomfort . Scheduled clinical examination perform - A systematic clinical evaluation mark area skin cover area extravasation perform order evaluate need surgery - Sequential colour photograph involve skin take Medical Treatment Patients treat intravenous infusion Topotect® administer daily three consecutive day follow dos : 1,000 mg/m2 + 1,000 mg/m2 + 500 mg/m2 . The first dose administer soon possible within 6 hour extravasation next two dose 24 48 hour first infusion .</detailed_description>
