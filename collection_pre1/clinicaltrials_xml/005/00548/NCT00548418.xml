	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether combination topotecan , cisplatin bevacizumab effective treatment recurrent persistent cervical cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topotecan , Cisplatin Bevacizumab Recurrent/Persistent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical cancer remain major cause morbidity mortality woman . Chemoradiation lead improvement survival , prognosis patient recurrent , metastatic cervical cancer remain poor . There need effective treatment management recurrent/persistent cervical cancer . Angiogenesis appear play important role cervical cancer development progression , therefore VEGF inhibition appear rationale therapeutic strategy cervical cancer . There increase evidence combine anti-angiogenic agent either cytotoxic chemotherapy radiation enhance anti-tumor activity . This study combine current active chemotheraputic regimen cervical cancer ( cisplatin + topotecan ) anti-angiogenic agent .</detailed_description>
