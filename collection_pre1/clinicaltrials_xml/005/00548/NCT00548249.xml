	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Dialysate contain soluble iron ( Soluble Ferric Pyrophosphate ) safe effective maintain physiological iron level chronic hemodialysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Ranging Study Dialysate Containing Soluble Iron Treat Subjects With End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) Receiving Chronic Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design evaluate efficacy SFP-containing dialysate solution maintain physiological iron level chronic hemodialysis , measure primary endpoint percent patient whose Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) decrease least 1.0 gram/ deciliter ( g/dL ) baseline . The efficacy safety finding use determine optimal concentration SFP need safely maintain iron level , compensate iron loss chronic hemodialysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Selected 1 . Adult subject ≥ 18 year age undergoing chronic hemodialysis endstage renal disease ( ESRD ) three time week 2 . Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) value two successive screening/baseline measure immediately prior start study average 10.1 11.5 grams/ deciliter ( g/dL ) , inclusive 3 . Transferrin Saturation ( TSAT ) value average 20 % , exceed 35 % , prior dialysis measure screening period 4 . Ferritin value average 200 800 micrograms/ liter ( µg/L ) , inclusive , measured screening period . An average ferritin 800 µg/L great 1200 µg/L allow average TSAT 20 % great 25 % . 5 . Except vascular access surgery , subject hospitalization previous three month significant illness , opinion Investigator , confers significant risk hospitalization course study . No blood transfusion within last 4 week allow . 6 . Subject adequate dialyzer blood flow rate acceptable Principal Investigator 1 . Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) value two successive baseline/screening measurement average ≥ 11.6g/dL 2 . Subject current malignancy involve site skin 3 . Subject history drug alcohol abuse within last six month 4 . Subject believe unable complete entire study ( e.g. , due concurrent disease , life expectancy less year ) 5 . Subject Principal Investigator considers place increase risk study procedures 6 . Subject require hemodialysis 3 time per week regular basis . 7 . Subject unable discontinue oral iron intravenous iron supplement duration study 8 . Subject pregnant 9 . Subject consider incompetent give inform consent 10 . Subject positive test Hepatitis B Surface Antigen within past 30 day screen 11 . Subject know HIV infection ( know , HIV test perform ) 12 . Subject cirrhosis liver base histological criterion clinical criterion ( presence ascites , esophageal varix , spider nevus , history hepatic encephalopathy ) . Subject hepatitis C , absence cirrhosis , exclude participation study ALT AST level 2 time upper limit normal consistently 2 month precede enrollment 13 . Subject active tuberculosis , fungal , viral , parasitic infection 14 . Subject active bacterial infection require antibiotic therapy 15 . Subject predialysis Corrected Qwave Twave ( QTc ) interval ≥ 470 millisecond ( m ) 16 .
