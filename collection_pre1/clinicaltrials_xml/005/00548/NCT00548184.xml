	<brief_summary>We think lapatinib help shrink tumor give prior main primary therapy kind breast cancer diagnose . When treatment give main primary therapy , call neoadjuvant therapy . We compare lapatinib lapatinib plus trastuzumab ( herceptin ) 12 week . If tumor estrogen receptor positive ( ER positive ) , estrogen deprivation also give . Tumors ER positive lot estrogen receptor find . This also call `` expression '' amplification estrogen receptor . The important information get study see response `` neoadjuvant '' ( treatment give main treatment ) , lapatinib trastuzumab ( herceptin ) tumor tissue sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The neoadjuvant setting especially attractive study predictive biologic correlate several reason include early assessment response therapy , access primary tumor , reduce patient number compare required adjuvant setting . Response neoadjuvant therapy validate surrogate marker improve survival ; may use test overall efficacy neoadjuvant treatment regimens response primary tumor mirror effect therapy micrometastases . Trastuzumab efficacious agent HER2 overexpressing breast cancer . Our result neoadjuvant trastuzumab indicate efficacy may better patient treatment-na√Øve tumor compare metastatic disease , 26 % patient show partial response 3 week therapy . No patient progress 3-week period . We also conduct neoadjuvant lapatinib study give single agent 6 week . The response rate second study impressive great 80 % response patient HER2 positive locally advanced breast cancer . It likely true response rate HER2 blockade would higher therapy continue longer . We therefore hypothesize lapatinib , dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor , together trastuzumab , result tumor regression give neoadjuvant therapy HER2 overexpressing breast cancer . We compare lapatinib plus trastuzumab 12 week , tumor express ER , estrogen deprivation also administer . This phase II trial . Clinical efficacy assess bidimensional tumor measurement primary cancer baseline , end week 12 . Objective tumor response rate define objective bidimensional tumor measurement neoadjuvant treatment 12 week calculate , assess accord standard RECIST criterion . Pathologic responses grade pathologic complete response invasive cancer residual breast time surgery . Near pathologic complete response also document residual disease le 1 cm .</detailed_description>
