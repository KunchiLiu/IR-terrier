	<brief_title>Evaluation Multiple Needle Use EUS-FNA Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomized control trial recruit patient refer suspicion pancreatic mass indication EUS-FNA part standard care Interventional Endoscopy Unit University Of Chicago Medical Center . Basic demographic data record patient . If pancreatic mass confirm EUS evaluation patient randomize 1:1 ratio either Control group ( Single needle ) Investigational group ( Multiple Needle ) . There expert cytopathologist exploration room ( blind group assignment ) . Samples obtain FNA prepare onsite either cytological evaluation cytopathologist : fine needle sample express use 10mL air-filled syringe onto separate glass slide , direct smear make on-site cytopathologist . Each slide air-dried and/or alcohol fix ( 95 % ethanol ) , direct smear prepare immediate interpretation stain Diff-quick staining system . Patients assign simple needle group ( SN ) sample total 6 consecutive FNA pass single EUS-FNA needle ( replace needle reduced performance ) . After complete 6th pass endoscopist inform onsite cytopathologist preliminary cytological diagnosis . Patients assign multiple needle group ( MN ) sample total 6 consecutive FNA pass , replace needle every 2 pass . After complete 6th pass endoscopist inform onsite cytopathologist preliminary cytological diagnosis . A cytopathologist ( # 1 ) present EUS-FNA procedure prepare slide determine whether specimen adequately cellular . After procedure , cytological sample send Pathology department order complete study . A cytopathologist ( # 2 ) present procedure study sample specimen obtain EUS-FNA procedure produce final definitive cytopathological diagnosis . Criteria pancreatic cancer benign pancreatic lesion define . Follow-up patient assess early late complication carry 30 day procedure . Endpoints : 1 . Primary endpoint : Evaluate early change needle EUS-FNA suspect pancreatic cancer reduce number pass need obtain preliminary cytological diagnosis neoplasia . We hypothesize number pass need use multiple needle significantly less use single needle . 2 . Secondary endpoint : - Rate complication relate EUS-FNA - Influence different factor obtain positive cytological result ( histological differentiation )</detailed_description>
