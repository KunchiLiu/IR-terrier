	<brief_title>Tâˆ’Cell Turnover Following Vaccination With MVA85A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MVA85A promise new vaccine design prevent tuberculosis ( TB ) dramatically boost pre-existing response BCG , license vaccine disease present . In BCG vaccinate individual induces strong immune response . However little known evolution response kinetics T-cells ( immune cell respond vaccine ) immediately follow vaccination . Crucially , outcome process may determine long term protection disease . This study aim define early immune response MVA85A first apply safe , non-radioactive 'label ' - deuterium - measure T-cell turnover follow vaccination . This labelling approach use successfully study collaborator examine immune cell kinetics human clinical study UK last 8 year . The result data provide insight immune response generate MVA85A aid future design modification T-cell inducing vaccine . Group 1 ( Immune response ) Previous human study MVA85A describe immune response vaccination fix timepoints . The investigator vaccinate four volunteer measure immune response daily 14 day . This provide important new data aid interpretation kinetics data group 2 3 . Groups 2 &amp; 3 ( Labelling ) Eight volunteer vaccinate receive time infusion deuterated glucose . Blood collect follow period determine rate uptake loss label respond immune cell .</detailed_description>
