	<brief_summary>Background : Pneumonia lead cause childhood mortality , account 19 % 10.6 million death occur year1 . Case-control study Ethiopia2 India3 suggest sub-clinical vitamin D deficiency may increase ten time risk pneumonia child . We postulate control childhood vitamin D deficiency potential dramatically reduce incidence pneumonia save &gt; 700,000 life year since vitamin D deficiency widespread develop country . Aim : To investigate whether 3-monthly oral supplementation 100,000iu vitamin D reduce pneumonia consequence among child age 1-12 month ( follow 18 month ) , live deprive area Kabul , Afghanistan , &gt; 70 % young child vitamin D deficient ( &lt; 8ng/dl ) . The effect vitamin D incidence disease , particular diarrhea rickets also investigate . Methods : Randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial : 3000 child randomise receive either 6 dos vitamin D placebo . The first dose give start autumn second subsequent dos every 3 month thereafter ; child follow 18 month . Incidence pneumonia ascertain though weekly home visit ( active surveillance ) attendances admission trial clinic ward hospital serve study area ( passive surveillance ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vitamin D , essential micronutrient biological function formation maintenance strong bone . Vitamin D may help maintain healthy immune system . In vitro study show 1,25-dihydroxyvitamine D3 ( 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 ) , active metabolite vitamin D important promote regulate immune response . 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 immune system modulator induces expression TLR co-receptor CD145 . 1,25 ( OH ) 2D3 directly induce antimicrobial gene expression activity point important therapeutic us treatment opportunistic antibiotic resistant infection . Sub-clinical vitamin D deficiency associate increase risk tuberculosis adult modification polymorphism vitamin D receptor . Vitamin acquire primarily sunlight ; ultraviolet ray trigger synthesis skin , reduce darker skin . The required UV light also reduce distance equator zero latitudes 500 winter . Vitamin D deficiency cause rickets , common problem many develop country ; prevalences 5 45 % under-5 year old child find , even place abundant sunlight . Pneumonia lead cause childhood mortality , account 19 % 10.6 million death occur year . Hospital-based case-control study Ethiopia India suggest vitamin D deficiency may substantially increase risk severe pneumonia young child . High rate vitamin D deficiency also find among child admit hospital pneumonia , range 43 % Tehran Kuwait 27 50 % Yemen . Afghanistan high under-5 infant mortality ( 257 165 deaths/1000 live birth respectively ) , pneumonia lead cause death child . Women young child little exposure sunlight , thus risk vitamin D deficiency . Women travel home regularly ; wear burka clothing cover hand face . Swaddling infant reduce exposure sunlight , keep young child mother 's vicinity indoors . A survey winter 2005 confirm high level vitamin D deficiency among young child Kabul . Controlling deficiency potential dramatically reduce incidence pneumonia save life . Three-monthly oral dos 100,000iu vitamin D proven safe effective alleviate vitamin D deficiency high risk normal rackettic child . Thus propose conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) Afghanistan test . Study area : The trial carry District 1,2,3,7 8 Kabul ( latitude 34.280 N ) , vitamin D deficiency prevalence study conduct 2005 . Most old part Kabul narrow , shade lane often roof top high wall mud house ; house small courtyard high wall much day sunshine reach courtyard . The population socio-economically deprive large family ( 5-10 child ) . Recruitment : Community sensitisation conduct community religious leader public meeting . Recruitment proceed street choose area within catchment area study continue house house along street 3000 child recruit ; 40 female Fieldworkers pair recruit average 6 10 child per day 1-month period . Informed consent : At recruitment Fieldworker explain family purpose study , benefit offer procedure involve . An information sheet detail study objective , procedure , risk benefit also give parent . Informed consent obtain mother father child : finger print signature ( literacy rate estimate &lt; 50 % ) obtain presence two witness , one friend family member one second Fieldworker . Baseline data : At recruitment regular period throughout study , Fieldworkers collect data range socio-economic demographic variable , well know risk factor pneumonia vitamin D deficiency , include exposure cigarette smoke , type fuel , vaccination , supplementation , diet/breastfeeding , sun exposure . Dosing/intervention period : 6 dos 100,000iu vitamin D , placebo , give Fieldworkers first weekly home visit follow recruitment 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 15 month later . If child vomit time supplementation , Fieldworker return weekly dose symptom subside . Randomization packaging intervention/placebo : An independent statistician produce randomization list allocate individual study number vitamin D placebo within variable block study number . This list use source Pharmacy Department AKU Hospital Karachi produce individual single dose seal 1ml syrinx child label one study number . There characteristic would distinguish vitamin D dissolve olive oil olive oil placebo syrinx ; know side-effects distinguish take vitamin D placebo.Oil syrinx drop mouth child doze . During dose week , Fieldworkers receive 10 syrinx day consecutive study number use day check conduct even . Thus Fieldworkers ever 10 single dos possession , minimize possibility mis-dosing . Home visit ( active case find follow-up ) : For 18 month every 2 week , Fieldworkers collect information sign symptom acute respiratory infection diarrhea last 14 day , current breastfeeding status vital status study child . They also train take child 's temperature , count respiratory rate twice use UNICEF respiratory rate stop watch , examine low chest wall indrawing , look dehydration refer study clinic appropriate . The cause death occur home ascertain use verbal autopsy . Outpatient clinic hospital admission pneumonias : The first port call trial outpatient clinic set within Maywand Teaching Hospital locate study area within easy reach recruit family . This run 4 paediatrician , receive refresher training diagnosis pneumonia ; work shift system cover 24 hour , 7 day week . They supervise 1 senior paediatrician he/she also examine randomly sample child see clinic . The paediatrician fill detailed clinical assessment form child , conduct pulse oximetry , request X-rays treat ( accord standard IMCI ) 35 and/or refer admission severe pneumonia . The trial cover cost IMCI recommend hospital inpatient relate ALRI medication . Outcomes : The primary outcome study radiologically confirm first episode pneumonia accord WHO standard classification , i.e . [ presence dense fluffy opacity occupies portion whole lobe entire lung ] [ presence fluid lateral pleural space , lung chest wall ] 36 . X-rays read independent expert radiologist , blind child 's allocation clinical condition , use WHO Proforma Standardised Interpretation 36,37 chest radiograph diagnosis pneumonia child . The secondary outcome : ( 1 ) Moderate severe ALRI ( use IMCI criterion ) ( 2 ) Moderate severe diarrhea ( history loose stool &gt; 3 time per day history oral rehydration intravenous fluid therapy ) ( 3 ) Incidence hospital admission illness ; ( 4 ) Anthropometric indices 0 , 6 , 12 , 18 month ( weight height , weight age , height age , head circumference ) ( 5 ) All cause mortality pneumonia specific mortality ; ( 6 ) Biochemical marker vitamin D deficiency [ proportion child 25-OHD3 ( cholicalciferol ) &lt; 8ng/ml ] 38 week 6 post vitamin D dose three ( mid-spring ) four ( mid-summer ) random sample 50 child intervention placebo group [ We assume proportion child vitamin D deficiency 60 % placebo group reduce 30 % intervention group post vitamin D dose 3 4 . ] ; ( 7 ) Pharmacodynamics vitamin D supplementation determine measure serum 25-OHD3 ( cholicalciferol ) day 2 , week 6 week 12 post vitamin D dose one random sample 50 child intervention placebo group ] ( 8 ) The Thacher Radiological Score Rickets 1 wrist radiography 10 % random sample child end 18 month follow period . Additional inform consent obtain collect blood sample . The sub-samples child measure vitamin D level select independent statistician . Venous blood sample take home experience paediatric phlebotomist , transport trial laboratory end morning afternoon clot sample bottle inside vaccine cool-boxes contain ice-packs . They centrifuge experience retrained technician extract plasma frozen store &lt; 20◦◦C At end trial frozen sample transport AKU Micronutrient Research Laboratory Karachi high 4 pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) establish vitamin D status . Sample size : We estimate incidence acute lower respiratory infection ( ALRI ) placebo group 0.065/child /year 39 12 % ALRI pneumonia 1 . We assume 25 % pneumonias repeat episode 18 month follow period . Thus incidence first episode pneumonia placebo group 0.0585/child/year ( 0.65*0.12*0.75 ) . We expect 35 % reduction incidence pneumonia vitamin D group give 73 % child vitamin D deficiency study area incidence pneumonia 10 time higher vitamin D deficient child normal child 18 , 26 . A study 80 % power 95 % significance detect 35 % reduction incidence pneumonia compare placebo group require 22079 child month per group37 . Since child follow 18 month study require 1227 child per group . Assuming 20 % loss follow study require 1472 child per group . In order facilitate randomization allocation staff round figure 1500 child per group . Sample size blood test process measure : 50 child per group give 80 % power detect 50 % reduction proportion child 1,25 ( OH ) 2D &lt; 8ng/ml ( 50 % conservative compare publish literature29-32 ) , assume deficiency 60 % placebo group ( conservative estimate ) .</detailed_description>
