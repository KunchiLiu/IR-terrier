	<detailed_description>Every participant receive active treatment ; placebo . After Amendment 2 , 24 mg alemtuzumab dose close enrollment newly enrol participant randomly assign treatment either 12 mg alemtuzumab interferon beta-1a 2:1 ratio ( , 2 give 12 mg alemtuzumab every 1 give interferon beta-1a ) . Alemtuzumab administer two annual course , begin study 1 year later . Interferon beta-1a self-injected 3 time per week 2 year . All participant require return study site every 3 month neurologic assessment . In addition , safety-related laboratory test perform least monthly . Participation study end 2 year start treatment participant . Additionally , participant receive alemtuzumab might follow CAMMS03409 Extension Study ( NCT00930553 ) safety efficacy assessment .
