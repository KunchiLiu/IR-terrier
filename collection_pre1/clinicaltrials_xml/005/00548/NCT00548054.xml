	<brief_summary>In order ass whether bivalent kill oral cholera vaccine may use safely among infant risk cholera , investigator need determine safety immunogenicity kill oral cholera vaccine among infant less 1 year age give expand program immunization ( EPI ) vaccine include diptheria , pertussis tetanus ( DPT ) , oral polio vaccine ( OPV ) , Hepatitis B vaccine measles vaccine . Furthermore , investigator also need make sure immune interference occur among vaccine antigen give time . Findings study pave way possible use kill whole cell oral cholera vaccine ( OCV ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cholera important public health problem worldwide , remain endemic develop world time cause outbreak area lapse sanitation occur . A monovalent ( anti-O1 ) oral kill cholera vaccine B-subunit develop Professor Jan Holmgren Sweden license pharmaceutical company United Kingdom . The technology vaccine transfer Vietnamese scientist National Institute Hygiene Epidemiology Hanoi mid-1980s . The Vietnamese developed bivalent vaccine , kill 0139 cell without B-subunit . Since licensure , 9 million dos give without report serious adverse event . The vaccine reformulate order internationalize vaccine . Phase II trial vaccine Son La , Vietnam Kolkata , India find vaccine safe serious adverse reaction associate vaccine . A phase III study reformulate vaccine ongoing Kolkata , India . The young person vaccine administer 1 year old . Previous study B-subunit contain kill whole cell vaccine find safe among infant young 6 month elicit significant vibriocidal response among 53 % vaccinee . However , data available regard use bivalent whole cell kill oral vaccine infant . Due high risk cholera among infant , possibility introduce cholera vaccine part expand programme immunization ( EPI ) need investigated . Data regard safety immunogenicity reformulate bivalent kill whole cell vaccine among infant need gather order pave way possible use vaccine cholera-endemic area infant child risk . Furthermore , data regard concomitant use vaccine EPI vaccine give young infant Diphtheria-Tetanus-whole cell Pertussis ( DTwP ) , Oral Polio Vaccine ( OPV ) Hepatitis B Measles vaccine . It would important determine interference exists kill whole cell vaccine antigens include regular EPI schedule . Providing killed whole cell vaccine context EPI make easy introduce cholera vaccine area cholera-endemic .</detailed_description>
