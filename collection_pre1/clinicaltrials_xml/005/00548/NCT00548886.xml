	<brief_summary>Long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) cardiac disorder may lead ventricular arrythmias culminate syncope and/or possible death . Recently , researcher develop way discover patient LQTS use low dos epinephrine continuous , intravenous infusion adult . Epinephrine , adrenaline , produce body time stress . By produce adrenaline , body allow adapt stressful environment take appropriate action ( i.e . fight flight response ) . By simulate response small amount epinephrine , researcher show prolongation QT interval occur normal healthy adult . However , adult confirm LQTS Type 1 ( LQTS-1 ) prolong QT interval give low dose epinephrine . Therefore , test act safe mean identify adult LQTS-1 prolong QT interval rest EKGs . However , LQTS disease adult , affect child well . Currently standard care obtain rest EKGs pediatric patient miss patient conceal LQTS . Those patient , old enough , undergo exercise testing . Yet leave young child unable run treadmill without diagnostic test . Hypothesis : The low-dose epinephrine infusion stress test cause prolongation QT interval electrophysiologically normal healthy pediatric population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-dose Epinephrine Infusion Tests Adolescent Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involve ask fifty child come hospital standard care procedure treat separate cardiac condition participate . Patients approach already intravenous line place procedure . After consent assent necessary obtain , patient bring separate room low-dose epinephrine infusion trial . The patient lie table , hook EKG machine infusion start . The amount epinephrine actually infuse base weight patient substantially less dose receive epinephrine auto-injection anaphylaxis . After 40 minute , trial complete patient may return wait room original procedure . We perform test number pediatric patient suspect LQTS promise result little side effect . The patient awake procedure able verbalize concern complaint . A pediatric electrophysiologist nurse present throughout entire procedure . The purpose study determine child infuse low amount epinephrine also maintain normal QT interval healthy adult . This study would hope prove low-dose epinephrine infusion trial serve way identify child LQTS may effectively treat potentially live save .</detailed_description>
