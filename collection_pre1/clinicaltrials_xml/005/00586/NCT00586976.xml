	<brief_title>A Phase II/III Study Continuous Local Anesthetic Infusion Median Sternotomy Following Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Cardiac surgery associate pain post-operative period . Recently ability infuse local anesthetic drug area sternal wound become available . The study do thus far show efficacy control pain small show clinically significant patient outcome difference . Specific Aim : We plan conduct phase II/III study local anesthetic infusion sternal wound adult patient undergoing cardiac surgery . In Phase II study , 40 patient enrol prospective observational open label , dose escalation study safety efficacy local anesthetic infusion sternal wound . Outcome measure efficacy visual analog pain ( VAP ) score opioid consumption . Outcome measure safety plasma ropivacaine concentration adverse event . The dose determine phase II study use Phase III study . In study , 200 patient enrol double blind prospective , randomize , double blind ; placebo control trial local anesthetic infusion sternal wound . Outcome measure efficacy visual analog pain ( VAP ) score , opioid consumption , time extubation , pulmonary function test , duration ICU hospital stay , cause morbidity mortality . Outcome measure safety adverse event . Hypothesis : Local anesthetic infusion sternal wound safe result improve pain control reduce time extubation , duration ICU hospital stay . Significance : This first large randomize control clinical trial assess outcome use local anesthetic infusion sternal wound patient undergo open-heart surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Be great 18 year age 2 . Be undergoing cardiac surgical procedure via median sternotomy ( i.e. , exclude occasional thoracotomy , since much great pain surgical approach postoperatively ) 1 . Are unable grant inform consent comply study procedure 2 . Are undergoing emergency open heartsurgery 3 . Allergic excipients ropivacaine , propofol , fentanyl 4 . Age &lt; 18 year age ( child dose toxicity concern ) 5 . Are pregnant ( pregnancy change pain threshold ) 6 . Taking preoperative opioids . ( Opioid tolerant patient require significantly postoperative opioid use . ) 7 . Cirrhosis hepatic failure ( may accumulation local anesthetic plasma due decrease metabolism ) 8 . Patient receive lidocaine infusion prior surgery . ( An extremely rare event ) 9 . Patients plan circulatory arrest surgical procedure ( increased duration intubation possible )</criteria>
