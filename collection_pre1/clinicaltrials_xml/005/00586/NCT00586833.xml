	<detailed_description>Congestive heart failure ( HF ) lead cause hospitalization among old Americans.1 Approximately half affect patient apparently normal systolic function ( HF preserve ejection fraction , HFpEF ) .2-4 In contrast HF low EF , proven treatment HFpEF , due largely lack mechanistic understanding.4 HFpEF patient typically old , hypertensive female,2,3 characteristic associate vascular stiffen dysfunction.5-7 Diastolic abnormality may contribute symptom exertional intolerance3,8 , non-cardiac limitation recently show equally important.9-11 Patients HFpEF display impair decrease mean vascular resistance response exercise , significantly limit performance,9 yet represent one component ventricular afterload . With age particularly HFpEF , pulsatile load due vascular stiffening increase wave reflection become magnified.6,12 The latter quantified pulse wave velocity , arterial compliance carotid augmentation index . These determine noninvasively , show abnormal HFpEF patient rest10,11 , little know change exercise stress , might modulate ventricular performance . Recent evidence indicate endothelial autonomic dysfunction present HFpEF9 , know abnormality might limit ventricular-vascular function exercise . The primary objective proposal compare rest exercise-induced change vascular function patient HFpEF age-matched control , determine factor may affect exercise performance cardiovascular reserve function . Specific Aim 1 . Contrast rest exercise-induced change vascular stiffness , endothelial function , afterload patient HFpEF age-matched control . Net , mean , late component afterload assess arterial elastance ( Ea ) , systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) , central augmentation index ( AI ) . Vascular stiffness quantify pulse wave velocity total arterial compliance . Stiffness afterload dynamically modulate endothelial autonomic function , response assess finger volume plethysmography . Parameters measure rest , upright cycle ergometry , immediately post exercise noninvasive blood pressure , tonometry comprehensive echo-Doppler examination tissue Doppler echo ( TDE ) . Specific Aim 2 . Determine baseline exercise-induced change vascular parameter measure specific aim 1 related LV systolic diastolic functional reserve , cardiac output response , metabolic exercise performance , change pulmonary capillary blood volume . LV systolic diastolic function assess echo-Doppler TDE parameter rest immediately peak exercise . Cardiac output response determine product echo-Doppler stroke volume heart rate . Exercise performance quantify expire gas analysis . Pulmonary blood volume estimate base upon ratio diffusion capacity nitric oxide carbon monoxide , obtain rest immediately post exercise . Regression analysis perform use measured component afterload vascular stiffness independent variable parameter dependent output variable delineate role vascular stiffen exercise performance , reserve ventricular-vascular coupling . Specific Aim 3 . Determine vascular ventricular stiffness property measure specific aim 1 associate abnormal neurohormonal response exercise . Blood sample obtain HFpEF subject control prior immediately peak exercise contrast exercise-induced change B-type natriuretic peptide level cyclic guanosine monophosphate level .</detailed_description>
