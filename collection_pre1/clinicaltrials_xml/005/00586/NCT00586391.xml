	<brief_summary>Patients study type lymph gland cancer call non-Hodgkin Lymphoma , Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia , chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( disease refer `` Lymphoma '' `` Leukemia '' ) . Their Lymphoma Leukemia come back go away treatment ( include best treatment know cancer ) . This research study gene transfer study use special immune cell . The body different way fight infection disease . No one way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight disease , antibodies T cell , hop work together . Antibodies type protein protect body bacterial disease . T cell , also call T lymphocyte , special infection-fighting blood cell kill cell include tumor cell . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer ; show promise , strong enough cure patient . T lymphocytes kill tumor cell normally enough kill tumor cell . Some researcher take T cell person 's blood , grown laboratory give back person . The antibody use study call anti-CD19 . It first come mouse develop immunity human lymphoma . This antibody stick cancer cell substance outside cell call CD19 . CD19 antibody use treat people lymphoma Leukemia . For study anti-CD19 change instead float free blood join T cell . When antibody join T cell way call chimeric receptor . In laboratory , investigator also find T cell work well also put protein stimulates T cell call CD28 . Investigators hope add CD28 might also make cell last long time body . These CD19 chimeric receptor T cell C28 T cell investigational product approve Food Drug Administration . The purpose study find big dose chimeric T cell safe , see T cell sort chimeric receptor last , learn side effect see whether therapy might help people lymphoma leukemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients give u blood make CD19 CD28 chimeric receptor-T cell laboratory . These cell grow frozen patient . To make T cell investigator take blood stimulate growth factor make T cell grow . To get CD19 antibody ( CD28 ) attach surface T cell , insert antibody gene T cell . This do virus call retrovirus make study carry antibody gene T cell . This virus also help u find T cell blood inject use special laboratory test . Because patient receive cell new gene follow total 15 year see long term side effect gene transfer . If patient visit clinic , may contact research coordinator physician . When patient enroll study , assign dose CD19 CD28 chimeric receptor-T cell . For intermediate low grade lymphoma/leukemia : The investigator ' study far show infused T cell may need receive extra boost order expand efficiently body . Therefore , 2 week T cell infusion , patient may receive one injection drug call ipilimumab , believe help T cell grow . This drug approve FDA treat certain cancer , melanoma , dose drug use study lower use treatment avoid side effect . Patients give injection cell vein IV assign dose . The injection take 10 minute . Patients follow clinic injection 3 hour . If 4-6 week evaluation period infusion , patient seem experience benefit ( confirmed radiological study , physical exam and/or symptom ) , may able receive three additional dos T cell wish . These additional infusion would least 4-6 week apart dose level receive first time lower dose . The treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Texas Children 's Hospital Houston Methodist Hospital . To learn way CD19 CD28 chimeric receptor-T cell work long last body , extra blood drawn .</detailed_description>
