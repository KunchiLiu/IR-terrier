	<brief_summary>The broad aim study evaluate efficacy photochemical tissue bonding ( PTB ) closure skin excision . We test hypothesis full thickness skin excision treat PTB heal less scar treated conventional suture closure method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photochemical Tissue Bonding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertrophic scar frequent endpoint traditional surgical excision skin cancer chest . These scar create significant long-term morbidity patient . There clinical need alternative treatment would reduce factor associate hypertrophic possibly keloid scar formation provide minimal tension , low infection risk absence foreign body material . This would result normal appear healed scar without associate patient morbidity . Photochemical tissue bonding may provide alternate treatment . PTB differs suture continuously join tissue surface molecular level rather discrete suture point . In addition , PTB incite foreign body reaction create tissue injury passage needle tie knot , injury may initiate scarring .</detailed_description>
