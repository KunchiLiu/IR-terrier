	<detailed_description>The purpose phase II study ass toxicity efficacy sequentially administer high dose chemotherapy follow autologous stem cell rescue treatment multiple myeloma . Multiple myeloma chemotherapy sensitive disease curative standard therapy median survival 2 4 year . Prior study show dose-intensified melphalan produce high response rate complete remission patient . Over past several year , multiple phase II study utilize high dose chemotherapy high dose chemo-radiotherapy autologous marrow peripheral blood stem cell rescue demonstrate improved response rate survival rate compare historical control . Recently prospective randomize trial demonstrate improved response rate , response duration overall survival utilize high dose therapy autologous bone marrow support compare standard chemotherapy . The primary cause failure relapse unclear many , , patient cure approach . Based observation efficacy Hodgkin 's Disease , Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma , breast cancer , approach utilize sequential high dose chemotherapy multiple myeloma develop . This protocol test sequential regimen multiple myeloma patient respond standard dose chemotherapy regimen prior enrollment . As originally write , eligible patient require sensitive disease . The protocol revise August 1998 allow entry patient newly diagnose myeloma stable progressive disease follow VAD chemotherapy . Patients recurrent myeloma still require chemotherapy sensitive disease . Eligible patient must also pathologically confirm multiple myeloma , prior bone marrow transplantation acceptable organ function ( pulmonary , renal , hepatic , cardiac ) . The recent revision protocol also allow entry patient renal insufficiency due multiple myeloma enrol protocol . Prior initiate high dose therapy , patient must undergo complete history physical exam routine lab work plus titer HIV , CMV , HSV , VCV : immunoglobulin level , beta-2 microglobulin serum protein electrophoresis well immunoelectrophoresis bone marrow aspirate biopsy . These study standard multiple myeloma patient . All patient require double Human Hickman place prior start therapy . The protocol originally write include total body irradiation high dose Melphalan preparative regimen patient receive prior radiotherapy . Patients eligible TBI receive high dose BCNU plus Melphalan . A revision remove TBI Melphalan arm protocol analysis 100 patient treat Stanford University Medical Center protocol show difference event-free survival overall survival TBI contain arm chemotherapy preparative regimen . The TBI arm drop due increase cost morbidity TBI associate schedule logistics problem . The revision protocol inclusion CD34 stem cell selection stem cell collect leukapheresis follow high dose cyclophosphamide . This change base result Phase III study demonstrate degree tumor cell contamination stem cell collection could decrease 3-6 log CD34 cell selection . The dose Melphalan also increase 200 mg/m2 completion dose escalation study Stanford .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient must receive multiagent base chemotherapy , preferably VAD , cytoreduction prior transplantation . The time last chemotherapy administration must great 21 day . Patients recurrent myeloma must sensitive disease demonstrated decrease serum urine paraprotein level &gt; 50 % decrease bone marrow plasmacytosis le 20 % . Patients newly diagnose myeloma may stable ( progressive ) disease follow VAD . Patients must pathology review diagnosis multiple myeloma confirm transplant center . Patients smolder multiple myeloma benign monoclonal gammopathy unknown significance exclude study .
