	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine recommend Phase II dose combination ABT-510 plus bevacizumab patient advance solid tumor evaluate dose limit toxicity non-dose limit toxicity combination . The secondary objective collect preliminary data effect combination ABT-510 plus bevacizumab versus agent individually dermal wound angiogenesis skin biopsy collect preliminary data clinical activity combination ( tumor response rate , progression-free survival , rate stable disease &gt; 6 month ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study ABT-510 Combination With Bevacizumab Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ABT-510 : In early 1990s , thrombospondin ( TSP-1 ) first recognize endogenously produce inhibitor angiogenesis . Since , thrombospondin show inhibit neovascularization tumorigenesis numerous mouse model . Its anti- angiogenesis property localize N-terminal region . Although small fragment region retain thrombospondin 's anti-angiogenesis property , researcher discover specific amino acid substitution greatly enhance property . From effort , ABT-510 , nine-amino acid synthetic peptide emerge novel anti-angiogenesis agent . The peptide soluble stable water administer parenterally acetate salt 5 % dextrose solution clinical use . ABT-510 evaluate three Phase I study : one single-dose study healthy volunteer two study cancer patient . Doses range 10 mg 260 mg evaluate IV infusion ( 30-minute ) , subcutaneous bolus injection , 24-hour subcutaneous infusion . Overall , ABT-510 well tolerate . A preliminary review 103 case report form collect date identify total 1306 adverse event . Ninety-one percent ( 1195/1306 ) event consider mild moderate nature . Eighty-one percent ( 1052/1306 ) event report related probably related ABT-510 . The common adverse event , occur &gt; 10 % patient , include injection site reaction , asthenia , abdominal pain , nausea , anorexia , pain , headache , vomit , diarrhea , dyspnea , constipation , cough increase , back pain , peripheral edema , dizziness , insomnia , anemia , fever , sweat , chest pain , rash . Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) recombinant , humanize , monoclonal antibody direct vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . This antibody block bind ligand VEGF receptor . VEGF know play pivotal role tumor angiogenesis significant mitogenic stimulus arterial , venous , lymphatic endothelial cell . It induce vascular permeability essential extracellular remodel serve endothelial cell survival factor . Phase III study 1st line colorectal cancer , 2nd line colorectal cancer , 1st line breast cancer , 1st line non-small cell lung cancer demonstrate clinical benefit term overall survival , progression free survival , tumor response [ Refs.. HH NEJM , A Sandler ASCO2005 , L Miller ASCO 2005 ] . Efficacy also note phase II study renal cell , ovarian , glioma , tumor type . Side effect bevacizumab include approximately 10-20 % rate hypertension require anti-hypertensives , uncommon aterial thromboembolilc event ( myocardial infarction , unstable angina , cerebrovascular event , transient ischemic attack , etc ) background rate increase approximately 1-2 % 2-4 % , approximately 1-2 % risk GI perforation . Aside pivotal phase III colorectal cancer study , dose bevacizumab use clinical trial 10mg/kg biweekly . A dose bevacizumab 10 mg/kg use study consistent dosing use ongoing plan bevacizumab study show , compare low dos , comparable improve activity . Based available data , reasonable hypothesis combination ABT-510 bevacizumab safe potentially efficacious anti-angiogenesis strategy treatment adult solid tumor . This combination may utility directly may prove useful subsequently combine anti-angiogenic agent standard chemotherapy regimen . An important aspect propose study inclusion clinical dermal wound angiogenesis assay help quantify characterize anti-angiogenic contribution agent combination . Therefore , study mean provide important safety information combination , also insight additive mechanistic effect two agent different mechanisms action .</detailed_description>

Women childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( either surgical sterilization ; approve hormonal contraceptive birth control pill , DepoProvera , Lupron Depot ; barrier method condom diaphragm along spermicide ; IUD ) . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician study PI immediately . Patients willing use adequate contraception three month follow discontinuation study drug . The patient able selfadminister caregiver reliably administer subcutaneous injection . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients radiation therapy , hormonal therapy , biologic therapy , chemotherapy cancer within 21 day prior Day 1 study . Patients prostate cancer already receive androgen deprivation therapy ( ie . leuprolide goserelin ) long 3 month may continue therapy study . Patients receive investigational agent within 28 day prior Day 1 study . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis , uncertain risk regimen tumor bleeding , patient often develop progressive neurological dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients primary malignancy know metastasize brain ( lung cancer , breast cancer , renal cell cancer , , sarcoma , carcinoma unknown primary , melanoma , head neck cancer ) patient symptoms brain metastasis brain MRI within 28 day enrollment confirm absence CNS metastasis . Contrast CT acceptable patient unable undergo brain MRI . Patients poorly control clinically significant atherosclerotic vascular disease include CHF NY Heart Class &gt; 2 ( see Appendix B ) ; angina require nitrate ; MI , CVA , TIA , angioplasty , cardiac vascular stenting past 6 month ; ventricular arrhythmia require medication . History intolerance prior treatment bevacizumab ABT510 . Prior treatment agent otherwise permit . Poorly control hypertension ( &gt; 160/100 ) . Initiation adjustment BP medication permit prior study entry provide patient 3 consecutive BP reading less 150/90 mmHg separate minimum 24 hour . These reading collect prior first skin biopsy . History thrombosis within 3 month prior enrollment current use therapeutic anticoagulation . Prophylactic lowdose anticoagulation indwell catheter permit ; PT/PTT must within normal limit . Use antiplatelet agent aspirin ( &lt; 325 mg/day ) standard dose NSAIDs . Presence bleed diathesis , coagulopathy , major bleed event acute GI bleed require transfusion invasive intervention hemoptysis great 1 tablespoon within 6 month prior Day 1 study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit safety compliance study requirement .
