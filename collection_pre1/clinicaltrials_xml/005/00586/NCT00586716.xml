	<detailed_description>The purpose study test clinical laboratory observation IVIG therapy highly sensitized patient . We study effect patient treat IVIG Cytogam combination plasmaphoresis modulate immune response highly sensitized patient . There two arm study , one IVIG administer patient live donor positive crossmatch result , another intravenous immune globulin administer patient live donor PRA great 30 % 3 consecutive month crossmatch cadaveric donor kidney transplant wait list . The goal convert positive crossmatch compatible crossmatch would allow living related transplant take place shorten time transplant wait list .</detailed_description>
