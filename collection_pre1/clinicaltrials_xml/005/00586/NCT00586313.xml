	<detailed_description>Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD ) alcohol-like liver disease occur individual consume excessive alcohol . Similar alcohol-induced liver disease , NAFLD encompass spectrum liver damage , range non-alcoholic fatty liver ( NAFL ) clinically benign end spectrum cirrhosis opposite extreme liver-related morbidity mortality occur . In NAFL , liver steatotic generally healthy . Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) severe form liver damage NAFL increase hepatocyte death addition steatosis . The liver injury NASH trigger repair response sometimes lead cirrhosis.1-3 The architecture cirrhotic liver distort regenerate nodule fibrous tissue . Cirrhosis result fibrosis disrupts normal liver architecture , carve parenchyma nodule hepatocytes separate band connective tissue . Some individual NAFLD develop cirrhosis . As type liver disease , progression advance stage liver damage NAFLD generally think require many year , perhaps decade . Because liver-related morbidity mortality occur cirrhotic individual , researcher try understand basis inter-individual difference tendency develop cirrhosis . Exiting blood test image modality limited sensitivity detect liver steatosis , steatohepatitis cirrhosis . In addition , test distinguish NAFLD cause fatty liver disease . Thus , present time , NAFLD diagnosis exclusion . Results two large population-based study extremely useful define prevalence NAFLD general US adult population.4,5 The Dallas Heart Study use liver image assess prevalence fatty liver 2200 adult . The overall prevalence fatty liver study 31 % range 24-45 % population demonstrate hepatic steatosis . Of note , individual elevate liver fat content demonstrate aminotransferase elevation . The latter finding help explain NHANES III , another large population-based study , suggest much low prevalence NAFLD general US adult population . In NHANES III , serum aminotransferase use assess NAFLD prevalence 15,000 adult approach suggest 5.5 % population NAFLD . Based result Dallas Heart Study likely approach use NHANES III underestimate true prevalence NAFLD US adult . In case , net result two study suggest 5.5 31 % adult US population NAFLD . To appreciate significance finding , useful compare prevalence NAFLD hepatitis C , think exist 1.8 % US population.6 NAFLD three ten time common hepatitis C-related liver disease US . Population-based study case series demonstrate strong association NAFLD several condition , include obesity , type 2 diabetes , dyslipidemia , comprise metabolic syndrome.4,5,7-13 This suggest prevalence NAFLD likely much great high risk population . Studies morbidly obese patient undergo gastric bypass surgery support concept . In individual , liver disease unsuspected pre-operatively . However , intraoperative liver biopsy consistently demonstrate NAFLD . In four recent series include 600 subject , prevalence NAFL ( steatosis ) range 30-90 % NASH ( steatohepatitis ) document 33-42 % . Thus , two-thirds morbidly obese patient undergo gastric bypass surgery NAFL/NASH . Although overt manifestation portal hypertension likely exclude patient candidate elective abdominal surgery , four surgical series consistently identify individual hepatic fibrosis . Well-established cirrhosis relatively unusual , occur 1-2 % group . However , advanced fibrosis note 12 % third unexplained periportal fibrosis . There also high prevalence NAFLD high population patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . A recent survey 100 non-alcoholic patient type 2 diabetes use ultrasonography screen NAFLD demonstrate fatty liver half group . Subsequent liver biopsy reveal NAFL 12 % NASH 87 % ultrasonographic evidence fatty liver . Fibrosis cirrhosis note 20 % .14 In patient metabolic syndrome hyperlipidemia , fatty liver detect 50 % 95 adult use ultrasonography screen unsuspected hepatic steatosis.15 Similar type chronic liver disease , liver-related morbidity mortality dictate severity liver damage . This concept explain observation NAFL relatively benign prognosis , whereas NAFLD-related cirrhosis may complicate portal hypertension hepatocellular carcinoma , eventuate death liver disease.2 Studies disease.2 Studies US France independently demonstrate 3 easily-assessed clinical parameter identify individual cryptogenic hepatitis likely advanced fibrosis liver biopsy . These parameter older age ( great 45-50 year ) , overweight obese body mass index , type 2 diabetes . The probability bridge fibrosis cirrhosis liver biopsy approximately 66 % individual cryptogenic hepatitis old either overweight/obese diabetic.16,17 Identification individual NASH fibrosis important prognostic implication . Follow-up patient NASH fibrosis demonstrate almost 30 % individual become cirrhotic within 5-10 year . In contrast , 3 % individual milder form non-alcoholic fatty liver disease develop cirrhosis decade follow-up . Therefore , NASH fibrosis progress cirrhosis consistently rapidly simple NAFL.2,13 In order provide optimal therapy individual NAFLD , liver disease must diagnose . The diagnostic evaluation individual suspect NAFLD 3 goal . The first goal establish fatty liver disease etiology liver disease . Unfortunately , specific serologic marker NAFLD identify yet . Moreover , current diagnostic test NAFLD limitation . Standard image test ultrasonography CT scan , may under- over-estimate hepatic fat content.1,18 Moreover , detect liver fat abdominal imaging neither distinguish alcoholic- non-alcoholic-fatty liver disease , exclude type liver disease might co-exist hepatic steatosis . The second goal confirm specific type fatty liver disease , alcoholic fatty liver disease ( AFLD ) non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . These two entity distinguish histologic parameter assessment drink habit patient . The third arguably important , goal diagnostic work-up establish clinical severity prognosis liver disease . Because NAFLD common often generate manifestation liver disease , necessary high index suspicion identify individual might NAFLD . This include individual metabolic syndrome ( least 2 follow disorder : obesity , type 2 diabetes , hypertension dyslipidemia ) detection fatty liver image study abdomen . Imaging study laboratory test may point advanced liver disease early cirrhosis NAFLD without fibrosis reliably diagnose without liver biopsy . At time , liver biopsy remain `` gold standard '' stag severity liver damage NAFLD type chronic liver disease.2 This biopsy traditionally perform percutaneously without ultrasound guidance . Needle entry biopsy typically right lobe diaphragm rib right mid-axillary line . Alternatively , may do anterior approach leave lobe . However , potential limitation percutaneous biopsy include sample error19,20 ( may representative hepatic architecture ) complication ( pain , bleed puncture another organ , obtain liver tissue ) . Due anatomical consideration , patient even candidate liver biopsy percutaneous approach . In case , biopsy may perform transjugular method . This technique involve use conscious sedation follow needle access jugular vein . A wire pass heart branch hepatic vein guide needle biopsy liver . Similar percutaneous biopsy , procedure safe perform experienced operator . However , complication include neck hematoma , hepatic arteriovenous fistula , liver capsular puncture , intraperitoneal hemorrhage death report technique.21,22 Regardless approach , liver biopsy incurs monetary cost , include fee facility , equipment , hepatologist pathologist , well process tissue sample . On hand , expense liver biopsy roughly equivalent magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , sensitive radiologic test quantify liver fat , fat ; MRI inferior biopsy detect liver inflammation fibrosis.23 Alternative method acquisition core biopsy liver may helpful patient percutaneous transjugular liver biopsy would difficult , risky contraindicate . Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) -guided fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) use 15 year Indiana University Medical Center hospital sample lymph node mass posterior mediastinum , upper abdomen pelvis.24-29 In 2003 , publish experience EUS-FNA liver use 22-gauge needle 77 patient without complication date remain large series report literature.30 Since report , perform procedure 100 patient also without know complication ( publish ) . In 2003 , FDA approve development 19-gauge Trucut biopsy ( TCB ) device ( Wilson-Cook Medical , Inc. ; Winston-Salem , North Carolina ) provide histologic tissue sample use EUS . The initial report use device demonstrate safety utility biopsy major upper abdominal organ ( include liver ) swine model.31 Its subsequent use sample gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GISTs ) , pancreatic mass mediastinal lymph node human also reported.312-35 We also study use diagnosis nonfocal chronic pancreatitis.36 At Indiana University , EUS group use device 30 patient protocol various accepted indication without know complication ( publish ) . The use EUS-TCBdevice liver biopsy report abstract form two patient suspect metastatic malignancy.37 No complication report two patient . Its use suspect benign disease liver report date .</detailed_description>
