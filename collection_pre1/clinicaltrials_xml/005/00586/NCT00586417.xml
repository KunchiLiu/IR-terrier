	<detailed_description>Many physiological process normal growth , development , injury , repair critical tumor growth progression . Usually process deregulate , allow potential tumor selectivity target many process . In many case , alter host stromal tissue critical many step cancer progression . Stromal endothelial cell fibroblast produce many tumor growth factor , act paracrine loop . In addition , component host tissue matrix plasma protein also help promote inhibit tumor growth . These topic extensively review . A large number target therapy cancer also various stage clinical development . Due likely minimal toxicity modest single agent activity agent , determine optimal dose schedule agent depend upon identification biomarkers demonstrate proof target inhibition and/or characterize downstream consequence inhibition . Despite often robust durable clinical response , essentially patient treat bevacizumab progress , imply primary acquire resistance , . Treatment related change VEGF ligands receptor report response anti-VEGF therapy preclinical model . Treatment related change also note many additional angiogenic factor , include PDGF , bFGF , IGF , show potentially mediate sensitivity resistance anti-VEGF therapy . Despite known importance numerous angiogenic factor preclinical model patient , yet broad systematic evaluation either baseline treatment relate change multiple angiogenic factor response bevacizumab . Similar information also lack essentially target therapy . Biomarkers well understand mechanisms action , primary acquire resistance , toxicity agent urgently need . The topic extensively review consider priority NCI . The need biomarkers critical give increase number permutation target therapeutic need biomarkers guide patient treatment selection clinical trial general use anti-cancer therapy . Assay optimization define expect value marker panel marker critical use assay large therapeutic clinical trial design target specific patient population . In addition , understand biology regulation biomarkers related tumor growth tumor angiogenesis also important . Most candidate biomarkers cellular growth factor , involved tumor promotion growth , also normal growth development normal abnormal tissue response injury . The primary purpose propose project help refine new biomarkers new evolve technology ass .</detailed_description>
