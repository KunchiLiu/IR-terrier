	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 , open-label , single-center , dose-escalating study pediatric patient refractory recurrent solid tumor . Patients register 1 2 stratum , depend upon presence bone marrow metastases previous treatment intensive myelosuppression therapy . Patients receive Karenitecin along cyclophosphamide daily 5 consecutive day , every 21 day ( 1 treatment cycle ) . Treatment may continue 20 cycle , long continue evidence clinical benefit absence unacceptable toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , open-label , dose-escalating study karenitecin plus cyclophosphamide treatment pediatric patient refractory recurrent solid tumor . All patient must histologically document diagnosis cancer ( solid tumor ) refractory conventional therapeutic modality curative treatment exists . Approximately 50 patient register study one 2 stratum . Stratum 1 include patient know bone marrow metastasis prior intensive myelosuppression therapy . Stratum 2 include patient without previous intensive myelosuppressive therapy bone marrow metastasis . Each stratum accrue patient independently . The primary endpoint study MTD determine recommend Phase 2 dose level study . The MTD determine stratum independently . There 3 define period study : Period I ( Screening Registration ) Period II ( Active Treatment ) : An accelerated titration dose escalation design use study . Dose escalation function independently stratum . Period III ( End Study ) : Once treatment discontinue , patient undergo end-of-study procedure .</detailed_description>
