	<brief_summary>Evaluate safety natural killer ( NK ) cell infusion use CD56 monoclonal antibody select Miltenyi Biotec system follow nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) match donor . This pilot study evaluate toxicity include mortality , occurrence acute graft versus host disease severe toxicity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Trial NK DLI From 6/6 HLA Matched Family Member Following Nonmyeloablative ASCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use non-selected donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLIs ) ( help early immune recovery induce antitumor response ) follow nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) also complicate risk acute graft versus host disease ( aGVHD ) 30-40 % patient experience grade III-IV aGVHD . Data suggest use natural killer ( NK ) cell ( instead nonselected DLIs ) setting may mediate graft versus tumor ( GVT ) effect independently aGVHD . This pilot study design evaluate efficacy toxicity donor natural killer ( NK ) cell selection infusion follow nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) match donor .</detailed_description>
