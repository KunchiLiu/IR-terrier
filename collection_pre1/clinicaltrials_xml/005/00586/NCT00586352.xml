	<brief_summary>Inflammatory bowel disease , include Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis , disease gastrointestinal tract lead symptom abdominal pain , diarrhea , growth disturbance . Crohn 's disease chronic inflammatory process may affect part gastrointestinal tract , whereas ulcerative colitis typically present colon . Children inflammatory bowel disease frequently suffer disturbance growth , may continue adulthood result alter growth outcome . The metabolic response inflammatory bowel disease , include increase protein breakdown decrease protein synthesis may play significant role result malnutrition growth failure child inflammatory bowel disease suffer . The purpose study compare rate protein synthesis within mucosal line gastrointestinal tract child Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis child normal endoscopic examination . By compare child inflammatory bowel disease normal child , begin determine alteration protein metabolism within line gastrointestinal tract affect whole body protein metabolism , consequent effect growth . In patient diagnose Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis , follow-up study conduct two week follow initiation steroid therapy determine effect protein metabolism . We hypothesize child active inflammatory bowel disease increase rate protein synthesis line gastrointestinal tract patient normal endoscopy , increase protein breakdown protein synthesis improve follow steroid therapy child newly diagnose inflammatory bowel disease .</brief_summary>
