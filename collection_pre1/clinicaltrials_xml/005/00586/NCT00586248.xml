	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Pacemaker Interference From Peripheral Nerve Stimulator Regional Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principle nerve stimulation technique consist use battery power peripheral nerve stimulator generate electrical stimulus insulate needle appropriate anatomical location . The electrical impulse trigger depolarization insulate needle approach target nerve bundle . Braun Stimuplex , common nerve stimulator use peripheral nerve localization , currently use United States country . Previous study suggest reliable stimulator purpose peripheral nerve block . The operational manual however indicated device use patient cardiac pacemaker malfunction pacemaker may occur . Literature search topic pacemaker interference peripheral nerve stimulator show one case pacemaker interference cause activation nerve stimulator , result cardiac arrest patient fixed-rate ventricular pacemaker . Studies case report suggest unipolar electrode seem susceptible interference electrosurgical equipment , TENS unit , spinal cord stimulators . Perhaps reason manufacturer peripheral nerve stimulator recommend use peripheral nerve stimulator patient pacemaker . With advancement modern pacemaker technology , experience ; interscalene nerve block peripheral nerve block use nerve stimulator perform patient pacemaker without notable interference pacemaker function perhaps initial recommendation peripheral nerve stimulator manufacturer modify . In prospective pilot study , propose evaluate effect leave interscalene stimulation ( likely scenario interfere pacemaker function ) vary configuration pacemaker lead ( unipolar vs. bipolar pacer lead configuration ) vary position positive electrode stimulator .</detailed_description>
