	<brief_summary>Patients mantle cell lymphoma grave prognosis . They usually initial response therapy , however progress early course disease poor survival . We hypothesize emergence drug resistance responsible early failure therapy therefore intensive therapy induction follow high dose therapy immediately may produce good outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensive Induction Therapy Followed High Dose Chemo BM Transplant Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects undergo induction regimen consist 1 cycle cytarabine ( 3 gm/m2 Intravenously 1 hour every 12 hour 8 total dos ) mitoxantrone ( 10 mg/m2/d intravenously [ IV ] 30 minute daily day 1 , 2 , 3 ) . This combined Alemtuzumab ( anti-CD52 antibody ) 6-8 week . If , one cycle , subject progression disease note physical exam radiographic scan , proceed stem cell mobilization cyclophosphamide . This immediately follow high dose therapy stem cell support . Following count recovery , rituximab use 8 total dos consolidation therapy . Involved field irradiation may give post-transplant localized bulky disease well . Day -6 : Carmustine ( BCNU ) : 15 mg/kg ( 550 mg/m2 ) IV 2 hr . Day -4 : Etoposide Day -2 : Cyclophosphamide 100 mg/kg 1 liter D5W 2 hour .</detailed_description>
