	<brief_title>Developing Computer Based Treatments Addiction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This next part project National Institute Drug Abuse-funded R01 treatment development study purpose develop computer-based augmentation standard drug counsel cocaine dependence . This project receive additional funding NIDA . Specifically , aim next part proposal develop manualize cue-exposure base cocaine treatment use virtual reality ( VR ) base cue exposure/extinction software cellular phone-based computerized extinction reminder ( CER ) technology use high-risk situation outside treatment session . We enroll total 270 cocaine dependent subject order meet target goal 180 subject treatment . This randomized clinical trial conduct order determine acceptability feasibility treatment subject therapist , obtain treatment outcome effect size estimate . Specifically , next stage study , 180 cocaine dependent individual randomly assign receive NIDA approve Individual/Group Drug Counseling ( I/GDC ) cocaine treatment I/GDC plus VR/CER . Matching treatment group base age , sex , severity crack use ( use Addiction Severity Index ) , presence absence antisocial personality disorder . Treatment assignment conduct use computerized urn match program off-site study statistician . Current psychiatric diagnosis assess , change crack use . Comprehensive assessment conduct treatment baseline , six-month twelve-month follow-up . To measure outcome , substance use assess via self-report urinary analysis three time weekly 24 week active treatment weekly six month twelve month follow-up assessment . This new large part project follow work conduct NIDA-funded pilot project past four year , develop complementary intervention . In preliminary study ( Phase I a/b ) , conduct focus group , open trial , small randomize control trial ( n = 53 ) demonstrate promise novel intervention . The pilot phase I a/b portion enrol 171 subject ( sign consent ) Duke . 19 53 complete treatment portion . During Phase 1a , VR CER technology develop refine use two small open clinical trial . At conclusion Phase 1a , treatment manual detail rationale parameter VR CER technology complete . Next , mention , Phase Ib pilot randomize clinical trial conduct order determine acceptability feasibility treatment patient therapist , obtain treatment outcome effect size estimate .</detailed_description>
