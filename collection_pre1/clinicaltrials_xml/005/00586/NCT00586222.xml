	<brief_title>Omega 3 Fatty Acid Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bipolar disorder ( BP ) chronic , complex highly heterogeneous disease unrecognized misdiagnosed prepubertal child adolescent . It one disable form childhood psychopathology carry strike human economic cost . A high percentage child adolescent BP respond poorly exist treatment . There significant need study identify developmentally sensitive target novel therapeutic compound truly disable illness . A grow range novel therapeutic option treatment BP investigation . Highly unsaturated fatty acid omega-3 fatty acid among novel therapeutic compound consider treatment adult patient BP . However , mood-stabilizing efficacy neurometabolic effect naturally occur dietary component examine pediatric patient BP . The objective study identify magnetic resonance spectroscopic characteristic adolescent BP double-blind , placebo control combined omega-3 fatty omega -6 fatty acid trial . We compare spectroscopic finding BP group individually match healthy comparison subject omega-3/omega-6 fatty acid treatment . We identify well-described cohort adolescent ( age : 12-18 ) BP without catatonic feature , psychotic feature , psychiatric comorbidity . Comorbidity ADHD allow since might separate phenotype pediatric BP . We analyze difference BP subject comorbid ADHD , BP subject without ADHD . We evaluate subject novel magnetic resonance imaging technique , Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging ( MRSI ) . We use high-field 3T magnet perform MRSI acquisition , apply tissue volume correction technique compare absolute metabolite concentration rather metabolite ratio . Previous study find pronounced abnormality frontal lobe , cingulate cortex , thalamus basal ganglia patient BP . Thus , region interest study include anatomical area special emphasis give prefrontal cortex anterior cingulate cortex . To knowledge , first study examine omega-3 fatty acid induce change develop brain vivo . The long-term goal research group identify developmentally sensitive , trait state relate magnetic resonance spectroscopic marker pediatric BP . The preliminary data obtain application use design large scale , follow-up study examine whether alteration brain metabolite measure clinical state trait marker determine developmental variability pattern metabolic abnormality . Such knowledge provide powerful insight developmentally sensitive targeted pharmacological intervention . Studying bipolar disorder early course important minimize potentially confound factor , effect long-term medication use neurodegeneration relate chronic illness course substance abuse . Based exist literature , hypothesize increase myoinositol level detect region interest adolescent BP comparison healthy control .</detailed_description>
