	<brief_title>The Study Barrett 's Esophagus : What Are Factors Progression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Barrett 's esophagus ( BE ) define change esophageal mucosa normal squamous epithelium columnar epithelium intestinal metaplasia ( 1 ) . There compel evidence BE precursor lesion adenocarcinoma esophagus ( 2 ) . There also evidence prevalence BE much high initially suspect , true incidence rate cancer patient BE much low previously estimate . Endoscopic surveillance patient BE likely cost effective , save many life . Therefore , important understand patient BE likely progress malignancy , equally important determine patient likely progress.Because progression uncommon event , definitive study natural history include evaluation numerous risk factor require large number patient , accomplish context multicenter study . This model useful tool lead reduction overall health care cost . An Opportunity Generate Essential Knowledge Intervention . We establish initial network investigator interest 'Barrett 's Esophagus Study ' ( long term , longitudinal , prospective study ) collect preliminary data patient BE . To date , 1376 patient 4 center enter central databank . We present preliminary data incidence prevalence rate high-grade dysplasia cancer national meeting . We propose creation formal consortium perform cohort study ultimate primary aim define risk factor development high-grade dysplasia adenocarcinoma patient BE . Such multi-center , prospective , cohort , multi-disciplinary approach BE endorse `` NIH PRG stomach esophageal cancer '' ( May 2002 ) . BACKGROUND &amp; CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Barrett 's Esophagus pre-malignant lesion esophageal adenocarcinoma - Condition Rapidly Increasing Incidence . Patients BE increase risk development esophageal adenocarcinoma esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma . Adenocarcinoma esophagus believe arise BE step-wise progression low-grade dysplasia high-grade dysplasia , finally lead frank adenocarcinoma ( 4,5 ) . The cost effectiveness surveillance endoscopy patient BE sensitive incidence cancer ( 11 ) . The exact incidence adenocarcinoma patient BE know report vary 1 50 patient-years follow 1 285 patient-years follow ( 18-22 ) . The published incidence data exist cohort patient BE influence small number patient evaluate , short duration follow-up well demographic population study ( e.g . old patient , male sex ) . To date , maximum number patient include publish study determine incidence adenocarcinoma 327 patient ( 23,24 ) . The ultimate goal propose study establish large cohort patient BE address issue incidence , progression risk factor influence progression . Such approach recently endorse `` NIH 2002 PRG stomach esophageal cancer '' . Factors predict development dysplasia cancer BE patient unknown . A possible factor associate esophageal adenocarcinoma , study BE patient . These include GERD symptom , obesity , diet , smoking , prior cholecystectomy , drug H pylorus infection ( negative association ) ( 25-36 ) . The presence hiatal hernia BE length associate dysplasia cancer development BE patient preliminary single center study ( 37 ) . Reflux symptom also report significantly prevalent among parent sibling patient BE esophageal adenocarcinoma spouse control relatives ( 38 ) . A uncontrolled report provide conflict result role anti-reflux surgery use acid suppressive medication ( proton pump inhibitor , H2 receptor antagonist ) effect neoplastic progression BE patient ( 39-43 ) . However , study date BE patient limit small sample size , univariate analysis , short duration follow-up , lack adjustment confound variable etc . In proposed study , risk factor mechanisms capture data site data transfer main study database discuss implement . Sample size calculation appropriate univariate multiple logistic regression analysis perform . Proposed Study Fill Significant Gaps Knowledge . In recent `` NIH PRG stomach esophageal cancer ( May 2002 ) '' workshop sponsor NIH &amp; The American Digestive Health Foundation endoscopic priority ( 44 ) , expert field acknowledge need multi-center , longitudinal , study significant gap knowledge base BE include : 1 . Risk stratification cancer risk 2 . Appropriate method surveillance technique identify dysplasia 3 . Frequency benefit surveillance 4 . Optimal management BE acid suppression endoscopic reversal techniques The ultimate goal BE Study address issue # 1 # 3 i.e . risk stratification Barrett 's patient , develop large , multi-site database , prepare way future study address key issue . The information gain clinically useful . We define natural history progression BE patient determine factor involve progression high-grade dysplasia cancer . The potentially unique answer obtain study would major clinical relevance - Defining natural history dysplasia/cancer BE patient identify risk factor involve progression dysplasia/cancer . - Helping clarify predisposes small subset BE patient develop dysplasia/cancer . Rigorous examination number risk factor may define patient group , thereby focus limit health care resource patient subset increase risk development dysplasia/cancer - `` reduction health care cost '' - Potential change current costly clinical practice endoscopic surveillance BE patient , limit surveillance 'high-risk group ' - `` improve clinical decision making '' - Providing well accurate information BE patient regard 'true ' risk dysplasia cancer . PRELIMINARY STUDIES At time , preliminary data collect 4 participating center , merge one single databank . These preliminary result present plenary session ( 45,46 ) American Gastroenterological Association ( AGA ) annual meeting Atlanta , GA ( May 2001 ) American College Gastroenterology ( ACG ) annual meeting Las Vegas , NV ( October 2001 ) , indicate common interest amongst investigator capability work together . Distribution Degree Dysplasia . From four participate center , 1376 patient meet study criterion least one endoscopy biopsy reveal intestinal metaplasia , thus confirm diagnosis BE . At initial endoscopy , distribution dysplasia follow : Diagnosis Number pt . Prevalence Low-grade dysplasia ( LGD ) 101 7.3 % High-grade dysplasia ( HGD ) 42 3 % Esophageal adenocarcinoma 91 6.7 % Incidence progression low-grade dysplasia , high-grade dysplasia esophageal adenocarcinoma . 1376 patient enrol prevalence phase study . To date , 618 patient ( 95 % Caucasians , 14 % Females ) follow-up endoscopic procedure examine incidence dysplasia/cancer . They follow total 2546 patient-years ; mean follow 4.12 patient-years ( range : 1-22.5 yr ) . Twelve patient develop cancer follow cancer incidence 1 212 patient-years follow 0.5 % per year . The mean time development cancer 5.3 yr ( range : 2.4-11.2 yr ) . Of interest , 7 12 patient high-grade dysplasia cancer development 2 low-grade dysplasia ; 3 develop cancer BE without dysplasia document point . 22 patient develop high-grade dysplasia follow estimate high-grade dysplasia incidence 1 116 patient-years follow 0.9 % per year . The mean time high-grade dysplasia development 3.8 yr ( range : 1.2-7.9 yr ) . 11 22 patient develop high-grade dysplasia BE without document dysplasia , whereas remain 11 go low-grade dysplasia high-grade dysplasia . Risk Factors BE adenocarcinoma . The epidemiology natural history BE poorly study . Some factor associate increase risk esophageal adenocarcinoma general population ( see Table 1 ) , risk factor progression BE patient clear . A number risk factor suggest factor risk BE patient include age , gender , ethnicity , GERD symptom , family history BE/cancer , alcohol , tobacco , dietary factor ( fat intake , cereal fiber , calcium etc . ) acid suppressive medication , biomarkers , genetic marker etc . Given long list possible risk factor , propose convene panel expert plan committee serve jury order determine potential risk factor measure prospective study measure . This would narrow refine list risk factor prospective study . There lot purport risk factor evaluate . Thus , long list ( see ) potential factor risk patient BE associate progression dysplasia and/or cancer : ( 1 ) Age ( 2 ) Gender ( 3 ) Ethnicity ( 4 ) Reflux symptom ( 5 ) Smoking ( 6 ) Alcohol ( 7 ) Dietary fat ( 8 ) Dietary fiber , vegetable , fruit ( 9 ) Dietary calcium ( 10 ) Obesity ( 11 ) Family history reflux , BE esophageal cancer ( 12 ) Use aspirin , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( 13 ) Use low esophageal sphincter relax medication ( 14 ) Use acid suppressive medication ( 15 ) Cholecystectomy ( 16 ) Anti-reflux surgery ( fundoplication ) ( 17 ) Length BE ( 18 ) Hiatal hernia ( 19 ) Helicobacter pylori infection ( 20 ) Low-grade dysplasia biopsy This proposal make feasible narrow factor study prospective trial . Statistical Analysis Prevalence incidence rate : We expect increase baseline-screened population 1376 2500 individual final study . The number patient expect enroll year calculate expect number new prevalence case use 9.7 % prevalence rate preliminary study data estimate . In preliminary study date 618 patient least one follow-up visit . Including remain 700 patient preliminary study assume 10 % rate loss follow , 6100-7450 patient year follow . The expected number new incidence case use 1.3 % incidence rate preliminary study data estimate .</detailed_description>
