	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , melphalan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Sorafenib may also make tumor cell sensitive melphalan . Giving sorafenib together isolated limb infusion melphalan may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose sorafenib give together isolated limb infusion melphalan treat patient stage III melanoma arm leg .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Isolated Limb Infusion Melphalan Treating Patients With Stage III Melanoma Arm Leg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine dose-limiting toxicity maximum tolerate dose systemic sorafenib tosylate combination regionally administer melphalan isolate limb infusion patient stage IIIB IIIC intransit extremity melanoma . Secondary - To characterize safety tolerability regimen patient . - To assess antitumor activity regimen , evidence best overall response duration response , patient . - To characterize duration progression-free survival patient . - To characterize pharmacokinetics melphalan . - To assess alteration select gene protein expression profile follow treatment . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study sorafenib tosylate . Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily day 1-14 melphalan via isolated limb infusion upper low extremity day 8 . Patients undergo tumor biopsy baseline week 2 12 gene expression analysis western blot analysis . Patients also undergo blood sample collection periodically pharmacokinetic analysis melphalan . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
