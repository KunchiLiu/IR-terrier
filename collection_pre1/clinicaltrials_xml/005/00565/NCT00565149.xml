	<brief_title>PROOF : PROtein OverFeeding Effect Body Weight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When body weight increase , expenditure energy increase mechanism dissipate excess calorie . The role diet composition over-feeding/energy dissipation human unknown . We propose : 1 . High low protein diet result less weight gain compare moderate protein diet 56d high fat overfeed . 2 . Increase energy expenditure spontaneous physical activity , adjust lean fat mass great high low protein diet compare moderate protein diet . 3. average size fat cell pattern gene express adipose tissue , skeletal muscle , peripheral blood mononuclear cell `` predict '' group subject gain weight ( fat mass ) independent level protein diet .</detailed_description>
