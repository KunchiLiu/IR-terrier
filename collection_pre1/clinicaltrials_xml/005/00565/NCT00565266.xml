	<brief_summary>Typically , people asthma initially prescribe low dose inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) medication control asthma symptom . If low dose ICS ineffective controlling symptom , addition second controller medication recommend . This study examine effectiveness medication tiotropium bromide combine low dose ICS maintain asthma control people moderately severe asthma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Asthma Clinical Research Network ( ACRN ) Trial - Tiotropium Bromide Alternative Increased Inhaled Corticosteroid Patients Inadequately Controlled Lower Dose Inhaled Corticosteroid ( TALC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>National international asthma treatment guideline recommend ICS initial controller therapy people asthma need daily treatment controller medication . If treatment low moderate dos ICS sufficient gain maintain asthma control , current guideline recommend add second controller medication rather increase dose ICS . Current option second medication include long-acting beta-agonist , leukotriene modifier , theophylline . It possible medication , yet test , could fill role second controller medication . Tiotropium bromide medication use treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . It work relax open air passage lung make breathe easy . For people asthma , addition tiotropium bromide may good option second controller medication . The purpose study determine combine tiotropium bromide low dose ICS effective double dose ICS people moderately severe asthma . This study also examine whether addition tiotropium bromide low dose ICS effective addition long-acting beta-agonist maintain asthma control . This study begin 4-week run-in period participant monitor use inhaler contain low dose ICS medication . Next , participant assign take part either TALC study Best Adjustment Strategy Asthma Long Term ( BASALT ) study , separate Asthma Clinical Research Network ( ACRN ) study . All TALC participant undergo three 16-week treatment period , include follow : - tiotropium bromide inhalation powder 18 mcg daily ( Tio ) plus beclomethasone dipropionate 80 mcg twice daily ( 1xICS ) - salmeterol xinafoate inhalation powder 50 mcg twice daily ( LABA ) plus beclomethasone dipropionate 80 mcg twice daily ( 1xICS ) - beclomethasone dipropionate 160 mcg twice daily ( 2xICS ) The order three treatment period occur randomly assign participant . Each three 16-week treatment period consist 14 week treatment follow 2-week washout period , participant receive single ICS . Study visit occur baseline Weeks 2 4 4-week run-in period , Weeks 4 , 9 , 14 , 16 16-week treatment period . Spirometry test measure lung function occur study visit exhale nitric oxide test questionnaire assess asthma control symptoms occur visit . During study visit Week 4 run-in period Week 14 treatment period , lung function measurement , sputum collection , questionnaires assess asthma quality-of-life , measurement sleep daytime alertness occur . Participants also record asthma symptom , peak flow measurement , medication usage daily diary .</detailed_description>
