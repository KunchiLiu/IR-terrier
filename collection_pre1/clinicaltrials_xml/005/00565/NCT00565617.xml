	<brief_summary>Objective : Chronic epidural cortical stimulation ( ECS ) involve neurosurgical placement electric wire surface brain intermittent activation . Over time , ECS modulate local distal connect brain region . It currently apply motor cortex treat intractable pain . Because important role play medial prefrontal cortex mood regulation , goal study apply minimally invasive neurostimulation modality medial prefrontal cortex severely ill depressed subject fail attempt treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Severely Treatment Resistant Unipolar Depressed Subjects EpCS medial prefrontal cortex show significant decrease depression symptom 6 month post-implant compare baseline match control group treat electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) . Method : We enroll 5 subject severe refractory depression open trial 1 month placebo lead , 1 year . We also naturalistically follow 5 matched control patient treat ECT . Depressive cognitive symptom rat periodically assess safety efficacy procedure . Significance : This study take advantage expertise MUSC various neuromodulation technology begin answer crucial role target cortical brain stimulation potential role treatment resistant depression . This crucial pilot study might lead entire new class therapy depression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To eligible study , subject must meet following inclusion exclusion criterion : Subject diagnosis chronic ( ≥ two year ) recurrent ( multiple prior episode ) depression currently experience major depressive episode without psychotic feature define DSM IV criterion . Subjects may diagnosis unipolar bipolar depressive episode . Subject adequate response 4 adequate antidepressant treatment current depressive episode accord Antidepressant Treatment History Form ( ATHF ) ( Sackeim et al 1997 ) . Subject must age 21 80 . Baseline HDRS 24item ≥ 20 ( visit 1 week apart ) Subject must able complete evaluation need study include functional imaging scan . Subject must history one successful course ECT past . Subject must provide write informed consent . Subject stable antidepressant medication least 4 week baseline visit take antidepressant medication prior enter study . Subject must able remain current medication schedule first 19 week study . Subject medication know increase risk cortical stimulationinduced seizure . These include theophylline , stimulant medication , bupropion , supraphysiological dos thyroid supplement . The presence follow exclude subject study : The EpCS would ( investigator 's judgment ) pose unacceptable surgical medical risk patient ( include , limited : history serious cardiac pulmonary problem , stroke , significant brain malformation , progressive neurological disease , central nervous system disease injury , history seizure , previous neurosurgical procedure suspect brain tissue scar would increase risk seizure cervical fracture ) . Subject receive general anesthetic within last 30 day prior enrollment ( include ECT procedure ) . Subject currently another investigational device cardiac pacemaker , implantable defibrillator , implantable stimulator Subject anticoagulant drug , low platelet count PT PTT abnormality risk factor intraoperative postoperative bleeding Subject expect require full body magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) clinical study . Subject judge investigator acutely suicidal ( e.g . within 30 day prior EpCS implant , subject make suicide attempt gesture make specific plan preparation commit suicide ) . Subject history schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , psychotic disorder , active substance abuse dependence ( exception caffeine nicotine abuse ) current major depressive episode include psychotic feature ( commonly refer psychotic depression ) accord DSM IV criterion . Subject diagnosis dementia MiniMental State Exam ( MMSE ) ≤23 . Female subject positive urine pregnancy test . Subject positive urine drug screen current alcohol substance abuse nicotine caffeine .</criteria>
