	<brief_title>Treatments Recovery Hand Function Acute Stroke Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Loss hand function common stroke . Previous research suggest treatment focus movement hand time treatment electrically stimulate paretic ( weak ) hand muscle may help recovery hand function stroke . In study , two electrical stimulation treatment compare effectiveness restore hand movement hand function . One treatment stimulation , stimulation link movement contralateral hand . Study participant stroke survivor enrol still within first 6 month stroke . After enrol , hand movement function test . Then randomly assign one two treatment . Each treatment last 6 week . The treatment require participant perform specific exercise home total 2 hour every day come laboratory twice week study-related occupational therapy . At end 6-week treatment , test hand movement hand function repeat . The test repeat 1 3 month end treatment see effect treatment persist time go . Changes upper extremity impairment activity limitation compare across treatment group .</detailed_description>
