	<brief_summary>Acute rejection common problem kidney transplant . Rejection occur kidney recipient 's immune system try attack ( reject ) new kidney . Rejection typically often develop first month transplant . This single center study seek determine new combination anti-rejection medication , include recently FDA approve drug call Belatacept , well current standard anti-rejection drug regimen prevent rejection . Also determine whether new combination drug allow participant wean oral anti-rejection medication time . This study test safety effectiveness new investigational drug combination use alemtuzumab , belatacept , sirolimus give without donor bone marrow . This combination medicine test human . Alemtuzumab ( Campath ) approve use type white blood cell cancer , consider investigational transplant patient . Belatacept FDA approve studied transplant patient . Sirolimus ( Rapamune ) approve use transplant patient , use belatacept alemtuzumab investigational . In initial 20 subject enrol study , half test whether infusion bone marrow kidney donor would improve effect drug . This bone marrow infusion also consider investigational . Enrollment 20 additional subject begin January , 2013 . The donor bone marrow infusion eliminate . Enrollment open primary living decease donor kidney recipient . Enrollment close 8/12/2014 . Funding Source - FDA OOPD</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study single-center , open-label , proof concept study non-HLA-identical living decease donor renal transplant . The initial 20 subject randomize either receive/not receive single donor bone marrow infusion addition investigational combination alemtuzumab , belatacept , sirolimus . Since bone marrow infusion eliminate second group 20 subject , randomization require . All recipient second group 20 subject receive investigational combination alemtuzumab , belatacept , sirolimus . At time transplant , participant receive 3-hour IV infusion 30 mg. alemtuzumab . Participants receive combination sirolimus belatacept least 1 year . At time , eligible participant consent begin oral immunosuppressive withdrawal continue therapy study close . Sirolimus first wean halve dose and/or increase dose interval least 2-6 month period . After sirolimus discontinue , participant remain monthly IV belatacept monotherapy indefinitely . Follow-up continue least five year . If subject successfully wean oral immunosuppression participation trial , alternative therapy warrant . Since belatacept FDA approve , subject eligible continue therapy study participation end .</detailed_description>
