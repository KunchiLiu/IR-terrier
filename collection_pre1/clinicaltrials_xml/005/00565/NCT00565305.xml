	<brief_summary>The purpose research study understand effect complementary medicine therapy , Healing Touch quality life immunity patient receive treatment breast cancer . Healing Touch Holistic Therapy use adjunct medical treatment . The goal Healing Touch restore energy vitality body patient receive treatment cancer . Treatments include light touch specific point body well around body , increase well-being support body 's ability heal . Healing Touch show increase relaxation well-being decrease anxiety , pain , treatment side effect variety illnesses include cancer . Although Healing Touch frequently use cancer patient along medical treatment , little understood effect treatment immune system . The immune system know important body 's response fighting cancer . We study Healing Touch help u understand whether treatment effective support immune system breast cancer treatment Aim 1 . To evaluate effect heal touch ( HT ) intervention cellular immunity among early stage breast cancer patient radiotherapy . Aim 2 . To evaluate effect Healing Touch ( HT ) intervention cytokine associate radiation damage acute skin reaction early stage breast cancer patient radiotherapy . Aim 3 . To evaluate effect Healing Touch intervention fatigue mood early stage breast cancer patient radiation treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Breast cancer patient use Complementary Alternative Medicine ( CAM ) great proportion group cancer patient . The primary reason breast cancer patient cite use CAM strengthen immune system . Healing touch ( HT ) CAM treatment frequently use cancer patient reduce adverse side effect chemotherapy radiation enhance immunity . HT classify NIH `` biofield '' therapy effect propose secondary manipulation `` energy field '' around body patient . A recent meta-analysis demonstrate relatively large effect HT well-being physiological parameter , even brief treatment . However , date , data effect HT immune function among breast cancer patient treatment . This particularly important several immune parameter show long-term suppression alteration , particularly combine adjuvant chemotherapy radiation among breast cancer patient . Additionally , data effect HT common side effect breast cancer treatment include profound fatigue radiation-induced skin damage . Physiological mechanism underlie possible effect HT also poorly understood . This study design reduce knowledge gap examine HT affect cellular immune function biomarkers relate two problematic side effect breast cancer treatment , fatigue radiation-induced tissue damage . Effects subjective experience fatigue clinician rat skin damage also note . Participants 42 early stage breast cancer patient receive standard course radiotherapy follow breast conservation surgery mastectomy either chemotherapy The significance project follow . If positive effect demonstrate intermediate outcome immune parameter , marker radiation damage , and/or fatigue , follow-up study would warrant examine effect HT ) recurrence survival , b ) incidence long term side effect radiation , c ) quality life among breast cancer patient . Additionally , effect HT demonstrate , critical examination putative mechanisms action , use control effect attention , expectation , placebo effect warrant .</detailed_description>
