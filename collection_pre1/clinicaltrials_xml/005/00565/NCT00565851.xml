	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study carboplatin , paclitaxel gemcitabine hydrochloride give together without bevacizumab surgery see well work treat patient ovarian , epithelial , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer come back . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin , paclitaxel gemcitabine hydrochloride work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . It yet know whether combination chemotherapy effective give without bevacizumab surgery treat patient ovarian , epithelial , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin , Paclitaxel Gemcitabine Hydrochloride With Without Bevacizumab After Surgery Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian , Epithelial , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine surgical secondary cytoreduction addition adjuvant chemotherapy increase duration overall survival patient recurrent platinum sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer , peritoneal primary fallopian tube cancer . II . To determine addition bevacizumab second-line maintenance phase treatment increase duration overall survival relative second-line paclitaxel carboplatin alone patient recurrent platinum sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer , peritoneal primary fallopian tube cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine addition bevacizumab second-line maintenance phase treatment increase duration progression-free survival relative second-line paclitaxel carboplatin alone patient recurrent platinum sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer , peritoneal primary fallopian tube cancer . II . To prospectively determine incidence carboplatin paclitaxel hypersensitivity patient undergoing retreatment agent first recurrence therapy . III . To determine surgical secondary cytoreduction addition adjuvant chemotherapy increase quality life ( QOL ) patient recurrent platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer , peritoneal primary fallopian tube cancer , measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Ovarian ( FACT-O ) trial outcome index Rand Short Form ( SF ) -36 physical functioning scale . IV . To determine addition bevacizumab second-line maintenance phase treatment increase QOL relative second-line paclitaxel carboplatin alone patient recurrent platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian , peritoneal primary fallopian tube cancer . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define molecular biochemical profile associate duration progression-free survival platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian , peritoneal primary fallopian tube carcinoma treat combination chemotherapy without bevacizumab follow without maintenance bevacizumab therapy presence absence secondary surgical cytoreduction . II . To identify molecular determinant predict sensitivity resistance carboplatin paclitaxel without bevacizumab follow without maintenance bevacizumab therapy . III . To bank deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) whole blood research evaluate association single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) measure clinical outcome include overall survival , progression-free survival adverse event . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 4 treatment group . Patients candidate surgical cytoreduction ( i.e. , complete cytoreduction estimation investigator impossible medical infirmity precludes exploration debulking ) eligible receive chemotherapy randomization . Patients eligible surgery undergo abdominal exploration cytoreduction . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour docetaxel IV 1 hour carboplatin IV 60 minute day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive chemotherapy Arm I bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . ARM III : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 60 minute day 1 8 carboplatin Arm I . ARM IV : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV Arm III , bevacizumab IV carboplatin IV Arm II . In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients measurable disease achieve clinical response ( CR ) receive 6-8 course therapy . Patients stable disease partial regression receive maximum 8 course . Patients without measurable lesion determine compute tomography ( CT ) scan prior initiating study treatment continue therapy 6 course , cancer antigen ( CA ) -125 normalizes , 2 course beyond CA-125 normalization , whichever great . Patients Arm II receive maintenance regimen comprise bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute . Treatment bevacizumab alone repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , yearly 5 year .</detailed_description>
