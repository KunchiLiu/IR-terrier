	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Granulocyte-macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) Use Human IVF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Throughout development , embryo naturally expose large number cytokine growth factor present woman 's reproductive organ . A grow body evidence indicate factor play physiological role regulation normal development pre-implanted embryo factor therefore help increase implantation embryo subsequently ensure optimal development foetus placenta . The cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) show present female reproductive organ early pregnancy mouse , sheep , cow human . 2 ng/ml GM-CSF proven safe previous study present European Society Human Reproduction Embrylogy ( ESHRE ) congress 2007 ( A. Loft et al . 2007 ) . The present investigation ( DK001 ) knowledge first large prospective randomise vivo study human . Previous publication count one Korean pilotstudy 154 woman prospectively randomised culture medium without GM-CSF 2 ng/ml ( Kim et al. , 2001 ) , show significant effect GM-CSF embryo implantation rate . Based knowledge hypothesize culture human embryo presence GM-CSF significantly increase implantation rate also large population . This hypothesis test conduct multicentre , randomise , parallel group , double-blind , placebo-controlled study adaptive design , perform 14 study centre . Each patient participate study retrieval oocytes follow standard hormonal treatment 12th gestational week . Further follow-up performed pregnancy child bear . The test group include standard culture medium 2 ng/ml GM-CSF add time insemination , control group exact medium without addition . All procedure accord standard clinic , apply standard medium except patient randomise study medium use oocyte insemination , embryo culture transfer . Embryo transfer perform Day 3 . An interim analysis perform final sample size calculation .</detailed_description>
