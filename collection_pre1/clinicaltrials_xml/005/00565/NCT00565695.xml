	<brief_title>Evaluation Aspheric ReSTOR Intraocular Lens ( IOL ) After Routine Cataract Extraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cataract prevalent throughout world IOLs routinely implant extraction cataractous lens . It frequently perform surgery United States estimate 2-3 million procedure perform annually . With age population rise , well increase popularity refractive intraocular lens , number intraocular surgery continue rise . Over year , surgical technique evolve intracapsular extraction modern phacoemulsification . This development help evolution IOLs well . The IOLs advance extensively : different material design available , permit implantation small , sutureless incision . Traditional IOLs monofocal design provide vision one distance , typically far . Patients implanted traditional monofocal IOLs usually require glass near distance task read . The new multifocal IOLs offer possibility see well one distance , without glass contact . The AcrySof ReSTOR ( Alcon Laboratories ) use apodized diffractive technology — design respond wide small eye 's pupil might — provi de near , intermediate , distance vision . Clinical study use support March 2005 FDA approval show 80 % people receive lens use glass activity cataract surgery ; 84 % receive lens eye distance vision 20/25 good , near vision 20/32 better . Wavefront analysis technique currently use measure aberration entire optical system . The term aberration derive Latin ab-erratio , mean go offtrack deviate . Therefore , aberration difference exist ideal image would expect see luminous ray refract perfect optical system ( Snell 's law ) actually achieve . This technology widely use refractive surgery successful outcomes . With introduction wavefront analysis , new tool available re-design study performance IOLs . Regarding IOL design , use modify IOL partially compensate average spherical aberration . The goal improve ocular optical quality pseudophakic patient . Clinical result use aspheric monofocal IOLs confirm modification lead significant improvement , particularly contrast sensitivity , mesopic visual quality reduction high order aberration mainly spherical aberration compare spherical IOLs . The new aspheric ReSTOR IOL first single piece acrylic multifocal IOL available United States comparison regular ( spherical ) multifocal IOL necessary determine aspheric ReSTOR lens show improvement . The purpose study evaluate visual outcome patient satisfaction bilateral implantation aspheric ReSTOR multifocal intraocular lens ( IOL ) compare historical control group patient implant bilaterally spherical ReSTOR multifocal IOL .</detailed_description>
