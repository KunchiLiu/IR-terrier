	<brief_summary>The objective phase II trial test efficacy tolerance Bevacizumab MDS patient excess marrow blast evaluate impact Bevacizumab angiogenesis erythropoiesis . To limit myelotoxicity observe preliminary phase II study , Bevacizumab administrate initial dose 5 mg/kg . The primary endpoint response : Complete Remission ( CR ) , Partial Remission ( PR ) hematological improvement ( HI ) accord IWG criterion ( see appendix 3 ) . The secondary endpoint survival , response duration , side effect , evaluation angiogenesis ( bone marrow microvessel density , VEGF plasma level , VEGF mRNA expression , HIF-1alpha expression ) . The design study consist three study period : pre-treatment ( screen ) , treatment ( load maintenance ) , follow-up . All patient participate study least 12 week therapy , 4-week follow-up visit , long-term follow-up unless criterion plan unplanned early discontinuation meet .</brief_summary>
