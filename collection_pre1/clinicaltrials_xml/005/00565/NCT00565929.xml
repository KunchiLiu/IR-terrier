	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare body 's immune system react vaccine smallpox infection , call Modified Vaccinia Ankara ( MVA ) evaluate safety vaccine . Study participant include 24 adult , age 18-60 year , undergone stem cell transplant 2 year ago . Study procedure include physical exam , blood sample , heart activity assessment , urine sample . Participants assign 1 2 possible study vaccine group . The participant receive 1 2 possible vaccine dos placebo ( substance contain medication ) 28 day apart . Participants make least 8 visit clinic course study ; additional visit may need participant experience side effect vaccine . Participants may involve study related procedure 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In event smallpox outbreak , threat one , mass immunization vulnerable individual would take place . This would include person immunodeficiency see post Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ( HSCT ) . The current Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve smallpox vaccine ( Dryvax速 ) live replicate virus ( vaccinia ) contraindicate immunocompromised person close physical contact . The Modified Vaccinia Ankara ( MVA ) , specifically IMVAMUNE速 develop safe , less reactogenic vaccine smallpox . Study participant include 24 male female participant , 18 60 year age . This study assess safety , reactogenicity immunogenicity 2 dos MVA-BN ( IMVAMUNE速 ) give person undergo HSCT 2 year prior study participation . There 2 arm study , receive 2 dos 28 day apart either 1 x 10^7 1 x 10^8 tissue culture infectious dose 50 ( TCID50 ) . Each arm comprise 12 subject , 10 receive IMVAMUNE速 2 receive placebo double blind , randomize allocation . Subjects follow safety reactogenicity . Clinical assessment perform blood sample obtain sequentially safety immunogenicity determination . All subject complete memory aid 15 day vaccination record oral temperature note occurrence solicit unsolicited adverse event well medication use . Adverse event collect 56 day vaccination . Serious adverse event concomitant medication collect throughout entire study period . Study staff ass subject clinically day 14 28 vaccination day 42 , 56 , 84 , 180 . Hematology blood chemistry study include hemoglobin , white blood cell platelet count kidney liver function test obtain . Electrocardiogram Troponin I T obtain prior first vaccination day 14 28 immunization day 180 . Clinical laboratory assay conduct clinical laboratory Brigham Women 's Hospital Dana Farber Cancer Institute . The primary objective study determine safety reactogenicity MVA person undergo allogeneic HSCT 2 year prior study participation . The secondary objective study determine immunogenicity MVA person undergo HSCT 2 year prior study participation . Immunogenicity determine humoral immune response cell mediate immune response .</detailed_description>
