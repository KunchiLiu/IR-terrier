	<brief_title>Combination Study Capecitabine Erlotinib Concurrent With Radiotherapy Non-Operable Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over past several decade , 5-fluorouracil base chemoradiation cornerstone treatment locally advance non-operable pancreatic cancer . However , survival patient disappoint . The majority patient suffer either local progression metastatic disease . With availability Capecitabine , pilot study show drug convenient , tolerable safe combination radiation therapy . Capecitabine demonstrate superior anti-tumor activity 14 month median survival . However , small Phase I study survival benefit need validate large study . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) implicate tumor growth angiogenesis . Inhibiting EGFR Tarceva demonstrate effective treatment metastatic pancreatic cancer . Anti-epidermal growth factor therapy combination radiotherapy demonstrate efficacious solid tumor head neck cancer . We hypothesize combination Tarceva Capecitabine synergistic anti-tumor effect . Hence , improvement median survival could potentially achieve novel combination .</detailed_description>
