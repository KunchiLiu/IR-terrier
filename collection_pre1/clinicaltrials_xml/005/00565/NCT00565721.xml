	<criteria>Selection Subjects : The targeted subject population adult subject initial diagnosis recurrence tumour ≥2.5 cm diameter schedule undergo resection biopsy tumour result routine clinical treatment . General Inclusion Criteria Subjects : The subject ≥18 year old . The subject diagnostically image suspected primary metastatic tumour lesion ≥2.5 cm one follow type : highgrade glioma , include glioblastoma multiforme , anaplastic astrocytoma , anaplastic oligodendroglioma ; lung cancer , include small cell lung cancer nonsmall cell lung cancer ; H &amp; N tumour , include laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma , welldifferentiated thyroid oral cavity carcinoma ; sarcoma ; melanoma . The subject schedule undergo resection biopsy ≥2.5 cm target tumour result routine clinical treatment . The subject schedule undergo receive standard care diagnostic imaging workup ( follow study centre 's routine procedure ) , e.g .
