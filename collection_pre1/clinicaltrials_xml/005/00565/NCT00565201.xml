	<brief_summary>The present study design determine safety effectiveness injection BOTOX® spastic muscle arm hand compare injection saline ( would nothing ) combine rehabilitation therapy improvement active function task post-stroke patient . Injections target reduce common spasticity pattern arm hand include : bent elbow , palm forearm , bent wrist , thumb-in-palm , clenched fist , hand deformity . This do Emory University . Neither doctor injecting drug subject receive drug know get BOTOX® saline . Which type injection subject receive completely randomize ( like flip coin ) . All subject rehabilitation therapy injection . Subjects assess total 5 schedule visit ( qualification ( Week 1 ) , Injection ( Week 2 ) , Evaluations Weeks 8 , 10 , 14 . All subject receive rehabilitation therapy immediately injections 1 hour day , 3-5 time week , 4 week . The result project provide valuable data ability BOTOX® physical rehabilitation provide effective treatment spastic muscle arm hand stroke . This project potential increase availability effective rehabilitation technique patient stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation BOTOX® With Rehabilitation Therapy Treatment Wrist Hand Spasticity Post-Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After stroke , patient commonly experience tightness affect arm wrist hand muscle overactivity call spasticity . Spasticity difficult manage one type treatment . Usual treatment spasticity effective may produce unwanted side effect . Untreated spasticity may result muscular problem decrease patient 's general ability function thus affect his/her quality life . BOTOX® , botulinum toxin type A produce Clostridium botulinum , block certain chemical cause spasticity . With appropriate injection BOTOX® correct muscle , change tightness muscle temporarily . Published report indicate several hundred adult patient arm and/or leg spasticity various cause ( e.g. , poststroke , multiple sclerosis traumatic brain injury ) benefit injection BOTOX® spastic muscle . The efficacy BOTOX® patient post-stroke spasticity arm hand demonstrate seven phase 2 placebo-controlled study two phase 3 study . The present study design determine safety effectiveness injection BOTOX® spastic muscle arm hand compare injection saline ( would nothing ) combine rehabilitation therapy improvement active function task post-stroke patient . Injections target reduce common spasticity pattern arm hand include : bent elbow , palm forearm , bent wrist , thumb-in-palm , clenched fist , hand deformity . This do Emory University . Neither doctor injecting drug subject receive drug know get BOTOX® saline . Which type injection subject receive completely randomize ( like flip coin ) .
