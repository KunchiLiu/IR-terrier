	<detailed_description>This non randomized , single center clinical investigation , evaluate total fifty ( 50 ) limb treatment venous stasis ulceration use Vari-Lase laser . Subjects pre-screened utilizing standard care data specify inclusion/exclusion criterion ensure eligible treatment investigation . All subject map duplex ultrasound study Intersocietal Commission Accreditation Vascular Laboratories ( ICAVL ) approve vascular laboratory . The ultrasound verify presence absence IPVs . The number , diameter , location IPVs map . If subject appear qualify investigation , subject ask give his/her write informed consent enrol investigation . Upon satisfy inclusion/exclusion criterion subject accept study . After enrollment , investigator document CEAP class , venous clinical severity score ( VCSS ) , venous disability score ( VDS ) subject 's chart/medical record/source documentation later transcription appropriate case report form . Digital photograph take limb treat prior treatment subject standing , follow standardized photography regimen . All enrol study participant limb treat Vari-Lase laser manufacture VSI . Subject preparation standard great saphenous vein ( GSV ) short saphenous vein , endovenous laser treatment . The initial technical success failure procedure note IPV pre-diameter IPV record . Multiple perforators may treat single patient , well bilateral procedure allow . Follow-up duplex exam conduct within first week treatment 6 month . Follow-up duplex verify patency vs. closure IPV , presence absence deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) associate IPV . The goal prove successful closure treat IPVs vein demonstrate duplex ultrasound 6 week show maintained closure IPVs 6 month . Clinical examination occur 2 week Associated Research Nurse Practitioner , 6 week Medical Doctor , 6 month either Nurse Practitioner Medical Doctor . At 6 week visit , photo take limb treated reclassification CEAP class , VDS , VCSS .</detailed_description>
