	<brief_summary>A multicenter , randomize , control , single blind study evaluate effectiveness Seprafilm® Adhesion Barrier reduce adhesion formation cesarean delivery . Primary outcome measurement extent severity adhesion time subsequent cesarean delivery . Secondary outcome include measure safety , operative time ( ex. , incision-delivery ; total operative time ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Seprafilm® Adhesion Barrier Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients present labor delivery delivery screen eligibility . If patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion , offer enrollment study . After project inform consent review patient question answer , ask sign inform consent . At point , consider candidate randomization . If patient subsequently undergoes cesarean delivery , randomize either : 1 . Group A - Placement Seprafilm® prior abdominal closure 2 . Group B - Routine closure without placement Seprafilm® The chance assign either group equal ( i.e. , 1:1 randomization ) . The patient blind regard Seprafilm placement . The investigator collect additional data patient , antepartum course , intra-operative event , post-operative course . There additional test procedure order performed hospital stay part protocol . Enrollment study expect alter patient 's length stay . The antepartum , operative , post-operative care patient direct patient 's physician participating institution 's standard policy procedure . This study way change direct care patient would receive , except regard placement Seprafilm® Adhesion Barrier . A short-term telephone follow-up conduct approximately 6-8 week follow randomization assess immediate post-operative complication . If patient becomes pregnant undergoes repeat cesarean delivery participate institution , location severity adhesion ( ) would assess time repeat cesarean delivery . The investigator extract additional data chart include operative time , blood loss , complication . An evaluation adhesion would conclude patient 's participation study .</detailed_description>
