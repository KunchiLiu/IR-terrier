	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare cost-effectiveness treat malaria base three method diagnosis ( rapid test , microscopy presumptive diagnosis ) among patient attend level three government health centre locate area low high transmission intensity Uganda . The study hypothesis : low high transmission area , cost-effectiveness malaria treatment Artemether-Lumefantrine improved adoption rapid diagnostic test compare presumptive diagnosis microscopy ; difference cost-effectiveness Artemether-Lumefantrine treatment follow rapid diagnostic test microscopy versus presumptive diagnosis great low transmission area .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Parasite-based Diagnosis Malaria Uganda : Feasibility Cost-Effectiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development drug resistance malaria parasites lead Uganda Ministry Health ( MoH ) change first-line anti-malarial treatment cheap Chloroquine/Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine combination expensive Artemether-Lumefantrine . The MoH recommend treatment fever case malaria within 24 hour illness first-line drug . Under policy , patient malaria present febrile illness receive Coartem® result significant drug wastage . With increased cost first-line drug , wastage place substantial potentially remediable burden health budget . As , need gauge whether accurate malaria diagnosis microscopy and/or rapid diagnostic test , might improve cost-effectiveness new treatment regime . Specific objectives 1 . To assess feasibility rapid test microscopy diagnosis malaria health centre III . 2 . To compare cost-effectiveness treat malaria Artemether- Lumefantrine base microscopy , rapid test presumptive diagnosis different transmission intensity 3 . To assess whether introduction malaria parasite-based diagnosis ( rapid test microscopy ) government Health Centre III improve overall cost-effectiveness outpatient management febrile illness Sample size determination The sample size determine use standard formula . Estimating sensitivity either test 90 % , Zα =1.96 stratify age ( &lt; 5 year ≥5 year ) , calculate sample 272 per health centre . Therefore , total number patient 6 health centre two district = 6 x 272 = 1632 . Baseline : Baseline data collect current malaria treatment practice ; clinician ' view malaria diagnosis ; concern towards new treatment ; health centre staff . Geographical location visit government health centre record use Germin etrex global positioning system ( Germin International Inc. , Olathe , USA ) . At six selected health centre , social demographic data collect 613 patient . Implementation intervention : The main intervention comprise three malaria diagnostic approach : presumptive diagnosis , field microscopy rapid test ( Paracheck Pf® device - Orchid Biomedical Systems , Goa , India ) . Each approach randomly allocate health centre . The first-line drug use Artemether/Lumefantrine ( 20mg/120mg ) ( Novartis , Switzerland ) . Consenting subject consecutively enrol point attend clinician suspect uncomplicated malaria . Where microscopy main diagnostic method , thick thin blood smear prepare per patient enrol . Where rapid test main method , patient test . One hundred patient per health centre randomly select provide blood specimen validation use expert microscopy PCR `` gold standard . '' After enrolment , patient systematically tracked departure health centre . Patients follow seventh day treatment assess clinical improvement . Those fail return schedule date trace home eighth day . Follow-up activity include : documentation drug prescribe dispense ; clinically ass patient 's status comparison Day 0 ; perform test include PCR patient show improvement ; pill count drug remain - patient complete dose ; documentation reason complete dose ; documentation patient buy prescribed drug stock Day 0 . Effectiveness measure number patient commence treatment Artemether/Lumefantrine . However , patient follow effectiveness also measure 7th day treatment indicate clinical improvement . The feasibility diagnostic method ongoing March 2010 date .</detailed_description>
