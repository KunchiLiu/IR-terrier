	<brief_summary>Patients hypothyroidism routinely treat thyroid hormone ( l-thyroxine ) replacement therapy . Physicians monitor thyroid hormone dose measure thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) level blood , goal normal level . However , recent data suggest `` normal '' TSH range broad , patient may still symptoms TSH level top bottom part normal range . To study issue , useful address issue general health status , psychological symptom , mood , memory , metabolic status , since thyroid hormone major effect brain adn metabolism , since patient treated hypothyroidism often symptoms related area . In present study , otherwise healthy subject treat hypothyroidism , age 20-75 year , enrol 7-11month study . At baseline , test health status , psychological symptom , mood , memory , body composition , energy expenditure perform . Following baseline measurement , subject receive either usual dose l-thyroxine , slightly high low dose . The dos choose try achieve either low-normal TSH level , high-normal TSH level , mildly elevate TSH level . Which target TSH patient assign determined randomly , neither subject study contact know dose patient receiving . Subjects see every 6 week study brief visit make sure side effect , adjust l-thyroxine dos TSH yet reach target range . At 24-week visit ( end study ) , subject undergo test baseline visit . Results study examine see minor change TSH thyroid hormone level cause change outcomes , degree TSH change correlate degree outcome change .
