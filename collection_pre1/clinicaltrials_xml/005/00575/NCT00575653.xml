	<brief_title>Safety Study GBS Following Menactra Meningococcal Vaccination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Through partnership use data resource three national two regional health plan insurer , conduct multi-site retrospective study relationship immunization tetravalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine ( MCV4 ) Guillain-Barré syndrome ( GBS ) adolescent ( age 11-21 year age ) 42-month period March 1 , 2005 August 31 , 2008 . This collaboration several feature distribute data network , provide instructive example feasibility large scale population-based post-market evidence development . Participants include five research organization either part , closely affiliate , health plan insurer : HealthCore Inc. ( affiliated WellPoint ) , Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield Pennsylvania , i3 Drug Safety , Aetna , Inc. , Kaiser Permanente Center Health Research Hawaii . There coordinate center Harvard Medical School Department Ambulatory Care Prevention Harvard Pilgrim Health Care . The organization provide coverage approximately 80 million individual ( age ) , information approximately 50 million available analysis . Each organization provide scientific , informatics , management expertise regard population data , overall design conduct study . This retrospective study use hybrid design three analytic component : 1 ) characterization entire cohort regard demographic , eligible time observation , immunization status , incidence rate GBS various category person time ( never immunize , immunization , 42 day immunization , etc . ) , comorbidities covariates , 2 ) nest case-control study assess risk associate immunization , 3 ) self-controlled case series assess immunization associate risk . Cohort analysis Sites use program distribute coordinate center compute incidence rate GBS accord age , sex , season , MCV4 vaccination status among full base population ( health plan enrollees meet age cohort eligibility criterion ) . Additionally , vaccination rate MCV4 accord age , sex , calendar year compute among cohort member . Incidence rate GBS provide analysis use calculate attributable risk GBS follow MCV4 vaccination significant relationship identify . Nested case control analysis A nested case-control analysis utilize pool analytic datasets site use estimate risk GBS 42 day MCV4 vaccination relative risk GBS among vaccine non-vaccinees time ( study 's primary objective ) , adjust age , sex , vaccination among 11- &lt; 19 year old . All potential case GBS among cohort member identify , sample 100 non-cases risk set case randomly select matched age , sex , state residence . Their vaccination history covariates include analytic datasets transfer coordinate center pool multivariate analysis . Covariates estimate index date assign within case-control set date GBS onset associate case . The relative risk GBS associate MCV4 vaccination estimate use conditional logistic regression analysis SAS . Variables include : - Dependent variable : GBS case status - Main independent variable : Analysis A : MCV4 vaccination 1-42 day prior index date ; Analysis B : MCV4 vaccination 1-7 , 8-14 , 15-28 , 29-42 day prior index date - Matching factor : Age ; sex ; study site ; state residence - Other covariates : Exposure Tdap , Td , Hepatitis B , HPV , tetanus , influenza vaccine 42 day prior GBS onset date ; exposure MPSV4 vaccine 42 day prior GBS onset date ( separate model model MCV4 exposure ) We also assess potential effect modification different vaccine , accord age , season , geographic region , stratify analysis test interaction term within conditional logistic regression model . Self-Control Analysis An additional case-series analysis ( refer `` Analysis C '' ) perform among subset adjudicate GBS case prior MCV4 vaccination . Date MCV4 vaccination serve index date patient . The relative incidence rate GBS `` control '' period 43 day follow vaccination compare incidence `` expose '' risk window 1-42 day follow vaccination use log linear modeling term expose control period . Variables include : - Dependent variable : Time GBS - Main independent variable : Analysis C : Time period 1-42 day post vaccination compare 43 day post vaccination - Other covariates ( included sample size permit ) : Time period correspond 1-42 day follow : Tdap , Td , Hepatitis B , HPV , tetanus , influenza vaccination We also assess potential effect modification different vaccine , accord age , season , geographic region , race/ethnicity , stratify analysis test interaction term within log linear model , sample size permit . Analysis C perform end study period . GBS Case Descriptive Analysis Several additional secondary objective address evaluation GBS case base review abstract information medical chart , administrative claim data . Cases GBS identify among cohort member 19- &lt; 22 year old identify administrative claim data , adjudicate review abstract medical record information manner equivalent cohort member 11- &lt; 19 year old . These case quantify , clinical presentation describe compare case among 11- &lt; 19 year old , regard least follow factor : proportion case classify definite GBS case , severity illness measure mortality , hospitalization GBS , total duration hospitalization day , mechanical ventilation require , total number day mechanical ventilation , intravenous immunoglobulin therapy , plasmapheresis , immunosuppressive therapy . Similar comparison make regard clinical presentation GBS among MCV4 vaccinee compare non-vaccinees . The number GBS case history vaccine include study 42 day prior GBS onset also describe . A line list create potential case GBS . For adjudicated case GBS , list indicate final case status , element case definition meet , immunization status ( MCV4 , MPSV4 , Tdap , Td , HepB , HPV , tetanus , influenza ) indicator infection febrile illness prior 42 day , gender , age , month year GBS onset , brief description disease severity . Additional line list create censored case ( adjudicated non-cases ) include reason censoring , potential case chart could obtain insufficient information obtain chart adjudicate case status .</detailed_description>
