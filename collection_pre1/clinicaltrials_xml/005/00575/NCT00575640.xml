	<brief_title>Hydralazine Demethylating Agent Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct phase I/II clinical trial . In addition determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) hydralazine , phase I trial perform identify unexpected toxicity may occur hydralazine use conjunction neoadjuvant chemotherapy normotensive patient rectal cancer . Once phase I trial successfully complete , phase II trial evaluate efficacy hydralazine produce demethylation effect begin . This phase I/II trial require 31 47 patient complete . • Phase I Study The objective study determine MTD Hydralazine add standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy operable rectum cancer . Four dose level hydralazine plan : Dose Level 1 : 150 mg/d 50 mg PO TID Dose Level 2 : 200 mg/d 50 mg PO QID Dose Level 3 : 225 mg/d 75 mg PO TID</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The principal objective study perform molecular evaluation reversal methylation clinical material collect two different time point . The first sample represent untreated ( biopsy sample ) , later hydralazinetreated specimen ( resection specimen ) . Accordingly , use routine inclusion criterion enrollment ( histology clinical stage ) , realize majority operable rectal cancer stage IIIII , treatment—again specify restricted—will likely follow standard therapy disease ( infusional 5Fluorouracil radiation therapy ) . The accrual target phase II segment trial small allow traditional clinical endpoint assessment ( response rate , time treatment failure survival ) . Accordingly , plan follow endpoint part study . Patients refer surgery gastroenterology service diagnostic evaluation rectal cancer candidate participate study . Patients history elevate blood pressure already antihypertensive drug would ideal candidate project . In situation , hydralazine replace antihypertensive duration study . There age limit study . Inclusion criterion follow : 1 . Operable rectal cancer ( overwhelming majority Adenocarcinoma ) 2 . Signed informed consent 3 . Baseline blood pressure OFF antihypertensives 100/50 mmHg 1 . Preexisting hypotension ( define protocol BP 100/50 ) 2 . Preexisting liver disease ( liver function test 2x upper limit normal ULM ) . 3 . Preexisting kidney ( serum creatinine 2 mg/dl ) . 4 . Medical necessity remain betablockers meet agent . 5 . Coronary even precede 2 month prior enrollment . Coronary even include follow : Acute Myocardial Infarction Cardiac catheterization regardless outcome procedure need intervention History Valvular heart disease History hypertrophic cardiomyopathy leave ventricular outflow tract obstruction .</criteria>
