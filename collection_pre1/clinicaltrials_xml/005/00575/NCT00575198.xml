	<brief_title>Drainage Amount Removal Thoracostomy Tube</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thoracostomy tube routinely use drain pleural space fluid gas optimize pulmonary mechanic . Clinicians frequently postpone removal thoracostomy tubes drainage tube exceed specific volume threshold prior 24 hour . However , substantial variability drainage volume threshold different clinician use , threshold establish clearly superior . Removing tube independently drainage volume may result great risk pleural effusion pneumothorax require invasive drainage procedure . However , remove tube independently drainage volume might also expedite recovery allow early removal tube , thus diminish pain increase patient mobility . Thoracostomy tube management practice , include drainage volume threshold use , may dissimilar different type disease process , study restrict patient require thoracostomy tube treatment traumatic injury .</detailed_description>
