	<brief_summary>Effective therapy human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection markedly prolong survival infected individual . As result , diseases become clinically significant . Approximately 30 % HIV infect patient co-infected hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) lead co-morbid disease co-infected individual . The histologic severity natural history HCV report accelerated co-infected HIV . It hypothesize 1 ) severity progression HCV disease relate immune competence individual , 2 ) immune restoration associate HIV therapy may accelerate progression HCV disease may explain marked increase HCV related morbidity mortality observe recent year , 3 ) virologic response anti-HCV treatment directly relate degree immunologic competence . The specific aim proposal : 1 ) To obtain , multi-disciplinary didactic teaching , necessary skill clinical research design , data collection , data analysis , biostatistical method 2 ) To study impact HIV disease HCV , effect immune function immune restoration HIV therapy natural history HCV , efficacy HCV treatment HIV co-infection .</brief_summary>
