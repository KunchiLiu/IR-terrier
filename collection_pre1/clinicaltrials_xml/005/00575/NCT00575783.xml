	<brief_title>Impact Hypoglycemia Unawareness Brain Metabolism Cognition T1DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During course treat diabetes ( example , insulin injection ) , blood sugar level sometimes drop low . This condition know hypoglycemia . Normally , healthy body respond hypoglycemia produce number `` anti-insulin '' hormone raise blood sugar level . In addition , hormone provide individual warning signal hypoglycemia , include hunger , sweat , shake heart palpitation . These warn signal allow diabetic correct low blood sugar level eat sugar tablet snack . Unfortunately , unclear reason , many people longstanding diabetes lose ability recognize low blood sugar levels-a condition call `` hypoglycemia unawareness . '' The brain , particular , extremely sensitive hypoglycemia . Unable sense respond low blood sugar level , individual may experience sudden onset blur vision , confusion , seizure , coma , even death . In recent year , new technique call `` islet cell transplantation '' develop alternate mean treat insulin-dependent diabetes . Pancreatic islet cell ( cell produce insulin ) , human donor , inject diabetic patient 's liver cell capable make insulin regulate blood sugar level without need insulin injection . Currently , technique use primarily patient severe hypoglycemia unawareness . While know islet cell transplantation reduce risk severe hypoglycemia , effect transplantation hypoglycemia unawareness unknown . This study design investigate hypoglycemia unawareness happen impact brain function individual type 1 diabetes .</detailed_description>
