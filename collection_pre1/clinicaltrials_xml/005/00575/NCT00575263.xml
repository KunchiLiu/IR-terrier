	<detailed_description>The human tooth pulp rich source pain fiber common site pathology often accompany spontaneous stimulus-induced lingering pain . A common treatment modality include extraction offend tooth diagnose irreversible pulpitis . Extracted teeth represent abundant source normal diseased human nociceptors evaluation tissue represent powerful model study human pain mechanism since character pain , pain level , response stimulus document prior extraction . The overall objective study correlate change expression Sodium Channels ( NaCh ) clinical response hot cold thermal stimulus , expression associate receptors/transducers responsible receive stimulus extract teeth severe spontaneous pain . Teeth require extraction clinical setting use study . The research question : 1 . ) To evaluate quantitatively overall NaCh Nav 1.3 , 1.6 , 1.7 , 1.8 1.9 isoform expression nerve normal teeth compare diseased teeth 2 . ) To evaluate quantitatively hot/cold VR1 CMR1 receptor expression nerve normal teeth compare nerve modality-specific pain group diseased teeth 3 . ) To investigate ultrastructural localization NaCh isoforms different fiber type site may involve pain generation .</detailed_description>
