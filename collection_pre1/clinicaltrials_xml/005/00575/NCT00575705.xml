	<brief_summary>The University Alabama Birmingham Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease Core Center ( UAB RPKDCC ) establish NIDDK-funded , interdisciplinary center excellence PKD-related research , specific emphasis recessive PKD . Among five Cores , UAB RPKDCC include ARPKD Clinical Genetic Resource , Core resource design develop unique set clinical , genetic , educational resource ARPKD . The Core three primary objective : 1 . To extend observational study ARPKD initiate North American ARPKD Database . 2 . To provide mechanism genetic evaluation patient classic ARPKD unusual phenotype recessive PKD . 3 . To develop educational tool physicians patient regard natural history , cause , development effect disease , genetic testing , clinical trial applicable ARPKD .</brief_summary>
