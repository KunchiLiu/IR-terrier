	<brief_summary>To assess importance intracellular signalling pathway deregulation adiposity diabetes-related insulin resistance , liver tissue sample patient suffer non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) analyze prospectively liver tissue bank .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Cohort Study Patients With NAFLD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients suspect fatty liver disease screen ( excluded presence ) alternative clinical condition associate NAFLD ( see exclusion criterion ) . Of patient fulfil inclusion criterion , relevant baseline characteristic ( incl . epidemiological , physiological biochemical data ) obtain . In addition , radiological examination perform use sonography fibroscan ass non-invasively individual extent hepatic fat deposition , liver stiffness ( fibrosis ) amount visceral fat mass . In case high clinical , laboratory radiological suspicion NAFLD , diagnostic liver biopsy perform . A part liver tissue use histological confirmation NAFLD subsequent grading stag accord establish criterion . Parts remain liver tissue store later molecular histological analysis . In addition , several serum sample collect patient stored future analysis . All patient follow annually ( incl . physical examination , metabolic characterisation , clinical chemistry liver sonography ) additional serum sample collect future analysis . Liver biopsy repeat defined time period , case clinical evidence disease progression .</detailed_description>
