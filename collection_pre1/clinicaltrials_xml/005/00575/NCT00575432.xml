	<detailed_description>Early specific detection dysfunction kidney diseases differential diagnosis potential complication renal allograft fundamental initiate appropriate treatment . In addition , determination renal function may reveal physiological mechanism may prove useful future therapeutic procedure . Currently , use method access renal function like ultrasound , radionuclide imaging , laboratory method several disadvantage , nonspecific , require radioactive contrast agent limit spatial information . Therefore , alternative non-invasive method detect early morphological functional change require . Recently , variety promising advance magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) method evolve obtain functional information different organ . These method include MR angiography , diffusion , perfusion Blood-Oxygenation Level Dependent ( BOLD ) image . In addition MRI , MR spectroscopy ( MRS ) provide renal functional information . In abdominal organ like kidney , respiratory , cardiac motion susceptibility artifact limit use functional MR method clinical application . However , may overcome advent greatly enhance hardware , allow fast image time . Besides vivo technique , novel processing algorithm complex ex vivo MR spectra body fluid emerge recently . These method , label `` Metabonomics '' , access renal function obtain metabolic profile indicative renal dysfunction . The researcher hypothesize non-invasive method correlate histology `` gold standard '' compete favorably conventional part invasive evaluation method , thus provide specific early detection kidney diseases various etiology , drug toxicity renal allograft dysfunction .</detailed_description>
