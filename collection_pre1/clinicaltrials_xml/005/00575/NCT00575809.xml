	<brief_title>Incidence Factors Associated With Development Severity Oral Mucositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Our study intend evaluate prospectively incidence severity oral mucositis patient undergo high-dose chemotherapy hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , well evaluate potential influence nutritional- , physical- , transplant-related factor associate development complication grade involvement . Research plan : This prospective cohort study observational basis involve patient undergo high-dose chemotherapy peripheral blood stem cell transplantation Audie L. Murphy VA Hospital Bone Marrow Transplant Unit University Hospital Bone Marrow Transplant Unit . We expect enroll 400 patient 5-year period . Methods : In order answer study question , subject assess several time study period . The study involve multidisciplinary group evaluate follow subject . A baseline establish physician nutritionist subject start high-dose chemotherapy regimen . The subject follow oral evaluation 3 time per week , begin day transplant end mucositis resolve , patient discharge home , 30 day post-transplant , whichever occur first . At day 15 post-transplant , patient evaluate second time nutritionist . Further information blood value , use medication treatment complication , obtain daily chart review . Clinical relevance : Mucositis , without doubt , one common debilitate complication result intense cytotoxic therapy precede hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Mucositis problem patient need deal pain rapidly decrease quality life , also problem health system . Mucositis frequently result increase hospital length stay , result significant increase cost medical care . Multiple prophylactic therapeutic attempt make order control symptoms severity mucositis . No prevention cure available disease . Despite renew interest complication , important gap knowledge remain area supportive care cancer patient . These gap knowledge wider area mucositis patient undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation .</detailed_description>
