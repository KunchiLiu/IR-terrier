	<brief_summary>The NIH grant fund development physiological brain atlas registry allow u significantly improve data collectioin use physiological data normalize brain volume . This initially use improve DBS implant Parkinson 's Disease , Dystonia , Essential Tremor , OCD , include data acquire stereotactic brain procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physiological Brain Atlas Development</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : To create brain atlas allow physiological clinical information assign anatomical location MRI space , utilize non-rigid MRI normalization algorithm . These data specifically acquire population patient undergoing stereotactic brain procedure . 2 . To collate analyze brain data place atlas statistical manner allow doctor understand treat brain disease precisely base population data . For example , would allow surgeon predict optimal target location DBS implant , neurologist program implant base multiple physiological variable , include pre-operative severity disease , intraoperative neurophysiological observation , post-operative response previous therapy large population subject . 3 . To allow precise relationship visualize one anonymized MRI volume , lead new finding across large population subject field brain science . 4 . To locate data HIPAA compliant , anonymized location clinicians researcher access securely without compromise personal healthcare information ( PHI ) . Protocol : 1 . 1 . Patients consent undergo undergone stereotactic brain procedure reason ask participate study . 2 . Permission patient seek allow entry relate data enter atlas database . Specifically , include related pre-operative , intra-operative , post-operative clinical , radiographic , psychologic test do purpose surgery . 3 . The data must enter confidential fashion secure within section database access person authorize view patient healthcare information ( PHI ) . Persons authorize enter view individual PHI must take pass CITI certification present documentation credential IRB study investigator ( Dr. Konrad ) Clinical Trials Specialist ( Melba Isom ) . 4 . Access individual patient data within database do secure login link person 's qualification access PHI . The list authorized person ( treat physician member surgical team ) determine Dr. Konrad update least annual basis within database Dr. Dawant Dr. D'Haese . Drs . Dawant / D'Haese responsible ensure PHI physically virtually secure within atlas database . 5 . Once database , patient identifier codify accessible query outside certified step 3 . Non-patient specific information analyze , sort queried response specific statistical question investigator research team authorize person , designate database developer ( Dr. Dawant ) designee . 6 . Data contain within atlas analyze regularly report member Atlas research team regard accurate display representation data . 7 . Clinical physiological data continue enter every subject consent participate study duration care . 8 . If subject longer wish data track within atlas , call study coordinator ( Melba Isom ) name remove data collection time notification forward . All previously collect data still accessible expunged database . 9 . We plan recruit 5,000 patient Vanderbilt participate site .</detailed_description>
