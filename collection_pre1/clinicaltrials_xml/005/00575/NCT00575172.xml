	<detailed_description>A survey show frequently observe direct cause death diabetic patient cardiovascular disorder . However , investigation survey DCCT , UKPDS KUMAMOTO-study , etc . clarify strict control blood sugar level prevent development progress diabetic microangiopathy , could show significant effect great vessel disorder . Recently , DECODA-study , DECODE-study Honolulu-study demonstrate postprandial high blood sugar involve great vessel disorder . Therefore , possible prevention great vessel disorder diabetic patient suggest improve postprandial blood sugar level achieve use ultrarapid-acting type insulin , become available recently . Even result Europe US obtain , life-style incidence complication Japanese people different , many point remain uncertain respect direct application foreign result Japanese people . Therefore , Japan also , necessary conduct large-scale clinical study establish high-level evidence use mainly Japanese people hospital many patient .</detailed_description>
