	<brief_summary>This multi-center , prospective evaluation leave ventricular recovery conventional therapy patient recent onset dilate cardiomyopathy . In subject disorder , heart recover significantly first year , others leave chronically weak heart . The protein help heart recover encode gene , differ markedly individual . The goal current study determine whether variation gene involve affect probability heart recover . We also look gene involve inflammation one `` turn '' ( produce protein ) circulate white blood cell . { These statement add site choose participate RNA analysis } . In addition , study look level proteins blood , proteins call `` cytokine ' control inflammation proteins call `` neurohormone '' release heart weaken , affect likelihood recovery . Enrollment take place 15 center . The goal enroll approximately 500 adult subject ( age 18 year old , men woman ) course approximately 48 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Looking Recovery New Onset Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After present new onset idiopathic dilate cardiomyopathy , one third patient experience dramatic recovery leave ventricular function , majority chronic heart failure leave ventricular dysfunction persist . This marked variation clinical outcome determine part genetic heterogeneity systemic response myocardial injury . This population exclude clinical trial study examine role cytokine neurohormonal mediator modulate balance leave ventricular recovery remodel early cardiomyopathy . This proposal investigate whether genetic polymorphism inflammatory neurohormonal mediator influence subsequent clinical outcome patient recent onset primary ( idiopathic ) dilate cardiomyopathy . The study enroll 500 patient recent onset leave ventricular dysfunction ( LVEF &lt; 0.40 ) due non-ischemic primary cardiomyopathy eleven center follow patient prospectively evaluate subsequent leave ventricular recovery freedom clinical event . Specific aim 1 determine correlation echocardiographic parameter systolic diastolic functional entry circulate inflammatory mediator : TNF , IL-6 TNF receptor 1 2 . Specific aim 2 determine predictive value early plasma TNFÎ± level leave ventricular size transthoracic echo baseline predicting improvement leave ventricular ejection function ( LVEF ) 6 month . Specific aim 3 evaluate effect TNFA 1/2 promoter polymorphism circulate plasma TNF level influence subsequent improvement LVEF . Specific aim 4 look impact deletion allele angiotensin-converting enzyme genetic variation beta 1 beta 2 adrenergic receptor leave ventricular recovery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must 18 year , may either gender race . 2 . Patients must significantly systolic dysfunction , define leave ventricular ejection fraction less equal 40 % transthoracic echocardiography . 3 . The patient must recent onset dilate cardiomyopathy . Specifically , initial sign symptom cardiomyopathy predate time evaluation study six month . 4 . Subjects diagnose peripartum cardiomyopathy ( PPCM ) allow long enrol within six month cardiac symptom . 5 . Subjects present acute heart failure positive familial history cardiomyopathy include . Subjects asymptomatic , diagnose cardiomyopathy unknown duration screen know familial disease exclude 6 . Patients must competent give inform consent . 1 . Coronary artery disease define single coronary artery stenosis major epicardial vessel great 50 % previous history myocardial infarction . 2 . Patients history familial cardiomyopathy , primary relative define parent , sibling child dilate cardiomyopathy exclude . 3 . Past present history alcoholism , whose current alcohol consumption exceed average three drink per day . A past history cocaine IV drug abuse possible explanation cardiomyopathy well substance abuse prescription pain reliever illicit drug may hinder participant 's ability complete study followup . 4 . Patients post cardiac transplant . 5 . Patients whose heart failure felt secondary primary valvular disease , uncorrected thyroid disease , uncontrolled hypertension despite medical therapy , obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , pericardial disease , systemic illness sarcoidosis . 6 . Patients whose history cardiac symptom sign cardiac disease predate time evaluation six month exclude . 7 . Evidence ongoing bacteremia sepsis . Patient febrile illness felt secondary myocarditis include ( even nondiagnostic biopsy ) bacteriologic cause illness exclude . 8 . Patients life threaten disease malignancy would likely decrease life expectancy next three year . Any history malignancy treat either chest radiation chemotherapy . 9 . The following patient exclude medical reason : Patients evidence chronic liver disease ( total bilirubin &gt; 3.0mg % ) chronic renal disease ( creatinine &gt; equal 2.5mg % ) exclude study . Subjects present acute worsen renal function liver function test set potentially fulminant myocarditis enrol . Patients whose hepatic abnormality secondary hypoperfusion also consider . 10 . Patients previous history diabetes evidence multisystem end organ damage ( i.e . end stage renal disease cardiomyopathy ) evidence coronary disease . Patient diabetes without significant end organ damage allow . 11 . Patients enrol placebo control experimental trial . 12 . Patients myocardial biopsy , reveals evidence hemochromatosis , amyloid , sarcoidosis , giant cell myocarditis , exclude .</criteria>
