	<brief_summary>The goal project understand whether glycine helpful improving symptom schizophrenia low motivation , loss interest , social isolation . In addition , investigator want find glycine improves memory . This project involve three-and-a-half month trial glycine placebo . A placebo look exactly like study drug , contain active drug . Glycine naturally occur substance part proteins body . Glycine approve FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) treatment schizophrenia . However , FDA allow use research study . Related Study McLean Hospital : If would like participate study glycine versus placebo Freedom Trail Clinic , investigator ask would also like participate relate study McLean Hospital . The study McLean Hospital look effect glycine placebo level glycine brain . The study use magnetic resonance spectroscopy measure brain glycine level . The magnetic resonance ( MR ) scanner look like large cylinder tube run center . You ask lie back foam-padded table place head special holder . The table slide inside `` hole '' scanner . Soft foam rubber sponge may place side head comfort help keep head move . Because scanner contains strong magnet , ask remove metal object person include , limited : watch , ring , necklace , bracelet , earring body piercings , belt , loose change , wallet ( credit card ) , item clothe contain magnetic material ( example , underwire bra , certain type zipper ) , shoe . These item secure safe place scan complete . You able remain street clothes . The investigator ask study staff McLean Hospital contact tell study . You may refuse contacted McLean Hospital . However , participate study McLean , eligible study Freedom Trail Clinic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If agree participate study , take glycine placebo 12 week - two 6-week period . These two 6-week period separate 2-week `` wash-out '' period take study medication . During one 6-week period , take glycine . During 6-week period , take placebo . Neither study staff know order receive glycine placebo . In case emergency , quickly find medication take .

You carbon monoxide breath measure . Carbon monoxide gas contain cigarette smoke , measure level carbon monoxide breath help u tell whether smoke cigarette . To measure carbon monoxide , breathe small hand-held machine . We also ask regular activity day kind hobbies/interests . Then memory test interviewer tell story ask repeat back . After complete initial assessment , begin take study medication . The study medication glycine identical placebo form liquid . A one-week supply medication give weekly visit McLean Hospital . You take one dose medication breakfast morning second dose medication dinner even . You keep study medication refrigerate . You take approximately 30 gram ( 1 quarter liter ) twice per day first 6 week , exact amount take depend upon weight . We instruct exactly much take . At end first 6 week study , stop take glycine identical placebo 2 week . During 2 week take study medication , arrange come brief check visit ( week 7 ) ask side effect stop take medication . After two week take medication , start take glycine placebo next 6 week . You change regular medication study . You continue take medication throughout study . You notify Dr. Evins research staff start take new medication . You come every week pick study medication . We ask come interview test memory four time throughout study . The first time initial visit describe , start take study medication . The assessment take place 6 week study ( end first 6-week period study medication ) , 8 week study ( 2-week `` washout '' period take study medication ) , 14 week study ( end second 6-week period study medication ) . There total 4 blood draw occur 4 separate occasion . The blood draw take place day scan visit McLean Hospital . At blood draw , take 1 tablespoon blood . The total amount blood take study 4 tablespoon . The study last 14 week . At end study , stop take glycine placebo . If doctor believe glycine helpful wish take study end , available pharmacy , discus option doctor psychiatrist . We ask attend one follow-up visit week end study , ask side effect may experience . We also ask side effect throughout course study . This follow-up visit would last 15 minute .</detailed_description>
