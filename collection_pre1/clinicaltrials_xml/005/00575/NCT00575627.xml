	<brief_summary>Patients chronic hepatitis C persistently normal alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) level generally exclude treatment , strong conviction normal ALT would synonymous absence liver damage . However , recent study demonstrate marked liver fibrosis , include cirrhosis , patient HCV persistently normal ALT level . Up , sigle randomize , control , multicenter study lead evaluate efficacy safety combine therapy patient chronic hepatitis C persistently normal serum ALT level . Aim study evaluate efficacy treatment outcome treat patient compare control group untreated patient .</brief_summary>
