	<brief_title>Study Pain Perception Between Males Females Following Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A patient 's gender strong significant predictor substantial difference clinical outcome postoperative pain , analgesic use , surgical complication ( gangrenous gallbladder , empyema gallbladder , gallbladder perforation , conversion open surgery ) follow laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( Bingener et al. , 2002 ; Bingener et al. , 2003 ; Uchiyama et al. , 2006 ) . Although females present laparoscopic cholecystectomy frequently ( 76 % case ) ; prevalence surgical complication cholecystectomy high men , frequently inflammation deterioration gallbladder ( Bingener et al. , 2002 ; Bingener et al. , 2003 ; Stefanidis et al. , 2006 ) . Post-operatively , however , female report significantly great pain score require large amount analgesic ( Uchiyama et al. , 2006 ) , suggest although surgery complete few problem , female still report post-operative pain . Sex-related difference pain threshold tolerance thermal , pressure , electrical stimulus experimental pain model indicate pain difference solely due psychosocial distinction sex ( Riley et al. , 1998 ) . There multiple physiological difference male female ; however , considerable evidence implicates estrogenic sex hormone critical factor sex-dependent difference pain ( see review Fillingim Ness , 2000 ) . It possible estrogen alter inflammatory mediator profile gallbladder , subsequently increase sensitization visceral neuron innervate gallbladder , result increase pain female . The first portion study extend association patient sex clinical outcome determine whether circulate and/or local estrogen level correlate difference peri-operative morbidity , include intra-operative complication , conversion open cholecystectomy , postoperative pain , inadequate wound healing , intra-abdominal infection , disability mortality . Previous study demonstrate cytokine TNFalpha IL-1beta alter sensitivity sensory neuron increase nociception ( Opree Kress , 2000 ) . To determine whether estrogen level alter profile inflammatory mediator within gallbladder result increase nociceptive threshold female , correlate circulating and/or local level estrogens amount inflammatory mediator present within laparoscopically excise gallbladder biopsy . Patients meet inclusion criterion recruit University Hospital San Antonio . Inflammatory mediator , include cytokine IL-1beta , TNFalpha , IL-8 , IL-6 , IL-10 , IL-12p70 assay interstitial fluid biopsy fundus infundibulum gallbladder . Biopsies classify accord clinical assessment prior surgery control expect difference inflammatory mediator acute versus chronic cholecystitis . The immediate effect research clearly delineate whether estrogen predictive improve clinical outcome follow surgery determine whether sex hormone correlate alter production inflammatory mediator gallbladder .</detailed_description>
