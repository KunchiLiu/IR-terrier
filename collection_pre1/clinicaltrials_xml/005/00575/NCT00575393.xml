	<brief_title>Gold Sodium Thiomalate Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine maximum tolerate dose gold sodium thiomalate patient advance non-small cell lung cancer . - To describe toxicity associate treatment . - To describe preliminary evidence biologic activity . - To assess correlation PKCι expression antitumor effect gold sodium thiomalate . - To study association clinical ( toxicity and/or tumor response activity ) pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter . - To describe anti-proliferative activity gold sodium thiomalate 3-deoxy-3- [ ^18F ] -fluorothymidine positron emission tomography image . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study gold sodium thiomalate . Patients receive gold sodium thiomalate intramuscularly day 1 , 8 , 15 22 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive gold sodium thiomalate every 4 week total cumulative dose 1 gram deliver . Blood sample collect baseline prior therapy week 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 . Samples analyze mass spectometry pharmacokinetics . Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sample analyze PKC_l expression antitumor activity . Antiproliferative effect gold sodium thiomalate analyze 3-deoxy-3- [ ^18F ] -fluorothymidine positron emission tomography imaging .</detailed_description>
