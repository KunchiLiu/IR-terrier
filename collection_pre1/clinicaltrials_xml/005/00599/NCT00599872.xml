	<detailed_description>Specific allergen immunotherapy currently practice USA describe product labeling comprise subcutaneous injection incrementally increase dos target maintenance dose ( `` build-up '' ) follow maintenance injection allergenic extract/vaccine .

Standard practice recommend injection give supervision train physician patient remain physician 's office least 20 30 minute injection . The administration immunotherapy injection recommend home risk inadequate recognition treatment systemic reaction . The inconvenience expense travel allergy injection discomfort repeat injection disincentive form treatment particularly pediatric patient . For example , dropout rate exceed 50 % multi-year course injection treatment report . Alternative route immunotherapy explore , especially Europe attempt improve patient compliance minimize risk serious adverse reaction . For example , sublingual-oral immunotherapy ( SLIT ) , administration allergenic extract/vaccine tongue 1-2 minute follow swallow , proven efficacious safe several double-blind , placebo-controlled study . A recent Cochrane Review conclude , `` SLIT safe treatment , significantly reduce symptom medication requirement allergic rhinitis . '' Efficacy study support use SLIT treatment rhinitis rhinitis asthma . However , dosage schedule highly variable optimal maintenance dose yet establish . Thus , dose study design investigate safety profile determine optimal dos maintenance therapy patient built-up injection IT build-up regimens previously untreated patient . Much United States medical community 's hesitation embrace sublingual immunotherapy viable treatment option allergy patient stem limited information use U.S. license allergenic extract treatment route . Additionally , cost-effectiveness one form therapy clearly evaluate third-party payer accept SLIT insurance coverage .</detailed_description>
