	<brief_title>Cetuximab Radiation Therapy Laryngeal Cancer Patients Who Have Responded One Cycle Chemotherapy ( SPORE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study one cycle chemotherapy administer subject respond well cycle start radiation therapy along chemotherapy n't respond well initial cycle chemotherapy , undergo total laryngectomy ( surgery remove voice box ) follow radiation therapy . The initial cycle chemotherapy consist drug Taxotere , Cisplatin , 5-Fluorouracil ( combination know TPF ) . Then Day 20 study , subject administer another chemotherapy agent call cetuximab ( a.k.a . C-225 ) . It determine patient 's response chemotherapy favorable examine patient 's tumor endoscopy . If response determine good , patient continue chemotherapy regimen addition radiation therapy combination . If patient 's response chemotherapy determine less favorable , patient advise undergo salvage surgery ( a.k.a . laryngectomy ) remove voice box undergo radiation therapy treatment . Additionally , tumor tissue sample blood study see special molecular marker help predict tumor respond chemotherapy radiation treatment .</detailed_description>
