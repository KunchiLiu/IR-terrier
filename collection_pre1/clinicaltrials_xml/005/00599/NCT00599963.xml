	<brief_summary>Immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) nephropathy common type primary glomerulonephritis world . A wealth literature suggest vitamin D analog profound effect immune system function glomerular mesangial cell proliferation . However , calcitriol , standard form vitamin D , carry substantial risk hypercalcemia . Recently , paricalcitol ( 19-nor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 ) approve treatment secondary hyperparathyroidism chronic renal failure , incidence hypercalcemia much low calcitriol . Therefore , investigator plan conduct randomize cross-over study evaluate efficacy paricalcitol treatment IgA nephropathy . Thirty patient biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy recruit . They randomize paricalcitol 12 week treatment , follow cross arm washout period . Proteinuria , renal function , serum urinary inflammatory marker monitor . This study explore potential anti-proteinuric anti-inflammatory effect paricalcitol treatment IgA nephropathy , specific treatment present .</brief_summary>
