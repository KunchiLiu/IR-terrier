	<brief_summary>The primary objective study provide data regard clinical immunologic activity oral dos pravastatin 80mg administered daily 6 consecutive week , treatment active Crohn 's disease show Harvey-Bradshaw Index ( HBI ) and/or elevate C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . We hypothesize pravastatin significantly reduce symptom Crohn 's disease , show decrease HBI , end study period . Secondary outcome study include effect pravastatin C-reactive protein , ESR , proinflammatory cytokine , fecal lactoferrin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The HMG CoA ( 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A ) reductase inhibitor ( statin ) find significantly reduce cardiovascular morbidity mortality ( 1,2 ) . While clinical benefit mediate part change lipid , particularly reduction low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , recent study suggest broad anti-inflammatory effect may also play role modify various inflammatory pathway ( 3 ) . Statins inhibit synthesis several proinflammatory cytokine , include tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , IL-6 , IL-8 ( 4,5 ) . Statins also show reduce inflammation regulate expression MHC II molecule ( 6 ) . Statins inhibit production chemokines C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , molecules involve inflammation ( 7-9 ) . On basis data , several investigator evaluate effect statin therapy several inflammatory disease . Recent study evaluate inflammatory arthritis find statin significantly decrease inflammation animal model ( 10 ) . Statins also appear reduce severity chemically induce peritonitis rat , primarily interfere leukocyte adhesion extravasation ( 11 ) . In human , two small study evaluate use statins patient rheumatoid arthritis several autoimmune disease find short-term use statin associate significant decrease disease activity biochemical marker inflammation ( 12,13 ) . A subsequent randomized , double-blinded study evaluate role atorvastatin 116 patient rheumatoid arthritis find significant reduction number swell joint level several marker inflammation , include ESR CRP , 6 month therapy compare placebo ( 14 ) . This animal human data confirm HMG CoA-reductase inhibitor play role modulate inflammatory pathway , suggest statin may significant therapeutic potential range chronic inflammatory disease . The use pravastatin show inhibit development colitis rat model ( 15 ) . Dextran sulfate ( DSS ) chemical cause intestinal injury give enterally animal , DSS-induced colitis find share many characteristic inflammatory bowel disease . Rats give DSS typically become cachectic , develop hematochezia , develop abnormality intestinal epithelial permeability . Rats develop intestinal injury DSS give concomitantly pravastatin . Pravastatin appear prevent intestinal injury least part increase eNOS expression , typically degrade DSS administration ( 15 ) . This animal model suggest statin could potentially play role reduce inflammation associate active inflammatory bowel disease , could potentially safe well tolerated adjunctive therapy treatment inflammatory bowel disease . This study open label pilot study design ass safety efficacy pravastatin patient active Crohn 's disease . Patients enrol study give pravastatin 80mg daily total six week . The primary endpoint reduction clinical disease activity , measure Harvey-Bradshaw Index ( HBI ) . Patients also assess biochemical marker inflammation completion study assess impact pravastatin marker .</detailed_description>
