	<brief_title>Diffusion Tensor ( Magnetic Resonance ) Imaging Tractography Herniation Cervical Spine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) use confirm disc herniation cervical spine . Symptoms condition change see conventional MR image . Therefore , little gross change see conventional MRI even 6 week treatment , either medical surgical . This study investigate whether new MRI technique , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) tractography , useful demonstrate gross change assess response treatment . Consenting patient refer clinically indicated cervical spine MRI treat physician confirm cervical disc herniation receive additional MRI sequence , diffusion tensor imaging . This provide baseline . The DTI sequence add five minute procedure . Participants return 6 week follow MRI cervical spine include DTI tractography . Participants ask complete anonymized questionnaire enrollment follow provide information regard condition . MRI non-invasive diagnostic study minimal risk use magnet instead ionize radiation acquire image . The image assemble computer . Diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) use water diffusion visualize structure brain nervous system . Tractography perform use DTI computer post-processing track fiber bundle exist brain spinal cord visualize two three dimensional image . Both technique allow radiologist detect abnormality , case , cervical spine disc herniation . The follow study compare baseline study determine demonstrate high sensitivity specificity identify cervical spine abnormality general cervical spine herniation particular .</detailed_description>
