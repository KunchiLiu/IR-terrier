	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Assessment Vismed® ( Sodium Hyaluronate ) Treatment Dry Eye Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VISMED® currently market Europe CE mark viscoelastic lubricant eye drop . The proprietary formulation contain highly purify specific fraction sodium hyaluronate . Sodium hyaluronate natural polymer also present structure human eye . Its main physical characteristic viscoelasticity . This mean VISMED® high viscosity blink low viscosity blink ensure efficient coat surface eye . It believe protective coating surface eye help prevent dryness irritation . Sodium hyaluronate also possess mucoadhesive property ability entrap water , thus resemble tear mucus glycoprotein . This , together coat property sodium hyaluronate , result increase pre-corneal residence time tear film break-up time ( BUT ) therefore long lubrication eye surface . VISMED® completely free preservative . As result , non-irritating ocular tissue use frequently extend period without harm surface eye ( e.g . without cause superficial punctate keratitis ) . Some preservative know cause toxic allergic reaction , symptom include sting , burn redness eye . To maximize patient comfort , pH VISMED® adjust 7.3 , similar natural tear film . Hydrogels sodium hyaluronate use many year ophthalmic surgery Europe U.S. maintain shape eye , cover surgical instrument protect corneal endothelium damage . They unique physical property make ideal use treatment Dry Eye Syndrome . Therefore , VISMED® represent new class compound development treatment dry eye US , offer lubricant property alleviate discomfort reverse ocular damage cause dry eye syndrome . This study conduct supplement body knowledge gain study conduct Europe regulatory approval grant formalize safety efficacy Vismed® meet FDA requirement New Drug Application market product US .</detailed_description>
