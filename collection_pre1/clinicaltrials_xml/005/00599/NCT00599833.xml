	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Giving cetuximab together 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give cetuximab together radiation therapy work treat patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate progression free survival rate patient treat cetuximab radiotherapy . Secondary - To determine response rate , toxicity combine regimen , clinical benefit response patient treat cetuximab radiotherapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour weekly 6-7 week . Patients also undergo concurrent 3-dimensional image-guided conformal radiotherapy 28-30 fraction approximately 5.5-6 week ( 2-4 hour administration cetuximab ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
