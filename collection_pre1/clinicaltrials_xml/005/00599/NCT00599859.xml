	<brief_summary>The genetics lactase divide population 2 phenotype : Those ( LP ) ( LNP ) digest lactose . This division may help modify disease risk accord geographic population distribution . At least putative mechanism risk modification may relate effect undigested lactose lower intestinal bacteria . The effect may provide support beneficial microbe . The amount lactose reach colon make easy LNP LP subject consume large amount meaningful spillover low bowel.The current study examine whether quantifiable qualitative fecal bacterial difference standard intake lactose ( milk sugar ) 2 different phenotypic population . Finding difference would lend support notion diseases LP LNP subject face different risk even area uniform disease risk consume lactose ( find dairy food ) . The primary end point comparison 4 group specific bacteria LP LNP participant 2 week lactose ( powder form mixed water ) consumption . Classification base genetic analysis secondarily breath hydrogen result . Results compare within group . The secondary outcome comparison 4 group bacteria LP LNP subject group stool sample obtain first visit . Results obtain group . Additional information secondary outcomes evaluate relationship diet intake 4 group bacteria first visit Another outcome compare within group effect lactose consumption insulin glucose level within 2 group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Healthy volunteer age 18 49 recruit . 1 . Each participant fill lactose targetting diet questionnaire ( 3 day recall ) . 2 . A 50g lactose challenge tet administer , breath hydrogen symptom record 4.5hrs . 3 . Blood drawn analysis lactase genetic status . 4 . A stool sample collect ( 10-15g ) analyse fo total anaerobe , enterococci , bifidobacteria lactobacillus . 5 . All subject withdraw dairy food ( calcium replacement suggest diet ) 2 week aked return repeat part 2 4 . 6 . A voluntary segment glucose insulin measure 4 hr via indwell venous catheter . 7 . Subjects ask consume 50g lactose divide dos 2 week 8 . At end return repeat section 2 4 third time . 9 . Participants volunteer glucose insulin measure repeat segment study well .</detailed_description>
