	<brief_title>Safety Study TissueGene-C Degenerative Joint Disease Knee</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose first human study investigate safety biological activity intra-articularly applied TissueGene-C patient chronic degenerative joint disease ( DJD ) undergo total knee replacement . In addition , data joint pain , range motion , functionality obtain patient population prior total knee replacement . The primary objective study evaluate safety biological activity intra-articularly administer TissueGene-C evidence observation injection site irritation abnormality affect incidence severity adverse event , change physical examination finding laboratory test compare placebo control . The secondary objective study : 1 . Evaluate dose response hChonJb # 7 cell graft defect compare placebo control . 2 . Evaluate distribution hChonJb # 7 cell injection site . 3 . Evaluate regeneration hyaline cartilage determine histological analysis resect knee tissue . 4 . Evaluate joint evidence tissue overgrowth transformation . 5 . Evaluate biological activity TissueGene-C joint pain , range motion functionality compare placebo control</detailed_description>
