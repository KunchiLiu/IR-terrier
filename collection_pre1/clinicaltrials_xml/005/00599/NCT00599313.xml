	<brief_summary>The purpose research study find effect ( good bad ) Sutent prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Sunitinib Prog Met AIPC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The following rationale make Phase II trial evaluate sunitinib malate ( Sutent ) therapy progressive metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer ( AIPC ) follow prior docetaxel chemotherapy . Since patient metastatic AIPC follow prior chemotherapy clinically progress rapidly , believe achieve 30 % freedom clinical progression ( PFS ) ( include PSA progression ) 12 week represent biologically active therapy . Sunitinib malate ( Sutent ) represent tolerable convenient form therapy potential improving outcome AIPC .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A patient eligible inclusion study meet follow criterion : Histologically confirm , adenocarcinoma prostate Stage IV ( metastatic ) disease , document CT , MRI , Xray Progressive disease ( PSA clinical ) : PSA progression define baseline increase follow serial increase 2 week ; clinical progression symptomatic radiologic criterion . An elevated PSA level patient progress PSA criterion require Currently androgen ablation hormone therapy ( LHRH agonist orchiectomy ) testosterone level &lt; 50ng/dL ) Has receive 1 2 prior chemotherapy regimen ( 2 ) . One prior regimen must docetaxel . Has ECOG Performance Status ( PS ) 02 Is great 18 year age Meets protocol define laboratory value Has adequate cardiac function opinion Investigator Has uncontrolled arrhythmia hypertension Resolution acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy surgical procedure NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 Grade less 1 , opinion Treating Physician If fertile , patient agree use acceptable method birth control prevent pregnancy duration study period 2 month thereafter Has sign Patient Informed Consent Form Has sign Patient Authorization Form A patient exclude study meet follow criterion : Has disease describe inclusion criterion # 1 Had prior treatment Sutent Has receive prior docetaxel current disease Has receive prior radionuclide therapy Has receive prior radiation &gt; 50 % bone marrow Is receive concurrent immunotherapy Has history hypersensitivity component Sutent : mannitol , croscarmellose sodium , povidone ( K25 ) magnesium stearate inactive ingredient . The orange gelatin capsule shell contain titanium dioxide , red iron oxide . The caramel gelatin capsule shell also contain yellow iron oxide black iron oxide . The printing ink contain shellac , propylene glycol , sodium hydroxide , povidone titanium dioxide . Has significant bleed previous 4 week Has follow within prior 6 month : severe/unstable angina , myocardial infarction , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident , transient ischemic attack , pulmonary embolism Is receive concurrent bisphosphonate therapy ; longstanding bisphosphonate therapy ( initiate &gt; 8 week prior registration ) acceptable . Bisphosphonates start within prior 8 week allow since may affect study endpoint render interpretation difficult Has receive treatment radiation therapy , surgery , chemotherapy , ketoconazole , corticosteroid , investigational agent within 4 week prior registration , ( 6 week radiation therapy , nitrosureas Mitomycin C ) Has uncontrolled arrhythmia hypertension Has evidence uncontrolled CNS involvement ( previous radiation steroid acceptable ) Preexisting thyroid abnormality thyroid function maintain normal range medication Has serious uncontrolled intercurrent medical psychiatric illness , include serious infection Has history malignancy within last 5 year ( except cure basal cell carcinoma skin ) , could affect diagnosis assessment study drug Is unable comply requirement study</criteria>
