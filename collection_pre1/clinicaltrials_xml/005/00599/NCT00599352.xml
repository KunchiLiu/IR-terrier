	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine common low level magnesium patient end stage liver disease . In addition , investigator try determine low level magnesium affect release parathyroid hormone patient end stage liver disease low vitamin D level</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypovitaminosis D Inadequate PTH Response Chronic Liver Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypovitaminosis D common condition find patient referred orthotopic liver transplant . The classical physiologic response vitamin D deficiency development secondary hyperparathyroidism . However , several previous study find high incidence inappropriate functional hypoparathyroidism patient chronic liver disease hypovitaminosis D. The mechanism underlie functional hypoparathyroidism understood previous investigator postulate related intracellular magnesium ( Mg ) deficiency . Our short term goal pilot project two fold : ( ) We estimate prevalence magnesium deficiency chronic liver disease patient perform standard Mg load test ( b ) We examine effect acute intravenous Mg infusion calcium-PTH axis . The vitamin D-PTH endocrine system one principal regulator calcium homeostasis bone metabolism . Metabolic bone disease quite pervasive problem chronic liver disease patient . Insight important endocrine system aid u long term goal address metabolic bone disease issue patient population .</detailed_description>
