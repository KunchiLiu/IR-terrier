	<brief_summary>The use R-CHOP , give every two week , associate improvement response rate , progression-free survival , compare R-CHOP give every three week . The addition sargramostim allow safe adminIstration dose-intensified R-CHOP , time , improve functional capability macrophage , thus increase likelihood improve clinical response disease-free survival . The current phase II study propose order develop preliminary data efficacy toxicity approach , future study large , phase III randomize trial . Laboratory correlate response also study , include activation marker monocytes/macrophages sargramostim exposure ; presence absence informative Fc gamma III polymorphism .</brief_summary>

Measurable nonmeasurable tumor parameter ( ) . Nonmeasurable tumor parameter define bidimensional measurement ( i.e . gastric marrow involvement ) follow response diagnostic test gallium , PET image and/or bone marrow biopsy . 5 .

Adequate hepatic function : bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl ( unless elevate secondary lymphomatous involvement liver biliary system . For bilirubin &gt; 3.0 due hepatic involvement , initial dose doxorubicin decrease 50 % , initial dose vincristine omit . SGOT &lt; 5X upper limit normal . 9 . Adequate renal function : creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl , creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min , unless secondary renal involvement lymphoma . 10 . Adequate hematologic function : granulocyte ( ANC ) &gt; 1000/mm3 , platelet &gt; 75,000/dl , unless parameter abnormal secondary lymphomatous involvement bone marrow . All patient must colony stimulate factor therapy least 24 hour prior institution cycle # 1 chemotherapy . 11 . Left ventricular ejection fraction lower institutional limit normal , assessed nuclear scan echocardiogram obtain within 6 week registration . 12 . Concurrent radiation without steroid emergency condition secondary lymphoma ( i.e . CNS tumor , cord compression , etc ) permit , provide additional , measurable evaluable site lymphomatous disease present study entry . 13 . Female patient must negative pregnancy test within 72 hour enter study . Both men woman include , child bear potential , must agree use adequate contraception duration treatment . Women must avoid pregnancy men avoid father child study . 1 . Presence second active tumor , non melanomatous skin cancer , carcinoma situ cervix . 2 . Primary central nervous system lymphoma , include parenchymal brain spinal cord lymphoma . 3 . Pregnant woman nurse mother . 4 . ECOG performance score 3 ( KPS &lt; 50 % ) . 5 . Expected survival &lt; 3 month . 6 . Unable comply requirement protocol , unable provide adequate inform consent opinion principal investigator . 7 . Serious , ongoing nonmalignant disease infection , , opinion investigator and/or sponsor , would compromise protocol objective . 8 . Major surgery , diagnostic surgery , within four week . 9 . History prior therapy Rituximab within 12 month . Patients treat Rituximab 12 month earlier eligible give indication treatment aggressive lymphoma . 10 . History prior cytotoxic chemotherapy radiotherapy lymphoma . 11 . History cutaneous mucocutaneous reaction disease past , due cause , severe enough cause hospitalization inability eat drink 2 day . This exclusion relate longterm possibility severe mucocutaneous cutaneous reaction Rituximab , maybe occur increased frequency patient severe skin disease reaction past . 12 .
