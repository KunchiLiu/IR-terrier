	<brief_summary>Neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause severe vision loss Western world . Intravitreal ranibizumab recently become treatment choice neovascular ( AMD ) . Limitations ranibizumab however include high cost drug need frequent intravitreal re-injections . The investigator ' hypothesis ranibizumab combine transpupillary thermotherapy ( TTT ) number necessary retreatments Lucentis significantly reduce compare ranibizumab alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Ranibizumab Plus Transpupillary Thermotherapy Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) cause ingrowth pathological vessel macula . Experimental study demonstrate vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) centrally involved process . For reason , anti-VEGF drug , particular ranibizumab , become treatment choice neovascular AMD . Ranibizumab use limit high cost . Also , ranibizumab require repeat ( sometimes monthly ) intravitreal injection many year . Strategies reduce burden treatment patient well health care system critical . Combination therapy attractive possibility . Transpupillary thermotherapy ( TTT ) technique vascular occlusion induce deliver radiation near infrared intensity target tissue pupil . Several report indicate TTT may use slow disease progression patient neovascular AMD . In study examine whether combine ranibizumab TTT reduce number ranibizumab injection compare ranibizumab alone ( sham TTT ) . The study go 2 year interim report 1 year .</detailed_description>
