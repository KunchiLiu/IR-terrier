	<brief_summary>In protocol conduct randomize control trial baby respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) yet reach criterion intubation , randomize receive surfactant LMA continue receive standard therapy nasal CPAP supplemental oxygen . All baby give surfactant endotracheal tube reach `` failure '' criterion , standard criterion surfactant administration ( i.e. , FiO2= 65 % receive nasal CPAP ) . The objective RCT determine surfactant successfully administer LMA , thus perhaps avoid need endotracheal intubation . The hypothesis few baby LMA group would reach failure criterion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) illness prematurity result insufficient surfactant lung . Standard therapy RDS place baby oxygen hood nasal CPAP supplemental oxygen , approximately 60 % oxygen require , endotracheal tube place surfactant solution inject tube . An LMA FDA-approved , commercially-available device commonly use substitute endotracheal tube . ( 1 ) The device consist tube , similar endotracheal tube , inflatable donut-shaped cap one end . The cap end LMA place mouth lie larynx cap inflate . The opening tube proximal opening larynx seal structure open pharynx ( e.g. , esophagus ) . The end LMA attach resuscitation bag mechanical ventilator provide lung inflation . This randomize controlled trial , baby moderate RDS , receive surfactant prophylaxis yet require endotracheal intubation large enough accept LMA , randomize either receive surfactant LMA manage standard protocol . Infants weigh &gt; 1200 gm diagnose respiratory distress syndrome minimal moderate lung disease ( i.e. , currently receive nasal CPAP require 30-60 % supplemental oxygen ) eligible . After consent obtain , envelope open infant assign either `` LMA '' `` Standard '' group . Those `` LMA '' group LMA insert routine technique , cuff inflate , baby 's respiration gently assist flow-inflating anesthesia bag . When evident physical examination pulse oximetry respiratory support stable , standard volume Infasurf surfactant ( 3 mL/kg ) inject 2-4 aliquot proximal end LMA . Each aliquot follow gentle positive-pressure assistance anesthesia bag surfactant disappear tube , infant rotate another position prior next aliquot . A minimum lateral position use . After aliquot administer , LMA remove baby return nasal CPAP manage routine protocol . A baby LMA group may receive subsequent LMA treatment he/she require &gt; 10 percentage-point increase supplemental oxygen requirement &gt; 30-minute period . Any subsequent dose give &lt; 6 hour previous dose maximum 3 total LMA dos may give . No LMA surfactant may administer protocol 96 hour age . If baby either group reach `` failure '' criterion , describe , he/she receive standard therapy severe RDS , involve endotracheal intubation administration surfactant endotracheal tube . It estimate approximately half patient standard group go reach failure threshold . `` Failure '' define follow : - FiO2 exceed 65 % 15 minute achieve consistent post-ductal oxygen saturation 88-92 % , OR - Apnea sufficient degree warrant endotracheal intubation , OR - Judgment attend physician endotracheal intubation necessary . All subject reach failure criterion receive endotracheal intubation conventional surfactant therapy Infasurf , unless consider contraindicated attend physician . All patient FiO2 adjust maintain post-ductal oxygen saturation 88-92 % continue receive nasal CPAP either reach failure criterion , FiO2 &lt; 30 % . If subject reach failure criterion , nasal CPAP wean baby place oxygen hood FiO2 = room air . Babies may remove hood return supplemental oxygen clinically indicate .</detailed_description>
