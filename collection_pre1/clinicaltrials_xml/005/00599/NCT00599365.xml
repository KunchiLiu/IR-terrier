	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) serious condition associate premature mortality , decrease quality life , increase health-care cost . An estimated 19 million Americans ( 1 9 US adult ) non-dialysis dependent CKD ( Stages 1-4 ) .1 The health care expenditures care patient CKD substantial . According Centers Medicare Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , estimate annual health cost per patient manage patient CKD markedly high ( $ 28,000 ) compare cost care diabetic patient ( $ 10,000 per patient ) heart failure patient ( $ 5000 per patient ) . 2 According National Kidney Foundation , renal function decline , number renal complication , notably high blood pressure , anemia , malnutrition , mineral bone disorder , increase along severity . A large proportion patient CKD also develop multiple co-morbidities , particularly hypertension , diabetes , hyperlipidemia . Fortunately , accumulate evidence indicate treatment earlier stage chronic kidney disease prevent development kidney failure ( Stage 5 ) 3 . In addition , early prevention cardiovascular risk factor patient CKD may reduce cardiovascular event onset kidney failure.3 Because many patient , particularly later stage CKD , multiple renal complication chronic co-morbidities , patient potentially high risk medication non-adherence non-persistence ( defined premature discontinuation medication therapy ) . Studies demonstrate patient chronic disease typically take 50 % prescribed dose medication , lead increased disease severity , clinic visit , hospital admission , result substantial healthcare expenditures.4,5 In United States alone , cost illness , due non-adherence estimate $ 170 billion per year.6 In addition , associate total cost treating complication result poor adherence dialysis transplant patient exceed $ 950 million.7 Potential barrier medication adherence patient chronic disease include , limited , complex medication regimen , multiple drug dos , treatment asymptomatic condition , cognitive factor . Although well-studied pre-dialysis patient , limited data suggest important cause medication non-adherence chronic dialysis patient include inadequate prescription coverage high medication cost , lack transportation , adverse effect . 8</detailed_description>
