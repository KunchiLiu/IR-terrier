	<brief_title>Pulmonary Function Presentation Follow-up Hemato-Oncology 3-7 Years Old Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) part routine follow-up patient receive anti-cancer treatment . Treatment frequently associate diverse pulmonary damage may become functionally clinically evident many year later . PFTs may help quantify damage lung ; help evaluate point lung function deviate normal allow early intervention irreversible lung damage occur thereby reduce morbidity mortality . Reliable PFTs preschool age traditionally difficult perform , recent publication demonstrate majority preschool child produce reproducible forced expiratory flow volume ( FEVC ) curve proper coach technique . This recent development may enable study long term effect ( year ) treatment lung function young child suffer hemato-oncologic disease .</detailed_description>
