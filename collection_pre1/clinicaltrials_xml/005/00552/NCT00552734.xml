	<brief_summary>140 subject enrol clinical study randomize Control Group Experimental Group block randomization . The subject must meet inclusion none exclusion criterion . Each subject 7 clinic visit 3 phone visit . The Baseline Visit consist complete history , vitals , physical examination completion consent screen process . All clinic visit , except Baseline Visit include meter/PDA download . In addition , meter education provide subject , PDA education provide Experimental group Baseline Visit 2-Week Visit need ensure subject understanding . The phone visit consist history include change insulin dose , hypoglycemic event , hyperglycemic event , adverse event occur since last clinic visit . The primary endpoint study show reduction A1c least 0.4 % high insulin guidance software group 6 month and/or 1 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improved Glycemic Control Adult Subjects With Type 1 Diabetes MDI Using Insulin Guidance Software</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Design Methods A total 123 adult subject type 1 diabetes baseline A1c 7.5-11 % enrol study Barbara Davis Center Childhood Diabetes University Colorado Denver Health Sciences Center . Two patient screen fail ( entry criterion meet ) randomization , leave 60 subject randomize control group 61 subject randomized experimental group ( Advisor ) . Subjects randomize base lottery system use sealed envelope . All patient baseline blood work include complete blood count ( CBC ) , complete metabolic panel ( CMP ) , creatnine kinase ( CK ) A1c . The mean A1c baseline 8.54 ±0.11 control group 8.42 ±0.11 experimental group ( p=0.4265 ) . Subjects randomized 1:1 basis either experimental control group . All subject experimental group receive train insulin guidance software program personal data assistant ( PDA ) . All subject give glucose meter unlimited supply test strip self monitor blood glucose ( SMBG ) . Women pregnant planning become pregnant excluded participation study patient insulin pump , take glucocorticoid therapy , diagnose cancer , liver disease , anemia hepatitis . Patients exercise five day week , often travel internationally also exclude . The protocol approve Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board ( COMIRB ) . All subject sign informed consent form enrol study . Visits All subject ask attend 7 clinic visit ( baseline , 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month 12 month ) participate 3 telephone visit ( 4.5month , 7.5month , 9.5 month ) throughout course study . Data blood glucose value , test frequency , hyperglycemic excursion , hypoglycemic event ( , nocturnal , severe ) , insulin dose , weight BMI , hospitalization , emergency room visit illness record clinic visit . All subject complete patient satisfaction questionnaire experimental group also complete Advisor questionnaire . As part routine clinical care , additional phone visit equally encourage group . Advisor Insulin Guidance Software ( Figure 1a ) Subjects randomized experimental group receive PDA load insulin guidance software . At baseline ( visit 1 ) , healthcare provider and/or certify diabetes educator ( CDE ) review feature software PDA load subject specific insulin dose algorithm software base physician 's recommendation . The software program allow healthcare provider enter demographic data age , height weight could potentially affect insulin sensitivity factor already programmed device . The program advise basal , bolus correction insulin dosage base individual patient ' prescription addition alert SMBG test . Subjects experimental group also ask input blood glucose value PDA via touch screen . Subjects receive recommended insulin dose base prescription program healthcare provider . The patient ask either agree recommended insulin dose disagree , manually enter insulin dose take give event . All data glucose meter PDAs download every visit . Glucose Target Ranges Glucose value capture one follow category assess target glycemia pie chart create . Within Target Range ( WTR ) glucose value 70-150mg/dL ( 3.89 8.33 mmol/L ) ( 20 ) . Below Target Range ( BTR ) glucose value define ≤ 69mg/dL ( 3.83 mmol/L ) Above Target Range ( ATR ) glucose value value 150mg/dL ( 8.33 mmol/L ) . These glucose level choose base previous research SMBG download ( 20 ) . Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia define glucose value ≤ 59mg/dL ( 3.27mmol/L ) . Severe hypoglycemia define subject need assistance previously describe DCCT Research Group ( 1 ) . A1c Other Lab Measurement The A1c value measure DCA 2000® Analyzer , distribute Bayer Corporation ( Elkhart , IN ) . The DCA 2000® A1c assay give accurate precise result range total hemoglobin 7 24 g/dL . All subject hemoglobin concentration well within value . Normal A1c value 3.4 6.2 % ( 18 ) . The CBC ( Beckman Coulter LH750 , Beckman Coulter , Hialeah , FL ) , CMP ( AU-5200 Olympus Japan Co Ltd , Tokyo ) CK ( Olympus AU-800 ; Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) perform Quest Diagnostics , Denver , Colorado . Statistical Analysis Wilcoxon Rank Sum Chi Square test independence use compare continuous categorical variable , respectively , baseline . Chi Square test independence use compare number discontinue subject two group . Mixed model repeat measure analysis unstructured covariance structure pre-planned contrast use compare experimental control group A1c , percent glucose reading within , , target , percent total hypoglycemic event , basal insulin dose , weight , BMI . Paired t-tests use test within group change weight baseline 12 month among complete 12 month . Fisher 's Exact test use compare number patient achieve target value group time point . Poisson regression use compare frequency severe hypoglycemic event two group . Data present least square mean ± SE unless otherwise note . All analysis perform use SAS 9.1 . Results consider significant p &lt; 0.05 use two-sided alpha .</detailed_description>
