	<brief_summary>Development new treatment diseases multiple myeloma focus research . The research conduct treatment call Anti-KIR ( 1-7F9 ) , activate body 's cell kill tumor cell . This different many treatment chemical give kill tumor cell . The purpose study determine safe dose Anti-KIR ( 1-7F9 ) administer human gain information effectiveness treatment multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-label , Dose-escalation Safety Tolerability Trial Assessing Anti-KIR ( 1-7F9 ) Subjects With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trial Design : The trial open-label , dose-escalation trial determine safety tolerability Anti-KIR ( 1-7F9 ) subject relapse refractory multiple myeloma ( RRMM ) . A 3+3 design employ first dose cycle dose level . The 7 plan dose level 0.0003 mg/kg , 0.003 mg/kg , 0.015 mg/kg , 0.075 mg/kg , 0.3 mg/kg , 1.0 mg/kg 3.0 mg/kg . The subject receive total 4 administration Anti-KIR ( 1-7F9 ) dose interval administration 4 week . Safety , toxicity , PK ( pharmacokinetic ) PD ( pharmacodynamic ) obtain first 4 week dose per group basis dose-escalation decision . There follow-up visit every week one month first administration every two week follow second , third fourth administration . After last administration follow-up visit every month KIR occupancy longer detect .</detailed_description>
