	<brief_summary>Renal transplantation treatment choice chronic renal insufficiency arrive final stage . Tacrolimus immunosuppressant treatment use prevention episode acute rejection . Tacrolimus characterize narrow therapeutic index important interindividual variation pharmacokinetic characteristic . Proteins CYP3A4 CYP3A5 responsible intestinal hepatic metabolism Tacrolimus . Various polymorphisms CYP3A5 CYP3A4 describe several retrospective study suggest association genetic polymorphism CYP3A5 pharmacokinetic parameter Tacrolimus . In particular , show presence allele CYP3A5*1 associate use important amount Tacrolimus obtain desired blood concentration . This study national , multicentric , prospective , open , randomize two arm treatment . 280 receiver renal transplant 12 centre include . The genotyping gene CYP3A5 carry 6 day follow transplantation . During first week , patient treat basiliximab , MMF corticosteroid . They randomize ( central randomization ) D6 receive either Tacrolimus 0.2 mg/kg/d , dosage adapt genotype . After determination first residual blood concentration Tacrolimus realize six oral intake , daily amount Tacrolimus could modify necessary reach desire blood concentration . The total duration study patient 3 month transplantation . The objective study evaluate impact adaptation , accord genotype CYP3A5 patient , first amount Tacrolimus first residual blood concentration Tacrolimus , keep mind aim individualization dosage schedule pharmacogenetic approach . Principal criterion : Comparison , two group , percentage patient first blood concentration Tacrolimus evaluate 3 day ( D10 ) first administration Tacrolimus range 10 15 ng/ml . Statistics carry intention treat . The principal criterion analyze test chi-2 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inclusion criterion - Patients , male female , 18 65 year old . - Patients receive first second isolate renal graft come donor alive decease , - The patient age procreate must negative test pregnancy include study agree use effective contraceptive measurement throughout study . - Patients able include/understand aim risk study , fully inform give write consent take part study . Patients unable write and/or read fully understood oral information give investigator give oral consent presence independent witness . Non-inclusion criterion - Patients receive several graft . - Patients require treatment azathioprin . - Pregnant woman nurse mother - Patients receive incompatible graft ABO . - Patients receive require immunosuppressant drug prohibit protocol . - Patients peak historical antibody equal great 50 % panel . - Patients suffer serious gastro-intestinal disorder interfere capacity receive absorb oral form patient present severe diarrhoea . - Patients symptomatic GI ulcer - HIV HTLV1 positive patient donor - Patients present present 5 last year one several malignant tumour , except baso spinocellular cutaneous epithelioma successfully treat . - Patients systemic infection require treatment entry study . - Patients leukocyte numeration lower 2,5.109/l haemoglobin low 5g/dl . - Patients drug-addiction whatever , psychiatric disorder , accord point view investigator , could invalidate communication investigator interfere compliance patient . - Patients take part simultaneously another therapeutic test receive study treatment le 30 day entry study . - Patients already include study . - Patients allergic intolerant corticoid , macrolides , Tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil basiliximab The inclusion period plan 15 month . The inclusion patient take place transplantation . After transplantation , centralize genotyping CYP3A5 carry patient . A sample blood take day transplantation . The randomization carry accord 1:1 mode , unequal block stratify center accord group A ( Tacrolimus give D7 , dosage:0,20 mg/kg/d ) versus group B ( manage Tacrolimus give D7 dosage adapt genotype CYP3A ) . VISITS The participation patient study 3 month . For period , 7 visit plan . D0 consider day closing skin . - Before transplantation Visit 1 : inclusion visit ( 4 day transplantation ) The day transplantation blood take carry EDTA tube CYP 3 A5 genotyping - After transplantation ( D0 = day close skin ) - Visit 2 : J6 ( randomization ) - Visit 3 : J10 - Visit 4 : J14 - Visit 5 : M1 + - 3 day - Visit 6 : M2 + - 3 day - Visit 7 : M3 + - 7 day TREATMENTS : -Tacrolimus In two arm treatment Tacrolimus give D7 post transplantation accord group randomization . The first dosage schedule Tacrolimus different accord group randomization : - Group A : 0,10 mg/kg 2 time per day patient - Group B : - 0,125 mg/kg 2 time per day ( CYP3A5 *1/*1 *1/*3 ) - 0,075 mg/kg 2 time per day ( CYP3A5*3/*3 ) A first residual blood concentration ( C0 ) Tacrolimus evaluate 6 administration PrografÂ® , D10 . The dosage schedule Tacrolimus adapt freely accord therapeutic pharmacological follow-up Tacrolimus specify protocol , say 10 15 ng/ml , whatever group randomization . - Basiliximab All patient receive two injection basiliximab per intravenous way ( first injection transplantation second injection D4 ) ,20 Mg intake . - Corticotherapy decrease amount follow : - D0 : 500 Mg - D1 : 125 Mg - D2 - D15 : 20 Mg - D16 - M1 : 15 Mg - M1 - M3 : 10 Mg - MMF The MMF give 3 gr . per day first 15 day , 2 G per day adapt accord clinical biological tolerance . During study follow treatment authorize : - immunosuppressant propose ; ciclosporin , sirolimus , azathioprine , plasmatic exchange ; intravenous immunoglobulin . - Gastric bandage [ gastric protection ( inhibitor H+ pump ) authorize ] . - Treatments present interaction P-glycoprotein cytochrome P450 3A - Any drug marketing authorization . All concomitant drug take patient study must write CRF drug patient would take 7 day transplantation . The analysis test do end inclusion patient accord principle Intention To Treat Analysis . The patient able excluded analysis : - patient take amount evaluated drug - patient without data collect randomization An analysis per-protocol carry . From analysis could exclude additional way precede analysis : - declare patient compliants - patient leave study another reason inefficiency treatment undesirable event - patient take study one prohibit treatment influence effectiveness . STATISTIC Calculation necessary number subject : One define success : The event `` blood concentration Tacrolimus 10 15 ng/ml 6 administration per bone '' One define failure : The event `` blood concentration Tacrolimus 10 15 ng/ml 6 administration per bone '' . The awaited percentage event 40 % group A ( dosage schedule Tacrolimus accord recommendation : 0,20/kg/d ) . It make assumption adaptation dosage schedule Tacrolimus accord genetics increase success rate 60 % . By set alpha risk = 5 % , beta risk = 10 % , bilateral formulation , balance randomization ( 1/1 ) , necessary include 140 subject group show absolute difference 20 % success 2 group , say 1 year inclusion 1 year 3 month study .</detailed_description>
