	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Polyheal-1 Treatment Recalcitrant Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic ulcer affect million people , grow clinical problem see frequently elderly . Non-healing slow healing wound represent major health burden drain resource , contribute substantial disability , morbidity , cost . Wound heal involves well-orchestrated , complex process lead repair injured tissue . Basic principle good wound care involve removal necrotic tissue mechanical , surgical enzymatic debridement , wound bed preparation , treatment infection . In general , wound appropriately manage show measurable progress within 2-4 week . However despite deliver good wound care include provide right dressing , nutritional support , topical care , offer top-of-the-line support surface , wound often become stagnated . Wounds refractory treatment 2-4 week dub recalcitrant . Such wound need sometime stimuli start heal cascade . Polyheal-1 , think potentially useful trigger heal process particularly beneficial stimulate granulation process chronic wound different etiology e.g . venous , diabetic wound , decubitus ulcer post trauma/surgery complicate wound . For instance expose bone tendon particularly difficult treat , previously demonstrate benefit stimulation granulation coverage application Polyheal 1 . In protocol intent perform comparative study aim compare performance Polyheal I Saline treatment recalcitrant wound different etiology venous various post-operative wound include case expose bone need granulation coverage . Furthermore , patient post- operative surgical complication sternum partial foot amputation diabetic patient also subject present investigation . Polyheal 1 compare saline commonly use treatment intend keep wound moist enable progress granulation epithelization .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient 18 year age old . The patient least one recalcitrant wound ( venous insufficiency , post operative posttraumatic chronic wound different etiology include open wound ) refractive heal least 4 week prior treatment Patients define grade 4 granulometer include wound expose bone tendon . Patients eligible participate study target lesion area edge large 15cm2 small 200 cm2 baseline group A wound cause venous insufficiency large 2cm2 small 200 cm2 baseline group B postoperative post traumatic chronic wound expose bone , tendon and/or ligament . The patient expect available 12 week study . Clinically significant arterial vascular disease ABI index &lt; 0.45 peripheral pulse palpable . Wound necrotic tissue cover 50 % wound area . Neuropathic wound diabetic origin . Roentgenic ( Xray ) evidence osteomyelitis target wound case bone detectable insertion wire . Diabetic patient HbA1c &gt; 11 % Presence systemic infection significant local infection cellulite , purulent drainage , gangrene , necrosis target wound site , well nonviable tissue , sinus tract tunnel remove debridement . Previous history illness condition may impair wound healing , immune deficiency connective tissue disease ( e.g. , SLE , AIDS ) , neurological disease ( e.g. , multiple sclerosis ) , dialysis due renal disease active hepatic disease . Patient receiving , receive within one month prior Visit 1 treatment know impair wound healing , include limited : corticosteroid , immuno suppressive drug , cytotoxic agent , radiation therapy chemotherapy . Patient history alcohol drug abuse within last two year . Presence suspicion malignancy . Treatment dress contain growth factor biological dressing within 15 day , prior screen visit . Female patient pregnant nursing , childbearing potential use adequate contraception . Participation another clinical trial within 30 day prior Screening Visit study .</criteria>
