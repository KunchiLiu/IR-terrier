	<brief_summary>Childhood Lead Poisoning widespread disease effective treatment . The specific aim propose clinical trial threefold : - To determine whether six-week course newly formulate d-penicillamine suspension effectively reduce blood lead level child age 6 month 16 year blood lead level 15-25 μg/dL . - To determine whether d-penicillamine chelation produce sustain reduction blood lead level comparison succimer lead chelators always produce significant post-treatment `` rebound '' . - To determine whether chelation d-penicillamine improves physiologic disturbance measure child blood lead level range .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approximately 300,000 child US elevate blood lead level ( 10 mcg/dl great ) . Lead poison child unequivocally harmful , produce neurodevelopmental consequence cognitive loss , attentional difficulty behavioral disturbance , include antisocial delinquent tendency . Non-neurodevelopmental consequence lead poison include impairment heme synthesis , reduction 1- hydroxylation 25 ( OH ) - cholecalciferol ( Vitamin D precursor ) renal injury result microproteniuria , increase risk hypertension great likelihood renal failure adulthood . Despite well-defined toxicity , treatment childhood lead poisoning inadequate . Currently , chelation therapy uniformly recommend child severe lead poisoning ( blood lead &gt; 45 mcg/dl ) . Approved chelate agent severe plumbism CaNa2EDTA succimer . For child blood lead level less 45 mcg/dl treatment fraught difficulty include inconsistent recommendation clinical expert , lack proven benefit chelation absence chelate agent approve use range . d-Penicillamine lead chelator use off-label almost 4 decade . Several study suggest d-penicillamine safe effective treatment low-level lead poisoning . We propose evaluate , Phase II/III randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial , effectiveness d-penicillamine 50 child age 6 month 16 year blood lead level 15-25 mcg/dl . The d-penicillamine product newly develop , IND-approved liquid formulation . The study perform Pediatric Environmental Health Center Children 's Hospital Boston . The primary outcome measure ability 6-week course d-penicillamine produce sustain reduction blood lead level . Secondary outcome measure normalization non-neurodevelopmental physiologic aberration know occur lead poisoning , specifically abnormalities heme Vitamin D synthesis . If clinical trial demonstrate safety efficacy , d-penicillamine potentially provide another option among limited treatment choice lead-poisoned child . This trial also provide basis examine drug 's efficacy improve neurodevelopment outcome child expose harmful amount lead .</detailed_description>
