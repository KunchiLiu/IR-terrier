	<brief_summary>To assess whether period prophylactic penicillin episode cellulitis leg reduces risk repeat episode . Participants randomise receive 12 month prophylaxis ( penicillin VK 250mg b.d . placebo ) . The PATCH I study recruit patient recurrent disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RCT Investigate Prophylactic Antibiotics Prevent Further Episodes Cellulitis ( Erysipelas ) Leg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cellulitis leg common , acute , painful potentially serious infection skin subcutaneous tissue . It currently account 2-3 % UK hospital admission . The average length in-patient stay 9 day ( Hospital Episode Statistics , Department Health ( UK ) , 2002-2003 ) 25-50 % treated patient suffer episodes morbidity , oedema ulceration . Cellulitis low leg usually due streptococcal infection enter body via relatively subtle portal , toeweb fissure . Penicillin useful commonly use oral antibiotic streptococci , although agent flucloxacillin often use staphylococcal infection clinical possibility . There numerous risk factor cellulitis low leg recurrent disease one big problem . Existing evidence use prophylactic antibiotic prevent episodes limit . Two small randomise control trial ( RCTs ) hint possible benefit , study small ( 16 40 participant respectively ) . Despite , many physician routinely use prophylactic antibiotic recurrent cellulitis , although opinion value practice firmly divide . This study recruit 12-24 month period participant complete therapy current episode cellulitis . Participants follow 24 month telephone call 10 day , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month 12 month every 6 month complete intervention . A diary also provide `` aid memoir '' phone call note miss tablet recurrence cellulitis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis cellulitis either leg AND history least one previous episode cellulitis either leg within three Any doubt certainty diagnosis either index episode previous episode ( applicable ) , ground exclusion . Additionally , patient follow exclude : Taken antibiotic prophylaxis ( defined 3 month usage ) prevention cellulitis within 6 month prior index episode . A time lapse longer 12 week since start treatment index episode date potential randomisation trial . Known allergy penicillin . Preceding leg ulceration , surgery penetrating trauma , case likely cause staphylococcal infection . ( NB : exclude patient toeweb maceration/tinea pedis minor/blunt wound ) . Treating physician principal investigator unwilling randomise patient . This include , limited : The treat physician and/or patient feel prophylactic antibiotic patient 's best interest therefore entry study would inappropriate . The treat physician and/or patient feel would ethical appropriate patient receive placebo willing/able accept randomisation Concomitant medication would mean longterm penicillin inappropriate Diagnostic uncertainty Gastrointestinal disease cause persistent diarrhoea vomit severe enough affect absorption phenoxymethylpenicillin . Allergic diathesis severe bronchial asthma severe enough preclude use phenoxymethylpenicillin . Confounding concurrent disease ( e.g . DVT ) . No access telephone . Aged le 16 year . Unable give inform consent . Already take part research study .</criteria>
