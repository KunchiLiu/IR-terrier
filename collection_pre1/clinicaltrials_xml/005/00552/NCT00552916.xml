	<brief_title>Functional Electrical Stimulation ( FES ) Assisted Walking : Enhancement Walking Function After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A stroke devastate life event , result permanent disability . Many people survive stroke experience paralysis one side body . The muscle one leg may become weak stiff point person barely walk . Functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) intervention applies short current pulse muscle cause contract . Previous work do team use FES spinal cord injure population help restore function walk grasp contract group paralyze muscle orchestrate manner . This study seek explore whether thrice weekly FES-assisted walk intervention 8 week period stimulate improve walk ability individual severe low extremity paralysis secondary stroke . This subsequently promote opportunity enhance social participation quality life i.e . enhanced balance , increase independence activity daily live etc . stroke consumer . Comparison : 40 individual severe hemiplegia randomize either thrice weekly control ( false ) FES train regimen OR thrice weekly intervention ( true ) FES train regimen . Prior randomization , participant stratify accord ability ambulate ( walk ) . This study determine FES improve enhance walk ability associate stroke 8 week training , 4-month follow-up period .</detailed_description>
