	<brief_summary>Background : Family member ( spouse , sibling , offspring ) patient coronary heart disease ( CHD ) may increase risk develop CHD genetic , biochemical and/or behavioural reason . Targeted approach aim family member establish CHD may cost-effective way identify high-risk person link effective risk factor modification . During pilot test find 29 % family member patient recently hospitalize institution ≥ 3 CHD risk factor . Encouragingly , indicate high level `` readiness '' change underlie risk behaviour cigarette smoke physical inactivity . We develop 12-week family heart health program feature personal plan achieve risk factor goal weekly contact heart health educator . This intervention need fully test . Research Aims : In study , : 1 . Compare effect target family heart health ( FHH ) screening , counsel follow-up program versus usual care ( UC ) reduce participant total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein ( TC/HDL ) ratio 52 week program entry , family member patient recently hospitalize CHD ; 2 . Compare effect FHH program versus UC modifiable component comprise Framingham score , include : smoking status ; systolic blood pressure ; total cholesterol ; high density lipoprotein cholesterol ; 3 . Compare effect FHH program versus UC : lifestyle-related factor ( dietary pattern , leisure time exercise , body composition ) ; medication use ( anti-lipemic medication , anti-hypertensive medication , pharmacotherapies smoke cessation ) ; use healthcare resource ( physician visit , hospitalization day , number laboratory diagnostic test procedure ) .</brief_summary>
