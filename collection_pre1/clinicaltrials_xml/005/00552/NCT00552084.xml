	<brief_title>Evaluating Effectiveness Fish Oil Supplements Reducing Recurrence Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AF common type serious heart arrhythmia . It affect approximately 2 % population become common . In AF , heart 's atrium , upper chamber , contract disorganize abnormal manner unable correctly pump blood heart 's ventricle , low chamber . Symptoms may include rapid irregular pulse , dizziness , fainting , breathe difficulty . Recent study suggest inflammation play fundamental role development AF . Inflammation , result oxidative stress , cause cellular tissue damage . In turn , may alter heart function , potentially leading onset recurrence AF . Markers inflammation , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , often elevated patient AF , provide evidence inflammation 's role . While several treatment option AF , usually moderately effective . Previous research show fish oil supplement anti-inflammatory , antifibrotic , antioxidant effect reduce risk AF follow surgery . However , know exactly fish oil reduces risk whether positive effect carry people experience common type AF unrelated surgery . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness fish oil supplementation decrease recurrence AF adult undergone recent surgery . Researchers also examine way fish oil reduces AF recurrence . This study enroll people least two occurrence AF . Participants randomly assign receive either fish oil supplement placebo 24 week . At study visit baseline Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 18 , 24 , participant undergo medical social history review , physical exam , blood urine collection . At baseline study visit , electrocardiogram also occur .</detailed_description>
