	<brief_title>Antioxidation Medication Noise-induced Hearing Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both genetic environmental factor contribute noise-induced hearing loss ( NIHL ) . The cellular antioxidant system appear protect cochlear hair cell oxidative stress due noise . Previous animal study show protective effect anti-oxidant medicine NIHL.The objective study test hypothesis preventive medication antioxidation relate susceptibility NIHL . The 53 noise-exposed worker steel industry Taiwan recruit , divide N-Acetylcysteine ( NAC ) ( Acetine , 1200mg/day ) group placebo one . The duration medication 2 week initially . After washout 2 week , kind medication 2 group crossover use 2 week . Firstly , questionnaire interview noise exposure , smoking , alcohol drinking , drug habit history calculation Body Mass Index ( BMI ) do . The following method would perform individually medication . With detailed local examination otoscope , subject receive hear test pure-tone audiometry ( PTA ) distortion product otoacoustic emission ( DPOAE ) daily work . The possible confounding factor include background noise , solvent , heavy metal , carbon monoxide temperature workplace assess . The amount noise exposure evaluate personal dosimeter . Early morning , Blood sample collect . Deletion polymorphism Glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) T1 GSTM1 gene determine . Statistical analysis perform evaluate relation intake anti-oxidant medicine noise-induced temporal threshold shift ( TTS ) . The expected result study determine whether anti-oxidant supplement protect worker noise-induced TTS . We anticipate human study might help elucidate relative importance anti-oxidant enzyme risk factor NIHL .</detailed_description>
