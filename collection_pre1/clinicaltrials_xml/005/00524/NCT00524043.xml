	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study One Dosage Paliperidone Extended Release ( ER ) Treating Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , treatment acute symptom schizophrenia less ideal , one-third patient schizophrenia respond current treatment , poor drug tolerability decrease patient 's ability remain treatment . Paliperidone ER dose range 3 mg/day 12 mg/day approve treatment patient schizophrenia . A low dosage form paliperidone ER efficacious may reduce risk certain adverse effect . This study evaluate efficacy 1 fix ( ie , change study ) dosage paliperidone ER ( 1.5 mg/day ) compare placebo . One fixed dosage paliperidone ER ( 6.0 mg/day ) give patient active ( already show efficacy ) control . This multicenter , double-blind ( neither patient study-site personnel know treatment patient receiving ) , randomize ( patient assign treatment group chance ) , placebo-controlled ( patient receive placebo active drug ) , parallel-group ( patient group follow study design ) study adult diagnose schizophrenia least 1 year screen experience acute episode . The study start up-to-5-day screen phase find patient eligible study . The screening phase include 3- 5-day washout ( medication dosage taper finally stop ) medication take patient allow study . A 6-week double-blind treatment phase follow finish end-of-study visit . A post-study visit collect additional safety data schedule 1 week patient receive last dose study drug . The length entire study 8 week . Patients withdraw study complete double-blind treatment phase complete end-of-study visit procedure time withdraw post-study visit 1 week receive last dose study drug . For patient leave study , investigator make every effort see receive adequate continuity care . At baseline ( visit patient take first dose study drug ) , patient randomly assign 1 3 possible treatment group receive paliperidone ER 1.5 mg/day , paliperidone ER 6 mg/day , placebo daily 6 week . Patients must voluntary inpatient time randomization , must remain hospital minimum 8 day . Efficacy measure use follow rating scale : Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) , Clinical Global Impression-Severity ( CGI-S ) , Personal Social Performance Scale ( PSP ) , Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey-36 ( MOS SF-36 ) . Safety evaluate use physical examination , ECGs , clinical laboratory testing ( hematology , serum chemistry , urinalysis ) , testings pregnancy , monitor adverse event include extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) use Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) , Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale ( BARS ) , Simpson-Angus Rating Scale ( SAS ) . The study hypothesis Paliperidone ER 1.5 mg per day effective treatment schizophrenia measure change total PANSS score baseline endpoint comparison placebo . Oral paliperidone ER 1.5 mg 6.0 mg tablet match oral placebo tablet take daily morning 6 week .</detailed_description>
