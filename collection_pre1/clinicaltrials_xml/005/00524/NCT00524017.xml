	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block abnormal cell growth different way . Some block ability abnormal cell grow spread . Others find abnormal cell help kill carry cell-killing substance . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well cetuximab work treat patient precancerous lesion upper aerodigestive tract .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab Treating Patients With Precancerous Lesions Upper Aerodigestive Tract</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine histologic response rate patient high-risk , premalignant lesion upper aerodigestive tract treat cetuximab . Secondary - To determine clinical response rate patient . - To determine pattern EGFR component expression alter patient . - To determine change status genetic alteration , include loss heterozygosity , patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratified lesion type ( diffuse dysplasia v recurrent dysplasia v dysplastic lesion 3p 9p loss heterozygosity [ LOH ] ) . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . - Arm I ( treatment ) : Patients receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 43 , 50 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II ( control ) : Patients receive regular follow-up care . Patients option receive cetuximab completion study . In arm , patient persistent recurrent high-grade dysplasia dysplastic lesion 3p 9p LOH undergo surgical resection , feasible , week 8 . Tumor biopsy sample obtain baseline* week 8 histologic biomarker correlative study . Tissue sample analyze histopathology determine histologic change post-treatment lesion IHC measure expression activation EGFR signal pathway component . LOH study also perform . NOTE : *Paraffin-embedded tissue original diagnostic biopsy may use baseline assessment , diagnostic biopsy perform within 3 month prior study entry . After completion study therapy , patient follow approximately 1 month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 5 year per routine standard care .</detailed_description>
