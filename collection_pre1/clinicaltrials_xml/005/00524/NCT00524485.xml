	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Photodynamic therapy use drug becomes active expose certain kind light . When drug active , abnormal cell kill . Photodynamic therapy use topical aminolevulinic acid may effective actinic keratosis . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study well different photodynamic therapy regimens use topical aminolevulinic acid work treat patient actinic keratosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy Using Topical Aminolevulinic Acid Treating Patients With Actinic Keratosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine , use fluorescence measurement , protoporphyrin IX ( PpIX ) accumulation thin actinic keratoses ( AK ) actinically damage skin face , scalp , upper torso ( stratum 1 ) PpIX accumulation thick AK actinically damage skin arm leg ( stratum 2 ) function skin preparation , aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) application time , body site . - To determine extent PpIX photobleached treatment light . Secondary - To assess effect different treatment condition acute reaction AK sun damage skin ALA-photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) occur 24-48 hour PDT . - To assess effect different treatment condition efficacy ALA-PDT . - To examine histological response ALA-PDT . - To determine , use fluorescence measurement , PpIX accumulation incidental thick AK may occur stratum 1 , PpIX accumulation incidental thin AK may occur stratum 2 function skin preparation , ALA application time body site . - To determine extent PpIX incidental lesion photobleached treatment light . OUTLINE : The randomization two-step restrict block process application time skin preparation , follow randomization light dose ( 1 vs 2 pulse ) within anatomic site . Within stratum ( stratum 1 2 ) , lesion separate anatomic area ( face neck , scalp , upper torso ; arm , leg ) randomize receive 1 3 pretreatment skin preparation receive topical aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) : pretreatment acetone , gentle abrading , pretreatment . Patients randomize receive ALA different time photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) . - Arm I : Patients receive topical ALA 2 hour PDT . - Arm II : Patients receive topical ALA 4 hour PDT . - Arm III : Patients receive topical ALA 24 hour PDT . Each anatomic area divide subunit ( e.g. , right left arm , right leave side face ) . The subunit randomize receive 1 2 pulse laser treatment . - Arm IV : 1 Vbeam laser pulse ( photodynamic therapy ) apply subunit . - Arm V : 2 Vbeam laser pulse ( photodynamic therapy ) apply subunit . Patients may receive 3 treatment ( include pretreatment , ALA , PDT ) least 1 month apart . Patients progressive lesion lesion respond 3 treatment may receive diagnostic biopsy check invasive squamous cell carcinoma refer treatment study . Patients undergo biopsy baseline , ALA application prior light treatment , 24 hour light treatment analyze cytokine gene specific actinic keratoses .</detailed_description>
