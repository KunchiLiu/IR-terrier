	<brief_title>A Proof Concept Study Effectiveness Carisbamate Treatment Essential Tremor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hypothesis study carisbamate effective treatment Essential Tremor compare placebo measure Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale ( TRS ) . This randomize ( study medication assign chance ) study 3 Phases : Screening/Washout , Double Blind Treatment ( physician patient know name study medication ) , Exit . The Double Blind Treatment Phase 2 Treatment Periods . Since cross-over study , subject complete full Double Blind Treatment Phase opportunity take carisbamate . Carisbamate administer 100 mg oral tablet . During Treatment Period 1 , patient take 2 tablet assign study medication ( either carisbamate placebo ) two time day 21 day . Patients return clinical evaluation approximately 1 week start study medication end Treatment Period 1 . Patients reduce dose study medication 1 tablet twice day 3 day prior stop study medication least 11 day . Before enter Treatment Period 2 , patient return clinical evaluation . During Treatment Period 2 , patient take 2 tablet assign study medication two time day 21 day . Patients return clinical evaluation approximately 1 week start second study medication end Treatment Period 2 . Patients reduce study medication 1 tablet twice day 3 day stop study medication . Patients return clinical evaluation approximately 1 week stop study medication contact telephone approximately 30 day last dose study medication . Safety assess study visit monitor adverse event , clinical laboratory testing , physical neurological examination electrocardiograms . Patients take 2 carisbamate 100mg tablet 2 time day ( 400 mg/day ) 21 day one Treatment Period 2 match placebo tablet 2 time day 21 day Treatment Period .
