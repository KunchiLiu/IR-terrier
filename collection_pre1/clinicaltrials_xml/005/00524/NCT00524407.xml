	<detailed_description>This study open-label ( patient investigator know treatment give ) , randomize ( patient assign treatment group chance ) study lymphoma , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , multiple myeloma patient . This study address clinical patient-management consequence treat mild moderate anemia ( hemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 12 g/dL ) . The design study compare effect treat high Hb level current standard care criterion Hb level , transfusion requirement , patient report outcome ( quality life , health care resource utilization , productivity ) . Patients randomize accord Hb level . Two entry criterion specify course trial . Initially , patient enrol Hb level &gt; = 11 g/dL randomize receive 1 ) Immediate epoetin alfa treatment 2 ) Observed Hb level fell 11 g/dL . Epoetin alfa treatment provide Observed group Hb level fell 9.0 g/dL . Slow recruitment patient study result protocol amendment . Subsequently , patient present Hb 10 12 g/dL , patient randomize Immediate Observed group . Patients present Hgb &gt; 12 g/dL otherwise eligible , randomized Hb drop &lt; =12 g/dL . Patients remain study 36 week . Safety assessment perform throughout study include obtain evaluate laboratory test , vital sign ( e.g. , blood pressure ) , occurrence severity adverse event . The start dose PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) administer subcutaneously ( sc ) 40,000 Units ( U ) weekly ( qw ) . If 3-4 week therapy , Hb increase &gt; 1.0 g/dL , dose increase 60,000 U sc qw . If time , Hb rise 15 g/dL 2 consecutive evaluation , PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) stop Hb drop 13 g/dL resume .</detailed_description>
