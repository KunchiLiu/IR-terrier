Have either measurable evaluable disease . Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) 01 ( Refer Section 11.4 ) . Have LVEF within institutional range normal measure either echocardiogram ( ECHO ) MUGA scan . The modality must use consistently throughout study . Be deem able tolerate 8 cycle preoperative chemotherapy , include 4 cycle anthracycline ( epirubicin ) . Must willing undergo 2 mandatory core biopsy ( 4 pass ) diagnosis obtain tissue biologic expression profile . Any subject clinically palpable residual disease may undergo optional third biopsy allow identification presume pathway resistance therapy . This information might useful provide subject option target therapy definitive surgery confirm residual disease . Definitive local therapy surgery radiation therapy indicate performed completion 12 week paclitaxelbased chemotherapy . Are able swallow retain oral medication ( intact pill ) .
