	<brief_title>Controlled Trial Test Efficacy Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements Prevent Severe Stunting Among Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Poor growth severe childhood stunt common rural Malawi elsewhere Sub-Sahara Africa . To date , intervention prove successful promote linear growth early childhood . Our preliminary result Malawi suggest year-long daily complementary feeding infant high-energy , micronutrient-fortified spread ( FS ) may markedly reduce incidence severe stunt age 18 month . In present study investigator carefully analyze efficacy linear growth promotion health benefit product provide complementary food infant 6 18 month age . The study conduct Lungwena area , Mangochi District , rural Malawi . Six-month old healthy infant identify community survey study area . 840 infant meeting set criterion randomize receive follow intervention 6 18 month age : 1 ) standard treatment ie extra food supplement ( dietary supplementation 18 30 month age ) ( ST-DI , control group ) , 2 ) , `` standard '' fortify spread milk-powder protein source ( FSm ) , 3 ) modify fortify spread soy-powder protein source ( FSs ) , 4 ) fortify maize-soy flour ( likuni phala , LP ) . The family receive food supplement 2-weekly interval participant undergo anthropometric developmental evaluation laboratory analyse 12-week interval . Outcome analyse do 18 36 month age . The impact dietary intervention primarily assess compare incidence severe stunt four study group . Secondary outcome include number anthropometric variable , morbidity , developmental milestone , laboratory parameter . The study also produce descriptive data possible mechanisms growth failure among trial subject .</detailed_description>
