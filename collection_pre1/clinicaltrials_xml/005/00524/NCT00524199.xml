	<brief_summary>The purpose research study examine effect drug call mesna removal homocysteine blood dialysis . Homocysteine amino acid ( protein building block ) find blood people , however considerably elevate dialysis patient . People increase level homocysteine blood increase risk develop plaque buildup artery relate problem heart attack stroke . This study determine mesna improve rate homocysteine removal blood dialysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Homocysteine thiol amino acid derive dietary methionine . Elevated plasma total homocysteine ( tHcy ) , term hyperhomocysteinemia , grade , independent risk factor development atherosclerosis . Elevated plasma tHcy normalize supplementation folic acid vitamin B6 B12 patient normal renal function treatment show halt progression atherosclerotic plaque . Over 90 % patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) require hemodialysis elevate plasma tHcy . The leading cause morbidity mortality patient cardiovascular-related pathology myocardial infarction stroke . Vitamin supplementation consistently fail normalize elevate plasma tHcy patient ESRD , thus leave increase risk . Plasma tHcy 70 - 80 % covalently protein bound limit effectiveness dialysis tHcy lower treatment . Mesna ( sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid ) thiol-containing drug currently indicate prevent hemorrhagic cystitis associate ifosfamide chemotherapy . Mesna incidentally show deplete plasma thiols cancer patient undergo ifosfamide chemotherapy . Mesna act exchange thiols bound plasma protein enhance renal excretion . In vitro study laboratory show mesna rapidly ( within 5 minute ) exchange protein bound homocysteine yield significantly large dialyzable fraction thiol amino acid . A pilot study recently complete group demonstrate significant decrease tHcy eight hemodialysis patient receive 12 mg/kg mesna three time week pre-dialysis one week . Although therapy cause significant decline tHcy , mesna fail reduce tHcy normal level . The cumulative effect mesna administration longer treatment period evaluate .</detailed_description>
