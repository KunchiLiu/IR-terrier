	<brief_title>An Exploratory Biomarker Study ARQ 501 Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ARQ 501 investigational anticancer agent consist fully synthetic small molecule version β-lapachone ( 3,4-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-2H-naphtho [ 1,2-b ] pyran-5,6-dione ) stable formulation intravenous ( IV ) administration . ARQ 501 selectively induces apoptosis cancer cell direct activation cellular checkpoint without damage deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) microtubules . This therapeutic approach know Activated Checkpoint Therapy ( ACT ) sm . ACTsm novel strategy treat prevent cancer . Cell cycle checkpoint constitute internal surveillance system detect cellular , especially genetic , damage either allow cell repair damage , induce apoptosis damage repairable . Cancer cell selectively eliminate upon checkpoint activation due presence irreparable DNA damage . It believe rapid selective induction apoptosis cancer cell ARQ 501 cause correspondingly rapid sustained increase pro-apoptotic protein E2F1 . Preclinical study show exposure ARQ 501 result activation inactivation panel 5 biomarkers . Time course change human tumor xenograft biomakers athymic mouse exposure ARQ 501 classify 3 biomarker group : change shortly exposure return normal within 24 hour ; change shortly exposure remain 24 hour longer ; change 24 hour later . The primary objective evaluate response biomarkers patient treat ARQ 501 . The exploratory study help illuminate pharmacodynamics biomarkers , role cancer growth control , potential predictive prognostic value disease treatment ARQ 501 human .</detailed_description>
