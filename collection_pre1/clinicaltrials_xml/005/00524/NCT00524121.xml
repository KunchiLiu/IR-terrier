	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving erlotinib together radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give erlotinib together radiation therapy work treat old patient stage I , stage II , stage III , stage IV esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess overall survival old patient stage I-IV squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma esophagus gastroesophageal junction treat erlotinib hydrochloride combination radiotherapy . Secondary - Assess proportion patient achieve mucosal complete response treatment regimen . - Determine progression-free survival patient treat regimen . - Assess effect regimen dysphagia control , performance status , overall quality life patient . - Investigate correlation smoking status overall survival patient . - To correlate Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) phosphor Epidermal growth factor receptor ( pEGFR ) expression IHC EGFR mutation status clinical outcome . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy 5 day week week 1-4 5 day week first 5.5 week . Tumor tissue sample analyze IHC expression E-cadherin , P-cadherin , vimentin , cytokeratin , phospho-S6 , Ki67 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
