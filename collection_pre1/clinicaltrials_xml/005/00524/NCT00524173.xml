	<brief_summary>This study test whether combination two medication , tenofovir emtricitabine , safer effective treating chronic hepatitis B tenofovir alone . Chronic hepatitis B liver disease cause infection hepatitis B virus . Several medication , include standard pegylated interferon anti-viral drug lamivudine , adefovir , entecavir telbivudine , currently use treat disease . Problems associate agent , however , include development viral resistance long-term therapy anti-virals . Since many patient require long-term therapy prevent disease worsening , major goal new approach treatment prevent development viral resistance . Combination treatment show effective strategy prevent resistance . Tenofovir anti-viral drug approve use patient HIV infection . In small study patient infected HIV hepatitis B , tenofovir lower level hepatitis B virus blood , viral resistance report used 5 year . Emtricitabine anti-viral drug similar lamivudine effective lower viral load improve liver damage . Patients 18 year age old chronic hepatitis B may eligible study . Participants admit NIH Clinical Center complete medical history examination , include blood urine test , chest X-ray , electrocardiogram , abdominal ultrasound , Fibroscan ( ultrasound exam liver measure amount scar ) , bone mineral density scan liver biopsy . They randomly assign take combination treatment tenofovir plus emtricitabine tenofovir alone least 48 week . During treatment period , patient visit Clinical Center blood test physical examination every 2 week first month every 4 12 week . After 48 week , patient readmitted Clinical Center complete evaluation include test do start therapy , include liver biopsy . Patients seem improve treatment may continue therapy 192 week , admit Clinical Center complete medical evaluation liver biopsy . Patients whose condition improve 48 week treatment treatment change stop continue regular outpatient clinic visit 24 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tenofovir Alone Versus Tenofovir With Emtricitabine Treat Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis B major cause cirrhosis , end-stage liver disease hepatocellular carcinoma affect approximately 1.25 million Americans . Six medication license use chronic hepatitis B United States , relative benefit long-term efficacy remain unclear . In previous study , show maintained suppression HBV DNA achieve nucleoside analogues suppression associate marked improvement disease . In randomized study , propose evaluate long-term therapy tenofovir alone combination emtricitabine ( FTC ) . Forty treatment-naive patient chronic hepatitis B enrol primary study . After medical evaluation liver biopsy , patient stratify hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) status randomize receive either tenofovir alone combination FTC . Treatment continue long-term ( least four year ) patient carefully monitor side effect , serum aminotransferase HBV DNA level . Patients undergo repeat liver biopsy assessment antiviral resistance 1 4 year . The primary endpoint therapy maintain suppression HBV DNA 10 ( 2 ) copies/ml ( low limit detection current assay ) . The study assess relative efficacy safety combination versus mono-therapy . A separate group 60 previously treat patient also enrol randomized mono- combination-therapy ass safety profile agent . The primary analysis conduct entire study cohort .</detailed_description>
