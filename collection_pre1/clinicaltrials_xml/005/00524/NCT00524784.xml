	<detailed_description>Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation ( HSCT ) revolutionize treatment hematopoietic malignancy , inherit hematopoietic disorder , aplastic anemia , severe disease . Unfortunately , graft versus host disease ( GvHD ) remain major toxicity greatly limit application efficacy allogeneic HSCT , occur commonly procedure affect 30 80 % patient . Acute GvHD occur within 100 day 50 % allogeneic HLA-matched HSCT recipients despite prophylactic immunosuppressive drug . The efficient treatment GvHD prevention T cell depletion . However , clinician avoid modality due crucial effect T cell prevention tumor relapse . Current standard prophylaxis therapy acute GvHD include mainly use immunosuppressive drug help less 50 % patient associate increased infection risk . New strategy GvHD prophylaxis examine study us physiological strategy antigen present cell ( APC ) tolerance induction modulate effector cell either directly via T regulatory cell . ApoCell treatment anticipate prophylactic measure acute GvHD induce tolerance donor effector cell , lead potentially significant decrease immune response donor cell recipient . The effect apoptotic cell prevent GvHD may involve follow mechanism : inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine production , promote anti-inflammatory cytokine production , induce tolarogenic APCs , decrease ability stimulate T-cell response , delete CD8 T-effector cell , induce regulatory T-cells , inhibit response inflammatory cytokine LPS . Tolarex Ltd. propose novel cell-based approach donor apoptotic cell treatment , ApoCell , Phase I-IIa study patient undergo sibling HSCT high risk develop acute GvHD . The ApoCell product compose HLA-matched donor mononuclear enrich leukocytes form liquid suspension inject intravenously patient 24 hour prior HSCT . The ApoCell suspension contain least 55 % early apoptotic cell . The cell suspension prepare cGMP condition PBS solution within 8 hour prior intravenous injection store 2-8oC administer .</detailed_description>
