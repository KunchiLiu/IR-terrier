	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sunitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Chemoembolization kill tumor cell block blood flow tumor keep chemotherapy drug , doxorubicin , near tumor . Giving sunitinib together chemoembolization may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give sunitinib together chemoembolization work treat patient liver cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine progression-free survival 4 month patient treat regimen . Secondary - To determine overall survival patient . - To determine dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) use measure decrease tumor perfusion vascular permeability result treatment sunitinib malate combination TACE , useful prognosis . - To examine safety tolerability regimen . - To determine change circulate endothelial precursor cell number total monocyte count day 3 , 8 , 10 , 35 therapy ( compare level baseline ) decrease soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 serum day 8 ( TACE ) , 10 , 35 therapy ( compare baseline ) correlate improve response survival . - To determine effect therapy quality life measure FACT-HEP scale prior course therapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily day 1-7 15-35 course 1 day 1-28 subsequent course . Patients undergo hepatic artery chemoembolization doxorubicin hydrochloride day 8 course 1 . Treatment sunitinib malate repeat every 6 weeks* absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Course 1 7 week duration ; subsequent course 6 week duration . Blood sample collect baseline periodically study measure circulate endothelial precursor cell level , total monocyte count , soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 . Quality life assess FACT-HEP scale baseline , prior course treatment , completion treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month .</detailed_description>
