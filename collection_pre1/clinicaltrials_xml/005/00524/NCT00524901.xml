	<brief_summary>This phase 2 study evaluates effect intravenous administration bolus EPO activation EPOR-signal transduction cascade myocardial apoptosis cardiopulmonary bypass surgery . Human atrial ventricular tissue collect CABG surgery 3-vessel disease assay EPOR signal apoptosis . Two atrial specimen collect end cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . Concomitantly , two transmural ventricular biopsy obtain , start end CPB . Immediately obtain first atrial biopsy , one bolus EPO administer intravenously . The atrial tissue split appropriate section frozen determination baseline expression activity number molecule include Erk1/2 , STAT5 , Akt caspase-3 embed paraffin immunohistochemistry . Ventricular tissue process immunohistochemistry . Additionally , plasma collect procedure 30 day post-procedure examine release marker myocardial ischemia stress ( CK-MB , Troponin T NT-proBNP ) renal dysfunction ( cystatin C , creatinine eGFR ) . Before initialize randomise study , pilot study perform 5 subject treat evaluate feasibility myocardial sample collection . Initiation randomise study commence baseline activity EPOR-STC determine atrial tissue caspase-3 positive cell identify second ventricular biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Before studyspecific procedure , include assessment screen , appropriate write informed consent must obtain . Man woman 18 80 year age . Undergoing plan , elective cardiopulmonary bypass operation first time 3vessel coronary artery disease anticipate aortic cross clamp time approximately 40 minute total bypass time approximately 90 minute . Hemoglobin ( Hb ) concentration ≥7.4 mmol/l ≤9.9 mmol/l within 7 day prior CABG surgery major acute blood loss since Hb determination . An unstable medical condition , define hospitalized noncardiac condition within 4 week screen , major surgery within 24 week screen , otherwise unstable judgment investigator ( e.g. , risk complication adverse event unrelated study participation ) . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 40 % . Clinical history chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) ( point prior registration ) define serum creatinine &gt; 105 μmol/l female , &gt; 130 μmol/l black male , &gt; 115 μmol/l nonblack male . Atrial fibrillation , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation atrial flutter . Clinically significant abnormality chemistry , hematology , urinalysis parameter perform within screen period . Current symptoms polyurea , polydipsia , increase thirst . Grand mal seizure within 1 year enrollment . Poorly control hypertension , define systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &gt; 180 mmHg diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) &gt; 105 mmHg day CABG surgery . Use erythropoietic protein ( e.g. , rHuEPO ; Procrit® , Eprex® , Neorecormon® , Epogen® , Aranesp® ) within 12 week enrolment . Positive pregnancy test know pregnant time screening . Recent ( within 3 month ) history alcohol illicit drug abuse disorder , base selfreport . Severe uncorrected valvular disease ( include pulmonary tricuspid ) leave ventricular outflow obstruction , opinion investigator , require surgery . Pulmonary hypertension , define pulmonary artery pressure &gt; 30 mmHg rest . Participation investigational device drug trial ( ) receive investigational agent ( ) within 30 day . Known positive HIV antibody , hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis C antibody . Any condition ( e.g. , unsuitable anatomy atrium ; psychiatric illness ; etc . ) situation , investigator 's opinion , could put subject significant risk , confound study result , interfere significantly subject 's participation study .</criteria>
