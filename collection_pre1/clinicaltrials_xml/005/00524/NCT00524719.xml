	<brief_summary>Distal radius fracture common fracture occur adult population , displace maintain joint congruity common subtype . Locking-plate technology represent true advance fixation fracture , especially view ever increase incidence injury age osteoporotic population throughout Europe North America . These plate permit rigid fixation , even osteopenic bone , avoid tether soft tissue , see external fixation percutaneous pinning . For reason , mode fracture fixation rapidly gain popularity . Unfortunately , presently little evidence support use traditional method fixation ( percutaneous pinning , external fixation ) . In addition , technique application invasive cost considerably great latter two technique . As , pertinent evaluate , scientifically sound fashion , outcome fixation three type implant include study . The result clinical trial allow orthopaedic community confidently recommend fixation method provide optimal functional , clinical , radiographic outcome patient suffer displaced distal radius preserve joint congruity . Null hypothesis : There difference functional , clinical , radiographic outcome three treatment method . Hypothesis : Given lock nature modern screw-plate construct , produce excellent fixation even osteopenic bone permit early range motion exercise ; give plate fixation , contrast external fixation percutaneous pinning , tether muscle , tendon , capsule ; plate fixation volar fixed-angle device permit earlier aggressive rehabilitation rapid complete regain hand wrist function compare stabilization external fixation percutaneous pinning .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Three Fixation Techniques Displaced Distal Radius Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fractures distal radius , common fracture occur adult , increase incidence cost due age population link senile osteoporosis . Young adult also suffer injury albeit involve higher-energy mechanism . Closed reduction casting often unsuccessful maintain adequate alignment length , crucial successful outcome . Thus , trend toward surgical treatment fracture . In fracture preserve joint congruity , 3 fixation option exist : percutaneous pinning ( Kapandji technique ) , non-spanning external fixation , locked-plates . Locked-plates represent significant advance fixation fracture , especially osteopenic bone , although role distal radius fracture yet define adequately . The Cochrane Group undertake meta-analysis RC trial `` determine , type , surgical intervention appropriate treatment fracture distal radius adult . '' The author conclude : `` need good quality evidence surgical management fracture . '' The aim randomize clinical trial compare functional , clinical , radiographic outcomes 3 method . The result clearly guide surgeon choice optimal technique . This multicenter prospective randomize trial involve Canadian Orthopaedic Trauma Society ( COTS ) , association trauma surgeon involve collaborative outcome research proven track record research publication . Patients displace distal radius fracture joint congruity meet eligibility criterion provide consent participate randomly assign reduction fixation one three method : volar locked-plate , percutaneous pin cast ( Kapandji intra-focal technique ) , non-spanning external fixation . Patients undergo physiotherapy accord protocol adapt fixation technique . Evaluation fixed interval include functional , clinical , radiological parameter . Functional evaluation include PRWE , DASH , SMFA questionnaires . Clinical outcome evaluate range motion , pinch grip strength , dexterity . Standard radiographic parameter measure . The primary outcome measure functional outcome measure PRWE . Appropriate statistical analysis perform data . Sample size calculation reveals need 108 patient per treatment arm . A census center commit study predicts 12-18 month recruitment period . Patient follow-up end 2 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient 1 . Over 18 year age skeletal maturity , consent participate . 2 . A displaced distal metaphyseal radius fracture ( AO type A2 , A3 , C1 , C2 appendix 1 ) congruous joint surface ( &lt; 2 mm displacement ) either closed reduction . 3 . 21 day less injury surgery . 4 . The patient must medically fit anaesthesia . 5 . The patient must mental faculty participate post operative evaluation . Patient exclusion criterion : 1 . Significant bone disorder ( osteomalacia , hyperparathyroidism ) may impair bone healing ( include osteoporosis ) . 2 . Open fracture . 3 . Neurovascular injury require repair limb . 4 . Ipsilateral limb injury . 5 . Active infection area surgical approach . 6 . Prior wrist injury degenerative condition , congenital wrist anomaly . Fracture inclusion criterion : Patients sustain displaced AO type A2 A3 C1 C2 distal metaphyseal radius fracture preserve joint congruity ( 52 ) close reduction eligible inclusion . Radiographic criterion unacceptable close reduction include : 1 . Palmar tilt &lt; 00 . 2 . Radial inclination &lt; 150 . 3 . Radial shorten &gt; 5 mm . 4 . Articular step gap &gt; or= 2 mm . Fracture exclusion criterion : 1 . Fractures apex dorsal angulation ( `` Smith fracture '' ) exclude amenable treatment three method . 2 . Less 1 cm intact volar cortex distal fragment minimum necessary nonspanning external fixation ( 40 , 48 ) .</criteria>
