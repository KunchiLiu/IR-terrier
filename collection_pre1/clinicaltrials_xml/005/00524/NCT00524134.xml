	<brief_summary>In 1 3 patient epilepsy , seizure continue occur despite use one antiepileptic medication . Patients also significant problem side-effects medication dos increase . Our body naturally generate miniature pump locate surface many organ get rid toxic substance , antiepileptic medication consider cell body toxin . Research epileptic brain region show increase amount drug pump , therefore get rid antiepileptic drug . One pump call p-glycoprotein ( P-gp short ) . Medications may unable penetrate stay within part brain need . This may mean amount drug actually low part brain cause seizure , high rest brain , may patient may still feel side-effects seizure still occur . Research animals show block P-gp pump improve bad , many seizure occur well length seizure . Blockage pump do use different type medication . Some medication use common problem discover also block P-gp pump . One , carvedilol , use treat heart failure high blood pressure . It find safe patient , lot side-effects . We plan add medication addition patient 's anti-seizure medication see improve epileptic seizure . The reason patient high amount P-gp pump others may relate genetics . A simple blood test use determine person 's potential produce high quantity pump . This study also attempt show genetics affect well P-gp block work .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Center Disease Control report epilepsy afflict 2.7 million Americans annual cost $ 15.5 billion . They estimate 3 % Americans diagnosis epilepsy age 80 , decide 1997 focus treatment , motto `` seizure , side effect '' . Antiepileptic drug ( AED ) fail , despite structurally unrelated act different part nervous system . This refractory state constitute 35 % epilepsy population , may due pharmacoresistance . Efflux transporter , P-glycoprotein ( Pgp ) , present bloodbrain barrier serve pump structurally unrelated compound , likely serve method removal toxin ( drug ) . Upregulation efflux transporter Pgp tumor cell think contribute chemotherapy resistant cancer tumor , Pgp also find focally seizure focus . Its overexpression also note blood vessel endothelial cell follow temporal lobe resection intractable epilepsy . Case series show mRNA MDR1 , gene encode Pgp , 10x great medial temporal lobe patient temporal lobe epilepsy , compare without epilepsy . Pathological examination follow surgical resection find epilepsy cause lesion cortical dysplasia , encephalitis , tuberculous leptomeningitis , tuberous sclerosis astrocytomas express Pgp neuron and/or glia , whereas normal brain parenchyma . In animal cell research , upregulation see follow seizure induction status epilepticus . Many AEDs validate substrate Pgp animal study . Delivery medication brain likely associate Pgp case , presence substrate may upregulate Pgp . When Pgp inhibitor add animal model drug resistant epilepsy , significant improvement seizure frequency , duration severity , provide proof-of-concept animal level . Carvedilol verapamil , among medication , find potent Pgp inhibitor . Verapamil dexverapamil , either oral intravenous , use Pgp-inhibitors clinical trial , success adjuvant malignant lymphoma phase III study adjunct chemorefractory , metastatic breast carcinoma . There clinical trial publish use Pgp-inhibition epilepsy .</detailed_description>
