	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Calcitriol may help prostate cancer cell become like normal cell , grow spread slowly . Dexamethasone may help calcitriol work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . Giving calcitriol together dexamethasone may effective treatment prostate cancer respond hormone therapy . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give calcitriol together dexamethasone work treat patient prostate cancer respond hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Calcitriol Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To investigate response rate patient androgen-independent prostate cancer treat calcitriol dexamethasone . - To evaluate toxicity high-dose calcitriol dexamethasone patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral dexamethasone day 1 2 calcitriol IV 1 hour day 2 . Treatment repeat weekly absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline day 2 3 ass VDR CYP24 expression peripheral blood mononuclear cell .</detailed_description>
