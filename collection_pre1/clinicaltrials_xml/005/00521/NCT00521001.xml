	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor block enzyme need cell growth . Giving everolimus together temozolomide may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give everolimus together temozolomide work treat patient stage IV melanoma remove surgery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide Everolimus Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma That Can Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Estimate 9-week progression-free survival rate patient stage IV malignant melanoma treat everolimus temozolomide . Secondary - Evaluate overall survival time . - Evaluate time disease progression . - Evaluate confirm response rate . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral everolimus day day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 , 29-33 oral temozolomide day day 8-12 course 1 . For course 2 subsequent course , patient receive oral everolimus day day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 oral temozolomide day day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . All patient undergo blood sample collection periodically correlative study . Samples analyze relative number T , B , NK cell via flow cytometry , quantitative immunoglobulin level ( IgG , IgM , IgA ) , Tetramer/ELISPOT CTL frequency CMV/EBV immunodominant antigen , V beta T cell spectratyping , VEGF level via ELISA . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 8 week .</detailed_description>
