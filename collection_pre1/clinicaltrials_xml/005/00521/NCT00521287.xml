	<brief_summary>According survey Department Health 2004 , cancer lead cause death Taiwan area . In 2004 , people die cancer , account 27.2 percent death . The major reason superior grade cancer ability escape surveillance immune system . It also main issue address medical research . Dendritic cell ( DCs ) , potent APC , locate site pathogen entry , acquire antigen pathogens pathogen-infected cell , process antigen class I class II presentation . Upon antigen encounter , term immature DCs , undergo maturation process , capable present capture antigen T cell . This maturation step allow DC migration trigger adaptive immune response . These feature make DCs good candidate therapy various pathological condition include malignancy . Therefore , two concept project concern : one enhancement T cell immunity improvement efficiency DC-tumor fusion . The strategy enhance T cell use well-known cytokine , IL2 , IL7 expand tumor-specific CD4 CD8 T cell DC-vaccine treatment . In past , scientist utilize polyethyleneglycol fuse cancer cell dendritic cell . However , result devastate . Two new approach DC vaccine apply study : DC-tumor fusion DC phagocytosed apoptosed tumor cell . Whole tumor cell fuse DCs combine hypotonic buffer electrical-based fusion protocol . The safety hybrid cell vaccination show clinical trial encourage anti-tumour effect . However , data yet insufficient ass clear therapeutic benefit . Hopefully , combination two strategy improve efficiency DC vaccine boost survival cancer patient . As gained clearer understand cellular molecular event modulate antigen presentation T cell activation vivo , new strategy emerge , allow development potent second generation DC vaccine .</brief_summary>
