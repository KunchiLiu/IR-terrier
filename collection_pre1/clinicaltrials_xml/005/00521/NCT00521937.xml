	<brief_summary>It estimate 300 million people worldwide diabetes year 2025 . About 12 percent diabetes foot ulcer , major source morbidity , concern , cost . The foot ulcer lead cause hospitalization among people diabetes often lead amputation . The cost treatment high morbidity mortality associate diabetic foot problem necessitate need systemic approach foot ulcer management . Current local treatment type ulcer : dressing ( hydrocolloid , alginate… ) , growth factor . However modern dressing may avoid infection result clinical study significant term complete heal rate term time heal . Concerning growth factor , one whose therapeutic application make proof rhPDGF ( Regranex® ) increase number ulcer completely heal twentieth week compare placebo ( 50 % 35 % , respectively ) . The advancement tissue-engineering make possible dermal replacement human wound facilitate healing . A new sponge compose collagen glycosaminoglycans ( chondroitins 4 6 sulphate ) , reticulate ionic bond chitosan freeze-drying , developed France . This sponge non-toxic product due non-chemical reticulation ( ionic bond ) , biocompatible biodegradable process , handle storable easily . The objective study demonstrate substitute , cellularized functional allogenic fibroblast , comply safety condition , enables lead heal diabetic foot ulcer .</brief_summary>
