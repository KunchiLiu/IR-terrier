	<detailed_description>The primary goal study effect treatment duration , compare potential change psychodynamic group psychotherapy vary length ( 20 80 session ) , measure symptomatic distress , interpersonal problem , psychosocial functioning , dynamic personality structure . Hypotheses related primary goal : Patients short- long-term therapy symptomatically ( SCL-90-R ; Derogatis , 1977 ) improve equal degree , patient long-term group psychotherapy large improvement interpersonal problem ( IIP-64 ; Alden et al , 1990 ) , psychosocial functioning , dynamic personality structure . A secondary goal investigate predictive value select patient variable ( moderator ) : • Personality pathology : Internal object relationship ( QOR ; Høglend et al , 2003 ) : Patients well object relationship improve short- long-term therapy , patient poorer object relationship improve long-term therapy less short-term therapy . Personality disorder : Patients without personality disorder improve equally well short- long-term group psychotherapy , patient personality disorder substantial reduction criterion personality disorder long-term group psychotherapy . • Severity initial disturbance : Patients high severity initial disturbance well long-term short-term therapy . Patients low severity initial disturbance equally well short- long-term group psychotherapy . • Education : Years formal education ( expression positive mental capacity ) include potential important moderator base instructional organizational research . A tertiary goal study mediator , mechanism change : Attributional Style Questionnaire ( Seligman et al. , 1979 ) , Self-understanding ( Mary Beth Conolly Gibbons , 2004 ) , Therapist Introject ( Arnold , Farber , &amp; Geller , 2004 ) primary mediator . The Therapist Introject modify 'Group Introject ' measure , since experience group psychotherapy show patient often internalize part the-group-as-a-whole successful therapy . A fourth goal study impact different process variable . Studies short-term therapy , indicate development early strong therapeutic alliance relate positive therapy process outcome . This may different long-term therapy , work character defenses mid-phase therapy , may lead variation alliance . However , hardly study . A study short-term group psychotherapy indicate positive relation cohesion outcome , lack similar study long-term therapy . The Group climate Questionnaire ( GCQ ) contain three subscales ( engagement , avoidance conflict ) , tap degree engagement psychological work , reluctance take responsibility psychological change , friction member , respectively . It use study group development , stage , outcome , mostly short-term group . Again , lack study long-term group . We want compare potentially differential development influence dimension short- long-term group psychotherapy . Material Methods This randomize clinical study fulfil follow criterion : Patients clinical situation Representative sample Estimation statistical power clinical significance Control treatment integrity ( analyze audio recording ) Experienced therapist Treatment protocol Control therapist effect Four evaluation More one rater time point Specified primary result variable Evaluators blind treatment type Patients blind hypothesis test Analysis drop out Intention treat analysis Moderators specify priori Patients : Inclusion criterion : Patients consult referred oupatient psychiatric center private pratice , consider suitable ambulant psychodynamic group psychotherapy . Exclusion criterion : Active psychotic disorder , drug alcohol dependence main diagnosis , organically base symptom , e.g . brain damage , autism adult ADHD . Sample size , calculation statistical power : We want detect moderate difference effect-size long-term short-term group psychotherapy , i.e . =.50 , measure Global Assessment Functioning ( GAF : American Psychiatric Association , 1987 ) . In effectiveness study ( Lorentzen et al. , 2002 ) find post-therapy GAF standard deviation 5.9 . We consider 3.0 GAF-points see least improvement clinically significant , i.e . = .50 , treatment . We read directly nomogram ( Altman , 1991 ) need sample size n = 120 order power .80 significance level .05 ( two-tailed ) . This mean need 60 patient group . Patient selection : The patient recruit four ( geographical ) center , consist one coordinator 2-3 therapist . The coordinator evaluate diagnose patient randomize two different treatment condition . After randomization , patient ' expectation therapy note . The group close , attrition long-term group large , new patient admit . They include study enter group first 6 month . Therapists , group : Each therapist take one short- one long-term group , order eliminate `` therapist noise '' ) . Therapies : Patients receive two different form psychodynamic group psychotherapy . We develop manual two therapy format , therapist train therapy form . They include description framework psychodynamic understanding intervention , well principle differentiate two format : e.g . degree focus , therapist activity , handle termination therapy . Several session ( early , midway end ) record rat order check treatment integrity . Evaluation : The patient interview treatment , three year therapy start . The interviews audio-recorded include full psychiatric record , diagnosis ( SCID I og II ; Spitzer et al , 1988 ) psychodynamic/structural aspect . The evaluator blind therapy patient . Self-rated outcome measure fill every three month treatment . Statistics : Pre-post-follow-up change potential difference two group treat differently , examine use mixed linear modelling analysis . Clinically significant change single patient calculate normative value population RCI ( reliable change index ; Jacobson , &amp; Truax , 1991 ) . The predictive power different patient variable within treatment , analyse multiple regression analysis . Scientific board We organize scientific board consist Prof. dr. med . Per Høglend , Associate Prof. dr. med . Steinar Lorentzen , University Oslo , Research director dr. med . Torleif Ruud , SINTEF ; Professor , PhD Michael J. Lambert , Brigham Young University , Utah . Steinar Lorentzen lead research responsible carry project . We one research fellow , Jan Vegard Bakali , would like one connect project . Several raters hire later evaluate audio recording therapy evaluation session . Progression We establish four study site around Norway ( Ålesund , Stavanger , Sandnes Oslo ) train coordinator therapist spring/summer 2005 . The project license Data Inspectorate present Regional ethical committee medical research , objection project . Inclusion patient start August 2005 sixteen group start April 2007 . All patient include within end May 2007 . All patient end therapy end May 2009 assess follow-up summer 2010 . The publication process take place 2010-2011 , result part study may publish early . Scientific significance The study potentially contribute increase knowledge efficacy short- long-term dynamic group psychotherapy , impact treatment duration ( see attach recommendation Professor Michael J. Lambert , Brigham Young University ) . We also able find indication short- long-term group psychotherapy , depend patient characteristic predict outcome two therapy form . It difficult treat patient personality disorder short-term therapy , long-term psychotherapy show promising result . This study give important information significance treatment length ( interaction patient characteristic x treatment length ) .</detailed_description>
