	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety efficacy TRU-015 treatment B-cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL ) . TRU-015 also currently evaluate multiple clinical study treatment autoimmune disorder . Over 300 patient receive TRU-015 study , data observe date support safety patient autoimmune disorder . Safety escalate dose 4 weekly infusion TRU-015 evaluate subject relapse NHL ( see inclusion criterion subtypes ) . Once maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) confirm maximum dose study determined safe well tolerate , expand cohort subject relapse follicular NHL evaluate efficacy .</brief_summary>

Small lymphocytic lymphoma include primary diagnosis lymphoma cell &lt; 5.0 x 109/L ( 5000/mm3 ) peripheral blood . *Subjects enrol preliminary efficacy cohort must relapse , refractory , persistent follicular lymphoma ( persistent disease define compute tomography ( CT ) positive 3 month last treatment ) , must receive antiCD20 target therapy within 3 month receive first dose test article . Subjects may consider eligible single therapy probable clinical benefit , standard effective treatment available opinion investigator . Prior CD20 immunophenotyping tumor document B cell NHL acceptable . If prior documentation available , immunophenotype current disease must document fineneedle aspirate biopsy , circulate CD20positive NHL cell peripheral blood administration test article .
