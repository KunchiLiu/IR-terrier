	<brief_summary>This Phase 3 , randomize , open-label , multicenter study rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patient low disease activity ( Disease Activity Score 28 [ DAS28 ] &gt; 2.8 &lt; 3.5 ) conduct evaluate induction remission add infliximab pre-existing treatment versus additional treatment . All subject eligible study , age &gt; 35 &lt; =65 year , diagnosis RA accord American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) criterion , offer additional treatment infliximab . Prior start treatment , subject must stable regimen disease modify antirheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) least 3 month . Subjects randomize ( 1:1 ) basic therapy without infliximab total duration 38 week follow follow-up period 6 month . Subjects randomize basic therapy + infliximab receive infliximab 3 mg/kg Weeks 0 , 2 , 6 , 14 , 22 , 30 , 38 . The primary objective study ass rate remission accord DAS 28 ( &lt; 2.6 ) end treatment ( 38 week ) . Safety assessment include incidence adverse event , serious adverse event , clinically notable abnormal vital sign laboratory value .</brief_summary>
