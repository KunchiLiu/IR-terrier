	<brief_summary>Andersen-Tawil Syndrome ( ATS ) rare , genetic disorder cause episodes muscle weakness , potentially life-threatening change heart rhythm , developmental abnormality . Disease symptoms vary , cause ATS case remain unknown , specific treatment identify . The purpose multi-site study well characterize ATS , establish whether symptom change time , determine symptom related mutation KCNJ2 gene .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ATS ion channel disorder cause episodes muscle weakness potentially life-threatening heart arrhythmia treatment identify . The majority ATS case cause mutation KCNJ2 gene ; case result unknown cause . The KCNJ2 gene mutation alters potassium channel way disrupts flow potassium ion skeletal heart muscle . This lead characteristic periodic paralysis irregular heart rhythm . The purpose study well define genetic basis , clinical feature , disease progression ATS . The study also establish clinically relevant endpoint use future clinical study . This observational study last 2 year involve three study visit . The first visit entail 1.5- 3.5-day inpatient stay ; length stay depend whether participant take medication symptom weakness . Participants ask discontinue use medication inpatient stay . Participants ask stop medication may take heart symptom . This first study visit include medical history , quality life questionnaire , physical exam , muscle strength test . Nerve , muscle , heart activity also measure , blood drawn laboratory test optional DNA analysis . The second third study visit take place 1 2 year initial study visit include evaluation . During 8 week follow study visit , participant record telephone diary muscle heart symptoms experience . During 1 week yearly visit , participant also undergo outpatient heart rhythm evaluation . A study coordinator contact participant month phone course study review symptom .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinically confirm diagnosis ATS define least two follow three criterion : 1 . Presence clearcut episodes transient muscle weakness without fix deficit , typically follow exertion prolong rest OR atypical history otherwise typical exam finding ( absent reflex normal sensation episode ) OR unexplained hypokalemia episode OR abnormal longexercise nerve conduction study 2 . Heart conduction defect : prolong QTc interval 12lead electrocardiogram OR ventricular ectopy , include uniform multifocal PVCs , polymorphic VT , bidirectional VT 3 . Presence two follow physical feature : low set ear , hypertelorism , small mandible , clinodactyly , syndactyly , micromelia hand foot OR Meets one three criterion least one family member two criterion OR Does meet three criterion , posse mutation KCNJ2 gene Less 10 year age</criteria>
