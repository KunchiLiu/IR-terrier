	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose obatoclax mesylate give together topotecan hydrochloride see well work treat patient relapse refractory small cell lung cancer advance solid tumor . Obatoclax mesylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , topotecan hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving obatoclax mesylate together topotecan hydrochloride may help kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Obatoclax Mesylate Topotecan Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose , recommend phase II dose , toxicity profile obatoclax mesylate administer topotecan hydrochloride patient advance solid tumor . ( Phase I ) II . Determine response rate patient relapse refractory small cell lung cancer treat obatoclax mesylate topotecan hydrochloride . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate expression pro- anti-apoptotic protein may correlate obatoclax mesylate sensitivity resistance . OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation study obatoclax mesylate follow phase II study . PHASE I ( solid tumor ) : Patients receive obatoclax mesylate IV 3 hour day 1 OR day 1 3 topotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II ( small cell lung cancer ) : Patients receive obatoclax mesylate topotecan hydrochloride recommend phase II dose ( RPTD ) determine phase I . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tumor tissue sample patient small cell lung cancer may collect baseline correlative study . Tissue sample analyze biomarkers protein expression Bcl-2 , Bcl-Xl , MCL-1 , Bax , Bad , c-Myc , L-Myc , N-Myc immunohistochemistry . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
