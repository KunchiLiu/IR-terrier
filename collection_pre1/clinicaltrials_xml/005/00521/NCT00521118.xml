	<brief_title>Second Curettage Treating Patients With Persistent Non-Metastatic Gestational Trophoblastic Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine response second curettage patient persistent , non-metastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia ( GTN ) . Secondary - To evaluate response second curettage independent tumor burden measure quantitative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) assay study entry . - To evaluate response second curettage independent depth myometrial invasion measure sonographically follow initial curettage prior study entry ( persistent disease first diagnose ) . - To estimate frequency complication related second curettage , specifically infection fallopian tube ovary , hemorrhage associate curettage , operative injury uterus . - To estimate frequency change uterine histology first second curettage . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo second curettage rather standard treatment ( immediate chemotherapy ) . Patients whose disease transform choriocarcinoma , placental site trophoblastic tumor , epithelioid trophoblastic tumor ( histologically diagnose second curettage ) remove study . All patient undergo weekly beta-human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) test begin 14 day second curettage continue beta-hCG level normal . Patients undergo beta-HCG test weekly 4 week monthly 5 month . If level regress normal , rise , metastatic disease identify , patient remove study .</detailed_description>
