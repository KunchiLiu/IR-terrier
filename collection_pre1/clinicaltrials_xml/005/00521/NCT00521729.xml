	<brief_summary>This study examine body metabolism adjust small change environmental temperature may relate weight loss . Healthy , non-obese individual 18 60 year age may eligible study . The study consist one screen visit one 5-day admission NIH Clinical Center follow procedure : Diet : Participants follow proscribe diet consist 50 % carbohydrate , 20 % protein 30 % fat . DEXA scan measure body fat . Subjects lie table source X-rays small dose X-rays pass body . Air displacement plethysmography ( Bod-Pod ) study fat composition : Subjects sit small booth 10 minute wear swim suit breathe normally tube . This test measure person weight volume precisely . Metabolic room : Subjects stay 12 hour specialized room design measure amount oxygen breathe amount carbon dioxide breathe . The room contain private toilet sink , treadmill , bed , desk , window , telephone computer television internet access . While room , subject undergo following : - Continuous heart rate monitor : Subjects wear EKG monitor analyze heart rate variability . - Spontaneous movement : Subjects wear portable accelerometer hip wrist measure spontaneous physical movement . - Continuous temperature monitor : Subjects swallow small capsule transmits internal body temperature via miniature , wireless sensor . Adhesive patch place skin monitor external body temperature . - Blood urine collection : Subjects collect urine 12 hour metabolic room . Blood sample take specified interval catheter place vein . - Microdialysis : A small needle place fat tissue skin abdomen . A solution contain minimal amount ethanol infuse sample fluid collect every 20 minute leave fat pad . This help determine metabolism level . This procedure start 30 minute enter metabolic room continue subject leaf room . Fat tissue biopsy : A small piece fat tissue withdrawn needle skin abdomen . The sample use study fat tissue size ability store sugar .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolism Thyroid Hormone Changes During Exposure Cold Temperatures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thyroid hormone play important role modulation energy metabolism regulate rate thermogenesis , i.e . amount heat produce maintain stable core temperature organism . Clinically , hypo- hyperthyroidism associate major change thermoregulation energy expenditure . While rodent ability thyroid hormone regulate temperature energy expenditure response change temperature well know , actual role human poorly understood . We hypothesize human respond exposure moderate cold increase energy expenditure mediate thyroid hormone action , time , decrease heat dispersion . This randomized , cross-over study aim analyze change thyroid hormone , energy expenditure stress hormone response exposure mild change environmental temperature . A total 230 lean overweight volunteer 18 year age old , follow two-day period standardize diet , randomize either normal ( 75 ( Infinite ) F/24 ( Infinite ) C ) low-temperature ( 64 ( Infinite ) F/18 ( Infinite ) C ) 12- 24-hour stay temperature-controlled metabolic chamber . A standard meal provide six hour record study perform daytime . After two-day resting period test repeat second temperature . In order visualize quantify metabolic activity brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) , twenty five lean study volunteer younger 60 ask undergo 18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose PET-scan two 12-hour overnight stay metabolic chamber . In order determine impact mitochondrial function cold-stimulated BAT activity , sub-group volunteer carry mutation mitochondrial gene , succinate dehydrogenases , age- gender-matched control subject , undergo PET/CT scan end 24-hour stay metabolic chamber 18 ( Infinite ) C 24 ( Infinite ) C. The following parameter record analyze : Changes skin core temperature , heart rate variability , energy expenditure , change circulate thyroid hormone , ACTH , cortisol , catecholamine . Changes glucose uptake relation change energy expenditure measure PET-scan . The adipose tissue metabolism analyze microdialysis study volunteer ask undergo subcutaneous adipose tissue needle biopsy . The data gather study provide comprehensive insight mechanism ( ) regulate energy metabolism response mild cold . The result obtain proposed experiment might lead characterization population subject require excessive energy expenditure prevent hypothermia upon cold exposure . Thus , hypothesize subset subject exposure mild cold produce negative energy balance ultimately facilitating weight loss .</detailed_description>
