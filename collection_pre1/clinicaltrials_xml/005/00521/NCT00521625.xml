	<brief_summary>PALIVE 1 observational multicenter study mechanical ventilation strategy use child acute lung injury ( ALI ) . The objective study describe mechanical ventilation strategy child ALI . Our hypothesis daily clinical practice heterogenous among pediatric intensivists pediatric data exists optimal mechanical ventilation strategy group patient . Furthermore , different strategy may affect patient outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Few pediatric data exists ventilation mode parameter would provide great benefit least risk individual pediatric patient Acute Lung Injury ( ALI ) . Current expert opinion reasonable follow adult recommendation adapt clinical management child accord adult data . In absence consensus establish guideline mechanical ventilation child ALI , believe daily clinical practice pediatric intensive care unit subject great variation accord experience , comfort knowledge attend intensivist . METHODS Objective : Describe invasive non-invasive mechanical ventilation pediatric case ALI . Hypothesis : There important variability observe practice pattern mechanical ventilation pediatric case ALI . Design : An international cross-sectional epidemiologic study Pediatric Intensive Care Units observe practice pattern invasive non-invasive mechanical ventilation child ALI . Setting : Pediatric Intensive Care Units Canada , United States , Europe . Patients : Patients le 18 year old invasive non-invasive mechanical ventilation diagnosis ALI day study . Measurements : Demographic data include patient ; underlie chronic disease acute disease lead non-invasive mechanical ventilation intubation mechanical ventilation ; data mechanical ventilation mode parameter , vital sign , lab result , radiographic finding , treatment , complication mechanical ventilation record every 6 hour 24 hour . A web base case report form develop . Sample size : We plan conduct study isolated day least one month apart reach 200 patient ALI , include least 10 patient high frequency ventilation . We estimate 5 day study 70 center reach number . FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS We believe study provide important data actual mechanical ventilation strategy pediatric patient ALI . The next step conduct prospective international study mechanical ventilation strategy follow patient prospectively whole course mechanical ventilation .</detailed_description>
