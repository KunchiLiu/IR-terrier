	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Efficacy Using Seraffix LTB - ( Laser Tissue Bonding ) System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dermatologic wound close variety method . The choice particular closure technique base patient , wound , tissue characteristic , anatomic location . The purpose closure method approximation wound lip regenerate tissue reach phase , close sustain daily tensile force . Several method use wound closure suture , staple , tape , tissue adhesive laser energy . There two fundamental approach laser assist bond tissue : 1 . Laser welding-heating approximate edge cut tissue laser beam ; 2 . Laser soldering- apply biological solder onto approximate edge heat solder ( underlying tissue ) . Seraffix develop Seraffix LTB ( Laser Tissue Bonding ) System - laser system soft tissue bonding . This innovative system include feature make laser solder suitable clinical use . The Seraffix system compose CO2 laser device , propriety grip device ( Clamps ) solder agent ( Human Albumin ) .</detailed_description>
