	<brief_summary>The primary objective study investigate effectiveness intralesional ( IL ) PV-10 locoregional treatment metastatic melanoma . This study also include assessment response untreated bystander lesion follow intralesional injection PV-10 target lesion . Additional objectives determine safety profile PV-10 follow intralesional injection , assess pharmacokinetic profile PV-10 bloodstream follow intralesional injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open-label , single-agent study . Subjects least one melanoma lesion ≥ 0.2 cm diameter accurately measure ruler/caliper ultrasound receive intralesional injection PV-10 twenty ( 20 ) Study Lesions . Additionally , one two measurable Bystander Lesions may remain untreated followed assessment bystander response . To accurately reflect anticipated clinical use , repeat dose treated lesion allow Investigator 's discretion week 8 , 12 16 follow initial treatment lesion exhibit complete response .
