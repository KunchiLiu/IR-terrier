	<brief_title>EMPOWER Clinical Trial : Vagal Blocking Obesity Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Maestro System neuromodulation system consist implantable external component . Implantable component : two lead ( one electrode anterior posterior intra-abdominal vagal nerve trunk ) connect implantable neuroregulator . External component : one programmable , battery-powered , ambulatory external controller connect via small , flexible cable cutaneous transmit coil position externally neuroregulator . A clinician programmer transmits information controller upload data controller . All non-diabetic subject randomize 2:1 allocation therapy ON therapy OFF group . All type 2 diabetes mellitus subject randomize 1:1 allocation therapy ON therapy OFF group . All subject receive blind therapy 12-month follow-up visit . All subject participate medical weight management program .</detailed_description>
