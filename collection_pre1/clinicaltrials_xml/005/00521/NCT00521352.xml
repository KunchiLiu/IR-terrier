	<brief_summary>This study evaluate efficacy 1-Hz rTMS apply right Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex ( DLPFC ) patient Panic Disorder ( PD ) comorbid Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) fully respond conventional therapy . The investigator hypothesize : 1. compare sham ( placebo ) , active rTMS improve symptom PD MDD assess Panic Disorder Severity Scale ( PDSS ) , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) , Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) ; 2. active ( sham ) rTMS normalize level motor cortex excitability relative pre-treatment baseline .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study test efficacy repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) treatment Panic Disorder ( PD ) comorbid Major Depression ( MDD ) . Despite major advance treatment PD , standard therapeutic intervention effective patient , common reason treatment failure PD side effect major depression comorbidity . rTMS non-invasive procedure allow stimulation brain use magnetic field . Some study report rTMS may helpful reduce panic depressive symptom . While promising , prior research several limitation ( e.g. , relatively small sample size , relatively short duration treatment , lack sham ( placebo ) comparison ) . This study address drawback prior work , provide data important determine whether rTMS useful PD patient comorbid MDD resistant conventional therapy . In trial , 20 adult outpatient PD comorbid MDD , partially responsive conventional therapy , randomly assign one two treatment group ( active low frequency ( 1 Hz ) rTMS sham-placebo ) apply right Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex ( DLPFC ) daily four week . If rTMS add onto ongoing pharmacotherapy , dose must stable 1 month prior study entry . The right DLPFC select one among several brain region implicate PD , functional abnormality DLPFC also consistently replicate MDD . Pilot work indicate stimulation right DLPFC low frequency rTMS beneficial patient PD MDD . Low frequency rTMS add benefit well safety profile ( i.e . low risk seizure ) compare high frequency rTMS . Rating scale symptom change obtain baseline , rTMS course , end 4 week treatment . Patients meet response criterion four week sham offer open-label cross-over phase additional four week daily active rTMS treatment partial responder either active sham offer open-label cross-over phase additional four week daily active rTMS treatment . Patients meet response criterion either randomized phase cross-over phase continue routine clinical care supervision treat psychiatrist , invite back repeat assessment 1 , 3 6 month determine persistence benefit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients primary diagnosis Panic Disorder Major Depressive Disorder , confirm Structured Clinical Interview DSMIVTR ( SCID ) Residual panic attack MDD symptom , define total PDSS score ≥ 20 HDRS17 score ≥18 , despite treatment adequate trial serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SRI ) A duration index episode least month include . An adequate SRI trial define treatment least 68 week SRI , meet maximum recommended dosage level PD MDD ( fluoxetine 4060 mg/d , sertraline 100200 mg/d , paroxetine 4060 mg/d , fluvoxamine 200300 mg/d , citalopram 4060 mg/d , escitalopram 2030 mg/d ) . Individuals tolerate medication class dose specify duration described also include . Patients currently medication must stable dose ( ) one month prior enrollment willing continue dose ( ) duration study . Individuals diagnose bipolar disorder ( lifetime ) , psychotic disorder ( lifetime ) , Axis II personality disorder A history substance abuse dependence within past year ( except nicotine caffeine ) Significant acute suicide risk exclude . Other exclusion criterion include common every TMS protocol : Individuals clinically define neurological disorder , increase risk seizure reason , history treatment TMS , deep brain stimulation disorder exclude . Patients cardiac pacemaker , implanted medication pump , intracardiac line , acute , unstable cardiac disease , intracranial implant ( e.g . aneurysm clip , shunt , stimulators , cochlear implant , electrode ) metal object within near head , exclude mouth , safely remove exclude . Current use investigational drug , medication proconvulsive action , bupropion , maprotiline , tricyclic antidepressant , clomipramine , classical antipsychotic , daily use medication know inhibitory effect cortical excitability measure ( e.g. , anticonvulsant , stand dos benzodiazepine , sedative/hypnotics , atypical antipsychotic ) permit . If participate psychotherapy , patient must stable treatment least three month prior entry study , anticipation change frequency therapeutic session , therapeutic focus duration TMS trial . Finally , current significant laboratory abnormality , know suspected pregnancy , woman breastfeed woman childbearing potential use medically accept form contraception engage sexual intercourse also exclude .</criteria>
