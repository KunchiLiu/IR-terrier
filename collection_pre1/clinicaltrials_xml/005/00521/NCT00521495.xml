	<brief_summary>The purpose Phase II study ass feasibility conduct large scale trial evaluate effectiveness static magnetic field therapy treatment Carpal Tunnel Syndrome . This preliminary study determine three strength magnet use future . Participants recruit three primary source . 1 ) Patients possible diagnosis Carpal Tunnel Syndrome refer Orthopaedic Rehabilitation Clinics OHSU Nerve conduction study . If conduct study potential participant show evidence mild moderate Carpal Tunnel Syndrome s/he inform study invite participate additional screening . B ) Patients see National College Natural Medicine ( NCNM ) Clinics clinical diagnosis Carpal Tunnel Syndrome inform study invite enter screen process eligibility . C ) Participants also recruit general public include staff student OHSU NCNM ) . Eligibility determine stepwise process include telephone screen general eligibility , Nerve Conduction screen electrodiagnostic eligibility , Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire screen symptom severity eligibility . Those potential participant meet eligibility requirement randomize one three magnetic field dosage . They provide ¾ '' diameter x 1/8 '' thick magnet require apply six week hour sleep . Over course study participant four visit General Clinical Research Center OHSU three visit Orthopaedic Rehabilitation Clinics OHSU Nerve Conduction study perform either Dr. Nels Carlson Dr. Hans Carlson . Questionnaires complete course study include general health information demographic questionnaire , Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire , complete six occasion , general symptom checklist Post Treatment Participant satisfaction questionnaire . Recruitment , retention , compliance safety analyze use descriptive statistic . Effectiveness three different strength magnet assess compare participant ' baseline score Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire score six week magnet use .</brief_summary>
