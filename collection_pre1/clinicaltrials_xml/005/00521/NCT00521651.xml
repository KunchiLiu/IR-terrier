	<brief_summary>This protocol sub-study ongoing `` Protect Health Reduce Cancer Risk '' study conduct Shanghai , China , sponsor Shanghai Cancer Institute , Vanderbilt University , National Cancer Institute . The parent study design examine relationship diet , lifestyle , occupational , environmental risk factor , well genetic variation , cancer incidence large cohort men woman 40 70 year age . The current sub-study ass validity reliability new physical activity questionnaire use parent study evaluate whether different type activity frequency , intensity , duration activity associate marker link cancer risk , C-reactive protein , interleukin 6 soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha . Participants current 12-month study select among men woman participate `` Protect Health Reduce Cancer Risk '' study . Participants keep diary physical activity complete two 30-minute interview physical activity , one begin one end study period . Every 3 month 7 consecutive day , wear pager-sized activity monitor waist record physical activity pattern period time . They provide blood urine sample four time study , end study , undergo health examination include electrocardiogram , body composition measurement , physical fitness test . The fitness test step-test consist 3-minute stage subject successively increase step speed reach 85 percent predict maximal heart rate . Blood urine sample analyze level nutrient certain protein , store future study relate nutrition physical activity possibly genetic study relate health , nutrition , exercise , disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In past decade , China experience fundamental decrease population ' physical activity level , due increasingly sedentary occupation lifestyle . However , transition Western lifestyle reach entire Chinese population . The result wide range between-person variation physical activity provide unparalleled opportunity physical activity study . Although physical activity measurement technique evolve considerably past year , main obstacle quantify physical activity complexity precisely measure individual component , particularly low moderate-intensity activity . Recently , investigator Vanderbilt University , Shanghai Cancer Institute , DCEG initiate two prospective population-based cohort study : Shanghai Women 's Cohort Shanghai Men 's Cohort . The aim study prospectively examine relation diet , lifestyle , occupational , environmental risk factor , well genetic variation , cancer incidence among 75,000 woman 73,000 men , age 40 70 year old , reside Shanghai , China . We propose coduct study among 600 woman men participate two cohort study . The specific objective current study develop comprehensive physical activity questionnaire ass validity reliability instrument Shanghai cohort use objective measure physical activity/physical fitness : activity monitor , Modified Canadian Aerobic Fitness Test . In addition , intend evaluate whether different type parameter physical activity associate circulating level specific inflammatory marker link cancer risk . The specific marker C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) , soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-a ) . The impact potentially confound variable association physical activity inflammatory marker , recent exercise , use anti-inflammatory drug , current recent infection , carefully account analysis .</detailed_description>
