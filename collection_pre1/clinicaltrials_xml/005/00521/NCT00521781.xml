	<brief_title>Study Abraxane Plus Hormonal Therapy Initial Treatment Unresectable Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abraxane potent anticancer drug stop cancer cell grow divide interfere certain cell structure kill cancer cell . Abraxane first albumin-bound taxane particle approximately 130 nanometer take advantage albumin , natural carrier water-insoluble molecule ( e.g. , various nutrient , vitamin , hormone ) find human . Albumin protein act body 's key transporter nutrient water-insoluble molecule selectively accumulate tumor tissue . The delivery chemotherapy/hormone therapy set androgen-independent prostate cancer demonstrate : survival benefit associate PSA decline tolerable toxicity , thus strongly suggest disease modify potential exists . Preclinical data support benefit simultaneous chemotherapy/hormonal therapy androgen deprivation . The stage set chemotherapy/hormonal therapy give earlier men prostate cancer . Data suggest transformation androgen-dependent androgen-independent phenotype mediate expansion androgen-independent clone already present time androgen deprivation . If model correct , would feasible bring chemotherapy/hormonal therapy front correspond tumor burden minimal . It hop bring therapy component tumor initially , emergence androgen-independent growth delay , ultimately prolong patient survival . This study test hypothesis Abraxane plus hormonal therapy follow standard hormonal therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic proof adenocarcinoma prostate . Patients must belong one four group : 1 ) Local/Regional prior definitive therapy : Patients local/regional recurrence follow prostatectomy radiation therapy still normal bone scan . 2 ) Local/Regional without prior definitive therapy : Patients felt unresectable , felt candidate , radiation therapy . 3 ) Low volume bone disease : Patients 1 2 bone metastasis . 4 ) High volume bone/visceral disease : Patients ≥ 3 metastatic bone sit visceral metastasis . Patients meet criterion eligible even without radiographically demonstrable abnormality . All patient must elevate PSA prior initial hormone exposure define : 1 ) For patient prior prostatectomy , PSA must rise associate doubling time ≤ 3 month . 2 ) For patient prior radiation therapy , PSA must ≥ 1.0 ng/mL associate doubling time ≤ 3 month . 3 ) For patient prostate place , PSA must elevate biopsy proven disease candidate local therapy . Patients may LHRH agonist ( without antiandrogen ) , already medically castrate , time study entry , provide therapy start within 3 month study entry . No previous cytotoxic systemic therapy kind allow , include systemic irradiation strontium89 samarium . Previous definitive radiotherapy one metastatic site acceptable . At least 8 week must elapse since radiation therapy pelvis . Patients limited irradiation single metastatic site eligible 4 week follow completion radiation . Patients may previous exposure androgen deprivation therapy give ≤ 6 month , `` downstage '' primary , provide therapy complete least 12 month prior entry study . Patients must free serious comorbidity life expectancy ≥ 3 year . Patients must adequate physiologic reserve evidence Zubrod Performance Status ( ZPS ) ≤ 2 , adequate bone marrow function , renal function liver function evidence active ischemia ECG ( clinically indicate , documentation EF ≥ 40 % . ) Patients must second malignancy unless confidence previous curative therapy . Patients recent history TIA ( within 6 month ) , require regular antianginal therapy claudication sufficient limit activity eligible . Patients previous history deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism ( within 12 month ) eligible . Patients must serious intercurrent medical psychiatric illness , include serious active infection . Patients must Sensory neuropathy grade 1 great .</criteria>
