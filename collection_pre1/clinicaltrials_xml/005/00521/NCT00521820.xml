	<brief_title>Safety Comparison Pioglitazone Glyburide Type 2 Diabetes Subjects With Mild Moderate Congestive Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 16 million people United States diagnose type 2 diabetes , prevalence rate approximately 6 % , number expect increase increase age general population . The risk factor associate development type 2 diabetes , age , obesity , diet exercise habit , also contribute development cardiovascular disease . Additionally , patient diabetes increase risk development microvascular macrovascular disease . With regard congestive heart failure , risk congestive heart failure increase subject diabetes absence coronary artery disease ; subject diabetes establish coronary artery disease high overall risk great risk severe congestive heart failure . There evidence increase insulin sensitivity reduce hyperinsulinemia may reduce cardiovascular risk reduce blood pressure , improve endothelial function , cardiac remodel function . Pioglitazone thiazolidinedione treatment type 2 diabetes , agonist peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor . Pioglitazone receive marketing approval United States 1999 . As part approval process , Takeda fulfil postmarketing study evaluate effect pioglitazone treatment type 2 diabetes subject congestive heart failure a6-month clinical study . An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board use monitor overall safety pattern study conduct unblinded review data find difference composite endpoint time first event approach nominal statistical significance favor glyburide . As result , committee recommend Takeda terminate trial . Consistent regulatory agency requirement , Takeda submit abbreviated report focus safety data derive terminate study .</detailed_description>
