	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Cardiac troponins sensitive marker myocardial injury ACS even minor elevation cardiac troponins associate increase risk future adverse coronary event . However , detectable troponin release occur part patient admit ACS . The clinical outcome prognosis patient ACS absent TnT release vary widely , identification potential high-risk patient troponin negative ACS still remain major problem clinical routine . Therefore , aim study focus identify new biomarkers risk stratification . Activated Factor XII : Activated Factor XII lead contact activation number pathophysiological process , include hypotension , inflammation , thrombosis fibrinolysis , affect contact activation follow activation XIIa . Several study demonstrate relation XIIa coronary artery heart disease ( CAD ) ( 1,2,3,4 ) XIIa level post MI predict recurrent coronary occlusive event play role independent risk marker patient ( 5 ) . However , detailed mechanism XIIa ` action CAD still remain uncertain although recent finding animal study use FXII deficient mouse indicate Factor XII essential arterial thrombus formation ( 6 ) . Recent research indicate in-vivo XIIa exist multiple type in-vivo XIIa exist circulation complexed variety protein ( 7 ) . To date , data exist prognostic value specific in-vivo type XIIa outcome patient chest pain and/or ACS . B-type natriuretic peptide : B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) counter-regulatory peptide hormone predominantly synthesize ventricular myocardium . BNP release circulation response ventricular dilatation pressure overload , reflect ventricular wall stress tissue hypoxia rather cell injury per se ( 8 , 9 ) . It well know marker leave ventricular dysfunction heart failure ( HF ) , provide prognostic information beyond leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) ( 10 ) . This marker neurohormonal activation inflammation play pivotal role across spectrum ACS , include patient ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( MI ) non ST-elevation ACS ( NSTE-ACS ) . Previous study demonstrate BNP measure first day onset symptom independently predict mortality , HF , new MI patient population . Elevated natriuretic peptide presentation show identify patient ACS high risk death HF , add information provide troponins ( 11-13 ) . However , low-risk population association elevate BNP survival attenuate adjustment make echocardiographic variable ( addition clinical covariates ) , show Wang colleague . In addition , find association baseline BNP risk coronary heart disease ( CHD ) ( 14 ) . High-sensitive C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) : C-reactive protein ( CRP ) acute-phase reactant produce response acute injury , infection inflammation stimulus . It marker underlie systemic inflammation play important role initiation propagation atherosclerosis ultimately plaque rupture ensue thrombotic complication ( 15 ) Elevated level CRP first report patient hospitalize NSTE-ACS early 1990s ( 16 , 17 ) . Through use appropriate high-sensitive assay , possible investigate relationship plasma CRP level previously consider normal cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Nevertheless , still debate marker prefer risk prediction ( 18 , 19 ) . It suggest combined evaluation BNP CRP may yield incremental prognostic information risk stratification patient ACS ( 20 ) , combine use show improve long-term risk prediction mortality patient stable CHD ( 21 ) . To knowledge , limited data available directly compare two marker prospective manner unselected patient population present emergency department ( ED ) chest pain . In addition , role risk stratification patient ACS still evaluation , therefore additional investigation necessary . Omega- 3 Index : The value Omega-3 Index prognostic marker acute coronary syndrome still investigation . STUDY DESIGN This prospective single center observational non-invasive trial include 871 men woman admit chest pain potential ACS Stavanger University Hospital November 2002 October 2003 . Blood sample collect immediately follow admission . Patients stratify accord peak troponin T ( TnT ) release follow admission ; i.e . 1 ) patient admission TnT exceed 0.05 ng/mL , 2 ) patient peak TnT level 0.05 ng/mL low . Assessment history previous MI , angina pectoris ( AP ) , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , diabetes mellitus arterial hypertension base hospital record personal interview . Electrocardiographic finding admission classify accord presence ST segment change . Written inform consent obtain patient . Survival status , date cause death clinical data obtain telephone interview hospital journal report 4 predefined time point ( 30 day , 6 , 12 24 month ) two year follow-up period . In case incapacity provide information , general practitioner nursery home contact relevant data . Hospital journal search confirmation report data . Primary Outcome Measures : - During follow-up - All cause death - Non-fatal acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) - Combined endpoint cause death non-fatal acute MI - Combined endpoint cardiovascular death non-fatal acute MI Secondary Outcome Measures : - During follow-up - Acute hospitalization angina - Myocardial revascularization STEERING COMMITTEE - Professor Dennis WT Nilsen MD PhD , Department Heart Disease , Stavanger University Hospital - Heidi Grundt MD PhD Department Medicine , Stavanger University Hospital - Ã˜yvind Hetland MD PhD , Department Clinical Chemistry , Stavanger University Hospital - Ole Kristensen MD , Department Clinical Chemistry , Stavanger University Hospital BIOLOGICAL SAMPLE OWNERSHIP .
