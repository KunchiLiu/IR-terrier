	<brief_title>Multivalent Conjugate Vaccine Trial Patients With Biochem . Relapsed Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot trial design assess safety immunogenicity multivalent conjugate vaccine use patient biochemically relapsed prostate cancer . This trial base result eight dose-seeking phase I monovalent glycoprotein carbohydrate conjugate vaccine trial patient population minimal tumor burden despite rise biomarker , PSA , fail primary therapy surgery radiation . We know rise PSA indicative micrometastatic disease - state immune system may maximally respond . Based trial , identify three glycolipid antigen , Globo H , Lewisy GM2 three mucin antigen , glycosylated MUC-1 , Tn ( c ) , TF ( c ) inclusion multivalent trial . As result vaccination , patient generate specific high titer IgM IgG antibody respective antigen-KLH conjugate . Our previous work show monovalent vaccine safe local erythema edema minimal systemic toxicity . Our data approximately 160 men participate earlier monovalent vaccine trial aforementioned antigen show treatment effect form decline PSA log slope compare pretreatment value could see patient minimal tumor burden . The multivalent vaccine consist low dose synthetic glycoprotein carbohydrate antigen show elicit high titer IgM IgG antibodies patient biochemically relapsed prostate cancer . A phase III double blind randomize trial two hundred forty patient plan base safety immunogenicity data accrue pilot trial . The primary endpoint study safety vaccine humoral response antigen . The secondary endpoint evaluate post-therapy change PSA .</detailed_description>
