	<brief_summary>The purpose research study level acid exposure gastroesophageal junction distal esophagus patient reflux symptom use capsule type acid measurement system . Patients reflux symptom likely acid reflux junction stomach esophagus may help improve diagnosis gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) . This may help good treat reflux symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Upper gastrointestinal symptom disease , specifically dyspepsia acid reflux common problem face adult U.S. population . These symptom frequently necessitate upper gastrointestinal endoscopy , perform rule anatomic disease . Moreover , symptom associate complication erosive esophagitis , Barrett 's esophagus , peptic ulcer disease gastric cancer . The role level acid ( pH level ) patient present symptom poorly define previous study since use catheter base pH system provide recording 24 hour , single location esophagus stomach , associate patient discomfort lead inconsistent result . This pilot project attempt study level acid exposure distal esophagus proximal stomach patient correlate symptom . Many individual Western world trouble heartburn , acid regurgitation , abdominal pain ( dyspepsia ) , bowel habit disturbance ; one two subject cross sectional population base study report symptom . Gastro-esophageal reflux ( GERD ) probably common chronic disease population Western world . The reported prevalence symptomatic GERD range , average , 15 % 25 % . Similarly , dyspepsia common condition general population ; report prevalence range population 15-40 % . The majority patient functional ( non-ulcer ) dyspepsia underlie structural explanation symptom , peptic ulcer disease reflux esophagitis . However , give significant morbidity absence work associate condition , pathogenesis treatment patient dyspepsia still require research . Studies thus need determine long term effect symptom healthcare cost short run determine correlation symptom acid level acid exposure . Upper Gastrointestinal Diseases &amp; pH Recording : Continuous esophageal pH recording widely use study GERD treatment ( 5 ) . Gastric pH recording less use clinically , monitor gastric pH use pharmacological comparison various anti-secretory agent . Continuous pH recording esophagus stomach usually display graphs pH versus time percentage time pH particular value ( often 4.0 ) . Although doubt gastric acidity directly involve GERD pathogenesis , relationship gastric esophageal acidity clear . Lack focus gastric acid may relate general belief gastric acid secretion usually normal GERD . Distinct pattern esophageal acidity GERD previously report . There clear relationship descriptor present finding integrate esophageal acidity . Previous pH-based analysis nicely correlate esophagitis grade acid exposure , gastric acidity somewhat neglect major determinant esophageal acid exposure GERD aside observation acid inhibition could diminish esophageal acid exposure . Hirschowitz report basal pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion esophagitis comparable unspecified medical condition without esophagitis . Others , however , report increased basal , peak , maximal gastric acid secretion GERD compare healthy subject . In study gastro-esophageal reflux , esophageal pH electrode traditionally position proximal limit low esophageal sphincter ( LES ) . This convention adopt early avoid electrode slip stomach swallow esophagus shortens 2-3 cm . As consequence , conventionally place electrode detect acid refluxing distal esophagus reach point 5 cm LES . If acid exposure distal esophagus proximal stomach great conventional measuring point proximal LES , could significance clinically . This reflux distal esophagus proximal stomach may explain high incidence metaplasia neoplasia distal esophagus occur general population . Previous study patient dyspepsia reveal either normal level pH mildly elevate level stomach . The correlation symptom acid level test previous study . The distal esophagus gastroesophageal junction expose significant amount gastric acid , even subject without reflux dyspeptic symptom . This importance understand pathophysiology disease also treatment acid suppressive medication . Data lack benefit effective acid inhibition proton pump inhibitor dyspepsia . In two large , double blind multicenter clinical trial , BOND OPERA , patient ( n=1262 ) functional dyspepsia randomize four week treatment omeprazole 20 mg 10 mg daily , placebo . The primary efficacy variable complete absence symptom . The BOND OPERA trial show significant benefit omeprazole placebo . Pooling BOND OPERA trial , complete relief symptom achieve 38.2 % 20 mg omeprazole group ( p=0.002 ) 36.0 % 10 mg omeprazole group ( p=0.02 ) compare 28.2 % placebo group suggest acid suppression may play role treatment symptom . However , future treatment study conduct , correlation patient symptom level esophageal gastric pH level important . Current practice measure esophageal gastric pH : The current catheter base 24-hr pH system involve placement catheter esophagus stomach via nostril . The tip catheter sensor measure esophageal gastric pH . The patient sent home ( catheter place , tip come one nostril ) give box measure pH exposure . This uncomfortable patient , leading change daily activity , diet , etc . result data probably reflective `` daily habit '' . Moreover , since catheter pass blindly esophagus stomach , exact location pH measurement probably accurate . The Bravo pH System : The Bravo pH system ( FDA approve ) novel capsule base wireless test system , allow capsule , size kidney bean , attach esophagus stomach endoscopy perform . This attachment help use small clip , detaches pass patient stool . Preliminary study use Bravo pH capsule show good tolerability use , presence 48-hour result well good correlation acid suppressive therapy patient . To study level acid exposure stomach distal esophagus patient upper gastrointestinal disease symptom , specifically dyspepsia acid reflux use novel pH system . Study Design : Patients present gastroenterology endoscopy unit upper gastrointestinal symptom invite participate study . The patient 's symptom accurately note use standardize validated questionnaire . All patient undergo standard upper endoscopy . The patient demographic include age , gender , ethnicity note . The findings time upper endoscopy presence hiatal hernia , erosive esophagitis , ulcer disease , H. pylorus infection , cancer record . After endoscopic procedure , two Bravo pH capsule place distal esophagus proximal stomach landmark determine endoscopically . The patient provide single pH recorder ask return Gastroenterology unit lab , 24-48 hour placement . Patients encourage continue routine activity include meal . They fill second questionnaire end study regard discomfort may experience Bravo capsule . Data record regarding level acid exposure site esophagus stomach , patient demographic comfort . Safety Evaluation : Patients undergo Bravo previous study report chest discomfort , chest pain , abdominal pain , nausea . No major complication report . Thus , significant risk patient undergoing procedure , except standard endoscopy , already schedule .</detailed_description>
