	<brief_summary>Objectives : 1 . To show feasibility reproducibility perform multiplex ligation-dependent amplification procedure ( RT-MLPA ) 2 . To describe profile change inflammatory gene product , use RT-MLPA , pediatric patient receive stem cell transplant 3 . To determine change specific inflammatory product , combination inflammatory product , predict grade 2-4 acute graft-versus-host disease</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ( HSCT ) successful treatment option multiple malignant disease ( i.e . leukemia ) non-malignant disorder ( i.e . metabolic disorder , genetic disorder , immunodeficiency ) . Unfortunately , transplantation HLA-related family member available 30-40 % stem cell transplant recipient . The patient require HSCT must receive stem cell either matched-unrelated donor ( MUD ) cord blood . One major limitation upon receive unrelated stem cell acute chronic graft-versus-host disease . Specifically look acute graft-versus-host disease ( aGVHD ) , 30 % recipient stem cell HLA-identical related donor develop great equal grade 2 aGVHD despite immunosuppressive prophylaxis . The percentage patient develop aGVHD unrelated donor even high . The current standard treatment aGVHD corticosteroid . Unfortunately , 40 % matched-siblings HSCT case 25 % MUD SCT case show complete response steroid . Those patient respond corticosteroid show dismal outcome . Given poor outcome refractory GVHD , lot interest try predict get GVHD . These finding could lead augmentation GVHD prophylaxis . The purpose study look series identify biomarkers predict aGVHD . Once blood drawn SCT recipient , multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification ( MLPA ) test different biomarkers blood result 30-45 target sequence examine simultaneously .</detailed_description>
