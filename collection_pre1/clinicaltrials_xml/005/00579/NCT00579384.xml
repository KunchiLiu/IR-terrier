	<brief_title>A Study Effects JNJ-26489112 Photic Induced Paroxysmal Electroencephalogram ( EEG ) Response Patients With Photosensitive Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , non-randomized ( participant assign deliberately ) , single-blind ( patient know treatment receiving ) , within patient placebo-controlled study . Up 32 male female patient participate study . The duration subject participation approximately 6 week . Patients receive oral dos study drug morning Days 1 , 2 , 3 . All patient receive single dose placebo Day 1 , single dose JNJ-26489112 Day 2 , second single dose placebo Day 3 . Blood sample take evaluation JNJ-26489112 drug concentration plasma blood . Blood sample also collect laboratory safety assessment measurement antiepileptic drug concentration . Further safety assess report adverse event , vital sign , 12-lead ECG , physical neurological examination . Patients discharge even Day 3 pharmacokinetic sample collect , assessment investigator , unless ongoing adverse event require in-house monitoring . EEG tracing , record intermittent photic stimulation session , digitally record CD-ROM , cod evaluate independently one blind clinical expert determine effect photosensitivity range . If complete suppression photosensitivity reduction photosensitivity range least 3 point photosensitivity scale least one eye condition ( closure , close , open ) observe least 3 4 patient maximum tolerate dose reach , study stop . If reduction photosensitivity range least 3 point photosensitivity scale least one eye condition ( closure , close , open ) observe least 3 4 patient ( complete suppression least 2 patient ) first cohort , dose level JNJ-26489112 may reduce subsequent cohort reduction suppression photosensitivity see few 2 4 patient one cohort . Once effective dose reach additional open-label cohort may enrol study drug ( JNJ-26489112 placebo ) administer patient . Study drug ( i.e. , JNJ-26489112 placebo ) administer orally single dos Days 1 3 . Placebo administered Days 1 3 , single dose JNJ-26489112 administer Day 2 .</detailed_description>
