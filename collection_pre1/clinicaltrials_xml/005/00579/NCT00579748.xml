	<brief_summary>Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) non-invasive imaging technique use light create picture live tissue successfully use generate high resolution cross-sectional image tissue human eye skin . OCT system commercially available eye skin use , several clinical report use OCT gastrointestinal tract publish well . The purpose study develop high-speed noninvasive OCT probe place endoscope early diagnosis pre-cancerous cancerous lesion gastrointestinal tract . This pilot clinical research study design advance OCT technology , may future able replace augment endoscopic biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Protocol Summary The long term objective propose research develop high-speed noninvasive endoscopic functional optical coherence tomography ( F-OCT ) device use microelectromechanical system ( MEMS ) technology early diagnosis tumor lesions gastrointestinal tract . Study Design All patient undergo endoscopy UCIMC CDDC meet eligibility criterion candidate enrollment protocol . Signed informed consent obtain . Standard Care Procedure The patient undergo standard care endoscopy . Endoscopy perform routine basis conscious sedation general anesthesia . Digital image video clip area interest capture usual standard care fashion . Research Procedure The OCT probe insert biopsy channel endoscope GI tract lumen OCT image acquire lesion prior biopsy ( research procedure ) . In addition , OCT image take surround normal tissue . Primary Endpoint The OCT image correlate specific biopsy site biopsy number . OCT Device Probe Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) emerge image modality use light image turbid medium live tissue , successfully use generate high resolution ( ~10 micron ) cross-sectional image tissue microstructure human retina skin . OCT device commercially available ophthalmic dermatologic use , several clinical report use OCT vascular system aerodigestive tract publish well . The OCT device optical imaging instrument combine broadband low power near infrared light source ( non-laser ) interferometer produce cross-sectional optical image tissue depths 1-2 mm . OCT already use commercially image retina skin . This study focus device design specifically aerodigestive tract . The OCT probe design fit biopsy channel standard endoscope . The probe design three different type mechanism . ( 1 ) The first mechanism consist fiber optic micro lens prism attached end direct light tissue sample . Scanning achieve move fiber optic along axis use linear motor . Longitudinal OCT image realize mechanism . Similar probe already use laryngoscopic OCT study . ( 2 ) The second mechanism achieve rotational MEMS motor , angle mirror attach direct light side . Rotational imaging realize mechanism . ( 3 ) The third mechanism base silicon MEMS technology . The scanner create polysilicon micromirror driven high frequency , thick single crystal silicon comb drive . The high speed scan probe large scan angle , excellent optical property , high precision , long-term reliability . The overall cross-sectional diameter approximately 3 mm able fit biopsy channel endoscope . The OCT device focus incident low-coherence light onto tissue collect backscatter coherent photon . The endoscopists obtain cross sectional optical image tissue arbitrary plane section .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients know Barrett 's esophagus without dysplasia , schedule surveillance endoscopy biopsy endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) . Patients early esophageal gastric cancer undergo confirmatory endoscopy biopsy . These cancer must limit T1 N0 M0 ( tumor invades submucosa lymph node involvement metastasis ) accord American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJC ) Guidelines ( 1988 later ) . Tumors may either adenocarcinoma squamous cell cancer . EUS CT scanning require confirm tumor stag . Tumors must limit mucosa submucosa examine high frequency cEUS . Any thickness tumor lesion acceptable provide lesion appear reach muscularis propria . Patients intestinal metaplasia without dysplasia stomach undergo endoscopy biopsy EMR . Patients must least 18 year age . Female patient must pregnant ( must negative serum pregnancy test ) nursing , must practice medically acceptable form birth control sterile postmenopausal . Patients must sign informed consent . Patients esophageal gastric cancer , tumor extension muscularis propria endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) ( i.e . tumor depth invasion T2 great ) . Patients esophageal stricture unresponsive dilation . Patients known contraindication analgesia endoscopy . Patients inability understand carry instruction .</criteria>
