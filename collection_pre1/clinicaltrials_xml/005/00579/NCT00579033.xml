	<brief_summary>Patients focal dystonia experience uncontrollable movement hand certain type skilled movement . Though origin disorder fully understood , think brain area involve move hand receive touch information hand , involve . For example , patient dystonia affect hand show change ability perceive touch - something typically escape patient awareness . Further , area brain receive touch information disrupt representation finger skin surface . The goal research improve dystonia symptom patient hand dystonia . We attempt achieve goal implement intensive training treatment require patient attend , use touch information apply specific fingertip . Previous work attempt alter touch perception use sensory training improvement motor control ( hand write ) dystonia patient observe . For example , learn read Braille improves tactile perception handwrite focal hand dystonia . A different approach treat focal hand dystonia involve technique call repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) , also temporarily improve hand write dystonia patient . The propose research attempt alter touch processing use touch training alone , combination rTMS . Rather train use Braille reading , sensory training apply use systematic , experimenter control stimulus set focus touch stimulus apply individual digit . Importantly patient associate certain type touch information reward touch input lack reward . The study first involve measure location representation touch brain use multiple brain mapping tool . These tool include functional magnetic resonance imaging magnetoencephalography ; tool use accurate picture finger representation obtain , also know brain area respond touch stimulus . Dystonia symptom touch perception also assess . Next , patient participate train intervention involve 15 day ( 2.5 hr/day ) touch training apply fingertip dystonia affect hand . Patients identify touch target amongst distractors receive on-line performance feedback . The goal training provide cortex regular boundary finger way , attempt re-shape sensory cortex accept boundary . Another group patient receive rTMS . The goal rTMS create environment sensory cortex open 'ready ' accept change induce tactile stimulation . The rTMS immediately follow tactile training . A third group patient receive placebo version rTMS follow tactile training . The latter group allow u understand rTMS definite effect physiology patient . Following 15-day training , ass brain representation fingertip , change dystonia symptom change perception touch stimulus . This research advance treatment focal hand dystonia assist design precise remediation training tailor dystonia patient .</brief_summary>
