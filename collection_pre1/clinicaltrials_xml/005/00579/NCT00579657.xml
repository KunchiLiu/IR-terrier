	<detailed_description>This randomize control single-blinded intervention study 111 overweight obese subject risk factor develop type 2 diabetes , aim investigate effect isoenergetic high cereal fiber versus high protein diet 6 18 week . We also investigate effect combine high-cereal-fiber/high-protein ( mix ) diet , effect control group . All diet base food plant whey product commonly assume healthy . This trial design proof principle study focus participant likely adhere respective isoenergetic diet , order show whether high protein versus high cereal fiber diet indeed affect insulin sensitivity , indicate epidemiological observation . Study participant receive intensive regular nutritional advice order achieve respective dietary target . Dietary adherence participant support provide tailor dietary supplement four group , twice daily 18 week . Supplements provide twice daily consumption participant four dietary intervention group , throughout 18-wk intervention ( participant instruct consume total 252 portion tailor supplement intervention , hand participant seal single portion week 0 , 3 , 6 12 , total 63 portion occasion ) . The packaging seal portion 4 intervention arm indicate type dietary intervention participant , cod identification supplier . Energy content supplement consider calculate individual energy intake . Supplements specifically design intervention study , order facilitate achieve dietary target . A 6 week strictly control isoenergetic study period ( regular group individual session , daily food diaries/FFQs first 6 week adaptation food intake , necessary , indicated direct analysis FFQs food protocol , weigh participant ; 3-day food protocol week 0 , 6 , 12 , 18 ; various biomarkers dietary adherence ) follow 12 week ad libitum period , ongoing intake respective diet include supplement , dietary advice . The primary outcome measure detection diet-induced change insulin sensitivity weight maintain isoenergetic condition . Secondary outcome change factor may explain potential diet-induced alteration insulin sensitivity . During 12-weeks ad libitum period investigate potential effect respective diet change body weight , body composition biomarkers related energy intake . Participants re-invited anthropometric measurement measurement biomarkers blood ( 18 week completion study ) , well take second muscle tissue biopsy ( subset participant agree procedure ) .</detailed_description>
