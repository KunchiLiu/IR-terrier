	<brief_summary>The purpose study study normal sarcoma cell . To study cell need human tissue . You already procedure remove tissue . We would like use tissue . We use laboratory study diagnosis , behavior treatment sarcoma . We perform extensive analysis sample . We use extra tissue leave need test do remove additional small amount tissue biopsy . We also take blood sample and/or procedure measure biochemical factor may help u predict behavior sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Novel Biochemical Molecular Determinants Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In protocol , plan identify specific marker biochemical , proteomic , epigenetic molecular genetic analysis predict clinical outcome , responsiveness therapy might serve promise therapeutic target patient soft tissue sarcoma .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Sarcoma</mesh_term>
	<criteria>All patient know suspected sarcoma tissue remove therapeutic diagnostic purpose . Patients enter without preference particular racial/ethnic group gender . Patients may receive prior hormonal therapy , cytotoxic chemotherapy , irradiation , immunotherapy surgical therapy . Tissue specimens must large enough quantity allow routine pathologic analysis , research laboratory specimen remove residual specimen , would otherwise discard . Optimal tissue amount snap freeze : Core biopsy 2 tissue core Incisional biopsy 0.5 1.5 gram Resected sarcoma specimen 1.0 50 gram depend size specimen Normal fat muscle tissue 0.5 4.0 gram ( available resect sarcoma specimen ) Optimal tissue amount RNA later Core biopsy 2 tissue core Incisional biopsy 30 mg ( three 3 x 3 x 3 mm cube ) Resected sarcoma specimen 30 mg ( three 3 x 3 x 3 mm cube ) Normal fat muscle tissue 30 mg ( three 3 x 3 x 3 mm cube None</criteria>
