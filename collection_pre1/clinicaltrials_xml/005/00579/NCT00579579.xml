	<brief_summary>The purpose study find happen patient surgery rectal cancer . After treated rectal cancer , patient tell u bowel , bladder sexual function change . We try understand change affect quality life . The research explain change problem well . The patient ask question bowel function , bladder function , sexual function , quality life understand change well .

	<brief_title>Functional Outcomes Quality Life Patients Undergoing Surgery Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rectal cancer second common cancer North America . Therapy rapidly improve last 20 year , surgical technique total mesorectal excision , well advance radiation chemotherapy , result improved survival decrease local recurrence . As result , survivorship issue become increasingly important patient rectal cancer . Patients uniformly demonstrate strong desire avoid permanent stoma show strong preference sphincter preserve surgery ( SPS ) . With introduction circular stapler , SPS technically possible high proportion patient . Additionally , even tumor anorectal ring consider amenable SPS select patient ultra-low rectal cancer . At present , long-term outcome rectal cancer surgery poorly understood . Bowel , bladder sexual function appear negatively affected multi-modality therapy . However , function poorly study , difficult translate data clinically meaningful information patient . Clinically , bowel , bladder sexual dysfunction seem affect quality life ( QOL ) , although never well study . It important quantify extent impairment use educate patient preoperatively . However , translate data clinician patient remain challenging , effort convey data meaningful manner preoperatively constitute important element manage patient expectation . By understand patient ' baseline need , expectation satisfaction time preoperative consent , begin develop novel preoperative strategy educate patient postoperative function quality life meaningful manner , may better adapt surgery . We ultimately plan use data study develop subsequently evaluate role educational tool outline functional outcome rectal cancer surgery .</detailed_description>
