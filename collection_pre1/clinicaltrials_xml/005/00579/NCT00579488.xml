	<brief_summary>The goal study help u learn role gene cancer run family . Sometimes , born gene change alter . Gene change call mutation . Mutations may pass parent child . Some mutation cause high risk cancer . There two major gene breast ovarian cancer . These gene call BRCA -- breast cancer . If mutation gene special action may need . For person know mutation , suggest way screen cancer prevent . Not everything know cancer gene mutation . The cancer screen suggest may always effective . The aim study explore question . If agree stay touch follow medical history . We also ask family . This allow u measure cancer risk know mutation . The study also look cancer gene know . Whether take part study , may gene test . If take part study wish know , tell BRCA gene test result . The investigator may perform genetic test blood saliva sample one two way : analysis mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 gene alone part panel gene associate breast cancer predisposition . New technology employ identification patient susceptibility develop breast cancer thus analysis multiple gene one time may offer . If multi-gene test applies patient , question answer sheet test provide genetic counselor .</brief_summary>
