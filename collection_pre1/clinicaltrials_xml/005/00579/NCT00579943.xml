	<brief_summary>Advances newborn intensive care lead dramatic improvement survival premature infantsâ€”often weigh 1 pound birth . Unfortunately , cerebral palsy , mental retardation , developmental delay affect 10,000 premature infant U.S. annually . In study , Dr. Jeffrey R. Kaiser try understand premature infant high risk brain injury , learn way prevent injury . Experts believe disturbance brain blood flow regulation important causing injury . Using novel continuous monitoring system , Dr. Kaiser able determine infant 's capacity normal brain blood flow regulation . Contrary previous thinking , show many baby fact due normal regulation brain blood flow . He observe brain blood flow may disturb suction breathe tube . Further , also show infant high carbon dioxide , breathe well , impaired regulation brain blood flow . Thus , even stable infant prone disturbed brain regulation routine intensive care , may lead bleed brain long-term neurologic problem . Dr. Kaiser study 200 infant determine 1 ) developmental pattern normal regulation cerebral blood flow ; 2 ) impair regulation , determine develops first week life ; 3 ) determine relationship impair brain blood flow regulation brain injury . Results study help u recognize premature infant vulnerable develop brain injury , allow prevention intervention strategy initiate timely fashion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Regulation Cerebral Blood Flow Very Low Birth Weight Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proposal outline program study development cerebral autoregulation low birth weight ( VLBW ) ( less 1500 gram birth weight ) infant , role brain injury . Despite improvement intensive care , brain injury VLBW infant remain significant health problem . This due increase incidence prematurity increase survival rate VLBW infant prone develop intraventricular hemorrhage . Overwhelming evidence suggest disturbance autoregulation important pathogenesis injury . Autoregulation mechanism maintain constant blood flow brain despite wide variation blood pressure . However , previous study pool data infant different gestational postnatal age , little known autoregulation develop VLBW infant . A novel monitoring system use test central hypothesis cerebral autoregulatory capacity VLBW infant developmentally acquire disruption associate brain injury . The ontogenetic profile autoregulatory capacity VLBW infant determine . In lack autoregulation , postnatal time course development assess . Then relationship absence autoregulation brain injury establish . Two hundred VLBW infant normal finding cranial ultrasound day life 1 enrol . Continuous 1-hour measurement cerebral blood flow velocity ( transcranial Doppler ultrasound ) compare simultaneous measurement blood pressure use multivariate analysis , adjust variation arterial blood gas ( continuous blood gas monitor ) , determine autoregulatory capacity ( twice daily first 3 day life day 4-7 ) . Results analyze individual gestational age group ( 23-25 , 26-28 , great 29 week ' ) . Results study help u recognize VLBW infant vulnerable develop brain injury , allow prevention intervention strategy initiate timely fashion . Dr. Jeffrey Kaiser take advantage strong mentoring , protect research time outstanding academic resource University Arkansas Medical Sciences reach goal become independent investigator .</detailed_description>
