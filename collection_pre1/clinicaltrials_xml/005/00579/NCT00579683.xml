	<brief_summary>The purpose study try learn small molecule kinase inhibitor work treat lung cancer . Some early study show gefitinib , erlotinib similar drug likely work particular DNA change ( also know mutation ) find protein important lung cancer . This protein call epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . Since small molecule kinase inhibitor sometimes stop working , would like examine tumor learn medicine work well . Your tumor examine variety thing include change DNA EGFR . We also sequence part gene HER2 , HER3 , HER4 , KRAS , proteins think important lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal protocol determine mechanism resistance epidermal growth factor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI ) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . A number trial show small molecule kinase inhibitor active agent treatment NSCLC [ 1 ] . Clinically drug note produce dramatic infrequent response . Mutations epidermal growth factor receptor show correlate sensitivity gefitinib erlotinib [ 2,3 ] . However , know patient initial response EGFR-TKI eventually progress . The mechanism acquire clinical resistance inhibitor patient incompletely understood . This protocol study clinical characteristic biopsy tissue patient non-small cell lung cancer previous clinical response small molecule kinase inhibitor subsequently experience progression disease . The tissue specimen use carry laboratory study explore molecular basis sensitivity resistance small molecule kinase inhibitor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients diagnose unresectable metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) fulfill follow eligibility criterion consider eligible study . Patient must previously receive treatment small molecule kinase inhibitor target least , part , EGFR patient may receive treatment since treatment small molecule kinase inhibitor include radiation chemotherapy ) Development disease progression actively receive tyrosine kinase inhibitor Signed informed consent</criteria>
