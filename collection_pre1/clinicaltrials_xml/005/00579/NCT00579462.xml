	<brief_title>Methylated Genes Blood Biomarkers Advanced Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This cooperative research project involve patient Thoracic Oncology Service Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center , laboratory Dr. Peter Danenberg , Professor Biochemistry Molecular Biology , University Southern California / Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center Los Angeles , California . The primary objective measure proportion patient advance ( stage III-IV ) lung cancer methylated gene blood , determine response chemotherapy ( complete partial radiologic response ) patient advanced lung cancer render methylated gene undetectable blood . This research project enroll approximately 80 patient per year 4 year generate sample size approximately 320 patients.Blood collect participate patient baseline , close possible date baseline radiologic assessment . Three follow-up blood collection drawn , within 7-10 day follow-up radiologic evaluation .</detailed_description>
