	<brief_summary>Complex Regional Pain Syndrome debilitate extremely difficult treat condition . There large body evidence demonstrate therapeutic value N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) -receptor antagonists CRPS . The NMDA antagonist ketamine show effective treatment CRPS , result complete remission disease patient . The purpose study evaluate intravenous outpatient infusion sub-anesthetic dos ketamine treatment CRPS . A thorough evaluation procedure , provide information degree relief constellation RSD symptoms best alleviated procedure would result optimization therapy treatment CRPS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Double Blind Placebo Controlled Study Outpatient Intravenous Ketamine Treatment CRPS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRE TREATMENT : Prior treatment , informed consent obtain , subject randomize ketamine placebo ( normal saline ) infusion group . Both patient individual involve study blind treatment except Guillermo Alexander PhD responsible randomization Margaret Rose RN responsible prepare infusion solution . The patient receive complete neurological examination ask complete short form McGill Quality life questionnaire ( Attachment 1 ) . Two week treatment , 2 week 3 month post treatment follow sensory motor test perform . Thermal Detection Thresholds : Cool detection threshold , mediate via A fiber warm detection threshold , mediate small unmyelinated C fiber , determine use TSA-II NeuroSensory Analyzer ( Medoc Advanced Medical Systems U.S. , Minneapolis , MN ) . The device consist computer control thermoelectric probe surface area 9 cm2 attach use velcro strap area skin test ( thenar eminence hypothenar eminence hand dorsal foot ) . For trial thermal stimulator start thermo-neutral baseline temperature 32oC , increase warm threshold , decrease cool threshold , linearly rate 1oC per second , subject push button stop record temperature return unit baseline temperature . Three trial average cool warm threshold site test . Thermal Pain : Thermal pain tolerance determine site use method describe thermal detection threshold . The difference thermal pain trial , subject instruct push control button ( immediately reset stimulator back baseline temperature ) thermal stimulus ( cold hot ) become painful . The TSA-II hardware automatically reset temperature reach -10oC ( cool ) 50oC ( heat ) control button push . This temperature range determine cause damage skin underlying tissue . Dynamic Mechano-allodynia : Dynamic mechano-allodynia determine stroke skin three time within 5 second rate 5 cm/sec 2.5 cm wide standard foam paintbrush . Allodynia severity measure subject 's response use numerical rating scale . The subject report amount pain 0-10 scale ( 0 : pain ; 10 : worst pain ever experience ) extent sensation spread . Static Mechano-allodynia Temporal Summation : Static mechano-allodynia temporal summation determine pin-prick standard safety pin every three second total 5 time . The subject instruct report level pain 0-10 scale ( 0 : pain ; 10 : worst pain ever experience ) extent sensation spread repetition . The test stop subject report unacceptable pain point test . Deep pressure pain threshold : Deep pressure pain threshold determine pressure algometer ( Wagner Instruments , Greenwich , CT ) hand hold device 1cm2 rub¬ber tip capable measure applied pressure 0-5 kg . The device hold 90o angle body surface test . The pressure gradually increase 1 kg/second subject report stimulus painful pressure 4 kg/cm2 reach . In upper extremity threshold pain determine : 1 ) second costosternal joint ; 2 ) acromioclavicular joint ; 3 ) lateral epicondyle ; 4 ) radial styloid ; 5 ) ulnar styloid ; 6 ) second metacarpal ; 6 ) fifth metacarpal . In low extremity threshold pain determine : 1 ) great trochanter ; 2 ) lateral femoral condyle ; 3 ) tibial tubercle ; 4 ) mid shin ; 5 ) medial malleolus ; 6 ) lateral malleolus ; 7 ) first metatarsal ; 8 ) fifth metatarsal . Quantification Motor Function ( finger tap ) : Finger tap rate determine use computer program develop group . The subject instruct press spacebar standard computer keyboard fast possible index finger hand respectively 30 second . The program determine rate plot result . Cutaneous Temperature : Skin temperature measure use infra-red thermometer ( Dermatemp Infrared Temperature Scanner , model DT-1001 , Exergen Corp. , Watertown , MA ) A pregnancy test administer female child bear potential blood also draw SMA-20 , CBC w/ Differential full thyroid panel . All subject ask wear activity watch treatment begin ( two week ) . This watch ( Attachment 2 ) evaluate subject 's level activity random program interval record subject 's pain level two week prior treatment . This accomplish sound tone time subject instructed press key pad enter number 0-10 ( 0 = pain 10 = unbearable pain ) . The patient ask complete short form McGill Quality life questionnaire weekly start infusion . PRE INFUSION : On first day treatment prior start infusion , patient weigh , undergo neurologic exam , vital sign evaluate intravenous line insert . On ten treatment day , patient ketamine placebo group place cardiac monitor cardiac rhythm , blood pressure , pulse oxygen saturation monitoring . In addition , Clonidine ( 0.1 mg , po ) Versed ( 4 mg , iv ) administer . Clonidine show , animal , potentiate neuropathic pain-relieving action NMDA receptor blocker like ketamine prevent neurotoxic side effect . Versed dose , provide mild sedation relief anxiety . INFUSION PLAN : All patient infuse intravenously 100 ml normal saline without ketamine four hour ( 25 ml/hr ) daily 10 day . The maximum intravenous ketamine infusion dose study 0.35 mg/kg/hr , exceed 25 mg/hr ( 100 mg ketamine 4 hour period ) . On first day , intravenous ketamine infusion set 50 % maximum rate . On second day , intravenous ketamine infusion increase 75 % maximum rate . On third day , intravenous ketamine infusion increase maximum rate . The daily ketamine infusion rate maintain level duration ten day study . CONSIDERATIONS : ( Other Treatments Meds ) Increased salivation : Glycopyrrolate ( Robinul ) Initially 1mg TID maintenance dose BID prn Psychiatric symptom : Ativan 1mg - HAVE AVAILABLE prn Continued use current medication exception NMDA receptor blocker amantadine , memantine , Magnesium sulfate . Administer adjuncts prn O2 2-3 L/min . via Nasal Cannula - HAVE AVAILABLE prn LABS : Ketamine Level ( red top tube ) infusion day 1 , 5 , 6 10 . NURSING CARE &amp; ORDERS : During IV Ketamine Infusion : Continuous cardiac monitoring , Pulse oximetry q 1 hr blood pressure monitor V/S q 1 hr Versed ( 2 mg iv ) administration may repeat two hour completion infusion . Activity : Patient leave infusion chair assistance bathroom visit . Patient allow bring head set ( music ) book read . No cell phone laptop computer allow . Following last ( 10th ) infusion , patient see two week monthly Neurology Pain Clinic follow 3 month . All subject ask wear activity watch time last infusion two week post treatment visit . Patients instruct complete</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients diagnose CRPS base modify IASP ( International Association Study Pain ) research criterion ( Harden RN Bruehl SP Diagnostic Criteria : The Statistical Derivation Four Criterion Factors .

The patient must ketamine naïve either gender include racial minority group . The patient 's age must 18 65 year , inclusive . The study subject must report pain level equal great 4 scale 010 ( 0 = pain 10 = unbearable pain ) . The pain must stable time vary 1 pain level . The patient must stable dose CRPS medication 28 day prior throughout duration study . The patient must accompany responsible adult . The patient instruct he/she allow drive home follow infusion . Therefore order include study subject must arrange transportation 10 day duration study . Patients le 18 year age exclude . In initial study , patient 65 year age exclude due possible unforeseen concomitant medical problem . Patients previously undergone intravenous ketamine infusion exclude study . Patients pregnant , lactating , know psychotic psychiatric illness , afflict glaucoma thyrotoxicosis also exclude . Any patient unable provide consent due cognitive difficulty use study . Patients provide mean transport home follow daily infusion exclude study . The investigator feel issue concern monetary gain loss due patient 's medical condition may adversely affect study , therefore , patient active litigation , compensation disability issue relate CRPS exclude . Patients history substance abuse exclude . Patients certain blood pressure lower medication calcium blocker , beta blocker exclude study . Patients major medical problem include limit ; uncontrolled hypertension , hypotension , cardiac failure , renal failure liver failure use study .</criteria>
