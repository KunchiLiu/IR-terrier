	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Trabectedin Treatment Localized Myxoid / Round Cell Liposarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , prospective ( study follow participant forward time ) , multicenter ( one hospital medical school team work medical research study ) study trabectedin treatment localize myxoid / round cell liposarcoma ( MRCL ) . Trabectedin give 1.5 milligram per meter square ( mg/m^2 ) 24-hour intravenous ( iv ) infusion every 3 week minimum 3 maximum 6 cycle along dexamethasone 20 mg iv give within 30 minute start trabectedin iv infusion . Participants whose myxoid/round cell liposarcoma ( MRCL ) progress end neoadjuvant treatment follow every 6 week disease progression 6 month post definitive surgery , absence unacceptable toxicity and/or disease progression . Efficacy assess determine pathologic Complete Response ( pCR ) rate assess tumor surgical specimen central pathology review . Participants ' safety monitor throughout trial .</detailed_description>
