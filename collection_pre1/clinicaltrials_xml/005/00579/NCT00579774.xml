	<brief_summary>Advanced glycation product AGEs heterogeneous group molecule form exposure tissue constituent high level reduce sugar , e.g . glucose . The interaction compound extra- intra-cellular component may account part several condition relate age . It recently recognize AGEs also form preparation food heating , absorb circulation become largely incorporated tissue component . Accumulation exogenous substance time may , together generate endogenously , contribute clinical manifestation complication age . This interventional-randomized study try determine whether diet low AGE effectively reduce circulate AGE level , without alter oxidation inflammatory marker , subset young old subject , period 4 month . If positive result obtain , longer-term prospective study design determine intervention affect disease outcome old age subject . The study design simple consist initially obtaining dietary history , blood sample , 24-hour urine collection , subsequently , determine effect low-AGE diet 4 month plasma level compound group healthy subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Advancing age know associate increase oxidant stress ( OS ) , increase prevalence cardiovascular disease , impair glucose tolerance , diabetes mellitus , decline renal function , accumulation advance glycation end product ( AGEs ) . AGEs lead activation transcriptional pathway , excessive proliferative/growth-related phenomenon sustain inflammation different mechanism may contribute significantly clinical complication age . Recently , become clear major source AGE precursor OS Western diet . The body turnover AGEs involve specific receptor also dependent renal function . While experimental work link AGE-mediated OS chronic complication age animal , human study strikingly lack . We plan test follow two hypothesis : 1 ) old men woman ( age &gt; 60 year ) consume standard diet ( usually high AGE content ) high serum level AGEs conjunction high marker OS , vascular dysfunction inflammation compare young subject ( age &lt; 35 &gt; 18 year ) , 2 ) dietary AGE restriction reduce serum level AGE , marker OS , vascular dysfunction inflammation attenuate difference old young group . Specific aim : To determine effect dietary AGE modification 4 month circulate level AGEs , marker oxidative stress , vascular dysfunction , inflammatory mediator AGE-receptor mechanism PBMN old young subject . This randomize study ( Study 2 ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Adult subject gender race age 18 35 old 60 year Diagnosis diabetes ( absence diabetes define negative history diabetes combination HgbA1c &lt; 6 % time recruitment ) Any major cardiovascular event ( myocardial infarction , stroke , PTCA coronary artery bypass ) within precede 3 month Smokers Glucocorticoid , anticoagulant ( except aspirin ) antioxidant therapy Serum creatinine great 2 mg/dl Inability understand unwillingness follow study diet Any severe illness expect patient survival less 1 year Patients initiate therapy ACE inhibitor , lipid lower medication hormone replacement within previous 3 month . Patients stable dos medication include Before randomization subject screen 3day food record determine average spontaneous daily intake AGEs . Only subject whose daily intake upper half normal ( great 14 AGE Eq/day ) participate study . This value 14 E/day corresponds median daily AGE intake estimate large number healthy subject .</criteria>
