	<brief_summary>Congenital heart disease one common malformation newborn . About 1 % newborns cardiac malformation . Many need open heart surgery , contribute substantially pediatric mortality morbidity . Recent advance genetics suggest many congenital heart defect cause mutation gene . So far , half dozen gene find associate congenital heart disease , TBX5 , NKX2.5 , GATA4 , name . In near future , gene identify . This study evaluate role mutation gene congenital heart diseases study genotype-phenotype correlation . The central hypothesis significant percentage congenital heart disease cause mutation gene involve heart development , phenotype missensed mutation milder nonsense mutation . Another hypothesis significant proportion patient cardiac malformation mutation gene . The specific aim test mutation gene patient congenital heart disease . The study provide substantial information understand human heart develop . In future , prenatal diagnosis could develop base study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : The purpose study evaluate role mutation gene congenital heart diseases study genotype-phenotype correlation . Hypothesis : The central hypothesis significant percentage congenital heart disease cause mutation gene involve heart development , phenotype missensed mutation milder nonsense mutation . Another hypothesis significant proportion patient cardiac malformation mutation gene . The specific aim test mutation gene patient congenital heart disease . Study Design Procedures : This pilot study mutation gene congenital heart diseases genotype-phenotype correlation . Probands family member initially evaluate local physician UCI Medical Center . A clinical diagnosis make base clinical information , echocardiography , EKG , and/or cardiac catheteration . We would like correlate mutation specific type congenital heart defect . For example , mutation TBX5 likely cause atrial-septal defect , ventricular-septal defect ; mutation PTPN11 likely cause pulmonary stenosis .</detailed_description>
