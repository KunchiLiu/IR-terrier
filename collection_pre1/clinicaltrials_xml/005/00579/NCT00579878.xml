	<brief_title>Triple III Comparison Leflunomide Alone Versus Two DMARD Combinations Treatment Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : The combination methotrexate-sulfasalazine-hydroxychloroquine show effective methotrexate alone double combination methotrexate-sulfasalazine methotrexate-hydroxychloroquine . The objective study look safety efficacy new DMARD , leflunomide , alone combination traditional DMARDs ( sulfasalazine hydroxychloroquine ) . Research Design : This protocol design 48 week , double blind , randomize , prospective control . A total 180 subject enrol , randomly assign one three study arm ( 60 subject arm ) : 1 ) leflunomide alone ; 2 ) leflunomide-sulfasalazine-hydroxychloroquine ; 3 ) methotrexate-sulfasalazine-hydroxychloroquine . All subject receive identical number medication combination active drug placebo . Patients stratify two group : methotrexate-naïve ( history methotrexate ) ; methotrexate-failure ( failed achieve clinical response top dose 20 mg/week least 8 week ) . Methotrexate-naïve patient start study 10 mg/week methotrexate possible increase next evaluation dependent remission criterion . Methotrexate-failure patient start study top study dose 20 mg/week remain dose entire study . Methodology : All patient recruit outpatient academic , private practice , VA rheumatology clinic . Subjects age 19 80 year . No pediatric subject enrol . No enrollment restriction base race , ethnic origin gender . Inclusion criterion include : formal diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis per ACR criterion ; disease duration &gt; 6 month ; least 6 swollen 6 tender joint examination ; negative urine pregnancy test premenopausal female . Specific exclusion criterion include : previous treatment leflunomide combination DMARDs ; abnormal lab value ; history allergy sulfa , aspirin tartrazine ; significant comorbid disease ; unwillingness avoid alcohol . Study subject return evaluation every 8 week . All patient monitor efficacy sign drug toxicity throughout study laboratory examination ( CBC platelet , AST ALT , albumin , creatinine , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ) , hand x-ray , retinal examination , chest x-ray ( indicate ) . Every six month subject ask complete ClinHAQ SF36 questionnaire , design evaluate effect RA daily live ( ADLs ) . Subjects withdraw study : due pregnancy ; serious adverse event alleviate symptomatic treatment ; recurrent toxicity reappears treatment drug suspension ; lack efficacy ( 20 % improvement week 32 ) ; non-compliance protocol ; withdrawal consent . The primary study outcome measure plan data collection begin . Clinical Relationship : Rheumatoid arthritis chronic disease affect large proportion population . It produce significant morbidity may result premature mortality . The majority patient RA remain disease-modifying agent less two year toxicity lack efficacy . Because failure standard therapy consistently halt slow progression disease incidence side effect , new approach clearly need .</detailed_description>
