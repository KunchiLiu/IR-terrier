	<detailed_description>The development type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) represent complex series event , involve abnormality adipose tissue lipid distribution insulin action . Along increase adipose tissue mass increase inflammation bring macrophage infiltrate adipose tissue . These macrophage express inflammatory cytokine TNF- IL-6 , correlate insulin resistance metabolic syndrome , suggest metabolic syndrome diabetes condition characterize state chronic , low-grade inflammation . Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) improve insulin sensitivity via activation PPAR- , much evidence PPAR agonist also anti-inflammatory property . Fish oil rich source Omega-3 fatty acid large literature potential benefit fish oil lower serum triglyceride , cardiovascular protection , immune modulation , evidence fish oil also activate PPAR . Hence , focus study subject insulin resistance metabolic syndrome , yet diabetes . We plan treat insulin resistant subject fish oil ask follow question . Hypothesis 1 . The treatment insulin resistant subject fish oil reduce adipose tissue inflammation . Aim 1 . From blood sample draw treatment , measure level circulate inflammatory cytokine . Aim 2 . Adipose tissue biopsy perform fish oil treatment . From adipose biopsy , quantitate cytokine expression , macrophage number , look evidence macrophage apoptosis . Aim 3 . We determine whether fish oil treatment increase adipose tissue secretion serum level high molecular weight form adiponectin . Hypothesis 2 . The reduction inflammatory marker occur activation PPAR fish oil . Aim 4 . Adipose tissue macrophage treat vitro fish oil presence absence PPAR inhibitor . We determine whether fish oil stimulate secretion high molecular weight adiponectin isoform adipose tissue whether induce apoptosis macrophage , whether process inhibit PPAR inhibitor . Hypothesis 3 . Fish oil improve peripheral insulin sensitivity reduction intramyocellular lipid , improvement muscle insulin signal transduction . Aim 5 . Before treatment fish oil , insulin sensitivity measure , along intramyocellular lipid gene involve insulin action muscle lipid oxidation .</detailed_description>
