	<brief_title>Comparison Latanoprost Vs. Timolol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A recent publication laboratory show patient ocular hypertension ( OHT ) reduce uveoscleral outflow reduce trabecular outflow facility compare healthy age-matched control . These change cause elevate intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . Aqueous flow rate change patient . It logical assume would efficacious treat OHT patient drug reduce IOP increase uveoscleral outflow ( abnormally low ) drug reduce aqueous flow ( normal OHT ) . The primary purpose study show , control mask clinical study OHT patient , latanoprost increase low uveoscleral drainage aqueous humor ( Fu ) back normal level , timolol maleate reduces formation aqueous humor ( Fa ) normal . Both mechanism effectively reduce IOP . The secondary purpose ass effect latanoprost timolol maleate fluorophotometric outflow facility ( Cflu ) , episcleral venous pressure ( Pev ) parameter time . Subjects eligible participate least 19 year age diagnose bilateral ocular hypertension primary open angle glaucoma intraocular pressure 20 35 mmHg eye Day 0 . Subjects treat either latanoprost timolol 6 week crossover treat similarly alternate drug additional 6 week . There screen visit total 6 study visit aqueous humor flow , uveoscleral outflow , fluorophotometric outflow facility determine use instrument call fluorophotometer . The fluorophotometer scan eye fluorescein dye allow investigator measure calculate variable . There 7 scan take study day additionally IOP measure completion scan . An Exit exam perform time exit ensure ocular health subject . Subjects monitor adverse event throughout course study subject may discontinue study time reason , may discontinue , opinion investigator , risk subject .</detailed_description>
