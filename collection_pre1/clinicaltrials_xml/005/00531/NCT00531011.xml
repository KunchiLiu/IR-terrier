	<brief_title>EXecutive RCT : Evaluating XIENCE V® Multi Vessel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical evaluation XIENCE V® everolimus elute coronary stent system revascularization treatment patient multi-vessel coronary artery disease ( MVD-CAD ) . The long term safety efficacy XIENCE V EECSS demonstrate SPIRIT FIRST trial 5 year , SPIRIT II trial 4 year , SPIRIT III Randomized Control Trial ( RCT ) 3 year . In addition , pre-approval study show low rate Target Vessel Failure Major Adverse Cardiac Events ( MACE ) consistently low comparator arm study . The post approval EXECUTIVE study demonstrate use XIENCE EECSS complex lesion real-world population result 1 year MACE , Stent Thrombosis Target Lesion Revascularization rate comparable previously mention pre-approval study include patient restrict inclusion / exclusion criterion . Therefore , base exist data trial , Abbott Vascular decide discontinue follow EXECUTIVE trial . The study compose two part : A Registry , outline separate post Randomized Control Trial ( RCT ) portion study , follow : -A randomize group patient aim assess angiographic efficacy XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System ( XIENCE V® EECSS ) compare TAXUS® Liberté™ Paclitaxel Eluting Coronary Stent System .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient must least 18 year age 2 . Patient able verbally confirm understand risk , benefit treatment alternative receive XIENCE V® EECSS he/she his/her legally authorize representative provide write informed consent prior study related procedure , approve appropriate Medical Ethics Committee respective clinical site 3 . Patient diagnose MVD , document coronary angiography , i.e . present severe stenosis ( &gt; 50 % ) amenable PCI least 2 major epicardial vessel principal bifurcation branch ( diagonal obtuse marginal ) 4 . Patient must evidence myocardial ischemia ( e.g. , stable unstable angina , silent ischemia , positive functional study reversible change electrocardiogram ECG consistent ischemia ) 5 . Patient must acceptable candidate coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery 6 . Patient must agree undergo protocolrequired followup examination . Angiographic Inclusion Criteria 1 . Patients may receive 4 plan XIENCE V® EECSS stent , depend number vessel treat respective lesion length . When multiple lesion present one main coronary branch , complete revascularization attempt implantation maximum 4 plan stent 2 . Target lesion must de novo lesion ( prior stent implant , prior brachytherapy ) 3 . Target vessel reference diameter must 2.5 mm 4.0 mm visual estimate 4 . Target lesion &lt; = 28 mm length visual estimation 5 . Target lesion must major artery principal branch ( diagonal obtuse marginal ) visually estimate stenosis &gt; = 50 % 6 . Two lesion single main coronary artery branch constitute MVD situation , therefore type patient must enrol 1 . Patient known diagnosis acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) within 72 hour precede index procedure ( nonprocedural/spontaneous MI , CKMB &gt; = 2 time upper limit normal ) CK CKMB return within normal limit time procedure 2 . Patient current unstable arrhythmia 3 . Patient know leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 30 % 4 . Patient receive heart transplant organ transplant wait list organ transplant 5 . Patient receive schedule receive chemotherapy radiation therapy within 30 day prior procedure . 6 . Patient receive immunosuppression therapy know immunosuppressive autoimmune disease ( e.g . human immunodeficiency virus , systemic lupus erythematosus etc . ) 7 . Patient receive chronic anticoagulation therapy ( e.g . coumadin ) 8 . Patient known hypersensitivity contraindication aspirin , paclitaxel , either heparin bivalirudin , clopidogrel ticlopidine , everolimus , cobalt , chromium , nickel , tungsten , acrylic fluoro polymer contrast sensitivity adequately premedicated 9 . Elective surgery plan within first 9 month ( +/ 14 day ) procedure require discontinue either aspirin clopidogrel 10 . Patient platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3 , WBC &lt; 3,000 cells/mm3 , document suspect liver disease ( include laboratory evidence hepatitis ) 11 .

Patient medical illness ( e.g. , cancer congestive heart failure ) know history substance abuse ( alcohol , cocaine , heroin etc . ) may cause noncompliance protocol , confound data interpretation associate limited life expectancy ( i.e . less one year ) 16 . Patient already participate another investigational use device drug study complete followup phase another study within last 30 day . Angiographic Exclusion Criteria 1 . Target lesion meet follow criterion : Left main location Located within arterial saphenous vein graft distal diseased arterial saphenous vein graft ( defined vessel irregularity per angiogram &gt; 20 % stenosed lesion visual estimation ) Heavy calcification 2 . The patient may need 4 planned stent . Bailout stent allow must type randomization stent .</criteria>
