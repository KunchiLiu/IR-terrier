	<brief_title>Evaluation Emission Distance P. Aeruginosa From Respiratory Tract People With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) represent frequent genetic disorder autosomal recessive transmission negative prognosis Caucasian population , incidence 1 3000 . CF multisystemic disease involve exocrine function , particular , respiratory tract gastroenteric system . The mutated gene cause alteration transportation chloride sodium lead production denser bronchial secretion , favour onset chronic respiratory infection , inflammation respiratory insufficiency . Indeed , pulmonary infection one primary characteristic , well main cause morbidity mortality CF . There association acquisition respiratory pathogen ( mainly B. cepacia complex [ BCC ] P. aeruginosa [ PA ] ) worsen parameter respiratory function lower survival rate . Recent epidemiological data show 57.3 % CF patient pulmonary infection cause PA . Therefore , prevent clinical consequence derive chronic colonization PA , avoid contact infect patient possible fundamental importance . The mean patient come contact pathogen still entirely clear ; nevertheless , believe transmission occur direct contact droplet , indirect contact inert surface use common colonized non-colonized patient , reservoir surface care environment . Droplets define large drop ( &gt; 5 micron ) produce cough , sneeze speaking , implement certain procedure aspiration broncoscopy . As indirect mean transmission , demonstrate pathogens high survival rate inert surface : example , PA suspend physiological solution survive dry surface 24 hour patient expectoration 8 day . If expel cough sneeze CF patient 's respiratory tract , therefore , PA BCC [ 20 ] linger surface health care centre long time , later enter contact respiratory mucosa CF patient attend centre , contact patient ' hand contaminate surface . Only limited number study evaluate prevalence pathogen non-critical surface CF centre . In one recent study research group evaluate 4-year period prevalence pathogenic micro-organisms CF specimens take non-critical surface sink out-patient clinic dedicate exclusively care CF patient , aim improve prevention cross-infections CF centre . As direct transmission PA , various international prevention guideline . All guideline include recommendation CF patient maintain minimum distance 1 meter one another . A recent study demonstrate theoretical possibility airborne PA transmission . Specific Aims Rationale According international guideline control prevent infection CF patient , necessary maintain minimum distance 1 meter CF patient order avoid transmission PA BCC clinical consequence chronic infection pathogen . This indication derive similar recommendation contain CDC Guidelines hospital isolation precaution relative infectious disease transmit droplet . It base theoretical assumption , besides transmission direct contact , transmission PA take place prevalently droplets . There two study distance reach PA emit respiratory tract CF patient . The first study [ 18 ] examine PA emission CF patient ' coughing , make cough onto dish hold patient , onto plate hold distance meter . In second study six PA-colonized patient cough direction soap bubble holder hold distance 10 cm , 20 cm , 30 cm , 40 cm 50 cm mouth . The result obtain two study show possibility transmit PA cough distance least one meter , possibility emit PA distance great 40 cm . However , study provide proof one meter effective indicator distance necessary preventing PA emit one patient reach another . It appear study ever investigate PA expel carrier 's respiratory tract cough distance great recommend one meter `` safety distance '' CF patient , study do maximum distance PA emit normal conversation reach . In case , aside distance PA actually reach ; study effectiveness 1-meter distance CF patient measure prevent PA cross-infections . Since data available far PA emit respiratory tract colonize CF patient cough reach data relative simple conversation , recommendation one-meter distance seem back sufficient evidence . In word , one meter may great enough distance prevent potential risk transmission ; therefore , recommendation maintain minimum distance one meter may inadequate . Our study thus intend contribute fill knowledge gap regard , clarify validity minimum distance one meter prevention measure transmission PA one CF patient another . The objective study : - To evaluate distance reach PA expel emission droplet respiratory tract CF patient simple conversation cough . - To verify 1-meter distance patient colonize PA actually effective prevention measure regard PA infection , report International Guidelines . Experimental study check convenience sample . This study evaluate distance reach Pseudomonas aeruginosa normal conversation cough CF patient . With aim , evaluate presence PA surface 4 different distance patient , culture 8 swab take surface , 4 normal conversation 4 others cough . Data collection At time inclusion study follow data collect : Patient name surname , age month , Rx score , FEV1 , BMI , Micro-organisms present previous current expectorate culture , PCR . After collect specimen prepare culture plate , PA growth medium correspond various collection distance observe . The result laboratory analysis report patient 's file , thus : Presence Pseudomonas Aeruginosa - conversation : 0 - 0.5 ; 0.5 - 1.00 ; 1.00 - 1.5 ; 1.50 - 2.00 m. - coughing : 0 - 0.5 ; 0.5 - 1.00 ; 1.00 - 1.5 ; 1.50 - 2.00 m. Safety measure Personnel wear single-use glove coat . Data management statistical analysis The data enter Microsoft Access 2000 database . For four distance two mode ( cough conversation ) percentage PA presence determine confidence interval define 95 % percentage . Moreover , look association presence/absence PA distance mode , clinical variable patient . For qualitative variable statistical analysis make Chi-square test . For quantitative variable statistical analysis do Student 's T-distribution . Expected Results : We expect obtain estimate proportion contaminate area estimate CF patient risk reach secretion expel respiratory tract CF patient different distance . Clinical protocol Recruitment : Upon patient receive check-up CF Centre , researcher decide , basis demographic microbiology , patient include study group . If patient reach age 14 last microbiological culture expectorate positive PA , patient ask ( parent , age ) participate study give background information . After question answer , patient decides participate write consent take ( co-signed parent , age ) . Subsequently , patient 's entry data take filling patient questionnaire , specimen collect . The study call assignment therapeutic strategy ; clinical laboratory data relative patient participate study obtain routine follow-up , without modify current clinical practice . Specimen collection method To collect specimen , special rule table ( 0.5 X 2.10 ) set cover single-use waterproof surgical cloth patient enlist study . The patient ask place front table 0 point . The table regulate accord patient 's height , level navel . Then patient ask read text place front loud , order recreate normal conversation . We proceed take specimen 4 sterile swab , one use collect specimen table surface subdivide following distance : 0 - 0.5 ; 0.5 - 1.00 ; 1.00 - 1.5 ; 1.50 - 2.00 m. Specimen collection sterile swab surface sterile cloth do rub entirely four surface sterile cloth subdivide entirely , use boustrophedonic movement . After first set collect , single-use cloth substitute order restore sterile condition . Next , patient ask perform two FET sequence consist give one two forced expiration glottis open , start medium-low lung volume , follow rest period diaphragm breathe maintain . At point collection next 4 specimen take method describe .</detailed_description>
