	<brief_summary>Inflammation clearly contribute progression cystic fibrosis ( CF ) lung disease , administration anti-inflammatory agent high-dose ibuprofen retard rate decline pulmonary function . However , utilization valuable drug suboptimal rare , dramatic , adverse effect . Therefore , alternative anti-inflammatory agent urgently need . One strategy identify new anti-inflammatory agent determine mechanism proven anti-inflammatory agent CF lung disease , high-dose ibuprofen , exerts effect . If know , drug act similar mechanism become candidate treat CF inflammatory disease . The investigator show , preliminary study , high dose ibuprofen limit delivery neutrophils inflame mucosal surface , gingival crevice . The investigator plan test pioglitazone simvastatin , ( ibuprofen ( positive control ) ) determine anti inflammatory affect neutrophil migration oral mucosa . The hypothesis test pioglitazone , and/or simvastatin reduce neutrophils oral mucosa 10 day therapy mouthwashes healthy volunteer . Ibuprofen use positive control . This study provide pilot data healthy volunteer support FDA Grant submit future date .</brief_summary>

The two treatment group consist 4 healthy volunteer meet inclusion criterion . There 2 healthy volunteer positive control group . Group 1 receive pioglitazone 30 mg daily , Group 2 receive simvastatin 40 mg daily Group 3 positive control receive ibuprofen ( 15-23 mg/kg twice daily , maximum 3200 mg/day ) Treatment period serve positive control group . This dose 25 % prescribed CF patient . As healthy volunteer recruit , first assign Group 1 , second Group 2 , . After third subject assign Group 3 , pattern assignment repeat subject 4 , 5 6 , The follow 4 healthy volunteer assign group 1 2 ( 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ) .</detailed_description>
