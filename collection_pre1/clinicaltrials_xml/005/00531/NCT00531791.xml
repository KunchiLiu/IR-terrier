	<brief_summary>Short course steroid COPD exacerbation improve FEV1 decrease relapse rate . However , concern remain use systemic steroid patient acute exacerbation . Their short-term advantage may outweigh occurrence adverse side effect hyperglycemia , difficult manage outpatient basis . In context , possibility treat patient COPD exacerbation inhale steroid less systemic adverse effect interest . The objective compare relapse rate , lung function , severity dyspnea , systemic sputum inflammatory marker outpatient acute COPD exacerbation treat fluticasone/salmeterol ( Advair® ) oral prednisone 10 day . The hypothesis Advair® effective prednisone treatment outpatient COPD exacerbation . The primary endpoint determine relapse rate one month equivalent treatment . The secondary endpoint compare lung function dyspnea score , systemic sputum inflammatory marker modulation 10 day treatment . We recruit 30 outpatient group COPD clinic . Patients receive prednisone ( 40mg/day ) placebo diskus Advair® 50/500ug 2 inhalation bid ( twice regular dose ) placebo pill 10 day . All patient receive antibiotic short-acting bronchodilator need . We expect demonstrate improvement lung function , dyspnea , inflammatory marker relapse rate equivalent treatment suggest Advair® could good alternative prednisone patient steroid-induced hyperglycemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Advair® Outpatients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Acute Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD exacerbation common cause ill health , hospitalization death . Once exacerbation symptom recognize , current treatment consist short course oral steroid , antibiotic increase bronchodilator intake . Systemic steroid think reduce inflammatory component COPD exacerbation . A short course steroid therapy improve FEV1 decrease relapse rate study do patient require hospitalization . Only study describe role steroid outpatient set . However , concern remain use systemic steroid patient acute exacerbation . Their short-term advantage may outweigh occurrence adverse side effect hyperglycemia , difficult manage outpatient basis . In context , possibility treat patient COPD exacerbation inhale steroid less systemic adverse effect interest . In clinical trial , combination corticosteroid long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist ( LABA ) reduce airway inflammation , exacerbation rate , improve lung function health status patient stable moderate severe COPD beyond achieve individual component therapy . Trials show nebulized steroid acute COPD exacerbation require hospitalization effective prednisone less hyperglycemia . To knowledge , study conduct efficacy combination treatment inhale steroid LABA outpatient management COPD exacerbation . Combination treatment could good alternative patient steroid contraindication reduce hospitalisation uncontrolled hyperglycemia . Primary objective : To compare relapse rate , lung function , severity dyspnea , systemic sputum inflammatory marker outpatient acute exacerbation COPD treat twice regular dosage Advair® oral prednisone 10 day . Secondary objective : To obtain preliminary data allow sample size calculation large similar clinical trial . Hypothesis : Advair® effective oral prednisone treatment outpatient acute COPD exacerbation . Airway inflammation component pathophysiology COPD exacerbation . Sputum COPD-exacerbation patient elevate inflammatory cell , TNF , IL-8 RANTES level compare stable patient . Systemic steroid think reduce inflammatory component COPD exacerbation . Appraisal current literature glucocorticosteroids acute COPD exacerbation show short course systemic corticosteroid therapy improve spirometry decrease relapse rate study use steroid exacerbation do patient require hospitalization , describe role steroid outpatient set . Two randomize control trial study patient acute COPD exacerbation require hospitalization . Patients assign receive oral prednisone least 9 day placebo . The prednisone group show rapid significant improvement force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) . This therapy also result few treatment failure trend toward rapid improvement dyspnea scale score compare placebo . However , despite proof efficacy , concern remain use systemic corticosteroid patient acute exacerbation . Mainly short-term advantage may outweigh occurrence adverse side effect hyperglycemia , difficult manage outpatient basis myopathy observe even follow single oral dose prednisolone . In context , possibility treat patient acute COPD exacerbation inhale corticosteroid less systemic adverse effect particular interest . Two trial study effect nebulized steroid acute COPD exacerbation require hospitalization . Maltais et al . show 3 day oral prednisone nebulized budesonide significantly increase FEV1 compare placebo . Compared prednisone , nebulized budesonide associate less occurrence hyperglycemia , potential advantage diabetic patient COPD . Recent study suggest long-acting b2-agonist potential option treatment acute exacerbation COPD . It show salmeterol ( 100 mcg ) formoterol ( 48mcg ) give interval time induced effective dose-dependent increase FEV1 , FVC IC patient mild acute COPD exacerbation . Finally , inhaled combination salmeterol/fluticasone 13 week stable COPD patient show significant decrease airway inflammation decrease lymphocytes , neutrophil , eosinophils cell express gene TNF IFN . The main effect inhale corticosteroid think mediate suppression airway inflammation , LABA think work induce bronchodilation . However , emerge data indicate long-acting b2-adrenoceptor agonist may amplify anti-inflammatory effect corticosteroid accelerate nuclear translocation glucocorticoid receptor complex , enhance transcription expression steroid-inducible gene pro-inflammatory cell . These result suggest role combination long-acting b2-adrenoreceptor agonist inhale steroid inflammation observe acute COPD exacerbation .</detailed_description>
