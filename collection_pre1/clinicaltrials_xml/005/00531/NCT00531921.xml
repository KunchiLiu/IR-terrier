	<detailed_description>Inflammation injury transplant organ immediate post-operative period may link early organ dysfunction high rate transplant rejection recipient . Currently , mRNA expression proinflammatory gene donor tissue think risk factor early organ transplant dysfunction , increased expression recipient cell-mediated immunity gene , organ rejection . The purpose study test association proinflammatory mRNA expression donor sample subsequent development early organ dysfunction kidney , lung , liver transplant recipient . This study also test effect proinflammatory mediator express transplanted organ pre- post-reperfusion organ rejection gene express cell mediate immune response . This achieve identifying proinflammatory immune response mechanisms . This study consist 11 study visit period 2 year . The baseline visit occur 24 hour prior organ transplantation . Follow-up visit occur daily Days 1 3 ( lung transplant recipient ) Day 7 , Week 6 , Months 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 post-transplant . At baseline visit , physical exam , medical history , demographic , vital sign measurement , blood collection , collection donor tissue sample occur . For study visit , medication adverse event track blood collection occur . Depending transplant type , participant undergo follow procedure : - Heart : Participants undergo heart biopsy part standard clinical care follow heart transplant . An echocardiogram electrocardiogram occur visit . - Kidney : Renal biopsy perform 1 hour reperfusion time surgery . Urine collection occur visit . - Liver : Liver biopsy perform time procurement within 1 hour reperfusion . - Lung : Participants undergo bronchoalveolar lavage part standard clinical care follow lung transplant . A chest x-ray , arterial blood gas test , pulmonary function test , 6-minute walk test occur visit .</detailed_description>
