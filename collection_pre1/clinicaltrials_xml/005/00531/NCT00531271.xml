	<criteria>Phase I Study Each subject must meet follow criterion enrol study . 1 . Pathologically confirm adenocarcinoma breast metastasis . 2 . No 2 prior chemotherapy regimen metastatic breast cancer . Patient receive anthracycline may receive taxane within 6 month registration study . 3 . Patient may measurable evaluable disease . 4 . Patient may nonmeasurable bone disease . 5 . At least 4 week since prior cytotoxic chemotherapy . Patients recover acute effect therapy . 6 . At least 4 week since radiotherapy , full recovery . 7 . At least 4 week since recovery major surgery , full recovery . 8 . ECOG performance status 02 . 9 . Age ≥18 year . 10 . Patient must follow blood count Baseline : WBC &gt; 3.0 x 109 cells/L ; ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109 cells/L ; Platelets ≥ 100 x 109 cells/L ; Hgb ≥ 9 grams/dL . 11 . Patient follow blood chemistry level Baseline : AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 1.5x upper limit normal range ( ULN ) ; Total Bilirubin &lt; ULN ; Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5x ULN ( unless bone metastasis present absence liver metastasis ) ; Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL . 12 . Peripheral neuropathy Grade 0 stable Grade 1 , National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) v3.0 . 13 . If female childbearing potential , serum pregnancy test negative ( within 72 hour first dose study drug ) . 14 . If fertile , patient agrees use effective method avoid pregnancy duration study . 15 . Life expectancy ≥ 3 month . 16 . Informed consent document obtain state patient understands investigational nature propose treatment . 17 . If obese , patient must treat dos calculate use his/her actual body surface area ( BSA ) ( physician must comfortable treat full BSA dose regardless BSA ) . Phase II Study 1 . Pathologically confirm adenocarcinoma breast metastasis . 2 . Patients receive prior chemotherapy metastatic disease . If taxane use adjuvant neoadjuvant therapy , least 12 month elapse date last dose . 3 . Patient must least one measurable metastatic lesion . 4 . At least 4 week since prior cytotoxic chemotherapy . Patients recover acute effect therapy . 5 . At least 4 week since radiotherapy , full recovery . 6 . At least 4 week since major surgery , full recovery . 7 . ECOG performance status 02 . 8 .

Informed consent document obtain state patient understands investigational nature propose treatment . Phase I Study Subjects meet follow criterion exclude study . 1 . Concurrent therapy ( chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , kinase inhibitor , immunotherapy , etc ) breast cancer . Bisphosphonates allow . 2 . Parenchymal brain metastasis , unless document clinically radiographically stable least 6 month treatment . 3 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 4 . Patients significant cardiovascular disease include congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Class III IV ) , active angina pectoris recent myocardial infarction ( within last 6 month ) . 5 . History malignancy within last 5 year could affect diagnosis assessment breast cancer exclude nonmelanomatous skin cancer cervical carcinoma situ . 6 . Patients receive investigational drug within previous 4 week . 7 . Patient currently enrol clinical study investigational procedure perform investigational therapy administer . A patient may enroll clinical trial participate study . 8 . Pregnant nursing woman . 9 . Patients history allergic reaction attribute solventbased docetaxel ( Taxotere ) . 10 . ECOG performance status 34 . 11 . Because patient immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction docetaxel . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Phase II Study Subjects meet follow criterion exclude study . 1 . Prior neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy allow . If taxane part adjuvant regimen , least 12 month transpire since completion taxane regimen . 2 . Concurrent therapy ( chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , kinase inhibitor , immunotherapy , etc ) breast cancer . 3 . Parenchymal brain metastasis , unless document clinically radiographically stable least 6 month treatment . 4 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 5 .

History malignancy within last 5 year could affect diagnosis assessment breast cancer exclude nonmelanomatous skin cancer cervical carcinoma situ . 7 . Patients receive investigational drug within previous 4weeks . 8 . Patient currently enrol clinical study investigational procedure perform investigational therapy administer . 9 . Pregnant nursing woman . 10 . Patients history allergic reaction attribute solventbased docetaxel ( Taxotere ) . 11 . ECOG performance status 34 . 12 . Because patient immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction docetaxel . 13 .
