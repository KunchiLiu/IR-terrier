	<brief_summary>This study determine dietary supplement sitosterol ( plant cholesterol commonly find vegetable ) modify blood sugar cholesterol level reduce stiffness blood vessel people abnormal copy gene cause sitosterolemia . People carry one copy abnormal gene healthy increase blood level sitosterol . People two abnormal copy gene increase level sitosterol increase risk heart attack . This condition call sitosterolemia . Although extremely rare general population , 4 % Amish carry abnormal copy gene . People Amish background 18 year age old one person carry one copy abnormal gene cause sitosterolemia abnormal gene may eligible study . Subjects must sex within 5 year age . During two period one month participant receive pill contain sitosterol special diet meal supplement change level sitosterol diet . During one two study period , subject receive sitosterol supplement pills one month 10 day diet . At end study period , subject come NIH Clinical Center one day follow test : - Measurements height , weight , blood pressure heart rate . - Adipose ( fat ) tissue biopsy . A small piece fat skin abdomen remove examine sitosterol affect fat tissue ability process sugar fat . - Indirect calorimetry . A plastic transparent hood place subject head collect air breathe one-half hour study body use sugar generate energy . - Endothelial vascular function . An ultrasound picture blood vessel forearm take blood pressure cuff inflate around arm measure vessel ability stretch . - Intravenous glucose tolerance test : A small plastic tube place vein arm . Then one minute subject receive glucose one tube . Twenty minute later subject give small amount insulin tube . Blood sample draw tube arm frequent interval 3 hour . This test measure sitosterol affect body process sugar . - DEXA scan . The subject lie x-ray table 20 minute scan , measure total body fat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Dietary Sitosterol Blood Sugar Cholesterol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The relative distribution various amount lipid membrane adipocytes play important role lipid metabolism energy homeostasis . Sitosterolemia , rare genetic disease cause defective ABC transporter gut biliary tract , result increase absorption decrease excretion plant sterol , ultimately lead accelerate atherosclerosis premature death . Very recently , mutation ABCG8 gene , rare general population , describe 4 % Old Order Amish , well-characterized founder population Lancaster County , Pennsylvania . Preliminary data indicate otherwise healthy carrier ( heterozygote ) mutation show , compare control , reduce body mass index , large buoyant LDL cholesterol , decrease carotid intima medium thickness ( IMT ) , trend toward low insulin glucose level , consistent improve metabolic syndrome profile . These data suggest mild excess plant sterol could play role modulation energy metabolism , dietary sitosterol may improve lipid profile aspects metabolic syndrome genetically normal subject . In order characterize mechanistically effect sitosterol , abundant plant sterol diet , development metabolic syndrome , propose study great detail carrier ABCG8 gene mutation ; provide opportunity analyze new insight dietary sitosterol role lipid energy metabolism . We hypothesize sitosterol diet affect metabolic syndrome index differentially carrier mutation compare non-carriers . We perform nutrigenomics intervention 15 ABCG8 mutation carrier sex-matched unaffected person ( age +/- 5 year ) . They treat high- , low- sitosterol iso-caloric diet . Study subject evaluate NIH Clinical Center change follow parameter : circulate lipid free fatty acid , glucose disposal , rest energy expenditure RQ , endothelial vascular function . The Division Endocrinology , Diabetes Nutrition University Of Maryland School Medicine carry genotyping , study volunteer recruitment , cell membrane lipid content analysis , ex-vivo adipocyte analysis . We hypothesize carrier ABCG8 gene mutation improve metabolic syndrome index challenge high-sitosterol diet , regress toward non-carrier control treat low-sitosterol diet . Non-carrier control remain unchanged show modest improvement metabolic syndrome index challenge high-sitosterol diet , worsen , compare baseline carrier sib , treat low-sitosterol diet . These clinical data , combine vitro analysis effect sitosterol cell membrane adipocyte metabolism advance knowledge field lipid metabolism relation lipid composition common disorder metabolic syndrome . Data obtain project could potentially translate nutritional therapeutic intervention general population .</detailed_description>
