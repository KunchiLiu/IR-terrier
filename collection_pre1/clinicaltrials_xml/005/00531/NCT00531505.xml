	<detailed_description>1 . Briefly describe purpose protocol . First purpose study understand inheritance morbid obesity . If gene gene cause morbid obesity find , diagnosis treatment morbid obesity may improve . Second purpose learn effect weight loss dementia , body composition , comorbidity . 2 . Briefly summarize participant recruit . Volunteers first learn LABS-2a research opportunity Bariatric Surgery Informational meeting . Subjects express interest , screen IRB-approved informal telephone interview . If exclusion criterion identify , volunteer ask provide IRB-approved consent . Recruitment occur irrespective race , religion color . 3 . Briefly describe procedure subject undergo . Participants ask complete set memory test . These memory test record audio tape . BodPod use measure muscle , bone , fat . The BodPod upright capsule enclose around subject completely . BodPod use movement air measure muscle , fat volume . Participation memory test portion BodPod portion research optional . Fat Liver sample remove weight loss surgery , specifically research study . 4 . If applicable , briefly describe survey/interview instrument use . Memory test perform assess cognition . The Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition ( WMS-III ) Mini Memory State Examination ( MMSE ) validate memory test use . The WMS-III test logical memory subject recall short story read . The MMSE involve perform set request test orientation time place , immediate recall , short term verbal memory , calculation , language construct ability . 5 . Briefly describe data analyze address purpose protocol . The memory test data collect compare well establish norm . Tissue sample store repository genetically study indefinite amount time . Genetic study relate disease obesity associate comorbidities bring disease .</detailed_description>
