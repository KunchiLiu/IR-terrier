	<brief_summary>Depression common people experience traumatic brain injury . Few treatment find effective treat depression situation . We intend investigate effectiveness form brain stimulation , transcranial magnetic stimulation , find effective treat depression people undergo brain injury . By evaluate new method treat depression population , hope increase option available treat people difficult situation . Furthermore , problem aspect think also commonly present post brain injury , individual depression . Various brain stimulation technique , include transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) show positive effect cognition . We also intend investigate whether therapeutic effect cognitive deficit present follow TMS , addition effect depression . New treatment protocol develop , understand pathology treatment post traumatic brain injury depression enhance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It plausible propose treatment paradigm may result improvement mood cognition possibility change self reinforce result enhance quality life reduce service demand . The proposal use rTMS treatment post TBI depression also support aetiological model . In particular , rTMS would seem considerable potential improve pathophysiological change relevant treatment post TBI depression cognitive dysfunction . Early model mechanism action rTMS treatment depression base observation rTMS able produce localise change cortical activity [ 7 ] . The standard treatment paradigm generally find produce increase local prefrontal cortical excitability . However , recently increase understanding rTMS modulates distal brain region well potentially strength connection brain region . It propose therapeutic effect non TBI-related depression occur modulation dorsal frontal - subcortical limbic connectivity potentially actual integrity strength connection region . If case , alter cortical - cortical cortical - subcortical connectivity may lead therapeutic benefit post TBI depression due likely involvement white matter change development TBI relate mood disorder . Aims/Objectives/Hypothesis/es Primary Aim : To assess effectiveness rTMS treat depression post traumatic brain injury . Secondary Aim : To gain preliminary data possible effectiveness rTMS treat cognitive deficit post traumatic brain injury . Hypothesis 1 : Active bilateral sequential rTMS lead improvement symptom post TBI depression , measure MADRS score , compare sham treatment Hypothesis 2 : Active bilateral sequential rTMS lead improvement cognitive executive functioning individual post TBI , compare sham treatment Hypothesis 3 : Active bilateral sequential rTMS lead improvement life satisfaction level function individual post TBI , compare sham treatment . Methodology Experimental Design Randomisation Procedures The study design allow report result manner consistent international CONSORT guideline . The study involve 4-week ( 20 session ) randomize double-blind clinical trial 2 treatment arm conduct Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre Melbourne . Randomization occur via generation computer number sequence . Subjects randomize immediately prior commencement first treatment session , measurement bilateral rest motor threshold standard mean . The main study phase ( phase 1 ) involve 4 week randomize control trial conduct strict double-blind condition . Fidelity blind process assessed end period patient raters . Phase 2 involve provision open label treatment patient receive sham treatment wish receive 'active ' rTMS . Responders active treatment phase 1 2 ( define 50 % reduction MADRS score persist 1 week follow end acute treatment ) enter phase 3 , 6 month maintenance phase . During time , single rTMS treatment session provide every week 2 month every 2 week 4 month . Acute treatment 4 week reinstate persistent ( 2 week ) increase MADRS score &gt; 25 % .</detailed_description>
