	<detailed_description>The goal work test information infrastructure create three-way link among individual , health care provider public health authority , test efficacy system improve prevention control influenza . Our model comprise full feedback system electronic personally control health record ( PCHR ) provide primary data source population-based surveillance vehicle delivery health promotion message , case influenza immunization control . This system fee draw data statewide real-time influenza surveillance system , integrate hospital/provider data system , form three-way link . The influenza pandemic `` great global infectious disease threat '' { Osterholm , 2005 } ill prepared . With limited vaccine supply past two year probably next year well , critical : understand vaccinate ameliorate population-wide transmission ; effective channel deliver health directive high risk group ; monitor efficacy . We deploy test three-way link model PCHR record system multisite study evaluate use randomize controlled design effect immunization rate tailor message influenza immunization deliver patient electronic health record . Our focus child age 6 month ten year age household member ( two four setting ) , age group include child work adult ( two setting ) , university students/staff ( one setting ) . The specific aim follow . Aim 1.To leverage electronic personally control health record public health tool , establish three way communication system among individual , health system , public health agency . We establish formal mechanism patient integrate share healthcare-based personally entered information . Individuals share information medical record , response survey deliver system . There two way communication record State Immunization Registry . Particular attention pay information security , compliance Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) privacy rule , personal control . Primary measurement include structural integrity information system , use usability system , user acceptance . The main hypothesis test people generally willing share personally control data promote personal public health . Aim 2 . To adapt traditional syndromic surveillance system , initially design early detector outbreak , nimbly identify patient targeted behavior change personally control electronic record . We develop health message cue action , direct improve individual compliance influenza prevention , calibrate detection model identify high risk group , base demographic clinical data contain personal health record . Messages target appropriate risk group contain information tailor individual 's characteristic . The primary focus encourage influenza immunization indicate conversely , encourage delay immunization condition low risk scarcity . We change content , tempo , target message base real time influenza surveillance . The main hypothesis test real-time surveillance system use calibrate health messaging . A second hypothesis sentinel individual provide data surveillance system add value already collect . Aim 3 . To measure impact immunization rate tailor health message , link surveillance , deliver personal health record . We evaluate impact direct communication deliver randomly select study participant personal health record influenza vaccination rate compare rate among control participant . Secondary outcome include message impact rate self-reported illness , knowledge , attitude beliefs influenza immunization efficacy , use recommend health protective behavior . We investigate impact technology use immunization rate range individual social demographic characteristic , household characteristic , computing-related factor may influence acceptability propose technology and/or target health behavior . The main hypothesis test individual expose tailor health message deliver PCHR high influenza immunization rate unexposed peer . Secondary hypothesis compliance moderate compute experience , acceptability/accessibility , individual demographic ( e.g. , age , sex , race/ethnicity , social class ) social scheduling support ( e.g. , work/time schedule flexibility ) , family health factor , logistical factor ( transportation , ease access immunization site , convenience , clear scheduling/notification minimal waiting time service ) .</detailed_description>
