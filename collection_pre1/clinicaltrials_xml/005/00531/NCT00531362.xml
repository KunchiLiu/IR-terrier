	<brief_summary>Aspirin essential drug treatment cardiovascular disease . The standard dose 75mg per day ( much low inflammation fever ) . One side-effects aspirin gastric ulcer fatal . To prevent common use enteric-coated aspirin . This pass stomach intact dissolve intestine . This prevent high level drug form stomach reduce ulcer formation . Recently evidence high level aspirin resistance , ie , patient appear achieve maximum benefit aspirin . Clinical study show significant increase mortality among patient . A recent study perform show enteric-coated aspirin effective plain aspirin . This especially noticeable heavy volunteer . In fact appear enteric-coated aspirin delivers 50mg aspirin instead full 75 mg. For volunteer resistant enteric-coated aspirin simply switch plain aspirin solve problem . We propose recruit patient 75 mg enteric aspirin test evidence poor response aspirin . Poor responder give 75mg plain aspirin test response . Those fail respond receive 150 mg aspirin . If result healthy volunteer study replicate would provide cheap effective solution serious problem .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enteric Coating Factor Aspirin Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent study show clear evidence pharmacokinetic aspirin resistance healthy volunteer due poor bioavailability enteric-coated aspirin . However , necessary confirm pharmacokinetic resistance important factor aspirin resistance patient population well . To achieve compare response patient enteric-coated aspirin plain aspirin open-labeled cross-over study patient undergoing treatment enteric-coated aspirin . Patient population : Patients recruit Dr. David Foley 's clinic Beaumont Hospital . All patient prescribe enteric-coated aspirin ( 75 mg , brand ) consider eligible enrollment provide competent give inform consent . Patients diagnosis , age medication consider eligible . Patients likely stop aspirin therapy within week due plan surgery showing sign adverse effect aspirin exclude . Patients already enrol clinical study also exclude . Study design : After obtain informed consent appointment make patient return give blood sample ( ideally 1-2 week ) . The patient remind importance compliance ask keep diary aspirin use . On scheduled visit blood sample take patient advise keep take aspirin would advise outcome test within week . After platelet function assessment patient adequate inhibition platelet function inform aspirin dose fine , remind importance compliance role study terminate . Patients meet target level inhibition ask return hospital switch plain aspirin . They ask return two week visit . Platelet function assess . If target inhibition achieve terminate study agreement physician switch plain aspirin future use . Those patient achieve target inhibition switch 150 mg plain aspirin daily . A final escalation 300 mg use necessary . Platelet function test Serum thromboxane . The gold-standard test aspirin effect serum thromboxane production determine ELISA . A 5ml blood sample collect serum tube incubate 37ºC 30 min . The tube centrifuge serum remove frozen -20ºC analyse . In previous study baseline serum thromboxane level healthy volunteer 276±99 ng/ml ( ±SD ; n=142 ) thus 95 % inhibition would represent 13 ng/ml . We previously show serum thromboxane value 2.2 ng/ml effective marker platelet function . This test unaffected medication except anti-coagulants warfarin . Arachidonic acid-induced aggregation . A second test measure effectiveness aspirin arachidonic acid-induced aggregation . Blood collect sodium citrate centrifuge generate platelet-rich plasma . Arachidonic acid Experimental design ( continue ) add PRP stir platelet aggregometer . In healthy volunteer plain aspirin reduce aggregation response 4 % aggregation . Supernatant thromboxane . We recently develop novel assay extremely sensitive inhibition aspirin . This effect combination two assay describe . The supernatant arachidonic acid-induced aggregation experiment collect frozen -20ºC . The thromboxane level sample determine ELISA . Verify Now ( aspirin ) : Point-of-care assay useful diagnose aspirin resistance . It allow instantaneous feedback doctor allow remedial action take immediately . One effective point-of-care device Ultegra Verify Now device Accumetrics . This cartridge-based system monitor aggregation response arachidonic acid whole blood . A small aliquot blood test aspirin resistance use Verify Now assay . Study outcome . 1 . This study provide estimate incidence incomplete inhibition COX patient enteric coat aspirin . We plan recruit 50 patient &lt; 95 % inhibition provide margin error 15 % estimate . 2 . We determine enteric-coating aspirin responsible incomplete inhibition . 3 . We determine patient incomplete inhibition COX plain aspirin benefit increase dose aspirin . 4 . We obtain data sensitivity reliability various aspirin response assay . Benefits research . Cardiovascular disease still major cause death Ireland today . Treatment low-dose aspirin key strategy prevent cardiovascular event . Recently enteric-coated aspirin preparation become standard despite paucity information bioequivalence plain aspirin . The poorly define phenomenon aspirin resistance show adversely impact benefit aspirin therapy associate use enteric-coated aspirin . This study allow u quantify extent aspirin non-response patient enteric-coated aspirin confirm use plain aspirin overcome resistance . This provide cost-effective solution major problem cardiovascular disease treatment strategy .</detailed_description>
