	<brief_summary>Capecitabine oxaliplatin ( XELOX ) active first-line therapy patient metastatic colorectal cancer . Phase II study TS-1 , novel oral fluoropyrimidine derivative , show activity patient metastatic colorectal carcinoma . Preclinical data TS-1 oxaliplatin show synergistic activity vivo human colorectal cancer xenograft . There data optimal dose TS-1 2 week schedule combine oxaliplatin . Therefore phase I study , would like determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) TS-1 oxaliplatin define recommend dose subsequent phase II study . And , phase II study would like evaluate efficacy ( response rate ) toxicities new combination regimen advance colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
