	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Study Inhaled Carbon Monoxide Kidney Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mechanisms carbon monoxide exert effect prevent damage graft appear vary among model organ common theme carbon monoxide act potent anti-inflammatory molecule . Carbon monoxide affect several intracellular signal pathway . In addition , carbon monoxide generates increase level anti-inflammatory molecule . Evaluate safety tolerability three carbon monoxide dose level consist single 0.7 mg/kg dose single 2.0 mg/kg dose administer post-operatively single 2.0 mg/kg dose , single 3.0mg/kg dose 3.5 mg/kg dose administer intra-operatively inhale gas 1 hour , assessment adverse event ( AEs ) , vital sign , laboratory variable , serum carboxyhemoglobin ( COHb ) , oxygenation , electrocardiography ( ECG ) , neurocognitive status patient receive kidney transplant .</detailed_description>
