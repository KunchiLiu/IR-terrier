	<brief_summary>Trauma patient high risk develop deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . The incidence DVT vary greatly 5-63 % among study depend patient 's individual risk factor , modality prophylaxis , method detection . The incidence PE may low ( 0.3-4.3 % ) carry mortality 20-50 % make prevention DVT utmost importance . The current standard care DVT prophylaxis trauma patient high risk DVT enoxaparin , low molecular weight heparin , administer twice day long anticoagulation contraindicate . Many study demonstrate efficacy compare mechanical compression unfractionated heparin , however one robust study still report DVT incidence 35 % patient treat enoxaparin . Another drug , fondaparinux , selective factor Xa inhibitor could offer added benefit enoxaparin daily dose drastically reduce risk heparin induce thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) . Fondaparinux already widely use post-operative hip surgery major knee surgery patient good result . It also show effective DVT prophylaxis patient major abdominal surgery also acute medical patient . Fondaparinux yet use trauma patient . Trauma patient diverse distinct population give acuity injury increase risk bleeding time still perfect method DVT prophylaxis . We hypothesize fondaparinux effective decreasing risk DVT use trauma patient population . This non randomized prospective cohort study design test efficacy fondaparinux prophylaxis DVT PE trauma patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Fondaparinux Preventing Thromboembolism High Risk Trauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients trauma admit San Francisco General Hospital qualify study assign +fondaparinux fondaparinux arm base guideline develop consider standard care use low molecular weight heparin group patient indication . These guideline separate patient risk DVT high risk high risk . The primary efficacy outcome measure DVT PE . Presence DVT assess serial color flow duplex ultrasound patient hospital stay weekly interval 3 week patient symptom DVT . PE diagnose accord clinical suspicion patient treat physician subsequent image CT. We plan enrol approximately 100 patient +fondaparinux 100 patient fondaparinux arm . We compare incidence DVT PE group incidence literature historical control . A second aim study evaluate adverse outcome increase bleed patient receive fondaparinux . A third final aim study describe effect fondaparinux antifactor Xa level trauma patient .</detailed_description>
