	<brief_summary>Improving current strategy detection early stage disease impact favorably long-term survival woman ovarian cancer . To reduce morbidity mortality ovarian cancer , screen disease must detect early stage disease rather advanced stage disease . Thus challenge future identify develop highly sensitive specific tumor marker apply population-based screen early detection ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
