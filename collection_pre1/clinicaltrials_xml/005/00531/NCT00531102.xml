	<brief_summary>Currently , newborn receive 100 % supplemental oxygen free flow remain cyanotic despite demonstrate regular respiratory effort . Resuscitating infant continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) room air may improve oxygen saturation quickly provide FFO2 ability establish functional residual capacity lung . Our primary hypothesis blind , randomize control trial , infant ( ≥35 week gestation ) resuscitate CPAP room air oxygen saturation ≥80 % five minute age compare infant resuscitate 50 % FFO2 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Establishing Functional Residual Capacity During Newborn Resuscitation Oxygenation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTERVENTION Resuscitation proceed per standard care infant receive respiratory support remain cyanotic despite 30 second spontaneous regular respiration . All infant pulse oximetry probe place right hand ( pre-ductal position ) immediately birth . Alarm limit set . The pulse oximetry probe first place infant attach cable connect pulse oximeter show result shorter time detect good quality signal . The pulse oximeter set `` maximum '' sensitivity average time 2 second . Randomization occur time delivery . Infants meet entry criterion randomize resuscitation one two Neopuff CPAP circuit : GROUP 1 ( 21 % CPAP ) - infant receive CPAP 21 % oxygen 6 cm H2O continuously least 5 minute . GROUP 2 ( 50 % FFO2 ) - infant receive equivalent 100 % FFO2 least 5 minute . Note infant receive 100 % FFO2 actually inspire approximately 50 % oxygen entrain room air . To allow u maintain blind intervention , infant FFO2 group actually receive 50 % oxygen provide via T-piece infant resuscitator modify deliver pressure airway . The FiO2 ( 21 % 50 % ) set study investigator attend delivery . An anaesthesia monitor ( Datex Ohmeda ) connect in-line Neopuff T-piece face mask record airway pressure , end tidal carbon dioxide level concentration inspire oxygen ( confirm infant receive either 21 % 50 % oxygen ) . A treatment failure group define follow : 1 . Infant stop make spontaneous respiratory effort 2 . Infant fail achieve oxygen saturation 75 % 3 minute age 80 % 5 minute age . These value near low limit normal healthy infant transition room air . 3 . Heart rate &lt; 60 beat per minute In event treatment failure , resuscitation proceed intermittent PPV deliver 100 % oxygen use flow-inflating bag mask system available resuscitation warmer . We choose switch bag mask system instance unblind study ( see section blind ) . Chest compression start 30 second tactile stimulation positive pressure ventilation fail increase HR &gt; 60 bpm . We recognize data suggest provide 100 % oxygen best approach treat bradycardia preterm newborn . However , current standard care . None preterm infant enrol room air resuscitation study require chest compression . If pulse oximeter register good signal , resuscitation continue current inspired O2 concentration long HR &gt; 100 bpm . This also apply period time immediately follow birth prior POM give clear reading . In experience , able reliably obtain good-quality pulse oximetry signal within 30 second probe application newborn infant use method suggest O'Donnel colleague . Blood gas draw within 30 60 minute admission NICU per routine practice infant admit respiratory support . All intubated infant arterial access establish via either umbilical artery , leave radial artery , right leave posterior tibial artery ( post-ductal location ) via right radial artery ( pre-ductal location ) . Infants without arterial access blood gas data collect give limited utility PaO2 estimate capillary venous sample . RANDOMIZATION AND CONCEALEMENT Block randomization use random block size 2 4 use computer generate randomization schedule increase likelihood equal enrolment group . The randomization procedure occur site treatment assignment ( 21 % CPAP , 50 % FFO2 ) keep opaque ( manila envelope foil insert ) , sequentially number , seal envelope lock drawer NICU . Infants randomize immediately prior birth since randomize infant follow clinical assessment would delay onset resuscitative procedure . It recognize infant randomize require respiratory support . While central computer randomization definite advantage use opaque envelope , use resuscitation study difficult give time constraint . Treatment assignment conceal everyone apart study investigator attend delivery . The resuscitation team , biostatistician , data collector clinical team provide ongoing care infant NICU blind intervention . This achieve randomize infant either modified standard T-piece infant resuscitator circuit . The circuit 50 % FFO2 group alter pressure generate mask hold infant 's face . The circuit 21 % CPAP group unaltered hence generate CPAP hold face . It possible detect unit modify without dismantle . The circuit pressure gauge also cover . The study investigator blind he/she appropriately set FiO2 either 21 % 50 % . We custom mobile research cart shield oxygen blender , pulse oximetry monitor , T-piece infant resuscitation unit anaesthesia monitor view resuscitation team SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION The sample size estimate base primary outcome proportion infant reach oxygen saturation ≥80 % 5 minute age . A sample size 138 infant ( 69 group ) would require detect difference 20 % ( 71 % 91 % ) 80 % power 5 % level significance ( two-tailed ) . The sample size estimate secondary outcome measure proportion infant reach oxygen saturation ≥90 % 10 minute age 214 ( 107 group ) . This 80 % power detect difference 20 % ( 43 % 63 % ) two adjacent mean 5 % level significance ( two-tailed test ) . We plan enroll 220 infant ( 110 group ) provide adequate power address primary secondary outcome . DATA ANALYSIS An intention treat principal use infant receive respiratory support analyze group randomize . Exclusion randomization occur infant would qualify receive 50 % FFO2 per NRP guideline . A comparison proportion infant achieve target saturation 5 10 minute age perform use Chi-squared test . Other clinical parameter continuous variable analyze use t-tests distribution approximately normal . These variable include duration respiratory support NICU , length stay NICU PaO2 time NICU admission . If normalizing transformation find censored observation occur , time variable analyze use survival analysis technique . Binary outcome ( occurrence air leak , IVH , death , NICU admission ) compare use Chi Square test . Apgar score 1 , 5 10 minute ordinal variable compare use Mann-Whitney U test ( Wilcoxon rank sum test ) . An interim analysis plan .</detailed_description>
