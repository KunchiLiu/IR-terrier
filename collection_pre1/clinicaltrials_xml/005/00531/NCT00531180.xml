	<brief_title>4-Dimensional CT Derived Ventilation Versus SPECT Aerosol Ventilation Patients With Thoracic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By use 4-dimensional ( 4D ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan researcher create ventilation ( circulation air ) calculation . This new calculation method quicker may produce good image standard ventilation calculation . If agree take part study find eligible , lung function imaging . Lung function image give researcher information well lungs work , air move lung breathe , blood circulation lung . You three 4D CT scan perform breathe quietly . A 2-inch plastic box place top chest monitor motion chest scanning . After CT scanner ( scan finish ) , ventilation image calculate 4D CT image compare standard ventilation image method . The 4D CT image take 30 minute complete . As part standard care , finish 4D CT scan , single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) pulmonary ( lung ) ventilation scan perform . The SPECT ventilation scan require first breathe radioactive aerosol ( mist , call Tc-99m DPTA ) , help study doctor tell air go breathe . Then place SPECT scanner , image take lung . The SPECT image take 1 hour complete . Within 10 day first image session , return second imaging session . During second imaging session , standard care SPECT pulmonary perfusion ( blood supply tissue organ ) test do . During test , radioactive substance give vein ( call Tc-99m MAA ) . This substance get trap lung , SPECT image show blood flow lung . This test take 45-60 minute complete . Once complete second imaging session , participation study . This investigational study . All imaging scan use study FDA approve commercially available . The calculation ventilation image 4D CT scan investigational authorize use research . Up 36 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients pathologic diagnosis esophagus lung cancer ( Stage I IV ) . 2 . Patients must able lie flat duration treatment planning session . 3 . Patients must sign informed consent . 4 . Patients schedule receive radiation therapy . 5 . A cohort 6 lung cancer patient whose primary tumor move great 1 cm recruit ( CPAP cohort ) . 1 . Significant pleural effusion evaluate attend Radiation Oncologist exclude . 2 . Women childbearing potential ( A woman childbearing potential sexually mature woman undergone hysterectomy naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month [ i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ] ) male participant must practice effective contraception ( oral , injectable , implantable hormonal contraceptive ; tubal ligation ; intrauterine device ; barrier contraceptive spermicide ; vasectomized partner ) throughout study . 3 . Patients severe COPD asthma exclude CPAP cohort .</criteria>
