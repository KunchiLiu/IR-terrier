	<brief_summary>The purpose study study effect switch antiretroviral combination include two ritonavir boost protease inhibitor replacement two protease inhibitor new protease inhibitor call Darunavir ( also boost ritonavir ) . The study investigate effect switch viral load ( level HIV virus blood ) , immunological parameter ( CD4 count ) safety parameter also quality life . In subgroup patient impact switch body 's response hormone insulin also measure ( Euglycaemic clamp sub group )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Double Protease Inhibitor Darunavir Switch Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV-RNA CD4+ cell count monitor virological immunological response switch DRV/r . Routine safety blood include haematology biochemistry ( include U &amp; E , fast glucose insulin , liver function test , fast cholesterol triglyceride serum lactate measurement ) . Quality life EuroQOL questionnaires baseline , throughout study evaluate quality life continue treatment/ treatment switch arm . A sub group 10 patient undergo two euglycaemic clamp procedure order determine extent glucose disposal . The first clamp perform prior switch double boost PI therapy DRV/r second one follow administration DRV/r 4 week .</detailed_description>
