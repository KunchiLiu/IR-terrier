	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving temozolomide together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give temozolomide together bevacizumab work treat patient stage IV melanoma remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate efficacy temozolomide combination bevacizumab patient unresectable stage IV melanoma . Secondary - To evaluate safety tolerability regimen . Tertiary - To evaluate prognostic predictive significance circulate endothelial cell endothelial progenitor cell patient treat regimen . - To predict tumor response outcome patient treat regimen measure hypermethylation tumor . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral temozolomide daily day 1-7 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood collect baseline day 1 course 2 . Samples analyze circulate endothelial cell endothelial progenitor cell flow cytometry pro- anti-angiogenic serum factor ELISA . Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue analyze MGMT promoter methylation status methylation-specific PCR ; MGMT protein expression IHC ; MSH2 , MSH6 , MLH-1 expression ( DNA repair enzyme ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
