	<detailed_description>Patients attend antenatal care clinic Assiut University Hospital recruit counsel participate study . A write informed consent take . Patients right refuse participate and/or withdraw study ay time without denied regular full clinical care . Personal information well data collect subject confidentiality make available third party . Gestational age determine basis last menstrual period , confirm ultrasound 14 week 20 week gestation calculate menstrual week . Patients include pregnant +/- 28 32 week , document history least one preterm labour previous pregnancy uterine contraction time study . Patients exclude refused participate study , prelabour premature rupture membrane ( PPROM ) , incompetent cervical o prove funneling internal o ultrasound examination document history without cercelage do previous current pregnancy . Patients twin pregnancy , intrauterine foetal death , malpresentations , know fetal anomaly , progesterone heparin treatment current pregnancy , hypertension require medication , seizure disorder , Irregular and/or unsure menstrual date abortion within 3 month prior last menses also exclude . Clinical work-up include history taking , examination , obstetric ultrasound evaluation Bio physical profile ( BPP ) . All Patients empirically treat bacterial vaginosis prior enrollment one study group give oral metronidazole 250 mgm 3 times/day one week . After end one course treatment patient subject vaginal swab exclude bacterial vaginosis . Criteria use diagnose BV Amsel et al. , 1983 find least three four follow criterion : 1 ) thin , dark dull gray , homogenous , malodorous discharge adheres vaginal wall ; 2 ) elevate vaginal pH great 4.5 ; 3 ) positive whiff/amine test , 4 ) presence clue cell wet-mount microscopic evaluation . Patients free sample include study . Patients prove active mixed infection treat accordingly exclude study . Patients randomly allocate two treatment group . Group one , control group : give hydroxyl progesterone caproate ( 150mgm ) every 3 day start 28th week pregnancy till complete 36 week gestation . Group two patient give hydroxyl progesterone caproate ( 150mgm ) weekly injection plus NAC 0.6 gm ( Sedico , Egypt ) orally daily start 28th week pregnancy till delivery complete 36th week pregnancy . Patients follow routine 2 week antenatal clinic visit occurrence uterine contraction , frequency , intensity need seek medical advise . NAC 17 hydroxyl progesterone caproate treatment discontinue group patient either complete 36 week enter actively labour ( least three uterine contraction , 40 second , reach 50 mmHg external tocodynamometer monitoring and/or associate progressive cervical dilatation reach 5 cm and/or occurrence rupture membrane ) . Once establish labour , second vaginal swab take subjected microscopical examination amine test rule newly develop BV . Outcomes include occurrence contraction , prolongation pregnancy , neonatal outcome group . Sample size : Sample size base finding Iams et al. , find high incidence recurrent PTL among woman positive finding infection ( 64 % ) . A reduction incidence PTL 30 % consider acceptable . Sample size calculate basis 95 % confidence interval , 80 % power 49 patient need arm .</detailed_description>
