	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify confirm new blood tissue marker prognosis tumor hypoxia . Tumor hypoxia , condition low oxygen tumor , show increase risk tumor spread enhance tumor resistance standard treatment radiation chemotherapy head neck lung cancer . We recently identify several protein marker blood tumor ( include osteopontin , lysyl oxidase , macrophage inhibit factor proteomic technology ) laboratory may able identify tumor low oxygen level aggressive behaving tumor .</brief_summary>
