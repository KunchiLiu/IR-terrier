	<brief_summary>A randomised three period cross trial carry adult ( 19-64 year ) ass acute chronic effect large dose apple procyanidin ( PA ) compare low dose apple PA ( negative control ) aspirin ( positive control ) , platelet function risk factor cardiovascular disease . Platelet function assess prior run diet start end intervention . Volunteers assign random consume 230grams low PA apple puree high PA apple puree aspirin ( 75mg ) day 2 week follow minimum 14 day wash . Hypothesis : Consuming apple PA reduce platelet function consistent reduce risk cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A randomised 3-period cross-over trial carry assess acute chronic effect large dose apple PA compare low dose apple PA ( negative control ) aspirin ( positive control ) , platelet function ( flow cytometry ) risk factor CVD ( endothelial function , plasma antioxidant , inflammatory marker , lipid profile ) . Once recruit , volunteer assign random consume 230g low PA apple puree high PA apple puree aspirin ( 75mg ) day 14 day period 1 . Following minimum 14 day wash-out volunteer cross period 2 another 14-day wash-out volunteer cross complete period 3 intervention ( flow chart I ) . The acute effect treatment investigate day 15 period . A fasting blood sample obtain prior consumption standard breakfast apple puree aspirin . Further blood sample obtain 2 , 6 24 hour post-dosing . The chronic effect three treatment determine measure CVD risk factor fast blood sample obtain day 1 , 15 29 . Flow chart II provide detailed overview design period identical apple puree treatment differs omission urine collection PWV measurement aspirin period . During apple puree intervention phenolic acid analyse 24-hour urine pool collect day prior start period , well day 14 , 15 , 28 . PWV measurement carry day 15 29 12-hour overnight fast 2 apple intervention period . For intervention successful necessary exclude food source contribute significantly total PA intake ( e.g . cocoa , berry , grape , red wine , apple , legume ) limit PA food source ( tea/coffee ) level support compliance unlikely mask effect intervention . Because well documented effect platelet function alcohol restrict maximum 2 unit per day exclude completely 48 hour prior blood sample appointment . Oily fish consumption limit 2 portion per week allow 48 hour prior blood sampling . These dietary restriction may significant effect platelet function individual consume food regularly . Therefore , dietary restriction apply 14-day run-in diet prior duration intervention period . Platelet function assess prior start run-in diet well start end PA/aspirin intervention ( flow chart II ) . Male female volunteer age 19 64 recruit screen eligibility 2 month prior start intervention . Those meeting study criterion randomly assign one six possible treatment order , i.e . ABC , ACB , BAC , CAB , BCA , CBA . Randomisation stratify sex . Volunteers give user friendly booklet ( Run-in diet/Apple/Aspirin diary ) intervention period record apple puree/aspirin consumption volunteer also prompt record alcohol , tea/coffee oily fish intake ( Annex 2 ) . Foods allow intervention period list . Volunteers remind consume oily fish ( list ) , alcohol , coffee tea 48 hour prior blood sample appointment .</detailed_description>
