	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether give paclitaxel together carboplatin effective give temozolomide alone treat patient melanoma . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well give paclitaxel together carboplatin give temozolomide alone work treat patient stage IV melanoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To assess anti-tumor activity toxicity profile time delivery conventional paclitaxel carboplatin ( PC ) patient stage IV melanoma receive prior chemotherapy metastatic disease . - To assess anti-tumor activity toxicity profile time delivery conventional temozolomide ( TMZ ) chemotherapy patient stage IV melanoma receive prior chemotherapy metastatic disease . - To assess anti-tumor activity toxicity profile time delivery conventional PC patient stage IV melanoma receive prior chemotherapy metastatic disease . - To assess anti-tumor activity toxicity profile time delivery conventional TMZ chemotherapy patient stage IV melanoma receive prior chemotherapy metastatic disease . - To evaluate change T-regulator cell , melanoma-specific functional parameter function time four patient cohort . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord prior chemotherapy metastatic disease ( yes v ) schedule chemotherapy regimen ( paclitaxel carboplatin v temozolomide ) . Beginning predicted day C-reactive peptide ( CRP ) peak level , patient receive paclitaxel IV carboplatin IV day 1 , 8 , 15 OR oral temozolomide alone day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically pharmacological study . Samples analyze CRP quantification via ELISA ; presence number circulate blood T-regulator cell via immunophenotyping CD4/CD25+ CD4/fox-p3+ T cell ; level functional immunity melanoma specific antigen ( MART-1 , tyrosinase , gp100 ) survivin patient HLA-A2+ via intracellular staining ; total number cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) capable react melanoma target via tetramer staining ( Becton-Coulter ) ; quantification interferon γ-producing , peptide-specific CTLs via multicolor conventional flow cytometry . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
