	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , hydroxychloroquine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving hydroxychloroquine together bortezomib may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose hydroxychloroquine give together bortezomib see well work treat patient relapsed refractory multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To establish dose-limiting toxicity maximum tolerate dose hydroxychloroquine add standard-dose regimen bortezomib treatment patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma . Secondary - To obtain preliminary estimate toxicity rate response rate combination maximum tolerate dose . - To confirm preclinical evidence show synergistic effect hydroxychloroquine bortezomib correlate response rate blood level hydroxychloroquine degree autophagy inhibition repeat bone marrow sample . OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation study hydroxychloroquine follow phase II study . - Phase I : Patients receive oral hydroxychloroquine every day 2 week . Patients receive oral hydroxychloroquine 1-3 time daily every day bortezomib IV twice week 2 week . Treatment hydroxychloroquine bortezomib repeat every 3 week least 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Once maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) hydroxychloroquine determine , additional patient accrue phase II portion study . - Phase II : Patients receive hydroxychloroquine ( MTD determine phase I ) bortezomib phase I . Blood bone marrow sample collect periodically study correlative study mass spectrometry , proteasome inhibition assay , pharmacokinetic analysis assessment aggresome formation , autophagy inhibition , apoptosis protein electrophoresis serum free light-chain analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
