	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease major cause death hemodialysis population calcification major artery ( coronary , aorta , carotid ) play central role process . The major cause calcification many , include high level phosphorus , low level inhibitor calcification , positive calcium balance , oxidative stress . Once vascular calcification present , usually progressive . There know treatment reverse establish vascular calcification . Sodium thiosulfate use extensively safely treat calcific uremic arteriopathy ( disease , part due calcification small artery ) dialysis patient . It increase solubility calcium 100,000 fold also potent anti-oxidant . It therefore potential also decrease amount calcium large artery dialysis patient , hence improve survival . We study hemodialysis ( HD ) patient high risk cardiovascular disease death obtain multidetector computerize tomography ( MDCT ) Scan coronary artery , carotid artery aorta assessment coronary artery stenoses simultaneous intravenous infusion contrast . At set , perform test pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) carotid ultrasound carotid intima-media thickness ( CIMT ) study . In patient high risk cardiovascular death , define coronary artery calcification score ( CACS ) great 50 , sodium thiosulfate dose 12.5-25 gm/1.73 M2 infuse 15-30 minute dialysis treatment 5 month . The study repeat .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis 1 : The treatment HD patient high CAC score sodium thiosulfate 5 month decrease amount calcium coronary artery . Patients high risk coronary calcification ( history MI , ischemic heart disease , peripheral carotid artery disease ) select undergo test . We recruit 60 HD patient receive treatment unit undergo MDCT scan along non-invasive test PWV CIMT . Assuming 60 % CAC score â‰¥50 , 36 patient treated sodium thiosulfate . We administer 25 % sodium thiosulfate solution ( American Reagent Laboratories , Shirley , NY ) dose 12.5-25g/1.73m2 per 15-30 minute hemodialysis session total 60 treatment ( 5 month ) . Assuming 35 % attrition rate , 23 patient complete entire protocol undergo repeat study initial battery test . Rationale treatment sodium thiosulfate : Sodium thiosulfate , use antidote cyanide poison century , also anti-oxidant , bind calcium form highly soluble calcium thiosulfate salt . The solubility calcium thiosulfate salt 250-100,000 fold high calcium oxalate calcium phosphate salt . It use treat recurrent calcium kidney stone tumoral calcinosis ( ectopic calcification usually around joint ) . It also use successfully treat calcific uremic arteriopathy , disease small artery soft tissue calcification , several study dialysis patient experience 5 patient . By 2 month radiological evidence reduction soft tissue calcification . Unpublished data also demonstrate regression establish aortic calcification uremic rat . Sodium thiosulfate FDA approve medication treatment cyanide poisoning . It classify FDA `` generally recognize safe '' . There known contraindication . The side effect report intravenous ( IV ) administration ESRD patient nausea , vomit hyperosmia administration , alleviate pre-administration anti-emetic medication . Sodium thiosulfate slowly give dialysis venous line toward end HD treatment . The select dose pilot study use treatment calcific uremic arteriopathy . We freeze 10 ml serum obtain prior monthly treatment subsequent analysis . Included analysis Fetuin-A level relevant marker consider . Blood also freeze future genomic study .</detailed_description>
