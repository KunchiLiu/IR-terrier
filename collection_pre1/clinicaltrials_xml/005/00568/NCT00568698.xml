	<brief_title>A Pilot Therapeutic Trial Using Hydroxyurea Type I Spinal Muscular Atrophy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SMA neuromuscular disorder characterize degeneration spinal cord motor neuron muscular atrophy . SMA classify three clinical subtypes accord severity age onset ( Types I , II III ) . Type I SMA ( also call severe , infantile acute SMA , Werdnig-Hoffman disease ) severe phenotype . The onset symptom within first 6 month life , weakness intercostal muscle lack airway protection lead respiratory insufficiency aspiration pneumonia , often result early infant death . In laboratory , preliminary result indicate HU treatment significantly increase SMN mRNA expression intact SMN protein level vitro . These data confirm previous observation vitro treatment SMA lymphocytes hydroxyurea result augmentation SMN2 gene expression dose time related manner . Based excite pre-clinical data , couple well-documented side-effect profile HU child , conduct pilot clinical trial use HU child Type I SMA . This clinical trial study intend establish safety profile child Type I SMA ; identify reliable outcome measure ; detect possible clinical efficacy HU treatment child Type I SMA .</detailed_description>
