	<brief_title>A Pilot Therapeutic Trial Using Hydroxyurea Type II Type III Spinal Muscular Atrophy Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SMA neuromuscular disorder characterize degeneration spinal cord motor neuron muscular atrophy . SMA classify three clinical subtypes accord severity age onset ( Types I , II III ) . Type II ( intermediate ) SMA onset early childhood ( prior 18 month ) characterize failure stand walk unassisted . Individuals Type III SMA ( mild SMA Kugelberg-Welander disease ) typically develop symptom 18 month age display wide range clinical heterogeneity . The clinical spectrum range rapid progressive weakness result wheelchair dependence late childhood patient able walk adult year live productive independent lifestyle majority live . In laboratory , preliminary result indicate HU treatment significantly increase SMN mRNA expression intact SMN protein level vitro . These data confirm previous observation vitro treatment SMA lymphocytes hydroxyurea result augmentation SMN2 gene expression dose time related manner . Based excite pre-clinical data , couple well-documented side-effect profile HU child , conduct pilot clinical trial use HU child Types II III SMA . This clinical trial study intend establish safety profile child Types II III SMA ; identify reliable outcome measure ; detect possible clinical efficacy HU treatment child Types II III SMA .</detailed_description>
