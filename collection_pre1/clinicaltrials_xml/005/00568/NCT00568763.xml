	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiofrequency therapy radiofrequency ablation use high-frequency electric current kill tumor cell . Radiofrequency therapy also cause body produce heat-shock protein may help kill tumor cell . Cryotherapy kill tumor cell freeze . It yet know whether heat-shock protein cause radiofrequency therapy give together radiofrequency ablation cryotherapy effective treating stage IV melanoma radiofrequency therapy-induced heat-shock protein alone . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study side effect radiofrequency therapy-induced endogenous heat-shock protein give alone together radiofrequency ablation cryotherapy treat patient stage IV melanoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety feasibility endogenous heat-shock protein ( hsp ) 70 synthesis site tumor use radiofrequency therapy ( RFT ) patient stage IV malignant melanoma . - Determine safety feasibility hsp70 release circulation use RFT alone vs RFT follow radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) cryotherapy patient . - Determine feasibility induce primary antitumor immune response use RFT without additional local therapy ( i.e. , RFA cryotherapy ) patient . - Gain preliminary insight antitumor efficacy vivo heat shock vaccine patient . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 arm . - Arm I ( close enrollment 12/7/06 ) : Patients undergo percutaneous biopsy target lesion placement localization marker . Patients undergo radiofrequency therapy ( RFT ) target lesion induce production endogenous heat-shock protein . After procedure complete , patient undergo second biopsy target lesion . Patients also receive intratumoral injection sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) promote ablation tumor site . - Arm II : Patients undergo percutaneous biopsy RFT arm I follow radiofrequency ablation target lesion . Patients also receive intratumoral GM-CSF arm I . - Arm III : Patients undergo percutaneous biopsy RFT arm I follow cryoablation target lesion . Patients also receive intratumoral GM-CSF arm I. Tumor tissue sample obtain core biopsy immediately immediately RFT RNA protein analysis . Tissue sample assess immunohistochemistry tumor phenotype ( i.e. , MART-1 , tyrosinase , gp100 ) quantification infiltrate lymphocyte . Peripheral blood sample also obtain treatment periodically study immunologic analysis . Peripheral blood-derived lymphocyte test panel monoclonal antibody estimate percentage cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTLs ) , include CD4+ CD8+ T cell well B cell , monocyte , dendritic cell . In addition , assay perform estimate T-cell response polyclonal stimulus ( i.e. , PHA ) , recall antigen ( i.e. , tetanus toxoid ) , HLA alloantigens . Estimates peptide-specific CTLs also obtain enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay vitro stimulation peptide-sensitized stimulator cell . Antibodies extractable nuclear antigen ( ENA ) antinuclear antibody ( ANA ) also evaluate . GM-CSF level Hsp70 assess tumor cell peripheral blood flow cytometry enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
