	<detailed_description>Insomnia affect half US population . Epidemiological data indicate 36 % 56 % American adult report occasional insomnia , 9 % 17 % report chronic severe problem insomnia . This condition prevalent elderly . Elderly insomnia sufferer may experience difficulty stay asleep young adult ; increase wakefulness sleep period result opportunity get bed . Elderly individual insomnia risk fall get bed sleep period . It known risk merely result bed , insomnia physiological process ( eg , postural hypotension ) contribute . This risk significant fall may result severe injury , include hip fracture , morbidity mortality statistic remarkable . Approximately one-third sustain hip fracture place long-term care facility . Of patient hospitalize due hip fracture , 15 % die hospital 33 % die within one year sustaining fracture . One important concern regard risk fall elderly patient insomnia relate commonly accepted pharmacological treatment insomnia . Although normal control sleep-wake cycle exert suprachiasmatic nucleus via melatonin receptor subtypes 1 2 receptor , current pharmacologic treatment insomnia mainly involve GABAergic ( gamma aminobutyric acid ) mechanism : currently prescribe sleep agent benzodiazepine receptor agonist , bind benzodiazepine receptor site gamma aminobutyric acid receptor complex . Gamma aminobutyric acid major inhibitory transmitter central nervous system receptor distribute widely throughout brain . In addition sleep , benzodiazepine receptor agonist cause wide range ancillary effect directly relate sleep , depend precise subset gamma aminobutyric acid receptor activate . These include sedative , anxiolytic , muscle-relaxant , amnesic effect . Drugs act receptor complex , specifically benzodiazepine , deleterious effect body sway . Ramelteon market United States Rozerem treatment insomnia characterize difficulty sleep initiation . It 's mechanism action base agonism melatonin receptor subtype 1 2 . This study investigate effect ramelteon balance , mobility memory impairment awaken middle night follow bedtime dose . Participation study anticipate 1 1.5 month .</detailed_description>
