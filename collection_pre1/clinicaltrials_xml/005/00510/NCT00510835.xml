	<brief_title>Protocolized Care Early Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Septic shock condition acute organ dysfunction due severe infection , mortality 50 % . Current effort improve care limited little practical evidence regard intervention time sepsis therapy . ProCESS prospective , randomize , three-arm parallel-group trial alternative resuscitation strategy early septic shock . The study objective improve management septic shock explore clinical , biological , economic aspect alternative resuscitation strategy . This do compare two alternative resuscitation strategy usual care subject septic shock . Comparisons : 1 . Early Goal Directed Therapy ( EGDT ) - The subject ' blood pressure blood oxygen level monitor via insertion central venous catheter ( CVC ) . The study team use information give fluid , blood heart medication structure fashion . The central venous catheter use plan FDA approve routinely use hospital . 2 . Protocolized Standard Care ( PSC ) - The subject ' blood pressure blood oxygen level monitor standard equipment ( without CVC ) . The study team use information prescribe fluid heart medication structure fashion . CVCs use standard IVs give proper amount fluid medicine . Blood transfusion give accord currently recommend guideline . 3 . Usual Care ( UC ) - Subjects treat accord attend physician 's standard treatment plan without influence study team . The primary hypothesis test sequentially : protocolized resuscitation ( EGDT PSC ) result low hospital mortality usual care Early Goal Directed Therapy result low hospital mortality Protocolized Standard Care . These hypothesis test enrolled subject . The study power find absolute mortality reduction ( ARR ) ~6-7 % . Based control arm mortality rate , originally estimate sample size 1950 . During trial , ProCESS Coordinating Center monitor overall mortality rate , appreciate markedly low originally project . Therefore , follow series new calculation , February 2013 , trial re-sized 1350 patient ( 450 patient per arm ) . The new size preserve power find ARR . The resize fully blind approve NIH .</detailed_description>
