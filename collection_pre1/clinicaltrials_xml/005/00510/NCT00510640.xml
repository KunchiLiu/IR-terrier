	<detailed_description>The THYSU trial phase II trial sunitinib ( Sutent ) patient locally advance metastatic anaplastic , differentiated medullary thyroid carcinoma . Due argument show angiogenesis could involve progression metastatic thyroid carcinoma objective response phase I trial sunitinib , justified evaluate prospective trial efficacy sunitinib metastatic thyroid carcinoma . Furthermore , standard treatment metastatic thyroid carcinoma general treatment prescribe limited radioiodine . When radioiodine become ineffective , standard treatment despite usage chemotherapy . The objective trial determine objective tumor response rate patient locally advance metastatic anaplastic , differentiated medullary thyroid carcinoma treat sunitinib , secondary objective evaluate safety sunitinib patient thyroid carcinoma . The treatment sunitinib standard dosage schedule . Sunitinib give orally dose 50 mg daily 28 day follow 2 week rest . Forthcoming cycle remain identical . Modification dose may use low dose 37.5 mg 25 mg give daily schedule . All patient receive repeat cycle treatment disease progression , occurrence unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal patient consent , withdrawal criterion meet . After discontinuation treatment mandate 28-day follow , patient follow order collect information antineoplastic therapy survival . In patient discontinue treatment reason disease progression , tumor assessment continue disease progression , initiation antineoplastic therapy . The frequent side effect asthenia , mucositis , arterial hypertension , hand foot syndrome diarrhea . Other side effect report include nausea , vomit , cutaneous event , decrease leave ventricular ejection fraction , neutropenia , thrombopenia . The patient must meet follow inclusion criterion eligible enrollment trial : - Patients must sign date IRB/EC-approved inform consent . - Age ≥ 18 . - Patients must life expectancy least 3 month Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 % - Patients must histologically confirm TC - Tumor disease must progressive ( evidence disease progression within 6 month ) - Patients candidate surgical resection , external beam radiotherapy radioiodine , patient must one previous systemic treatment cancer - Patients must measurable disease define RECIST criterion least one lesion least 2 cm length conventional CT technique least 1 cm spiral CT scan . - Resolution acute toxic effect prior treatment NCI - CTCAE ( version 3.0 ) grade &lt; 1 . - Patients must discontinue radiation therapy least 4 week first dose study treatment must recover toxic effect treatment . - Blood pressure &lt; 140 / 90 mmHg - Patients must adequate organ function . - Patients reproductive potential must use medically acceptable contraceptive method . - Willingness ability comply study procedure . - Patient affiliate profit social security system The presence non-inclusion criterion exclude patient study enrollment . Prior undergo specific study procedure , patient investigator sign inform consent . During initial visit include verification eligibility criterion , interview patient conduct regard his/her recent past clinical treatment history ( include oncology history ) . Physical examination include examination major body system , Karnofsky performance status , body weight , height , vital sign perform . Laboratory data collect ( hematology chemistry , coagulation , thyroid test , tumor marker pregnancy test applicable ) . Para clinic evaluation ( 12-lead ECGs tumor image ) carry . LVEF assess Echocardiogram MUGA scan ( necessary ) Brain Naturatic Peptide ( Or NT pro-BNP ) test do . During follow-up , patient follow end week 4 week 6 clinical biological evaluation . Evaluation tumor site sunitinib plan every 2 cycle CT scan . For patient anaplastic differentiate thyroid carcinoma , first stage include 21 efficacy-evaluable patient . An additional 29 efficacy-evaluable patient include second stage . For patient medullary thyroid carcinoma , first stage include 11 efficacy-evaluable patient . An additional 7 14 efficacy-evaluable patient include second stage . 10 French Oncology Departments involved trial .</detailed_description>
