	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To determine efficacy Gleevec patient recurrent platinum-resistant , taxane-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer , fallopian tube cancer whose tumor express either c-KIT , platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGRF ) , ABL . 2 . To determine nature degree toxicity Gleevec cohort patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gleevec Study Patients With Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Imatinib Mesylate new medication block several protein important development cancer . Before go study , potential participant tumor test c-KIT , PDGFR , ABL positivity . Those participant least one positive biomarker eligible treatment . Before treatment start , participant complete checkup , blood test , chest x-ray , heart function test . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . A blood sample ( 3 teaspoon ) take week treatment end treatment . A complete exam also do end treatment . Tumors measure compute tomography ( CT ) scan every 6 week one study end treatment . Participants study take Imatinib Mesylate mouth single dose daily basis . Participants treat 6 week , one cycle therapy . After 6 week , participant evaluate side effect tumor response . The dose may decrease next cycle participant side effect . Participants remove study tumor get bad . Participants may remain study long tumor gotten worse intolerable side effect . This investigational study . Imatinib Mesylate approve chronic myelogenous leukemia patient . However investigational study Imatinib Mesylate patient ovarian , tubal , peritoneal cancer . Participants may responsible cost part drug . At least 24 many 74 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically confirm metastatic epithelial ovarian , primary peritoneal cancer , fallopian tube cancer previously treat platinum/taxanecontaining regimen . Patients may either lowgrade highgrade recurrent epithelial tumor . 2 . Patients highgrade tumor must platinum/taxane resistant , define : progression disease firstline platinum/taxane regimen tumor progression within 6 month completion platinum/taxane regimen . 3 . Patients highgrade tumor may fail 4 prior chemotherapy regimen . All taxane/platinum therapy count one regimen . 4 . Patients lowgrade tumor may fail unlimited prior therapy . 5 . Patients ' tumor tissue must express one follow biomarkers : cKIT , PDGFR ABL . Positivity define 2+ 3+ immunohistochemical staining . 6 . All patient must measurable disease . Measurable disease define lesion measure physical examination mean image technique . Ascites pleural effusion consider measurable disease . An elevated serum CA 125 level without associate measurable tumor consider measurable disease . 7 . Patients must pretreatment granulocyte count ( i.e. , segment neutrophils + band ) &gt; 1,500/Fl , hemoglobin level = 9.0 gm/dL platelet count &gt; 100,000/Fl . 8 . Patients must adequate renal function document serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL . 9 . Patients must adequate hepatic function document serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL , regardless whether patient liver involvement secondary tumor . Aspartate transaminase ( SGOT ) must &lt; 3* institutional upper limit normal unless liver involved tumor , case aspartate transaminase must &lt; 5* institutional upper limit normal . 10 . Patients must estimate life expectancy 12 week great . 11 . Zubrod performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . 12 . Patients must older age 18 . 13 . Patients must sign approve informed consent . 1 . Patients previously receive Gleevec . 2 . Patients active uncontrolled infection , include know HIV infection . 3 . Patients psychiatric disorder would interfere consent followup . 4 . Patients history myocardial infarction within previous six month congestive heart failure require therapy . 5 . Patients history prior malignancy except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer patient diseasefree least five year . 6 . Pregnant lactating woman . Men woman reproductive potential may participate unless agree use effective contraceptive method . 7 . Presence clinically apparent central nervous system metastases carcinomatous meningitis . 8 . Patients history seizures ineligible . Patients receive phenytoin , phenobarbital , antiepileptic prophylaxis ineligible . 9 . Patients severe concurrent disease judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study , include significant hepatic , renal , gastrointestinal disease . 10 . Patients deep venous arterial thrombosis ( include pulmonary embolism ) within 6 week study entry . 11 . Patients receive warfarin .</criteria>
