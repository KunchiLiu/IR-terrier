	<brief_summary>This study look three seizure medicine . Patients seizures usually treat phenytoin ( Dilantin ) Fosphenytoin . These medicine give intravenously ( IV ) mouth . Another seizure medicine , levetiracetam ( Keppra ) give way also . This study compare IV phenytoin ( Dilantin ) IV fosphenytoin levetiracetam ( Keppra ) patient recent seizure . Only patient history seizure involve . The patient must present emergency department within 4 hour seizure . The purpose study compare three drug , phenytoin ( Dilantin ) , fosphenytoin , levetiracetam ( Keppra ) . The investigator look see drug prevent another seizure next 24 hour . We also look possible side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IV Keppra Emergency Department Prevention Early Recurrent Seizures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More one every one hundred patient present emergency department care seizures . More half patient require medication , often intravenously ( IV ) , emergency department . For many year standard treatment phenytoin . However , many know contraindication use drug . These include know hypersensitivity , cardiac arrhythmia , cardiac disease , impair liver kidney function , diabetes mellitus , old age , thyroid disease , pregnancy , alcohol use . A recent review patient seizure disorder Emory Crawford Long Emory University hospital suggest significant percentage take phenytoin actually one contraindication . Additionally , IV form phenytoin know , severe adverse effect include cardiovascular collapse , life threaten cardiac arrhythmia , severe hypotension . There another form Phenytoin , call Fosphenytoin , safer respect still similar concern associate administration . Levetiracetam ( Keppra ) available oral drug United States since 2000 well establish safety record use add-on drug patient partial onset seizure . A double-blinded randomized study show levetiracetam also effective primary generalize seizure well . The IV form levetiracetam recently approve FDA use . The known contraindication know hypersensitivity include impaired renal function , psychiatric disorder , old age , pregnancy . IV levetiracetam know cause acute , catastrophic event see occasionally phenytoin . The investigator would therefore like compare IV phenytoin fosphenytoin IV levetiracetam prevent early recurrent seizure . Patients known seizure disorder would randomly assign one two group therefore receive either IV fosphenytoin IV levetiracetam . After observation period , seizure free patient would discharge 24 hour phone follow conduct assess effectiveness anti-seizure medication well adverse reaction .</detailed_description>
