	<brief_title>Study Comparing Radio Frequency Ablation Plus Chemotherapy Chemotherapy Alone Patients With Secondary Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The American Cancer Society estimate colorectal cancer second lead cause cancer related death , 106,370 new case diagnosed 2004 . Due unique nature hepatic circulatory system , preferential portal venous drainage gastrointestinal tract , liver common site metastatic tumor growth colorectal carcinoma . It estimate approximately 20 % patient diagnosed colorectal cancer present liver involvement time diagnosis , 50 % patient manifest metastatic involvement liver follow resection primary colorectal cancer . Over one half patient die colorectal cancer liver metastases autopsy . The current `` gold standard '' treatment isolate metastatic liver disease curative hepatic resection . Only within last 20 year surgical resection become viable option , past consider unjustified due high morbidity mortality rate . The primary drawback hepatic resection sheer number patient contraindicate . Only 10-20 % patient liver metastasis candidate surgical resection , owe factor tumor location , size , extent disease , medical co-morbidities . Historically , case hepatic resection contraindicate , systemic chemotherapy alternative treatment . In last several year increase number hepatic directed therapy become available hepatic artery ligation , radiation , hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy , chemoembolization , mechanical ablation tumor ( ) . One mechanical method ablation involve use radiofrequency thermal technology , also call radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) . The RFA procedure involve insert RF electrode center hepatic tumor mass ultrasonic CT guidance . Radiofrequency energy apply electrode , cause thermal injury surround tumor tissue . Currently two basic design monitor inter-procedural progress RFA ; temperature monitoring set point within target tissue thermocouple , assess system-wide impedance tissue adjacent deploy electrode tine . Radiofrequency ablation system comprise three component : radiofrequency generator , active electrode , dispersive electrode . To date prospective multi-center trial complete would conclusively demonstrate whether RFA effective adjunct systemic chemotherapy respect advantage median overall survival compare chemotherapy alone . The primary objective trial determine overall survival subject colorectal cancer incurable metastatic liver disease fail least first line chemotherapy treat radiofrequency ablation plus additional chemotherapy , compare subject receive additional chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
