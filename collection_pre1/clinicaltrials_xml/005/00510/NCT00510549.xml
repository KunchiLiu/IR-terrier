	<brief_summary>As influence type dialysis survival end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient remain unanswered , present study design ( randomize , prospective , multicenter , interventional ) assess clinical outcome , compare mortality , morbidity , Quality Life ( QOL ) cost effectiveness maintenance In-center Hemodialysis ( ICHD ) Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) . These data ultimately bring clarity whether difference patient survival exist two modality . In order test feasibility patient ' willingness randomize two different modality group retain randomize group , pilot study plan conduct main study . This pilot study comprise 6 month study , plus 6 month observation possibility switch patient main study . All ESRD patient require dialysis treatment within 8 week pre-study visit record site . Patients provide write inform consent collect relevant information screen use certain inclusion/exclusion criterion . Eligible patient undergo standardized education regard ESRD treatment option . Thereafter patient require provide second inform consent allow randomization entrance study . Eligible patient randomize either PD HD treatment . The patient follow period 6 month , patient treat PD HD prescribe site , meet dialysis adequacy indicator . For first 3 month monthly visit require , every 3 month visit plan . In pilot study , main objective ass willingness ESRD patient randomize either PD HD treatment ; thereby determine adequate number eligible patient recruited future large-scale study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Male female patient least 18 year age . 2 . Patients read , understood give write informed consent nature study explain . 3 . Patients diagnosis ESRD ( GFR â‰¤ 10 ml/min ) , without permanent access dialysis . 4 . Patients able comprehend modality education program . 5 . Patients judge capable train home base PD . 6 . Patients justified physician require dialysis treatment within 6 week randomization ( Patients require urgent temporary dialysis randomization may also eligible recruitment stabilize temporary HD PD ) 7 . Patients expect remain dialysis least 6 month . 8 . Patients must negative HIV test screening . 1 . Patients already receive permanent catheter access intend permanent therapy use receive modality information , already receive permanent dialysis ( If access present within 4 week prior screen backup purpose , acute treatment life threaten uremic symptom , electrolyte abnormality fluid overload , exclude patient enrollment ) . 2 . Patients previously receive renal transplantation still prescribe immunosuppressive therapy . 3 . Patients unwilling unable follow protocol . 4 . Patients concomitant participation interventional study , receive investigational drug , biologic device within five halflives physiological action 30 day , whichever longer , prior screen . 5 . Patients justify eligible either PD HD due : PD : document extensive intraperitoneal adhesion , severe infective skin disorder , situation contradict PD ( eg. , active inflammatory bowel disease ) HD : severe cardiac instability inability gain permanent vascular access . 6 . Patients history drug alcohol abuse within six month prior enter study 7 . Patients active systemic infection , tuberculosis , septicemia systemic fungal infection . 8 . Patients malignancy require active chemotherapy radiation therapy . 9 . The presence terminal illness likely cause death within 6 month 10 . Patients serious acute active condition investigator 's opinion would preclude participation study . 11 . Female patient pregnant , lactate plan become pregnant study period . 12 . Patients allergic starchbased polymer , maltose isomaltose 13 . Patients glycogen storage disease . 14 . Patients significant psychiatric disorder mental disability could interfere patient 's ability provide inform consent and/or comply protocol procedure</criteria>
