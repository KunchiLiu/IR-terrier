	<brief_title>Ranibizumab Treat Choroidal Neovascularization ( CNV ) Patients With Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum ( PXE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pseudoxanthoma elasticum ( PXE ) rare hereditary systemic disease affect mainly skin , eye cardiovascular system . Commonly , complicate choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) central retina lead severely decreased visual acuity course disease . Onset symptoms varies extend PXE-associated finding . In past effective treatment disease 's ocular complication . Recent study limit number patient CNV treat intravitreal injection bevacizumab , antagonist target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , show preservation function regression CNV . An increase visual acuity report subset patient . Bevacizumab humanize antibody ranibizumab fragment . This trial initiate order investigate effect ranibizumab functional outcome measure preservation visual acuity well morphological outcome measure regression CNV angiography . The safety tolerability ranibizumab investigate well . As tested large number patient suffer age-related macular degeneration rare significant side effect adverse event report , good safety profile assume . The study conduct non-randomized , uncontrolled prospective set one center . Patients receive monthly injection period one year .</detailed_description>
