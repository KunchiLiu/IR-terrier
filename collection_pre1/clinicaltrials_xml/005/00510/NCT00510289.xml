	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy sorafenib patient Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) . Eligible subject receive Sorafenib administer 400mg orally twice day , give day 1-28 28-day cycle . Patients evaluate hematological response 2 cycle every 3 cycle thereafter maximum 5 year study entry . If patient achieves complete response may receive additional 6 cycle therapy beyond documentation complete response unless unacceptable toxicity occur . For patient partial response , hematological improvement stable disease continue treatment relapse , progression disease , unacceptable toxicity occur .</brief_summary>
