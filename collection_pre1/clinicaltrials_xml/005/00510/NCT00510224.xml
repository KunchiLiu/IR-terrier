	<brief_summary>This open label , single center Phase II trial Sandostatin LAR patient hormone refractory prostate cancer . Patients receive Sandostatin LAR 30 mg intramuscularly every 28 day . Patients treated time disease progression , unacceptable toxicity withdrawal consent . The study require 27 evaluable patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sandostatin Patients With Androgen Independent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To evaluate change prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) patient androgen independent prostate cancer treat Sandostatin LAR . Secondary Objective : To evaluate effect Sandostatin LAR circulating level Insulin Growth Factor-1 Insulin Growth Factor Binding Protein 1 . To evaluate safety Sandostatin LAR patient population . To evaluate pre versus post treatment mitogenic effect serum derive subject prostate cancer compare pretreatment serum . Patients androgen independent prostate cancer bone visceral metastasis select trial patient population likely symptoms disease rapid progression would suggest need chemotherapy . Additionally , give preclinical data suggest IGF-1 expression signal occurs concomitantly onset androgen independent growth , felt test `` early '' androgen independent state warrant . This trial consistent overall goal develop IGF-1 targeted therapy patient disease progression lower disease burden .</detailed_description>
