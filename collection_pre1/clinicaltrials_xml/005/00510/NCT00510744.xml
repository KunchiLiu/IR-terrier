	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Bypass upper GI tract bariatric surgery result suppression pancreatic function result maldigestion malabsorption . In study measure pancreatic secretion previously obese gastric bypass patient excessive weight loss . If malabsorption associate diminished pancreatic secretion , test 3 month period whether supplementation enzyme supplement prevent weight loss .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pancreatic Enzymes Restore Digestive Function Malnourished Gastric Bypass Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity reach epidemic proportion USA Europe , increase world-wide . Morbid obesity ( BMI &gt; 40kg/m2 ) usually resistant medical dietary therapy surgical treatment result permanent loss excess weight . The popular technique today Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure result weight loss approximately 95 lb per year 2/3 loss excess weight 2 year ( 7-9 ) . Weight loss occur 2 reason : first volume stomach reduce , second , duodenum first part jejunum bypass result malabsorption . Although patient tolerate procedure well level weight loss close ideal body weight , subpopulation patient continue lose weight , become progressively malnourish , necessitate reversal surgery . To date , study investigate happens pancreatic function obese patient follow bypass surgery , understand physiology pancreatic stimulation , likely pancreas atrophy intestinal phase pancreatic stimulation bypass inhibitory ileal brake perpetually stimulate . In follow study plan investigate whether patient excessive weight loss bypass surgery develop malabsorption due bypass upper GI tract also impair pancreatic enzyme secretion result chronic activation ileal brake mechanism . Up 20 post-bariatric surgery ( Roux-en-Y ) patient excessive continued weight loss screen fat absorption loss pancreatic secretion . Those loss &gt; 20 % fat absorption treat home pancreatic enzyme supplement 3 month period ass weight stabilization gain . After 3 month , fat absorption pancreatic stimulation test repeat patient enzyme supplementation determine whether fat digestion absorption improve baseline .</detailed_description>
