	<brief_summary>Results CP good patient treat early onset disease respect late CP . To date , early McR rate imatinib clearly high low intermediate risk versus high risk ( 88 84 % versus 65 % ) . High dose imatinib , show phase I-III trial may offer possibility increase response rate patient belong risk category .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploratory Study IMATINIB High Dose Intermediate Risk Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Chronic Phase</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II multicenter , open-label study design investigate efficacy ( hematological response , cytogenetic response molecular response ) feasibility ( tolerance , compliance safety ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate ( formerly STI 571 , GLIVECÔ , Novartis Pharma ) high dose ( 800 mg/daily ) ( serial number protocol ICSG/CML/021 ) patient Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) chronic phase ( CP ) previously untreated , intermediate Sokal risk . With aIFN , response ( HR CgR ) significantly influenced disease phase , CP patient , risk . aIFN induces rare short live HR CgR ( degree ) late CP particularly accelerate blastic phase . Moreover , CP patient Sokal 's risk influence significantly probability obtain MCgR aIfaIFN . As far survival , aIFN even CCgR patient , long term survival signifcantly influence risk . The European investigator Interferon CML ( EICML ) collect information response survival 317 complete cytogenetic responder IFN . The 10 year survival whole patient population 75 % , stratification risk , significant difference 10 year survival rate find favour low risk patient ( 89 % ) compare intermediate risk ( 70 % ) high risk patient ( 54 % ) ( low vs high risk p 0.0001 ; intermediate v high p 0.003 , log-rank test ) . Long term survival data still lack imatinib . However , already show disease phase influence efficacy imatinib CML : response ( HR particularly CgR ) good CP versus accelerate blastic phase . Results CP good patient treat early onset disease respect late CP . To date , early McR rate imatinib clearly high low intermediate risk versus high risk ( 88 84 % versus 65 % ) . Two score system available disease risk evaluation , Sokal Euro . Sokal risk base chemotherapy treat patient Euro risk base aIFN trated patient : know date one score system apply imatinib treat patient . Moreover , Sokal system apply stratify patient risk large clinical trial imatinib CML last 3 year consequently , Sokal score employed present trial . Study objectives Primary : To determine rate complete cytogenetic response 12 month adult patient previously untreated intermediate Sokal risk CML treat imatinib 800 mg/daily Secondary : To determine : 1 . The rate major cytogenetic response 6 12 month . 2 . The kinetic cytogenetic response 6 12 month 3 . The duration complete cytogenetic response . 4 . The rate duration hematologic response . 5 . The degree timing molecular response 6 . The time accelerate blast crisis overall survival 7 . The safety tolerability treatment .</detailed_description>
