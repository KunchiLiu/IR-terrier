	<brief_summary>The purpose study well understand woman survive cancer relate illness later develop diabetes , problem cholesterol , problem may lead heart disease . Because problem may relate treatment total body irradiation stem cell transplant , investigator compare rate obesity , cholesterol problem , diabetes woman treat total body irradiation stem cell transplant woman . The amount location fat store abdomen important overall weight total body fat development diabetes cholesterol problem . In general , fat store several area abdomen : around organ ( visceral fat ) , skin ( subcutaneous fat ) , liver ( liver fat ) . People high amount fat around organ ( visceral fat ) , even normal weight , likely become diabetic high cholesterol . The amount fat area measure abdominal magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . In study , investigator use blood test , height , weight , waist circumference , blood pressure measurement , abdominal MRI evaluate several risk factor heart disease , include cholesterol problem , diabetes pre-diabetes , elevate blood pressure , increase abdominal fat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abdominal Obesity Cardiovascular Risk Factors Women Who Survived Cancer Related Illness Following Total Body Irradiation Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We enroll 60 female participant study . From population interest , female cancer survivor ( woman treat related illness ) treat TBI prior SCT , enroll 30 participant , 10 follow cancer group : acute lymphoblastic leukemia , acute myeloid leukemia , chronic myeloid leukemia . We interested determine outcome adult survivor complete growth time study yet young age woman generally begin develop insulin resistance dyslipidemia general population . For reason , enroll woman 18 - 49 year age time study .</detailed_description>
