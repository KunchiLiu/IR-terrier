	<brief_title>The Ability Of The PD2i Cardiac Analyzer To Predict Risk Of Ventricular Tachyarrhythmic Events</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The annual incidence sudden cardiac death United States recently estimate 450,000 . Most patient die ventricular tachyarrhythmias . Currently , limited ability predict reliably patient risk event . Implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICDs ) highly effective treat arrhythmia cause sudden death . Multiple clinical trial demonstrate efficacy ICDs primary prevention sudden death complete , lead relaxation selection criterion use , therefore potentially large expansion pool patient eligible device . This major economic implication health care system , lead need well prospective identification patient high risk sudden death . The existence beat-to-beat change heart rate , term heart rate variability HRV ) , long recognize physiologist . However , past 15 year , determine HRV random phenomenon influence brain autonomic nervous system . Promising work analysis HRV may provide mean predict patient risk sudden death . HRV analysis utilizes mathematical modeling ECG data gain insight subtle variation heartbeat pattern occur beat-to-beat . The development system could better identify patient risk arrhythmic event would significant impact clinical economical field . This study test software develop Vicor Technologies potentially identify patient risk arrhythmic event . It work generic digital-electrocardiogram ( ECG ) device , would normally used technical personnel routine care outpatient .</detailed_description>
