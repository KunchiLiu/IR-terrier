	<detailed_description>This phase II study use combination bortezomib , rituximab , fludarabine , mitoxantrone dexamethasone . The combination give 28 day cycle . In addition patient receive Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia ( PCP ) prophylaxis Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( TMP/Sulfa ) equivalent agent . On day 4 physician option start granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( GCSF ) , granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GMCSF ) , pegylated GCSF . All patient receive least one dose drug evaluate toxicity . Patients treat agent least 2 cycle consider eligible evaluation response . The chemotherapy dose continue evidence disease progression , second recurrence unacceptable toxicity , maximum 8 course therapy .</detailed_description>
