	<brief_title>Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccine HIV1 Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I/II , open label , single-arm , single-site clinical trial design evaluate safety antiviral activity ApB DC vaccine , therapeutic vaccine derive autologous dendritic cell load autologous HIV-1 infect apoptotic cell . The study conduct three phase . The first pre-vaccination phase include study entry , isolation autologous virus , initiation antiretroviral therapy . Once patient 's viral load suppress undetectable level ( &lt; 50 copies/mL ) sufficient virus isolate , second phase begin . This include leukapheresis order harvest monocytes lymphocyte necessary vaccine preparation . Three vaccine dos administer subcutaneously every week . Six week last vaccination , third phase , analytic treatment interruption ( ATI ) phase , begin . A fourth , booster dose vaccine give two week start treatment interruption . The treatment interruption continue twelve week primary HIV provider decide whether antiretroviral therapy restart . CD4 viral load closely monitor throughout study especially treatment interruption . Follow-up continue 24 week 12-week treatment interruption .</detailed_description>
