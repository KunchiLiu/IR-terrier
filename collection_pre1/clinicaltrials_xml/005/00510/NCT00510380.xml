	<brief_summary>This study carry discover baby restrict growth womb subject specific fetal programming predispose metabolic syndrome ( diabetes , hypertension , heart disease ) adulthood.We elect first study condition Chinese population Singapore eventual plan study ethnic group . This important understanding molecular basis adult-onset disease diabetes , identify child risk develop disease future target specific strategy intervention disease prevention . Intrauterine fetal programming effect epigenetic change similar previously identify animal study . The epigenetic marker find growth restrict Chinese pregnancy local population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fetal growth restriction associate accelerated postnatal weight gain increase obesity risk later life.International epidemiological data suggest phenomenon fetal program link poor intrauterine growth adult disease , primarily type II diabetes , obesity metabolic syndrome , condition increasingly common Singapore . Suboptimal intrauterine environmental condition postulate affect fetal development effect developmental plasticity epigenetic process . These effect manifest poor glucose resistance , insulin resistance , obesity cardiovascular disease later life . There increase animal data support model . The aim study determine epigenetic marker metabolic syndrome present select Chinese pregnancy Singapore . Hypothesis : Intrauterine fetal programming effect epigenetic change similar previously identify animal study . The epigenetic marker find growth restrict Chinese pregnancy local population . Methodology Umbilical cord cord blood collect twenty unequivocally growth-restricted Chinese pregnancy twenty appropriately-grown Chinese pregnancy . DNA extract tissue subject custom-made DNA methylation array probe specific change 262 candidate gene important fetal endocrine metabolic control . This do use either methylation array Sequenorn 2 DNA extract identify Epigen academic consortium Liggins Institute UK collaborator . Anthropometric data collect infant birth , subsequently 3,6,12,18 24 month seek differential measure program . Application The discovery biomarkers indicate shift developmental trajectory important need developmental programming research . Birth weight alone valid measure . Biomarkers predictive later obesity metabolic syndrome invaluable formulate preventive strategy disease .</detailed_description>
