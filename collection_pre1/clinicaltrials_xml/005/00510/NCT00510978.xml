	<brief_summary>All u million bacteria live gut . These bacteria important health provide u protection infection gut , allow u gain extra nutritional value food eat help immune system . Changes balance many bacteria make u vulnerable infection within outside gut . Certain bacteria may also directly associate disease gut . Research doctor scientist relationships bacteria normally find gut certain disease gut help develop food supplement therapies treat disease . This study involve research usefulness safety two probiotic product maintain remission Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis . Approximately 360 patient Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis Ireland , Finland Spain involve study .

	<detailed_description>There grow body evidence enteric bacterial flora contribute pathogenesis inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ; Crohn 's disease Ulcerative Colitis ) ( Targan S Shanahan F Inflammatory Bowel Disease : From Bench Bedside , Williams Wilkins 1994 ) . It recently find patient suffer active Crohn 's disease significantly less recoverable bifidobacteria faeces compare healthy individual . This reduction bifidobacteria number observe directly correlate decreased level B-D-galactosidase production activity ( Favier C et al . Dig Dis Sci 1997 ; 42:817-822 ) . B-D-galactosidase enzyme produce bifidobacteria . These result support suggestion propose study ( Bartram HP et al . Am J Clin Nutr 1994 ; 59:428-432 ) strain bifidobacteria may play important role maintain balance healthy intestinal microflora . In Crohn 's disease , extensive clinical evidence indicate importance continuity faecal stream disease recurrence . Ingestion bifidobacteria improve gastrointestinal transit . In elderly individual , mild constipation least partially correct consumption milk ferment bifidobacteria ( Seki M et al . Nutr Food 1978 ; 4:379-387 ) . In addition , colonic transit time woman significantly accelerate sigmoid colon follow consumption milk ferment bifidobacteria sp . yoghurt culture ( Grimaud JC et al . Gastroenterol Clin Biol 1993 ; 17 : A127 ) , traditional yoghurt culture alone ( Grimaud JC et al . Les bact_ries lactiques , 1994 ; 406 ) . Several genetically engineer 'knock ' transgenic animal model IBD report role enteric flora directly demonstrate compare animal raise germ free versus conventional facility . For example , gastrointestinal Crohn's-like inflammation occur interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) deficient mouse attenuate animal keep germ free environment becomes pronounce widespread switch conventional facility . ( Kuhn R et al . Cell 1993 ; 75:263-274 ) . The mucosal inflammation IL-10 deficient mouse report reduced feeding animal preparation lactobacillus ( Madsen K et al Gastroenterology 1997 ; 112 : A1030 ) , result subsequently confirm UCC-based research group also report consumption Lactobacillus salivarius UCC118 reduce cancer incidence ( O'Mahony et al.2001 ) . Studies complete rat demonstrate ingestion bifidobacteria suppress aberrant crypt focus ( early preneoplastic lesion ) formation colon ( Kulkarni N Reddy B. Proc Soc Experim Biol Med 1994 ; 207:278-283 ) addition significant decrease colon tumor incidence number tumor present ( Singh J et al . Carcinogenesis 1997 ; 18:833-841 ) . Background Preliminary data : Several probiotic strain lactic acid bacteria Bifidobacterium probiotic strain develop UCC . Lactobacillus salivarius UCC118 chosen probiotic potential base vitro activity several pathogen several property include acid/bile tolerance . In addition , preliminary trial , approve UCC Ethics Committee already conduct 80 human volunteer show either milk yoghurt may use vehicle delivery Lactobacillus salivarius UCC118 gastrointestinal tract equal efficacy alter gut flora apparent colonisation . An abstract , base study submit American Gastroenterological Association full manuscript submit publication . Furthermore , administration Lactobacillus UCC118 20 patient relapse Crohn 's disease six week period result report consumption probiotic improve patient quality life , fact , case patient avoid requirement steroid use ( McCarthy et al. , Submitted ) . Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 choose probiotic potential base several physiological property include acid/bile tolerance . In addition , preliminary trial complete UCC probiotic research group , collaboration UCLA School Medicine ( Division Digestive Diseases ) , show Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 combination Lactobacillus salivarius UCC118 Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 may prove effective beneficially alter gut flora inflammatory disease mouse model alleviate symptom IBD colonise mouse . An abstract , base study submit American Gastroenterological Association full manuscript preparation . The primary aim study determine whether ingestion probiotic preparation ( contain Lactobacillus salivarius subsp . salivarius UCC118 Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 ) help maintenance remission patient Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis period one year ( i.e. , delay onset relapse ) . Secondary aim include evaluation immunological biochemical parameter immuno-inflammatory response assessment faecal flora patient consume probiotic control product .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Crohn 's Disease : Patients must clinical relapse CDAI score &gt; 150 . Probiotic consumption must start within 2 week commence steroid use . To achieve remission , administration steroid patient must follow guideline : Start dose 40 mg per day , Taper daily dose 5 mg per week every 12 week 40 mg 20 mg. Reduce thereafter 20 mg 0 mg ensure dosage reduce 0 mg end week 12 . Patients must take 5ASA . Inclusion Criteria Ulcerative Colitis : Patients must within one month enter remission follow documented episode relapse ( despite use 5ASA ) . Remission define patient experience &lt; 3 bowel movement ( without frank/gross blood ) per day &gt; 3 day 7 steroid include topical steroid . Patients may receive treatment involve 5ASA 5ASP . However , dose may vary study . Age patient 75 year exclude . Be pregnant , desire become pregnant study period . Patients clinically significant immunodeficiency ( quantitative immunoglobulin level perform entry trial ) . Patients consider poor clinical attendee unlikely reason able comply trial . Concomitant Drug usage Patients may receive treatment 6Mercaptopurine , Azothioprine cyclosporin . Patients may receive treatment involve experimental drug . Patients antibiotic within previous month likely require antibiotic trial period exclude . Previous surgery patient exclude undergone resection one ( 1 ) metre bowel past . Patients undergone less extensive surgical resection bowel eligible provide objective ( endoscopic radiological ) evidence recurrence . Malignancy concomitant endstage organ disease .</criteria>
