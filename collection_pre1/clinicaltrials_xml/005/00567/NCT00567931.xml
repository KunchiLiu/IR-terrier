	<brief_title>1-Methyl-D-Tryptophan Treating Patients With Metastatic Refractory Solid Tumors That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity , safety , pharmacokinetics escalate dos 1-methyl-d-tryptophan ( 1-MT ) , competitive inhibitor enzyme indoleamine 2 , 3-dioxygenase ( IDO ) , patient advance malignancy . II . To establish maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) maximally biological effective dose ( MBED ) 1-MT future phase II III trial . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess ratio kynurenine tryptophan patient blood sample mean assess effect 1MT vivo IDO activity . II . To ascertain ability 1-MT decrease number T-regulatory cell thereby allow immune system target tumor antigens effectively . III . To analyze IDO expression different tumor type IDO immunohistochemical stain paraffin-preserved specimen . IV . To perform high performance liquid chromatography patient urine sample assess 1-MT clear renally . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral 1-methyl-d-tryptophan ( 1-MT ) twice daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood urine sample assess characterize pharmacokinetics 1-MT renal clearance rate high performance liquid chromatography , measure tryptophan kynurenine level functional assay , measure response regulatory CD4+ CD25+ T cell intracellular stain flow cytometry . Paraffin-embedded tissue sample analyze indoleamine 2 , 3-dioxygenase ( IDO ) expression immunohistochemical staining . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
