	<brief_summary>- The inflammatory process lead development asthma may present onset asthma symptom cause certain degree airway hyperresponsiveness . Without treatment may induce irreversible airway structural change associate permanent change airway function , persistent airway hyperresponsiveness lead development asthma symptom . - Atopic subject asymptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness first degree relative history asthma high risk develop symptomatic asthma . Early treatment airway inflammation predispose subject `` borderline `` mild airway hyper-responsiveness could prevent development asthma symptom , reduce even normalize airway responsiveness . - In mild asthmatic subject ( bronchodilator need &lt; thrice week ) , early anti-inflammatory treatment lead `` normalisation `` airway responsiveness significant number subject prevent need subsequent regular therapy . This particularly true show blood/sputum eosinophilia . Objectives : To compare perception bronchoconstriction , pulmonary function airway inflammation subject mild symptomatic asthma asymptomatic asymptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness Methods : To compare influence inhaled fluticasone propionate 250 mcg/day 3 month follow 100 mcg/day 9 month airway inflammation methacholine responsiveness double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study include non-smoking atopic subject mild asthma asymptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Evaluate change airway hyperresponsiveness inflammatory marker blood sputum population study follow 3-month course fluticasone 250 µg per day follow 9-month course fluticasone 1000 µg per day ( supper ) compare placebo measure regular basis two year period . - This study include : 1 . A baseline evaluation period 2 week start 3-month treatment period follow 9-month treatment period . 2 . Treatment double-blinded , randomize , parallel design . 3 . A follow-up period one year . Optional : Bronchoscopies bronchial biopsy sampling perform tratment subgroup subject determine influence corticosteroid treatment airway inflammation remodelling .</detailed_description>

Asymptomatic AHR patient past present symptom intermittent dyspnea wheezing , chronic cough phlegm production define negative response European community respiratory health survey ( ECRHS ) questionnaire . They also never experience symptom similar induced methacholine challenge ( misinterpretation asthma symptom ) . Subjects mild intermittent symptom asthma symptom less twice week last 3 month . They , however , demonstrate variable airflow obstruction accord Canadian asthma consensus criterion . They require asthma medication least occasionnally within last year . 4 .
