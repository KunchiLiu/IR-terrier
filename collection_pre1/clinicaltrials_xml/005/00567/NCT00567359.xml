	<brief_summary>In research study erlotinib give eligible participant whose lung cancer remove surgery . Eligible patient adenocarcinoma , type non-small lung cancer , must 1 follow characteristic : female , Asian Pacific Rim descent and/or never smoker . The potential participant 's tumor examine Epidermal growth factor ( EGFR ) mutation . EGFR protein overexpressed non-small cell lung cancer . Some EGFR find specific mutation participant must one mutation tumor . Erlotinib block protein may control tumor growth increase survival . Previous research show erlotinib effective people specific mutation EGFR .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Erlotinib pill take daily participant may continue receive erlotinib two year , long cancer return experience unacceptable side effect . - While participant receive erlotinib , ask return clinic study visit monitor status disease general health . For first 5 month erlotinib , return clinic monthly . After return clinic every three month .</detailed_description>
