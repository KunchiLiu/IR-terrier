	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine `` intentional act '' improve treatment response patient nonfluent aphasia . The treatment involve name picture say member category . The `` intentional act '' require initiating picture name category member trial left-hand movement sequence . Nonfluent aphasia disorder language production patient damage brain 's language system trouble initiate maintain spoken communication . All patient participate study take part functional MRI scan determine treatment affect brain system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treating Intention In Aphasia : Neuroplastic Substrates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new treatment manipulate intention substrate language production `` nonfluent '' aphasia patient develop . The intention component involve initiate word-finding trial complex left-hand movement . The study address ( 1 ) whether intention manipulation ( complex left-hand movement ) make unique contribution treatment outcome ( 2 ) whether intention manipulation help shift word production mechanism leave right frontal lobe . All study participant take part functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan word-finding treatment 3-month follow-up measure change lateralization frontal lobe activity word finding . Only patient substantial degree leave frontal activity pre-treatment fMRI scan participate . There three specific aim : ( 1 ) determine repetitive initiation word production complex left-hand movement lead increase right-hemisphere lateralization frontal activity change attribute intention component treatment , ( 2 ) determine whether activity posterior perisylvian cortex entrain right frontal activity show great increase right-hemisphere lateralization pre- post-treatment fMRI intention component include treatment , ( 3 ) determine whether onset hemodynamic response ( HDRs ) right motor/premotor cortex become closely associated temporal onset participant ' spoken response across treatment intention component include treatment . If successful , treatment provide new treatment vehicle increase language function patient `` nonfluent '' aphasia .</detailed_description>
