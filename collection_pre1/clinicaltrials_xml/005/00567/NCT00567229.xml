	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Lenalidomide may stop growth multiple myeloma block blood flow cancer . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving lenalidomide together rituximab may effective treatment multiple myeloma . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect give lenalidomide together rituximab see well work treat patient recurrent refractory multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Rituximab Treating Patients With Recurrent and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine safety efficacy , determine response rate ( complete response [ CR ] + near CR + partial response ) , lenalidomide administer rituximab patient relapse and/or refractory CD20+ multiple myeloma . Secondary - To assess effect regimen patient lymphocyte subset ( T , B , NK cell ) peripheral blood bone marrow sample patient . - To perform detailed phenotypic analysis NK cell patient blood bone marrow sample baseline post-treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral lenalidomide daily day 1-21 . Treatment lenalidomide repeat every 28 day least 4 course . Patients also receive rituximab IV weekly week 2-5 week 13 . Patients stable disease receive rituximab every 8 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Peripheral blood sample collect baseline , course 2 4 . Samples examine flow cytometry lymphocyte subset analysis ( T- , B- , NK-cell percentages absolute number ) NK-cell phenotyping ( CD16 , CD56 , NKG2D expression ) . Samples also examine immunologic assay isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cell . Bone marrow aspirate sample also collect baseline course 2 . Bone marrow mononuclear cell isolate evaluated CD138+ plasma cell selection , ex vivo antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assay , bone marrow lymphocyte subset analysis . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
