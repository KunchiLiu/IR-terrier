	<detailed_description>This study extension ongoing clinical trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT 00308997 ) initiate 2006 . The primary objective ongoing clinical trial ( hereafter call `` parent trial '' ) determine efficacy rTMS curb auditory hallucination deliver part leave temporal lobe call Wernicke 's area correspond region right temporal lobe . The parent trial appear show robust effect active rTMS compare effect sham stimulation . However , observed response follow active rTMS often incomplete . Moreover , case subsequent return symptom 1 6 month trial end . We consequently initiate trial patient participate parent trial demonstrate incomplete response subsequent return symptom may return receive additional active rTMS . We hypothesize efficacy suppressive rTMS enhance direct simultaneously right/left Wernicke 's area ( site use parent trial ) well second site locate opposite middle temporal cortex . Roughly half subject re-enrollment randomized receive active rTMS right/left Wernicke 's area plus active rTMS opposite hemisphere middle temporal region , half subject randomize receive active rTMS right/left Wernicke 's area plus sham rTMS opposite hemisphere middle temporal region . The position middle temporal region determine two recently complete brain imaging study auditory hallucination suggest activation sit trigger auditory hallucination . The two-position design allow u determine active rTMS deliver middle temporal cortex superior amplify efficacy active rTMS target Wernicke 's area reduce auditory hallucination sham stimulation site . The re-enrollment protocol utilize two rTMS device simultaneously one directly trigger . We add third arm protocol ( 3/2012 ) intervention describe Arm 1 provide enrollee , randomization comparison Arm 2 pursued . The primary purpose Arm conduct fMRI neuroimaging study prior subsequent rTMS intervention . Our intent ascertain change regional brain activation connectivity robustly predict level improvement auditory hallucination elicit bilateral rTMS assess primary outcome variable . This combined fMRI/rTMS study provide critical new insight neurobiological basis auditory hallucination .</detailed_description>
