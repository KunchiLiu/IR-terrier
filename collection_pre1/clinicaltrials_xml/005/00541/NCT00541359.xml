	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , topotecan hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bortezomib together topotecan hydrochloride may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose topotecan hydrochloride give together bortezomib treat patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Topotecan Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety feasibility combine PS-341 topotecan patient advance solid tumor malignancy . II . To define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) topotecan administer combination fix dose PS-341 described toxicity dose study . III . To evaluate pharmacokinetics topotecan give combination PS-341 MTD . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To perform laboratory correlative study patient tissue investigate potential predictor response . OUTLINE : PART I ( complete 09/06/06 ; patient enrol study 09/06/06 enrol part II ) : Patients receive escalate dos topotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 follow 6 hour later bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Treatment repeat every 21 day least 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PART II : Patients receive bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 follow 6 hour later escalate dos topotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day least 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In part study , patient achieve response may receive additional course treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
