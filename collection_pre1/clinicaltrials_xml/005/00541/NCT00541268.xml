	<brief_summary>Primary objective : The primary objective study determine efficacy ICD therapy compare control endpoint death cause . Secondary objective : The secondary objective study determine ICD therapy reduces sudden death . Study design : Randomized , unblinded , control , parallel two group trial .

Summary Subject Eligibility Criteria : Patients clinical heart failure , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≤ 35 % , non-ischemic etiology NT-proBNP 200 pg/ml . Patients NYHA class IV randomise also fulfil criterion biventricular pacemaker . Control group : Patients receive standard therapy heart failure include ACE-inhibitor/Angiotensin-Receptor-Blocker Betablocker unless tolerate . Aldosterone antagonism optional . Study Duration : The study comprise screen period 2 year , follow treatment phase minimum 36 month . Randomisation : After fulfil eligibility criterion , subject randomize 1:1 receive ICD implantation continue usual control . Randomisation stratify accord treatment biventricular pacemaker . Treatment : After randomisation patient allocate ICD treatment receive fast possible preferably within 2 week ( late 4 week ) . The ICD program anti-tachycardia pacing shock therapy . Assessments : Deaths hospitalisation heart failure , stroke arrhythmias record throughout study duration . Statistical Considerations : Median lifetime control group expect 5 year . A p-value 5 % ( 2-sided ) require significance together power least 80 % . With relative risk reduction 25 % sample size 812 patient total required . In order allow cross-over sample size 1000 plan .

	<brief_title>Efficacy Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Patients With Non-ischemic Systolic Heart Failure Mortality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Title : A DANish randomized , control , multicenter study assess efficacy Implantable cardioverter defibrillator patient non-ischemic Systolic Heart failure mortality . Indication : Prevention mortality patient risk sudden death . Primary objective : The primary objective study determine efficacy ICD therapy compare control endpoint death cause . Secondary objective : The secondary objective study determine ICD therapy reduces cardiovascular death well sudden death . Study design : Randomized , unblinded , control , parallel two group trial . Primary endpoint : Time death cause . Sample size : In total , 1000 patient 500 receive ICD 500 patient constitute control group . Summary Subject Eligibility Criteria : Patients clinical heart failure , leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≤ 35 % , non-ischemic etiology NT-proBNP 200 pg/ml . Patients NYHA class IV randomise also fulfil criterion biventricular pacemaker . Control group : Patients receive standard therapy heart failure include ACE-inhibitor/Angiotensin-Receptor-Blocker Betablocker unless tolerate . Aldosterone antagonism optional . Study Duration : The study comprise screen period 2 year , follow treatment phase minimum 36 month . Screening Randomisation : After sign informed consent , screen include medical history , vital sign , physical exam , blood chemistry , haematology , NT-proBNP . After fulfil eligibility criterion , subject randomize 1:1 receive ICD implantation continue usual control . Randomisation stratify accord treatment biventricular pacemaker . Treatment : After randomisation patient allocate ICD treatment receive fast possible preferably within 2 week ( late 4 week ) . The ICD program anti-tachycardia pacing shock therapy . Assessments : Deaths hospitalisation heart failure , stroke arrhythmias record throughout study duration . An Endpoint Classification Committee adjudicate hospitalization death causality . An independent Data Monitoring Committee periodically review mortality data throughout study . Statistical Considerations : Median lifetime control group expect 5 year . A p-value 5 % ( 2-sided ) require significance together power least 80 % . With relative risk reduction 25 % sample size 812 patient total required . In order allow cross-over sample size 1000 plan . As event rate lower expect steer committee decide prolong follow-up increase sample size slightly 1150 patient . Secondly , steer comittee decide add cardiovascular death secondary outcome . Primary Endpoint Analysis : The principal analysis primary endpoint ( time death cause ) employ intent-to-treat principle use survival analysis . For treatment group , Kaplan-Meier curve estimate , graphically display , compare use logrank test . A covariate-adjusted analysis primary endpoint use Cox proportional hazard model perform supportive analysis . The hazard ratio correspond 95 % confidence interval estimate . Subjects withdraw study early ( withdrawal consent ) follow potential development primary endpoint . Subjects complete study experience composite event censor . Secondary Endpoint Analysis : All time-to-event secondary endpoint analyze similarly primary endpoint . Sample Size : Hazard rate estimate placebo ICD group use subject variety database ( include Echos database publication Definite ) . Assuming 24-month enrollment period 36 month follow-up period ( result 5-year study minimum treatment period 3 year approximately median survival time 60 month ) , total 812 subject provide 80 % power 2-sided significance level 5 % detect reduction hazard 25 % . Safety Summary : The subject incidence adverse event tabulate group . Adverse event related ICD implantation summarize . During trial inappropriate shock summarize . Data Monitoring Committee : An independent Data Monitoring Committee consist member relevant expertise assemble prior study commencement . This committee periodically review safety data . Endpoint Classification Committee : An external Endpoint Classification Committee adjudicate death sudden non-sudden throughout study .</detailed_description>
