	<brief_title>Study Myopia Prevention Children With Low Concentration Atropine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence rate myopia rise rapidly several Asian country . A prevalence survey conduct 1995 11178 school child Taiwan 12 percent six year old 84 percent teenager 16 18 year . Among , twenty percent high myope . While United States Europe prevalence rate old adult 20 % 50 % . The rate progression myopia high young child , average age stabilization myopia approximately 16 years.The onset myopia may occur relatively young age , lead high risk high myopia ( myopia least 6.0 diopter ) adulthood . High myopia associate potentially blinding complication . Therefore , prevention myopia progression important Taiwan , especially young child . There evidence atropine eyedrops retard myopia progression three randomize clinical trial . It believe atropine act muscarinic receptor locate sclera unknown mechanism retard elongation rate axial length . However , possible long-term side effect cataract formation retinal toxicity , largely unknown . Photophobia daily life , accommodation difficulty decrease acceptance atropine usage compliance . There evidence rate axial elongation eyeball different pre-myopic stage myopic stage . Therefore , use low concentration atropine eyedrops myopia development . Maybe prevent abnormal axial length elongation low dosage atropine eyedrop compare daily use atropine eyedrop true myopia stage . Clinical study conduct randomize control trial . 60 school-aged child recruit ( Age 7 12 year ) . All pre-myopia ( spherical equivalent +0.50 -0.75 ) cycloplegic refraction . Visual acuity naked eye 0.6 . None tropia , amblyopia , eyelid disease , ocular problem . The astigmatism less -1.0D anisometropia less 1.0D . The child randomly assign two group use randomized consent design . The first group use 0.25 % atropine week . The second group keep traditional treatment use 0.5 % tropicamide eyedrop every day . All child complete ophthalmologic examination enrollment . Follow-up examination perform every 3 month 12 month duration . These examination include visual acuity naked eye . Intraocular pressure , refractive status . The cycloplegic refraction axial length measure every 6 month .</detailed_description>
