	<detailed_description>Although prevalence decrease dramatically European country , dental caries remain burden society especially certain group population . For example , 80 % carious lesion diagnose 20 % child . For year , aetiology disease mainly related environmental factor recent data support possibility human genetic contribution . Alteration post- eruptive enamel microstructure due mutation gene cod matrix protein could increase susceptibility enamel caries tooth eruption . The main objective study identify young patient severe caries incidence , occurrence mutation several candidate gene result alteration enamel microstructure could explain high caries susceptibility patient . With aim , carry case- control multicentre European study 250 young patient present several carious lesion 160 young adult totally caries free . Patients systemic enamel pathology amelogenesis imperfecta include study . The study consist 2 visit , 1 : inclusion genetic test base salivary sample 2 : 6 month , communication genetic test result patient parent . The main evaluation criterion find mutation candidate gene result amelogenesis imperfecta phenotype associate severe caries phenotype . If direct relation mutation severe caries phenotype show , classical approach , prevention protocol treatment caries would need reconsider .</detailed_description>
