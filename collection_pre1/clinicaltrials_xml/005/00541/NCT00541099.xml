	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , also work different way kill tumor cell stop grow . Giving bevacizumab together docetaxel may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together docetaxel work treat old patient stage III stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Docetaxel Treating Older Patients With Stage III Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine proportion elderly ( ≥ 75 year age ) patient stage III IV non-small cell lung cancer survive least 6 month treat combination bevacizumab weekly docetaxel . Secondary - To assess progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - To determine response rate patient treat regimen . - To assess toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 docetaxel IV day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment may repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
