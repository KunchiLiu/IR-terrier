Data regard usefulness test child currently limit . Objective ( ) Hypothesis ( e ) : The investigator hypothesize blood-based TB diagnostic test accurately identify child TB infection . In community high rate TB HIV infection , follow specific aim investigate HIV-infected uninfected child : 1. ass agreement TST blood-based diagnostic testing , 2. compare performance TST blood-based diagnostic test standardized history TB exposure , 3. measure impact age , nutritional immune status child 's response blood-based testing , 4. describe factor might modify child 's response testing time , 5 ) examine effect environmental exposure previous vaccination TST , blood-based testing measure immune response TB . Potential Impact : The benefit accurate , rapid diagnostic test TB infection child include 1 ) timely institution treatment TB infection prevent severe disease mortality , 2 ) preclusion diagnosis treatment . Treatment childhood TB infection also prevent future contagious adult disease , thus decrease community transmission . Blood-based diagnostic testing may also able identify child likely become ill follow TB infection . Therefore , blood-based diagnostic test great potential improve TB control health HIV-infected uninfected child , household community .</brief_summary>
