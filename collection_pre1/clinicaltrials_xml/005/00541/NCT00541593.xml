	<detailed_description>Introduction : Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery ( NOTES ) describe new field investigational surgery use endoscope primary operative tool . Multiple animal study utilize similar technique ongoing several institution , include Baystate Medical Center . These multidisciplinary team consist surgeon gastroenterologist collaborate develop safe effective surgical technique via natural orifice route order avoid surgical incision . Pancreatic pseudocysts cavity form typically less sac follow episode acute pancreatitis . These pseudocysts may become infected , may detrimental outcome caused mass effect stomach and/or small intestine . Pseudocysts able drained variety technique , include endoscopically . Chronic pseudocysts often require surgical drainage stomach jejunum may contain solid material drain . Typically , cystgastrostomies cystenterotomies perform utilizing abdominal incision subsequent suture stapling . The medical device company know `` Power Medical Interventions '' computer-powered surgical stapler rest flexible shaft . There subsequent development linear version stapler design gastrointestinal anastomosis utilized research project know `` powered stapler '' . An endoscope would insert mouth , stomach induction general anesthesia . Following insertion endoscope , power stapler pass alongside endoscope help surgeon gastroenterologist ( work team ) see properly place stapler . If connection previously make stomach pseudocyst , stapler maneuver proper position . If connection yet make , do procedure aid endoscopic ultrasound probe pass mouth . Once stapler position , one jaw stapler place pseudocyst , jaw leave stomach . The stapler close fire , create permanent connection two hollow space allow content pseudocyst drain naturally stomach intestine . The stapler endoscope remove anesthesia allow wear . Utilizing technique , surgical incision avoid . Primary Objective : The primary objective study demonstrate Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery ( NOTES ) technique effective standard surgical technique permanent drainage pancreatic pseudocysts . Secondary Objective : The secondary objective research project demonstrate decrease degree pain experience patient undergoing Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery versus traditional method . Hypothesis : Patients undergo Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery treatment pancreatic pseudocyst experience effective treatment less discomfort quicker recovery standard surgical technique . Background : The NOTES team ( surgeon gastroenterologist ) Baystate extensive experience animal work develop novel technique commercially available product . While ever perform cystgastrostomy animal , know animal model simulate pathologic condition . We , however , operate flexible gastrointestinal anastomotic stapler translumenally animal model order prepare procedure . The surgeon team perform human stapled cystgastrostomies , via open laparoscopic approach . A pilot case recently do perform patient continue well . Study Design : There total 10 patient undergoing experimental surgical procedure meeting entry criterion subsequent obtain informed consent . Follow-up endoscopic examination conduct approximately 6 week follow procedure determine success drainage pseudocyst . Longer term follow-up determine patient 's overall condition . These 10 patient compare retrospective review 10 patient compare pseudocyst size , degree pain hospital length stay . The degree pain assess use Wong-Baker Pain Scale . The retrospective series match cohort base size pseudocyst age comorbidities patient . Safety Monitoring : Due novelty procedure , safety information monitor continuous basis . Should untoward result , study may terminate prematurely , temporarily suspend ass event . In event serious adverse event outcome , IRB notify immediately . Risks Benefits : The anticipated risk associate type surgery include : Bleeding , infection , need open surgery , pancreatic leak , gastric leak , inadequate drainage pseudocyst . A risk specific NOTES approach include trauma oropharynx result bleed infection . The anticipated benefit include decrease amount pain experienced drainage pancreatic pseudocyst , well anticipate decrease length hospital stay . Statistics : A comparison mean perform use numerical value Pain Scale , large diameter pseudocyst , hospital length stay . Data Storage : The data collect kept lock filing cabinet primary investigator 's office . Only PI access file . Enrollment Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Adult ( 18 year old ) patient able provide inform consent surgical procedure 2 . Patients scheduled undergo non-emergent surgical treatment removal pancreatic pseudocyst Enrollment Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Inability provide inform consent 2 . Patients , opinion investigator , would appropriate enrollment experimental research project 3 . Patients deem unstable medical standpoint undergo pancreatic surgery 4 . Pregnancy It anticipate similar type `` natural orifice '' type surgeries future variety procedure multitude reason ( incision , less pain , less time hospital ) . This surgery first kind drainage pancreatic pseudocysts .</detailed_description>
