	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sunitinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well sunitinib work first-line therapy treat patient locally advance metastatic papillary renal cell ( kidney ) cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib First-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Papillary Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine objective tumor response rate patient locally advance metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma treat sunitinib malate . Secondary - To evaluate safety drug patient . - To determine time-to-event variable overall survival , time disease progression , time response , duration response patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sunitinib malate day day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
