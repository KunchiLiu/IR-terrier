	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) scan use detect mantle cell lymphoma colon . Researchers want learn PET/CT scan produce good-quality image and/or find exact location lymphoma body . Primary Objective determine combine CT colonography full body PET scan technically feasible produce diagnostic scan well accurate anatomic coordination detection mantle cell lymphoma involvement colon .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy Testing : A colonoscopy routine test doctor look inner line colon use long , flexible , light tube insert anus . This standard procedure detect mantle cell lymphoma colon . PET/CT Scanning : Because PET/CT scan less invasive colonoscopy , researcher want learn whether PET/CT scan may able use detect mantle cell lymphoma colon . PET/CT scan also consider routine test checking status mantle cell lymphoma . The scan call `` full body '' neck , chest , abdomen ( stomach area ) , pelvis include . In study , participant full-body PET/CT procedure perform like normally would , difference gas pump colon scan . This colon open ( inflate ) study doctor able easily look lesion . The procedure call gas insufflation . ( In standard PET/CT scanning colon , gas insufflation use . ) Study Participation : If agree take part study , begin PET/CT procedure , usual . This mean special substance call fluorodeoxyglucose injected vein , order make tumor visible scan image . About hour later , study doctor prepare colon PET/CT scan performing gas insufflation . To , soft plastic tube insert anus . Carbon dioxide gas automatically pump colon gas correct pressure . If study doctor decides necessary ( example , cramp occurs ) , receive glucagon injection skin order relax colon . Glucagon medication help relax colon decrease cramping . If continue cramping occur , gas turn result immediate relief . This consider routine CT part PET/CT . Administering gas CT similar sensation felt colonoscopy colon also insufflate . After gas insufflation , routine PET/CT scan perform check status disease . You lie stomach first part PET/CT scan back second part . After PET/CT scan , routine colonoscopy perform . You need sign separate consent form colonoscopy , procedure explain detail . Length Study : Your participation study PET/CT scan . Researchers compare result PET/CT scan result colonoscopy . This investigational study . Gas insufflation glucagon FDA approve use CT colonography ( colonoscopy us CT scan ) , typically use screen colon cancer . PET/CT scan FDA approve use check status mantle cell lymphoma . Using PET/CT scan detect mantle cell lymphoma colon , however , investigational . For purpose , time PET/CT scan use research . Up 43 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
