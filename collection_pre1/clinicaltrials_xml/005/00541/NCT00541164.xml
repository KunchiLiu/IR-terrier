	<brief_summary>The object research test effectiveness Coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ10 ) symptoms weakness , fatigue , pain person Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease ( CMT ) .In study also intend examine impact daily supplementation overall quality life.We also interested identify difference serum ratio CoQ10 oxidize reduce form .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Coenzyme Q10 Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CoQ10 integral part electron transport chain mitochondrion , energy production center cell . Within recent year , expand interest potential benefit CoQ10 supplementation variety neuromuscular disease , involve mitochondrial dysfunction , CMT . Daily supplementation may cytoprotective neuroprotective property , may improve symptom weakness , fatigue , pain , well increase quality life ( QOL ) among person CMT . With regard within group comparison hypothesize daily supplementation CoQ10 take 300 milligram wafer twice day 3 month produce statistically significant reduction weakness , fatigue , pain , along significant improvement QOL indicate score standardize physiological scale measure . The addition serum level analysis help contextualize clinical result . We hypothesize ratio oxidize reduce form CoQ10 modify upon supplementation .</detailed_description>
