	<brief_summary>The purpose study well understand genetic susceptibility infection interaction specific genetic polymorphism innate immune receptor microbial fungal organism . The goal study : 1 . Find people likely get severe infection , others . To compare patient leukemia develop severe infection patient develop infection . 2 . Find people likely develop lymphoma others . To compare patient lymphoma people without lymphoma sex similar age ethnic background patient lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Genetic Polymorphisms Innate Immune Response Genes Susceptibility Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A small number patient develop severe infection chemotherapy allogeneic bone marrow transplantation . The ability patient leukemia bone marrow transplantation fight infection decrease . One reason chemotherapy transiently destroy type white blood cell call neutrophil . Neutrophils first line defense body infection . Bone marrow transplant patient may receive edications prevent graft versus host disease . Such medication may decrease ability body fight infection . People respond infection different way . Some may bear gene make likely get certain type infection . Specific gene may affect response different microbe ( pathogen ) . We want find gene normal change lead different response infection . We also want find ability fight infection related way gene work . Responses infection control immune system . Changes gene immune system may alter control infection may make people susceptible type lymphoma The goal study : 1 . Find people likely get severe infection , others . To compare patient leukemia develop severe infection patient develop infection . 2 . Find people likely develop lymphoma others . To compare patient lymphoma people without lymphoma sex similar age ethnic background patient lymphoma . The purpose study well understand genetic susceptibility infection interaction specific genetic polymorphism innate immune receptor microbial fungal organism . To accomplish , blood specimen patient acute myeloid leukemia , RAEB , RAEBT acute lymphocytic leukemia , follicular mantle cell lymphoma recipient allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) collect . We genotype gene innate immune receptor identify genetic polymorphism associate high frequency invasive infection susceptibility lymphoma . All specimen process Infectious Diseases Laboratory MSKCC . RNA extract peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) . Genotyping do genomic DNA cDNA generate RNA RT-PCR . Cell line create PBMCs analyze functional assay responses bacterial fungal product ( cytokine secretion , upregulation cell surface molecule ) . All patient sample include genomic DNA , RNA , cDNA cell line bank Infectious Disease laboratory MSKCC . In order perform study , patient diagnose acute leukemia ask provide blood , permission review medical chart . We collect ( remove prospectively ) data regard risk factor infection , diagnosis infection , response treatment outcome .</detailed_description>
