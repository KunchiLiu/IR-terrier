	<brief_summary>The goal control status asthma change improvement management chronic disease ; many step take achieve asthma control define GINA/NIH guideline . There good result single variable , overall asthma control address different way . Most traditional clinical study provide incomplete assessment disease control , despite good clinical practice . The association inhale corticosteroid ( IC ) long-action beta 2 agonist ( LABA ) already show efficacy reduce asthma symptom , exacerbation cost moderate severe asthma patient well improvement quality life . On hand , even use first line maintenance medication , recommend guideline , asthmatic patient fail obtain total control disease . This lack efficacy , lead u hypothesize , patient fail response , would present chronic fix airway obstruction consequence persistent inflammation airway remodel . This study purpose look adequate composite measure provide indicator overall asthma status accurately meaningfully reflect treatment effectiveness disease control . For , test randomize control trial additional oral corticosteroid treatment could modify spirometric plethysmography value , nasal low airway cytology HRCT ( evaluate small airway ) regularly treat stable asthma patient positive bronchodilator response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inflammatory , Functional Image Composite Measure Define Asthma Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate achievement asthma control status asthmatic patient , regularly treat IC + LABA answer follow question : . Is possible improve pulmonary function ( spirometry plethysmography ) stable asthma patient , regularly treat IC + LABA , positive bronchodilator response , introduction oral steroid ? ii . What relationship among nasal , induce sputum blood cytology , tool observe inflammatory airway expression , control total controlled asthma patient ? What value response oral steroid introduce ? iii . What correlation pulmonary volume airways inflammation evaluate severity control status asthmatic patient , use plethysmography HRCT ? What value response oral steroid introduce ?</detailed_description>
