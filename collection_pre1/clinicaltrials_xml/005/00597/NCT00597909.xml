	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Ammonul® Patients With Grade 3 4 Hepatic Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) reversible neuropsychiatric syndrome see patient liver disease . The pathogenesis HE incompletely understand , several piece evidence identify ammonia key factor development HE . The liver normally detoxify ammonia produce gastrointestinal tract . However , patient cirrhosis , portosystemic shunting allow ammonia bypass liver reach systemic circulation brain . The accumulation ammonia brain , mechanism yet fully define , lead change consciousness , intellectual function , behavior . Ammonul currently approve adjuvant therapy management hyperammonemia associate encephalopathy patient deficiency enzymes urea cycle . Ammonul remove nitrogenous ammonia patient pathways alternative urea cycle . It anticipate patient HE , Ammonul may lead scavenge ammonia alternative biochemical pathway take place tissue liver . This study design test efficacy safety IV Ammonul® treatment acute episode elevate ammonia patient Grade 3 4 HE . Study terminate due lack enrollment business decision .</detailed_description>
