	<detailed_description>Study Objectives Design : Propofol short-acting sedative easily titratable , approve use ventilate patient . The clinical usefulness continuous intravenous infusion Propofol demonstrate management ventilate ICU patient . In addition , short duration action permit repeat neurological assessment carry patient neurotrauma . Despite benefit , Propofol without drawback , include lack analgesic effect , dose dependent lower blood pressure , significant expense . To address issue , PI develop ICU Sedation Protocol combine titrate continuous infusion intravenous morphine sulfate Propofol infusion achieve desire level sedation . This ICU Sedation Protocol approve use Scottsdale Healthcare since 2004 , print copy available ICU nursing station Osborn campus . At present time , ICU Sedation Protocol use regularly two five neurosurgeon care neurotrauma patient Osborn campus . The remain three neurosurgeon prefer use continuous Propofol infusion intermittent dose intravenous morphine sulfate . The purpose study compare clinical utility Propofol sedation without use ICU Sedation Protocol . Patients treat accord attend neurosurgeon preference . No attempt make influence patient 's routine care management . The study compare average hourly infusion rate Propofol administration , well evaluate difficulty neurological assessment , ease wean extubation . This prospective , non-randomized , open treatment protocol open ICU patient Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn . Only patient neurotrauma require intubation eligible enrollment . Patients treat accord consult neurosurgeon preference . No attempt make influence patient 's routine care management , already state . The choice sedation type use ICU Sedation Protocol consult neurosurgeon discretion . Involvement protocol cease continuous intravenous sedation discontinue 24 hour , patient extubated undergoes tracheostomy , transfer ICU .</detailed_description>
