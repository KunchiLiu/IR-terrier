	<brief_summary>The central hypothesis study use less toxic chemotherapy preparative regimen allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation combination T cell depletion alemtuzumab patient high risk hematologic malignancy allow effective control disease improve disease free overall survival compare historical expectation . Specifically , objective estimate toxicity , disease free , progression free , event free , overall survival rate patient treat alemtuzumab T cell deplete , reduce intensity preparative regimen follow allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation ; evaluate immune recovery follow reduce intensity allogeneic immunotherapy ; develop vitro assay allow patient individualize targeted dosing .</brief_summary>

Specifically , objective estimate toxicity , disease free , progression free , event free overall survival rate patient treat alemtuzumab T cell deplete , reduce intensity preparative regimen follow allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation ; evaluate immune recovery follow reduce intensity allogeneic immunotherapy ; develop vitro assay allow patient individualize targeted dosing . The study population HIV negative , adult patient pregnant confirm diagnosis disease ; must Cancer Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ) performance status ( PS ) 0 , 1 , 2 ; must 3-6/6 human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -matched related donor 8/8 ( A , B , C , DRB1 , DQ primary determinant ) good HLA-matched unrelated donor evaluate deem able provide peripheral blood stem cell ( PBPCs ) and/or marrow transplant team . The target population patient high chance progressive lymphoid myelomatous disease , progressive myeloid disease , marrow failure syndromes myeloproliferative disorder .</detailed_description>
