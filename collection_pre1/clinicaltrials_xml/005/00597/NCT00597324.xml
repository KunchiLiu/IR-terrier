	<brief_title>Predictive Value Allen 's Test Result Elective Patients Undergoing Coronary Catheterization Through Radial Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The transfemoral access ( TFA ) , percutaneous Seldinger technique , preferred approach catheterization laboratory worldwide due long history use , large availability several dedicate preform Judkins-type catheter possibility exploit relatively large diameter catheter sheath , necessary complex percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Being relatively deep terminal vessel however , femoral artery percutaneous access site may expose rare ischemic frequent bleed complication occur 3-7 % patient undergoing interventional procedure , especially modern anti-thrombotic drug , include glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blocker clopidogrel . The difficulty obtain stable definitive local haemostasis , even dedicate arterial vascular closure device ( VCD ) employ , make prolonged bed rest TFA necessary majority case result patient discomfort overall increase medical expenditure . In last fifteen year , Campeau 's report successful coronary angiography transradial approach ( TRA ) , radial artery increasingly employed alternative access site diagnostic interventional procedure . The main advantage offer percutaneous TRA represent low incidence relevant vascular access site complication bleed allows early mobilization patient thus early discharge . As bleed complication increasingly recognize strong independent predictor short long-term outcome follow PCI , TRA may prefer access site experience team . Radial artery ( RA ) cannulation , however , carry risk RA occlusion incidence 4.8 % 19 % . This usually consequence , hand receives blood radial ulnar artery ( UA ) extensive collateral channel ; however , patient incomplete palmar arch might adequate communication ulnar radial artery . In patient , potential risk hand ischemia event RA occlusion . A simple bedside test check communication ulnar radial artery modify Allen 's test ( AT ) . Patients abnormal test usually cardiac catheterization perform via femoral artery , thus deny potential advantage transradial cardiac catheterization . In patient undergo coronary angiography , incidence abnormal AT range 6.4 % 27 % . Whether AT predict ischemic complication RA cannulation controversial , center longer exclude patient abnormal AT . However , In 50 patient undergoing coronary angiography screen AT time . Circulation RA , UA , principal artery thumb ( PAT ) , thumb capillary lactate measure 30 min RA occlusion . patient abnormal AT show significantly reduce blood flow thumb increase thumb capillary lactate ( compare patient normal AT ) suggestive ischemia . Based finding , Authors conclude Transradial cardiac catheterization perform patient abnormal AT . Aim RADAR study evaluate whether result Allen 's test consecutive patient undergo transradial coronary catheterization predict occurrence ischemic complication define primarily increase thumb capillary lactate secondarily composite local discomfort and/or procedure , disability instrument arm define perceive ( subjective ) objective muscular weakness , need surgical intervention RA occlusion time within 30 day catheterisation . Bleeding complication also monitor .</detailed_description>
