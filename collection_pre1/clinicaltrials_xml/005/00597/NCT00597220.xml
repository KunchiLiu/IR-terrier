	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Assess Efficacy PUFA Maintenance Sinus Rhythm Persistent Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) impose substantial grow economic burden health care expenditures . In patient persistent AF , fundamentally two way manage arrhythmia : restore maintain sinus rhythm ( rhythm control ) allow AF continue ensure ventricular rate control ( rate control ) . As state , go without say could prevent atrial fibrillation ( AF ) restore maintain sinus rhythm patient suffer persistent AF , without penalty due unwanted effect drug incomplete suppression AF thromboembolic complication , every physician would . Current strategy however , limited achieve desirable goal . In last year grow amount evidence attention regard cardio-protective role Omega 3 fatty acid ( n-3 PUFA ) become progressively clear appeal . Epidemiological study randomize controlled trial confirms role n-3 PUFA reducing cause mortality cardiovascular event mostly patient high cardiovascular risk . These effect seem mediate mostly anti-arrhythmogenic effect . Basic science confirms extend clinical observation regard antiarrhythmogenic effect compound . Recently basic research clinical science suggest role n-3 PUFA prevention treatment supraventricular arrhythmia , particularly AF . The purpose study show addition n-3 PUFA top best recommend therapy improve maintenance normal sinus rhythm patient persistent atrial fibrillation .</detailed_description>
