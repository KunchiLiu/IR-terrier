	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine reduce incidence cognitive dysfunction — difficulty perform certain pencil-paper , memory , finger dexterity think type task call neuropsychometric test — patient adult onset diabetes mellitus ( DM ) undergo surgery carotid artery ( CEA ) . We hypothesize cognitive dysfunction decrease patient type II DM augment cerebral blood flow shunt carotid endarterectomy compare patient Type II DM treat `` conventional '' management shunt place electroencephalogram ( EEG ) indicate cerebral ischemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Based previous clinical study , find patient diabetes mellitus ( DM ) carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) four-fold high incidence cognitive dysfunction , 1 day 1 month surgery , control group elderly diabetic patient spine surgery . We hypothesize increased incidence due sub-cortical ischemia associate clamp ipsilateral carotid artery , intra-operatively rarely see EEG change , significant number embolus upon clamp unclamping carotid artery , new cortical lesion ischemia MRI surgery . In order decrease cognitive dysfunction patient DM , propose randomize either ) shunt place across surgical site assume surgically feasible ii ) treat `` conventional '' management time shunt place unlikely event significant cortical ischemia determine EEG , occur 5 % case . The purpose study determine patient adult-onset diabetes mellitus surgical procedure call carotid endarterectomy benefit increase blood flow brain `` shunt '' . A `` shunt '' tube insert surgical area time carotid artery clamp allow surgeon work bloodless field supplement blood flow brain . Benefit measured surgery compare performance battery cognitive test , test ability perform pencil-paper , memory finger dexterity test , performance surgery . Patients shunt group surgeon time surgical exposure considers technically difficult shunt , shunt insert treat statistically shunt ( intention treat ) . Follow-up evaluation perform 1 day , 1 6 month surgery long-term effect shunt evaluate . Cerebral injury determine two way . First , patient evaluate use battery neuropsychometric test surgery . Patients admit Irving Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) test 1 day , 1 day , 1 6 month surgery . Those coming hospital day surgery , `` Same Day '' , evaluate day surgery . They evaluate 1 day , 1 6 month surgery . Preoperative neurological neuropsychological evaluation perform . The neuropsychometric test intend diagnostic specific neuropsychiatric disorder , rather design demonstrate general neuropsychological pathology . These test divide four type : ( 1 ) evaluation language , ( 2 ) evaluation speed mental processing , ( 3 ) evaluation ability learn use list word , ( 4 ) evaluation visual perception require patient copy complex figure . Before battery administer assess patient 's level pain sit stand use 10 point Visual Analog Scale gauge mood series call Wong/Baker Faces Rating scale . Patients spine surgery may significant pain surgery might impair performance . We also measure Quality Life ( QOL ) enrol patient . This do use two well-known examination ( Telephone Interview Cognitive Status ( TICS ) Centers Disease Control Prevention Health-Related Quality-of-Life 14Item Measure ( CDC HRQOL14 ) ) series question investigate well patient able perform activity daily live ( ADLs ) instrumental activity daily live ( IADLs ) . These test give two time point , surgery one month surgery . We look change quality life may correlate neuropsychometric test performance . Second , peripheral serum sample draw induction , crossclamping carotid artery , 15 minute crossclamping carotid artery 24 hour surgery . Since purpose study determine change `` conventional '' management improve patient 's ability perform battery neuropsychometric test , randomly assign patient either receive `` shunt '' prophylactically surgeon determines technically safe , even conventional management indicate necessary , `` shunt '' indicate EEG , `` conventional '' management . Subjects prophylactic group receive shunt even standard criterion would need receive one . Randomization perform block four patient use randomization table . Using `` block '' randomization increase probability equal number patient `` shunt '' shunt . The surgeon tell group patient randomize induction prior clamp carotid artery .</detailed_description>
