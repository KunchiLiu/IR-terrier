	<brief_summary>The primary objective trial determine whether Talent Thoracic Stent Graft , investigational device , safe effective method treat thoracic aortic aneurysm ( abnormal ballooning vessel wall ) thoracic lesion ( dissection , transections , pseudoaneurysms , penetrate ulcer , etc. ) . The endovascular method substitute major operation perform treat lesion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physician-Sponsored IDE Talent Endoluminal Stent Graft System Treatment Thoracic Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The endovascular method consist insertion catheter ( vinyl tube ) groin artery . These catheter allow position artificial tube stent graft ( ) diseased blood vessel without need major surgery involve open chest . The blood vessel problem ( thoracic aortic aneurysm/lesion ) treat use artificial bypass tube ( stent graft ) place inside diseased artery . The stent graft ( ) use make polyester graft fabric sew self-expanding nickel-titanium ( Nitinol ) wire frame manufacture Medtronic AVE , Santa Rosa California . Aneurysms/lesions locate position along length aorta . This study evaluate aneurysms/lesions occur descend part thoracic aorta traverse chest enters abdominal cavity . The risk thoracic aneurysms/lesions rupture without warn . The risk rupture increase aneurysm size increase . Following rupture , almost patient expire within first 24 hour . For reason treatment thoracic aneurysms/lesions recommend conventional surgical mean patient candidate operation . The conventional operation involve occlude aorta replace aneurysm cloth tube sew replace diseased part aorta . The major surgery occlusion aorta part conventional surgery directly relate several complication report literature . In addition , many patient ill conventional surgery due concomitant illness . After procedure , patient follow regular interval ( pre-discharge , 1 month , 6 month , 12 month every year thereafter life ) part evaluation experimental treatment . During time , patient several test perform evaluate function repair . The test include clinical examination , x-rays chest spiral CT scan . The experimental part placement TALENT Stent-Graft System use catheter ( endovascular ) method . The risk experimental catheter bypass procedure may successful . In case , would require standard operation repair problem . Sometimes risks injury vessel . Small piece diseased artery may dislodge may require removal . Bleeding may occur introduction site , rarely , infection may develop . If catheter bypass unsuccessful , add discomfort procedure may last longer . The benefit procedure patient might avoid pain discomfort associate standard operation . Major surgery avoid hospital stay may much shorter . Patients may able return usual daily activity sooner . In addition , patient high risk conventional surgical treatment aneurysm treat use endovascular graft anatomy appropriate</detailed_description>
