	<brief_summary>The purpose study : Phase I Objectives : - Find tolerated dose use Phase II - Collect information body respond combination study drug Phase II Objectives : - To determine overall response participant use combination study drug The expression proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ( Src ) , substance present significant proportion melanoma play role growth , multiplying , divide cancer cell . Melanoma cell appear sensitive agent block action Src concentration achieve patient . We suggest Src inhibitor ( Dasatinib ) may good choice treatment melanoma combination Dacarbazine ( chemotherapy drug cause shrinkage melanoma ) . We wish evaluate Src inhibitor Dasatinib combination chemotherapy drug Dacarbazine . The novel oral Src inhibitor Dasatinib may able increase effectiveness chemotherapy melanoma compare chemotherapy alone . Dacarbazine standard treatment melanoma currently . The effectiveness chemotherapy drug may increase combination Dasatinib . Dacarbazine approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat melanoma ; Dasatinib approve FDA treat leukemia , approve alone combination Dacarbazine treat melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study Dasatinib Dacarbazine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient receive Dacarbazine intravenously ( IV ) , mean give needle vein arm venous port ( patient already one ) . Dasatinib give orally start day 2 17 day straight ( day 2 19 ) start day patient receives first dose Dacarbazine . The therapy repeat every 21 day ( 21 day = 1 cycle ) . Patient may give drug cycle help reduce side effect therapy . If patient experience severe side effect , amount Dacarbazine and/or Dasatinib receive future cycle may decrease . Cycle 1 day 1 : - Dacarbazine Intravenous - Toxicity assessment - evaluation side effect patient may experience - Medical history* - Physical examination* - measure height , weight , blood pressure , pulse , breathe rate , temperature , assessment patient 's energy activity level ( Eastern Cooperative Group [ ECOG ] Performance Status ) - Blood test ( 3 tablespoon ) safety tests*- Complete blood count differential platelet ( CBC ) , Comprehensive metabolic profile ( CMP ) , &amp; Magnesium test * ( certain test may need perform performed screening within 1 week ; study doctor tell patient need test redo ) Cycle 1 day 8 : - Toxicity assessment - ( do first cycle treatment , discontinue later cycle unless deem necessary study doctor ) - CBC - ( 1 tablespoon ) ( do first cycle treatment , discontinue later cycle unless deem necessary study doctor ) - Dasatinib orally Cycle 1 day 15 : - Toxicity assessment - ( do first cycle treatment , discontinue later cycle unless deem necessary study doctor ) - CBC - ( 1 tablespoon ) do first cycle treatment , discontinue later cycle unless deem necessary study doctor ) - Dasatinib orally - Blood sample pharmacokinetic ( PK ) analysis Patient also take Dasatinib orally instruct day : 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 cycle . Day 1 cycle first cycle : - Dacarbazine Intravenous ( IV ) - Dasatinib orally - Medical history - Physical examination : measure height , weight , blood pressure , pulse , breathe rate , temperature , assessment patient 's energy activity level ( ECOG Performance Status ) - Blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) safety test : CMP &amp; CBC - An electrocardiogram ( EKG ) - Computed tomography ( CT ) scan ( do every cycle start cycle 2 ) - Toxicity assessment If patient decides continue participation study take study study doctor sponsor return clinic one visit . During visit follow procedure perform : - Medical history - Perform physical examination : measure height , weight , blood pressure , pulse , breathe rate , temperature , assessment patient 's energy activity level ( Eastern Cooperative Group [ ECOG ] Performance Status ) - Blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) safety test : CBC &amp; CMP - Toxicity assessment Patient need take assigned Dasatinib dose twice daily . It may take without food .</detailed_description>
