	<brief_summary>Traditional transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) technique use help determine stage rectal cancer . All patient Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center rectal cancer ultrasound begin treatment accurately determine depth penetration ( deep rectal wall tumor go ) lymph node involvement tumor . This information help determine best way treat patient 's disease . Three-dimensional TRUS ( 3-D TRUS ) new form ultrasound give u information traditional ultrasound addition able view tumor 3-dimensions . This image store analyzed evaluate tumor size volume well determine unique shape tumor . Chemoradiotherapy surgery consider standard care rectal cancer . Currently , accurate way determine whether tumor respond pre-operative radiation therapy . The purpose study evaluate response rectal cancer pre-operative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy use 3-D TRUS measure volume tumor chemoradiotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating The Response Pre-Operative Chemotherapy and/or Radiation Therapy For Rectal Cancer Using Three-Dimension Transrectal Ultrasound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) widely accept accurate effective technique stag rectal cancer . The decision administer pre-operative chemotherapy/radiation therapy often make base result TRUS . The great limitation TRUS operator-dependence . Three-dimensional TRUS ( 3-D TRUS ) new modality provide information traditional TRUS well ability provide three dimensional view tumor . This provide great detail regard configuration tumor well ability calculate tumor volume . The result 3-D TRUS interpret study thus , operator-dependence reduce . There currently accept technique allow objective accurate assessment rectal tumor 's response pre-operative treatment short post-operative pathologic evaluation . Our objective evaluate ability 3-D TRUS quantify tumor 's response pre-operative radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy correlate finding post-operative pathologic examination specimen . These objective accomplish 2 ultrasound , one treatment one surgery . All patient biopsy-proven ( pathology confirm MSKCC ) rectal cancer eligible study . The size , volume depth penetration lymph node involvement assess ultrasound examination . Our finding compare find post-operative pathologic examination . These data analyze determine 3-D TRUS accurate predict tumor 's response preoperative treatment .</detailed_description>
