	<detailed_description>radiolabeled anti-MUC1 humanize antibody ) administer intravenously single dose patient locally advance and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer . The primary objective determine dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) 90Y-hPAM4 population . Secondary objective include assessment tumor targeting , biodistribution , organ dosimetry pharmacokinetics ( PK ) 90Y-hPAM4 determined pre-therapy administration 111In-hPAM4 , assessment antigenicity 90Y-hPAM4 , determine development human anti-humanized antibody ( HAHA ) , obtain preliminary information efficacy single dose 90Y-hPAM4 patient population .</detailed_description>

Women pregnant lactating . Women childbearing potential fertile men unwilling use effective contraception study conclusion 12week posttreatment evaluation period . Known metastatic disease central nervous system . Presence bulky disease ( define single mass &gt; 10 cm great dimension ) Patients &gt; Grade 2 anorexia , nausea vomiting , and/or sign intestinal obstruction . Prior treatment nitrosureas , actinomycinD , radioimmunotherapy antibodybased therapy ( murine , chimeric , humanize human ) Prior radiation dose &gt; 3,000 cGy liver , &gt; 2,000 cGy lung kidneys prior external beam irradiation field include 30 % red marrow . Patients nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix exclude , patient prior malignancy must least 5 year disease free interval . Patients know HIV positive , hepatitis B positive , hepatitis C positive . Known history active coronary artery disease , unstable angina , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure present within 6 month cardiac arrhythmia require antiarrhythmia therapy . Known history active COPD , moderatetosevere respiratory illness present within 6 month . Known autoimmune disease presence autoimmune phenomenon ( except rheumatoid arthritis require low dose maintenance corticosteroid ) . Infection require intravenous antibiotic use within 1 week . Other concurrent medical psychiatric condition , Investigator 's opinion , may likely confound study interpretation</criteria>
