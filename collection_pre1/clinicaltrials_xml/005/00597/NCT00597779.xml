	<brief_title>Randomized Comparison 2 Fixation Techniques Unstable Intertrochanteric Hip Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intertrochanteric hip fracture common injury elderly population . They often signify generalized physical deterioration . Operative management become standard care prevent life threaten complication date back 1940 's . The design implant evolve significantly since . The slide hip screw replace static fixation femoral head 1950 's . As result improvement design , failure reduce 9-16 % . The slide hip screw allow stable collapse femoral neck . This lead significant shorten proximal femur comminute fracture . Current treatment modality focus obtain satisfactory union fracture , often expense anatomical alignment . Severely comminuted fracture treat standard plate-hip-screw device thus commonly result significant degree mal-union shortening . In past , implant design restore maintain anatomy hip result high failure rate implant break femoral head . In mid 1980 's , recognition lead development various intramedullary device fixation fracture . The weight-bearing portion implant therefore shift medially , result reduce lever force implant femur . Additionally , IM device rely fixation lateral cortex femur screw . From biomechanical standpoint , intramedullary device distinct advantage , load- sharing device closely locate axis weight bear plate-hip-screw device . Advances intramedullary design promising , clinical result variable . The relatively high rate fracture tip , specifically level lock bolt , hamper widespread popularity intramedullary device . Additionally , large diameter proximal aspect implant require extensive reaming great trochanter partial detachment gluteus medius . This may lead abductor weakness Trendelenburg gait . Some study find increase re-operation rate early hip-nail device compare plate -hip-screw implant . Other study show decreased blood loss operative time nail . A meta-analysis literature favor slide hip screw design . Unfortunately , study focus radiological failure rate rather patient function relate first generation IM device . The new generation nail ( like IM study ) attempt correct shortcoming earlier design . The proximal aspect nail diameter minimize . The distal locking screw locate far away distal end nail lock bolt place oblique fashion . Design alterations femoral head fixation portion nail use helical blade rather screw may improve fixation femoral head . These new design seem compare favorably recent clinical test . Early mobilization patient intramedullary device ( IM ) seem well . Results pilot study indicate early return full mobility shorter operate time IM group . This study include intertrochanteric fracture type demonstrate clear benefit IM many parameter . The currently propose multi-centre study focus unstable A2 intertrochanteric fracture pattern . Considering significantly increase cost new intramedullary device compare standard plate-hip-screw , significant overall improvement patient function realize general use new device could recommend .</detailed_description>
