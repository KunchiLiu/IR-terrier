	<brief_summary>Vaccines contain substance help u make antibody . Different antibody help protect u variety harmful thing . GD2 GD3 gangliosides substance find surface melanoma cell . They also occasionally find normal cell . Large quantity antibody call monoclonal antibody prepare laboratory GD2 GD3 give patient metastatic melanoma . In 10 % case result clinically relevant regression melanoma . These monoclonal antibody currently available use clinic study laboratory indicate vaccine GD2 GD3 effective monoclonal antibody . In trial wish raise level antibody blood GD2 GD3 . We vaccinate modify form GD2 call GD2 lactone GD3 call GD3 lactone ( GD3L ) , attach antibody booster KLH , mixed immune booster ( immunologic adjuvant ) QS-DG . While thousand patient receive vaccine QS-21 , QS-DG use synthesize first time MSKCC refer QS-DG rather QS-21 purify tree bark . QS-21 QS-DG , best knowledge chemically identical . It unknown use bivalent vaccine raise level antibody blood either ganglioside . It unknown raise level antibody blood low risk relapse . This study check blood production antibody , check side effect .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients ≥18 AJCC stage III IV melanoma two week one year become clinically free disease eligible . For patient ' pathology slide must review Memorial Hospital Department Pathology confirm diagnosis cutaneous melanoma . All patient must Karnofsky performance status ≥80 . Patients may receive previous radiation , chemotherapy systemic immunotherapy ( complete least 4 week prior vaccination ) . A CBC must perform within 2 week prior vaccination WBC &gt; equal 3.0 cells/mm3 , Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3 , A screen profile must perform within 2 week prior vaccination total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 , LFTs within normal limit patient 's age . Chest , abdomen pelvic CT MRI must perform within 4 week initiation treatment show evidence disease . Women child bear potential sexually active male must counsel use accept effective method contraception ( include abstinence ) treatment . Patients previously treat KLH ganglioside contain vaccine , monoclonal antibody gangliosides eligible . Women must pregnant ( negative βHCG within 2 week vaccination childbearing potential ) . Patients active cancer within past 2 year , ( exclude basal cell , squamous carcinoma skin cervical carcinomainsitu ) eligible . Any medical condition might make difficult patient complete full course treatment respond immunologically grounds exclusion , discretion Principal Investigator . Patients require antiinflammatory medication steroid , NSAIDS full dose aspirin eligible . There must evidence metastatic disease time first vaccine . However , patient develop new metastasis treatment may continue treatment long systemic treatment indicate local treatment surgical resection radiation would cause delay vaccination two week .</criteria>
