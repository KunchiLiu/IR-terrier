	<brief_summary>The purpose study see brain re-learns control larynx speak swallow undergoing surgical rehabilitation form either thyroplasty vocal fold augmentation unilateral vocal cord paralysis . What need information brain re-learns control speak swallow eventually learn help patient re-learn fast procedure . Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) allow u image brain speak swallow . We produce `` brain map '' speaking , swallow hand movement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Functional Outcomes Patients With Unilateral Vocal Cord Paralysis : Assessment Adaptation Using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose investigation determine cortical mechanism adaptation surgical rehabilitation patient unilateral vocal cord paralysis ( UVCP ) undergo either type I thyroplasty unilateral vocal fold augmentation management unilateral vocal cord paralysis . This study use non-invasive imaging technique , Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) , investigate cortical response response larynx patient UVCP deem candidate either type I thyroplasty unilateral vocal fold augmentation purpose rehabilitate UVCP . Patterns brain activity fMRI study compare preoperative study patient serve control purpose evaluate alteration sensory motor organization brain response UVCP . In addition , responses patient UVCP compare normal control . This allow u identify impact speech swallow subsequent reorganization theorize occur response vocal cord medialization . Patients undergo standardized voice evaluation improvement voice serve secondary endpoint . The result current investigation provide need information central peripheral mechanism adaptation .</detailed_description>
