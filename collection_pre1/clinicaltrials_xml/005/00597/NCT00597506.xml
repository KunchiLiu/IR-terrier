	<brief_summary>The purpose study find safe effective dose drug bevacizumab everolimus give combination treatment metastatic colorectal cancer . Bevacizumab ( also call Avastinâ„¢ ) drug give intravenously ( vein ) . Everolimus ( also call RAD001 ) tablet take mouth . Bevacizumab protein think prevent formation blood vessel tumor need grow . RAD001 multiple capability , like bevacizumab may prevent formation blood vessel need tumor also may stop tumor growth . This study try find safe dose drug tolerate take combination . The study look drug work body , see effect metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm adenocarcinoma colon rectum progress , patient could tolerate , fluoropyrimidine , oxaliplatin , irinotecan , cetuximab and/or panitumumab chemotherapy . Disease must measurable evaluable Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion Patients must radiation therapy , hormonal therapy , biologic therapy chemotherapy cancer within 28 day prior study day 1 . Patients must major surgery within 28 day prior study day 1 minor surgical procedure within 7 day prior study day 1 . Age &gt; 18 year . Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 percent Life expectancy least 3 month . Patients must normal organ marrow function define protocol The effect investigational drug develop human fetus know , drug likely embryo feto toxic . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician study PI immediately . Oral , implantable , injectable contraceptive may affect cytochrome P450 interaction , therefore consider effective study . Patients pregnant and/or lactating exclude study . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients radiation therapy , hormonal therapy , biologic therapy , chemotherapy cancer within 28 day prior day 1 study . Patients receive investigational agent within 28 day prior day 1 study . Patients known central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases . Inadequately control hypertension ( define systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg ) . Initiation antihypertensive permit provided adequate control document least 1 week start treatment . Significant vascular disease ( e.g. , aortic aneurysm , aortic dissection ) Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease Evidence bleed diathesis coagulopathy . Patients therapeutic anticoagulation may enrol provide clinically stable anticoagulation least 2 week . Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior study enrollment ( 56 day hepatectomy , open thoracotomy , major neurosurgery ) anticipation need major surgical procedure course study Core biopsy minor surgical procedure exclude studyrelated procedure placement vascular access device , within 7 day prior expect start treatment . History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 6 month prior study enrollment Serious , nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture Proteinuria screening demonstrate either Urine protein : creatinine ( UPC ) ratio great equal 1.0 screen Any prior history hypertensive crisis hypertensive encephalopathy New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Grade II great congestive heart failure ( see Appendix G ) History myocardial infarction , unstable angina , cardiac vascular stenting , angioplasty , surgery within 6 month prior study enrollment History stroke transient ischemic attack within 6 month prior study enrollment History intolerance hypersensitivity prior treatment bevacizumab RAD001 . Chronic treatment systemic steroid another immunosuppressive agent , though steroid may use asneeded basis ie treatment nausea . Treatment megace low dose glucocorticoid permit treatment anorexia . Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease could compromise safety treatment judge treat physician A known history HIV seropositivity , hepatitis C virus , acute chronic active hepatitis B infection , serious chronic infection require ongoing treatment . Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter drug absorption ( e.g. , inflammatory bowel disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome significant small bowel resection ) Patients active , bleed diathesis oral antivitamin K medication ( except coumadin ) . No history active GI bleeding major bleed within previous 6 month . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol Medical need continuous administration drug affect Cytochrome P450 , family 3 , subfamily A ( CYP3A ) , though use low dose glucocorticoid anorexia /or nausea permit . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit safety compliance study requirement may interfere interpretation result . History interstitial lung disease e.g . pneumonitis pulmonary fibrosis evidence interstitial lung disease baseline chest CT scan .</criteria>
