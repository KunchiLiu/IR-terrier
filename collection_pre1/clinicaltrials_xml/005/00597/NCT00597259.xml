	<brief_title>Pegasys Plus Entecavir Versus Entecavir Alone Hepatitis Be Antigen-Positive Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , several antiviral treatment effective suppression viral replication still fail cure HBV infection patient chronic hepatitis B . The short-term treatment goal thus control hepatitis activity , obtain hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) seroconversion , improve necroinflammatory activity fibrosis liver . Six drug worldwide approve treatment chronic hepatitis B present : conventional IFN ( IFN ) alfa , lamivudine ( LAM ) , adefovir dipivoxil ( ADV ) , pegylated IFN ( Peg-IFN ) alfa , entecavir ( ETV ) recently telbivudine ( LdT ) . Conventional IFN alfa monotherapy narrow range efficacy , associate several adverse effect inconvenient frequent injection . Lamivudine well tolerate ; virologic response lamivudine frequently durable prolonged lamivudine treatment commonly associate emergence drug-resistant HBV mutant . Adefovir dipivoxil effective approve treatment chronic hepatitis B many country , nephrotoxic dose high 10 mg per day long time . Pegylated IFN alfa show superior conventional IFN alfa lamivudine , already approve treatment chronic hepatitis B . Overall , satisfactory virologic serologic response could achieve use pegylated IFN alfa alone around 30-44 % patient . Entecavir , carbocyclic deoxyguanosine analog , active lamivudine- adefovir dipivoxil-naïve -resistant HBV , potent anti-HBV agent ever discover . In addition , 4-year drug resistance rate &lt; 1.0 % select lamivudine-naïve patient . LdT another thymidine nucleoside analogue potent vitro activity HBV approve CHB . Recent phase III GLOBE trial prove agent effective treatment HBeAg+ve -ve chronic hepatitis B lamivudine . However , resistance telbivudine note around 10 % subject 104-week continuous therapy , although still few patient receive lamivudine . Although best treatment choice chronic hepatitis B clarify yet , certain therapeutic concept could derive experience treat patient chronic hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . A major advancement treat hepatitis C HIV infection development combination therapy . Whether combination therapy use Peg-IFN alfa-2a plus ETV achieve long-term beneficial effect ETV alone clarify . A prior single-arm pilot study suggest similar combination therapy may beneficial patient chronic hepatitis B . In proposal , thus hypothesize efficacy use combination therapy pegylated IFN alfa-2a plus ETV superior use ETV alone Peg-IFN may restore host immunity HBV prolong ETV maximize viral suppression . The objective clinical trial evaluate efficacy combination Peg-IFN alfa-2a dose 180 mcg administer subcutaneously per week ETV 0.5 mg daily 24 week follow ETV 0.5 mg daily monotherapy additional 120 week versus ETV 0.5 mg daily monotherapy 144 week patient HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B . It open-label , randomize , comparative , multi-center clinical trial . The recruited patient equally randomize two treatment group . Treatment-free follow-up period 48 week group patient . All subject assess loss HBeAg , presence anti-HBe , loss HBsAg , presence anti-HBs , suppression HBV DNA , normalization serum ALT end treatment end follow-up . Genotypic virologic resistance ETV also assess baseline end year 1 , 2 3 . We anticipate rate HBeAg seroconversion , primary efficacy parameter , around 35 % end 3-year entecavir therapy , decrease 30 % end 24-week post-treatment follow-up . We also anticipate combine Pegasys , rate seroconversion end treatment 50 % end 24-week post-treatment follow-up could 45 % . With 5 % nominal significance level ( one-sided ) , 128 patient per group 1:1 ratio ( total 256 patient ) provide 80 % power detect difference 15 % treatment response rate group I II . Because 4-year study patient , thus anticipate dropout rate may high 15 % . Accordingly , total 294 patient recruit , order account dropout rate 15 % . A final analysis conduct patient complete 144-week treatment 48 week follow-up . Primary secondary efficacy parameter evaluate intention-to-treat analysis . Exact ( 1-sided ) 95 % -confidence interval binomial distribution provide response rate individual patient group . All categorical continuous variable analyze chi-square test Student test , respectively . For continuous variable outlier , nonparametric test use instead . The analysis histologic response include receive pre- post-treatment biopsy .</detailed_description>
