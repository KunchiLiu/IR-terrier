	<brief_summary>This double-blinded study subacromial corticosteroid injection ( steroid injection shoulder ) treat shoulder pain paralyzed ( hemiplegic ) shoulder chronic stroke survivor . This study design evaluate pain relief standard steroid injection treatment , compare high dose treatment low dose treatment , shoulder pain stroke survivor . A total 105 chronic stroke survivor moderate severe shoulder pain enrol . All eligible participant undergo initial test injection localize pain subacromial space . If turns positive , subject randomly assign one three group : 1. low dose group receive 20mg steroid ( triamcinolone ) injection subacromial space affect shoulder ; 2. standard dose group receive standard 40mg steroid ( triamcinolone ) injection subacromial space affect shoulder ; 3. high dose group receive 60mg steroid ( triamcinolone ) injection subacromial space affect shoulder . Study participant rate pain weekly interview . Laboratory-based measure also administer every 4 week . Subjects follow total 13 week . The study thus characterize dose response triamcinolone treatment hemiplegic shoulder pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- A total 105 chronic stroke survivor moderate severe shoulder pain enrol . Subjects enrol study 13 week . Subjects complete protocol visit MetroHealth five time . - Visit 1 : Baseline information demographic , past medical history , inclusion/exclusion issue collect study participant . Pertinent lab work perform determine initial eligibility . - Visit 2 : All initially eligible participant also undergo test injection lidocaine localize pain subacromial bursa ( Neer 's Test ) . A positive Neer 's test require finalize eligibility participation . Participants satisfy inclusion/exclusion criterion ( include positive Neer 's test ) randomize high dose steroid , standard dose steroid , low dose steroid via computer generate random number table . The study participant observer blind grouping . - After initial Neer 's test randomization , participant receive assign injection day . Participants follow additional 12 week , include three follow-up visit ( Visits 3-5 ) . The total participation time study 13 week . - The primary outcome measure BPI 12 . The BPI pain questionnaire , assess `` bad pain '' previous 7 day . Secondary outcome measure BPI 13-15 ( `` least pain '' , `` average pain '' , `` pain right '' ) also assess together BPI 12 . There 4 additional secondary outcome measure , BPI 23 ( assess degree shoulder pain interferes daily activity ) , Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment ( measure poststroke motor impairment ) , pain free external rotation range motion ( ROM ) pain free abduction ROM . - A blinded therapist administer outcome measure . The primary outcome assess weekly basis via telephone ( person week MetroHealth visit ) start day Visit 1 continue 12-weeks steroid injection ( i.e. , 13 week subject 's participation ) . Secondary measure BPI 13-15 also administer weekly along BPI 12 . The remain secondary outcome assess clinic visit least every 4 week start Visit 2 ( Visits 2-5 ) .</detailed_description>
