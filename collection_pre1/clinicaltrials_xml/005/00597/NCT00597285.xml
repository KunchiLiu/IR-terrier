	<brief_summary>This study look evidence virus call HHV-6B may relate seizure form brain injury call mesial temporal sclerosis associate seizure . The study use new , sensitive brain scan try detect brain region might affect virus examine cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF , fluid bathe brain spinal cord ) evidence virus well . Healthy volunteer people seizure uncontrolled anti-epileptic drug 18 45 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen physical examination laboratory test . Participants undergo follow procedure : - PET scan . This test use radioactive chemical call 18FDG , detect PET scanner obtain image brain . The subject lie table head position scanner . A swimming cap small light reflector place head monitor position head scan . A catheter ( plastic tube ) insert artery wrist elbow crease arm obtain blood sample scan , second catheter place vein arm injecting 18FDG . The scan take 2 hour . A second scan may do additional 15 minute . - MRI . This test use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image brain . The subject lie table slide metal cylinder surround magnetic field . Most scan last 45 90 minute . - Lumbar puncture . The subject sits upright lie table knee curl chest procedure . A local anesthetic inject numb skin needle inserted space bone low back CSF circulate spinal cord . A small amount fluid collect needle . - Blood test . About 4 tablespoon blood draw viral test .</brief_summary>
