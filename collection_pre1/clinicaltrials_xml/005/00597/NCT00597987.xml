	<brief_summary>The purpose study collect blood sample patient may use research purpose . These blood sample use researcher institution study cause breast ovarian cancer , good understand cancer develop . We try discover difference way cell work woman high genetic risk develop breast ovarian cancer . Early data suggest gene may turn different way base upon whether woman high genetic risk develop breast ovarian cancer . The primary objective test hypothesis BRCA1 haploinsufficiency regulate gene expression X chromosome . This hypothesis test compare gene expression profile BRCA1 heterozygote ( case ) age-matched group unaffected woman BRCA1 mutation carrier ( control ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BRCA1 Haploinsufficiency Gene Expression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim project test hypothesis BRCA1 haploinsufficiency regulate gene expression X chromosome . This hypothesis examine determine X chromosome gene expression profile , derive lymphocyte RNA , BRCA1 mutation carrier ( case ) distinguish age-matched group woman BRCA1 mutation ( control ) . Neither case control history cancer . This investigation provide valuable insight biologic function BRCA1 role breast and/or ovarian tumorigenesis . Blood sample case collect patient previously undergone genetic counseling Clinical Genetics Service MSKCC test positive germline mutation BRCA1 . Blood sample control obtain two source . First specimen already collect IRB Protocol # 99-030 , entitle `` Collection Tissue , Blood , Cells Used Studying Causes , Prevention , Diagnosis , Treatment Breast Cancer ( T. King , PI ) . Controls also collect patient previously undergone genetic counseling Clinical Genetics Service MSKCC test negative germline mutation BRCA1 . Isolation total RNA blood perform use PAXgeneâ„¢ Blood RNA System . This study use lymphocyte RNA sample 50 individual BRCA1 mutation 50 age-matched control . Gene expression profile perform Genomics Core Laboratory MSKCC supervision Agnes Viale , PhD . Class comparison analysis perform gene expression data Biostatistics Department supervision Adam Olshen , PhD . It anticipate study complete approximately 1 year .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>For acquisition control specimens , sample already collect IRB approve protocol 99030 use . This protocol tissue blood acquisition protocol entitle `` Collection Tissue , Blood , Cells Be Used Studying Causes , Prevention , Diagnosis , Treatment Breast Cancer '' . Patients already give consent sign research authorization use blood specimen purpose . Controls also collect patient previously undergone genetic counseling Clinical Genetics Service MSKCC test negative germline mutation BRCA1 . These individual approach ask donate sample time result appointment . Blood sample case collect patient test positive germline mutation BRCA1 . These woman participant MSKCC protocol 9651 9729 , test outside institution receive followup care MSKCC . Any patient presume pathogenic mutation BRCA1 eligible inclusion . Subjects eligible without regard age , racial , ethnic status . Subjects personal history cancer exclude . Attending physician authorize obtain informed consent may exercise discretion exclude individual appropriate medical ( e.g. , minor , mentally impaired ) reason . Patients unclassified variant BRCA1 exclude functional significance variation unknown .</criteria>
