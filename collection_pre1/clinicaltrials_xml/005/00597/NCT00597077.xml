	<brief_summary>Heart failure clinical syndrome heart unable pump enough blood satisfy organism 's metabolic need . Heart failure become major clinical public health problem approximately 300,000 Canadians affect . Atrial fibrillation rhythm disorder upper chamber heart ( atrium ) paralyze continuous electrical activity . Some continuous chaotic electrical activity atrium travel low cavity heart ( ventricle ) cause beat irregularly rapidly . It frequent cardiac arrhythmia , affect 5 % individual 65 year older associate increase risk stroke . Both condition ( heart failure atrial fibrillation ) often co-exist patient . Heart failure promote atrial fibrillation atrial fibrillation aggravates heart failure . The Atrial Fibrillation Congestive Heart Failure ( AF-CHF ) trial investigate whether preservation normal cardiac rhythm influence mortality morbidity . The AF-CHF study begin 2001 1,378 patient enrol 123 participate centre , North America , South America , Europe , Israel . The result trial expect October 2007 , improve decision-making physician provide useful information healthcare organization responsible care heart failure patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) atrial fibrillation ( AF ) two important grow problem medicine cardiology . Both condition often co-exist complicate 's management . Two therapeutic strategy available patient AF CHF : first aim restore maintain sinus rhythm , whereas , second focus exclusively optimize ventricular rate . The primary objective Atrial Fibrillation Congestive Heart Failure ( AF-CHF ) trial compare two widely-used treatment strategy respect cardiovascular mortality . Hypothesis : Restoring maintain sinus rhythm reduces cardiovascular mortality compare rate control treatment strategy patient AF CHF . Rationale : Despite new therapeutic intervention , prognosis heart failure patient remain grim 5-year survival rate usually less 50 % . In recent , large CHF trial , AF report independently associate increased mortality . Non-randomized observation also suggest patient AF set CHF great tendency revert sinus rhythm amiodarone therapy new class III antiarrhythmic agent maintain normal rhythm well prognosis . There need determine whether treatment strategy attempt maintain sinus rhythm beneficial impact cardiovascular mortality CHF patient . This hypothesis never test prospective , control , adequately-powered randomized trial . Research Plan : AF-CHF prospective , multicentre clinical trial ( 100 centre Canada , USA , Europe ) , randomize 1,450 NYHA class II-IV CHF patient leave ventricular ejection fraction &gt; /=35 % ( NYHA class I patient prior hospitalization CHF ejection fraction &lt; /=25 % also eligible ) history significant AF ( ECG documentation either one episode last &gt; /=6 hour within past 6 month , episode last &gt; /=10 minute within past 6 month patient prior electrical cardioversion AF ) one two treatment strategy : 1 ) rhythm control use electrical cardioversion need combined antiarrhythmic drug therapy ( amiodarone class III agent ) , additional non-pharmacologic therapy resistant patient , 2 ) rate control use drug ( mainly beta-blockers plus digoxin ) and/or pacemaker AV nodal catheter ablation necessary . The enrollment period complete within 2 year minimum follow-up 2 year . Both group receive optimal CHF management ACE inhibitors beta-blockers . Cardiovascular mortality primary endpoint trial . The intention-to-treat approach primary method analysis . Secondary outcome total mortality , hospitalization , stroke , cost therapy quality life . From recent trial data , anticipate 18.75 % 2-year cardiovascular mortality rate control arm 25 % reduction cardiovascular mortality rhythm control group . Assuming 2 % loss follow-up , two-sided alpha level 0.05 annual accrual rate 750 patient , calculate 722 patient per group ( round total number 1,450 patient ) necessary achieve power 0.80 perform log-rank test .

	<criteria>1 . Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; /=35 % measure nuclear imaging , echocardiography , cardiac angiography within 6 month precede enrollment . If patient myocardial infarction heart surgery period , ejection fraction must remeasured . 2 . Symptomatic CHF ( NYHA class IIIV ) time 6 month randomization , despite therapy ACE inhibitor ( however , patient tolerate ACE inhibitor eligible ) . Asymptomatic patient ( NYHA class I ) either prior hospitalization CHF 6 month randomization leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; /=25 % also eligible . 3 . History significant AF , define either : 1. one episode last &gt; /=6 hour ( duration AF determine history ) , within past 6 month electrocardiographic confirmation ; 2. episode last &gt; /=10 minute ( history ) within past 6 month electrocardiographic confirmation patient prior electrical cardioversion AF . 4 . In opinion clinical investigator , patient must eligible longterm treatment either treatment strategy AF . 1 . AF known present uninterrupted 12 month prior randomization . However , patient cardioverted maintained sinus rhythm &gt; /=24 hour , become eligible . 2 . Reversible cause AF acute pericarditis , pulmonary embolism , hyperthyroidism , alcohol intoxication . 3 . AF occur persist beyond 10 day surgery myocardial infarction . 4 . Reversible cause CHF severe aortic mitral stenosis tachycardiainduced cardiomyopathy . 5 . Decompensated CHF within 48 hour randomization . 6 . Antiarrhythmic drug calcium channel blocker , betablockers digoxin require arrhythmias indication . 7 . More 7 day amiodarone therapy within last month prior randomization . 8 . Second third degree AV block , sinus pause &gt; 3 second , rest heart rate &lt; 50 bpm without permanent pacemaker . 9 . History druginduced Torsades de Pointes congenital long QT syndrome . 10 . Prior AV nodal ablation Maze surgery . 11 . Probable cardiac transplantation next 6 month . 12 . Chronic renal failure require dialysis . 13 . Women childbearing potential reliable method birth control . 14 . Geographic social factor , drug alcohol abuse make followup compliance difficult . 15 . Other noncardiovascular medical condition ( cancer ) make 1 year survival unlikely . 16 . Less 18 year age .</criteria>
