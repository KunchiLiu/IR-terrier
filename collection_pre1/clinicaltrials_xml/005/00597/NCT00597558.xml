	<detailed_description>Egg allergy child 5 year age extremely common . Egg , along milk peanut , cause 80 % food allergy reaction child United States . Children allergic reaction egg range mild urticaria systemic anaphylaxis . The current therapy child egg allergy place child egg-free diet allergy outgrown . Because egg protein part significant number process food difficult totally avoid egg protein . Accidental ingestion lead reaction egg occur bite cookie ( ~70 mg egg protein ) bite cake ( ~55 mg egg protein ) . Children typically outgrow egg allergy several year . Therefore would helpful specific form therapy would make child outgrow allergic reaction egg sooner . Egg protein give child study small increase amount desensitize egg protein goal help outgrow allergy .</detailed_description>
