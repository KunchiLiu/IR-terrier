	<brief_summary>People experience wide range outcome follow traumatic event . Although rate differ depend type trauma , 20-60 % trauma victim may develop posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . However , trauma victim develop PTSD . Previous research find trauma victim develop PTSD excrete low level urinary cortisol immediately trauma victim develop PTSD . Other research suggest increase level cortisol may protect development PTSD patient yourself- yet examine . Cortisol naturally occur hormone body , present study design test whether increase cortisol level protect decrease symptom PTSD . Participants study randomly assign one two treatment group . Participants receive either hydrocortisone ( 20mg , twice per day ) placebo ( sugar pill ) 10 day six-day taper . There equal chance either treatment group , neither participant experimenter know treatment receive ( except case emergency ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) With Early Hydrocortisone Treatment : Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) fourth common psychiatric disorder estimate affect ten million American child adult point life . Although number pre- , peri- , acute phase post-trauma variable ( e.g. , prior trauma history , subjective life threat , injury ) show increase one 's risk develop PTSD , initial psychological reaction traumatic event imperfect predictor subsequent diagnosis . In addition , early psychological intervention generally proven ineffective , case , detrimental regard subsequent symptomatology . In light , researcher recently begin examine possible pharmacological intervention could administer acute phase respond trauma prevent reduce severity subsequent post-traumatic stress . Biopsychological research frequently ( always ) indicate patient PTSD excrete low level cortisol similarly-exposed trauma victim develop PTSD . Further , recent research show low cortisol level present soon trauma associate increase risk develop PTSD symptom . These result suggest high level cortisol immediately traumatic event may buffer development PTSD symptom . In addition , preliminary finding suggest exogenously elevate patient ' level cortisol immediately follow trauma result decrease incidence PTSD . However , data collect relatively small sample trauma patient confound medical condition ( e.g. , shock , cardiac surgery , paralysis ) . A randomized control trial ( RCT ) necessary determine efficacy early cortisol administration buffer development post-traumatic stress heterogeneous trauma sample . Prior conduct large-scale RCT , necessary pilot test efficacy early cortisol treatment reduce prevent PTSD symptom representative sample heterogeneous trauma victim . The propose research design examine efficacy hydrocortisone ( commercially-available cortisol ) prevent post-traumatic stress small-scale , randomize , double-blind trial . More specifically , incidence PTSD comorbid disorder ( i.e. , mood , anxiety substance abuse/dependence disorder ) , severity symptom , health-related quality life , hormonal correlate distress prospectively examine trauma victim randomly assign receive either course hydrocortisone placebo within 12 hour traumatic event . As psychological physiological reaction trauma may develop number month post-trauma , prospective follow-up allow u examine efficacy cortisol administration reduce early well delay development symptom . The propose research provide pilot data effect size estimate subsequent large-scale trial , pilot result promise . Specific objective propose research include : 1 . Examination effect early ( within 12 hour trauma ) cortisol administration subsequent symptom PTSD trauma victim . Specifically , victim admit Level 1 trauma unit local hospital randomly assign receive double-blind , low-dose cortisol ( 20mg , twice daily : bid ) placebo ten day plus 6-day taper period . Symptoms psychopathology measure 1- 3-months post-trauma . Secondary analysis examine effect cortisol disorder commonly comorbid PTSD ( i.e. , anxiety , mood , substance abuse/dependence disorder ) health-related quality life . 2 . Examination extent early cortisol administration influence relationship preexist trauma-related factor psychophysiological response trauma . In particular , lifetime incidence psychopathology , prior trauma exposure , injury severity associate increase risk PTSD , examine whether relationship weaken patient receive cortisol regimen . Due budgetary constraint R34 mechanism exploratory nature propose research , able recruit enough participant sufficiently examine objective , thus consider secondary aim . However , result use strengthen guide design subsequent R01 proposal .</detailed_description>
