	<brief_summary>The goal trial determine activity erlotinib rationally select population woman ER-negative , PR-negative , HER2/neu-negative , EGFR-positive breast cancer . If erlotinib show activity , could identify form target therapy specific subset breast cancer patient . In addition , may identify subset breast cancer patient tumor overexpress EGFR EGFR target therapy could warrant test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Open-Label Trial Tarceva Women With Metastatic , Hormone- HER2-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , open-label , single institution trial treatment single agent erlotinib . The purpose research determine effect erlotinib breast cancer tumor woman metastatic hormone receptor negative HER2-negative breast cancer . The Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve erlotinib , also know Tarceva , treatment locally advance metastatic non-small cell lung cancer . To qualify trial , subject must histologically confirm , incurable , locally advanced metastatic breast cancer ER-negative , PR-negative , Her2/neu-negative EGFR-positive . Subjects must measurable disease . They must receive less equal 1 chemotherapeutic agent metastatic setting . The target accrual 43 subject . Initially , 18 subject accrue . If least 3 subject progression-free 4 month , accrual continue maximum 43 subject . Subject eligibility evaluate screening period 4 week . During treatment period , subject receive single agent erlotinib , 150mg/day . Subjects receive first dose erlotinib Day 0 , within 7 day registration . Efficacy assess radiographic tumor assessment photographic documentation . Safety assess record adverse event laboratory test result . Subjects document progressive disease discontinue treatment follow survival information every 2 month death , lose follow-up study termination .</detailed_description>
