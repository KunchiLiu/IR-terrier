	<brief_summary>Pelvic organ prolapse common among woman prevalence estimate high 30 % . Pelvic organ prolapse often involve combination support defect involve anterior , posterior and/or apical vaginal segment . While anterior vaginal wall segment likely demonstrate recurrent prolapse reconstructive surgery , reoperations high among require apical suspension procedure without repair vaginal segment ( 12 % -33 % ) . Despite substantial health impact , paucity high quality evidence support different practice management prolapse , particularly surgery . Thus , objective Operations Pelvic Muscle Training Management Apical Support Loss ( OPTIMAL ) Trial : 1. compare sacrospinous ligament fixation ( SSLF ) uterosacral vaginal vault ligament suspension ( ULS ) ; 2. assess role perioperative behavioral therapy/pelvic muscle training ( PMT ) woman undergo vaginal surgery apical uterine prolapse stress urinary incontinence .</brief_summary>
