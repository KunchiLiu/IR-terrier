	<brief_title>Comparing Knee Cartilage Surgery Versus Standard Physical Therapy Treating People With Meniscal Tear Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OA common form arthritis United States . Symptoms knee OA include pain around knee typically worsen weight-bearing activity , morning stiffness , tenderness . A person OA experience torn meniscus -- cartilage structure within knee provide stability proper weight distribution -- especially risk disability . Past study show arthroscopic partial meniscectomy ( APM ) , type knee surgery , usually relieve symptoms improves function people suffer meniscal tear . However , success APM variable among people already exist OA . Clinicians also uncertain short- long-term benefit , drawback , indication APM people OA meniscal tear . The purpose study compare effectiveness two treatment , APM surgery standard physical therapy , people OA torn meniscus . This study last 5 year . At initial study visit , participant randomly assign one two group . - Group 1 participant undergo APM surgery time convenient participant surgeon . After surgery , participant refer rehabilitative physical therapy regain strength flexibility knee . For participant choose physical therapy , duration treatment depend individual progress . - Group 2 participant receive standard physical therapy increase strength flexibility knee . This include one three weekly exercise session 8-week period . The study consist 3 visit center : - Visit 1 , enrollment visit : sign consent form , fill questionnaire , physical examination knee find treatment group ( surgery physical therapy - Visit 2 , 3 month enrollment : Fill questionnaire physical examination knee - Visit 3 , 18 month : Fill questionnaire , MRI knee ( eligible ) xrays knee Telephone call : During first 3 month study , participant receive check-up phone call every 2 week , follow quarterly phone call initial 2 year study Questionnaires : Participants also complete mail questionnaire 6 month , 1 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 3.5 , 4 , 4.5 5 year enrollment .
