	<brief_title>GenTeal Perioperative Treatment Laser Assisted Situ Keratomileusis LASIK Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LASIK ( Laser Keratomileusis Situ ) frequently perform procedure reduce refractive error eye minimize subsequent need eyeglass contact lens . The procedure require creation superficial corneal flap , usually instrument know microkeratome . During creation flap microkeratome , corneal epithelium typically subject slide stress occasionally cause disruption epithelial surface , complication potentially serious adverse effect post operative visual acuity . As well , shortly creation flap , patient often dilate invariably treat topical anesthetic . These agent , preservative , negative effect corneal epithelial integrity , right epithelium must withstand passage microkeratome . Therefore , imperative epithelium best possible condition prior LASIK procedure . For reason , ocular lubricant may use period time prior surgery order maximize epithelial health . In immediate post-operative period bond newly create flap underlie corneal stroma weak , epithelium subject pharmacologic mechanical stress note . It imperative surface continuity epithelium edge flap surround surface restore rapidly possible , reestablishment intact epithelial surface minimize risk flap shift , epithelial ingrowth , infection . For reason , generally accept standard care use aggressive ocular lubrication post-operative period order maximize speed epithelial recovery . GenTeal Lubricant Eye Drops GenTeal Gel , ( 0.3 % hypromellose , Novartis Ophthalmics , Basel , Switzerland ) provide natural alternative preservative-free treatment , sodium perborate preservative system long-lasting action due carbomer gelling agent . The perborate preservative , breaks water oxygen ocular surface , essentially deliver preservative-free lubricant eye . This make GenTeal product attractive agent use LASIK perioperative period .</detailed_description>
