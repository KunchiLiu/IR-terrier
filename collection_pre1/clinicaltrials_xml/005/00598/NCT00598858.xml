	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial study docetaxel prednisone treating patient newly diagnose stage I-II prostate cancer undergo prostatectomy . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Biological therapy , prednisone , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Giving docetaxel prednisone together may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate 3-month prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) decline least 30 % chemotherapy regimen docetaxel prednisone patient stage I/II prostate cancer , schedule prostatectomy . II . To compare tumor , pathological PSA response neoadjuvant docetaxel patient intermediate high grade prostate cancer . III . To obtain prostate specimen genomic correlate response chemotherapy regimen docetaxel prednisone . OUTLINE : Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 2 prednisone orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo prostatectomy within 3 week completion chemotherapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow within 7 day .</detailed_description>
