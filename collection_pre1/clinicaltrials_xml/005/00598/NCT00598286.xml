	<brief_title>PET Imaging Cannabinoid CB1 Receptors Using 18FFMPEP-d2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BRAIN IMAGING Objective The central cannabinoid receptor ( CB1 ) one abundant neuromodulatory receptor brain . It find glutamatergic , dopaminergic GABA-ergic synaptic terminal belong G-protein couple receptor family . The CB1 target drug therapy , include use antagonist appetite suppressant . The central cannabinoid receptor CB1 never visualize human . In collaboration Eli Lilly , develop promise PET ligand CB1 receptor : [ 18F ] FMPEP-d2 ( ( 3R,5R ) -5- ( 3- ( fluoromethoxy ) phenyl ) -3- ( ( R ) -1-phenylethylamino ) -1- ( 4- ( trifluoromethyl ) phenyl ) pyrrolidin-2-one ) . Study Population In current protocol , wish evaluate [ 18F ] FMPEP-d2 approximately 10 healthy subject . Design Brain imaging study consist subject evaluation follow PET MRI scan . Outcome Measures We intend determine kinetics brain uptake washout , clearance plasma , distribution volume [ 18F ] FMPEP-d2 calculate compartmental modeling . Distribution volume proportional density receptor equal ratio equilibrium uptake brain concentration parent radiotracer plasma . WHOLE BODY DOSIMETRY Objective Should brain image study prove successful , continue whole body dosimetry study . Preliminary dosimetry study [ 18F ] d2-FMPEP perform nonhuman primate ; however , need continue human investigation novel tracer continue . Study Population In current protocol , wish evaluate [ 18F ] FMPEP-d2 approximately 10 additional healthy subject . Design The whole body dosimetry study consist subject evaluation follow PET scan . Outcome Measures We intend determine whole body distribution activity thereby calculate radiation exposure organs body . BRAIN IMAGING WITH TEST/RE-TEST Objective Should brain image dosimetry study prove successful , continue test/retest brain imaging study . Test/retest study [ 18F ] FMPEP-d2 provide evidence reproducibility strengthen assurance radioligand use assess pathology . Previous investigation develop CB1 receptor PET tracer demonstrate need test reproducibility ( Terry , In Writing ; Burns et al 2007 ) . Study Population In current protocol , wish evaluate [ 18F ] FMPEP-d2 approximately 10 additional healthy subject . Design The brain image test/retest study consist subject evaluation follow one MRI two PET scan . Outcome Measures We intend determine reproducibility outcome measure brain imaging , namely , distribution volume .</detailed_description>
