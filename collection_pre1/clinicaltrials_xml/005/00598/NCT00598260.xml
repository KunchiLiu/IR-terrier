	<detailed_description>The study include patient prenatal care Paley clinic AEMC , resident provide prenatal care supervision OBGYN attend physician , affiliate clinic staff care giver OBGYN department . Patients obstetric clinic schedule weekly visit start 36 week . At 36 37 week gestation , early , patient offer participate study . Those refuse continue standard care consider part study . Those wish participate study consent randomly assign control group AMOR-IPAT group ratio 2:1 . Risk factor identify patient participate study gestational age 36 37 week ( use digichart system , medical record questioner ) upper limit optimal time delivery calculate patient , accord method use UPenn group , time always least 38 week 41 week . Patients AMOR-IPAT group schedule induction labor morning day calculate upper limit ( plus minus 2 day ) . To try eliminate bias , uniform method induction apply patient participate study , matter group reason induction . The induction perform misoprostol 25mcg intravaginally every four hour ( maximum three dos ) Bishop score 4 less long tachysystole define six uterine contraction ten minute consecutive ten minute interval . The misoprostol follow foley bulb inflate 80 cc fluid cervix still favorable three dos tachysystole develops . Once cervix favorable induction continue high dose oxytocin ( start dose six milliunits increment four milliunits every thirty minute ) , associate less cesarean delivery dystocia low dose . Anesthesia apply accord patient 's wish , without limit epidural anesthesia certain degree dilatation . After delivery information collect chart two group compare regard incidence cesarean delivery , also regard intrapartum variable major outcome . The Student test Wilcoxon rank sum test use compare continuous demographic characteristic , past medical surgical historic feature obstetric risk factor present two study group . Universal chi square test use compare level various dichotomous variable . Statistical significance define probability value less 0.05 . Using power analysis assume cesarean delivery rate 20 % control group change 13 % ( show original study ) need 191 patient control group 96 study group . All data collect staff OBGYN department maintain departmental secure password limited database . Obstetrical prenatal data maintain HIPPA compliant password protect electronic medical record .</detailed_description>
