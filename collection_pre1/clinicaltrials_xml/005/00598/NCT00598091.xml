	<brief_summary>The purpose study find high dose drug gemcitabine dasatinib give treatment pancreatic cancer . Gemcitabine ( also call Gemzar™ ) drug give intravenously . Dasatinib ( also call Sprycel™ ) tablet take mouth . Gemcitabine approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment advance breast , lung pancreatic cancer . Dasatinib approve FDA treatment chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) , acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient resistant imatinib mesylate ( Gleevec™ ) . This study try find high dos drug tolerate take combination . The study also look drug work body , see effect pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/Expansion Study Dasatinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multicenter , non-randomized phase I trial gemcitabine plus twice daily dasatinib design assess safety , tolerability , maximum tolerate dose/recommended phase II dose , preliminary efficacy combination adult patient advance solid tumor previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer . Patients accrue Duke University Medical Center , Duke Oncology Network , University North Carolina Chapel Hill Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center Patients accrue either gemcitabine/dasatinib arm alternate sequential order . In case open slot particular arm alternative , enrol patient assign open slot . For example , start trial , patient # 1 treated gemcitabine dasatinib twice daily dose arm , patient # 2 gemcitabine dasatinib daily dose arm , patient # 3 gemcitabine dasatinib twice daily dose arm , . However , , due cohort expansion slot available one treatment arm , patient accrue open slot . Additionally , one arm held , delay , pursue , accrual alternate arm may continue . Patients treat physician able choose treatment arm patient assign . This enrollment procedure procedure entire trial . For dose escalation portion trial , patient accrue Duke University Medical Center . For expanded cohort portion patient previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer treat recommended phase II dose arm , patient may accrue Duke University Medical Center , sit list . NOTE : The first stage close December 2008 . Subjects enrol second stage study . - Toxicity assess every visit , clinically indicate . - Dose limit toxicity assess cycle 1 . - Efficacy assess every 2 cycle , clinically indicate . - Plasma biomarkers assess baseline every restaging . - Tissue base biomarkers ( tumor granulation tissue ) assess 15 patient treated Duke . Tissue biopsy set ( 4mm `` stimulus '' biopsy 5mm `` granulation '' tissue biopsy , location ) also do pre-treatment on-treatment . Pre-treatment biopsy do day -7 1 , respectively . On-treatment biopsy do day 1 8 , respectively .</detailed_description>
