	<brief_summary>Eighty percent patient tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC ) renal angiomyolipomata . These lesion grow lead significant morbidity hemorrhage renal failure . Understanding natural history lesion understand lesion may prone grow quickly develop aneurysm predispose hemorrhage greatly assist clinical care patient TSC . The objective test hypothesis serial MR CT image allow objective , reproducible quantification angiomyolipoma growth volumetric analysis , analysis lesion characteristic identify angiomyolipomata rapid growth potential would require intervention . The specific aim proposal collect clinically obtain serial abdominal image Tuberous Sclerosis Natural History Consortium Centers analyze volume adiposity individual angiomyolipomata . The growth rate hypothesize inverse relationship adiposity . Yearly renal MR CT image perform patient TSC . The image cod site acquisition , transfer via VPN secure server Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center . Using innovative imaging processing software ( Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Image Processing Software ( CCHIPS ) , image data segment reveal various tissue component base signal intensity . Different signal intensity differentiate normal renal parenchyma , renal angiomyolipomata . Using image data novel software , volume individual angiomyolipoma , well adiposity determine . Imaging enrollment ( year 1 ) serve baseline . At year two three , lesion undergo repeat analysis . Angiomyolipoma growth rate adiposity three year analyze test hypothesis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives . Our objective test hypothesis serial MR CT image allow objective , reproducible quantification angiomyolipoma growth volumetric analysis , analysis lesion characteristic identify angiomyolipomata rapid growth potential would require intervention . The specific aim proposal collect clinically obtain serial abdominal image Tuberous Sclerosis Natural History Consortium Centers analyze volume adiposity individual angiomyolipomata . The growth rate hypothesize inverse relationship adiposity . The prognostic value identify lesion aggressive growth characteristic large , intervention institute early order reduce renal damage . Study Population . 1 . The target population study patient tuberous sclerosis attend tuberous sclerosis clinic part consortium . The data collect include routine imaging data , age , gender , know , genotype . Approximately 855 patient throughout United States ask participate natural history study 450 anticipated consent complete data 3 year CT MR Imaging Scans measure angiomyolipoma growth adiposity . 2 . Patients attend tuberous sclerosis clinic member consortium ask would involve study . 3 . Imaging obtained part standard care Consortium Centers . Imaging do pregnant patient exclude . MRI use extensively pregnant patient . Protocol Design . This natural history study involve image characteristic angiomyolipomata find patient tuberous sclerosis complex . This study offer potential benefit lesion characteristic growth rate monitor . Patel et al . posit growth rate great 0.5 cm/year solid tumor worrisome malignancy . Patients harbor lesion exhibit fast growth rate identify carefully monitor . During course study , detect concern feature , Consortium Center TS Clinic Director alert . Imaging modality may use include CT scan . The patient data collect do clinical reason , every effort make use least possible radiation exposure . There several way reduce exposure , limit technique employ scan . The scan perform pre post contrast use agent OptirayÂ® vascularity assess . Patients may also image 1.5 Tesla magnet supine position use phased array torso coil body coil , depend patient size . When compatible , respiratory compensation use diminish respiratory artifact . Overall imaging time follow sequence approximately 45 minute . . Recruitment process : Patients recruit patient see Tuberous Sclerosis Natural History Consortium Centers , include Cincinnati Children 's Hospital , Loma Linda University , University Pennsylvania Medical Center , Connecticut Children 's Medical Center , Vanderbilt University , Columbus Children 's , Texas Scottish Rite Hospital , Massachusetts General Hospital , Miami Children 's Hospital , Minnesota Epilepsy Group , Dartmouth University , Washington Children 's Hospital , New York University School Medicine , University Texas , Houston , Children 's Hospital , Boston , Children 's Hospital , Pittsburgh .</detailed_description>
