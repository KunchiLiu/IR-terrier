	<brief_summary>The purpose research sub-study determine change heart function bedrest period use ultrasound MRI . This topic important medical care astronaut space . It enable physician grind monitor exercise protocol use prevent deconditioning-loss strength long space flight . Your participation study would include ultrasound examination bicycle exercise , , 12-week bedrest period . MRI exam would perform bedrest period . Each echo exam may last 1 hour . This time require perform ultrasound examination supine ( lie ) bicycle exercise . The exercise period approximately 10-15 minute . The bicycle exercise symptom-limited test . This mean test stop experience discomfort . An ultrasound examination heart do assess heart function . You ask lie left side examination table technician take picture heart small probe gently press chest apply gel . The ultrasound data process evaluate myocardial strain , value may useful describe heart function . Each MRI may last 1 hour . An MRI obtain body picture create use magnetic energy rather x-ray energy . To scan , lie table slide scanner , like large tube . An MRI examination heart do assess heart function . You ask lie still follow simple breathing instruction procedure . The MRI data process evaluate volume blood pump heart , value may useful describe heart function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>NASA NSBRI make considerable investment bedrest study conduct Cleveland Clinic Foundation directorship Peter Cavanaugh , primarily assess impact exercise prevention osteoporosis twelve-week bedrest study simulate microgravity . This provide outstanding opportunity synergistic add-on study combine resource bone team NSBRI Cardiovascular Alterations Smart Medicine conduct series detail echocardiographic computed tomographic examination heart patient . These study serve advance number specific aim grant currently hold James D. Thomas NSBRI concern primary effect microgravity heart reversal exercise well ability prove new echocardiographic method measure cardiac response exercise . Finally , provide excellent opportunity prove methodology develop remote delivery healthcare image fusion free-flight study in-flight echo . We pursue follow specific aim synergistic study : Specific Aim 1 : To assess impact bedrest cardiac atrophy , stiffen leave ventricular diastolic pressure volume curve , exercise tolerance ventricular mechanic demonstrate least partial prevention change propose exercise prescription . Specific Aim 2 : To demonstrate ability novel echocardiographic index ventricular function ( strain , torsion , IVPG ) predict functional capacity response exercise . Specific Aim 3 : To test whether pre-bedrest MRI examination could co-registered bedrest 3D echocardiographic exam track atrophy alter cardiac anatomy . The ability detail 3D ground examination compare precisely in-flight 3D echo key goal autonomous medical care system expedition class mission . Proposed Protocol ( summary ) : Pre-bedrest ( within 1-3 week prior ) : 1 . Resting two three-dimensional echocardiogram . 2 . Maximal supine bicycle test echocardiographic assessment wall motion , tissue strain , tissue torsion , intraventricular pressure gradient ( IVPG ) color M-mode flow propagation . In addition peak exercise assessment , also focus submaximal level ( heart rate ~100 ) . 3 . MRI examination heart LV volume mass subsequent cross registration echocardiogram . Six week bedrest : 1 . Resting two three-dimensional echo exam . 2 . Low-level supine bicycle exercise echo ( HR great 100 ) torsion , strain , IVPG assessment . Twelve week bedrest : 1 . Resting two three-dimensional echo . 2 . Maximal supine bicycle test echocardiographic assessment wall motion , tissue strain , tissue torsion , IVPG . 3 . MRI examination heart . As part overall bedrest protocol ( IRB 6504 ) , patient randomize either complete bedrest negative tilt vs. undergo daily horizontal treadmill exercise replace calcaneus impact measure pre-bedrest subject . This provide excellent opportunity assess impact degree type exercise cardiovascular system . The specific aim synergistic study answer follow : Specific Aim 1 : To assess impact bedrest cardiac atrophy , stiffen leave ventricular diastolic pressure volume curve , exercise tolerance ventricular mechanic demonstrate least partial prevention change propose exercise prescription . LV mass measure MRI pre- post-bedrest 3D echo bedrest stage . Two-way linear regression use determine change time LV mass compare response exercise . Similarly , exercise capacity analyze . Among LV mechanic parameter available analysis 3 data acquisition point : ( rest ) LV end-diastolic end-systolic volume , leave atrial volume , transmitral E A wave E-wave deceleration time , Doppler tissue annular E , A , S wave , radial , circumferential , longitudinal strain midventricular level , LV torsion peak untwist rate , color M-mode IVPG . These parameter also available analysis low-level ( HR 100 ) bicycle exercise . Specific Aim 2 : To demonstrate ability novel echocardiographic index ventricular function rest ( strain , torsion , IVPG ) predict functional capacity response exercise . Strain , torsion , IVPG assess stage correlate change cardiac atrophy parameter ( LV mass volume ) . Specific Aim 3 : To test whether pre/post bedrest MRI examination co-registered bedrest 3D echocardiographic exam track atrophy alter cardiac anatomy . The ability detail 3D ground examination compare precisely in-flight 3D echo key goal autonomous medical care system expedition class mission .</detailed_description>
