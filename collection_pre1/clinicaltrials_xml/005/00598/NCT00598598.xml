	<brief_summary>The National Space Biomedical Research Institute interest learn heart function space . One potential problem long duration , man space flight muscle loss- include loss heart muscle . One goal research help identify muscle loss occur . We interested patient undergo aortic valve surgery procedure perform correct problem valve may also change heart function . This change heart function may provide information useful understanding potentially preventing loss cardiac muscle space . Three patient group study , patient surgery aortic regurgitation , aortic stenosis , coronary bypass . We plan perform study 30 patient , 10 group . The aim study continue ongoing study magnitude predictor change size leave ventricle follow acute volume pressure unload ground-based analog man space flight .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Among serious risk identify NASA area cardiovascular alteration serious dysrhythmias development orthostatic intolerance . Prolonged exposure microgravity may lead reduction cardiac performance , particularly time stress undiagnosed cardiovascular disease may manifest long mission . The PI colleague work closely NASA NSBRI last six year optimize use ultrasound space program investigative modality , address fundamental cardiovascular problem need countermeasure development . We propose follow specific aim : To continue ongoing study magnitude predictor LV mass regression follow acute volume pressure unload ground-based analog man spaceflight . This work continue focus patient undergoing aortic valve surgery , exploit recent knowledge role cytokines integrins involve cardiac hypertrophy regression well emerge technology gene chip analysis . This work closely focused risk critical question identify Cardiovascular Alterations Team describe Bioastronautics Critical Path Road Map Baseline Document . If successful , project enhance assessment cardiac function long duration mission potentially suggest cytokine promoter signal transduction pathway could target cardiac atrophy countermeasure . In addition , continue provide facility Core laboratory access investigator throughout NASA NSBRI program need assistance acquire analyze ultrasonic data .</detailed_description>
