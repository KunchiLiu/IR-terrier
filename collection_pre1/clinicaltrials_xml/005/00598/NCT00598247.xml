	<brief_summary>This study use drug PPX ( also call Xyotax CT-2103 ) woman advance colorectal cancer . PPX experimental drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . PPX show laboratory study human cause cancer cell die tumor shrink . Women study PPX show live long men receive drug . Some study human suggest estrogen ( hormone find woman ) may protect woman get colorectal cancer allow woman get colorectal cancer live long men . The purpose study see woman colorectal cancer certain level estrogen experience tumor shrinkage receive drug PPX . This study also study gene ( gene cell 's blueprint ) participant 's tumor blood .
