	<brief_summary>Doctors MSKCC research study see smoker interested idea gene might marker cancer risk , see smoker would want learn information risk available . Different version gene call UGT1A7 find different people . Certain version gene increase risk cancer people . In study , doctor determine different type UGT1A7 smoker find whether smoker show good interest understanding . The information study use future study identify smoker increase risk cancer , help smoker quit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study consist two arm ; observational study molecular assessment risk tobacco related cancer . Arm A protocol pilot crosssectional study evaluate feasibility obtain test genetic marker cancer susceptibility ( UGT1A7 polymorphisms ) smoker . It also explore smoker ' interest comprehension genetic risk assessment possible tool increase motivation smoking cessation . The second arm protocol , Arm B , observational prospective evaluation putative noninvasive biomarker tobacco smoke exposure - urinary prostaglandin E-metabolite ( PGE-M ) - smoker motivate reduce and/or cease smoking .</detailed_description>
