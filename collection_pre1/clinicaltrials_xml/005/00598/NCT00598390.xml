	<brief_title>PET Imaging Cannabinoid CB1 Receptors Using 11CMePPEP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MePPEP ligand highly selective cannabinoid type 1 ( CB1 ) receptor . This receptor consider common G-coupled protein receptor brain ( Pacher et al. , 2006 ) . The CB1 receptor site action Delta-9-tetrahydrocannbinol ( THC ) , active compound marijuana , find primarily presynaptic terminal dopaminergic , glutamatergic , GABAergic neuron ( Howlett et al. , 2002 ) . The function CB1 receptor entirely clear ; however , implicate several neurological psychiatric disorder , selective inverse agonist , rimonabant , currently use Europe treatment obesity ( Van Gaal et al. , 2005 ) . [ 11C ] MePPEP develop enhance understanding vivo characteristic CB1 receptor ( e.g. , receptor density receptor occupancy pharmaceutical ) . The purpose protocol establish accurate method measure CB1 receptor level brain performing test/retest brain imaging study . The result overall study require apply PET ligand various neurological psychiatric disorder future .</detailed_description>
