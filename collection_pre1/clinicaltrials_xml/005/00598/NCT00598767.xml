	<detailed_description>In Bioastronautics Critical Path Roadmap Baseline Document , NASA outline urgent threat life health man spaceflight currently need countermeasure development . This proposal specifically address one four critical risk directly , risk trauma acute medical problem , ID # 43 Clinical Capabilities discipline area . Critical provision acute chronic medical service space availability high quality diagnostic imaging , either ground-based autonomous interpretation . While development novel sensor technology actively pursue within NSBRI , clear foreseeable future , principal diagnostic imaging modality crew use space ultrasound . For past six year , Cleveland Clinic work NASA NSBRI comprehensive program develop ultrasonographic capability use manned space flight . Recent work focus enhancement capability , include 3D image novel compression registration technique assess change time ultrasonic image . We propose extend capability significant way , capitalize dramatic recent advance telecommunication computerization good address critical countermeasure identify . Among convergent trend ultrasound seek capitalize following : commonly apply diagnostic imaging test ; Miniaturization ; file storage ; telemedicine ; wireless telemetry ; therapeutic use ; real-time 3D . We propose extend work follow Specific Aims : 1 . Extension longstanding research 3D ultrasound recently develop third generation machine small enough fit ISS , allow comprehensive image do less operator expertise . 2 . Utilization ultrafast 3D CT scanner acquire full body 3D image segmentation registration subsequently acquire 3D ultrasound image , model future mission ground-based 3D CT MRI could provide template judge physiologic pathologic change observe space 3D ultrasound .</detailed_description>
