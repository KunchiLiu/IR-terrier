	<brief_summary>As consequence damage multiple organ system throughout course disease , diabetic patient suffer number chronic complication give rise increase morbidity , mortality , health care cost specific population . Within ophthalmic domain , diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) frequently induce serious visual impairment . Although DR address surgically , surgery remain less ideal intervention within population well-characterized compromised ability heal . The introduction therapeutic agent could accelerate wound closure decrease healing time , thereby reduce risk incidence infection corneal scar susceptible patient , would represent significant clinical pharmacoeconomic advance treatment condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In individual certain clinical condition , diabetes , corneal epithelial defect persist necessarily respond conventional treatment regimen delay epithelial wound healing . While wound closure occur follow injury corneal epithelium , timely re-establishment epithelial barrier utmost importance . The wound repair process intricately link complex inflammatory response must properly regulate ensure heal optimal visual outcome . Infiltration inflammatory cell injure corneal tissue hallmark wound repair , association polymorphonuclear ( PMN ) leukocyte infiltration sterile corneal ulceration well recognize . Retardation epithelial recovery persistent inflammation , release enzymatic product degranulating PMN , stimulation mononuclear leukocytes cytokine contribute poor re-epithelialization . It show diabetic cornea manifest reduce rate epithelial healing denudement . Yet , diabetic patient , rate corneal epithelial heal clinical concern , abnormality inherent diabetic corneal epithelial cytoarchitecture cause substantial impediment normal stromal healing . Histologically , diabetic cornea typically demonstrate thicken epithelial basal membrane ( BM ) , decrease number hemidesmosomes , decrease number nerve fiber ending . Studies BM change diabetic cornea yield information regard poor adhesion epithelial BM stroma . During vitrectomy diabetic patient , cornea epithelium remove , separate intact sheet entire thicken BM , characteristic diabetes , adhere epithelium . In contrast , normal epithelium remove scraping , BM remain adherent stroma . Because patient diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) corneas delay wound healing , expression thymosin beta 4 ( Tβ4 ) potent epithelial cell migration stimulator DR corneas investigate . Human DR cornea analyze found express significantly less Tβ4 compare normal cornea , suggest use Tβ4 may accelerate wound-healing process model .</detailed_description>
