	<brief_summary>The purpose study see researcher improve detection lung cancer use new method help u take multiple snapshot image lung patient breathing . We also investigate whether help new method well measure actual amount radioactivity take cancer . The name new method respiratory gate PET/CT . Previous research show PET scan may useful investigate whether cancer spread part lung body . Using standard method , small cancer sometimes difficult detect lung PET image take several minute patient breathing time . That mean cancer may appear `` blur '' image ( like poor photograph ) may identify . In study , addition image order doctor , take additional image lung follow breathing command ( `` breath in-hold-breath '' ) . We compare images cancer regular PET study take breathe command . The hypothesis test pilot study : 1 . Respiratory gated image acquisition reduce partial volume effect PET image may render lung lesion undetectable . 2 . Breath-hold CT may detect small lung lesion beyond limit detection shallow-breathing CT scan , related respiratory motion cause blur artifact around small lung lesion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Breathing Synchronized PET/CT Imaging In Detection Quantification FDG Uptake Lung Nodules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Positron emission tomography clinically accept image modality evaluation pulmonary nodule well stag patient lung cancer . PET image radiotracer 18 Fluoro-deoxy-glucose ( FDG ) high accuracy differentiation benign malignant lung lesion detection nodal metastasis . This malignant tumor characterize increase glucose metabolism compare normal tissue . In clinical practice , PET image interpret visually semiquantitatively , use standardize uptake value ( SUV ) . Previous study show SUV threshold use high accuracy distinguish benign malignant lesion exhibit increased uptake FDG . In addition , SUV frequently use surrogate marker evaluation response chemo- radiation therapy . Unfortunately , accuracy SUV measurement may affect lesion motion image acquisition . This particular problem PET imaging lung . Normal respiratory motion , hence lesion motion , cause smear effect , whereby concentration radiotracer within give lesion spread large area . For reason small lesion lesion relatively low uptake radiotracer may become undetectable normal breathing ( partial volume effect ) . PET image acquire several minute , image acquisition breath hold therefore option clinical scan . However recently publish work UCLA ( Auerbach et al . J Nucl Med. , February 2006 ) show 3 lesion per patient average miss shallow breathing scan compare breath-hold CT scan . These lesion show FDG uptake clinical PET scan . The goal pilot study evaluate whether respiratory gate PET image acquisition enable detection lesion identify breath-hold CT scan .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age â‰¥ 18 year old Patients must least one lung lesion lung cancer prior chest Xray chest CT. Sign inform consent . Eligible patient give consent begin clinical PET scan . Following clinical CT PET scan , breathhold CT follow . Then , breathhold CT image review one investigating physician determine patient qualifies study . If small lesion ( &lt; 5 mm ) gate PET image acquire . Pregnant woman ineligible . Patients unable follow breathing instruction either due language difficulty hear impairment This determine one consenting individual approach patient ask inform consent . Patients ill hold breath .</criteria>
