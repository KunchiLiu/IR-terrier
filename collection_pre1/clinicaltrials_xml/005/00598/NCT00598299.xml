	<brief_summary>Human serum eye drop successfully use treatment severe ocular surface disorder enhancement corneal wound heal . Umbilical cord serum also proven effective treatment dry eye persistent corneal epithelial defect . However , limited study compare corneal epithelial wound heal promote effect two blood derive product . The purpose study test corneal epithelial wound heal promote effect auto serum human cord blood serum . Primary culture bovine corneal epithelial cell use model investigate wound healing , cell proliferation migration mean scratch corneal wound heal assay evaluation , MTS assay Boyden chamber migration assay response human serum umbilical cord serum . The concentration EGF , TGF-β1 , fibronectin also compare human serum umbilical cord serum ELISA kit .</brief_summary>
