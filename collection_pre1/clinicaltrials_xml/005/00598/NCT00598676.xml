	<brief_title>3 Limus Agent Eluting Stents With Different Polymer Coating</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug-eluting stent significantly reduce in-stent restenosis subsequent need target vessel revascularisation compare bare metal stent . Although applies vast majority patient , intimal hyperplasia in-stent restenosis completely eliminate remain occur certain high risk subgroup . Thus ongoing research new , potentially effective safe drug-eluting stent system . One direction extensive research search new polymer biodegradable polymer allow control drug-release disappear time , reduce probability polymer-induced chronic inflammation vessel wall . Another direction find new drug suppress neointimal hyperplasia . Promising preclinical clinical result suggest Everolimus elute stent platform might provide potential improvement prior generation drug-eluting stent .</detailed_description>
