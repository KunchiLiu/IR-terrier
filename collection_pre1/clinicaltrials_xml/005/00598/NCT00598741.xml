	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether fast image MRI usual contrast material use MRI , predict patient well treatment . Some study suggest MRIs do right surgery may able tell much cancer kill chemotherapy . This study see true patient osteogenic sarcoma ( OS ) Ewing 's sarcoma ( ES ) . This study also see MRIs do early treatment tell chemotherapy work .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI ( DCE-MRI ) Bone Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo DCE-MRI study prior chemotherapy , 18-24 day start treatment , continue treatment undergo third MRI within 25 day prior surgery . All patient OS Ewing sarcoma undergo pre-operative chemotherapy eligible study . Anti-neoplastic therapy determine primary physician impact upon study , although data make available physician involve patient 's care . The goal study : 1 ) To determine pre-operative dynamic contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) reliably predict percent necrosis definitive surgery bone tumor induction chemotherapy . 2 ) Evaluate hypothesis patient Ewing osteogenic sarcoma ( OS ) , priori early ( 18-24 day treatment ) DCE-MRI study predict pathological percent necrosis measure surgery , disease free survival . 3 ) Determine DCE-MRI result independent marker tumor response compare current clinical marker ( LDH , alkaline phosphatase ( osteogenic sarcoma ) , primary disease site , primary disease size ( length volume ) , stage ) . 4 ) Compare DCE-MRI result several key molecular parameter include p53 mutation CDKN2A deletion Ewing 's sarcoma RB alteration , CDKN2A deletion , expression HER-2 , platelet derive growth factor , reduce folate carrier , pglycoprotein osteogenic sarcoma . Ewing 's sarcoma osteogenic sarcoma sample also submit Affymetrix expression microarray analysis . Summary : This project determine potential DCE-MRI predict tumor necrosis priori early marker tumor response neoadjuvant therapy</detailed_description>
