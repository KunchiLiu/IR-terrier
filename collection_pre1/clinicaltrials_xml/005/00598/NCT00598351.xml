	<brief_summary>This study examine long-term progress patient neurofibromatosis Type 2 ( NF2 ) , condition associate tumor nerve , brain spinal cord . It study patient tumor learn fast grow certain factor might affect growth . It also examine effect tumor patient ability carry activity daily live . People 8 75 year age NF2 may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : Initial evaluation , include hearing , eye balance testing , gait ( walk ) testing , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain spine , blood test , physical neurological examination . MRI scan brain spine every 6 month follow size number tumor . Physical neurological examination blood test every 6 month . Auditory test every 12 month . These test evaluate middle inner ear function patient ability hear tone different frequency hear word different volume . The subject respond tone word deliver earphone . Eye examination every 1 2 year . Gait test every 12 month spinal cord tumor cause problem sensation muscle control arm legs Subjects joint measure walk across room several time scientific camera record movement . Vestibular test patient experience change balance undergoes treatment vestibular schwannoma ( tumor develop hear balance nerve ) . These test check function various component balance system ( eye , inner ear , leg body sensation muscle ) . They include : - Videoelectronystagmogram Tracks subject eye movement follow move red light eye . - Vestibular evoke myogenic potential Assesses subject neck muscle movement response noise . - Posturography Determines part balance system subject relies . Subjects stand platform try maintain balance change make platform environment . - Rotary chair test Subjects eye movement monitor follow red spot strip light eye seat rotary chair turn side side several speed .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Study Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type 2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective The objective prospective natural history study neurofibromatosis type 2 ( NF2 ) gain clinical molecular insight effect tumor suppressor syndrome tumor development progression identify factor link symptom evolution . Study Population Two hundred fifty patient , age 8-75 , clinical genetic diagnosis NF2 participate study . Design Study participant evaluate thorough physical neurologic examination upon enrollment . This initial outpatient evaluation include ophthalmologic examination , magnetic resonance image contrast craniospinal axis , NF2 research blood procurement serum biomarker test . Patients measurable hear audiology assessment perform initial visit . Patients untreated vestibular schwannomas vestibular assessment perform initial visit . Whole genome/whole exome sequencing may perform blood tissue obtain subject enrol study surgery relate study . Patients tumor affect speech swallow production see speech language pathologist follow visit , standard clinical assessment speech swallow function do . In patient tumor affect independent functioning associate activity daily live , physical therapy occupational therapy assessment perform follow visit . Subjects follow outpatient five year , clinical , radiologic serum biomarker evaluation perform annually . Auditory test perform annually patient measurable hearing . Patients initially untreated vestibular schwannomas follow annually vestibular test . Ophthalmologic evaluation perform every one three year , depend severity ocular lesion . Peri-operative speech swallow reassessment perform medically indicate , tumor may affect ability treat . Functional status test repeat peri-operatively annually thereafter tumor may affect independent functioning treat . If clinical symptom attributable NF2-associated lesion progressive nature warrant treatment intervention , test may repeat frequently . Outcome measure Based data derive study , hope identify factor predict tumor development , forecast tumor growth underlie symptom formation . These finding permit safe treatment subset tumor cause symptom avoid unnecessary treatment lesion remain stable ( require treatment ) patient . Moreover , prospective natural history study useful identifying stochastic factor underlie biology tumor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All patient clinical diagnosis NF2 establish clinical criterion genetic testing . Males female age 8 75 . Capacity undergo serial MRI scan CNS . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Clinically unstable condition precludes serial clinical imaging evaluation ( i.e . Class 3 congestive heart failure , severe chronic renal insufficiency , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) . Allergy relative contraindication MRI contrast agent . Contraindication MRI scan surgery involve metal clip wire , might expect cause tissue damage produce image artifact . Patients severe chronic renal insufficiency ( glomerular filtration rate le 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) , hepatorenal syndrome postliver transplantation . Patients pregnant time intake visit .</criteria>
