	<brief_summary>This pilot study randomize , placebo-controlled , clinical trial test safety use intravenous form Prostaglandin E1 ( PGE1 ) inhale form treatment hypoxemic respiratory failure term newborn . The study plan enroll 50 infant diagnosed hypoxemic respiratory failure nine NICHD Neonatal Research Network sit , randomly assign receive one dose 72-hour period either high concentration PGE1 ( 300 ng/kg/min ) , low concentration PGE1 ( 150 ng/kg/min ) , placebo ( normal saline , diluent drug ) . In addition determine safety , optimal dose , duration therapy , pilot trial plan evaluate feasibility conduct large , multi-center randomize , blind placebo-controlled trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inhaled PGE1 Neonatal Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoxemic respiratory failure ( HRF ) , frequently associate persistent pulmonary hypertension newborn ( PPHN ) , rare , life-threatening condition affect approximately 2 9 percent infant admit neonatal intensive care unit result significant morbidity mortality . It occur often full- post-term baby whose circulatory system adapt well breathe outside womb . HRF may result congenital hernia diaphragm , group B streptococcal infection , inhale meconium womb , respiratory distress syndrome . Medical treatment , high frequency ventilation , inhale nitric oxide , Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation ( ECMO , heart lung support machine ) , significantly increase survival child HRF . These therapy , successful , however , variety side effect potential long-term disability . This feasibility trial design test safety use intravenous form Prostaglandin E1 inhale form ( iPGE1 ) infants born 34 0/7ths week gestational age great diagnosed hypoxemic respiratory failure assist ventilation . The intravenous form PGE1 aerosolize administer via nebulizer attach infant 's ventilator . The goal enroll 50 subject within 6-9 month , preparation large , multi-center randomize control trial ; however , study withdraw lack recruitment .</detailed_description>
