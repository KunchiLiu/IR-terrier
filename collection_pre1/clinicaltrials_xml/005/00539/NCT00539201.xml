	<criteria>The subject healthy . Healthy , judge responsible physician , clinically significant abnormality identify medical laboratory evaluation , include 12lead ECG . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range age group may include Investigator considers find introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . The subject ≥18 ≤65 year age . The subject male female . A female eligible enter participate study nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , physiologically incapable become pregnant ) , include female : Has hysterectomy Has bilateral oophorectomy ( removal ovary ) Has bilateral tubal ligation Is postmenopausal ( demonstration total cessation menses ≥ 1 year date screen visit ) . An FSH level perform confirm postmenopausal state . For study FSH level ≥ 40mIU/mL consistent menopause . If subject estrogen replacement menopausal status questionable , estrogen replacement discontinue 2 week subject rescreened , estrogen replacement suppress FSH . A male eligible enter participate study surgically sterile OR either agree abstain sexual intercourse female partner agree use condom/spermicide , addition female partner use another form contraception , IUD , occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicide , oral contraceptive , injectable progesterone , subdermal implant , female condom , contraceptive patch , contraceptive vaginal ring , tubal ligation hysterectomy .

The subject able understand comply protocol requirement , instruction protocolstated restriction likely complete study plan . As result medical interview , physical examination , screen investigation , Investigator considers subject unfit study . The subject 's systolic blood pressure outside range 90140mmHg , diastolic blood pressure outside range 4590mmHg heart rate outside range 50100bpm female subject 45100bpm male subject . History/evidence symptomatic asymptomatic arrhythmia , angina/ischemia , coronary artery bypass graft surgery percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty clinically significant cardiac disease . History/evidence clinically significant pulmonary disease . Has positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen ; positive HCV antibody ; positive HIV1 antibody result . Has history regular alcohol consumption average &gt; 7 drinks/week woman &gt; 14 drinks/week men ( 1 drink ( 12 g alcohol ) = 5 ounce ( 150 ml ) wine 12 ounce ( 360 ml ) beer 1.5 ounce ( 45 ml ) 80 proof distil spirit ) within 6 month screen visit . Unwilling abstain alcohol 72 hour prior start dose collection final pharmacokinetic sample treatment period . Has history regular use tobacco nicotinecontaining product within 3 month screen visit . The subject positive prestudy drug and/or alcohol screen . Unwilling refrain use illicit drug adhere protocolstated restriction participate study . The subject receive investigational drug participate research trial within 30 day 5 halflives , twice duration biological effect drug ( whichever longer ) prior first dose current study medication . Participation study would result donation blood excess 500 mL within 56 day period . History presence allergy intolerance study drug component drug class , history drug allergy , opinion physician responsible , contraindicate participation . This include subject history know suspected sulfa relate hypersensitivity . In addition , heparin use PK sample , subject history sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia enrol .

Use prescription nonprescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication , unless opinion Investigator sponsor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , total bilirubin , serum creatinine value great upper limit normal hemoglobin outside normal range screening . A single repeat allow eligibility determination . Subjects preexist condition interfere normal gastrointestinal anatomy motility , hepatic and/or renal function , could interfere absorption , metabolism , and/or excretion study drug . Subjects history cholecystectomy exclude . Subjects , history , gastritis peptic ulcer disease exclude . History significant renal hepatic disease . History Gilbert 's syndrome . Subjects positive immunoassay fecal occult blood test prior start dose study drug ( repeat dose cohort ) Exclusion Criteria : 24Hour Screening Holter : Any symptomatic arrhythmia ( except isolate extra systole ) . Sustained cardiac arrhythmia ( atrial fibrillation flutter , SVT , complete heart block ) . Nonsustained sustain ventricular tachycardia ( define ≥ 3 consecutive ventricular ectopic beat ) . Any conduction abnormality ( include specific leave right incomplete complete bundle branch block , AV block [ 2nd degree high ] , WPW syndrome etc. ) . Sinus Pauses &gt; 2.5 second . 300 supraventricular ectopic beat 24 hour . 250 ventricular ectopic beat 24 hour .</criteria>
