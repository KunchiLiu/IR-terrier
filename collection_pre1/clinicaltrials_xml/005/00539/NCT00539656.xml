	<brief_title>Transplantation Umbilical Cord Blood Following Chemotherapy Blood Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The success BMT curative option patient malignancy frequently limited inability identify appropriate donor time transplantation . Transplantations utilize umbilical cord blood stem cell increasingly successful . Data suggest few less developed T-cells cord product compare bone marrow likely produce less graft-vs.-host disease ( GVHD ) even mismatch set . In addition , graft easily available second ease collection compare source bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSCs ) . The ability build cord blood repository contain sample HLA type minority continue increase likelihood find suitable product represent minority African-Americans , Hispanic population mixed ethnic population . Unfortunately , limitation remain , secondary time engraftment cell dose less optimal , result delay fail engraftment . In addition , increase cell dose appear associated disease free survival . Therefore , modality transplant generally limited small patient . This protocol evaluate infusion engraftment two cord blood product - one expand ex vivo one expand follow myeloablative chemotherapy treatment hematological malignancy . Primary Objective : -To evaluate safety transplantation two cord product include expand unit include infusional toxicity potential immunologic competition . Secondary Objective : -To determine use two cord product result improvement neutrophil engraftment ( ANC &gt; 500 ) subject demonstrate engraftment &lt; =21 day . Tertiary Objectives : Patients compare patient participate trial institution receive therapy per standard care . - To evaluate rate , extent , durability hematopoietic reconstitution particular determine relative contribution cord unit early engraftment long-term engraftment - To estimate rate severity graft-vs-host disease - To estimate rate infectious complication - To obtain preliminary data regard disease-free overall survival - To collect sample future study immune reconstitution future study laboratory regard disease immune system We able track fate unmanipulated expanded CB progenitor evaluate difference cord product recipient evaluation sex mismatch , HLA type and/or restriction length polymorphism ( RFLPs ) . If expand CB cell detect patient long-term , give u confidence use expand CB sole hematopoietic progenitor cell support , future study . The major risk non-engraftment either one cord blood unit . Non-engraftment one unit may lead prolonged cytopenia mark increase risk infection . Failure either unit engraft define failure detect cell either cord blood product Day +60 likely result death subject . There possibility failure long-term engraftment cord . This would fatal unless alternative donor option identify unlikely event autologous reconstitution bone marrow . There possibility immune competition cord blood product . This could result loss cord product would responsible long term engraftment . There possibility expand cord product fail release test . In event , unexpanded cord would infuse would likely result delayed engraftment . As cellular product risk associated infusion include limited anaphylaxis , transfusion reaction , hemolysis , side-effects DMSO product store ( bradycardia , hypothermia , neurologic change ) . The expanded product wash however remain small chance small amount growth factor remain . The risk associate allergic . Busulfan toxicity 1 . Nausea vomit 2 . Myeloablation 3 . Pulmonary complication 4 . Seizures 5 . Other toxic effect may produce Busulfan erythematous skin rash , hyperpigmentation , hepatic dysfunction , amenorrhea , testicular atrophy , gynecomastia , myasthenia symptom , cataract atrophic bronchitis associate cytologic dysplasia . Cyclophosphamide Toxicity 1 . Leukopenia , anemia 2 . Alopecia 3 . Nausea , vomit , increase AST , ALT , mucositis , diarrhea 4 . Headache , dizziness 5 . Cardiac necrosis rarely high dose cyclophosphamide 6 . Hemorrhagic cystitis , SIADH 7 . Teratogenic , may cause secondary neoplasm , anaphylaxis ( rare ) 8 . Fluid retention . 9 . Cardiomyopathy . 10 . Hemorrhagic Cystitis . At dos use uroprotection mesna virtually non-toxic . However , adverse effect may attributable mesna include nausea vomiting , diarrhea , abdominal pain , alter taste , rash , urticaria , headache , joint limb pain , hypotension fatigue . Total Body Irradiation Toxicity : 1 . Nausea Vomiting 2 . Alopecia 3 . Parotitis Pancreatitis 4 . Diarrhea 5 . Fever 6 . Erythema 7 . Hyperpigmentation 8 . Mucositis 9 . Late Effects - cataract formation , growth retardation , carcinogenesis probability sterilization .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must two cord unit available .

Lymphoma ( Hodgkins NonHodgkins ) ineligible Autologous BMT Myelodysplastic Syndrome Able provide inform consent parent/guardian able provide inform consent .
