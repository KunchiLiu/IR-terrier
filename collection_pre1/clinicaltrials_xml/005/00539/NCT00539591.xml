	<brief_title>Phase II Study Incorporating Pegylated Interferon In Treatment For Children With High-Risk Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study child malignant melanoma high risk feature ( high risk melanoma return spread part body ) recurrent disease . The study two treatment group base stage disease . Patients stage IIC , IIIA IIIB melanoma whose tumor remove surgery treat study group A . These patient receive 4 week high dose interferon alfa-2b follow 48 week peginterferon . Patients stage IIIC IV melanoma , stage III melanoma could remove surgery recurrent disease treat study group B . These patient receive peginterferon alfa-2b temozolomide . Stratum A : Resected Stages IIC , IIIA , IIIB patient Induction therapy ( week 1-4 ) : Subjects receive recombinant interferon alfa-2b 20 million units/m2 per day intravenously 20-30 minute 5 consecutive day per week 4 week . Subjects receive peginterferon alfa-2b 1 mcg/kg/week subcutaneously total 48 week . Stratum B : Resected Stage IIIC , unresectable Stage III , Stage IV , recurrent patient Stratum B divide 2 group base presence ( Stratum B1 ) absence ( Stratum B2 ) measurable disease . Subjects receive 8 weekly dos peginterferon alfa-2b 0.5 mcg/kg/dose subcutaneously combination temozolomide 75mg/m2/dose mouth daily 6 week follow 2 week break . The duration treatment course 8 week . Strata B2 ( measurable disease ) proceed 7 course outline . Surgery intervention -Associated Strata A B Surgery description : All subject initial presentation melanoma ( T1-4 ) treat primary wide local excision minimum 1cm margin ( anatomically feasible ) surround primary lesion biopsy scar . For lesion Breslow 's thickness &gt; 1mm &lt; or= ulceration Clark 's level IV/V , 2 cm margin prefer anatomically feasible . Subjects sentinel lymph node ( ) positive disease , undergo complete lymph node dissection involve nodal basin . Additional objective include : - To assess safety temozolomide administer combination peginterferon α-2b pediatric patient resect AJCC Stage IIIC , unresectable Stage III , metastatic , recurrent cutaneous melanoma ( Stratum B ) . - To study feasibility safety administer peginterferon α-2b weekly 48 week follow initial induction phase intravenous high dose interferon α-2b 4 week pediatric patient resect thick melanoma ( &gt; 4mm ) ulceration ( AJCC Stage IIC ) resect melanomas regional lymph node metastasis ( AJCC Stage IIIA IIIB ) ( Stratum A ) .</detailed_description>
