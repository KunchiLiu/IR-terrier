	<detailed_description>This study utilize 6-week open-label design test CES treatment GAD . The study fund Saban Family foundation . The devise provide Electromedical Products Inc. ( EPI ) technology company manufacture cranial stimulators . This company relationship investigator study . There explicit implicit conflict interest . Participants recruit August 2005 March 2006 UCLA Anxiety Disorders Program Semel Institute Human Behavior . Permission UCLA 's Institutional Review Board obtain conduct study . All eligible subject provide approved write consent prior initiation study related procedure . Patient Selection : Male female outpatient age 18 64 year eligible current diagnosis GAD . At screening , GAD diagnosis confirm conduct MINI interview . ( Sheehan , Lecrubier et al . 1998 ) Patients score ≥ 16 Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HARS ) &lt; 17 17-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) baseline consider enrollment . ( Hamilton 1959 ; Hamilton 1960 ) Lower usual HARS permit include milder case GAD . Patients exclude primary diagnosis meeting DSM-IV criterion Axis I disorder GAD , patient meet DSM-IV criterion mental retardation , pervasive developmental disorder neurological impairment . Also exclude recent ( 6 month ) history current diagnosis drug alcohol dependence abuse , current suicidal ideation and/or history suicide attempt personality disorder sufficient severity interfere participation study . Other exclusion criterion include history presence medical disease might compromise study detrimental patient . Women pregnant breastfeed woman childbearing potential practicing reliable form contraception also exclude study use psychotropic medication . Patients permit stable , therapeutic dose SSRI SNRI take medication least 3 month still symptomatic least 3 month treatment . Patients use PRN as-needed benzodiazepine permit enter study use medication exceed two time per week . Women pregnant breastfeed woman childbearing potential practicing reliable form contraception also exclude study . Study visit conduct baseline end 3 6 week treatment . Patients meet eligibility criterion baseline enrol administered CES treatment . Results : Fifteen subject express interest study engage initial telephone screen . Eight percent ( n=3 ) participant deem ineligible participate . Reasons ineligibility include age ( n=1 ; 3 % ) psychiatric co morbidity ( n=2 ; 6 % ) . Twelve subject enrol received CES treatment . The mean age sample 42.83±10.7 year . Of twelve individual enrol study 9 ( 75 % ) female 3 ( 25 % ) male . Five participant ( 41.6 % ) take psychotropic medication least 3 month prior enrollment continue throughout study ; two participant take venlaflaxine remain 3 patient take benzodiazepine as-needed basis twice week ( 2 take alprazolam , 1 take lorazepam ) . Overall , 75 % patient ( n=9 ) complete study . Three subject discontinue baseline due adverse event , include dizziness ( n=2 ) headache ( n=1 ) . A significant change ( 11.5 point ) find baseline endpoint HARS score ( t= 8.59 p= 0.001 ) . The mean change baseline significant 2 week treatment continue increase time . At endpoint , 6 ( 66 % ) 9 patient 50 % decrease HARS score 1 2 CGI improvement , consider responder treatment . An additional patient improve meet criterion response . Mean HDRS score change 10.5±15.01 baseline 6±3.64 endpoint ( t= 3.01 , p=0.01 ) . A significant change also find baseline ( 30.3±11.49 ) endpoint ( 23.3±6.76 ) UCLA 4D Anxiety Subscale score ( t=2.63 , p= 0.03 ) . Results current study demonstrate significant improvement CES , decrease HARS score similar find clinical trial antidepressant anxiolytic medication . ( Katz , Reynolds et al . 2002 ; Rickels Rynn 2002 ; Pollack , Meoni et al . 2003 ; Sheehan Mao 2003 ; Bielski , Bose et al . 2005 ; Brawman-Mintzer , Knapp et al . 2006 ; Dhillon , Scott et al . 2006 ) . The effect size 2.4 appear large . However , expect open trial part part effect could due placebo response . The cited study effect size placebo range 0.74 approximately 1.72 . Most recent pharmacological study GAD observe large placebo response make imperative conduct placebo-controlled sham-controlled study fully evaluate treatment effect population ( Rickels Rynn 2002 ) The patient generally like treatment 3 continue use devise experiment purchase CES stimulator . However , 3 subject experience side effect cause withdraw prematurely study . Presence side effect patient could sign physiological effect patient need studied future study .</detailed_description>
