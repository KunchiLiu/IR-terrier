	<brief_title>Non Invasive Multicenter Italian Study Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because coronary artery disease ( CAD ) frequent cause death industrialize nation onset currently unpredictable , need new method screen apparently healthy individual identify increase risk . Several image technique use visualize coronary artery . These include invasive procedure x-ray coronary angiography non invasive like compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Among image modality , selective cardiac catheterization x-ray angiography current gold standard visualization coronary detection stenosis , provide optimal spatial resolution , general `` road map '' coronary tree intervention . The replacement even fraction procedure non-invasive modality would constitute important advance care patient suspect coronary artery disease Preliminary result report literature address study coronary artery multidetector-CT ( MDCT ) appear interest . Several study perform firstly use Electron beam CT ( EBCT ) .EBCT provide high temporal resolution enables quantitative assessment coronary artery calcium , limited spatial resolution result limit z axis resolution , permit direct visualisation multi-reformation whole coronary artery system . With introduction 4-row MDCT several study aim compare MDCT standard invasive angiography . Data publish 200 subject 4 study demonstrate patient compliance breath-hold , heart rate rhythm crucial limitation procedure . In Nieman Achembach paper coronary segment assessable limited temporal resolution 4-slice MDCT . With machine mandatory select patient carefully , consider baseline hearth rate &lt; 65 bpm ( also obtain pre-treatment β-blockers order slow hearth rate ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients ( men woman ethnic group ) schedule coronary angiography evaluation diagnostic work . 2 . Patients expect undergo coronary angiography within 2 week MDCT study procedure . The coronary angiography must meet minimum standard lay protocol ( see section 8.3.3 ) . 3 . Patients must HDL total cholesterol perform within last year . 4 . Patients must willing able continue study participation follow reference test ensure completion procedure observation require study . 5 . Fully inform sign consent must obtain patient . 1 . Patients 18 year age . 2 . Patients receive investigational drug within 30 day prior enter study . 3 . Pregnant lactating woman . 4 . Patients contraindication MDCT examination iodinate contrast medium . 5 . Patients heart rate &gt; 70 bpm despite βblocker treatment ( see section 8.2.4.1 ) . 6 . Patients sinus rhythm . 7 . Patients NYHA III IV class . 8 . Patients previously undergone CABG stenting . 9 . Patients creatinine value &gt; 2 mg/dl .</criteria>
