	<brief_summary>Epidemiological study definitively show fruit vegetable consumption positive health specifically cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) prevention . In France , among fruit , frequently consume citrus fruit essentially juice specifically orange juice . However , health effect poorly study far . Citrus fruit contain vitamin C associate various phytomicronutrients i.e . carotenoid ( essentially -cryptoxanthin ) polyphenols . Each fruit contain specific compound : hesperetin orange , naringenin grapefruit , eriodyctiol lemon . Some scientific study perform either vitro animal model demonstrate property micronutrient could contribute positive health effect citrus fruit vascular protection . However data still miss . The main goal project characterize effect orange juice consumption vascular disease risk factor evaluate specific role micronutrient compound ( polyphenols carotenoid ) protection . To reach goal , randomize `` cross-over '' clinical study perform volunteer present mild hypercholesterolemia . They consume 4 week orange juice reconstitute drink similar orange juice composition carbohydrate , mineral , vitamin C folates without phytomicronutrients . The effect juice consumption vascular function monitor explore lipid abnormality plasma , measure endothelial vasoreactivity ( FMD ) ( Flow Mediated Dilatation ) , well endothelial dysfunction , thrombosis , inflammation oxidative stress biomarkers plasma . Comparison urinary metabolomes orange juice consumption reconstitute drink lead identification metabolic pathway modulate orange juice micronutrient . Moreover ELISA test two major flavanones citrus fruit ( hesperetin naringenin ) develop . They use determine plasma level molecule order analyze relation `` ingested quantity - bioavailable quantity - physiological effect '' . The result obtain project allow clarify citrus fruit effect , particularly orange juice , vascular protection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Scientific context : Arteriosclerosis chronic pathogenic inflammatory-fibro-proliferative process large medium-sized artery result progressive formation fibrous plaque turn , impair blood flow vessel . These lesion either promote occlusive thrombosis affect artery ( heart attack , thrombotic stroke ) produce gradual relentless stenosis arterial lumen . A number subtle dysfunction occur cellular molecular level early stage disease progression associate loss cellular homeostatic function endothelial cell , smooth muscle cell macrophages constitute major cell type atheroma environment . Several epidemiological study show negative association consumption polyphenol-rich food ( fruit vegetable ) CVD . This association partially explain fact polyphenols interrupt lipid peroxidation implicate initiation arteriosclerosis . Polyphenols contribution prevention CVD could attributable antioxidant capacity , hypolipidemic and/or anti-inflammatory property well effect metabolic pathway . Among fruit , citrus fruit interest source polyphenols ( flavanones glycoside ) carotenoid . A single glass orange juice may contain 40 140 mg flavanones , may significantly contribute total daily polyphenol intake high citrus consumer . The clinical evidence role citrus fruit consumption prevention cardiovascular disease concern hypocholesterolemic effect improvement biomarkers oxidative stress , specific protective role phytomicronutrient provide beverage never consider . According type citrus , flavanone molecule different : hesperetin orange clementine , naringenin grapefruit eriodyctiol lemon . These molecule show display antioxidant hypolipidemic effect . Citrus also contain various carotenoid , like violaxanthin , lutein etcâ€¦ well cryptoxanthin act pro-vitamin A positive role CVD prevention . The specific health benefit bring phytomicronutrients unknown clinical study specific design assess contribution citrus micronutrient perform yet . Moreover , polyphenols carotenoid able affect expression gene involve atherogenesis . The interaction molecules cellular response particular interest . In fact , could interplay cellular antioxidant network directly ( synergistically antagonistically ) affect gene expression . The unravellings mechanism regulation transcriptional control gene expression seem promising future line investigation . Newly develop high throughput technology make significant contribution integrative biology . Studies phytomicronutrients use analysis functional genomics analysis phenotypes metabolic still infancy . Integrated database necessary understand biological function . The translation basic scientific discovery apply nutrition increase challenge . Social economic context : CVD adult main cause morbidity mortality Western country . In France , CVD responsible 170 000 death year i.e . 32 % death , represent total public heath expenditure estimate 7.9 % . As epidemiological study show protective effect fruit vegetable consumption towards CVD incidence , National Programme Nutrition Health set France advice least 400g consumption fruit vegetable per day , equivalent 5 item crude cook fruit vegetable . The present project give solid background understand molecular mechanism beneficial effect polyphenols human health . Scientifics socio-economics goal : Scientific goal clearly establish effect phytomicronutrient consumption orange juice vascular risk factor . This orange juice intake take place French traditional control diet . This mean project deal nutritional prevention one major cause death health cost France . It involve one popular source citrus fruit . This goal reach interventional clinical study . The final aim present project give diffuse nutritional advice citrus fruit consumption towards consumer , make fruit juice producer aware interest optimize content juice phytomicronutrients . Originality new concept : Primary originality present project focus specific contribution phyto-micronutrients fraction citrus ( polyphenols carotenoid ) within natural food matrix cardiovascular protection . Such approach elicit conduct cross randomize study include experimental design regular intake orange juice compare consumption beverage mimic composition orange juice . This control beverage contain main nutrient orange juice ( carbohydrate , Vit C , Mg++ , K+ , folates ) except polyphenols carotenoid . It well establish CVD closely associate endothelial dysfunction . Thus present study focus endothelium evaluate functional ( FMD ) systemic ( plasma endothelial biomarkers ) parameter . Selected biochemical parameter usually measure clinical study demonstrate metabolic effect study nutrient . However , approach properly deal complexity interaction occur nutrient multiplicity biological target . The metabolic approach offer novel opportunity investigate impact complex food whole physiology human organism , elucidation subtle highly significant metabolic change . The present project highlight potentiality metabolic technology study health effect complex food dietary pattern free-living population . Disposition data micronutrient bioavailability ( plasma level ) biological , biochemical physiological effect allow establish correlation study `` ingested-circulating-physiological effect '' .</detailed_description>
