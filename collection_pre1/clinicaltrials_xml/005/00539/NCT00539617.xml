	<brief_title>Chemotherapy &amp; Erlotinib Treating Patients w/ Esophageal Gastroesophageal Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 50 % patient advanced esophageal cancer present disease remove surgery spread part body . Improved therapy patient advanced esophageal cancer therefore urgently need . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) inhibitor erlotinib ( combination chemotherapy ) lead improve survival patient pancreatic lung cancer . EGFR target esophageal cancer therapy since overexpression associate aggressive disease poor survival . Early study show clinical activity EGFR inhibitor disease alone combination chemotherapy . This study aim explore safe effective treatment erlotinib FOLFOX patient advance esophageal gastro-esophageal cancer .</detailed_description>

Acceptable method birth control include oral hormonal contraceptive barrier method ( e.g. , condom , diaphragm ) use combination method ( e.g. , spermicide ) . Male patient capable fathering child must avoid participate study use acceptable method birth control . This precautionary measure study involve chemotherapy agent . Presence Kras mutation . Lack expression EGFR . Prior treatment EGFRinhibiting agent , chemotherapy , radiotherapy esophagogastric carcinoma ( neoadjuvant treatment note inclusion criterion ) . Patients must receive investigational agent . Use erythropoietin allowable . Secondary prophylaxis granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( GCSF ) ( Filgrastim ) allowable . Concomitant use phenytoin , carbamazepine , barbiturate , rifampicin , phenobarbital , St. John 's wort . Uncontrolled brain metastasis . Patients must uncontrolled intercurrent illness time registration include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina , pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .
