	<brief_title>Autologous Bone Marrow-derived Mononuclear Cells Therapeutic Arteriogenesis Patients With Limb Ischemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although safety beneficial effect intramuscular transplantation bone marrow derive mononuclear cell procedure appear well document , number critical question regard application BM-MNC peripheral vascular disease remain answer . First , although original study partially perform semi-blinded study ( patient double sided claudication recruit blindly treat BM-MNC one leg peripheral blood injection leg ) , approach exclude placebo effect . Second , although patient mild diabetes include protocol , result diabetic patient analyze separately . Diabetic disease characterize monocyte endothelial progenitor cell dysfunction still unclear whether approach also effective diabetic patient . Third , although six-month result report long-term efficacy establish yet . To address issue , investigator propose confirm extend finding open study randomize double-blind study patient severe claudication critical leg ischemia pay special attention influence diabetic disease outcome study possible pro-atherogenic/ pro-inflammatory effect BM-MNC injection .</detailed_description>
