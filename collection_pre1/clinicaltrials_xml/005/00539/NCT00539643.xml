	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect block blood vessel tumor liver small bead alone ( Bead Block ) versus block bead contains release doxorubicin ( chemotherapy agent ) . The reason study see add doxorubicin kill tumor would kill block blood supply tumor . The chemotherapy , doxorubicin , use many year treat patient cancer . This procedure block blood vessel call embolization . Embolization common treatment patient liver cancer surgery . The investigator compare standard treatment ( use small bead alone ) another least good , possibly well ( addition drug , doxorubicin ) . There guarantee new treatment well possible might side effect ( related doxorubicin ) see standard treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Beads Versus Doxorubicin Eluting Beads Arterial Embolization Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biocompatibles LC Bead ( also know DC Bead Asia &amp; Europe ) microspheres preformed soft , deformable microspheres may load doxorubicin use occlude blood flow cancerous tumour . LC Bead microspheres consist macromere derive PVA . The fully polymerize microsphere approximately 90 % water compressible approximately 30 % diameter . The microspheres deliver conventional catheter ( 4-5Fr ) micro-catheters 2-3Fr range . These microspheres , like agent use arterial embolization , mixed radiographic contrast prior administration order allow fluoroscopic control embolization procedure .</detailed_description>
