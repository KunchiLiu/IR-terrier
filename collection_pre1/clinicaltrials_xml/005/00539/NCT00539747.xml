	<detailed_description>Huntington Disease ( HD ) progressive neurological condition , eventually lead death . Presymptomatic , predictive genetic test inform individual genetic status . A positive genetic test result threaten event . In adapt threatening event people often try find meaning experience . Meaning make refers attempt understand event experience significance context one 's life . The search mean eventually lead acceptance event experience , consider important component adaptation . Although establish test HD significantly stressful event , mean make frequent response towards adaptation , little known process among individual face positive genetic test result HD . This study describe mean make population presymptomatic individual positive genetic test result HD . Semi-structured interview conduct , record , transcribe , analyze . A typology common theme compile report . Data gather interview improve understand phenomenon mean make population , contribute exist literature role mean make cognitive adaptation .
