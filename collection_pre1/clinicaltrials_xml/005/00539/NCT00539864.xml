	<brief_title>Safety Reactogenicity FluBlok Comparison Immunogenicity , Efficacy Effectiveness Against TIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Annual influenza epidemic associate serious excess morbidity mortality , particularly among elderly . Licensed trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( TIVs ) show reduce hospitalization death follow influenza vulnerable population , efficacy lower observed young , healthy population . In addition , recent study question level effectiveness TIV elderly , suggest cohort study overestimate benefit immunization current TIV formulation age group . In view consideration , widely accept improved alternative vaccine need control seasonal pandemic influenza . Currently available TIVs prepare virus grow embryonated hen ' egg . Alternative substrate vaccine production desirable order reduce vulnerability expand influenza vaccine supply . Recombinant DNA technique allow expression influenza hemagglutinin ( rHA ) baculovirus vector insect cell culture . Advantages technique include speed production , absence egg protein , highly purified product . Previous study among healthy young old adult confirm rHA vaccine safe , well tolerate immunogenic dosage nine time higher contained TIV . Dose-related increase serum antibody level immunization also observe .</detailed_description>
