	<detailed_description>Natural age relate decline testosterone ( T ) associate decrease cognitive ability independent health status . Low T level time associate increase risk develop Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . These finding suggest men low T level risk age-related cognitive decline AD therefore likely benefit T supplementation prevent development AD age-associated cognitive decline . The current study ass cognition , mood , cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) biomarker response T supplementation old men mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) low T level . Participants randomize either receive T treatment placebo six month . Participants come five visit within span six month complete cognitive &amp; memory test , fill mood questionnaire , blood drawn monitor medication level . A sample blood also take one visit test apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) , genetic risk factor associate AD . Participants option get spinal tap order measure biological marker associate Alzheimer 's disease include beta-amyloid 1-40 , 42 , total-tau , phosphorylated-tau-181-231 . This require additional two visit .</detailed_description>
