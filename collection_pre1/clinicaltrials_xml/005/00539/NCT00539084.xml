	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether MicronJet microneedle device effective inducing rapid painless local anesthesia prior insertion intravenous catheter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Assess Safety Efficacy Microneedle Device Local Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Local anesthesia routinely administer reduce patient discomfort improve outcome wide variety painful medical procedure . However , injection local anesthetic agent skin use regular needle painful . Therefore , common procedure involve needle prick ( e.g . venipuncture ) may quite painful usually perform without local anesthesia . NanoPass develop microneedle injection device ( MicronJet ) enable painless delivery drug directly superficial layer skin . The objective study ass safety efficacy device intradermal injection local anesthetic agent insertion intravenous catheter healthy adult . Each subject receive injection local anesthetic one arm , control placebo injection physiological water arm . Both injection administer intradermally use MicronJet . Following injection , intravenous catheter insert injection site arm , subject rate pain cause insertion . Safety parameter record throughout study .</detailed_description>
