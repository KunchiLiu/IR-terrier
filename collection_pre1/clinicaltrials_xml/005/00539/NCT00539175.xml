	<detailed_description>â€¢ PURPOSE , METHODS , AND PROCEDURES : 1 . Purpose : 1 . To assess efficacy Photon Stimulation compare placebo , treat pain diabetic neuropathy . 2 . To show Photonic Stimulation treatment painful diabetic neuropathy cost effective compare traditional medical intervention . The latter explore extensive search literature equal number patient treat traditional medical practice use traditional medical intervention . At conclusion study data analyze cost-benefits possibility craft best-practices approach treat syndrome cost billion dollar year health care expense lose productivity . 2 . Methods This double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study approximately 170 patient painful diabetic neuropathy . The study sample size 170 patient . Of 120 give treatment utilize Photon Therapy , use define treatment protocol . We plan recruit 120 patient allow drop , provide 100 complete patient , request FDA . The Photon Therapy group split two group , one group receive Active Photon Therapy one group treat type equipment modify emit infrared photon ( Non Active Photon Therapy Group ( `` Placebo '' ) ) . The patient `` Non Active Photon Therapy Group '' offer Active Photon Treatment Session completion study . The patient Photon Therapy Groups randomize . The Historical Control Group patient , fifty , receive traditional medical intervention ( e.g. , narcotic , seizure medication ) traditional medical practice . 3 . Procedures : Subjects meet inclusion exclusion criterion sign valid informed consent eligible participate study . After screen , subject Photon Therapy group ( active nonactive ) undergo four treatment session . The first treatment session vary second , third fourth . During treatment session , patient image TIP Infrared Camera , treatment . Infrared image visualize skin temperature change noninvasive manner ( 2 ) . The first treatment utilize slightly different protocol subsequent visit , reduce Photon dosage , 120 instead 240 joule . Proprioception protective sensation , characterize Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test , visual analog pain score also evaluate Photon Therapy treatment . - SUBJECT SELECTION : Subjects initially recruit PI 's clinic , list patient diagnose Dr. Beckley ( Electromyographer ) painful diabetic neuropathy , local referral . In October 2004 , receive permission post flyer solicit patient ( identify Dr Beckley ) primary provider ( fly letter attach ) . We also recruit post flyer VANCHCS facility , VANCHCS diabetes educator . Word mouth also provide many subject . In September 2006 modify flyer reflect focus recruitment Mather . Vulnerable population study . - RISKS : The potential risk subject include physical , psychological , social economic . These likely : The physical risk include discomfort photon machine . The psychological risk include boredom . The social risk include label chronic illness , risk loss privacy . The economic risk include time work may need participate treatment program . Confidentiality maintain much possible , store paper data lock office , without name identifier , electronic data spreadsheet password-protected computer lock office . - BENEFITS : Individual subject may derive benefit via pain relief ; would also obtain whole group patient painful diabetic neuropathy . - RISK-BENEFIT RATIO : The risk minimal , benefit minimal moderate ( potentially great ) . - SAFETY MONITORING : Research staff monitor safety . - INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURES : The PI ( Dr. Swislocki ) staff ( Ms. Orth , Ms. Weisshaupt ) conduct , obtain , document inform consent within VANCHCS facility . - PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTIONS : Confidentiality maintain much possible , store paper data lock office , without name identifier , electronic data spreadsheet password-protected computer lock office . - COSTS TO SUBJECTS : No added expense expect . No compensation propose . - DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL AND FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THE RESEARCH STUDY AND SPONSOR : The Principal Investigator personal financial interest research personal financial interest entity .</detailed_description>
