	<brief_summary>The proposal seek establish : - A comprehensive compilation ( database ) clinical information comprise clinical , histopathological , treatment follow-up characteristic past future gastrointestinal cancer ( GIC ) case Singapore share investigator . The characteristic include clinical ( eg age , sex , stage ) , histopathological ( eg . grade , type ) , treatment ( eg . treatment status , regimen ) outcome data ( eg . survival , toxicity ) medical record . - A collection ( bank ) correspond frozen fix tissue , blood process sample ( enrich blood mononuclear cell , protein , RNA , DNA , tissue array ) Singapore share investigator . - A gastrointestinal cancer co-operative group ( GCCG ) clinicians scientist research prognostic predictive marker GIC , benefit multidisciplinary knowledge , information sample member .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One current difficulty management GIC decision treat type treatment select . Tumour stag histopathological assessment provide indication likely aggressiveness cancer hence need treat ; however even within specific disease stag histopathological type much variability disease outcomes sub-categorization desirable . For type treatment select , currently establish criterion , despite fact much inter-individual variability response rate occurrence drug toxicity . Currently also become increasingly important issue number available regimen GIC chemotherapy 5-FU , capecitabine , irinotecan , oxaliplatin , gefitinib , erlotinib , cetuximab , bevacuzimab either alone combination recently increase , make treatment selection even difficult . There clearly need additional prognostic ( predictive disease aggressiveness ) predictive ( predictive likely response treatment ) indicator GIC . In 10 year devote develop prognostic predictive marker different laboratory clinic Australia , Singapore , Europe USA , PI gain deep experience take run successful program development prognostic predictive marker ( Soong et al . 1996 , Soong et al . 2000 , Mattison et al . 2002 ) . Firstly need comprehensive database link clinical , histopathological , treatment outcome characteristic case . This provide multiple functional endpoint understand significance candidate marker complete overview likely influencing factor . Secondly need collection sample link database suitable test candidate marker . In regard , type sample analyze also critical : In last year , distinction prognostic predictive marker find increasingly important ( Elsaleh et al . 2000 ) . Some cancer may aggressive ( poor prognosis ) respond well treatment give appearance good outcome , others may relatively benign ( good prognosis ) resistant treatment , give poor outcome . Without take consideration , marker consider marker poor prognosis may actual marker poor treatment response good prognosis , possible misleading permutation . The method clearly delineate prognostic predictive significance define : Prognostic significance marker determine examine association survival patient without treatment . Predictive significance determine compare survival patient treatment without patient subgroup without candidate marker . The significance clearly develop prognostic predictive marker , investigator need group case receive treatment . Since mid-1990s , chemotherapy become mainstay advanced GIC cancer consider unethical treat , imply way accurately assess marker prognostic predictive significance analyze sample pre-mid 1990s record treatment status , obtain archive fixed tissue collection . The sample consideration integrate well clinical practice , prognostic predictive marker preferably analyzable non-invasive sample able proven prospective analysis . The collection minimally-inconveniencing blood sample would serve purpose , sufficient sample size available validation future prognostic predictive marker , would provident begin collection early possible . Thirdly , sufficient statistical power understand complexity disease various angle expertise management GIC , cross-department -institutional collaboration necessary . These factor go proposal specific objectives current protocol give .</detailed_description>
