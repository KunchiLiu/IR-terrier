	<brief_title>Automated Real-time Feedback CPR Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A subset emergency medical service ( EMS ) agency participate Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium ( ROC ) adopt new monitor/defibrillators capable monitor CPR process attempt resuscitation patient cardiac arrest , well provide automate real-time feedback process EMS provider improve compliance recommend guideline CPR . Monitoring CPR process attempt resuscitation important step towards reduce potential poorly-performed CPR modify effect study intervention upon outcome . Clusters form rig , individual agency group agency randomize turn feedback . After fixed period time , cluster cross arm . An unequal number subject enrolled period .</detailed_description>
