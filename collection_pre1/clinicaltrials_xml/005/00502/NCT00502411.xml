	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination radiation therapy plus low dose doxorubicin chemotherapy give surgery effective treatment sarcoma . The safety treatment also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-Operative Chemoradiation Extremity &amp; Trunk Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Doxorubicin drug commonly use treat certain kind cancer . The radiation treatment chemotherapy start around 4-6 week surgery . During study , receive radiation treatment 5 day week 6 - 61/2 week . On Day 1 week radiation therapy , give doxorubicin continuous injection vein 4 day row . A special tube place large vein neck chest region large vein arm . This call central venous line . A small pump use give drug . This pump size pack cigarette . You receive appropriate instruction maintenance pump . The doxorubicin radiotherapy give outpatient basis M. D. Anderson . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may stop may take study . At time , doctor discus treatment option . Before start week treatment , physical exam blood test ( around 2 tablespoon ) . You also MRI check status disease . After study , follow-up visit M. D. Anderson every 3-4 month first 2 year study every 6 month next 3 year . After follow-up visit year rest life check status disease . At every follow-up visit ultrasound scan . You MRI first follow-up visit doctor feel necessary . This investigational study . Doxorubicin FDA approve commercially available . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
