	<brief_title>Short Course Interferon Treatment Patients With HCV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION 1.1 Hepatitis C Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) major cause chronic hepatitis hepatic fibrosis1 . Acute infection advance chronicity 80 % patient , progress cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma significant number1 . Hepatitis C global problem , prevalent industrialize well develop world2 . It major cause chronic liver disease ( CLD ) Pakistan surpass hepatitis B single important cause cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) Pakistan 3 . 1.2 Study Medications A combination interferon ribavirin therapy standard care world-wide past years1 , 2 . Standard treatment duration 24 week genotype non 1 , 48 week genotype 12 . 1.2.1 Interferon Alfa 2a Interferon Alfa first drug show bioactivity HCV . Combining ribavirin interferon Alfa find effective interferon Alfa mono-therapy previously untreated patient well patient relapse one course interferon Alfa therapy2 . 1.2.2 Ribavirin Ribavirin guanosine analogue inhibits vitro replication wide range RNA DNA viruses1 . The mechanism antiviral activity fully define , although may involve alteration cellular nucleotide pool inhibition viral RNA synthesis1 , 4 . Ribavirin monotherapy little effect replication HCV result normalization serum ALT activity improvement liver histology . However , relapse occurs nearly patient treat ribavirin alone1 . Combining Ribavirin Interferon find effective Interferon monotherapy treatment chronic hepatitis C. In large clinical trial 1121 patient , sustain virological response ( SVR ) achieve 53 % patient treat Interferon plus Ribavirin compare 29 % patient treat Interferon alone1 , 4 . 2 . RATIONALE Most treatment related study HCV come West , prevalent genotype 1 ; result however necessarily reflect outcome develop country like Pakistan , study already confirm prevalent genotype 32 . Success rate globally report high treating genotype 3 : long observe patient infected genotype 2 3 respond well interferon therapy patient infect genotype 11 , 3 . Favorable prognostic factor identify predict good response therapy treatment chronic HCV . These include : - Younger age - Genotype 3 - No cirrhosis liver biopsy , - Absence alcohol drug abuse1 , 7 . Few study investigate efficacy short course therapy patient favorable predictive factor ; study use interferon monotherapy4 , 5 , others use combination treatment short duration relapse patients6 . There evidence combination treatment may beneficial use induction therapy , follow interferon short course program , 7 . Cases infect HCV genotype 3 treat little 4-12 week remain sustained responder reported8 Since HCV genotype 3 responds well combination interferon Ribavarin , suggest patient population may similar response shorter duration therapy7 , 8 , 9 . The efficacy short course interferon Ribavarin combination therapy compare long course therapy compare treatment patient favorable predictive factor . 2.1 Rationale Dosage Selection 1.2.2.1 Interferon Alfa 2a The dose choose interferon Alfa 2a ( 3 million unit thrice weekly , sc ) dose currently approve Pakistan combination therapy ribavarin1 . 1.2.2.2 Ribavarin The dose choose Ribavarin ( 800-1200 mg per day ) dose currently approve Pakistan combination therapy interferon patient HCV.1 3 . HYPOTHESIS In patient chronic hepatitis C infection favorable predictive factor treatment , short course combination therapy interferon Ribavarin equally efficacious long course treatment . 4 . OBJECTIVE To determine whether 16 week interferon Ribavarin therapy effective 24 week therapy achieve sustain virological response patient favorable predictive factor infect HCV genotype 3 . 5 . SIGNIFICANCE Pakistan enormous burden chronic HCV infection . The cost treatment prohibitive unaffordable large proportion population2 , 3 . A short course therapy comparable standard regimen would significant implication ; strike decrease financial burden health care system country , well patient reduction patient exposure medication , result decrease treatment related adverse effect . In addition large number patient able afford treatment due decrease treatment duration turn overall cost .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult male nonpregnant female ( 18 less equal 50 year age ) . Treatment na√Øve patient . Serological evidence hepatitis C infection antiHCV antibody test HCV PCR positive Genotype 3 Absence cirrhosis liver biopsy . Absence alcohol drug abuse . Patients consent include study . Pregnant breast feeding female . Patients hemoglobin &lt; 10g/dl , ANC &lt; 1500c/mm , platelet count &lt; 90000c/mm . Genotype non 3 HCV PCR positive end 4 week treatment . Presence cirrhosis liver biopsy . Decompensated liver disease . History evidence medical condition associate chronic liver disease CHC ( e.g. , hemochromatosis , autoimmune hepatitis , metabolic liver disease , alcoholic liver disease , toxin exposure ) History receive IFN , PEGIFN , RBV therapy previously . History systemic antiviral therapy investigational drug 3 month prior first dose study treatment . Patients expect need systemic antiviral therapy time participation study . Exceptions last two exclusion criterion patient limit ( less 7 day ) course acyclovir valacyclovir herpetic lesion 1 month prior first administration trial treatment .</criteria>
