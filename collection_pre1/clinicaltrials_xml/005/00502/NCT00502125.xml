	<detailed_description>The study take place M. D. Anderson . Examinations perform cancer prevention , head neck dental clinic , operate room patient get schedule surgery part standard care . Abnormal look area ( lesion ) inside mouth may sign cancer change may lead cancer . Researchers look practical way tell early whether lesion cancer may become cancer . This study look technique call reflectance confocal imaging . Participants study examination mouth . A photograph take abnormal area inside mouth . Then small probe , size large ink pen , place gently one two abnormal appear area , one normal appear area inside mouth . The probe expose oral line small amount light . Some light reflect back probe , pick computer . Pictures make tissue . A small amount vinegar place site cotton swab probe place . The procedure take 1-2 minute site . A small sample tissue site , normal abnormal , remove . The biopsy do normal tissue do study part standard care . The sample remove either time surgery local anesthesia clinic . Briefly , small area biopsied numbed topical anesthesia injection local anesthesia . Then small amount tissue , big pencil eraser , remove sterile surgical instrument . This cause little discomfort bleeding . The tissue place special fluid look special microscope . The tissue sample examine microscope pathologist learn tissue cancerous precancerous . These result compare picture make line mouth . You tell experimental finding . The pathology review tissue remove available treat physician patient care . THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY . The device use reflectance confocal image investigational device . It consider non-significant risk device FDA use research . A total 22 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
