	<brief_summary>Women history prior preterm birth ( PTB ) high probability recurrent preterm birth . Some risk factor health behavior contribute PTB may amenable intervention . Home visitation promise method deliver evidence base intervention . We evaluate system care design reduce preterm birth hospital length stay sample pregnant woman history PTB . All participant ( N = 211 ) receive standard prenatal care . Intervention participant ( N = 109 ) also receive home visit certify nurse-midwives guided protocol specific risk factor ( e.g. , depressive symptom , abuse , smoke ) . Data collect via multiple method source include intervention fidelity assessment . Average age 27.6 year . Racial breakdown mirror local demographic . Most woman partner , high school education , Medicaid . Enhanced prenatal care nurse-midwife home visit may limit risk factor shorten intrapartum length stay woman prior PTB .

	<detailed_description>Preterm birth ( PTBs ) lead cause death infant age one . Tennessee ( TN ) one low rank state US rate PTBs ( 46th ) infant mortality ( 48th ) . Costs neonatal care increase exponentially decrease gestational age , lifelong consequence family community . Despite medication improve diagnostic tool , 27 % increase PTBs occur past 20 year . With history one PTB , probability another PTB approximately 30 % . The risk another PTB rise almost 70 % woman history one PTB . Relationships variety factor ( e.g. , African American race , smoking , short interval pregnancy , socio-environmental stressor ) likely contribute TN 's high rate PTBs . Several intervention identify reduce PTBs improve maternal infant health indicator vary success ; administer intramuscular injection progesterone 16 36 week gestation , provide prenatal care home woman high risk pregnancy , increase interval pregnancy , reduce social factor negatively impact health , smoking , substance abuse stress . The overall purpose study determine combine medical biobehavioral intervention would prevent PTBs reduce healthcare cost sample woman prior PTB . The medical intervention conventional prenatal postpartum clinic care . The biobehavioral intervention include certified nurse midwife home visitor engage woman integrated System Care ( SOC ) prenatal care . Care continue first 18 month infant 's life maternal-child nurse visitor . Home visit addition regularly schedule conventional prenatal postpartum clinic care . Main study question : Is difference : 1 ) length gestational age infant high-risk pregnant woman receive medical intervention high-risk pregnant woman receive SOC ? 2 ) health care cost woman receive medical intervention SOC ? 3 ) interval current pregnancy subsequent pregnancy across group ? 4 ) length gestational age current infant gestational age index prior preterm birth ?</detailed_description>
