	<detailed_description>Introduction . After episode acute respiratory failure require mechanical ventilation , wean patient ventilator may difficult . Discontinuation ventilation estimate take 40 % total duration ventilatory support . Approximately two- third patient disconnect ventilator spontaneous breathe trial . Prolongation mechanical ventilation may increase risk adverse event infection increase morbidity mortality . Identifying wean readiness early reliably therefore crucial . Weaning protocol develop assist identify wean readiness show shorten duration mechanical ventilation , notably wean period . Closed loop knowledge-based system serve continuously apply wean process automatically reduce ventilatory assistance accord patient ability indicate patient ready disconnection . No data use computer driven system ( CDS ) elderly patient require prolonged ventilation weaning center ( non ICU ) report . Objective : To evaluate ability computer driven system predict wean readiness compare physician-directed protocol . The CDS continuously adapt pressure support , gradually decrease ventilator assistance accord patient ability , thus indicate wean readiness . Patients maintain spontaneous breathe 7 day follow weaning consider successfully weaned mechanical ventilation . Design setting : A single center , randomize , control clinical study Beit Rivka regional weaning center ( RWC ) . Patients . This study conduct Beit Rivka geriatric rehabilitation hospital , Petah Tikva . Written inform consent obtain patient legal representative . The study include 60 consecutive patient meet inclusion criterion stabilization acute health problem prompt admission referral hospital . Inclusion criterion follow : pressure support ventilation ( PSV ) least 48 h , plateau pressure le 30 cmH2O , PEEP &lt; 6 cmH2O , PaO2/FIO2 ratio &gt; 150 SaO2 &gt; 94 % FIO2 &lt; 0.5 , pCO2 &lt; 55 mm Hg normal patient &lt; 65 Hg patient COPD , requirement inotropic support , body temperature &gt; 36.50C &lt; 38.50 C , stable neurological status Glasgow Coma Score ( GCS ) &gt; 6 , HgB &gt; 8 mg % , systolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mg Hg , mean arterial pressure &gt; 65 mg Hg , absence sedative medication availability CDS time patient admission switch pressure support ventilation ( PSV ) . Patients young 60 old 85 year age , patient chronic ventilatory assistance home , patient decision limit life-sustaining treatment exclude . Treatment group assignment seal envelope upon admission hospital . Attending doctor blind treatment group . Description computer driven system . The CDS knowledge- base system embed ventilator ( EVITA XL ) ( 15 , 16 , 17 ) . It achieve three main goal . First , CDS continuously adjust PSV level base respiratory rate ( RR ) , tidal volume ( Vt ) end-tidal partial pressure CO2 ( PETCO2 ) acquire ventilator real time average 2 min . Adjustment patient keep within `` comfort zone ” define RR 15-30 range ( 34 within patient neurological disorder ) , Vt great 300 ml ( &lt; 250 ml body weight &lt; 55 kg ) , PETCO­2 le 55 mm Hg ( &lt; 65 mmHg patient COPD ) . Second , CDS gradually decrease ventilatory assistance reduce PSV level least 30 min stable ventilation within comfort zone ; reduction 2 4 cm H20 depend whether initial level 20 cm H2O , respectively . Third , CDS evaluate wean readiness : PSV level reach preset minimal value ( 9 cm H2O tracheotomized patient ) , CDS start observational period , serve automatic spontaneous breathe trial . After uninterrupted ventilation minimal PSV level 1 2 h ( depend whether initial PSV level 15 cm H2O ) , CDS display message patient ready disconnect ventilator . The investigator perfect knowledge system . Prediction wean . Weaning readiness evaluate CDS internist record daily , i.e. , every morning 10 11 a.m . The decision consider take CDS physician take 1 day advance , i.e. , precede morning . Physicians aware PSV level deliver CDS could take level account evaluation . Weaning protocol use routinely center recommend daily assessment wean similar use CDS . Patients declare weaned soon physician CDS predict wean readiness . The control group reflect standard care CDS implementation . PS 10 cm H2O high set manually . After 20 min , absence sign poor tolerance , PSV reduce 4 2 cm H20 ( depend initial PSV level &gt; &lt; 20 ) . If poor tolerance wean evident , progression weaning stop , patient reassess 20 min later reduction PSV . The PSV level decrease 9 cm H2O . In case apnea , SIMV reinstituted . If evaluation satisfactory , patient disconnect ventilator . The patient closely monitor sign respiratory failure require reinstitution mechanical ventilation , well occurrence complication . RWC length stay MV record . Clinical characteristic include age , sex , anthropometrical data , APACHE II score , Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) , Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS ) , Mini Nutritional Assessment ( MNA ) , temperature , ny concomitant medication , hand grip strength record . Expired tidal volume , respiratory rate , Peak airway pressure , mean airway pressure , Compliance , Resistance , respiratory frequency tidal volume ratio ( f/Vt ) , Negative Inspiratory Pressure ( NIP ) , Maximal Inspiratory Pressure ( MIP ) , Minute Ventilation ( MV ) , inspiratory time record . Other element relevant mechanical ventilation management include arterial blood gas estimation , number change setting ventilator perform health care worker , number transition control assisted ventilation , number apnea high pressure alarm . The primary outcome variable duration mechanical ventilation . Discontinuation MV attempt primary physician judge patient ready wean , accord standard criterion . Mechanical ventilation reinstituted following circumstance : respiratory rate 35 breath /min , P02 65 mm Hg FIO2less 0.6 , ph 7.34 less , heart rate equal 1 10 beat min Increased 20 % , arrhythmias appear , systolic blood pressure without inotropes &lt; 90 mmHg 20 % usual blood pressure , uncoordinated thoraco-abdominal movement , activation accessory muscle , agitation depress mental status , excessive sweating . A wean trial consider failure patient tolerate wean trial , patient still use CDW day 60 patient require reconnection MV . Weaning trial consider successful spontaneous breathing sustain 168 h ( 7 day ) disconnection MV .</detailed_description>
