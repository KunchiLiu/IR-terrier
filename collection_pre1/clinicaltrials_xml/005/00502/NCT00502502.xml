	<detailed_description>One way learn symptom chemoradiation therapy look certain protein call cytokine ( find blood ) change therapy . Another way look think memory may change treatment . Before therapy start , ask complete several questionnaire visit Radiation Oncology clinic M. D. Anderson . These questionnaire measure physical emotional symptom . These questionnaire take 30 minute finish . Lung cancer patient also complete cognitive ( mental ) questionnaire . During visit , research nurse teach use telephone system measure symptom . You tell system convenient time telephone call . The date call close date weekly clinic visit . Before begin chemoradiation treatment , sample blood drawn ( around 2½ tablespoon ) . The sample blood use measure level cytokine blood pre treatment . You 2½ tablespoon blood draw start chemoradiation , week receive treatment . These cytokine may relate symptom experienced treatment cancer . These blood test do study level cytokine blood , treatment cancer . Symptoms monitor weekly use interactive voice response telephone system . During chemoradiation , automate telephone system call week ask rate symptom much symptom interfere daily life . The information collect call use research study . At end chemoradiation , lung cancer patient give questionnaire measure cognitive symptom . For lung cancer patient post-chemotherapy , symptom monitor weekly 3 month therapy use interactive voice response telephone system . For esophageal , gastric , colorectal , anal patient post-therapy , symptom monitor weekly 6 week therapy use interactive voice response telephone system . About 30 day chemoradiation , 2½ tablespoon blood draw regularly schedule clinic visit . If schedule 3 month clinic visit , contact local physician blood lab result . This investigational study . About 225 evaluable patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
