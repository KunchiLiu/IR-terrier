	<brief_title>3-Dimensional Form Soft Tissue Biomechanics Breast</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients participate study general physical demographic information record . Height , weight , age , race , menstrual status , bra size record . Patients breast physical exam . Researchers perform several painless test image study evaluate mechanical property skin shape tissue composition breast . Patients study go series evaluation list . 1 . 3-D Optical Surface Scan ( estimate time require : 5 minute ) The camera system safe scan laser use take 3-D digitize image breast chest . Multiple image may necessary get complete rendering breast . Each image require less 0.6 second take . This process similar routine photography currently perform patient . 2 . Mechanical testing ( estimated time require : 1 hour ) A small device apply surface skin several location breast . A mild suction apply several second measurement . This measure skin tend stretch . The instrument use sensitive provide information need small , painless amount movement skin . In addition evaluate characteristic breast skin , one additional measure take skin front forearm area help understand general skin quality . 3 . Skin Ultrasound ( estimate time require : 15 minute ) Patients cutaneous ultrasound use 20 MHz machine skin thickness record domain . A trained technician complete exam . In addition evaluate characteristic breast skin , one additional measure take skin front forearm area help understand general skin quality . 4 . Breast MRI and/or CT ( estimate time require : 1 hour ) Some patient schedule imaging breast chest use MRI and/or CT . These image take free-of-charge required standard care . Participation evaluations complete . This investigational study . A total 200 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson . After first 50 patient enrol , result study see study continue . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Female 2 . Greater 18 year old . 3 . Presenting complaint require breast physical examination . 4 . Free connective tissue disorder cutaneous malignancy breast . 5 . Free medical condition contraindicate MRI CT scan . 6 . Willing participate study able complete inform consent . 1 ) Patients meet inclusion criterion .</criteria>
