	<brief_summary>To obtain data evaluate whether multispectral digital image assist clinician screen premalignant lesion oral cavity . Our system illuminate tissue monochromatic light excite fluorescence , polarized white light generate reflectance , expose abnormality real time , clinical diagnosis . Primary Objectives : 1 . To compare fluorescence image oral mucosa lesion , obtain 350 nm , 380 nm , 400 nm , 450 nm excitation , standard white light image pathologic analysis biopsied tissue . 2 . To compare reflectance image oral mucosa lesion , obtain use broadband polarize light , standard white light image pathologic analysis biopsied tissue . 3 . To develop algorithms discriminate normal abnormal tissue 4 . To analyze image determine type optical information ( combination thereof ) yield diagnostically useful data</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All tissue cell make tiny particle give small amount light . This light call fluorescence . Scientists learn cancerous cell normal cell give different amount different type fluorescence . Scientists need good understand whether fluorescence oral cavity ( mouth ) use tell cell abnormal . This information help doctor detect pre-cancers . In order well understand fluorescence , researcher Optical Spectroscopy Imaging Lab , Department Bioengineering , Rice University develop instrument collect analyze fluorescence without surgically remove tissue touch tissue . This instrument take picture oral cavity fluorescence microscope . The instrument also take regular live picture . Scientists hope study picture well understand difference fluorescence normal abnormal cell . The instrument standard medical microscope similar one use doctor office examine people 's ear . Researchers attach special light source microscope provide different color light . In addition , microscope digital camera attach researcher record see different light color . In study , clinician use instrument take picture suspicious normal oral cavity lesion . A small sample oral lesion ( 2-4 mm , size small eraser ) remove biopsied area image . A portion suspicious normal area take pathology evaluation . The biopsy normal appear area biopsy additional receive part standard care . Each participant 2-4 biopsy perform , depend upon many area examiner feel may suspicious . Most people take part study surgery remove lesion oral cavity anyway , biopsy perform time surgery . For participant schedule surgery , biopsy perform local anesthesia clinic . All data numerically cod ensure confidentiality . In addition picture take biopsy , brief interview perform clinical research staff discuss possible past local therapy personal history tobacco alcohol use . The interview take 10 minute complete . You tell experimental finding . Information confirm diagnosis make available treating physician . After visit tissue collection , participation study complete . This investigational study . A total 45 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
