	<brief_summary>Arterial calcification within coronary vessel greatly accelerate among patient chronic end-stage kidney disease . The mechanisms lead increased calcification unknown , include hyperphosphatemia , hyperparathyroidism alter vitamin D metabolism . Moreover , recent data demonstrate circulate carboxy fragment PTH ( 7-84 ) physiologic antagonist intact PTH ( 1-84 ) may directly contribute vascular calcification . Current PTH assay distinguish intact carboxy PTH fragment lead overestimation intact PTH level . Because second generation PTH assay detect 1-84 7-84 PTH fragment , use vitamin D analogue treat secondary hyperparathyroidism could lead excessive suppression 1-84 preponderance carboxy PTH fragment . Moreover , increase administration vitamin D analogues amy contribute vascular calcification . To investigate question , plan investigate effect manage new ESRD patient use conventional third generation PTH assay vitamin D administration development coronary calcification . Hypothesis # 1 : Clinical management secondary hyperparathyroidism new hemodialysis patient use Scantibodies 1-84/7-84 PTH ratio one year reduce amount Vitamin D administration result reduced coronary calcification compare patient PTH management accomplish conventional , second generation PTH assay .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients chronic renal failure increase risk vascular calcification cardiovascular complication . For example , data USRDS database demonstrate 42 % death among chronic dialysis patient cardiovascular origin 22 % death due arrhythmias overt acute myocardial infarction . While numerous factor include hypertension , hyperlipidemia diabetes contribute renal failure coronary disease , recent study find patient CKD experience accelerate rate coronary calcification . Medial calcification reduces compliance medium large elastic artery aorta common carotids . The resulting loss elasticity think contribute high prevalence systolic hypertension leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) among patient ESRD 15 . The type vascular calcification associate diabetes ESRD histologically distinct find atherosclerotic plaque . In patient CKD diabetes calcium deposit concentric uniformly distribute within medial layer vessel wall . The deposition calcium require presence atherosclerotic lesion occur absence intimal hyperplasia . Infiltration adventia T cell activate macrophage lead expression bone morphogenetic protein 2 ( BMP-2 ) osteopontin ( OPN ) pericytic myofibroblasts . In diabetic , BMP-2 expression enhance simultaneous upregulation two BMP-2 associated transcription factor Msx1 Msx2 3 . The result transcription BMP-2 gene lead mineralization non-endochondrial matrix . The expression OPN consistent feature medial calcification 4 . Osteopontin `` bone bridge '' highly phosphorylated glycoprotein bind calcium integrin receptor . The expression osteopontin stimulate vitamin D increase circulating level phosphate . Moreover , physiologic concentration 1 , 25 , dihydroxyvitamin D increase calcium deposition culture vascular smooth muscle cell associate reduced expression PTH relate peptide ( 1-34 PTH ) suggest amino PTH fragment involve regulate bone turnover , also function prevent dystrophic vascular calcification . Indeed , observation raise question whether carboxy PTH fragment accelerate vascular calcification . Because second generation PTH assay detect 1-84 7-84 PTH fragment , use vitamin D analogue treat secondary hyperparathyroidism could lead excessive suppression 1-84 preponderance carboxy PTH fragment . As observed Jono et.al accumulation 7-84 could contribute excessive vascular calcification . We hypothesize limit accumulation 7-84 PTH fragment maintain 1-84/7-84 ratio 1.6 reduce amount vitamin D analogue administer ultimately reduce development coronary calcification . To investigate hypothesis , propose prospectively treat 50 patient 1 , 25 dihydroxyvitamin D2 dos determine maintain 1-84/7-84 ration &gt; 1.6 maintain intact PTH level 150-350 pg/ml use exist second generation PTH assay . 4.0 Hypothesis &amp; Objectives 4.1 Hypothesis # 1 : Clinical management secondary hyperparathyroidism new hemodialysis patient use Scantibodies 1-84/7-84 PTH ratio one year reduce amount Vitamin D administration result reduced coronary calcification compare patient PTH management accomplish conventional , second generation PTH assay . 4.1a Specific Aim # 1 Specific Aim # 1 compare amount coronary calcification percentage patient least one coronary lesion &gt; 50 % luminal obstruction baseline one-year therapy follow randomization one two treatment group . [ Group 1 ] Patients randomize group 1 administration 1alpha OH vitamin D2 ( Hectorol ) target achieve serum PTH level 150-300 ng/ml use Bayer Centaur iPTH assay . [ Group 2 ] Patients randomize group 2 administration vitamin D analogue target achieve ratio 1-84/7-84 PTH fragment range 1.4-1.6 use Scantibodies IRMA PTH assay . ( Hectorol ) . Rationale : Coronary calcification frequent complication end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) recent estimate 80 % chronic hemodialysis patient exhibit moderate severe vascular calcification 1 . Numerous clinical factor associate development arterial calcification include hyperphosphatemia 2 , diabetes mellitus 3 calcium contain phosphate binder 4 . More recently , increase use vitamin D analogues treat secondary hyperparathyroidism implicate major contributor vascular calcification among ESRD patient . These clinical practice complicate observation carboxy fragment PTH ( e.g . 7-84 ) cross react second generation PTH assay . Because carboxy PTH fragment either inert antagonize functional bio-intact PTH ( 1-84 ) , clinician use excessive dos vitamin D analogue regulate PTH level . Moreover , animal model study suggest carboxy PTH fragment directly contribute vascular calcification 16.We propose clinical decision make use incomplete information provide currently available second generation PTH assay lead excessive vitamin D administration subsequent acceleration coronary calcification . Anticipated Results : We anticipate prolong ( 1 year ) management PTH level use second generation PTH assay lead increase total administer dose vitamin D analogue . Moreover , increase vitamin D administration result increase coronary calcification end one year therapy . Conversely , maintain 1-84/7-84 PTH ratio 1.4-1.6 use Scantibodies third generation assay reduce amount administer vitamin D analogue subsequently reduce amount coronary calcification one year .</detailed_description>
