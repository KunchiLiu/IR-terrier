	<brief_title>Topotecan Irinotecan-Refractory SCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current commonly use second-line approach SCLC include re-induction first-line therapy chemosensitive disease , single-agent topotecan . Although efficacy topotecan second-line chemotherapy SCLC consistently demonstrate number clinical study , choice irinotecan first-line therapy prevent use evidence-based option topotecan . Topotecan irinotecan cytotoxic agent inhibit intracellular pathway , namely topoisomerase I , enzyme involved DNA replication RNA transcription . Although mechanism action similar , preclinical clinical data two drug notable difference . Topotecan irinotecan different spectra antitumor activity various model human cancer . Clinical data support agent may different spectrum activity . The difference antitumor activity may also reflect different mechanism resistance . Furthermore , topotecan irinotecan different limit toxicity ( myelosuppression diarrhea , respectively ) .</detailed_description>
