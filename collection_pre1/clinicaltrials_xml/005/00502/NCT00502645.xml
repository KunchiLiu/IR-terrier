	<brief_summary>This single-center , open , non-controlled clinical investigation 10 patient Medical University Graz include treatment visit ( V1 ) follow visit ( V2 ) . In treatment visit ( V1 ) admittance ICU arterial blood glucose value monitor either software-algorithm eMPC use adjust infusion rate intravenously administer human soluble insulin normalise arterial blood glucose . The purpose present study investigate performance already develop test algorithm combination newly develop bed-side , touch screen user interface ( CS-1 decision support system ) patient medical ICU period 72 hour . Follow information ( V2 ) acquire hospital discharge late one week visit 1 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before begin trial related activity , relatives patient ask patient ever mention past , he/she want participate kind clinical study . If say patient past sign make likely patient would participate , he/she exclude trial . After test inclusion exclusion criterion , screen information obtain begin trial . A screening number assign patient ascend order . The following data record case record form ( CRF ) : Check inclusion/exclusion criterion , demographic data , medical ( include diabetes ) history relevant medication , body weight heightand laboratory analysis routine laboratory assessment . Patients fulfil inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion include trial subject number assign ascend order . Routine intensive care provide department internal medicine . Trial related activity interfere regular patient care . Blood sample retrieve arterial line , available routine diagnostic monitoring procedure patient . At time 0 , blood glucose measurement take , manually enter CS-1 decision support system insulin infusion rate time next glucose reading suggest computer-based system . Based suggestion system , insulin infusion pump routinely use ICU manually set suggest insulin infusion rate specially train ICU staff staff feel safe suggestion . Intravenous infusion human soluble insulin start . For safety reason : In case suggest measurement interval decision support system exceed 90 minute interval , interim glucose measurement take . All measurement document CRF . Only case blood glucose value 40 mg/dl additional interim-glucose value also put CS-1 system . However , nurse staff time decide take additionlal blood glucose measurement and/or neglect decision suggest system . The target range blood glucose level 80-110 mg/dl [ 4.4 – 6.1 mmol/l ] . The current blood glucose level insulin infusion rate continuously document CS-1 decision support system supervise investigator . Glucose value provide system manual entry . In case hypoglycaemia , intravenous insulin infusion stop glucose administer via intravenous bolus . The treatment visit , include trial related activity describe , last 72 hour . Adverse event relevant medication continuously monitor document The Acute Physiology Chronic Health Evaluation Score ( Apache II ) document patient begin trial . There physical connection algorithm suggest insulin infusion rate insulin infusion pump algorithm would capable independently steer insulin infusion . There also physical connection glucose measurement device algorithm algorihthm would able independently get glucose measurement . For safety reason , glucose measurement insulin infusion rate parameter need manually enter specially trained nurse . For glucose measurement , certify device ICU application use ( Accuchek® Inform ; Roche Diagnostics ) , intravenous insulin infusion , certify insulin infusion pump ( Perfusor® Space , BBraun Melsungen ) use routine condition ICU use . Follow information acquire hospital discharge late one week visit 1. .</detailed_description>
