	<detailed_description>Scientific Background Anesthesia surgery stressful situation cause neuro-endocrine , metabolic neurological response . Cancer surgery may cause decrease anti-angiogenic factor , enable dissemination tumor cell manipulation tumor blood vessel , well local systemic secretion growth hormone , immune suppression . The magnitude response depend many factor , include extent tissue injury , technique anesthesia type analgesia , transfusion , temperature change , psychological stress genetic factor ( 1-3 ) . The tissue damage start cascade local systemic process include secretion hormone cytokine ( 1 ) . Post operatively , suppression several immune function occurs , may last week . The cellular immunity undergoes suppression , humoral immunity remain almost entirely intact ( 1 ) . These change cell mediate immunity may impact systemic resistance infection well metastatic process . Specifically , NK cell pivotal role defense neoplastic process . Studies show high level activity NK cell associate long term survival ( 1 ) . Therefore , understand process cause post-operative immune suppression , prevention suppression , clinical significance . Several substance secrete surgery think contribute immune suppression general NK cell dysfunction particular . These include prostaglandin , catecholamine , steroid endorphin , show suppress several immunological function vitro ( 1 ) . Animal study show administration prostaglandin catecholamine rat suppresses NK cell activity vivo , association elevate susceptibility metastasis 4-6 ) . In rat undergo laparotomy , peri-operative administration beta- adrenergic blocker together COX-2 inhibitor significantly abrogate NK cell suppression well enhanced susceptibility metastasis surgery ( 4,7 ) . The mechanism effect prostaglandins catecholamine NK cell elucidate ( 1 ) : beta- adrenergic receptor prostanoid receptor cell membrane cause elevate level intra-cellular cAMP activate ligand , turn interferes NK cell cytotoxic activity cancer cell viral pathogen . Since elevate intra-cellular level cAMP cause type receptor independently , blockade one pathway enable increase intracellular cAMP level via pathway , effect suppression cytotoxic activity . Therefore , simultaneous blockade pathway may effective . Research rat directly support hypothesis ( 7 ) . Cells immune system express mostly beta-2 adrenergic receptor , less degree beta-1 receptor ( 9 , 10 ) , pharmacological blockade require use non specific blocker block type receptor . The beta-antagonist propranolol choose experiment since non specific beta-blocker , capable block type receptor , well extensive clinical experience drug fact relatively safe drug . The COX-2 inhibitor choose Etodlac ( Etopan ) , advantage selective COX-2 inhibitor , synthesized injury inflammation , little effect COX-1 enzyme , associate ongoing maintenance tissue . Anesthetics opiate analgesic also cause NK cell suppression . Research animal human show morphine fentanyl cause suppression NK cell activity , enhance susceptibility breast cancer metastases rat ( 11,12 ) . Lower dos opiates patient report decrease immune suppression magnitude duration ( 13 ) . Therefore , peri-operative intervention decrease use opiate ( endogenous secretion ) may clinically important factor cancer recurrence . In addition immune suppression , endogenous exogenous opiate ( endorphin morphine , fentanyl ) implicate promote metastatic spread neoplastic proliferation via mechanism : - Catecholamines report increase VEGF secretion human cancer cell , enhance tumor cell invasion ( 14-16 ) . - Morphine cause increase proliferation human tumor cell enhance tumor vascularization ( 17 ) - COX2 inhibitor enhance sensitivity human tumor cell induction apoptosis , decrease capillary density cancer tissue ( 18 , 19 ) . Therefore , minimization peri-operative opiate use prevention blockade prostaglandin catecholamine effect may delay metastatic process development exist micro-metastases . A retrospective clinical study publish 2006 indirectly support propose study : In study breast cancer patient treat per-operatively COX inhibitor ( diclofenac ) along local blockade sympathetic pain pathway ( paravertebral anesthesia ) . These treatment doubt lower use opiates surgery . Among patient thus treat three fold decrease recurrence rate find three year surgery ( 21 ) . Of note , study quote previously mention study rat ( 6,22 ) involve intervention . AIM The aim propose study examine whether peri-operative administration COX2 inhibitor beta- adrenergic blocker decrease immune suppression surgery , decrease stress hormone pro-angiogenic factor secretion , associate decrease cancer recurrence rate . The peri-operative variable examine include number activity NK cell blood , level Th1 Th2 cytokine , stress hormone pro-angiogenic factor , Th1 2 cytokine production leukocytes response vitro stimulation . As part clinical monitoring meticulous record type dos analgesic give post operatively , well post operative pain assessment ( NAS VAS ) . In addition parameter , long term follow conduct determine long term effect intervention cancer recurrence . Peri-operative administration COX inhibitor beta- adrenergic blocker Routine pre medication surgery generally include anxiolytic benzodiazepine , drug routinely take patient , additional drug specific indication . Preventive administration beta- blocker COX inhibitor recommend literature pertain anesthesia pain . Administration beta- blocker show stabilize cardio vascular system decrease peri-operative ischemic event ( 23 ) , preventive administration COX inhibitor decrease post operative pain ( 5 ) . Post operative pain significant immunological effect : cause secretion endogenous opiate , often treat synthetic opiate morphine . The opiate cause stress response , suppress immune function promote tumor growth spread . Studies show administration COX inhibitor together morphine cause decrease morphine requirement . Administration COX inhibitor help control pain abrogation prostaglandin mediate pain pathway time decrease opiate requirement . An additional benefit COX inhibitor 's direct activity tumor cell enhance apoptosis decrease tumor blood supply report recently publish study ( 21 ) . These study indicate peri-operative use drug detrimental effect , associate increase complication - fact may beneficial .
