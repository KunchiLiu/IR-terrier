	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Two Medications Treat Hepatitis C People With Thalassemia ( The HepC Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C inflammation liver cause infection hepatitis C virus . Over time , people may develop liver failure , liver cancer , cirrhosis , condition liver may become permanently scar . Ribavirin peginterferon alfa-2a two medication use treat hepatitis C. Ribavirin stop hepatitis C virus spread inside body , peginterferon alfa-2a decrease amount hepatitis C virus body . Individuals thalassemia , inherit blood disorder cause anemia , often receive regular blood transfusion part treatment . These individual may increase risk develop hepatitis C result blood transfusion receive routine hepatitis C blood screen available . Treating thalassemia patient standard hepatitis C therapy difficult ribavirin worsen anemia . However , omit ribavirin increase risk hepatitis C relapse follow treatment . The purpose study evaluate safety ribavirin peginterferon alfa-2a treat hepatitis C adult thalassemia . This study enroll adult thalassemia long-term hepatitis C. Participants attend study visit weekly 4 week , every 2 week Week 24 , every 4 week Week 48 , every 6 week Week 72 . All participant receive peginterferon alfa-2a injection week ribavirin daily . Participants hepatitis C genotype 1 receive 48 week treatment ; participant genotypes disease receive 24 week treatment . A liver biopsy occur baseline Week 48 . The following occur select study visit : physical exam , blood urine collection , hear vision screening , chest x-ray , heart rate monitoring , questionnaires assess hepatitis C symptom , quality life , depression . Participants liver iron level great 20 mg/g undergo echocardiogram ultrasound test every 3 month monitor heart .</detailed_description>
