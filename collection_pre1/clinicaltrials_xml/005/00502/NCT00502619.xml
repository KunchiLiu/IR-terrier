To test novel approach , subject undergo 16 week treatment , consist acupuncture 4 week follow overlap period 12 week acupuncture plus low intensity treadmill walk exercise . Preliminary data collect assess improvement , , : ) self-report function , b ) pain control , c ) ambulatory activity , ) exercise capacity . Additionally , study determine viability combine treatment paradigm large study examine efficacy . Major objective determine rate compliance participation therapy acupuncture plus low-intensity treadmill walk program , completion rate treatment session associate health assessment form , well challenge recruitment . In addition , preliminary data support application large pilot study obtain . The investigator ' long-term research goal study novel paradigm ability reduce chronic low back pain . The specific aim study follow : Specific Objective 1 . To determine whether individual CLBP receive acupuncture plus treadmill exercise exhibit superior improvement function measure Oswestry Disability Index II . Specific Objective 2 . To determine whether CLBP patient receive acupuncture plus treadmill exercise exhibit reduce pain score measure Numeric Pain Intensity Rating Scale . Specific Objective 3 . To determine whether CLBP patient receive acupuncture plus treadmill exercise improve home community base ambulatory activity level quantify Step Activity Monitors ( SAM ) . Specific Objective 4 . CLBP patient receive acupuncture plus exercise great gain cardiovascular fitness level measure exercise test open circuit spirometry ( V02 Max ) .</detailed_description>
