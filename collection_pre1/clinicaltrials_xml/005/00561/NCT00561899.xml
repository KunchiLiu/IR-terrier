	<brief_summary>Intermittent preventive treatment ( IPT ) offer way prevent malaria infection without compromise development malaria immunity encourage drug resistance . The effect IPT child prevention malaria evaluate number trial area seasonal malaria transmission . Results trial show IPTc provide 40 % - 86 % protection clinical malaria . In 2006 , trial compare two method IPTc delivery carry Upper River Division , The Gambia . Preliminary result trial show treatment effective 4 % ( 45/1133 ) child see end year cross-sectional survey parasitaemic . Tolerability assess subset 1100 child result show 13.5 % child develop mild moderate vomiting . Malaise present 10 % study subject . Severe adverse event rare . Thus important investigate drug regimen might equally effective prevent malaria less likely cause adverse event . During 2007 malaria transmission season , 1009 child age 1-5 year individually randomize receive amodiaquine plus SP , piperaquine plus SP Artekin TM ( dihdroartemisinin plus piperaquine ) monthly interval three occasion month September , October , November . To determine prevalence side effect follow drug administration participant treatment group visit home three seven day round drug administration side effect questionnaire complete . To help establish whether adverse event drug relate , questionnaire administer treatment round , 286 age-matched child part trial . The primary end point incidence adverse event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives Primary Objective To determine safety tolerability amodiaquine ( AQ ) ( three day ) plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) ( one day ) , piperaquine ( PQP ) ( three day ) plus SP ( one day ) , Artekin TM ( PQP plus dihydroartemisinin , DHA ) ( 3 day ) use seasonal IPT child . Secondary Objective To determine efficacy AQ ( three day ) plus SP ( one day ) , PQP ( three day ) plus SP ( one day ) Artekin TM ( 3 day ) use seasonal IPT child . 3.4 Randomisation Open-label , individual randomisation carry three week first dose IPTc administration September 2007 . Study subject individually randomise either AQ plus SP , PQP plus SP ArtekinTM treatment group 1:1:1 fashion . An independent statistician generate randomize subject study number ( SSN ) assign SSN one treatment group . A photo ID card give participant facilitate identification every contact , home health centre . 3.5 Drug distribution health centre Study subject parent informed date treatment approximately one week intervention . Treatment schedule give month September , October November . Drugs give near health centre designate member staff . Tablets crush , mixed honey suspended water give spoon . Staff administer drug health centre play part trial . All participant keep observation 30 minute drug take . In case vomiting , drug re-administrated . At time monthly drug administration , brief clinical assessment carry . Children febrile screen malaria use rapid antigen test . Children find malaria treat Lumefantrine-artemether ( CoartemTM , Norvatis Pharma. , Basel Switzerland ) . 3.7 Morbidity surveillance rainy season Passive surveillance malaria maintain throughout transmission season . Parents/guardians encourage take child health centre identify close home time child becomes unwell . Project staff base health facility identify child trial ensure see , properly investigate treat promptly . At clinic visit , axillary temperature record use digital thermometer haemoglobin concentration measure use Hemocue machine . A dipstick diagnosis malaria use fever ( axillary temperature ³ 37.5°C ) history fever within previous 48 hour present . In case , thick blood smear also collect subsequent confirmation diagnosis . Study subject document fever ( axillary temperature ³ 37.5°C ) history recent fever malaria parasitaemia treated Coartem . The treatment study subject see health centre condition carry accordance national guideline . 3.8 End malaria transmission season cross-sectional survey Children enrol study see OPD clinic end malaria transmission season examination study physician finger-prick blood sample obtain preparation thick blood smear determination haemoglobin concentration . A standardized questionnaire administer parents/guardians study subject , collect information regard illness occur since last visit , symptom experience , use healthcare facility use medicine . Information use bed net collect visit . 3.10 . Assessment adverse event To determine prevalence minor side effect follow drug administration headache , fever , weakness , abdominal pain , anorexia , nausea , vomit , diarrhoea , rash , itch sleep disorder participant treatment group visit home three seven day round drug administration side effect questionnaire complete . Field worker complete questionnaire unaware treatment group child belongs . To help establish whether adverse event drug relate , questionnaire administer treatment round , 286 child part trial , recruit nearby village match age child trial . Any serious adverse event occur study period report Local Safety Monitor Chairman DSMB . Primary end-point : - Incidence adverse event observation period . Secondary endpoint : - Mean Hb ( g/dl ) end malaria transmission . - Prevalence malaria parasitaemia end malaria transmission season . - Number OPD attendances malaria meet case definition indicate surveillance period . Data management analysis All baseline , surveillance laboratory data collect form design trial . Field laboratory staff train follow procedure set series Standard Operating Procedures ( SOPs ) . Key data double enter inconsistency check ; range check use standard variable . Primary analysis perform intention treat ( ITT ) basis . Any child receives first dose drug include ITT analysis . Children randomise receive mediation include analysis . Sample size calculation Drugs IPT need acceptable low frequency adverse event . If frequency adverse event 20 % SP/AQ group , trial 286 child per arm 90 % power detect halve frequency adverse event , use significance level 0.05 , reduction 9 % less significance 0.025 use ( preserve overall type 1 error rate 5 % primary endpoint 2 comparison , alternative drug group SP/AQ ) . If frequency adverse event 15 % , reduction 5 % le detected power , frequency 10 % reduction 2 % less detect . Based experience several study drop-out rate expect exceed 15 % likely less . Allowing 15 % drop , sample size 286*3/ ( 1-0.15 ) =1009 need . Withdrawal study : Study subject may withdraw study one follow reason . 1 . Withdrawal parental / legal guardian 's consent . 2 . Serious adverse event attributable study drug . 3 . Loss follow-up . Children develop adverse event attributable study drug receive dos followed-up monitor safety resolution adverse reaction .</detailed_description>
