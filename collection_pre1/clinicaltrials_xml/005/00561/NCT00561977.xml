	<detailed_description>Summary Grant : Several study demonstrate poor dietary quality associate obesity certain cancer , gastrointestinal , colorectal , hormonal cancer . Dietary intervention aim improve diet plague poor adherence , possibly due complexity change multiple diet component . Complex public health message associate bad adherence reduce capacity impact health outcome . If simple public health recommendation diet effective change multiple aspect diet , adherence impact could maximize . However , research yet test single dietary message great impact overall diet quality , consequently , potential cancer heart disease prevention . Thus far , dietary intervention test vary combination multiple recommendation ; however , single dietary recommendation may synergistic beneficial effect area diet , preclude need make message overly complex . The present study compare 3 dietary change condition hypothesize high potential synergistic effect unaddressed area diet , consequently overall dietary quality . Patients randomize one three arm : 1. low saturate fat diet ( ≤7 % total calorie ) ; 2. high fiber diet ( ≥30 gram total fiber per day ) ; 3. combination arm : low saturate fat high fiber . Each participant instruct reduce calorie -500 kcal/day his/her rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) , total calorie less 1200 calorie per day . Additionally , Dr. Ira Ockene , professor medicine , director preventive cardiology program , generously offer pay blood draw blood lipid glucose analysis visit make study valuable cancer heart disease research perspectives . Specific aim : 1 . Develop intervention material . Intervention material specifically aid participant towards low saturate fat high fiber diet , combination change develop condition . 2 . Preliminary test intervention . We calculate change diet quality , lipid , body weight , waist circumference , blood pressure 3- 6-months . We hypothesize single change condition produce change complex condition add beneficial high fiber food diet result improve dietary quality ( measure Alternative Healthy Eating Index ) reduce saturate fat . Secondary outcome include calorie intake , micro- macronutrients baseline , physical activity , observe change 3- 6-months . 3 . Adherence . We examine adherence treatment protocol appropriate adjustment intervention make , necessary , enhance adherence large randomized clinical trial . 4 . Data sample size estimation . We document mean standard deviation measure sample size estimate large randomized clinical trial .</detailed_description>
