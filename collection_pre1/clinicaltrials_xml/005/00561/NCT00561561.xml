	<brief_summary>This study look problem people sometimes take information sens . Specifically , compare way people diagnose schizophrenia process sound information , compare people never diagnose psychiatric disorder . When people hear loud sound sometimes feel startled , feel startle usually blink eye . However , hear soft sound shortly loud one may blink eye - word , eye-blink response small . When happen 's call prepulse inhibition startle . In study , want measure startle response prepulse inhibition startle individual diagnose schizophrenia versus individual diagnose schizophrenia . We also want find whether people show amount prepulse inhibition startle member family .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sensorimotor Gating Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients schizophrenia difficulty screen irrelevant stimulus , often experience sensory flooding . These `` gating deficit '' may contribute thought disorder , cognitive fragmentation hallucination debilitate individual . The acoustic startle response reflex contraction skeletal muscle response sudden acoustic stimulus . It occur across mammalian specie easily measure . The modulation reflex preliminary nonstartling stimulus term prepulse inhibition acoustic startle ( PPI ) , paradigm use operational measure sensorimotor gating . In consonance schizophrenia symptom suggestive gate deficit , many patient schizophrenia deficit PPI compare healthy control . The brain region modulate PPI include hippocampus prefrontal cortex , area implicate abnormal schizophrenia . Our prior work work labs suggest PPI impairment schizophrenia improve treatment hence may trait related abnormality . Work current funding period support original hypothesis , namely impaired PPI exhibit familial association . Specifically , find PPI first degree family member subject schizophrenia impair . Further work need order establish PPI impairment heritable . An endophenotype measurable trait phenotype detectable biological test . Using endophenotype rather presence absence disease powerful tool study diseases complex polygenic etiology schizophrenia . Progress genetics schizophrenia greatly confound difficulty identify individual carry gene contribute schizophrenia . Incomplete penetrance fact heritable environmental factor interact produce disease add difficulty . This mean individual carry vulnerability gene schizophrenia fail exhibit robust symptom classify erroneously unaffected genetic study , confound attempt reliably define heritable phenotype . The phenomenon incomplete penetrance exhibit find risk schizophrenia child affect nonaffected monozygotic twin . The polygenic etiology schizophrenia make unlikely pooled sample individual define presence schizophrenia greatly overlap vulnerability gene carry . The goal endophenotype approach narrow define phenotype homogeneous genotype expect , make much fruitful conduct genetic study . We hypothesize impaired PPI prove heritable endophenotype schizophrenia . Based work accomplish current funding period , propose develop line research conduct heritability analysis PPI . Our field greatly need work prelude endophenotype-based genetic study . We accomplish important goal collect characterize cohort healthy control family , expand sample schizophrenia subject family . We collect diagnostic , symptom , cognitive , pedigree , PPI data subject , collect blood extract DNA future genetic analysis . We use family base strategy investigate pattern degree heritability impair PPI family schizophrenia control probands . This project provide necessary next step advance use impaired PPI powerful tool discovery vulnerability gene contribute schizophrenia . Currently available treatment devastate disorder sadly inadequate . Our medication virtually ineffective subset patient . The discovery vulnerability gene method biological subtyping patient allow field develop genetically inform new treatment specifically target particular subtypes patient . This approach best hope bring relief patient suffer disease .</detailed_description>
