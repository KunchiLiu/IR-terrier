	<brief_summary>Arimoclomol small molecule upregulates `` molecular chaperone '' cell stress . Arimoclomol extend survival five week give pre-symptomatically disease onset mutant superoxide dismutase ( SOD1 ) transgenic mouse model ALS . Furthermore , demonstrate neuroprotective neuroregenerative effect rat model nerve damage . Molecular chaperone proteins critical cellular response stress protein misfolding . Recent data suggest SOD1 mutation responsible ALS patient familial disease reduces availability variety molecular chaperone , thus weaken ability respond cellular stress . Protein misfolding consequent aggregation may play role pathogenesis familial sporadic form ALS . Therapeutic agent arimoclomol improve cellular chaperone response protein misfolding may helpful ALS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicenter , Double-Blind Study Investigate Safety Efficacy Arimoclomol Volunteers With ALS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2b double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled parallel-group study evaluate safety efficacy arimoclomol ( 400 mg t.i.d . ) compare placebo . A safety lead-in phase employ ensure safety study volunteer . Tier I ( Safety Lead-in ) : During enrollment period safety lead-in phase , 24 volunteer meet inclusion/exclusion criterion randomize 4 investigative site . These volunteer weekly visit first 4 week start treatment . Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) perform various timepoints throughout 4 week . After initial 4 week treatment , visit continue 4-week interval Week 36 , subsequently visit occur every 8 week Week 68 . A final visit occur Week 72 . There 28-day post study medication Follow-Up Telephone Call assess medical status adverse event . Tier II : After Tier I volunteer finish 4 week treatment , data review IDMC , serious safety issue identify , recommendation make start second enrollment period ( Tier II ) . During Tier II enrollment , volunteer recruit approximately 30 40 center US Canada randomize . After screen randomization , volunteer follow every 4 week 9 month . Subsequently visit occur every 8 week Week 68 , interim Follow-Up Telephone Calls Weeks 16 , 24 , 32 final visit Week 72 . A Week 76 Follow-Up Telephone Call assess medical status adverse event occur 28 day post last dose study medication .</detailed_description>
