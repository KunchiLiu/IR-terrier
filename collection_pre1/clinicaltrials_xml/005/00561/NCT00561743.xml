	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether doxorubicin HCL liposome injection , bortezomib , Dexamethasone combination , effective previously untreated multiple myeloma patient . Bortezomib inhibit function proteasomes , novel mechanism action .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Assessing Safety Effectiveness BORTEZOMIB Combination Therapy ( Bortezomib + Doxorubicin Hydrochloride + Dexamethasone ) Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm , open-label , Phase II multi-centre study Canada . A total 50 newly diagnose multiple myeloma patient eligible stem cell transplant target recruitment study . Combination doxorubicin HCL liposome injection , bortezomib dexamethasone induction therapy give 4 cycle preparation stem cell collection transplant . As remission status induction prior first second auto-transplant show major determinant event free overall survival multiple myeloma patient , goal improve response rate use various combinational approach . As , objective present study test hypothesis treatment regimen could result high complete + near complete response rate ( CR + nCR ) prior stem cell transplant , obtain current regimen , confirm response rate post-transplant . Safety evaluate use adverse event reporting , clinical laboratory test test cardiac function ( multiple-gated acquisition scan/echocardiogram electrocardiogram ) . Four 21-day cycle combination induction therapy consist 1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib ( give i.v . Days 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 ) + 30 mg/m2 Doxil/Caelyx ( give i.v . Day 4 ) + 40 mg Dex ( give po Days 1-4 , 8-11 , 15-18 Cycle 1 ; Days 1-4 Cycles 2-4 ) .</detailed_description>
