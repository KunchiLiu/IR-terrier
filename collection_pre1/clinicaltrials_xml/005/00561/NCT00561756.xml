	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make mouse DNA may help body build effective immune response kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose mouse DNA vaccine treat patient recurrent B-cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate safety feasibility intramuscular DNA vaccination plasmid DNA vector express mouse extracellular domain CD20 , namely pINGmminiCD20 . Doses pING-mminiCD20 escalated group determine optimal biological dose . Secondary - To evaluate antibody T-cell responses CD20 vaccination . - To observe patient evidence antitumor response generate vaccination . OUTLINE : The entire immunization schedule comprise five injection administer every three week ( total approximately four one half month ) . After second injection , blood drawn assessment antibody T-cell response . After fifth final injection , blood drawn assessment antibody T-cell response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must functional immune system determine follow test : Serum proteins immunoelectrophoresis ( serum IgG level ≥ 0.5 g/dL require ) No evidence anergy show positive skin test tetanus toxoid , mumps Candida . OR Circulating Tcells measure flow cytometry ( serum CD4+ CD8+ Tcell count ≥ 250 150 cells/μL , respectively ) Patients must histologically prove ( confirm MSKCC ) Bcell lymphoma histology , exclude Burkitt 's lymphoma , Lymphoblastic lymphoma ( due aggressiveness low likelihood response immune therapy ) . CD20 surface expression must confirm immunohistochemical staining flow . Measurable disease prerequisite enrollment study . However , patient measurable disease evidence image study , do within eight week start treatment . Patients must Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 % . Patients evidence active disease , progression disease relapse disease follow one prior regimens chemotherapy , immunotherapy radiation therapy ( include autologous stem cell transplant ) , require immediate cytoreductive chemotherapy . All treatment must complete least four week prior administration first vaccination , except immunotherapy radioimmunotherapy , must complete least 90 day prior receive first vaccination . Active disease include patient minor partial response therapy evidence FDGavid disease biopsy . Age ≥ 18 . Adequate contraception study enrollment . Avoidance breastfeed infant study enrollment . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define : Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1,000/uL Platelets ≥ 75,000/uL Total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 time institutional upper limit AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 time institutional upper limit Creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dL PT/PTT ≤ 1.5 time institutional upper limit Patients must sign congestive heart failure accord New York Heart Failure Guidelines Class III/IV . Patients chemotherapy radiation therapy within 4 week prior enter study . Patients undergone allogeneic stem cell transplant time . Patients recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients receive immunotherapy ( i.e . rituximab ) radioimmuno therapy ( i.e . tositumomab ibritumomab ) within past 90 day . Patients display sign anergy indicate skin testing . Patients Burkitt 's lymphoma Lymphoblastic Lymphoma . Patients previously immunize type DNA vaccine . Patients positive antiDSDNA antibody . Patients life expectancy le 3 month time enrollment . Patients serious underlying medical condition , active infection require use antimicrobial drug active bleeding . Patients active Hepatitis C ( HC ) Hepatitis B ( HB ) infection , latter define positive test HBsAg measurable viral load . In patient HBsAg negative HBsAg positive ( regardless HBsAb status ) , HB viral load perform positive subject exclude . If subject HBsAg negative , HBcAb positive ( regardless HBsAb status ) negative HBV viral load , subject may include must undergo HBV DNA PCR test least every two month start treatment routine study visit long subject remain study . Prophylactic antiviral therapy , addition monitoring describe , may initiate discretion investigator . Patients document HIV infection immunodeficiency disorder chronic steroid treatment . Patients autoimmune disease limit rheumatoid arthritis , Sjogren disease , ulcerative colitis , autoimmune hepatitis . Pregnant nursing woman . Women childbearing age test qualitative βHCG within 2 week immunization . Patients receive investigational drug .</criteria>
