	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate efficient TMC435350 work Hepatitis C virus genotype 1 ( genotype refer genetic constitution virus ) concentration TMC435350 blood without pegylated interferon alpha-2a ( PegIFNa-2a ) PegIFNa-2a plus ribavirin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study TMC435350 Administered With Without Standard Care Therapy Participants With Genotype 1 Hepatitis C Virus Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This blind ( participant study staff know identity assign treatment ) , randomize ( participant assign treatment chance ) , placebo-controlled ( term use describe method research inactive substance refer placebo give one group participant , treatment test give another group ) study assess effectiveness , safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( test concentration study drug blood time ) different dose regimen TMC435350 ( hereafter refer TMC435 ) give alone combination peginterferon alpha-2a ( PegIFNa-2a ) ribavirin . TMC435 new drug development treatment Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection belongs class drug work block enzyme ( protease ) HCV need replicate . The combination PegIFNa-2a ribavirin current standard care ( SoC ) therapy patient chronic HCV infection . Approximately 72 participant HCV infection never treat HCV infection ( refer treatment-naïve participant ) 36 participant treat HCV infection ( refer treatment-experienced participant ) respond previous therapy interferon ( IFN ) discontinue previous anti-HCV therapy adverse event [ AEs ] ) include study . Two blind placebo-controlled group ( refer `` cohort '' ) treatment-naïve participant sequentially initiate TMC435 ensure high dose administer previous low dose find safe tolerable . The first group ( Cohort 1 ) treatment-naïve participant receive low-doses TMC435 placebo 7 day follow 21 day combine tritherapy PegIFNa-2a ribavirin OR participant receive 28 day tritherapy ( TMC435 placebo + PegIFNa-2a ribavirin ) . After review data Cohort 1 , second group ( Cohort 2 ) treatment-naïve participant give high dos TMC435 placebo manner describe first cohort . A third group ( Cohort 3 ) participant previously plan study enrol . After review data Cohort 2 , fourth group ( Cohort 4 ) treatment-experienced participant give 28 day TMC435 ( placebo ) tritherapy PegIFNa-2a ribavirin determine maximum tolerate dose TMC435 . In addition , 10 HCV-infected individual ( participate study TMC435350-TiDP16-C101 ( ClinicalTrials.gov registry number NCT00938899 ) comprise Cohort 5 give 28 day TMC435 dose previously determine safe efficacious tritherapy PegIFNa-2a ribavirin . Blood sample take participant protocol-specified time point determine plasma concentration TMC435 ribavirin safety monitor throughout study . Individuals participate study 54 week ( include 6 week screen period follow 4 week study treatment TMC435 ( placebo ) maximum 44 week treatment PegIFNa-2a ribavirin .</detailed_description>
