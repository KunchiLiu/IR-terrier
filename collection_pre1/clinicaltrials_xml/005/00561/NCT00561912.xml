	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) time patient advanced renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) treat decitabine interferon alfa-2b . Secondary Objectives : - To determine toxicity combination decitabine interferon alfa-2b propose dose schedule patient advance RCC - To determine overall response Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion patient advance RCC treat decitabine interferon alfa-2b . - To determine overall survival time patient advance RCC treat decitabine interferon . - To study effect decitabine interferon alfa-2b DNA methylation gene expression patient ' tumor non-tumor tissue correlation clinical outcome . - To characterize modulation cellular immunity induce combination decitabine interferon alfa-2b patient advance RCC correlate result clinical outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Dose Decitabine + Interferon Alfa-2b Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>THE STUDY DRUGS : Decitabine design slow tumor growth may cause death cancer cell . Interferon alfa-2B design activate immune system , may help keep tumor grow , may shrink tumor . STUDY TREATMENT : If find eligible take part study , receive decitabine vein 1 hour Days 1-5 cycle . A cycle study 28 day long . All treatment decitabine take place M. D. Anderson . Once complete 2 cycle decitabine ( Day 1 Cycle 3 ) , begin take interferon alfa-2b twice day ( morning afternoon ) continue 5-day dosing schedule decitabine . Interferon alfa-2b give subcutaneous ( skin ) injection . It give caregiver home local doctor . You caregiver taught injection . STUDY VISITS : You follow tests/procedures perform clinic visit . On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask medication treatment may currently receive . - You performance status evaluation . - You ask side effect may experience since last visit . You blood draw ( 1 teaspoon ) routine test . Beginning Cycle 3 , require return clinic around Day 14 cycle follow test : - You blood draw ( 1 teaspoon time ) week routine test . If experience severe side effect Cycles 3 4 , long required weekly routine blood test . Instead , return routine blood drawn Day 1 cycle . This once-weekly schedule restart experience severe side effect Cycle 5 . - You CT MRI scan check status disease . - Your vital sign measure - You ask side effect may experience since last visit . LENGTH OF STUDY : You continue take study drug combination unless disease get bad , develop illness allow continue receive study therapy , experience intolerable side effect . If thing occur , remove study . This investigational study . Decitabine FDA approve commercially available treatment myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . Interferon alfa-2b FDA approve commercially available treatment several type cancer , malignant melanoma , hairy cell leukemia , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Their use together study treatment PRC investigational authorize use research . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm clear cell renal carcinoma metastatic unresectable . In absence metastatic disease , patient deem unresectable inoperable document surgical opinion confirm . Surgical opinion render either surgical consultation presentation interdisciplinary conference . Patients locally recurrent RCC eligible , surgical resection local recurrence feasible refuse patient . Patients locally advance unresectable RCC measurable evaluable metastatic disease eligible protocol . Patients bilateral renal cancer eligible long cancer clear cell type patient metastatic unresectable disease . Patients may receive two prior anticancer therapy ( include receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor cytokine therapy ) prior chemotherapy renal cell carcinoma . Patients receive prior standard therapy , otherwise deem ineligible therapy . Patients must measurable clinically evaluable disease define RECIST criterion . Patients must &gt; /= 14 day beyond last administration anticancer therapy , must recover toxicity prior therapy . Patients must &gt; /= 18 year age . ECOG performance status &lt; /= 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; /= 60 % ) . Patients must adequate organ marrow function , measure within 14 day study entry , define : All Patients : Absolute neutrophil count &gt; /= 1,500/microL ; Platelets &gt; /= 100,000/microL ; Creatinine ( serum ) &lt; /= 2.0 mg/dL Patients without liver metastasis : Total bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5 mg/dL ; AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; /= 2.5 X Institutional Upper Limit Normal ( IULN ) Patients liver metastasis : Total bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5 x IULN ; AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; /= 5 x IULN The effect decitabine interferon develop human fetus unknown . For reason chemotherapy agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Female patient childbearing potential normal plasma beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( betaHCG ) . Patients must give write informed consent prior initiation therapy keep policy institution . Patients history major psychiatric illness must judge able fully understand investigational nature study risk associate therapy . Patients active autoimmune disorder receive immunosuppressive therapy ( include steroid methotrexate ) indication . Patients may receive investigational agent within two week study entry . Patients may receive investigational agent study . Patients major surgery within 2 week prior enter study , otherwise adequately recover prior surgery . Patients palliative radiation therapy within 1 week prior enter study . Patients untreated symptomatic brain metastasis . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , potentially lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmia . Psychiatric illness social situation opinion investigator could interfere completion propose treatment . Pregnant woman exclude study decitabine antimetabolite potential teratogenic abortifacient effect interferon alfa2b abortifacient activity animal study . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother decitabine , breastfeed discontinue mother treated decitabine decitabine interferon . Because patient immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy , patient know HIVpositive receive antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction study agent .</criteria>
