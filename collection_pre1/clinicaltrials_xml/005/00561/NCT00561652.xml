	<detailed_description>Chronic low back pain ( LBP ) associate poor health , low quality life , high cost , highly prevalent veteran . Both chiropractic care exercise modestly reduce pain and/or improve function randomize control trial ( RCTs ) patient chronic LBP . However , effect may apply similarly population . For example , RCT data chiropractic care older ( age &gt; 70 ) patient chronic LBP , though increase spinal arthritis , comorbidities frailty , patient may require modified chiropractic technique likely differ response chiropractic treatment . While recent systematic review RCTs predict home exercise program individualize , high-dose , therapist-directed , incorporated stretch strengthen would meaningful treatment chronic LBP , also could provide robust comparison group chronic LBP treatment . The combination regimen chiropractic care predict additive benefit chronic LBP premise n't directly test . To aim improve health chronic LBP patient , plan RCT veterans chronic LBP , compare effectiveness , cost-effectiveness cost-utility tailor education/exercise ( E/E ) intervention alone vs. E/E plus chiropractic care . The demographic medical complexity veteran population provide great opportunity test appropriate role chiropractic care patient chronic LBP advance chronic LBP research clinicalcare . Subjects recruit primarily patient attend Minneapolis VAMC clinic complaint chronic LBP . Thirty eligible veteran randomize E/E alone vs. E/E plus chiropractic care . All participant receive E/E instruction four 1-hr individual session 8 week , include individually design , high dose , therapist-directed home exercise program . Chiropractic care deliver chiropractor follow standard protocol , 12 session 12 week .

Each `` time attention '' session involve 5 minute exam , 5 minute hot pack application low back , 5 minute light massage low back . During visit , participant receive SMT , mobilization active chiropractic treatment . The recruitment goal generate potential randomize 6-10 participants/month . Recruitment feasibility assess track number patient make initial inquiry , undergo screen in-clinic evaluation , randomize . Further , reason nonparticipation disqualification examine describe . Participant adherence intervention define complete &gt; 3 4 education session , &gt; 20 hr home exercise , &gt; 80 % recommend chiropractic visit nonchiropractic follow-up exam/interviews . Adherence clinic visit assess provider treatment log . Home exercise compliance track questionnaire . Participant adherence data collection define &gt; 90 % follow-up rate time point assess track questionnaire completion rate . Descriptive data distribution primary main secondary efficacy outcome measure use calculate sample size generate power table full-scale trial .</detailed_description>
