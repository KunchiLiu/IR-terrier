	<detailed_description>The primary goal therapy patient metastatic breast cancer palliation prolongation life quality , many patient metastatic breast cancer ultimately die disease . Although randomized trial compare chemotherapy supportive care woman metastatic breast cancer , chemotherapy clearly provide survival benefit early breast cancer produce tumor shrinkage metastatic disease . Institutional database show improvement survival patient metastatic disease past two decade , may due diagnosis earlier phase metastatic disease effective therapy . The median survival patient treat modern taxane-based chemotherapy reach approximately 2 year . The duration chemotherapy patient respond stable disease remain controversial , since quality life usually adversely affected may even improve many patient receive cytotoxic chemotherapy . In addition , many commonly use chemotherapeutic agent limited cumulative toxicity metastatic breast cancer patient . Several trial report continuous therapy generally prolong duration remission , effect survival quality life less consistent . Coates et al compare continuous therapy AC CMF intermittent therapy use 3 cycle regimen reinstitution therapy time disease progression . Patients receive continuous therapy superior response rate , time progression , good quality life , improvement overall survival trial . A similar trial Peidmont Oncology Association randomly assign patient respond stable disease six cycle CAF either CMF observation , follow reinstitution CMF disease progression . Although time progression twice long patient continuous therapy interrupt treatment , overall survival similar . Falkson et al randomly assign 141 patient whose measurable disease show complete response 6 cycle CAF receive either chemohormonal therapy observation find difference overall survival despite prolongation time progression treatment arm . In summary , data suggest maintenance chemotherapy associate superior time progression survival gain . However , randomized trial incorporate taxane-based chemotherapeutic regimen , new standard care metastatic breast cancer patient day . In 10 year since initial license Europe , taxanes , paclitaxel docetaxel , emerge critical drug treatment metastatic breast cancer patient . In TAX 303 trial , patient prior alkylating agent exposure randomly assign receive either docetaxel , 100 mg/m2 , doxorubicin , 75 mg/m2 , every 3 week . Docetaxel produce superior response rate ( 48 % versus 33 % , P=.008 ) time treatment failure . In addition , docetaxel le marrow suppressive , statistically significantly low rate thrombocytopenia , anemia , transfusion blood platelet , neutropenic fever . Paclitaxel compare doxorubicin two randomized trial . In European Organization Research Treatment Cancer study , paclitaxel ( 200mg/m2 administer 3-hour infusion ) inferior doxorubicin . In Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) trial , 24-hour paclitaxel doxorubicin produce equivalent result . Paclitaxel also show equivalent CMFP ( cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , fluorouracil , prednisone ) chemotherapy first-line chemotherapy metastatic breast cancer patient . The survival advantage combination chemotherapy firmly establish breast cancer patient yet . No trial show convincing survival advantage combination therapy single agent give sequence . However , publish trial criticize underpowered unable demonstrate survival difference high 20 % . A 1998 metaanalysis 1,986 patient randomly assign combination chemotherapy single-agent therapy metastatic breast cancer patient demonstrate survival advantage combination chemotherapy , hazard ratio 0.82 ( range , 0.75 0.90 ) . Two recently publish study , capecitabine docetaxel versus docetaxel alone paclitaxel gemcitabine versus paclitaxel alone , show significant survival advantage combination chemotherapy . In capecitabine/docetaxel study , 511 patient measurable metastatic breast cancer receive prior anthracycline randomly assign receive either docetaxel oral capecitabine docetaxel alone [ 16 ] . The combination docetaxel capecitabine demonstrate high response rate ( 42 % vs 30 % , P=.006 ) , long time progression ( 6.1 vs 4.2 month , P=.0001 ) , long overall survival ( 14.5 vs 11.5 month , P=.0126 ) . The gemcitabine/paclitaxel study randomize 529 woman chemo-naïve , measurable metastatic breast cancer receive either paclitaxel ( 175 mg/m2 3 hour every 3 week ) gemcitabine ( 1,250 mg/m2 30 minute , day 1 8 every 3 week ) , paclitaxel ( 175 mg/m2 3 hour every 3 week ) alone . The combination arm show high response rate ( 41 % vs 22 % , P &lt; .0001 ) , long time progression ( 5.2 vs 2.9 month , P &lt; .0001 ) , long survival ( 18.5 vs 15.8 month , P=.018 ) . At ASCO meeting 2005 , Chan colleague report result European phase III study compare gemcitabine/docetaxel versus capecitabine/docetaxel anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast cancer patient . 305 patient randomized receive gemcitabine/docetaxel capecitabine/docetaxel significant difference response rate , PFS , survival two arm . However , gemcitabine/docetaxel good risk-benefit profile term less drug-related discontinuation , less gastrointestinal toxicity , less skin toxicity . Although several randomized trial show negative result survival gain patient receive maintenance chemotherapy , role maintenance chemotherapy newer agent , docetaxel paclitaxel , establish yet . The Italian MANTA trial register 451 metastatic breast cancer patient receive induction chemotherapy epirubicin doxorubicin/paclitaxel randomize 253 responder ( CR , PR , SD ) receive maintenance therapy paclitaxel observation . Although trial demonstrate difference PFS survival two arm , metaanalysis advocate survival benefit maintenance therapy . Since gemcitabine/paclitaxel ( GP ) combination chemotherapy one two regimen show definite survival gain randomize trial , plan randomize patient respond six cycle GP induction chemotherapy receive additional maintenance GP chemotherapy disease progression versus observation . We hypothesize patient receive maintenance GT chemotherapy well term progression free survival .</detailed_description>
