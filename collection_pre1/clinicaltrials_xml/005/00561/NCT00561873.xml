	<detailed_description>High grade malignant glioma tumor grade III IV accord WHO classification , originate oligodendroglia astrocyte , latter also know anaplastic astrocytoma ( WHO grade III ) glioblastoma ( WHO grade IV ) . This also include intrinsic pontine glioma adolescent , usually document histologically due localisation , similar clinical progress compare high grade malignant astrocytic tumor . Among various molecular alteration , malignant glioma overexpress EGFR ( epidermal growth factor ) nearly 50 % case , particularly pronounced glioblastoma . ( Schlegel 2003 ) Standard therapy consist radical surgery extensive medically responsible follow radiotherapy dose 60 Gy , aim area safety margin . The long-term efficacy additional chemotherapy subject controversy several decade . The combination three treatment modality grade III tumor lead median survival time 3-5 year adult . For treatment group report 5 year recurrence free period 33-50 % case report child adolescent . For glioblastoma ( WHO grade IV ) 5year recurrence free period 3 % elderly patient 10-20 % adolescent . ( Schlegel 2003 ) In German speak territory chemotherapy Cisplatin , Etoposid Ifosfamid use postoperative treatment option adolescent disease . ( Wolff HIT-GBM ) In case recurrence therapy choice even limit , thus medically feasible enrolment clinical trial option . In study aim use antibody direct EGF-receptor effect proliferation tumor cell negatively . Pilot study conduct adult indicate median survival time patient malignant glioma prolong antibody treatment .</detailed_description>
