	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer responsible 227.000 death per year , eighth common cause death cancer sex combine , position relatively high compare incidence ( thirteenth position ) poor prognosis ( M/I ratio 98 % ) ( Global Cancer Statistics , 2002 ) . The incidence pancreatic carcinoma increase almost 300 % since 1950 exceeds incidence stomach cancer cancer rectum . Carcinoma exocrine pancreas nearly always fatal disease . The overall 5-year survival rate disease 4.1 % . Locally advance metastatic pancreatic cancer relatively unresponsive chemotherapy . Gemcitabine therapy provide benefit modestly improve survival compare fluorouracil , median survival patient advanced disease remain less 6 month ( Burris et al , 1997 ) . Cytotoxic drug combination able show survival advantage compare Gemcitabine alone numerous randomized phase III study . Altered expression constitutive activation epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR/HER1/erbB1 ) commonly occur primary metastatic pancreatic cancer often critical factor progressive growth resistance normal mechanism cell death . Epidermal growth factor receptor expression pancreatic cancer correlate tumor aggressiveness . Clinical trial already suggest EGF-R targeted therapy may improve antitumor activity chemotherapy treatment pancreatic carcinoma . Monoclonal antibody specific EGF-R combine safely effectively chemotherapy . Nimotuzumab ( OSAG101 , hR3 , Theraloc ) humanize monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) bind EGFR . In preclinical study antibody show potent antitumor activity . Based phase I data , recommend dose establish 200 mg weekly . A previous phase II study child high grade brain tumor show activity Nimotuzumab monotherapeutic agent , even prognostic unfavourable diffuse , intrinsic pontine glioma . No drug relate side effect report . Nimotuzumab ( OSAG101 , Theraloc ) combination radiotherapy treatment locally advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck result high rate antitumor response , accompany favourable safety profile . Nimotuzumab ( OSAG101 , Theraloc ) high hepatic uptake level . This randomized , placebo-controlled Phase IIb/IIIa study analyze efficacy safety Nimotuzumab combination Gemcitabine treatment chemotherapy-naive patient advance unresectable metastatic pancreatic carcinoma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A patient must meet follow inclusion criterion eligible enrollment study : 1. write informed consent . 2. histologically cytologically confirm locally advanced metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas amenable curative radiotherapy surgery . 3. measurable disease define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion ( ie , target lesion accurately measure least one dimension long diameter ≥ 20 mm use conventional technique ≥ 10 mm use spiral compute tomography [ CT ] scan ) . 4. able take medication orally . 5. least18 year age old . 6 . Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥ 70 % ( see Appendix A ) . 7. life expectancy &gt; 12 week . 8. adequate organ function define follow criterion : Transaminases AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) . If liver function abnormality due underlie liver metastasis , AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) may ≤ 5 time ULN . Total serum bilirubin ≤ 3.0 time ULN ( due underlie liver metastasis , total bilirubin may ≤ 5 time ULN ) . Absolute granulocyte count ≥ 1,500/mm3 ( ie , ≥ 1.5 x 109/L International Units ( IU ] ) . Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 ( IU : ≥ 100 x 109/L ) . Hemoglobin value ≥ 9.0 g/dL . Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min ( base serum creatinine ) ( Cockcroft Gault formula ) . 9. willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . 10. female male patient must use adequate method contraception . 1. treatment follow within specified time frame prior study drug administration : 1 . Any prior anticancer chemotherapy . 2 . Radiation therapy target lesion unless evidence PD radiotherapy ( target lesion must site measurable disease ) . 3 . Any radiotherapy within previous 3 week . 4 . Any investigational agent receive either concurrently within last 30 day . 5 . Current enrollment another clinical trial . 2 . Major surgery within previous 3 week . 3 . Symptomatic brain metastasis control corticosteroid . 4 . Leptomeningeal metastasis . 5 . Previous concurrent malignancy pancreatic cancer except adequately treat carcinoma insitu cervix nonmelanoma skin cancer . 6 . Uncontrolled ascites require drainage least twice week . 7 . Other serious illness medical condition ( ) include , limited , follow : Uncontrolled congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] Class III IV , see Appendix F ) , angina pectoris , arrhythmia , hypertension . active infection . know ( time entry ) gastrointestinal disorder , include malabsorption , chronic nausea , vomit , diarrhea , present extent might interfere oral intake absorption study medication . Poorly control diabetes mellitus . Psychiatric disorder may interfere consent and/or protocol compliance . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) relate illness . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment Investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study . 8. pregnant lactate female . 9. known hypersensitivity AntiEGFR antibody . 10. reproductive potential refuse use adequate mean contraception ( include male patient ) .</criteria>
