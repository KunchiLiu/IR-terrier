	<brief_summary>Elderly patient undergo anesthesia non-cardiac surgery subject deterioration brain function include development postoperative delirium ( PD ) postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) . These disorder cause disability , distress patient family , associate medical complication account significant additional health care cost . We currently use relatively primitive approach prevent treat PD POCD . Dexmedetomidine drug use sedation critically ill patient provide pain relief control body response stress . The sedation produce dexmedetomidine appear similar natural sleep drug use anesthesia postoperative sedation . Data suggest dexmedetomidine prevent delirium follow cardiac surgery develop understanding cause PD POCD suggest dexmedetomidine particularly effective .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Postoperative Delirium PD Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction POCD syndromes central nervous system dysfunction significantly complicate recovery proportion elderly patient follow surgery . Delirium typically transient syndrome characterize de-novo appearance several pathognomonic behavior , include disorientation , decrease attention span , sensory misperceptions , waxing-and-waning type confusion , disorganize thinking . PD typically occur postoperative day 1 3 associate prolonged hospital stay , increase risk morbidity mortality significant health care expenditures . The neuroendocrine stress response surgery , include immediate postoperative period , remain important potential etiologic factor . In particular , data suggest stress immediate postoperative period poorly control anesthetic technique normal diurnal variation cortisol suppress subject develop POCD . Dexmedetomidine highly selective alpha 2A agonist currently approve sedation ICU . Dexmedetomidine produce analgesia , sympatholysis , light sedation characterize easy arousal . Its action converges endogenous substrate natural sleep produce sedative action , effect could prove beneficial elderly postoperative patient . We hypothesize treatment dexmedetomidine diminish PD POCD . The essential proposition modulation perioperative stress ameliorate perioperative delirium cognitive dysfunction . Based concept cognitive reserve well clinical experience , concern patient preoperative cognitive impairment particularly vulnerable POCD . In general , patient exclude previous study . This study unique ass participant mild cognitive impairment prior surgery . Assessment impact preexist cognitive impairment secondary aim . A broad goal interdisciplinary project evaluate POCD , primarily anesthesia concept , general context dementing illness explore geriatric psychiatry .</detailed_description>
