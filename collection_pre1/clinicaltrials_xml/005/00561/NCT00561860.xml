	<brief_summary>Although continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) effective therapy obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea ( OSAH ) , one major impediment use poor compliance . Adherence CPAP range 50 % 75 % , subjective report underestimate actual use . The primary objective determine whether remote monitoring system improve 3 month compliance ( average hour use/night ) , reduce cost care patient OSAH prescribe CPAP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Remote-Monitoring System Diagnose Treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine whether telemedicine monitoring system improve care patient OSAH . This system allow close monitoring patient prescription CPAP , transmit clinically useful physiologic information ( i.e. , residual sleep apnea , mask leak , applied pressure , compliance therapy ) daily patient 's healthcare provider . This allow early detection problem appropriate intervention thereby improve early experience CPAP , reduce number patient discontinue CPAP therapy improve overall compliance . The primary objective determine whether telemedicine system:1 ) improve 3 month compliance ( average hour use/night ) , 2 ) reduces cost care patient moderate severe OSAH prescribe CPAP . Secondary objective determine whether system improve variety outcome include : 1 ) CPAP acceptance ( proportion patient agree use CPAP ) , 2 ) proportion high CPAP user ( &gt; 4 hour average per night ) , 3 ) subjective sleepiness , 4 ) satisfaction CPAP , 5 ) side effect CPAP , 6 ) # change therapy , 7 ) time adequate treatment . In addition , overall satisfaction system also assess . Telemedicine involve provision support direct clinical care via application electronic communicating technology , include remote monitoring health status . By provide patient data early course CPAP prescription , believe technology would immensely useful improve compliance acceptance device patient sleep apnea . We intend perform randomize control trial system versus standard care patient moderate severe OSAH . Patients randomize either 'standard care ' arm 'telemedicine ' arm . To minimize allocation bias , randomization perform use sequential numbered envelope .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients refer sleep study rule sleep apnea Sleep Disorders Program , University British Columbia . All patient document moderate severe OSAH ( AHIâ‰¥15 event per hour PSG ) prescribe CPAP regular sleep physician , willing accept trial CPAP would potentially eligible trial . Patients must also provide telephone number would allow contact regular office hour necessary . Patients must also access telephone line bedroom use transmit data modem . We decide study patient moderate severe disease , patient risk future CV disease motor vehicle crash . As , believe improve CPAP compliance group patient would especially important . Patients exclude participating : Are unable/unwilling provide inform consent Have active cardiopulmonary psychiatric disease Have previously treat OSA , Do reside great Vancouver area .</criteria>
