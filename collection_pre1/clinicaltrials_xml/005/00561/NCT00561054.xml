	<brief_summary>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death worldwide . It estimate , 2004 , 173,700 new case lung cancer diagnose United States alone 164,440 death due disease occur ( 13 ) . NSCLC account approximately 80 % lung cancer . Among NSCLC case approximately 30 % present locally advance 40 % metastatic disease ( 14,15 ) . In metastatic disease , chemotherapy treatment choice , benefit obtain survival modest . Five-year survival le 15 % , probably due diagnosis late stage . Surgical result earlier stage poor compare tumor type ( 40 % recurrence stag I-II ) . Results chemotherapy advance stage also poor ( one-year survival 40 % ) ( 15,17 ) . It commonly accept standard treatment advanced disease ( stage IV IIIb malignant pleural effusion ) consist platinum-based chemotherapy ( 15,16 ) . However , many open question management patient , role 3-drugs combination , non-platinum-based therapy , new biologic therapeutic ' approach . Currently , treatment advance NSCLC response rate 20 % -30 % median survival time 6 11 month achieve ( 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , ) . Several combination drug use show similar efficacy . Cisplatin plus vinorelbine Cisplatin plus Gemcitabine among commonly use regimens first-line therapy NSCLC .</brief_summary>
