Procedures conduct part routine clinical management subject ( e.g. , blood count , image study ) obtain prior sign inform consent may utilize Screening Baseline purpose provide test obtain specify protocol ) . Female subject ≥18 year age newly diagnose advanced gynaecological malignancy carboplatin paclitaxel base chemotherapy indicate . Patients may surgery debulk resect disease may receive chemotherapy radiotherapy . Histological confirmation follow : epithelial ovarian cancer , endometrial carcinoma , uterine sarcoma , mixed Müllerian tumour , fallopian tube carcinoma , primary peritoneal carcinoma , cervical carcinoma vulvar carcinoma . Performance status must ECOG 0 1 . Adequate organ system function define Table 6 Table 6 Definitions Adequate Organ Function System ( Laboratory Values ) Hematologic : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ( ≥ 1.5 X 109/L ) Hemoglobin1 ( ≥9 g/dL ) Platelets ( ≥100 X 109/L ) International normalize ratio ( INR ) ( ≤ 1.2 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) ) Partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) ( ≤1.2 X ULN ) Hepatic : p Total bilirubin ( ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) ) AST ALT ( ≤ 2.5 X ULN ) Renal : Serum Creatinine ( ≤ 1.5 mg/dL ) Or , serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL , ( ≥ 50 mL/min ) Calculated creatinine clearance Urine Protein Creatinine Ratio2 ( &lt; 1 ) Patients may transfusion within 7 day screen assessment . If UPC ≥1 , 24hour urine protein must assess . Patients must 24hour urine protein value &lt; 1g eligible . Measurable nonmeasurable disease . A female subject eligible enter participate study : Of nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , physiologically incapable become pregnant ) include woman : Has hysterectomy , Has bilateral oophorectomy ( ovariectomy ) , Has bilateral tubal ligation , Is postmenopausal Subjects use hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) must experience total cessation menses ≥ 1 year great 45 year age , OR , questionable case , follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) value &gt; 40 mIU/mL estradiol value &lt; 40pg/mL ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) . Subjects use hormone replacement therapy whose menopausal status doubt require use highly effective method contraception ( outline inclusion criterion ) wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , subject must discontinue HRT prior study enrollment allow confirmation post menopausal status . For form HRT , least 24 week must elapse cessation HRT determination menopausal status ; length interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation post menopausal status , subject resume HRT study without use contraception . Childbearing potential , include female negative serum pregnancy test within 2 week prior first dose study treatment , preferably close first dose possible , agree use adequate contraception .

Doublebarrier contraception ( condom spermicidal jelly , foam suppository , film ; diaphragm spermicide ; male condom diaphragm spermicide ) . Note : Oral contraceptive reliable due potential drugdrug interaction . Female subject lactate discontinue nursing prior first dose study drug refrain nursing throughout treatment period 14 day follow last dose study drug . Recovered effect surgery . Prior radiotherapy permissible , provide least 4 week elapse since last treatment allow full bone marrow recovery . Exclusion Criteria A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Prior use anticancer therapy ( except cytoreductive surgery [ debulking ] ) cancer .
