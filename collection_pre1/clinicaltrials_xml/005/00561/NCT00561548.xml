	<brief_title>Impact Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) Antibodies T-lymphocyte Macrophage Cooperation Crohn Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn disease inflammatory disease frequency increase last 25 year . The physiopathology involve failure negative regulatory mechanism inflammatory response intestine , along excessive production TNF-α T-lymphocytes macrophage lamina propria . Anti-TNF-α antibody usually give good therapeutic result , particular patient resistent dependant steroid . Nevertheless , Crohn disease , destructive T-lymphocytes - macrophage interaction , inhibition anti-TNFα , impact antibody cellular signal remain largely unknown . Two group 10 patient active Crohn disease , without azathioprine , require start anti-TNF treatment include study . Rectosigmoïdal biopsies blood test do start treatment 10 week treatment . Surface antigen , cytokine cellular molecule number apoptotic cell analyze FACS , quantification RNA analyze RT-PCR . This therefore enable u study , anti-TNF-α , patient treat azathioprine , intestinal blood lymphocyte , production cytokine involve lymphocyte-macrophage interaction , potential role regulatory T cell .</detailed_description>
