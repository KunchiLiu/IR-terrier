	<brief_summary>Renal Compromise treatment decompensated heart failure diuretic uncommon . The purpose study investigate relationship cystatin C worsen renal function set . Cystatin C biomarker produce constant rate cell sensitive biomarker renal function.Cystatin C Plasma amino terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) level obtain baseline daily . Our goal enroll 100 subject estimate 5 sample per subject . The time course change cystatin C relation serum creatinine level time plot . Our hypothesis sequential change cystatin C level follow initial treatment diuretic therapy set acute decompensated heart failure may provide early insight cardio-renal compromise . Understanding natural history time course change sequential cystatin C level may facilitate study guide judicious use diuretic therapy acute decompensated heart failure , predict risk subsequent development worsen renal function . If serial test cystatin C provide accurate assessment prediction worsen renal function , clinical application observation evaluate future prospective study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-center , prospective , cohort study . The design pilot study focus feasibility complete project short period time applicant . Subjects identify morning hospital admission inform consent obtain study . At time enrollment blood sample urine sample collect baseline , together brief history physical examination document degree congestion basic vital sign . In addition unused ( discard ) blood sample previous clinical lab admission may retrieve clinical laboratory . Patients follow daily , day blood draw urine sample obtain research purpose day discharge . Changes vital sign , available laboratory data serum creatinine BUN , congestion score document . Physicians treat patient blind laboratory result . Because small sample size low anticipate rate adverse event , study us combine outcome either death hospital , death within 90 day discharge readmission hospital facility heart failure within 90 day . Patients call 90 day follow readmission death information available Electronic Medical Record . Specific aim include : Specific Aim 1 - To examine natural history change sequential cystatin C level diuretic therapy Acute Decompensated Heart Failure . Specific Aim 2 - To determine predictive value change sequential cystatin C level subsequent development worsen renal function ( WRF ) WRF association aminoterminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) level .</detailed_description>
