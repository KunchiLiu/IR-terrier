	<brief_title>Valproic Acid Bevacizumab Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bevacizumab design prevent slow growth cancer cell block growth blood vessel . Valproic acid work way bevacizumab also use treatment seizure , migraine headache , mood disturbance bipolar disorder . If find eligible take part study , receive study drug outpatient . You receive bevacizumab vein 90 minute ( first infusion ) every 2 week . Once study doctor determines able tolerate drug , give 60 minute second infusion 30 minute infusion . Valproic acid give mouth ( capsule ( ) ) day 28 day . You take valproic acid twice day depend dose . Every 28 day consider 1 cycle . You blood draw ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test every cycle , every 1-2 week , researcher monitor safety study drug . Once every 8 week tumor marker test part routine blood draw . You physical exam cycle . You either CT MRI scan tumor every 8 week check status ( whether grow shrink ) cancer . If doctor think test necessary he/she discus . You continue receive bevacizumab valproic acid long disease consider stable . You receive 12 cycle study drug . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study . You end-of-study visit 28 day last dose bevacizumab . At visit , complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign blood pressure . You neurological exam , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine tumor marker test . You ask medication may take whether side effect . You also ask well able perform daily activity . This investigational study . Bevacizumab valproic acid FDA approve commercially available . Their use together study investigational authorize use research . Up 80 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients pathologically confirm malignancy metastatic unresectable refractory standard therapy standard therapy induce complete remission ( CR ) least 10 % increase survival least 3 month . 2 . There maximum allowable number prior chemotherapy regimen , provide eligibility criterion meet . 3 . ECOG performance status less 2 . 4 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,000/mcL platelet great 50,000/mcL total bilirubin le 2 mg/dl creatinine le 2 mg/dl 5 . The effect bevacizumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason valproic acid know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men may impregnate woman must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 6 . Ability understand willingness sign MD Anderson IRB approve write informed consent document . 7 . Both men woman race ethnic group eligible trial . 1 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior receive first dose study drug recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier.Patients may receive palliative radiation immediately ( ) treatment provide radiation target lesion available . 2 . Patients may receive investigational agent 28 day prior first dose drug study , pt receive study drug . 3 . Patients whose brain mets primary brain tumor include symptoms opinion principle investigator would either put patient unacceptable risk great risk underlie cancer treatment would unacceptably confound analysis toxicity assessment . 4 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition bevacizumab valproic acid . 5 . Major surgery within previous four week . 6 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , HTN ( 2 antihypertensive ) , unstable angina pectoris psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 7 . Pregnant woman exclude study valproic acid agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother valproic acid bevacizumab , breastfeed discontinue mother treated agent . 8 . Patient already antiepileptic agent , example ; phenytoin , valproic acid , neurontin exclude .</criteria>
