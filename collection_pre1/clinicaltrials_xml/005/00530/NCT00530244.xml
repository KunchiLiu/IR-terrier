	<detailed_description>This study bring together several area CF non-CF research : finding CF knock-out mouse exhibit abnormality AA/DHA ratio membrane bound fatty acid tissue express CFTR ; fact high dos DHA feed CF knock-out mouse correct many abnormality see animal ; research fatty acid content human breast milk ; effect breast feed CF ; fact newborn screen CF become widespread may allow therapeutic intervention early life . This first study aware look therapeutic intervention child diagnose CF newborn screening . Fatty Acid Metabolism CF It recognize year patient CF abnormality fatty acid profile . ( 1 ) Initially , felt secondary malabsorption essential fat . However , 1986 , Strandvik 's laboratory propose abnormality fatty acid turnover ( specifically arachidonic acid metabolism ) primary problem patient CF ( 2 ) . More recently , Freedman et al ( 3 ) show CFTR knockout mouse abnormality membrane bound long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid CFTR express tissue increase ratio arachidonic acid ( AA ) docosahexanoic acid ( DHA ) compare control animal . They also show therapy formula fortify high dos DHA reverse lipid abnormality ameliorate pancreatic duct change see mouse decrease inflammatory response inhale lipopolysaccharide ( 3,4 ) . Freedman et al ( 5 ) go show abnormalities membrane bound fatty acid CFTR express tissue human similar see CF knockout mouse . They Strandvik et al ( 6 ) show fatty acid abnormality dependent genotype severe fatty acid abnormality find patient `` severe '' mutation ( mutation associate pancreatic insufficiency ) . That abnormality primary part disease secondary malabsorption support fact obligate heterozygotes fatty acid abnormality intermediate affected individual normal control ( 5 ) . In summary , fatty acid abnormality appear primary defect CF directly relate patient 's genotype . Furthermore , dietary correction fatty acid imbalance improve symptoms mouse . Previous human study look correction fatty acid imbalance CF patient focus 18 carbon precursor AA DHA ( reference 7 , example ) use brief treatment period eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) ( effective Freedman 's mouse ) individual already establish disease ( 8 ) . Human Breast Milk Breast Feeding CF Human breast milk contains low level DHA standard infant formula ( 9 ) . Traditional infant formula Similac Enfamil 18 carbon fatty acid source long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid . These include linoleic acid ( 18 carbon , 2 double bond , last double bond 6 carbon methyl end ; 18:2n-6 ) linolenic acid ( 18:3n-3 ) . Eighteen carbon fatty acid may desaturated elongated make AA ( 20:4n-6 ) DHA ( 22:6n-3 ) incorporate membrane phospholipid ( 10 ) . Alternately , 18 carbon fatty acid 0-oxidized mitochondrion use energy source . AA DHA necessary brain growth . ( 11 ) The rapid period brain growth third trimester seem likely important period time accumulation fatty acid fetus . Prematurely born infant miss placental transfer AA DHA last trimester . They also likely need use long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid energy source since may limit caloric intake increase caloric expenditure due respiratory disease . It surprising , therefore , AA DHA supplement formula would find profound effect upon pre-term term infant . In fact , new formula contain AA DHA find improve neurodevelopment premature infant ( 12 ) . However , controversy whether neurodevelopmental advantage term infant feed fatty acid supplement formula author report benefit ( 13 ) others ( include large , double blind , randomize study ( 14 ) find difference term infant feed standard formula give long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplement formula . Since brain tissue express CFTR brain level AA DHA abnormal Freedman 's mouse experiment ( 3 ) , seem unlikely full term human CF would neurodevelopmental problem relate decrease brain DHA level different general population . There limited reserve n-3 fatty acid tissue result faster onset DHA AA depletion infant limit intake fatty acid . This could exaggerate infant CF CFTR express tissue already low DHA . Dietary AA DHA preferentially acylated tissue structural lipid , whereas dietary 18 carbon n-3 n-6 fatty acid readily use energy source ( 10 ) . Thus infant ( premature infant possibly CF infant ) long chain fatty acid may essential dietary component . The 20 22 carbon n-3 fatty acid ( EPA DHA ) inhibit 0-6 desaturase reduce synthesis AA linoleic acid ( 18:2 n-6 ) . ( 10 ) Therefore , unbalanced addition DHA infant diet may result abnormal tissue fatty acid composition . Taking advantage desaturase inhibition feed infant formula DHA without AA might beneficial infant CF assume intrinsically elevate AA tissue level decrease DHA level . However , strategy test since normal AA/DHA ratio non-CFTR express tissue strategy might put CF infant risk abnormal brain development alter normal neural AA/DHA ratio . It seem prudent provide AA DHA CF infant level consistent find human breast milk . There great deal variation human breast milk long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid content depend mother 's diet DHA level range little 0.2 % fatty acid woman vegetarian diet 2.78 % fatty acid Chinese woman marine diet ( 9,15 ) . DHA grant GRAS status ( `` generally recognize safe '' ) FDA , clear way addition infant formula . Recently , Mead Johnson Ross Laboratories release infant formula enrich long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid , specifically AA DHA . Many study demonstrate safety formula ( 13,14,16,17 ) . Given breast milk contain low level DHA traditional formula , reasonable think breast feeding might beneficial child CF . Very study look question . In 1960s 1970s several author warn breast feed felt precipitate hypoproteinemic , edematous state ( 18,19 ) By 1990 77 % CF Centers recommend breast feeding infant CF ( mean 23 % ) . ( 20 ) In 1991 Holliday et al ( 21 ) able demonstrate improve growth CF infant breast fed compare . This study show breast feed safe infant CF possibly beneficial . A recent nationwide survey demonstrate association breast feeding improve outcome CF individual ( 22 ) . Whether due DHA , constituent breast milk find commercial formula , social factor clear . Related survey result observation CFTR knockout mouse develop pancreatic insufficiency CF gastrointestinal symptom wean mother 's milk ( Steven Freedman , personal communication ) . Mouse breast milk , like human milk , contain DHA . Although 15 % human CF bear obvious pancreatic insufficiency bowel obstruction ( meconium ileus ) , many symptomatic day one life . Pancreatic insufficiency appear continuous , discrete , variable change pancreatic sufficiency status time see many patient . In one study , sixty percent infant CF diagnose use newborn screening note pancreatic insufficient diagnosis determine 72 hour fecal fat study ( 23 ) . By 12 month age fat malabsorption see 92 % cohort . These result similar Waters et al ( 24 ) also saw increase prevalence pancreatic dysfunction time . It speculate early intervention DHA contain formula might slow inflammatory destruction pancreas see human first year life . LIPIL , manufacture Mead Johnson 0.32 % fat DHA . Mead Johnson make formula three time amount DHA study . The study formula , designate LIPIL x 3 , 0.96 % fatty acid DHA retain AA concentration ( 0.64 % ) commercial formula . This formula meet FDA GRAS designation require IND use clinical trial . Human infant thrive decade standard formula available ; remain unclear term infant derive benefit long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supply new formula . Evidence indicate term infant well either conventional fatty acid supplement formula ethical dilemma double-blind comparison formula . Newborn Screening CF Many state begin perform newborn screen cystic fibrosis . For example , Massachusetts begin screen CF February 1999 . This program utilize IRT measurement 39 mutation analysis . This prove good detecting child CF early life , median age diagnosis 16 day ( Anne Commeau , personal communication ) . Many state begin perform newborn screen CF use similar algorithm IRT/IRT algorithm two blood sample analyze IRT day apart . Compared child diagnose conventional method , Farrell et al ( 25,26 ) show improvement nutritional status CF patient detect newborn screening . It believe improved nutrition lead improve pulmonary function later life , date proven . In fact , find possible newborn screening could lead early acquisition Pseudomonas aeruginosa worry clinician utility newborn screen disease ( 27,28 ) . Thus , CF detect early life use newborn screen show lead nutritional possibly pulmonary benefit time . It goal study see simple intervention early life child diagnose CF via newborn screen make difference progression disease . It hypothesize human respond DHA similar fashion CFTR knockout mouse , supplementation infant ' diet DHA early life provide protection pancreatic disease pulmonary inflammation .</detailed_description>
