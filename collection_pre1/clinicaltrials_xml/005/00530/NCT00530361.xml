	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Nesiritide Heart Failure Patients With Reduced Kidney Function Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Requiring Cardiopulmonary Bypass ( CPB Pump Heart Lung Machine )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , coronary artery become clogged calcium fatty deposit . The deposit , call plaque , narrow artery carry blood heart muscle could cause ischemic heart disease ( little blood oxygen reach heart muscle ) . Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG ) surgery treatment option ischemic heart disease . CABG surgery surgery create new route blood flow around narrow blocked artery heart muscle receive need oxygen nutrient . Acute kidney injury serious risk CABG surgery CPB pump ( heart-lung machine ) , could result ischemia follow surgery . This study double-blind ( neither patient doctor know whether patient assign receive study drug placebo ) , randomize ( assign treatment chance ) , placebo-controlled ( study drug result compare placebo result ) study determine effectiveness nesiritide compare placebo give HF patient undergo CABG surgery require use CPB pump . The study drug ( nesiritide ) placebo dose study 0.010 mcg/kg/min via continuous IV infusion . The study hypothesis compare placebo , nesiritide reduce kidney ischemia , preserve glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , measure rate kidney filter blood , need dialysis occurrence death HF patient undergone heart bypass surgery require use cardiopulmonary bypass machine . Safety assess collection adverse event , clinical laboratory test , vital sign , physical examination electrocardiograms various time point throughout study . The patient assign nesiritide group receive continuous I.V . infusion 0.010 mcg/kg/min nesiritide least 48 hour could extend 96 hour . The patient assign placebo group receive match placebo .</detailed_description>
