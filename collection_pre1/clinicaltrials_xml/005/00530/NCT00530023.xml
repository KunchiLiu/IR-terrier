	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Training Pump Naïve Subjects To Use The Paradigm® System And Evaluate Effectiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many subject Type 1 diabetes continue manage disease utilizing multiple daily injection , despite frequent blood glucose check , unable control glycemic variability lower A1C level . The MiniMed Paradigm REAL-Time System transmit sensor glucose value insulin pump every 5 minute , allow user view current glucose value well glycemic excursion trend 24-hour period . The System also alert user high low glucose level , allow subject clinician make carefully monitor modification therapy . Additionally , data upload monitor personal computer , allow subject clinician see complete picture trend time . Subjects learn technology would require new approach training master operation insulin pump , make effective use sensor technology understand complete picture provide software component . Subjects train first use insulin pump , add sensor utilize software effectiveness training method time measure use questionnaire design evaluate understanding device , Self Efficacy User Acceptance . The group wear System also compare subject continue current MDI therapy 15-week time period .</detailed_description>
