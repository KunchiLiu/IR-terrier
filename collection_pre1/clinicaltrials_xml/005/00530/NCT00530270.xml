	<brief_summary>People sickle cell disease ( SCD ) may develop acute chest syndrome ( ACS ) , common serious lung condition usually require hospitalization . Dexamethasone medication may decrease hospitalization time people ACS , may also bring new sickle cell pain . This study evaluate effectiveness dexamethasone regimen include gradual dose reduction decrease hospitalization recovery time people SCD ACS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Treat Acute Chest Syndrome People With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCD inherit blood disorder . Symptoms include anemia , infection , organ damage , intense episode pain , call `` sickle cell crisis . '' ACS life-threatening , lung-related complication SCD low level oxygen blood . Repeat occurrences ACS cause lung damage . It second common cause hospitalization among people SCD account 25 % premature deaths people SCD . Symptoms ACS include fever , chest pain , cough , breathe difficulty . ACS appear suddenly often require immediate hospitalization treatment , include antibiotic , supplemental oxygen , blood transfusion . Previous study show dexamethasone , type steroid medication block inflammation , decrease hospitalization time people ACS ; however , participant early study re-hospitalized due new sickle cell pain . Slowly decreasing dosage dexamethasone period time may decrease chance new sickle cell pain occur . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness dexamethasone regimen include gradual dose reduction decrease hospitalization recovery time people SCD ACS . This study enroll people SCD hospitalize diagnosed ACS within past 24 hour . Participants randomly assign receive either dexamethasone placebo daily basis 8 day . Every 2 day medication dose gradually reduce . While hospital , participant receive usual care ACS , include antibiotic , pain control medication , intravenous fluid , need treatment . Each day , participant undergo physical exam , pain assessment score , test measure oxygen level body , blood collection , , need , chest x-ray . Vital sign blood pressure measurement take every 4 hour . Study staff document amount pain medication , blood transfusion , oxygen , breathe treatment participant receive . Upon leave hospital , follow-up visit occur 1 week participant originally admit hospital ( participant still hospitalize time attend visit ) 1 month hospital discharge . At visit , information hospital visit pain treatment blood transfusion collect , evaluation perform earlier study repeat . The second visit also include lung function test .</detailed_description>
