	<brief_title>Tibial Nerve Stimulation Faecal Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Faecal incontinence common problem , affect approximately 2 % adult general population . Initial management involve dietary advice , anti−diarrhoeal medication , behavioural therapy . In benefited conservative technique sacral nerve stimulation establish effective treatment faecal incontinence . This treatment involve use electrical pulse stimulate S3 nerve root − nerve bottom back . These nerve supply low end bowel , anal sphincter . It believe stimulation sensory fibre head back towards spinal cord level important therapeutic effect . To stimulate sacral nerve however require two operation general anaesthetic , surgical implantation expensive nerve stimulator . The tibial nerve also contain fibre arise S3 part spinal cord . Electrical stimulation tibial nerve therefore send sensory information back region spinal cord sacral nerve stimulation . The tibial nerve much easily accessible inside ankle , allow stimulation carry outpatient without need surgery . It perform either percutaneously ( fine needle place skin sit next nerve ) , transcutaneously . Tibial nerve stimulation successfully use patient urinary incontinence . There small study look tibial nerve stimulation faecal incontinence show benefit , study control . We aim determine randomise controlled trial whether either percutaneous transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation effective treatment faecal incontinence .</detailed_description>
