	<detailed_description>Every participant receive active treatment ; placebo . Participants qualify randomly assign treatment either alemtuzumab SC interferon beta-1a 2:1 ratio ( , 2 give alemtuzumab every 1 give interferon beta-1a ) . Alemtuzumab administer two annual course , begin study 1 year later . Interferon beta-1a self-injected 3 time per week 2 year . All participant require return study site every 3 month neurologic assessment . In addition , safety-related laboratory test perform least monthly . Participation study end 2 year start treatment participant . Additionally , participant receive alemtuzumab might follow CAMMS03409 ( NCT00930553 ) extension study safety efficacy assessment .
