	<brief_title>Effects Radiation Therapy Body Patients With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine energy protein consumption average radiotherapy treatment day use multiple pas method 24-hour analysis food recall baseline treatment end . - To compare energy protein mouth intake baseline treatment end . - To measure compare diet quality baseline radiotherapy treatment end Healthy Eating Index ( HEI ) score . - To determine lean body mass versus fat mass use bioelectrical impedance analysis machine . - To compare body fat lean body mass percentage baseline radiotherapy treatment end . - To correlate energy protein consumption lean body mass baseline treatment end . - To determine change appetite throughout radiotherapy compare data obtain interview baseline radiotherapy treatment end . - To determine change performance level ( Karnofsky percentage ) associate radiotherapy series question ask baseline treatment end . OUTLINE : Patients receive radiotherapy plan 7 week . Patients undergo interview treatment day 1 ( initiation radiotherapy ) treatment day 35 ( completion radiotherapy ) regard recent food consumption history appetite . Patients ' stand weight height measure day body composition , measure bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) device , also take . Patients ' Karnofsky performance score obtain medical record .</detailed_description>
