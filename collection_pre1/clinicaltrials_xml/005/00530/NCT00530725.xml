	<brief_summary>Collapsed lung common injury traumatic injury regularly cause needless death despite treatable chest tube . Properly use tubes life-saving . Unfortunately , improperly use cause pain , bleeding , fatal complication . Over last decade increase use CT scan apparent many small collapse lung see chest X-rays , little guidance treat Doctors treat patient . There almost good data tell u whether small pneumothoraces require treatment chest tube whether simply closely watch . This proposal carry simple trial randomly assign patient appear symptom problem occult pneumothorax either standard chest tube watch . Our careful review medical literature indicate investigator honestly tell patient family treatment best require . Our audit current practice also indicate Doctors Calgary across Canada , regularly prescribe treatment regularly hap-hazard . The patient study closely watch intensive care unit develop breathe problem chest tube , one insert . The main result investigator try determine pilot study , though , whether investigator able detect appropriate patient , recruit study , whether guideline investigator create manage patient study acceptable patient 's care giver . This data help u design future large multi-centre trial hopefully provide information best manage type injured patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Management Occult Pneumothoraces Mechanically Ventilated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The term `` Occult Pneumothorax '' ( OPTX ) , describes pneumothorax ( PTX ) suspect basis either clinical examination plain radiograph , ultimately detect thoraco-abdominal computed tomograms ( CT ) . This situation increasingly common contemporary trauma care increase use CT . The incidence appear approximately 5 % injured population present hospital , CT reveal least twice many PTXs suspect plain radiograph . While PTXs common treatable ( chest drainage ) cause mortality morbidity , clinical equipoise significant disagreement regard appropriate treatment OPTX . Based level III evidence , author recommend observation without chest drainage large OPTXs , recommendation contravene standard dictum ventilate patient recommend Advanced Trauma Life Support Course American College Surgeons . The controversy great critical care unit population require positive pressure ventilation . This also group high rate chest tube complication report . Complication rate related chest tubes general , claim 21 % case . No previous study focus specifically population mechanically ventilated patient . There 45 report ventilated trauma patient ever randomize treatment observation . Enderson find 8 ( 53 % ) 15 patient PTX progression 3 tension pneumothoraces . Brasel find 9 observed OPTXs , 2 progress . Brasel conclude observation safe , Enderson felt chest tubes mandatory . The investigator thus propose carry prospective randomize trial examine need chest drainage small moderate size OPTX 's , well practicality carry study . The experience knowledge gain pilot intend provide additional support future submission Canadian Institute Health Research order carry multi-centre prospective trial involve member institution Canadian Trauma Trials Collaborative ( CTTC ) . The investigator believe invested time effort develop line investigation group World . The investigator first review pertinent literature subsequently retrospectively review outcome entity institution collaborator CTTC site . The investigator examine anatomic practical reason OPTXs occult , well novel investigation method detect initial evaluation trauma , document morbidity may occur treatment .</detailed_description>
