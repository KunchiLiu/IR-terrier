	<brief_title>The Effect Early Iron Deficiency Developmental Brain Behavior Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iron deficiency ( ID ) common single nutrient disorder world . Pregnant woman child pre-school age high risk . Data animal model provide evidence early ID affect develop brain specific region function varies process include myelination , dopamine neurotransmitter system , neurometabolism . These impact appear differential different time brain development different brain region , depend time ID . The reversibility effect also appear depend timing ID . This project use innovative neuropsychologic/ neurophysiologic behavioral technique , event-related potential ( ERP ) , ABR VEP , study brain function behavior relate ID include sensory , motor , cognitive social /emotional functioning , address unanswered question brain behavior impact different time ID ( pre- /or postnatal ID ) human infant . This research potential understand reversibility effect depend time ID treatment well basic understand mechanism impact ID human develop brain . It may also important implication regard policy intervention different time ID , improve child early development quality population .</detailed_description>
