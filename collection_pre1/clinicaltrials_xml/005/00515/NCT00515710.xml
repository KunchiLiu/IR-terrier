	<brief_summary>Several subject enrol multi-site , gene transfer clinical study evaluate intrahepatic administration AAV2-hFIX16 vector treatment severe hemophilia B 2001 2009 . As US FDA establish guideline long-term follow-up ( LTFU ) subject receive investigational gene therapy product , protocol seek characterize clinical outcome type seriousness adverse event follow AAV gene transfer . The primary study tool consist annual history/physical examination blood test , well periodic liver ultrasound , characterize clinical outcome . Where possible , data obtain 15 year follow hepatic AAV2-hFIX16 gene transfer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LTFU Gene Transfer Subjects With Hemophilia B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prior clinical gene transfer study intrahepatic adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) vector administration factor IX gene ( AAV2-hFIX16 ) adult subject severe hemophilia B enrol several subject 2001 2004 . These subject receive various dos AAV2-hFIX16 manufacture Avigen , Inc. ( Alameda , CA ) . They monitor least one year follow vector administration evaluation adverse event index efficacy . At time study enrollment suspend Avigen , Inc. , IND 9398 study conduct transfer The Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( May 2005 ) , guideline long-term follow-up trial subject . However , unrelated study conduct France , pediatric subject administer integrate retrovirus vector X-linked severe combine immune deficiency ( X-SCID ) , several leukemia developed year transfer γc common chain gene . The underlie mechanism attribute proviral integration near , upregulation , proto-oncogenes LMO-2 , couple robust expression γc common chain , induce unregulated cellular proliferation . In response event , concert NIH gene transfer scientific community , U.S. Food Drug Administration ( US FDA ) issue guideline 'long-term follow-up gene transfer subject ' . Since AAV vector low rate genomic integration , risk integration low , long-term effect persistence vector particle human unknown . The investigator plan enroll available subject prior intrahepatic AAV gene transfer study observational study follow 15 year gene transfer . An additional subject receive AAV2-hFIX16 vector , manufacture CCMT CHOP , via hepatic artery infusion January 2009 . The study AAV2-hFIX-002 , amendment prior Avigen , Inc. clinical protocol modify include transient immunomodulation , conduct IND 9398 . This subject monitor three year follow vector administration clinical study AAV2-hFIX-002 ; amendment one current protocol transfer annual long-term follow-up visit AAV2-hFIX16-LTFU-01 . Spark Therapeutics study sponsor ; prior vector administration sit referral/follow site participate study site . The long-term follow-up ( LTFU ) study consist primarily endpoints include annual history , physical examination , blood test , urinalysis , periodic liver ultrasound . Adverse event report focus development oncologic , hematologic , neurologic auto-immune event follow gene transfer specify November 2006 FDA Center Biologics Evaluation Research ( CBER ) guidance document entitle , `` Gene Therapy Clinical Trials - Observing Subjects Delayed Adverse Events . `` 1 The LTFU study seek provide longitudinal information , adverse event occur , timely discovery treatment .</detailed_description>
