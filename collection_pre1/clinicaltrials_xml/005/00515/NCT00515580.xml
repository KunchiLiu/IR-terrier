	<brief_title>Minimally Invasive Tongue Suture For Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea common sleep-breathing disorder characterize repetitive complete cessation breathe due pharyngeal obstruction . Untreated , strongly associate daytime sleepiness , hypertension , depression , coronary artery disease , stroke , even death . It estimate 25 % men 9 % woman may suffer condition . One propose mechanism pharyngeal obstruction posterior tongue susceptible collapse supine sleep , cause collapse soft palate relate structure . Treatment include continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , mandibular advancement device , various surgical option . There many surgical option treat tongue base collapse , many morbid significant pain discomfort involve . Silhouette Sutures ( Kolster Methods , Inc. ) design hold grip soft tissue use intermittently place dissolvable cone space knot . It use widely year facial cosmetic procedure excellent result safety record . This pilot study evaluate practicality efficacy use Silhouette Sutures innovative , minimally invasive technique obviates need aggressive morbid procedure obstructive sleep apnea .</detailed_description>
