	<brief_summary>Health-care-acquired infection tremendous importance patient , especially catheter-associated infection . More 40 % bloodstream infection associated central venous catheter ( CVC ; catheter insert large vein near heart ) . Of patient acquire infection 1 % 5 % die result . The insertion site main source contamination infection . In general , bacteria skin cause infection , especially short-term CVCs ( 10-14 day ) . Therefore necessary efficiently disinfect skin preparation care CVC insertion site . Several substance use disinfection . Alcohol-based disinfectant mainly use Central Europe , preparation contain povidine-iodine chlorhexidine . Alcoholic disinfectant rapid initial effect , chlorhexidine show additional remanent ( longer last ) effect . A substance , octenidine dihydrochloride , also demonstrate remanent effect pilot study neurosurgical patient . The purpose study compare alcohol-based disinfectant contain octenidine dihydrochloride pure alcoholic disinfectant regard efficacy tolerability patient receive CVC minimum 5 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention Catheter-Associated Infection With Skin Disinfectant Octenidine Dihydrochloride</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catheter-associated infection one eminent healthcare acquire infection . More 40 % bloodstream infection associated central venous catheter ( CVC ) 1 % 5 % affected patient die direct consequence infection . The important microorganism gram-positive cocci ( S. aureus , S. epidermidis ) . In intensive care unit gram-negative microorganism pseudomonas , acinetobacter candida spp . frequent . The insertion site main source contamination infection short-term CVCs ( 10-14 day . In case infection cause migration microorganism along outside catheter . Contamination hub due frequent manipulation usually source infection long-term CVCs . In case infection occur intraluminally . An effective skin disinfection main measure prevention insertion CVC . The aim measure elimination transient reduction resident microorganism around insertion site . To achieve , disinfectant basis alcohol , povidone-iodine chlorhexidine apply . Alcohol-based disinfectant preferred Central Europe rapid initial effect broad microbiological spectrum . Chlorhexidine povidone-Iodine contrast alcoholic disinfectant remanent effect reduces regrowth microorganisms beyond immediate initial effect . To extent remanent substance reduce colonization CVC extraluminally CVC-tip still dispute . In earlier clinical trial residual remanent effect 0.1 % octenidine combine propanol microbial skin decontamination 24h period show neurosurgical patient receive central line ( CVC peripherally inserted central catheter ) . The objective study therefore evaluate preventive impact tolerability commercially available , alcohol-based antiseptic solution contain octenidine preparation care CVC insertion sit clinical set comparison result give alcoholic solution alone .</detailed_description>
