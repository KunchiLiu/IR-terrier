	<brief_title>Lovaza 's Effect Activation Platelets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease remain leading cause death North America ( 1 ) . Uncontrolled platelet activation , adhesion aggregation initiate vessel wall plaque rupture think responsible acute vascular occlusion many situation ( 2-5 ) . Although many platelet inhibition drug available , currently available drug undesirable toxicity profile ( 6-8 ) . Thus , reduction toxicity improve management patient thrombotic disease remain unmet medical need . Platelet activation play pivotal role pathogenesis acute coronary syndrome , stroke thrombophilic disease . Atheromatous plaque rupture change shear force blood flow injured vessel surface also expose collagen well prothrombotic factor ( 9-11 ) . As initial hemostatic event , platelets become activated cover injure surface . Following platelet activation highly active substance like adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) thromboxane A2 ( TxA2 ) release platelet promote recruit platelet aggregation injury site ( 12 ) . If process proceeds unabated , often atherosclerotic disease , vessel becomes occlude infarction may follow . Lovaza® ( Reliant Pharmaceutical Inc. , Liberty Corner , NJ ) , commercially available formulation contain 90 % omega-3-acid ethyl ester ( 46 % eicosapentaenoic acid -EPA- 38 % docosohexaenoic acid -DHA- ) , potential ability modify recruitment additional platelet grow thrombus promote synthesis thromboxane A3 ( TxA3 ) , poor platelet activator , instead thromboxane A2 , potent platelet activator . Agents used inhibit platelet function aspirin clopidogrel always effective ( 13-16 ) . Unfortunately , patient respond therapeutic ( 17-24 ) . Realistic number patient resistance drug probably 10-15 % ASA 20-30 % clopidogrel . Almost resistant patient less favorable outcome unaware potentially life-threatening problem severe cardiac adverse event occur . Lovaza® may add additional therapeutic benefit patient . ( 25,26 ) Beyond occasional patient complaint eructation `` fishy '' taste mouth , Lovaza® benign toxicity profile . If Lovaza® show clinically relevant anti-platelet effect , may use either replace reduce dose toxic anti-platelet agent . The proposed biochemical mechanism anti-platelet effect omega n3 fatty acid base modification platelet prostaglandin metabolism ( 27-31 ) . Cellular membrane primarily compose phospholipid ( PL ) . The backbone PL 's glycerol . The glycerol hydroxyl group position 1 2 bind two fatty acid molecule formation ester bond ( 31 ) . The third hydroxyl bind so-called head group , may choline , inositol , ethanolamine serine . At least case platelet fatty acid C-2 position often unsaturated arachidonic fatty acid ( omega n6 fatty acid ) . When Lovaza® ingest ( omega n3 fatty acid ) , unsaturated fatty acid C2 position DHA EPA . Several important difference result substitution include important effect platelet function . As part platelet activation process , phospholipase A2 clip fatty acid C-2 position , either arachidonic acid DHA/EPA ( 31 ) . In case platelet , fatty acid metabolize enzyme call COX-1 thromboxane ( 32-35 ) . When fatty acid arachidonic acid , thromboxane A2 synthesize ( TxA2 ) . TxA2 potent platelet activator vasoconstrictor . In case DHA EPA , series 3 TxA3 synthesize , poor platelet activator vasoconstrictor ( 32-35 ) . Production TxA3 underlie potential anti-platelet effect Lovaza® . The second effect DHA inclusion PL 's newly discover alteration cell membrane structure . It well establish DHA promote `` lipid raft '' formation cellular membrane ( 36-38 ) . These raft , primarily compose sphingomyelin cholesterol , form site transmembrane protein insert membrane . These transmembrane protein may sit ion channel receptor define important cellular function mean activate cell . Thus , DHA 's ability promote raft formation may profound beneficial effect platelet function . Since Lovaza®-alteration platelet membrane lead clinical benefit , assay determine lipid composition platelet membrane change ingestion Lovaza® carry . The concept experiment fairly simple . A standard well-established 1H NMR method use detect change lipid composition platelet membrane function Lovaza® dose ( 39-41 ) . From experiment able prove DHA EPA Lovaza® actually directly incorporated platelet membrane</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males female older 18 year old able ingest omega n3 fatty acid eligible trial : On antiplatelet anticoagulation therapy , OR On chronic therapy warfarin aspirin alone ( &lt; =325 mg/day ) combination therapy clopidogrel aspirin ( &lt; =325 mg/day ) . The subject must able read , understand , sign inform consent form follow protocol . To enrol study , subject must clinically stable stable medical therapy throughout duration study meet follow criterion : Healthy volunteer Volunteers stable coronary artery disease : Prior MI ( &gt; 1 month ) OR Prior revascularization : angioplasty ± stenting ( &gt; 1 month ) OR Coronary artery bypass grafting ( &gt; 3 month ) OR Documented disease coronary angiography . No planned plan procedure change medical therapy 24week duration study Volunteers stable atrial fibrillation : Ratecontrolled paroxysmal atrial fibrillation stable antiarrhythmic therapy . On stable dose warfarin regular followup anticoagulation ( `` coumadin '' ) clinic . No planned change antiarrhythmic therapy cardioversion duration study . No recent admission atrial fibrillation ( &gt; 3 month ) Subjects may ingest drug know cause significant platelet abnormality participate trial . ( See list prohibit medication , outline Section 9 ) Patients must assessable investigator schedule clinic visit duration trial . All female subject child bear potential must negative serum pregnancy test prior randomization plan get pregnant duration study . Any medical condition would preclude ingestion omega n3 fatty acid ( Lovaza® ) . Subjects take nutritional supplement fish oil flaxseed oil . These patient may become eligible willing discontinue nutritional supplement 2week washout period . Any medical condition would adversely affect study objective . Chronic medical condition know associate abnormal platelet function include : Liver dysfunction include abnormal liver function test ( AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase &gt; upper limit normal ) , know cirrhosis chronic hepatitis . Chronic kidney disease calculate creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min ( MDRD ) and/or serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl . History significant anemia , baseline hemoglobin &lt; 11.0 g/dl . Baseline PT &gt; ULN , INR &gt; 1.3 , aPTT &gt; ULN subject chronic warfarin therapy . History thrombocytopenia , baseline platelet count &lt; 100,000 History thrombocytosis , baseline platelet count &gt; 600,000 Known bleed diathesis and/or congenital hemostasis disorder and/or congenital platelet abnormality . Any history stroke past 12 month . History peptic ulcer disease past year gastrointestinal bleeding last 3 month . Genitourinary bleed last 3 month . HIV infectious disease would expose laboratory personnel unacceptable risk . Treatment within 30 day antiplatelet agent aspirin clopidogrel eptifibatide , tirofiban abciximab . Treatment within past 7 day unfractionated lowmolecular weight heparin . Allergy iodine , fish , component study drug . Alcohol substance abuse . Emotionally psychiatrically unstable .
