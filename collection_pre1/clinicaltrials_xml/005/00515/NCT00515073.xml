	<brief_title>Papillary Serous Carcinoma Endometrium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paclitaxel design block mechanism cell division cancer cell , may cause die . If find eligible take part study , begin treatment . You radiation treatment pelvis ( hip area ) every day ( Monday - Friday ) total 25 treatment . Each treatment take 20 minute complete . After radiation treatment , receive type radiation call `` vaginal cuff boost . '' The vaginal cuff boost involve small device insert vagina treat back vagina high dose radiation . The applicator similar place large tampon vagina . This internal treatment take 30 minute treatment . This separate external radiation treatment give . While receive radiation treatment , afterwards , also receive chemotherapy paclitaxel . During radiation period , receive paclitaxel vein 1 hour , Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 . Starting 4-6 week radiation treatment finish , receive paclitaxel large dose , give 3 hour time , every 21 day ( 3 week ) . You receive 4 `` cycle '' chemotherapy , cycle last 21 day . You give certain drug 30 minute chemotherapy treatment help control possible side effect , like allergic reaction . These drug include dexamethasone , diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) , cimetidine . You several test perform throughout study . Before cycle chemotherapy one month last cycle chemotherapy give , quality life symptom assessment form complete . These questionnaire take 15 minute complete . While chemotherapy treatment , test perform chemotherapy treatment . This involve blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test , review symptom study staff . Once study treatment , ask return clinic follow-up visit . These visit occur every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , year . At visit , physical pelvic exam perform , along blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Chest x-rays usually do year diagnostic exam do doctor think need . This investigational study . There standard treatment type endometrial cancer , radiation chemotherapy common treatment . This combination chemotherapy radiation consider experimental . Up 49 patient take part multicenter study . Up 44 participant enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
