	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) low extremity affect roughly 25 million Americans annually . The diabetic population particularly prone severe clinical problem associate PAD amputation rate amongst patient elevate five-fold . It show patient undergo amputation PAD/CLI much high mortality rate month follow . Despite medical advance field pharmacology wound care , vast majority patient present CLI ultimately require amputation absence improve blood flow . Recently , much attention direct towards less invasive endovascular solution treat patient CLI . This study evaluate approximately 140 subject Rutherford Class IV-VI PAD multi-center study order accurately estimate limb salvage rate treatment .</detailed_description>
