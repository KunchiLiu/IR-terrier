	<brief_title>Vaccination Plus Ontak Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , randomized phase II , single institution study compare administration 4-peptide melanoma vaccine alone post-Ontak , patient metastatic melanoma . Treatment : 1 . Cohort A : Vaccine alone . Patients receive immunization emulsion 4 melanoma peptide ( 250 mcg ) /GM-CSF/Montanide injected intradermally/subcutaneously day 1 . A second vaccination give 2 week later third vaccination 2 week . Patients re-evaluated around week 6 continue course 3 vaccination ( one every 2 week ) disease progression . 2 . Cohort B : Ontak plus vaccine . Patients receive Ontak ( 18 mcg/kg ) intravenously day -4 one dose . On day 0 , receive first immunization emulsion 4 melanoma peptide ( 250 mcg ) /GM-CSF/Montanide inject intradermally/subcutaneously . A second vaccination give 2 week later third vaccination 2 week . Patients re-evaluated around week 6 continue course 3 vaccination ( one every 2 week ) disease progression . However , Ontak give . Duration : Patients may remain study disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , patient choice withdraw , physician decision discontinue therapy ( due intervene illness , poor patient compliance , situation would increase patient risk ) .</detailed_description>
