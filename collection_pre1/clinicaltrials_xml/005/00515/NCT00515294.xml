	<brief_summary>The aim study develop information acute residual effect new product target young adult . Using double placebo-controlled 2 X 2 factorial model study design , compare acute residual effect drive impairment caffeinated alcohol , non-caffeinated alcohol , caffeinated placebo , non-caffeinated placebo . Under alcohol condition , participant receive sufficient alcoholic beverage attain blood alcohol concentration ( BAC ) .12 g % . Participants 144 undergraduate graduate student , recent college graduate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Caffeinated alcoholic beverage target young adult promise caffeine counteract sedate effect alcohol thus let consumer remain alert active longer , continue drink . It likely mind young people , promise also translate idea mix caffeine alcohol allow one drive safely would possible consume equivalent amount non-caffeinated alcoholic beverage . These dangerous assumption ( 1 ) alertness may indicate absence impairment intoxication ( 2 ) next-day impairment residual effect heavy drinking may exacerbate mix caffeine alcohol . We compare acute residual effect caffeinated non-caffeinated beer term highly relevant outcome - ability drive safely . The long-term objective program research investigate factor predict contribute performance decrement alcohol ingestion , focus behavior relevant public health , drive . The primary specific aim propose work : AIM 1 : To compare acute effect caffeinated alcohol , non-caffeinated alcohol , caffeinated placebo , non-caffeinated placebo driving-related impairment , measure performance drive simulator Psychomotor Vigilance Test ( PVT ) , test sustain attention/reaction time . We hypothesize caffeinated beverage result le impaired simulated driving ability well PVT performance acutely , compare non-caffeinated beverage , performance measure follow caffeinated non-caffeinated beverage impair relative placebo beverage . AIM 2 : To compare residual effect caffeinated alcohol , non-caffeinated alcohol , caffeinated placebo , non-caffeinated placebo next-day driving-related impairment , measure drive simulator PVT . We hypothesize caffeinated beverage result great impairment next-day simulated drive attention/reaction time , relative non-caffeinated beverage , performance follow caffeinated non-caffeinated alcoholic beverage impair relative corresponding placebo beverage . AIM 3 : To compare acute effect caffeinated alcohol , non-caffeinated alcohol , caffeinated placebo , non-caffeinated placebo self-rated ability drive , measure self assessment ability-to-drive questionnaire , estimate blood alcohol concentration ( BAC ) . We hypothesize caffeinated alcoholic beverage result great confidence ability drive low estimate BAC , compare non-caffeinated alcoholic beverage , alcoholic beverage , confidence driving ability lower estimate BAC great , relative placebo . AIM 4 : To compare residual effect caffeinated alcohol , non-caffeinated alcohol , caffeinated placebo , non-caffeinated placebo self-rated ability drive . We hypothesize caffeinated alcoholic beverage result low confidence ability drive high estimate BAC , compare non-caffeinated alcoholic beverage , alcoholic beverage , confidence driving ability lower estimate BAC great , relative placebo .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>College student , graduate student , recent graduate Between age 21 30 year inclusive ( verified valid driver license ) Who , student , report good academic standing Have diagnose sleep disorder Are daily smoker At least occasionally past month , consume five drink ( men ) ( four female [ base Flannery et al 2002 ] ) single drinking episode Have valid driver license , include people know drive . Scores 5 screening measure alcoholism ( short version Michigan Alcohol Screening Test [ SMAST ] ) A history counsel treatment chronic substance abuse selfreport Daily smoker ( mitigate confounding caffeine nicotine withdrawal , acute nicotine administration , smoker exclude participation ) Current use medication affect sleep/wake cycle daytime alertness contraindicate alcohol Presence health condition contraindicate alcohol Diagnosis sleep disorder ( sleep apnea , narcolepsy , periodic limb movement , restless legs syndrome , circadian rhythm disorder , insomnia ) Use recreational drug ( e.g. , marijuana ) participate study Working overnight shift Female pregnant , nursing , use reliable birth control Participants travel across two time zone last month reschedule late participation ( minimum 1 month timezone travel ) On average consume great 4 cup coffee per day ( &gt; 400 mg/day ) Participants report ever get motion sick screening become motion sick practice drive simulator Session 1 .
