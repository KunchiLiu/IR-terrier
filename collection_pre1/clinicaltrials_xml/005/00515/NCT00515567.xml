	<brief_title>Explanted Lung Tissues With Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary Fibrosis involve scar lung . Gradually , air sacs lung become replaced fibrotic tissue . The current thinking fibrotic process reaction tiny injury lung . When scar form , tissue become thicker cause permanent loss tissue 's ability carry oxygen bloodstream . We need obtain lung tissue patient without pulmonary fibrosis compare lung tissue patient pulmonary fibrosis .</detailed_description>
