	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability romiplostim ( AMG 531 ) treatment thrombocytopenia pediatric subject chronic ITP . We also evaluate efficacy romiplostim ( AMG 531 ) characterize pharmacokinetics romiplostim ( AMG 531 ) . It anticipate romiplostim ( AMG 531 ) , give effective dose schedule , well tolerate treatment thrombocytopenia among pediatric subject chronic ITP .</brief_summary>
