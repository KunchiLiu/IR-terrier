	<brief_summary>This study patient stomach cancer cancer lower part esophagus spread organ . There many different chemotherapy treatment type cancer . At present time , general agreement way choose beneficial therapy individual patient . Patients different genetic background may respond differently chemotherapy treatment . In study investigator use certain genetic difference important gene ( thymidylate synthase TS gene ) see whether treat patient particular type gene respond well standard chemotherapy regimen . The investigator hop treat patient accord gene , may respond treatment cancer good help investigator choose cancer treatment well future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacogenomically Selected Treatment Gastric Gastroesophageal Junction ( GEJ ) Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric gastroesophageal junction ( GEJ ) cancer lead cause cancer mortality . Despite development newer chemotherapy , response rate median survival patient tumor remain essentially stagnant . Defining host molecular/biologic tumor characteristic customize treatment may lead improved survival outcome . Retrospective study identify genetic marker predict treatment outcome . However , prospective study gastric GEJ cancer evaluate clinical utility genetic factor . We hypothesize genomically base treatment improve expect response rate patient gastric GEJ cancer . We propose prospective , multi-institutional Phase II clinical trial test germline polymorphism thymidylate synthase ( TS ) gene , number tandem repeat TS enhancer region ( TSER ) treatment selection marker . The polymorphic variant confer three tandem repeat ( TSER*3 ) associate 5-FU resistance due high tumor TS expression comparison TSER*2 variant ( two tandem repeat ) . The TSER*3 polymorphism common ( allelic frequency 0.5-0.8 ) . In proposed study , prospectively genotype patient gastric GEJ cancer . Patients expect 5-FU sensitive ( carry TSER*2 allele ) receive 5-FU contain regimen ( 5-FU , leucovorin , oxaliplatin ) . Patients expect 5-FU resistant ( homozygous TSER*3 ) include study . In complete study , determine whether treatment selection base germline TSER polymorphism status improve response rate patient metastatic gastric GEJ tumor . Additional correlative study propose identify confound factor may alter expect outcomes treatment approach .</detailed_description>
