	<detailed_description>Study Participation : Participants contact either initiation chemotherapy follow referral pain management service neuropathic cancer treatment-related pain . The sensory test take 1 hour complete . These test seek find threshold ( measure sensitivity ) perceive stimulus , touch , coolness , warmth , hot/cold feeling pinprick . You ask rate intensity stimuli perceive painful . You also ask rate intensity stimuli fix intensity pain threshold people . Your skin temperature use radiometer , scan finger and/or toe , groove peg board , time task place pegs slot , pain scale rating collect . Each part sensory test optional collect possible . You may either test repeated interval throughout chemotherapy later follow-up date check length symptom . Length Study : Your participation complete complete sensory testing . This investigational study . A total 450 patient enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
