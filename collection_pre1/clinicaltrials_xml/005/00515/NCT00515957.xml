	<brief_summary>In study NPC patient receive 4 day treatment CD45 antibody follow one dose LMP1- LMP2-CTL . From , learn treat patient first CD45 antibody also let LMP1- LMP2-CTL give grow well . In addition , find , LMP1- LMP2-CTL safe enhance anti-tumor activity comparison standard EBV-CTL . This study aim determine safety autologous LMP1- LMP2- specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes ( CTL ) combination CD45 monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) patient EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) . And obtain information expansion , persistence anti-tumor effect autologous LMP1- LMP-2 specific CTL give lymphodepletion CD45 MAb patient EBV-positive NPC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While patient nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) may cure chemotherapy radiotherapy , outlook patient resistant treatment relapse poor . Almost patient undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma EBV virus tumor may target immunotherapy approach . We successfully use specialize immune system cell grown laboratory train recognize kill EBV infect cell ( EBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes [ EBV-CTL ] ) prevent treat another type cancer call post transplant lymphoma occur bone marrow transplant . In post transplant lymphoma , tumor cell 9 protein make EBV surface . However nasopharyngeal carcinoma develop patient normal immune system , tumor cell express 2 EBV protein much hard immune system recognize . In previous study make EBV-CTL recognize 9 protein give patient NPC . For patient without evidence active disease time therapy , disease remain remission . For patient active disease time receive CTL , patient partial response therapy , three patient complete response . We think main reason many T cell react EBV protein tumor cell , infuse T cell enough space grow . The two EBV protein present NPC tumor cell good target T-cell therapy call LMP1 LMP2 . We therefore plan generate T cell specific LMP1 LMP2 infuse cell NPC patient . To make LMP1- LMP2-CTL , obtain blood patient grown special type cell call dendritic cell ( DC ) EBV infect lymphoblastoid cell ( LCL ) . We transfer adenovirus vector carry LMP1 LMP2 gene DC LCL . These DC LCL treat radiation grow use stimulate expand LMP1- LMP2-CTL . This stimulation train T cell kill cancer cell LMP1 LMP2 surface . To 'create space ' EBV-CTL growth infusion NPC patient already use special protein call CD45 antibody , remove short period time patient 's T cell . The preliminary result study encouraging : use CD45 antibody safe observe enhanced EBV-CTL growth infusion . In addition , patient EBV-CTL growth clinical response . We others demonstrate feasibility CTL therapy EBV-positive NPC immunocompetent patient , provide preliminary evidence anti-tumor activity EBV-CTL patient population . Not patient respond , however , suggest need improvement . We propose CTL failure overcome increase specificity infuse CTL product . That , infusion CTL specific LMP1 LMP2 produce great clinical benefit EBV-specific CTL . The rationale approach straight forward : EBV-specific CTL line generate standard method dominate T-cell clone reactive subdominant EBV proteins LMP1 LMP2 express NPC . We also propose failure adoptively transfer CTL measurably expand peripheral blood NPC patient consequence lymphoid homeostasis lympho-replete patient inhibitory T-cell infiltrate site disease . We therefore use monoclonal antibody target CD45 antigen ( CD45 MAbs ) , lymphodeplete NPC patient prior infusion EBV-specific CTL . Preliminary result indicate CD45 MAb depletion augment CTL expansion , expansion associate high disease response rate . We confirm extend promise new data Phase I clinical trial .</detailed_description>
