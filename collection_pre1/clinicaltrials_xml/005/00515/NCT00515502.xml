Female subject must nonchildbearing potential . An established clinical history COPD ( ATS/ERS definition ) . 'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) preventable treatable disease characterise airflow limitation fully reversible . The airflow limitation usually progressive associate abnormal inflammatory response lungs noxious particle gas , primarily cause cigarette smoking . Although COPD affect lung , also produce significant systemic consequence . ' Subject smoker exsmoker smoke history least 10 pack year ( 1 pack year = 20 cigarette smoke per day 1 year equivalent ) . Subject FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7 postbronchodilator ( salbutamol ) dose . Subject 40 ≥ FEV1 ≤ 80 % predict normal height , age gender inhalation salbutamol dose . Response ipratropium bromide . Subject able give write informed consent take part study . Subject available complete study measurement procedure . Subject 's BMI 18.0 32.0 kg/m2 . Subjects 24hr Holter record within normal limit demonstrate clinically important abnormality , opinion investigator , would make subject unsuitable participation study Subjects past present disease organ system , judge Investigator , may affect outcome study . The subject positive prestudy drug screen . A minimum list drug screen include Amphetamines , Barbiturates , Cannabis , Cocaine Opiates . The detection drug legitimate medical use would exclusion study participation . The subject positive prestudy alcohol screen . The detection alcohol would exclusion screen would need negative predose study . A suspected history alcohol abuse within six month previous screen visit .
