	<brief_summary>Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) frequent skin cancer . Uncontrolled growth destroy local anatomic structure . There various treatment alternative different recurrence rate expense . After surgical excision , recurrence rate 3 4 % procedure relatively expensive . Photodynamic therapy well imiquimod 5 % expensive therapy high recurrence rate , lack histologic evidence BCC . Cryosurgery curettage inexpensive , although recurrence rate higher surgical excision . This prospective , randomized trial compare recurrence rate , cosmetic outcome , surgery-related complication curettage versus surgical excision nodular superficial BCC . About 600 tumor include . One half treated curettage , half surgical excision . The follow-up period four year . If difference recurrence rate ≤7 % cosmetic outcome well surgery-related complication bad curettage , surgical excision must consider overtreatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . First presentation patient clinical histopathological diagnosis BCC 2 . Study patient number , first surname , date birth gender list distinct file . 3 . Informed consent 4 . Whole body screen skin cancer 5 . In- exclusion patient . If patient exclude , data obtain . 6 . Recording follow feature electronic file : 1 . Number BCCs 2 . Anatomic location - Lip - Eyelid - Ear - Nose - Other part face - Scalp neck - Trunk - Arm , hand , shoulder - Leg , foot , hip 3 . Position - Ventral dorsal . If tumor locate lateral margin ventral dorsal , consider ventral . - Right , leave , midline - Distinct BCCs number . To ensure future distinction different tumor , number start up-right-ventral tumor end down-left-dorsal one . Numbering continue BCCs appear later period recruitment . 4 . Diameter mm 7 . In- exclusion tumor 8 . Photographs include BCCs 9 . Randomization perform Department Biostatistics ( distance Department Dermatology = 1.7 km ) envelop contain assign study arm . The study physician call one four staff member Department Biostatistics ask randomization . The envelope open unless electronic data file complete study physician . 10 . Disinfection 11 . Local anesthesia 12 . Surgery 13 . Dressing 14 . If histopathology discover another BCC type nodular superficial even another tumor BCC , tumor exclude . 15 . Follow-up visit 3 6 month ( +/- 30 day ) operation . In BCCs operate &gt; 1 step , day follow-up visit refers initial operation . 16 . In case clinical suspicion recurrence BCC punch biopsy take . If biopsy confirms recurrence , endpoint achieve . 17 . If BCCs must add patient recruitment period , follow-up visit always refer late BCC . 18 . If patient visit department within define follow-up period , appointment record ( except confirmation recurrence ) . 19 . Patients provide feedback receive phone call . 20 . If patient private practitioner suspect recurrence BCC beyond defined follow-up period , course , patient invite early possible department , biopsy take . 21 . The patient receives letter contain list BCCs treat within study . The private practitioner visit list 12 , 24 , 36 month ( +/- 30 day ) refer last operation within recruitment period . The letter contain questionnaire scar size suspicion recurrence BCC . The practitioner patient return questionnaire answer department . If recurrence suspect take biopsy . 22 . When follow-up close individual patient , reason record : 1 . Planned end follow-up 48 month . 2 . Patient move . 3 . Death ( date death ) . 4 . Consent withdrawn . 5 . Patient become meanwhile ill high-maintenance follow-up visit plan . 6 . Recurrence patient 's BCCs . 23 . Statistic evaluation base intention-to-treat-analysis . 24 . The trial design prove equivalence treatment modality . A statistic test use evaluation , include Kaplan-Meier-method . When 4 study arm contain 116 BCCs , 2-group-test equivalence ratio 1-sided significance level 0.05 power 80 % disprove null hypothesis . The null hypothesis standard test method equivalent ( ratio difference delta T - delta S ≥ 0.15 ) . Then alternative hypothesis probable , mean ratio group equivalent suppose expect ratio difference 0.07 ratio within standard group 0.03 ( accord expect recurrence rate 3 % surgical excision study arm ) .</detailed_description>
