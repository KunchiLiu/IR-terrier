	<brief_summary>Objectives : - To determine safety , tolerability maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) oral temozolomide use 7 day 7 day regimen combine intrathecal liposomal cytarabine ( DepoCyt ) patient neoplastic meningitis solid tumor systemic lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DepoCyt Plus Temozolomide Patients With Neoplastic Meningitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liposomal cytarabine slow-release formulation cytarabine Ara-C . It design slowly release cytarabine increase exposure cancer cell drug treatment leptomeningeal disease . Temozolomide chemotherapy drug design attach DNA rapidly divide cell ( cancer cell ) . The cell recognize self-destruct . Tests call Indium-111 Technetium 99m-DPTA CSF flow study , radioactive dye inject CSF , do make sure CSF flow freely throughout spinal canal . These do part screen evaluation . If flow study okay , eligible take part study . But block CSF pathway , area may treat ( usually radiation ) re-evaluated may still enrol study repeat flow study show block clear . If ventriculoperitoneal ( VP ) ventriculoatrial ( VA ) shunt place , shunt closure test shunt system close monitor 4 hour development clinical sign increase intracranial pressure . The shunt closure test perform allow long enough time shunt close liposomal cytarabine inject . Researchers want make sure drug stay CSF system long enough perform function , without siphon shunt . An Ommaya Reservoir ( small round plastic pouch tube go brain CSF ) place scalp neurosurgeon start therapy already one place . The reservoir use deliver liposomal cytarabine collect sample CSF need . Liposomal cytarabine give Ommaya Reservoir every 14 day Day 1 total 12 week ( 6 treatment ) . This call Induction Treatment . After first 12 week , liposomal cytarabine give Day 1 every 28 day 40 week ( 10 treatment ) . This call Maintenance Treatment . If already take daily dexamethasone , begin take dexamethasone mouth twice day day depocyt start course continue 5 day administration liposomal cytarabine . Temozolomide take mouth day 7 day ( Days 1 - 7 ) every 14 day start second treatment liposomal cytarabine Day 14 . You take continuously throughout Induction Maintenance treatment liposomal cytarabine . Your doctor may prescribe anti-nausea medication take 1 hour take temozolomide . Your doctor choose appropriate anti-nausea medication time . You swallow temozolomide capsule ( usually 1 5 ) whole quickly one . You chew temozolomide capsule . If vomiting occurs course treatment , re-dosing do next schedule dose . You take temozolomide bedtime fast ( eat drink anything except water ) least 1 hour dose 1 hour dose . Three ( 3 ) participant time enrol Phase I portion study . The first group participant receive certain dose temozolomide . If dose tolerate , additional 3 treat dose . If 1 participant severe side effect , dose Phase II portion study . During Phase II portion , participant show ability tolerate first dose level , next dose may increase , decide treat physician next treatment timepoint . During study , blood sample ( 1 tablespoon ) routine test repeat every week Induction every 2 week Maintenance period . The Gd-MRI brain spine repeat Week 6 12 every 8 week . Within 72 hour liposomal cytarabine dosing , vital sign physical neurological exam do . CSF remove Ommaya Reservoir every 2 week lumbar puncture every 6 week Induction Ommaya Reservoir every 4 week lumbar puncture every 8 week Maintenance period look cancer cell fluid . Treatment continue unless disease get bad unacceptable side effect occur . Treatment give outpatient basis . At end study , vital sign , complete physical neurological exam , routine blood test ( 1 tablespoon ) perform . CSF sample cytology , protein , glucose , cell count take . The Gd-MRI scan repeat . You ask complete questionnaire feeling . After completion study , physical neurological exam vital sign CSF sample collect every 28 day 3 month every 3 month 1 year . If sign tumor get bad returning , Gd-MRI . This investigational study . Temozolomide approve FDA treatment brain tumor commercially available . Liposomal cytarabine authorize research use treatment brain tumor . The use two drug together experimental . About 180 patient take part study . About 18 enrol UT MD Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must &gt; /=18 year age 2 . All patient exception primary brain tumor , must histologic diagnosis systemic malignancy . Patients must presence malignant cell CSF ( +CSF ) clinical sign symptom leptomeningeal disease radiographic abnormality without malignant cell identify CSF ( CSF ) . Clinical signs/symptoms include cerebral hemispheric , cranial nerve , and/or spinal cord/root dysfunction . 3 . Patients must Karnofsky performance status &gt; /=60 % . Patients unable walk paralysis , wheelchair , consider ambulatory purpose performance score . 4 . Patients must recover acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy , enter study must without significant systemic illness . Patients must receive systemic therapy Leptomeningeal disease ( LMD ) within 3 wks ( 6 wks nitrosourea ) , intrathecal chemotherapy within 1 wk , irradiation within 8 wks prior treatment study . Patients previously receive craniospinal irradiation must positive cytology progression meningeal disease MRI scan . Patients must receive whole brain focal CNS radiotherapy within 1 wk treatment . 5 . Patients must platelet count &gt; /= 75,000/mm ( 3 ) ANC &gt; /= 1500/mm ( 3 ) within 72 hour prior intrathecal DepoCyt temozolomide treatment . 6 . Patients must adequate liver function , total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg % ; SGPT &lt; 5 time normal ; adequate renal function ( serum creatinine &lt; /= 1.5 mg ) ; normal metabolic parameter ( serum electrolytes , calcium , magnesium , phosphorus ) . 7 . All patient legal guardian must sign document inform consent indicate awareness investigational nature risk study . 8 . Ventricular access device ( e.g . Ommaya reservoir ) mandatory . 1 . Patients receive therapy ( either intrathecal systemic ) design specifically treat leptomeningeal disease eligible study . However , patient receive concomitant noncytotoxic therapy ( hormonal cytostatic therapy ) control systemic disease bulk CNS disease eligible , provide therapy phase I agent , agent significantly penetrate CSF agent know serious unpredictable CNS side effect . 2 . ( 1. continue ) No cytotoxic chemotherapy allow ( noncytotoxic therapy herceptin , tarceva , arimidex etc allow investigator 's discretion ) . Careful documentation concurrently administer systemic drug require . 3 . Patients clinical evidence obstructive hydrocephalus compartmentalization CSF flow document radioisotope Indium ( 111 ) ( Technetium ( 99 ) DTPA Indium ( 111 ) unavailable ) flow study eligible protocol . CSF obstruction determine routine nuclear medicine CSF flow study parameter . If patient evidence block subsequently proven relieved focal XRT , patient enroll immediately repeat flow study show block relieve . 4 . Patients ventriculoperitoneal ( VP ) ventriculoatrial ( VA ) shunt must on/off device shunt system eligible study . Patients must able tolerate shunt closure &gt; /= 4 hour without development clinical sign increase intracranial pressure . Patients unable tolerate shunt closure &gt; /= 4 hour eligible study . 5 . Women childbearing potential ( female surgically sterile period last 12 month ) must negative serum pregnancy test must lactate . 6 . Patients uncontrolled infection ( lifethreatening infection resistant treatment 7 day ) eligible study , except HIV AIDSrelated lymphomatous meningitis ) . 7 .
