	<criteria>The participant histologically cytologically confirm clear cell RCC The participant ≥ 18 year age The participant Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ( ECOG PS ) 01 Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥ 80 % The participant prior nephrectomy ( therapy RCC ) The participant metastatic RCC The participant life expectancy &gt; 3 month The participant measurable disease define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) The participant receive prior therapy TKI ( sunitinib and/or sorafenib ) either disease progression TKI therapy ( progression within 60 day last dose TKI ) intolerance TKI ( unable continue therapy sideeffects ) . A participant progression protract treatment break eligible unless participant progression intolerance define The participant resolution clinically significant toxic effect prior cancer therapy grade ≤ 1 National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events , version 3.0 ( NCICTCAE ) The participant adequate hematological function [ absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500 cell per milliliter ( cells/mL ) , hemoglobin ≥ 9 gram per deciliter ( g/dL ) platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mL ] The participant adequate hepatic function [ bilirubin within normal limit ( WNL ) , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) and/or alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , ≤ 5.0 time ULN transaminase elevation due liver metastasis ] The participant normal renal function mild renal dysfunction [ creatinine ≤ 2.2 milligram per deciliter ( mg/dL ) ] The participant 's urinary protein ≤ 1+ dipstick routine urinalysis [ ( UA ) ; urine dipstick routine analysis ≥ 2+ , 24hour urine protein must demonstrate &lt; 1000 ( milligram ) mg protein 24 hour allow participation study ] The participant must adequate coagulation function define International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) ≤ 1.8 partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) ≤ 1.5 X ULN . Participants fulldose anticoagulation must stable dose oral anticoagulant low molecular weight ( LMW ) heparin warfarin must INR 2 3 active bleed pathological condition carry high risk bleeding ( example , tumor involve major vessel know varix ) The participant able provide inform write consent The participant , sexually active , postmenopausal ( last menstrual period &gt; 2 year prior study ) , surgically sterile , use effective method contraception opinion investigator The participant , female , must negative serum pregnancy test upon entry study The participant normal thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) value . Participants abnormal TSH may eligible provided meet eligibility criterion ECOG performance status 01 . Participants abnormal TSH value require full thyroid evaluation prior enrollment . Endocrinology consultation may perform discretion investigator The participant serum calcium within normal limit The participant receive prior treatment bevacizumab The participant know brain leptomeningeal metastases The participant receive &gt; 2 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens RCC The participant receive antitumor therapy ( biologic agent , major surgery , investigational agent ) within 28 day prior enrollment study . The participant receive radiation therapy within 14 day prior enrollment study . Participants metastasis weight bear bone high risk pathologic fracture may participate provided appropriate surgical intervention and/or radiation therapy undertaken complete least 28 day prior enrollment The participant receive &gt; 1 prior bioimmunotherapy regimen ( define either interleukin2 interferon alpha give monotherapy , concurrently , sequentially plan ) The participant concurrent active malignancy adequately treat nonmelanomatous skin cancer noninvasive carcinoma situ neoplasm . A participant previous history malignancy eligible , provide he/she disease free &gt; 3 year The participant nonhealing wound ulcer The participant know alcohol drug dependency The participant pregnant breastfeed The participant coexist medical psychiatric problem sufficient severity limit compliance study and/or increase risk associate study participation study drug administration interfere interpretation study result The participant ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic poorly control cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation , serious uncontrolled medical disorder opinion investigator The participant know human immunodeficiency virus infection acquire immunodeficiency syndromerelated illness</criteria>
