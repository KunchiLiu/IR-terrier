	<brief_summary>Raltegravir ( MK-0518 ) HIV-1 integrase inhibitor potent vitro activity HIV-1 strain include resistant currently available antiretroviral drug . The purpose study assess effectiveness raltegravir reduce viral load HIV infect patient already achieve viral suppression level detection standard viral load assay added antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Addition Raltegravir ( MK-0518 ) PI- NNRTI-Based ART Regimens HIV Infected Subjects With Undetectable Viral Load</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although ART reduce morbidity mortality HIV-1 infection , individual stop ART experience rapid viral rebound . Effective ART suppress viral load le 50 copies/ml ; however , current treatment regimens completely eliminate infection . The primary purpose study assess ability HIV-1 integrase inhibitor , raltegravir , reduce viral load add ART regimens HIV-1 infected patient achieve viral suppression le 50 copies/ml . The study last 24 week . Participants randomly assign one two arm . Participants Arm A administered raltegravir addition usual ART regimen study entry Week 12 . At Week 12 , subject halt raltegravir use receive placebo Week 24 . Participants Arm B administer placebo addition usual ART regimen study entry Week 12 . At Week 12 , subject halt placebo receive raltegravir Week 24 . A real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) single copy assay ( SCA ) capable detect 1 copy HIV RNA use assay viral load . The cross-over design allow assessment effect intensification raltegravir two arm Weeks 10/12 every participant enrol study receive raltegravir 12 week . Primary analysis focus week 10/12 measurement washout period , typical analysis cross-over design intend . All participant schedule visit Weeks 0 , 2 , 4 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 22 , 24 . A targeted physical exam occur visit . Blood urine collection occur select visit . A medical/medication assessment occur trial entry . Drug dispense adherence questionnaire occur visit . A pregnancy test occur select visit . Participants ' background ART medication provide study .</detailed_description>
