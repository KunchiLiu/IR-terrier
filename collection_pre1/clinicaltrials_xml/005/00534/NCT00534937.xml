	<brief_summary>The researcher hypothesize utilization Flexitouch system improve heal rate ( venous stasis ulcer ) VSU compare traditional compression wrap therapy alone . Primary Objective : The primary study objective determine whether complete heal rate venous stasis ulcer 12 week improve addition Flexitouch® System compression therapy standard regimen compression wrapping . Secondary Objectives : - To determine whether addition Flexitouch System compression therapy standard regimen compression wrap increase percentage reduction wound surface area . - To determine whether addition Flexitouch compression therapy standard regimen compression wrap increase percentage reduction volume affect limb . - To determine whether addition Flexitouch compression therapy standard regimen compression wrap decrease time heal venous stasis ulcer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Overview venous stasis ulcer ( 1-3 ) : Venous stasis ulceration common complication venous insufficiency United States . Venous stasis ulcer ( VSU ) associate significant morbidity , include patient disability , moderate severe pain , frequent leg infection . There also large cost associate medical care need condition inability patient work . In patient , condition life- limb-threatening . Current standard care VSU : It widely accept VSU treat individualized program compression wrap therapy ( 3-5 ) . This therapy design counteract presume pathophysiology VSU , develop result valvular reflux venous hypertension . However , efficacy compression therapy alone suboptimal , heal rate roughly 34 % report 12 week therapy ( 6 ) . Various adjunctive treatment study , include artificial skin graft ( 6-8 ) . However , none adjunctive modality become widely accepted treatment VSU . Potential role compression pump : Intermittent sequential compression pump widely use adjunctive modality treatment VSU . These pump use high compression expensive , expense may outweigh improved healing VSU . The use compression pump consistent pathophysiology VSU , data regard efficacy therapy scarce . To date , study adequately assess efficacy compression pump therapy treatment VSU ( 9 ) . Flexitouch System : The Flexitouch System design therapist train manual lymphatic drainage therapy produce Tactile Systems Technology , Inc . The Flexitouch System design simulate MLD technique intend home use self-management phase CDT . MLD one ( four ) component ( ) Complete Decongestive Therapy , consider `` Gold Standard '' treatment lymphedema . MLD gentle , manual technique produce light directional pressure/stretch skin manipulation healthy lymph node vessel . The effect properly apply MLD include increased intake lymphatic load lymphatic system , increased lymphangiomotoricity , increase volume transport lymph fluid , increase venous return superficial venous system , promotion parasympathetic response pain control . Treatment always initiate trunk segment , decongestion proximal area , prior address involve extremity ( clear central area promote decongestion distal area ) . The extremity treat segment , start proximal segment progress distal proximal region . The Flexitouch® System intend replace intensive phase CDT . However , follow principle MLD many way . Flexitouch system provide limb treatment , addition , address trunk congestion . The low extremity garment set consist two garment , one garment fit affect low extremity fit low abdomen/trunk . Each garment make multiple inflatable chamber within flexible , stretchable fabric . The treatment consist 2-phase program . As MLD , preparation phase begin treatment start inguinal quadrant . Each curve trunk chamber inflates deflate sequentially facilitate movement edema fluid systemic circulation . The cycle repeat several time . The inflation/deflation cycle repeat limb region knee groin , ankle knee , finally toe ankle . The second phase , drainage , begin sequential inflation/deflation cycle toe continue move leg quadrant trunk facilitate movement edema fluid inguinal quadrant system circulation . Choice compression pump device study VSU treatment : A variety inflatable compression pump available , data help choose among device ( 9 ) . No compression device accept standard care VSU . Flexitouch system differs standard ( intermittent sequential ) compression pump significant way . As described , Flexitouch system unique compression device , provide sequential limb compression , also trunk compression . Flexitouch system 's two-phase program ( preparation drainage ) also make different compression device . The fact system create lymphedema may advantage treatment VSU , many author ( 10 ; 11 ) believe secondary lymphedema play important role among VSU patient . Study Outline : Patient enrollment procedure - An approved consent form authorization permit release personal health information must sign patient guardian . - All eligibility requirement indicate Section 3.0 must satisfy . - The patient must register call study coordinator Lisa Rudman , Allegheny General Hospital ( 412-359-4325 ) . General treatment plan : After enrollment , patient see per week 12-week period standard compression wrapping . At visit , treatment assessment undertaken described . The Flexitouch group use Flexitouch System home ( daily ) in-clinic ( per week ) . Essential element treatment assessment : Applicable ALL patient - The patient see wound center one ( 1 ) time per week 12 week . - Patients receive compression wrap standard care therapy . The precise amount compression individualize accord patient tolerance use 3M Coban 2 layer Compression System . - The wound area measure photographed weekly , use wound trace planimetry software . - The limb volume measure weekly , use available software ( NetHealth , Pittsburgh PA ) . - The presence absence wound infection assess . The need wind debridement record . - The wound score whether heal . If wound heal previous visit , presence recurrent ulceration assess . - The occurrence treatment failure record ( see section 7d ) . - Comprehensive standard wound care treatment include gentle wound cleanse saline solution visit , maintain moisture balance wound periwound appropriate dressing ( alginate , foam , hydrogel hydrocolloid ) , remind subject importance proper nutrition , leg elevation rest activity , include frequent ambulation ankle ROM exercise day . Additional step applicable patient randomize Flexitouch arm : - Patients provide home Flexitouch unit . They give instruction use Flexitouch system daily basis . They need remove compression wrap home therapy . - In addition home use , clinic visit , patient 's trunk affect limb treat 60 minute Flexitouch system . - The patient ask indicate level comfort in-clinic Flexitouch session ( scale 0 5 ; 0 = comfortable , 5 = uncomfortable ) .</detailed_description>
