	<brief_summary>The exact etiology ischemic stroke remain unclear , multiple genetic predisposition environmental risk factor may involve , interaction dictate complexity . Family-based study provide unique feature design robustness population admixture stratification . The Fangshan / Family-based Ischemic Stroke Study In China ( FISSIC ) program aim conduct genetic pedigree study ischemic stroke rural community China .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fangshan / Family-based Ischemic Stroke Study In China</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The FISSIC program community-based hospital-centered genetic epidemiological study ischemic stroke . The study design two component : first , family-based study ischemic stroke pedigree , include probands , sibling , parent ; second , traditional match case-control study ischemic stroke case unaffected spouse . Cases confirm ischemic stroke include probands ; inform consent obtain , parent , sibling , unaffected spouse recruit screened use proband-initiated contact method . Stroke status verify central hospital , index stroke case subtyped medical record . Baseline clinical demographic data collect questionnaire , longitudinal follow-up visit schedule . Blood sample collect enrolled participant three-tier prevention health care network ( village , township county level ) study area . The sample send central laboratory processing , test , genotyping . The genotype data merge clinical , environmental , follow-up data analysis . Comprehensive statistical method apply family-based case-control data ascertain potential complex genetic environmental factor interaction .</detailed_description>
