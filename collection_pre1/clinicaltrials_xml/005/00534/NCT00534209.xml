	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Finished First-Line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To establish safety B7 vaccine use within 4 week complete first line platinum base chemotherapy . ( Phase I ) - To determine whether patient advance non-small cell lung cancer ( stage IIIB/IV ) achieve clinical response ( stable disease , partial response , complete response ) first-line platinum-based chemotherapy increase time disease progression result vaccination allogeneic B7.1 HLA-A1 transfected tumor-cell vaccine . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To evaluate immune response ( CD8 ) B7-vaccinated patient compare control . ( Phase II ) - To evaluate relationship CD8 response B7-vaccinated patient progression-free survival . ( Phase II ) - To evaluate safety profile B7 vaccine . ( Phase II ) - To evaluate response rate second-line chemotherapy ( disease progression ) B7-vaccinated patient compare control . ( Phase II ) - To evaluate overall survival patient immunized B7 vaccine compare control . ( Phase II ) - To evaluate correlative immunological study . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Phase I ( single site [ University Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center ] ) : Patients receive allogeneic B7.1 HLA-A1 transfected tumor cell vaccine intradermally ( ID ) week 1 , 3 , 5 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 2 course . If 1 6 patient experience probable definitively treatment related adverse effect ( i.e. , grade 2 autoimmune grade 3-4 type ) , patient proceed phase II portion study . If 2 ( 6 ) patient experience treatment related adverse effect study stop . - Phase II ( randomize ) : Patients stratify accord study site ( University Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center Memorial Regional Hospital ) , type prior first-line treatment ( platinum taxane v platinum gemcitabine ) , presence brain metastasis ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive allogeneic B7.1 HLA-A1 transfected tumor cell vaccine ID week 1 , 3 , 5 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 2 course . - Arm II : Patients receive placebo vaccine arm I . Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically correlative study . Samples analyze CD8 , CD4 , NK response PBL TH1/TH2 bias , include level IL-1β , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , IL-13 , IFN-γ , TNF-α via ELISA . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 4 year , year thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 66 patient ( 6 patient phase I 60 patient phase II ) accrue study .</detailed_description>
