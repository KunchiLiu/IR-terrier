As part routine prenatal care , woman receive one hour glucose challenge test screen gestational diabetes . Those woman elevate value require three hour glucose tolerance test , diagnostic test gestational diabetes . All woman schedule receive three hour GTT identify ask enroll study . 46 woman whose three hour GTT normal thus GDM , compare 46 woman abnormal three hour GTT thus would diagnosis GDM . Enrolled woman lipid panel consist ; total cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL LDL cholesterol time fast glucose blood sample . In addition , repeat lipid panel send time third hour sample , ass change , due glucose challenge . Umbilical cord blood sample send order obtain newborn lipid profile . Women GDM normal group ask return 6-8 week</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose pilot study determine , pregnancy , woman GDM exaggerate lipid response compare non-gestational diabetic . If difference note , study explore possibility screen gestational diabetic pregnancy hyperlipidemia determine prenatal screen predict postpartum risk hyperlipidemia . In addition relationship , maternal lipid dysfunction placental disease explore . Subsequent study could also explore possible perinatal complication associate elevated lipid metabolic syndrome . C. Experimental Design , Methodology Expected Results Study Design : We propose prospective cohort design . Study Population : All woman schedule receive three hour GTT rule gestational diabetes would identify ask enroll study . Specifically , eligible patient woman fail glucose challenge test ( GCT ) schedule follow-up three hour glucose tolerance test ( GTT ) . The GCT routinely perform among prenatal care patient 24-28 wks gestation . The 3 hour GTT require patient fast overnight . A fasting blood glucose sample , patient give 100 gram glucose drink . Serum glucose sample take one , two three hour glucose load . The `` exposed '' group define woman diagnose GDM ( elevate glucose value two sample three hour GTT ) . The `` unexposed '' group define woman abnormal glucose value three hour GTT .</detailed_description>
