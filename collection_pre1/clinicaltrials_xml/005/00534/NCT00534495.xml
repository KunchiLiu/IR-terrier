	<detailed_description>The current standard treatment SJIA include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) corticosteroid . However , people , NSAIDS completely control disease . Also , study do prove medication combination medication best treat child adolescent SJIA . Interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , protein secrete certain cell body , assist regulate immune inflammatory response . Too much IL-1 harmful show play role inflammation associate variety disease , include SJIA . Rilonacept drug inhibit IL-1 activity . The purpose study determine whether rilonacept drug regimen initiate early effective similar rilonacept drug regimen initiate 4 week later treat child young adult SJIA . This study also evaluate safety rilonacept , various tissue sample collect participant future genetic study . This study last 6 month . Participants randomly assign one two group : - Group 1 participant receive rilonacept injection dose 4.4mg/kg study entry ( load dose ) , 2.2 mg/kg weekly Week 4 . At Week 4 , receive load dose placebo , follow weekly rilonacept injection 2.2 mg/kg duration study . - Group 2 participant receive placebo study entry first 4 week treatment . At Week 4 , receive load dose rilonacept injection 4.4 mg/kg , follow weekly rilonacept injection dose 2.2 mg/kg duration study . Participants continue previous corticosteroid therapy , taper dos . All participant attend study visit Weeks 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 24 . Study visit include physical exam , joint exam , blood collection , interview , questionnaire .
