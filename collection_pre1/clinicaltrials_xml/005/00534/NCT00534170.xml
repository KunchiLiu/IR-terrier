Randomization do ratio 1:1 , i.e. , study arm control arm include 2000 child . All child study visit daily health worker supervise intake Probiotic drink Nutrient drink child . All child follow daily 24weeks identification acute diarrhoea case . METHODOLOGY Slum area Kolkata Municipal Corporation approximately 60,000 population ( approximate 15,000 family ) select ward 66 reach sample size minimum 4,000 child ( 1-5 year age ) . Baseline anthropometric measurement take . The diarrhoeal surveillance regular household visit CHW stool container keep child 's house collect stool sample diarrhoea occur . INCLUSION/ EXCLUSION CRITERION FOR RECRUITMENT OF PARTICIPANTS Children either sex age 1-5 year eligible screen parent give write , informed consent form ( Appendix 7 ) require either parents/ guardian participate child . Participating child free chronic illness also recent illness may compromise immune system . In general good health without know underlying illness .

There 20 Community Health Workers ( CHW ) , allocate health outpost responsible administer one agent code 40 child . SAFETY EVALUATION Clinical monitor evaluate adverse event due intake drink . DATA MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES Data obtain demographic survey ( Appendix 4 ) , daily report proforma enter PC use suitable software . Data scrutinize accuracy consistency enter PC . Data enter computer dedicate area locate NICED , use data entry program specially create project programmer . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Endpoints Efficacy assess compare follow probiotic nutrient group : ) Average duration diarrhoea ii ) Severity disease iii ) Incidence diarrhoeal disease iv ) Nutritional gain v ) Analysis fecal microflora ETHICAL ASSURANCE FOR PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS Written inform consent obtain parent/guardian participate child Probiotic Nutrition study safety permission collect feces . The probiotic nutritional drink safe administer infant child , adult elderly . Storage condition The probiotic nutrient store 4 10ï‚°C . Bottles take field carry carry bag . Each box single ice pack , care take freeze content bottle . MONITORING , AUDITING , INSPECTION Responsibilities investigator ( ) The principal co-investigators NICED responsible overall supervision management project . Field investigator co-investigators support PI . The PI co-investigators supervise activity health facility sit ( demographic surveillance , data collection , sample collection transportation ) . They also visit study site regularly . ETHICAL AND REGULATORY STANDARDS Ethical principle The justification use nutrient study : 1 ) probiotic currently recommend use prevention diarrhoeal diseases public health program India 2 ) valid assessment probiotic efficacy Kolkata , endemic diarrhoea , obtain use nutrient . The nutrient consist nutrient without lactobacillus , help nutritional growth child . Potential benefit During phase project , potential benefit participant include proper treatment referral need , well free accurate diagnosis causative agent diarrhoeal disease . During trial phase , probiotic recipient expect benefit protection offer probiotic diarrhoea . Potential risk The potential risk participant minimal , since extensive documentation safety probiotic use . Risk/benefit ratio The direct benefit participant may expect participate study free laboratory examination treatment diarrhoea disease . The main benefit obtain data efficacy probiotic Kolkata data crucial guide decision Indian , perhaps develop country government whether probiotic alternative approach growth child well prevention diarrhoeal disease . All recipient probiotic potentially benefit probable protective effect diarrhoea . The risk associate use probiotic nutrient various study procedure propose use trial expect minimal nonexistent . Laws regulation The study perform accordance principle govern biomedical research involve human subject , specifically ICMR Ethical Guidelines , Declaration Helsinki , International Conference Harmonization 's Good Clinical Practice Guidelines provide assurance right , integrity , confidentiality trial subject protect report result credible accurate .
