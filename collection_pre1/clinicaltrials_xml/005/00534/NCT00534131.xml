	<brief_summary>Anal sphincter preserve operation commonplace cancer non-cancerous rectal disease . However , always case development facilitate invention circular stapling instrument , allow bowel reconnected anal sphincter , would almost impossible manually . Nevertheless , patient still require permanent ostomy , even staple device ultra low join bowel sphincter muscle always perform conventional surgery . Therefore , variety alternative technique propose avoid permanent ostomy , become widespread due technical difficulty performing , failure completely eradicate rectal disease , damage inflict upon anal sphincter result poor bowel function surgery . The ideal ultra low sphincter preserve operation remove rectal disease entirely , allow small large bowel safely join anal sphincter direct vision , retain sphincter mechanism entirety . We propose technique term APPEAR procedure , approach low third rectum via incision scrotum vagina , anal sphincter . This procedure preserve sphincter integrity , allow either staple manual join bowel sphincter mechanism , direct vision . This trial conduct pilot study , procedure offer patient conventional sphincter save procedure technically impossible , contraindicate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anterior Perineal Plane Ultra Low Anterior Resection Rectum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study recruit patient distal third rectal pathology , conventional sphincter save procedure contraindicate , likely technically impossible . Recruited patient initially undergo trial dissection conventional sphincter preserve surgical technique , successful result patient enter study arm 1 . However , possible , trial anterior perineal dissection attempt , patient enter study arm 2 perineal dissection adequate allow full rectal excision , preserve sphincter integrity . If trial anterior perineal dissection decide sphincter preservation safe , allow eradication rectal disease , conventional proctectomy perform , patient enter study arm 3 .</detailed_description>
