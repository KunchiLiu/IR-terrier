	<brief_summary>Ischemic injury muscular tissue common cardiovascular medicine . The effective treatment avoid ischemic damage rapid re-establishment reperfusion . However , reperfusion result additional damage ischemic tissue . This phenomenon call ischemia - reperfusion ( IR ) injury cause different pathologic mechanism . Therapies require administered onset ischemic event protect tissue IR injury . Therefore , promise strategy reduce IR injury post-conditioning . Likewise , pharmacological therapy administer onset reperfusion might prevent tissue injury . We recently show high concentration exogenous vitamin C abrogate experimental IR injury forearm vasculature patient peripheral artery disease healthy subject . Study hypothesis We hypothesize administration mechanical post-conditioning high-dose vitamin C may protect skeletal muscle IR injury . This shall study employ MR spectroscopy leg , establish model ass muscle aerobic energy metabolism . Design Three period , three way cross study 10 volunteer . One screen visit , three one-day study day two washout period &gt; 3 day schedule participant . The order experimental day randomize . After last treatment final follow-up examination perform within one week .</brief_summary>
