	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine series BNP blood test perform patient present Emergency Department congestive heart failure ( CHF ) predict patient may adverse outcome . If BNP show predictive bad outcome certain patient , patient might receive intensive therapy early prevent outcomes . This prospective trial enrol patient present ED diagnose heart failure . Subjects blood test BNP , elevate presence heart failure , collect twelve hour initial clinical BNP obtain ED . Demographics , history , length hospital stay , approve data collect . At 30 day 6 month discharge , follow call make determine subject require additional emergency care , admit hospital , die period time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Utility Serial BNP Levels Emergency Department CHF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BNP 32-amino acid peptide secrete almost exclusively ventricle condition ventricular wall strain.Multiple study examine utility BNP marker decompensated heart failure , inpatient outpatient setting . Several study examine use single BNP measure predict adverse outcome CHF patient . Typical study design utilized CHF specialty clinic patient admit congestive heart failure ( CHF ) exacerbation study population . Very study utilize BNP acute care set ; study also use BNP single measure . As serum half-life BNP approximately 22 minute , BNP level respond measure decrease ventricular wall strain , decrease BNP level diagnostic improve CHF . It hypothesis Emergency Department patient acute CHF exacerbation decrease serum BNP level 12 hour therapy demonstrate improve outcome compare patient whose BNP decrease . Our goal establish utility serial BNP level intensive initial management acute CHF . One six month follow-up patient outcome collect compare serial BNP measurement patient acute phase treatment . It hypothesis serial brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) level compare 0 12 hour research purpose predictive combine endpoint death , readmission , repeat Emergency Department visit recurrent CHF patient present Emergency Department acute exacerbation CHF . To date , data publish regard utility serial BNP measurement observation unit management CHF . Our study propose compare outcome patient manage Clinical Decision Unit ( CDU ) , six bed observation unit Emergency Department , patient admit CHF exacerbation . The primary outcome study combine endpoint death , readmission , repeat Emergency Department visit recurrent CHF 30 day 6 month . For inpatient , patient admit CDU inpatient service , additional outcome measure adverse outcome ( intubation , balloon pump , death , etc ) index hospitalization . As clinician manage patient access 12 hour BNP level , measurement BNP source bias . Our secondary hypothesis occurrence combine endpoint independent treatment location ( CDU v inpatient ) oppose responder vs. non-responder status .</detailed_description>
