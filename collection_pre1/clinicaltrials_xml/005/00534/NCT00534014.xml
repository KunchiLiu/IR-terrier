	<brief_summary>Study Goal # 1 : Determine optimal oral dose vitamin C reduce surrogate marker atherosclerosis ( blockage blood vessel ) follow consumption atherogenic high fat lunch type 2 diabetic individual . Study Goal # 2 : After conduct original study , find vitamin E effective reduce marker oxidative stress , hypercoagulation , inflammation , metabolic parameter patient type 2 diabetes . To date , data randomize trial largely demonstrate significant benefit vitamin E supplementation prevention primary and/or secondary cardiovascular disease thought . Therefore , decide amend current protocol add Part B study effect vitamin C follow dos : 500 mg , 1000 mg , 2000 mg daily ( include placebo arm , well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>More 70 % type 2 diabetic individual die atherosclerotic disease ( 1 ) . This partially explain abnormal lipid profile frequently observe type 2 diabetes . These patient also frequently afflict `` Syndrome X , '' assortment risk factor atherosclerosis , include hypertension , abdominal obesity , hyperuricemia , prothrombotic proinflammatory state , increase plasminogen activator inhibitor type I ( PAI-1 ) ( 2 ) . Several approach suggest reduce risk atherosclerosis type 2 diabetic individual . Changes lifestyle lead increased exercise weight loss result reduction adipose store ( restore tissue sensitivity insulin ) . However , approach difficult many individual achieve . For , supplement medication aspirin , angiotensin inhibitor , angiotensin receptor blocker , statin . Unfortunately , medication either expensive and/or include undesirable side effect ( 3 ) . In addition , clinical experience show many patient take medication cultural reason and/or fear long-term unknown consequence . For reason , great interest use vitamin reduce atherogenic risk . More half U.S. adult population consumes vitamins regular basis . They inexpensive easily accessible grocery store health food store . The FDA consider `` drug '' undergo less rigorous approval procedure ( 4,5 ) . Vitamins natural compound find body , many individual consider drug , feel simply fortify body disease . There currently focus vitamin antioxidant , include vitamin C. Patients diabetes usually decrease antioxidant status , lead increase oxidative stress vascular dysfunction ( 6,7 ) . Oxidative stress refers excessive production oxygen free radical specie , damage surround molecule , lead increased release inflammatory mediator , oxidation low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , increase coagulation ( 7 ) . Vitamin C , another antioxidant , show regenerate Vitamin E , patient increase oxidative stress ( i.e . patient condition diabetes mellitus , coronary artery disease , hypercholesterolemia ) , restore endothelium-dependent artery vasodilation , may reverse endothelial dysfunction peripheral artery ( 6 ) . It hypothesize supplementation vitamin C may effective vitamin take together . The hypothesis atherosclerosis may prevent block oxidative metabolism LDL cholesterol , hence decrease uptake arterial lumen , incited interest vitamin C treat coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . Basic science animal study show beneficial effect vitamin C several different stage atherosclerotic process . This follow several observational study patient initial coronary artery disease , suggest vitamin C lower risk future CHD . However , follow several large randomize control trial , majority show benefit vitamin C prevention CHD patient least one coronary risk factor . However , answer question whether vitamin C beneficial differeing dos . In 2002 , Fang et al . publish study investigate efficacy vitamin C E prevention transplant-associated arteriosclerosis ( another highly oxidative state ) . The primary outcome change average intimal index ( plaque area divide vessel area ) , measure intavascular ultrasonography ( IVUS ) . The vitamin C E plasma concentration measure baseline 1-year follow-up . At follow-up placebo group show significant increase treatment group show change . The author conclude early progression transplant-associated coronary arteriosclerosis delay combine vitamin C E therapy ( 6,10 ) . In 2003 , Salonen et al . publish six-year effect combine vitamin C E ASAP ( Antioxidant Supplementation Atherosclerosis Prevention ) study , study effect supplement dos progression common carotid atherosclerosis middle-aged high-risk men woman , use high-resolution ultrasound assess outcome . The group receive combine vitamin show decrease rate progression carotid intimal thickness , effect limit men ( 8,10 ) . In Heart Protection Study ( 2002 ) , combination synthetic vitamin E , vitamin C , beta-carotene daily effect incidence cardiovascular event group approximately 20,000 high-risk individual ( 10 ) . Therefore , study show positive benefit . Vitamin C show reduce overall oxidative stress scavenge free readicals within body ( 11 ) . Some trial fail report antioxidant level , make compliance difficult measure ( 8 ) ( except pill count - unfortunately , volunteer dispose medication prior visit , order give image compliance ) . Some trial use suboptimal time regard administration antioxidant vitamins relation meal ( 1 ) . Also , know exactly optimal dosage vitamin C . The dos vitamin C differ trial ( 8 ) ; investigator hypothesize least 500 mg/day vitamin C effective slow progression atherosclerosis , speculation rampant ( 7,8 ) . Based data study ( 1,7,8 ) , believe sufficient dos vitamin C effective slow progression atherosclerosis . It goal find optimal dose combination . We use high-risk population ( diabetic volunteer ) know high oxidative stress may benefit tremendously therapy .</detailed_description>
