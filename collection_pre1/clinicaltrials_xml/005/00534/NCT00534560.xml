	<brief_title>Dose Ranging Study Efficacy Tolerability Tonabersat Prophylaxis Migraine Headache</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multi-centre , double-blind , placebo control , randomize , parallel group , dose range study investigate efficacy tolerability two different target dos tonabersat placebo prophylaxis migraine . Following initial screen patient enter 4 week baseline assessment period , prior randomization one three treatment group . Subsequently patient allocate , accord predetermine randomization schedule , treatment placebo target dose tonabersat 40 mg/day 80 mg/day 20 week treatment period . A dose titration regimen employ period 4 week treatment maintain 16 week . During baseline assessment period treatment period patient maintain daily record ( diary data ) occurrence migraine headache , severity attack , presence/absence precede aura , symptom associate migraine detail use rescue medication ( patient permit use usual symptomatic/acute treatment rescue medication throughout trial ) . Patients attend clinic assessment collection blood urine sample laboratory analysis , sub-population patient participate pharmacokinetic study . A total 7 visit plan randomized double-blind treatment period . On completion randomize double-blind treatment period patient offer opportunity enter open label extension study patient receive tonabersat . A dose titration regimen employ period 1 month final assign dose tonabersat ( 40 , 60 80 mg/day ) continue next 12 month . During open label extension patient attend clinic regular assessment migraine status safety . A total 5 visit plan .</detailed_description>
