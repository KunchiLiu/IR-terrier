	<detailed_description>Evaluate long term safety effectiveness X-Stop interspinous process decompression system In patient receive X-Stop IDE . These patient consist two cohort evaluate : patient moderately impaired physical function prior X-Stop implantation ( determined baseline score &gt; 2.0 physical function ( PF ) domain Zurich claudication questionnaire ) , patient mildly impaired physical function prior X-Stop surgery ( determine baseline score &lt; =2.0 PF domain Zurich claudication questionnaire ( ZCQ ) , fifth postoperative year . Clinical examination perform office visit confirm absence neurological complication . X-ray film ( AP/lateral view ) take fifth postoperative year , analyze confirm A ) maintenance distraction B ) absence radiological evidence device-related complication . Secondary endpoint include mean score SF-36 , incidence rate adverse event , device failure , secondary surgery .</detailed_description>
