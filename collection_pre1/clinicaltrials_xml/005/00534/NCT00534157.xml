	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine pressure eye severely head-injured person correlate pressure person 's skull . This prospective study patient age 18 old experience traumatic close head injury intubate either time Emergency Department ( ED ) . Identified patient eye pressure measurement perform trauma bay OSU ED physician involve care . Information hospital stay , include first brain pressure measurement measure device use , collect . In addition , outcome hospital stay record .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Eye Pressure Predictor Intracranial Pressure Acutely Head-Injured Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) lead cause morbidity mortality United States , estimate 1.5 million American sustain TBI 50,000 people die TBI year . While immediate , primary , injury cause significant damage , secondary injury cause cerebral edema , increase intracranial pressure , resultant hypoperfusion ischemia . Elevated intracranial pressure strongly associate poor recovery death ; failure control intracranial pressure likewise associate poor outcome mortality . Early detection elevate ICP allow initiation early therapy . However , patient significant head injury often intubate airway protection . The sedation require intubation obscure ED neurologic exam . Precise measurement elevate ICP require invasive monitoring via ventriculostomy . Yet method provide set institution neurosurgical service . Further distinct time delay trauma occurrence , transportation facility neurosurgical service placement ventriculostomies . There forefront , , establish non-invasive measure ICP time efficient reliable . Previous study , include pilot study conduct institution , show correlation intraocular intracranial pressure . However , relationship test acute care trauma set . We propose observational cohort study critically injured trauma patient suspect closed head injury . Patients require intubation mechanical ventilation pose significant challenge ass neurologically , almost always sedate often chemically paralyzed facilitate airway management . Therefore , population intubate trauma patient suspect head injury evaluate use tonometry predict intracranial pressure intraocular pressure .</detailed_description>
