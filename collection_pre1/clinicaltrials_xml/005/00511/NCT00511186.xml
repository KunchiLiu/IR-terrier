	<detailed_description>RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY A previous clinical study conduct center The Netherlands Belgium show substantial clinical benefit AP treatment patient sepsis associate acute renal failure ( see Introduction ) . The latter result require confirmation prospective study , current subject Protocol . Choice Drugs The propose study medication ( AP ) identical study medication use previous clinical study sepsis patient single multiple end-organ failure . Since current proven treatment patient , control ( previous study ) placebo . Choice patient population The aim enroll maximum 26 patient positive sepsis APACHE score ≥20 ≤28 ( determine within 24 hour entry ) , analyzed intention treat ( ITT ) basis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients age 18 80 year . Proven suspected infection . Two four SIRS criterion systemic inflammation , exist less 24 hour admission intensive care unit , follow : Core temperature high 38 degree Celsius low 36 degree Celsius . Heart rate 90 beats/min ( unless patient medical condition know increase heart rate receiving treatment would prevent tachycardia ) . Respiratory rate 20 breaths/min , PaCO2 low 32mmHg use mechanical ventilation acute respiratory process . Whitecell count 12,000/mm3 4,000/mm3 differential count show &gt; 10 percent immature neutrophil . Acute renal failure , define Rise serum creatinine level ≥150μmol/L within previous 48 hour , absence primary underlying renal disease OR Minimally stage 1 Kidney Injury accord AKIN creatinine criterion : Increase serum creatinine ≥26.2µmol/L ( 0.3mg/dL ) increase ≥150 % ( ≥1.5 fold ) baseline previous 48 hour absence primary underlying renal disease baseline creatinine le 150 µmol/L ) OR Minimally stage 1 Kidney Injury accord AKIN Urine Output criterion : Urine Output ≤ 0.5mg/kg/h ≥6h follow adequate fluid resuscitation applicable , absence underlying primary renal disease baseline creatinine le 150µmol/L ) Written informed consent obtain prior study intervention . Pregnant woman nurse mother fecund female effective contraception ( chemical : pill ; mechanical : IUD ) Patients already dialysis ( RTT ) entry Known HIV ( seropositive ) patient Patients receive immunosuppressant therapy chronic high dos steroids equivalent prednisone 1mg/Kg/day Patients expect rapidly fatal disease within 24 hour Known confirm grampositive sepsis Known confirm fungal sepsis Acute pancreatitis establish source infection Patients expect survive 28 day due medical condition endstage neoplasm disease Participation another investigational study within 90 day prior start study might interfere study Any previous administration active study medication . Known allergy dairy ( bovine ) product include cow milk . Sepsis without renal failure define Entry Criteria . History chronic renal failure history persistent creatinine level equal great 150umol/L prior entry reason current sepsis condition '' .</criteria>
