	<brief_title>Doxercalciferol Recurrent Pediatric Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Doxercalciferol design `` copy action '' Vitamin D without cause blood level calcium high . Study Drug Dose Level : If find eligible take part study , begin receive doxercalciferol . The dose receive base many participant enrol , safety data available . You remain dose level throughout study . There 9 participant enrol group dose . The first group participant enrol study give small dos doxercalciferol . If intolerable side effect experience , next group participant enrol high dose level . This process continue researcher find high tolerable dose doxercalciferol , among 5 dose level test , give without intolerable side effect occur . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , begin first `` cycle '' study drug . Each cycle chemotherapy last 28 day . Doxercalciferol take mouth every day 28 day . Study Visits : Every week Cycle 1 , physical exam , urine collect routine test . Two ( 2 ) time every week study , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . During Cycles 2 beyond , follow test procedure perform : - Urine collect routine test . - ECG ECHO repeat doctor feel necessary . - You may also compute tomography ( CT ) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) check status disease . Length Study : You may remain study 12 cycles.You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . The study doctor may stop take part study time he/she believe best interest follow study rule . You stop participate study time . Tell study doctor think leave study risk review study doctor follow-up care test discuss . The study doctor tell stop safely . End-of-Study Visit : Once off-study , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform . - You physical exam . - Blood ( around 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You may also CT scan and/or MRI check status disease . Long-Term Follow-Up : After end-of-study visit , study visit every month first year year 10 year . At visit , physical exam . You may also CT scan and/or MRIs every 8 week 1st 6 month , every 3 month next year , every 6 month 1 1/2 year , least 1 time year . This do check status disease . Researchers would like keep track medical condition general health information yearly follow-up visit , letter , and/or phone contact , 10 year . More information ( treatment and/or disease response ) collect follow-up study show change disease overall health . If disease gotten bad , researcher keep track part body involve . Researchers also collect information cancer major organ problem might develop . Keeping touch checking condition help researcher look long-term effect study . This investigational study . Doxercalciferol FDA approve commercially available reduce high level hormone patient undergo chronic renal dialysis . Its use study , disease , investigational . Up 24 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
