	<detailed_description>A . Background Rationale . Despite availability proven safe effective treatment option , majority patient low trauma fracture under-investigated under-treated , indicate treatment osteoporosis fracture less optimal . Most published study intervention use coordinator recruit patient one academic centre health maintenance organization . However , Ontario , one-third fracture patient treat non-academic centre hospital dedicate osteoporosis fracture clinic coordinator underserviced osteoporosis specialist . It remain unclear whether impact great small centre coordinator function centralize across multiple centre ; hence need trial . B . Objectives 1 . The primary objective evaluate quality improvement program include physician patient osteoporosis recommendation regional osteoporosis coordinator increase proportion individual low trauma fracture receive appropriate management osteoporosis compare receive fall prevention advice . 2 . A secondary objective determine program result change perceive susceptibility , osteoporosis knowledge use supplement compare receive fall prevention advice . C. Methods . Design : cluster randomize control trial ( hospitals=cluster site ) outcome assessor data analyst blind group allocation . Patient population : patient 40 year old ( men woman ) present low trauma fracture hip , forearm/wrist , rib ( ) , sternum , thoracic lumbar spine , shoulder , upper arm , pelvis , low leg ankle . Hospitals treat 40 patients/year dedicate fracture clinic coordinator Emergency Department/Fracture Clinic consider . Hospital recruitment : 63 hospital 30 recruit ( 15 intervention 15 control ) ; 20 patient hospital identified expectation 10 consent study , total sample size 300 patient . Intervention : provide evidenced-based recommendation centralize osteoporosis coordinator follow-up fracture patient physicians provide information fracture risk osteoporosis treatment part educational outreach , assist order BMD test arrange consultation Multidisciplinary Osteoporosis Program ( MOP ) via telehealth require . For control sit process follow identifying fracture patient . They receive educational material telephone counsel regard fall prevention home safety encourage visit family physician . Data collection . Patients identify NACRS database . Baseline data collect osteoporosis coordinator . The questionnaire similar `` Fracture Clinic OP Screening Program '' . Follow-up data collect research assistant call consenting patient . Data Analysis . The analysis primary secondary outcome measure compare intervention control group carry level cluster ( hospital ) , base standard two-sample t-test 2 ( k-1 ) degrees freedom , k number site group ( α= 0.05 , power=1-β ) . D. Future implication . This trial increase understand implement care delivery model community term resource , service patient provider preference . At health system level trial direct relevance Ontario 's Osteoporosis Strategy .
