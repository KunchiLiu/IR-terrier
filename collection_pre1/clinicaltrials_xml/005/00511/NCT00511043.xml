	<brief_summary>This phase II open label study assess efficacy safety PTK787/ZK222584 adult relapse refractory diffuse large cell lymphoma ( DLCL ) . All subject receive PTK787/ZK222584 . Subjects tolerate study target dose 1250mg remain dose study completion 12 month disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent non-compliance protocol requirement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PTK787 Refractory Relapsed Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order tumor grow spread part body , need grow blood supply . Tumor cell show produce substance stimulate abnormal growth new blood vessel allow tumor grow . In adult , blood vessel cell normally divide rapidly . It think PTK787/ZK222584 may interfere growth new blood vessel . A drug interfere growth new blood vessel might stop tumor growth , possibly shrink tumor keep receive nutrient oxygen supply blood vessel . Since normal blood vessel cell divide rapidly , might possible stop tumor growth without harm normal tissue . The purpose study find investigational drug , PTK787/ZK 222584 safe effective treating relapse refractory diffuse large cell lymphoma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm DLCL ( de novo transform ) . Measurable/evaluable disease radiograph , physical exam bone marrow involvement . Refractory disease , induction chemotherapy failure relapse disease . Age ≥ 18 year old Performance Status : KPS ≥ 70 Laboratory test specify protocol . Written informed consent History known central nervous system disease ( i.e. , primary brain tumor , malignant seizure , CNS metastases carcinomatous meningitis ) . History another primary malignancy ≤ 5 year , exception inactive basal squamous cell carcinoma skin Prior chemotherapy ≤ 3 week prior registration . There limit number prior chemotherapy regimen . Prior allogeneic transplant &gt; 2.5 % donor cell remain engraftment study ( prior autologous transplant allow ) Prior biologic immunotherapy ≤ 2 week prior registration . Prior full field ( total organ site ) radiotherapy ≤ 4 week limited field radiotherapy ≤ 2 week prior registration . Major surgery ( i.e. , laparotomy ) ≤ 4 week prior registration . Minor surgery ≤ 2 week prior registration . Patients receive investigational drug ≤ 4 week prior registration and/or registration Prior therapy antiVEGF target agent Pleural effusion ascites cause respiratory compromise ( ≥ CTC grade 2 dyspnea ) QTc &gt; 450 ( male ) &gt; 470 ( female ) . Patients congenital acquire prolonged QTc syndrome Female patient pregnant breast feeding , adult reproductive potential employ effective method birth control . Any following concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition could compromise participation study : Uncontrolled high blood pressure , history labile hypertension , history poor compliance antihypertensive regimen Unstable angina pectoris Symptomatic congestive heart failure Myocardial infarction ≤ 6 month prior registration Serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia Uncontrolled diabetes Severe active uncontrolled infection Interstitial pneumonia extensive symptomatic interstitial fibrosis lung Chronic renal disease document nephritic nephrotic syndrome . Acute chronic liver disease Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption PTK787/ZK222584 Patients confirm diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection exclude investigator 's discretion he/she feel 1 ) potential drug interaction PTK787/ZK 222584 antiHIV medication could influence efficacy antiHIV medication , 2 ) may place patient risk due pharmacologic activity PTK787/ZK 222584 . Patients take therapeutic warfarin sodium ( Coumadin ) similar oral anticoagulant metabolize cytochrome P450 system . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration may interfere interpretation study result judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
