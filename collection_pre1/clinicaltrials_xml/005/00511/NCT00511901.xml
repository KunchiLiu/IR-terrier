	<brief_summary>Patients admit subacute rehabilitation facility follow hospitalization frequently anemic . The purpose study see anemic patient treat epoetin alfa high hemoglobin level well functional recovery 3 , 8 , 12 week study entry compare patient receive epoetin alfa .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence Treatment Anemia Rehabilitation Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia associate loss function study . However , unknown rapid correction anemia patient enter rehabilitation set surgery hospitalization acute medical problem lead short rehabilitation stay improve functional status . Patients age 60 old hemoglobin level less 10.5 g/dL randomize receive 8 weekly dos either erythropoietin alfa placebo . Functional status measure baseline 3 , 8 12 week . The follow specific aim test study : - Determine prevalence anemia patient admit subacute rehabilitation facility potential recovery . - Determine baseline functional status patient admit subacute rehabilitation facility potential recovery use Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) , assessment tool use acute rehabilitation setting . - Determine administration epoetin alfa result high hemoglobin concentration patient receive drug patient give placebo 3 , 8 12 week entry study . - Perform study establish feasibility trial test whether epoetin alfa produce improvement FIM , grip strength , time take patient reach rehabilitation goal , activity monitor , fatigue , mood , functional recovery reduces length rehabilitation stay .</detailed_description>
