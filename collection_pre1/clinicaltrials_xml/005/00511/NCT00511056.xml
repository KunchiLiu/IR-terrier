	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis : Do certain risk behaviour impact/predict level HIV antiretroviral adherence ? Objectives : - To assess risk behavior HIV-positive individual receive highly active antiretroviral therapy . ( HAART ) - To assess level adherence subject time point - To determine correlation HAART adherence risk behaviour</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adherence Risk Behaviour Patients With HIV Infection Receiving Antiretroviral Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale : Adherence effective antiretroviral ( ARV ) regimen important determinant treatment success patient receive ARV . It well establish virological suppression highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) require strict adherence prescribe dose schedule . It essential reach maintain therapeutic level drug , strict adherence particularly crucial prevent development drug-resistant viral strain . If therapeutic drug level suboptimal virus able replicate , important individual public health implication . Indirect evidence also suggest use HAART HIV-infected individual decrease sexual transmission HIV . Specifically , ARV treatment decrease serum genital fluid HIV viral load . It become evident availability HAART may paradoxically increase sexual practice lead HIV transmission . This see several developed country introduction HAART coincide increase sexual risk behaviour sexually transmit infection . Thus far little evidence show trend develop country . Despite high burden HIV develop country compare developed country , considerably evidence available latter regard adherence risk behaviour . Studies ascertain correlation two factor important new intervention may establish ensure improve health economic outcome follow . Understanding patient increase risk behaviour , risk non-adherence enables identification patient important target interventional strategy optimise HIV treatment programme . Adherence risk behaviour : Apart beneficial clinical effect HAART , treatment advance may unintended effect sexual behaviour . Evidence suggest since HAART become available , prevalence unprotected sex incidence sexually transmit infection include HIV increase , mostly among men sex men ( MSM ) . Some HIV positive person receive HAART , especially undetectable viral load , may feel protected transmit HIV sexually . Recent evidence suggest undetectable viral load may reduce level infectiousness HIV positive person receive HAART . As information move public domain may influence people beliefs HIV transmission lessen concern engage unsafe sex . People hold belief likely counterpart engage unprotected sex . HIV positive patient engage high-risk behaviour link HIV spread likely receive HAART low risk disease transmission , engage high-risk behaviour much low rate medication adherence thus much high viral load . This suggest strong behavioural basis transmission drug resistant HIV , parallel recent increase sexually transmit infection . Given take HAART undetectable viral load eliminate possibility transmit HIV , important examine whether use HAART beliefs HAART associate sexual risk take . Definitions : Risk behavior define behavior may result transmission HIV Study subject : Subjects ask complete questionnaire contain question adherence risk behaviour.At completion data collection analysis make accordingly . Approximately 700 patient HIV-NAT 006 provide consent enrol . Inclusion criterion : - Age ≥ 18 year - HIV seropositive . - On continuous HAART least 6 month - Signed write informed consent Methods : Cross sectional survey adherence behavior subject enrol HIVNAT 006 long term follow cohort . Patients enrol HIVNAT 006 normally required attend regular 6 monthly follow appointment . Over coming month 700 subject give consent ask complete anonymous self-administered questionnaire next clinic visit . Completion questionnaire facilitate people live HIV/AIDS ( PLHA ) train HIVNAT . The questionnaire comprise follow category : 1 . Demographics 2 . Medication adherence 3 . Factors affect adherence ( risk behaviour ) Furthermore follow extracted HIVNAT database : - CDC disease stage previous 12 month current consult - CD4 previous 12 month current consult - VL previous 12 month current consult - ARV regimen change regimen - Opportunistic infection</detailed_description>
