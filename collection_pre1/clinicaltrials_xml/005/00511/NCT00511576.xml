	<brief_summary>The purpose study test combination experimental drug know MGCD0103 give along FDA-approved drug call docetaxel . This Phase 1 study look different dos MGCD0103 give along docetaxel order well understand effect ( positive negative ) combination subject 's body disease . The study would like find following information : - How long MGCD0103 docetaxel stay subject 's body ; - What effect , good and/or bad , MGCD0103 docetaxel subject his/her cancer ; - If genetic chemical make-up subject 's blood cell tumor cell play role respond respond MGCD0103 docetaxel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Combination Treatment MGCD0103 Docetaxel ( Taxotere® ) Subjects With Advanced Cancer Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 study evaluate escalate dos orally administer MGCD0103 combination two fixed dos ( 60 mg/m2 75 mg/m2 ) IV docetaxel . In US , docetaxel recommend even high dos ( 100 mg/m2 ) , single agent combination cytotoxic drug ( e.g. , cisplatin , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , 5-fluorouracil ) , treatment NSCLC , prostate cancer , gastric adenocarcinoma , head neck cancer . In Japan , 60 mg/m2 IV docetaxel approve dose treatment breast cancer . MGCD0103 belong class selective , less globally cytotoxic agent investigate treatment cancer today , may offer less and/or non-overlapping toxicity profile cytotoxic agent docetaxel currently combine . MGCD0103 dose range 50 135 mg administer combination approve regimen azacitidine ( Vidaza® ) ( 75 mg/m2/day 5 day every 4 week ) patient high-risk MDS AML . A 50 mg dose MGCD0103 administer combination approve regimen gemcitabine ( 1000 mg/m2 weekly 3 consecutive week 4-week cycle ) patient advance solid tumor ; high dos MGCD0103 soon evaluate trial . Given , propose start dose 60 mg/m2 IV docetaxel 50 mg MGCD0103 consider appropriately safe initial investigation combination . Based result observe Part 1 , study may also evaluate 75 mg/m2 IV docetaxel escalate dos orally administer MGCD0103 Part 2 order determine whether dose regimen safe would also warrant investigation .</detailed_description>
