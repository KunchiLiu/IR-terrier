A highly effective method birth control define result low failure rate ( i.e . le 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly implantants , injectables , combine oral contraceptive , IUDs , sexual abstinence vasectomise partner . For subject use hormonal contraceptive method , information regard product investigation potential effect contraception must address . history idiopathic orthostatic hypotension , condition would predispose ( dehydration , hypovolaemia ) Risk transmit human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) hepatitis B C , via blood body fluids history noncompliance judge investigator Patients substance dependence . A urine drug screen perform . The investigator evaluate result along medical history determine patient meet DSMIV criterion substance dependence Patients know diabetes mellitus impair glucose tolerance , especially patient Diabetes Mellitus ( DM ) fulfil one follow criterion : unstable DM define enrollment glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) &gt; 8.5 % patient admitted hospital treatment DM DM relate illness past 12 week patient physician care DM physician responsible patient´s DM care indicate patient´s DM control physician responsible patient´s DM care approve patient´s participation study patient dose oral hypoglycemic drug ( ) and/or diet 4 week prior randomization . ( For thiazolidinediones ( glitazones ) period le 8 week ) patient take insulin whose daily dose one occasion past 4 week 10 % mean dose precede 4 week . Note : If diabetic patient meet one criterion , patient exclude even treat physician believe patient stable participate study . ECG consider show clinical significant abnormality enrolment determine cardiologist Use drug induce inhibit hepatic metabolizing cytochrome 3A4 enzyme within 2 week prior randomization ( e.g . inducer : phenytoin , carbamazepine , phenobarbital , rifampicin , rifabutin , glucocorticoid , thioridazine St. Johns´wort ( =Johanniskraut ) inhibitor : ketaconazole ( except topical use ) , itraconazole , fluconazole , erythromycin , clarithromycin , fluvoxamine , nefazodone , troleandomycin , indinavir , nelfinavir saquinavir ) . patient insufficient knowledge German language A thyroidstimulating hormone ( TSH ) concentration 10 % upper limit normal range laboratory use sample analysis enrolment , whether subject treat hypothyroidism Any serious unstable somatic illness ( e.g . malignant tumor , severe cardiovascular disease , etc . ) , opinion investigator , would negatively affect study medication would affect study medication . If relevant medical finding obtain examination , physician 's discretion initiate additional examination ( e.g . lab testing , ECG ) . If medically indicate examination already carry , result older two week time screen visit . The patient participate study study result within normal range examiner determine deviation clinically irrelevant . This clearly document CRF .
