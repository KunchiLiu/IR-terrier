A physical examination , complete blood count ( CBC ) , thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) level determine baseline Week 10 , vital sign ( pulse , blood pressure , weight , height , body mass index , temperature ) obtain visit . At visit , safety tolerability assess use structured side effect interview , Side Effects Form Children Adolescents . At baseline weekly visit , depression symptom severity determine Children 's Depression Rating Scale-Revised ( CDRS-R ) , 17-item observer-rated questionnaire , remission define CDRS-R score â‰¥28 . If patient 's depressive symptom worsen course trial ( defined 30 % worsen relative baseline two consecutive visit use CDRS-R score ) , withdrawn study . In view potential risk develop hypomanic symptom follow LCn-3 fatty acid supplementation , manic symptom severity monitor course trial Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) , 11-item observer-rated questionnaire . fMRI scan perform baseline 10 week .</detailed_description>
