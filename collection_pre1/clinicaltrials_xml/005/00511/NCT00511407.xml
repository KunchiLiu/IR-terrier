	<brief_summary>Although conventional hemodialysis remove waste product correct fluid imbalance , replace critical absorptive , metabolic , endocrine , immunologic function perform healthy renal tubule cell . This trial involve patient acute renal failure evaluate efficacy safety extracorporeal renal assist device ( RAD ) contain human renal tubule cell connect conventional hemodialysis circuit . It hypothesize short-term ( 72-h ) use cell therapeutic device improve survival ARF patient compare patient receive conventional continuous renal replacement therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Label Study To Evaluate Safety Efficacy Renal Assist Device In Patients With Acute Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute Renal Failure ( ARF ) severe inflammatory disease state often accompany Multi-Organ Failure ( MOF ) Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ( SIRS ) . ARF precipitate many factor often link loss kidney tubule cell function . Patients ARF treat intensive care unit hospital , recovery renal function vitally important survival . Current therapy ARF involve conventional kidney support continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) . Despite advance treat patient CRRT , ARF extremely high mortality rate ( 55-70 % ) require extensive hospital stay , predominantly ICU . The RAD design treat ARF MOF and/or SIRs facilitate natural recovery patient 's kidney function . The RAD intend use short period time conventional extracorporeal therapeutic system already available hospital . The RAD therapy operate outside body design mimic structure function natural kidney . In manner intend replace miss metabolic , endocrine , immunologic function kidney allow time patient 's kidney resume normal function .</detailed_description>
