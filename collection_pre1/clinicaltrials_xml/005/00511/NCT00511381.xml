	<detailed_description>Two major limitation exist audiometric newborn hear screen program inability detect form deafness express birth low compliance obtain recommend audiologic confirmation and/or follow-up . Molecular genetic test blood spot newborns identify risk frequent cause late-onset hearing loss add infant group receive continue audiologic monitoring . The specific aim project : - Demonstrate utility detect four potentially important cause delay onset hearing loss molecular test birth , may miss current audiometric screening test . - Document frequency , clinical genetic characteristic hear loss associate condition . Dried blood spot ( DBS ) filter paper obtain use project parental inform consent 6,000 newborn infant approximately 25 hospital . Pediatrix Screening , subsidiary Pediatrix Medical Group long experience high throughput neonatal testing , perform genetic testing sample . The four genetic environmental form deafness studied include : - Prenatal/congenital cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection -Detecting presence CMV viral DNA dry blood spot . - Connexin Deafness - GJB2 GJB6 mutation - Cx26 35delG , Cx26 235delC , Cx26 167delT , Cx26 M34T , Cx30 large deletion . ( Under sublicense Athena Diagnostics , Inc : United States Patent Numbers : 5,998,147 6,485,908 patent pending ) - Pendred Syndrome - SLC26A mutation - L236P , 1001 +1G &gt; A , T416P , E384G - Mitochondrial Mutations - T961C , T961G , G951A , 961 delT+C ( n ) Ins , G7444A , A7445G , A7445C .</detailed_description>
