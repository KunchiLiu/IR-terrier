	<detailed_description>Abstract Background : On last year rise public awareness danger potential lie exposure hazardous dust different profession . The examination induce sputum use early eighty research diagnose inflammatory lung disease . We assess patient lung disease occupational history , order undergo work assess hazardous dust exposure . Aim : validate qualitative analysis Scanning Electron Microscope ( SEM ) lung sample first induce sputum correlation disease second compare hazardous particle induce sputum analysis lung tissue finally assess particle present transplant patient correlated occupational history . Methods : 40 patient refer occupational history include . For 24 SEM analysis do induced sputum ( IS ) together questionnaires 11 among SEM analysis do lung tissue ( TS ) IS . In addition 11 lung biopsy patient occupational history scan SEM compare 10 biopsy patient occupational history .</detailed_description>
