	<brief_summary>This phase II multicenter , open-label study design investigate feasibility ( tolerance , compliance safety ) combination tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI 571 ( GLIVEC , Novartis Pharma ) pegylated *-Interferon 2b ( PEG INTRON ) . The rationale test combination 1 ) aIFN curently first line agent treatment CML , 2 ) pegylated formulation aIFN convenient well tolerate conventional formulation , 3 ) STI571 currently promise investigational agent treatment CML target molecular base disease , effective also advanced phase disease , effective also case resistant aIFN , 4 ) mechanism action two agent different . Therefore combination STI571 PEGINTRON likely provide best treatment CML test soon randomized phase III study efficacy . So far STI571 PEGINTRON investigate separately . The present study exploratory study plan aim evaluate adverse event safety combination , identify safe tolerable regime test prospectively efficacy subsequent , randomized phase III study . Based available knowledge data , STI571 specific effective PEGINTRON . Therefore exploratory study STI571 give priority PEGINTRON dose dose adaptation . Sixty subject chronic phase CML , previously untreated one study drug , enrol 3 month period treat studied 12 month . The patient pretreated hydroxyurea , whenever require , hence treat STI 571 fix dose ( 400mg ) PEG-Intron dos range 50 150 *g weekly ( first cohort 20 patient 50 *g/w , second cohort 20 patient 100 *g/w third cohort 20 patient 150 *g/w ) . The response ( hematologic , cytogenetic molecular ) combination treatment evaluate every 3 month , pharmacokinetics study drug study sample study patient . The duration study 12 month , total trial time 15 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STI 571 *IFN two single effective agent treatment CML . Their mechanisms action different . Their toxicity also different , spare normal hemopoietic stem cell . STI 571 well tolerate , conventional *IFN poorly tolerate , especially elderly . PEG *IFNs go substitute conventional *IFNs well pharmacokinetic toxicity profile require less injection ( week vs. day ) .Resistance IFN ( 6-13 ) STI571 ( 29-34 ) occur vitro vivo , increase time IFN also expect increase time STI571 . STI571 IFN different mechanism action show vitro combination STI571 alfaIFN toxic either agent alone Ph positive cell ( 35-37 ) . Therefore , combination STI 571 PEG *IFN worth test . A phase II , dose-finding , exploratory study require investigate feasibility , toxicity , safety tolerability combination . In CML , PEG INTRON study advance PEGASIS study . These consideration provide rationale phase II study STI 571 PEG INTRON CML .</detailed_description>
