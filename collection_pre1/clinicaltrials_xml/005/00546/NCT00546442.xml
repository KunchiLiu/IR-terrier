	<detailed_description>Differents study show infection virus hepatitis C relevant rol development insulin resistance . The insulin resistence associate progression fibrosis development steatosis . The insulin resistence frecuently associate difficult cure patient cirrhotics , afro-american patient , overweight patient co-infected HCV-HIV patient . Recently repported sustained virological ( SVR ) response genotype 1 patient different accord insulin resistance . The SVR 60 % patient without insulin resistance versus 20 % patient strong insulin resistance ( HOMA &gt; 4 . The present trial desire analyze effect treatment insulin resistance produce high range RVS .</detailed_description>
