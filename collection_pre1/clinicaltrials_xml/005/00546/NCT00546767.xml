	<brief_title>Home-Based Assessment Alzheimer Disease Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There unmet need effective , efficient , economical method conduct AD prevention trial . Traditional in-person visit clinical assessment site time consume costly may exclude people participation , old , less mobile significant medical illness . These may people great risk cognitive decline , also may without financial resource service transportation study site . Prevention trial require long observation period issue health , resource , transportation may cause significant drop . These obstacle increase expense clinical trial require large sample size , costly clinical staff long observation period . Thus , home-based assessment may lead representative recruitment risk decline , well good retention reduce study cost . This randomize study 600 participant , compare three method test administration data collection . Each enrol participant In-person ( Standard ) assessment ( clinic home ) prior baseline . Participants classify either normal MCI ( Mild Cognitive Impairment ) randomly assign assessment method frequency assessment . Cognitive performance , self-rated cognitive complaint , function daily life , affective symptom , global change , quality life resource use assess method visit . The total time at-home assessment approximately 45 minute . In addition , participant provide multi-vitamin take twice day , measure medication adherence collect assessment method . Changes certain cognitive measure may `` trigger '' in-person assessment , participant may change categorization normal amnestic MCI , non-amnestic MCI , impair MCI , dementia ( i.e. , specifically Alzheimer 's Disease another dementia ) . We estimate 12 % study population trigger 4 year study progress impair diagnostic category . In addition , random sample non-triggered case ( 25 % ) select in-person re-assessment 4 year protocol comparison trigger group . At end 4-year study period participant undergo in-person evaluation .</detailed_description>
