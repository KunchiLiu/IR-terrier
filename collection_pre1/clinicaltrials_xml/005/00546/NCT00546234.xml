	<brief_summary>The study 's research question concern appropriateness use tiotropium patient asthma current smoker . It suggest patient asthma smoke , may fact share similarities patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Because , study determine whether sub-group patient would fact benefit therapy currently approve market COPD patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tiotropium Smoking Asthmatics Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design open label cross-over study . Ethical approval obtain University Alberta Health Research Ethics Board University Saskatchewan Health Research Ethics Board . Following informed consent , obtain pulmonary function test subject . If subject currently prescribe long act beta agonist ( LABA ) stop continue study subject , subject , re-assessed two week . We also measure exhale NO ( eNO ) use standard establish American Thoracic Society . Additionally obtain urine sample frozen store subsequent metabolite profile NMR spectroscopy . Subjects currently prescribe LABA 's test do two week stop medication . We obtain routine demographic information include age , sex , usual asthma medication usage . We also obtain health relate quality life status use generic ( 15D ) disease specific ( Asthma Quality Life ) questionnaires . Subjects instruct regard use peak flow meter typical symptom associate loss asthma control . They instruct regard access dedicate asthma website ( Virtual Asthma Clinic ) incorporate question . There also place subject enter twice daily peak flow measurement . The website password protect subject access individualize data entry page . A research coordinator able access subject data use unique password . We use internet-based program monitor daily PEF , daily asthma symptom asthma-related quality life . Patients instructed access website daily re-assessed two week . Subjects instruct continue usual asthma management log asthma website daily record symptom twice daily peak flow . Peak flow consist pre-bronchodilator peak expiratory flow take morning evening . Only subject meeting criterion well control asthma ( GOAL criterion ) along objective compliance study protocols two week enrol next phase study . For next two week study , subject randomly allocate take either regularly prescribe inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) long act beta agonist ( LABA ) regularly prescribe ICS tiotropium . At end period subject return spirometry , urine sample measurement eNO . This follow two week wash-out period subject take inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) . For subsequent two week subject take treatment receive first two week . At end period subject return spirometry , urine sample measurement eNO . During fifth period two week duration , subject take LABA tiotropium . Subjects return final measurement spirometry , urine sample eNO . Subjects show variability symptom consistent poor asthma control , refer back treat physician clinical information . All subject instruct return medication regimen initiate physician prior study . If subject experience clinical exacerbation , instructed return test site . They instruct increase controller medication continue increase steroid phase study . Any subject experiencing severe asthma exacerbation ( describe ) withdrawn study . Assuming approximately 30 % severe exacerbation rate per year population , would anticipate one two patient would normally experience severe exacerbation 10 week course . If four subject experience severe exacerbation , hold trial external review unblinded data . This include review patient compliance study protocol . If exacerbation tiotropium group stop study . We anticipate use on-line data collection tool ( VAC ) , study coordinator able see exacerbation develop early point able effectively intervene prevent severe exacerbation . A mild clinical exacerbation define one follow event : 1 . A decrease peak flow le 80 % best effort two consecutive day . 2 . An increase reliever medication ( fast act beta agonist ) 50 % baseline need two consecutive day . 3 . Waking night due asthma two consecutive night . A severe exacerbation define need additional medical contact treatment asthma ( e.g. , emergency room , walk-in clinic ) hospital admission asthma . The need oral corticosteroid also constitute severe exacerbation . If point subject undergo severe exacerbation , examine either treat physician one physician associate study appropriate escalation treatment commence . The HREB inform severe exacerbation . The study coordinator one study physicians available pager course study .</detailed_description>
