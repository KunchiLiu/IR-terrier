	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare treatment call remote ischemic preconditioning ( rIP ) treatment . rIP simple treatment believe help patient recover good heart surgery . This treatment involve apply large blood pressure cuff one leg . The blood pressure cuff inflate 5 minute deflate 5 minute . This do 4 time row .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Protection Heart With Remote Ischemic Preconditioning During Heart Surgery : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : 1 . Determine , pilot study , surrogate marker rIP detect patient present cardiac surgery . Specifically measure effect rIP expression profile HSP-70 , iNOS , PKC-E , p38 MAPK , PI3K , sarcolemmal KATP 2 . Determine rIP influence expression gene know influence substrate preference thereby myocardial metabolism patient undergoing heart surgery . Specifically expression HIF-1a , PPAR-a AMPK Hypothesis : We hypothesize rIP provide myocardial protection patient present heart surgery protection define distinct gene expression profile regard gene involve rIP myocardial metabolism . Study Design : This proposal randomize blind pilot study use rIP patient require heart surgery . Study Population : The study include 100 male female patient undergo elective heart surgery cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . Randomization : Patients randomize 1:1 receive either rIP treatment . Blinding Procedures : The patient blind well perform experimental analysis . Interventions : Remote Ischemic Preconditioning rIP induce immediately follow induction anesthesia . Four 5 minute cycle low unilateral limb ischemia reperfusion induce tourniquet inflation 300 mmHg constitute precondition stimulus . Blood sample collection/analysis 1 . Two cardiac biopsy ( 50 - 200 mg ) collect pre-bypass post- bypass analyze gene protein expression . 2 . Blood sample ( 4 mL ) drawn immediately induction anesthesia , time cardiac tissue sample harvest analyzed gene/protein expression well 1 , 24 , 48 72 hour post surgery . Troponin I NT-ProBNP measure baseline , 1 , 24 , 48 72 hour surgery 3 mL blood collect test . A total 43 mL blood collect per patient . 3. rIP induce change leukocyte gene expression measure aforementioned time point . Other ECG assessment post-operative day 1 , 2 , 3 . National Institute Health stroke scale assessment conduct screen post operatively prior hospital discharge . Each patient receive telephone follow-up call 30 day post operatively collect adverse event mortality data . Experimental Methods : 1. qRT-PCR use measure gene expression . 2 . Immunoblotting used measure protein expression</detailed_description>
