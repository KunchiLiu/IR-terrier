	<detailed_description>Much research effort direct towards improve end-of-life ( EOL ) care US . However , consensus large gap knowledge remain regarding quality EOL care , notably previous research focus narrowly defined population . There little known individual different ethnic , cultural , socioeconomic background . There evidence individual may desire experience EOL care differently may encounter barrier obtain care . What known intervention effective population . This study address EOL care homeless people , extreme example overlook population . They great risk death US , unique perspective good EOL care , encounter significant barrier care , lack resource relationship assume necessary good EOL care . Despite , interventional study determine whether EOL care improve population . Encouraging individual document preference EOL care Advance Directives ( ADs ) , central effort improve EOL care . ADs , however , subject conceptual empirical criticism , particularly may ultimately affect EOL care receive . However , shortcoming mainly demonstrate specific similar population , address underserved population . There reason believe ADs advance care plan different utility efficacy homeless person much desire population . This proposal build upon four year research , include NIH/NINR-funded investigation , regard EOL care , die , death . This research first work define concern homeless person regard EOL care confirm relevance potential ADs population impact EOL care positively . We seek test intervention improve EOL care homeless person : 300 participant randomize two arm , guide intervention ( GI ) minimal intervention ( MI ) . The GI condition expose participant education , guidance counseling , AD tool , designate HELP ( Appendix A ) , specifically design underserved estrange population enhance autonomy elicit preference EOL care . The MI condition expose participant provision HELP instruction , mimic community standard requirement federal PSDA . Primary Aim 1 : To determine whether homeless individual complete AD whether guidance enhances rate completion . Hypothesis 1 : We hypothesize MI result great completion rate population others study , GI result significantly great rate MI - anticipate 20 % completion rate MI condition 50 % rate GI condition . Primary Aim 2 : To determine whether completion ADs homeless individual lead use county hospital care encounter 18 month intervention . Hypothesis 2 : We hypothesize complete ADs exist , use documented part clinical care least 70 % time county health care encounter . It important test appropriate , reproducible intervention underserved population , insight project significant several way : help address EOL concern homeless person , provide basis address need others disenfranchise loved one and/or receive fragment , episodic care , rural urban poor , homebound person , undocumented person .</detailed_description>
