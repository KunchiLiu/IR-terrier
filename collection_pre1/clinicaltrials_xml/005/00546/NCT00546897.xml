	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Without Chromosome 5q Abnormalities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence AML increase age , current treatment option older patient population newly diagnose AML ( AML &gt; = 60 ) limit , poor outcome . AML &gt; = 60 patient likely poor-risk cytogenetics abnormality , many precede myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . Traditional induction chemotherapy approach AML cytarabine anthracyclines yield remission 45-60 % AML &gt; = 60 , however vast majority patient relapse median survival 9 month . These patient rarely candidate potentially curative allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Many untreated AML &gt; = 60 patient candidate aggressive therapy , receive therapy significant induction mortality 10-20 % , significant hematologic toxicity occur 30 % , change overall survival compare supportive care . AML &gt; = 60 patient favorable risk cytogenetics modest improvement prognosis , example 5 year overall survival ~20 % , compare 0 % cytogenetic category . Thus , eligible patient AML &gt; = 60 recommend clinical trial , regardless whether would offer generally ineffective traditional induction chemotherapy . More effective less toxic therapy need treatment AML old patient population , indeed prefer first line therapy national cancer center network ( NCCN ) guideline AML clinical trial . In trial lenalidomide patient MDS dose lenalidomide reduce myelotoxicity and/or thrombocytopenia . However , current paradigm therapy acute myeloid leukemia base use high dos myelosuppressive chemotherapy support patient 4-5 week period neutropenia/thrombocytopenia attempt eliminate malignant clone . Based efficacy relate myeloid disorder MDS , close relationship MDS AML patient &gt; 60 , trial employ paradigm myelosuppressive therapy use high dose lenalidomide instead chemotherapy . Importantly , within MDS trial use low dos lenalidomide , response observe 3/9 ( 33 % ) patient excess blast ( RAEB/RAEB-t ) , classify evolve AML AML . This suggest therapeutic effect lenalidomide occur set large percentage blast , AML , although dose schedule lenalidomide administration different . The response AML &gt; = 60 patient propose high dose lenalidomide regimen unknown . Following high dose lenalidomide , patient response , propose use low dose maintenance strategy similar FDA approve dose MDS . The maintenance phase include standard dose reduction unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>

Life expectancy &gt; 2 month Adequate organ function define : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5X institution upper limit normal ( ULN ) Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 5 x ULN Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test sensitivity least 50 mIU/mL within 10 14 day prior within 24 hour start lenalidomide must either commit continued abstinence heterosexual intercourse begin TWO acceptable method birth control , one highly effective method one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME , least 28 day start take lenalidomide . FCBP must also agree ongoing pregnancy test . Men must agree use latex condom sexual contact FCBP even successful vasectomy . All patient must counsel minimum every 28 day pregnancy precaution risk fetal exposure . Disease free prior malignancy ≥ 5 year exception currently treat basal cell , squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma `` situ '' cervix breast . Received prior treatment AML Favorable risk cytogenetic abnormality define SWOG criterion ( http : //www.bloodjournal.org/cgi/content/abstract/96/13/4075 ) include : inv ( 16 ) /t ( 16 ; 16 ) /del ( 16q ) , ( 15 ; 17 ) with/without secondary aberration , ( 8 ; 21 ) lack del ( 9q ) complex karyotype ( 16 ) .
