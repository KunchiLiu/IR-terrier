	<detailed_description>The introduction biologics specific molecular target initiate trend toward improved survival woman metastatic breast cancer . The tyrosine kinase SRC ( pp60src ) member family proteins contribute cellular signal transduction activity cell growth , differentiation , survival , adhesion migration . Abnormal signal link cancer metastasis ; thus , identification molecular regulator inhibitor SRC present therapeutic opportunity cancer patient . Src kinases consist eight non-receptor tyrosine kinase ( Src , Fyn , Yes , Lck , Lyn , Hck , Fgr Blk ) interact intracellular domain growth factor/cytokine receptor , ( G-protein-coupled receptor ) GPCRs integrins . Inhibition SRC also associate reversal chemoresistance restore sensitivity drug-resistant ovarian cancer cell , suggest potential second- line treatment previously treat population . Dasatinib potent , broad spectrum inhibitor 5 critical oncogenic tyrosine kinase , include SRC . Patients receive dasatinib , Src inhibitor , initial dose 50 mg PO BID , real-time PharmacoDynamic dose adjustment follow 4 week therapy base inhibition phosphorylation SRC , focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) paxillin , progression . The primary objective ass tolerability estimate proportion patient progression-free 16 week date study enrollment . A minimum 2 ( maximum 3 ) tumor biopsy analyze compare SRC signature : one baseline ( study enrollment , patient ) ; second 4 week dasatinib therapy ( patient ) ; third progression ( patient progress document response ) . Patients receive continuous daily administration document disease progression , follow death . The result study may useful design future study use dasatinib alone combination chemotherapy , thus potential alter current standard care incurable population . Additional correlative study conduct . Tumor biopsies analyze compare SRC , pSRC , Ki67 , related genomic signature .</detailed_description>
