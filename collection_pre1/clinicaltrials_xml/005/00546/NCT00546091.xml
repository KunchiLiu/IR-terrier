	<brief_summary>This study explore us three noninvasive image techniques-thermography , laser Doppler imaging , multispectral imaging-to test blood flow healthy volunteer . By compare three technique , researcher able train image system well evaluate skin type blood flow . The study also test computer program develop correct effect curvature body hair image . Healthy volunteer must older 18 year age may history malignant tumor , skin disease , vascular disease . Participants undergo follow procedure outpatient basis : Three different type image take participant forearm - Thermography infrared thermal image map skin temperature - Laser Doppler image low-powered laser image map blood flow skin - Multispectral image near-infrared light image measure total blood flow oxygen level skin A reactive hyperemia experiment , multispectral image take participant forearm use blood pressure cuff A hair removal experiment , image collect participant forearm separate scan do hair remove topical hair removal solution The entire series exam take approximately one hour perform .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design calibrate three non-invasive non-ionizing imaging technique 12 healthy volunteer . The three image technique -- thermography , laser Doppler image multi-spectral imaging -- approve since 2001 four clinical protocol already approve NIH/NCI IRB use patient Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) . However , laboratory continue study analyze image collect protocol , find analysis algorithm require additional data healthy volunteer . We aim use information gather healthy volunteer protocol train image system calibrate analysis method validate result KS data already collect . We aim study different skin type , Caucasian , Asian African American , calibrate melanin input value multi-spectral image reconstruction algorithm . We also need study vasculature network forearm volunteer compare 'normal ' value literature parameter explore , include temperature , vasculature , blood volume blood oxygenation validate reconstruction algorithm . We also perform experiment reactive hyperemia , arm volunteer occlude arm pressure cuff five minute , study blood volume blood oxygenation change experiment . Trends increasing/decreasing blood volume blood oxygenation also compare publish literature validate reconstruction algorithm . Since start collect data KS patient , noticed hair curvature surface skin interfere analysis technique well . Therefore , aim ass algorithm develop remove effect curvature hair image part image analysis training . The intensity image affect curvature must correct . We develop algorithms correct curvature , need study normal disease-free skin make sure value blood volume blood oxygenation remain curvature correction perform . We also plan collect image healthy volunteer arm , remove hair arm use topical hair removal solution , image arm . With information , optimize hair removal algorithm . Combining aforementioned information allow u develop non-invasive strategy repeat serial assessment tissue vasculature . When follow KS lesion time , vascular / metabolic change lesion important . An additional parameter interest follow treatment time , structure lesion . Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) non-invasive , non-contact optical imaging technology , provide desired structural information high resolution three dimension ( 3D ) area interest . Therefore aim combine OCT multi-spectral data , relate metabolic state tissue structure . By , hypothesize get deep understand tissue vasculature , also improve multi-spectral imaging modality , use structure prior information reconstruction .</detailed_description>
