	<brief_summary>Dose dense chemotherapy , term Adriamycin Cyclophosphamide ( AC ) follow Taxol chemotherapy give every two week , standard chemotherapy treatment ER+ PR+ breast cancer . In trial , standard chemotherapy combine bevacizumab . Bevacizumab antibody work differently way chemotherapy drug work . Bevacizumab slow stop cell growth cancerous tumor decrease blood supply tumor bind substance find cancer cell call VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) . Bevacizumab approve FDA treatment colorectal cancer lung cancer . However , approve treatment breast cancer . Another goal research determine whether develop way identify tumor respond well study treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- To prepare surgery occur end study treatment , small `` clip '' place tumor area surgeon locate site tumor time surgery . This standard procedure breast cancer . - During clip placement , needle insert tumor measure interstitial fluid pressure ( IFP measurement ) . IFP do research purpose help understand tumor responds study treatment . - Study treatment begin one dose bevacizumab alone , follow two week later chemotherapy bevacizumab eight two-week cycle . The study treatment give intravenously clinic . - After first dose bevacizumab prior start chemotherapy , needle biopsy breast tumor perform research purpose . A second measurement IFP also do time . - During treatment period , test procedure perform specified interval include follow : research MRI , physical exam , blood test , urine test , EKG , MUGA ECHO . - Surgery remove tumor occur less four week last dose Paclitaxel .</detailed_description>
