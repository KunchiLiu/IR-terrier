	<criteria>Skeletally mature Provide inform consent Sufficient acetabular femoral bone stock seat prosthesis Willing able return followup specify study protocol Willing able complete hip outcome questionnaire quality life survey ( SF12 ) Undergo hip replacement due noninflammatory joint disease , include osteoarthritis , avascular necrosis , congenital hip dysplasia posttraumatic arthritis . Diagnosis inflammatory arthritides rheumatoid arthritis , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , systemic lupus , erythematosis etc . Active infection may spread system osteomyelitis , pyogenic infection hip joint overt infection , etc . Loss musculature , neuromuscular compromise vascular deficiency affect limb impedes evaluation . Poor bone quality ( e.g . osteoporosis ) concern ability inadequate bone stock support implant . Morbid obesity Involvement high level activity participation active sport Involvement heavy manual labor employment Increased likelihood fall due concomitant illness impairment Pregnancy , breastfeeding , prisoner , mentally incompetent , know alcohol drug abuser Diagnosis metabolic disorder receive systemic pharmacological treatment lead progressive deterioration solid bone support implant Known history condition may interfere total hip arthroplasty survival outcome ( e.g . Paget 's disease , Charcot 's disease ) Known presence active metastatic neoplastic disease Known allergic reaction implant material ( e.g . ceramic , metal ) Known history tissue reaction implant corrosion implant wear debris Disabilities joint impedes evaluation ( e.g . knee , ankle ) Known presence highly communicable disease disease may limit followup ( e.g . immunocompromised condition , hepatitis , active tuberculosis etc . ) Previous prosthetic hip replacement device ( type include THA , surface replacement arthroplasty , endoprosthesis etc . )</criteria>
