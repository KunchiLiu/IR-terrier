	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy endovascular repair , use Thoracic EXCLUDER Endoprosthesis , use treatment descend thoracic aortic disease indicate radiological testing time discharge , 1 , 6 , 12 month annually follow implantation , determine proportion patient experience adverse event implantation procedure , include disease-specific overall mortality rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study Thoracic Excluder Endoprosthesis Treat Descending Thoracic Aortic Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thoracic aortic aneurysm , relatively rare , potentially lethal disorder poor long-term prognosis treat . As aortic diameter increase , wall tension become high , leading expansion aneurysm . Consequently , disease process `` progressive self propagate '' phenomenon , natural history disease progressive expansion aneurysm eventual rupture . Patients descend thoracic aortic aneurysm frequently concomitant major medical condition , make poor candidate major surgical procedure . Concomitant condition may include : hypertension , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , congestive heart failure , peripheral vascular disease , include abdominal aortic aneurysm , previous stroke peripheral arterial occlusive disease . The accepted treatment aneurysm deem warrant intervention surgical resection repair . Operative post operative complication contribute early mortality surgical repair descend thoracic aortic aneurysm include low cardiac output , pulmonary insufficiency , myocardial infarction , postoperative hemorrhage , pulmonary embolism sepsis . In addition mortality , two grave complication surgical procedure , neurologic complication due spinal cord ischemia , paraplegia paraparesis , renal failure dysfunction , remain common . Dissections , another disease process descend thoracic aorta , rare . Aortic dissection think start tear disruption intimal lining aorta , either due medial degenerative disease , trauma rupture ulcerate intimal plaque . Blood systemic arterial pressure invades underlie medial layer aortic wall , dissect layer aortic wall , form false lumen . The dissection propagate vary distance vary direction along length aorta . As false lumen increase size , arterial flow true aortic lumen artery arise aorta may block disrupt . Depending upon location primary intimal tear direction dissection propagation , various vital organ may loose arterial blood supply , aorta may rupture pericardial sac pleural space , lead cardiac tamponade free pleural rupture . Blood flow false lumen may reenter true lumen another intimal tear , may occur proximal distal first , depend direction dissection propagation . Medical therapy first line treatment dissection descend thoracic aorta , aim reduce mean , peak diastolic recoil arterial pressure dP/dt maintain sufficient pressure adequately perfuse vital organ . Surgical intervention warrant patient progression dissection , impend rupture , refractory hypertension , sizable localize false aneurysmal component , continue pain . A device design treat disease process descend thoracic aorta . The Thoracic EXCLUDER Endoprosthesis device allow primary endovascular repair descend thoracic aorta intend use intraluminal blood conduit . The Thoracic EXCLUDER Endoprosthesis flexible , self-expanding endoprosthesis constrain leading end delivery catheter . A separate balloon catheter , Thoracic EXCLUDER Balloon Catheter , use smooth endoprosthesis follow implantation . Subjects undergo evaluation endoprosthesis , also evaluate device procedure related adverse event may occur follow-up period . Follow-up complete 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month . Subject evaluation 1 3 month include complete Physical Examination CT contrast enhancement . Subject evaluation 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month also undergo complete Physical Examination , CT contrast enhancement , Chest X-Ray ( AP , Lateral , 2 oblique ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Thoracic aortic disease deem warrant exclusion order prevent rupture extension include dissection transections . Anatomy meet Thoracic EXCLUDER Endoprosthesis specification criterion . Minimum 2 cm nonaneurysmal segment proximal distal aneurysm . &lt; 60 angle aortic arch may require additional length non aneurysmal segment arch include treatment segment . The patient `` high risk '' status surgical repair . The patient characterize presence comorbid factor and/or thoracic aortic pathology place patient category prohibitive risk open repair , , without intervention , adverse event could anticipate within day week . The patient ASA score IV V. Ability comply protocol requirement include followup . Signed Informed Consent Form . &gt; 4 mm aortic taper inability use device different diameter , compensate taper , treatment area aorta . Significant thrombus proximal distal implantation site . Planned occlusion leave carotid celiac artery , unless supplemental conduit provide . Myocardial infarction within six week . Degenerative connective tissue disease , e.g . Marfan 's Ehler Danlos Syndrome , unless proximal distal implantation site Thoracic EXCLUDER Endoprosthesis locate within previously place surgical graft . Female child bear potential positive pregnancy test .</criteria>
