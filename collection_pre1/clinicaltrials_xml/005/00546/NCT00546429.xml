	<brief_title>DePuy Trochanteric ( ATN ) Nailing Clinical Outcomes Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proximal femoral fracture among common femoral fracture . In past plate screw often use repair fracture treatment limitation include restricted weight bearing . Intermedullary nail alternative plate screw treatment . Weight bearing allow procedure less invasive . Among intramedullary nail complication iatrogenic fracture divide trochanteric femoral shaft fracture . Trochanteric fracture often heal without additional intervention however femoral shaft fracture usually require additional surgical procedure facilitate healing . This study monitor fracture heal use clinical radiographic evaluation subject trochanteric fracture proximal femur treat ATN system .</detailed_description>
