	<brief_summary>This study examine response white blood cell bacterial infection blood take umbilical cord newly deliver infant . The blood sample take male infant carry term male infant bear prematurely , genetic study compare blood sample sample draw healthy adult male volunteer . The study design look way immune system newborn infant respond bacterial infection . Participants study pregnant Chinese woman admit labor ward Prince Wales Hospital ( Sha Tin district New Territories , Hong Kong SAR ) normal spontaneous delivery . Those know blood-borne infectious disease HIV hepatitis B exclude study . Cord blood placenta sample collect completion delivery . The sample collect study restrict male newborn . A comparison group blood sample draw healthy male adult 25 35 year age ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Infant Immune Response Bacterial Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bacterial infection preterm neonates significant clinical problem . Neutrophils play critical role bactericidal process , immature newborn though peripheral blood neutrophil count similar high old child adult . The use steroid enhance lung maturation premature infant complicate problem . Many study show different biological activity lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) activate neonatal cord blood neutrophil adult peripheral blood neutrophil . In spite number previous study , genetic basis differential response LPS-activation remain unknown . In study , identify differential gene expression profile LPS-activated adult peripheral blood versus cord blood neutrophils term preterm infant whole genome ligonucleotide microarray . We investigate prim effect histologic chorioamnionitis ( HCA ) , severe infection/inflammation implicate many neonatal disease , immune response neutrophil term gene expression . The effect prenatal administration steroid immune response preterm neutrophils another question address propose study . This study provide insight molecular basis genetic regulation neutrophil development . We expect identify novel gene differential expression LPS-activated cord blood neutrophil compare LPS-activated adult cell . Aberrant transcript due prim effect HCA immune response term neutrophil also provide insight defense mechanism subsequent exposures bacterial infection . This collaborative study . All sample collect Collaborators Chinese University Hong Kong , Hong Kong . We perform expression profile Laboratory Clinical Genomics NICHD . This protocol approve Joint Clinical Research Ethics Committee Chinese University Hong Kong Hospital Authority Hong Kong .</detailed_description>
