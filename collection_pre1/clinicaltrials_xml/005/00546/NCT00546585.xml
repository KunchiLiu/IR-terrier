	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety , adverse event side effect , body 's immune response experimental flu vaccine [ Inactivated Influenza A/H7N7 Vaccine ] give increase dos . Researchers try find small dose flu vaccine need cause antibody responses flu virus single repeat dos . The study enroll 125 healthy adult range age 18 40 year old . Subjects give 2 dos vaccine 28 day apart . Study procedure include obtain medical history , physical exam , blood sample collection , use patient memory aid . The volunteer study 7 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , dose-ranging , Phase I/II , influenza study compare safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity increase dos monovalent subvirion influenza A/H7N7 virus vaccine administer intramuscular ( IM ) injection healthy adult . A total 125 healthy adult range 18 40 year old enrol one site study . The subject randomize receive saline placebo 7.5 , 15 , 45 , 90 mcg influenza A/H7N7 vaccine intramuscular ( IM ) injection approximate 1:1:1:1:1 ratio ( N=25/vaccine dose group 25 placebo group ) . Subjects receive 2 dos separate approximately 28 day . Subjects observe clinic minimum 30 minute inoculation . All subject maintain memory aid record oral temperature systemic local adverse event ( AEs ) 7 day immunization . Subjects contact telephone 1-3 day vaccination assess occurrence AEs , return clinic Day 8 12 AE concomitant medication assessment , target physical examination ( indicate ) , review memory aid . Serum immunogenicity evaluation obtain subject prior first vaccination , Day 28 prior second vaccination , Days 56 208 . A Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) review available 7 day safety data approximately Day 20 follow first subject vaccination administer second dose vaccine subject . The primary objective study : determine dose-related safety subvirion inactivate H7N7 vaccine healthy adult ; determine dose-related immunogenicity subvirion inactivate H7N7 vaccine healthy adult approximately 1 month follow receipt 2 dos vaccine ; provide information selection best dose level study . The secondary objective evaluate dose-related immunogenicity percent subject respond approximately 1 7 month first vaccination . The primary endpoint : adverse event ( AE ) serious adverse event ( SAE ) information ( solicit in-clinic via memory aid , concomitant medication , periodic targeted physical assessment ) ; proportion subject dose group achieve serum neutralize antibody titer great equal 40 influenza A/H7N7 virus 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ( approximately Day 56 ) ; geometric mean titer ( GMT ) frequency 4-fold great increase neutralize antibody titer group 1 month receipt dose , 7 month receipt first dose vaccine ; GMT frequency 4-fold great increase serum hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) antibody titer group 1 month receipt dose , 7 month receipt first dose vaccine . Participants involve study related procedure approximately 7 month . This study link DMID protocol 07-0060 .</detailed_description>
