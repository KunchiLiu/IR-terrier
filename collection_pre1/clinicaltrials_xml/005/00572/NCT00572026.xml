Stimulant treatment immediate-release methylphenidate ( IR MPH ) demonstrate improve driving performance adolescent ADHD . Hypothesis Tested : - Main study : Just stimulant medication improve simulation on-road driving performance ADHD teenager , hypothesize stimulant medication improve routine driving performance . - Substudy - Extended wear ( 15 hour ) Daytrana lead safer drive late evening ( 22:00 01:00 ) , dangerous drive mishap likely occur , next morning 09:00 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Driving collision lead cause death among adolescent , account 15 teenage death per day United States . ( National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 2003 ) . Driving fatality significantly likely occur distract teenage passenger automobile ( Insurance Institute Highway Safety 2000 ) . Fatalities also likely occur evening , weekend , summer month ( National Center Statistics Analysis 2005 ) . Among child , attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) associate increase risk accident , especially bicycle pedestrian ( Leibson 2001 ; Jensen 1988 ; DiScala 1998 ) . Anywhere 40 % 80 % child diagnose ADHD continue display symptom disorder adolescence ( Barkley 1990 ; Gittelman 1985 ) . Adolescents ADHD also increase risk driving-related accident , 2 4 time likely experience motor vehicle accident ( Barkley 1993 ; Barkley 1996 ; Cox 2000 ) , 4 time likely fault accident ( Barkley 1993 ) , 3 time likely incur associate injury result accident ( Murphy 1996 ) . Stimulant treatment immediate-release methylphenidate ( IR MPH ) demonstrate improve driving performance adolescent ADHD . Simulated drive performance assess 1.5 2 hour post-dose double-blind , crossover study compare effect one 10-mg dose immediate-release methylphenidate ( IR MPH ) placebo male subject ADHD ( age 19-25 year ) match control without ADHD ( Cox 2000 ) . When placebo administer group , ADHD-diagnosed participant demonstrate significantly poor drive score control ( P &lt; 0.05 ) ; however , 1.5 hour administration IR MPH , drive performance ADHD-diagnosed group significantly improve ( P &lt; 0.05 ) equivalent control group . To determine whether difference pharmacokinetic profile IR extended-release MPH formulation influence drive performance throughout day , study conduct compare IR MPH dose 3 time daily ( tid ) once-daily , OROS® MPH ( CONCERTA® ) ( Cox 2004a ) . OROS MPH delivers MPH via osmotic pump produce ascend profile duration treatment effect 12 hour ( Swanson 2003 ) . Once-daily dose OROS MPH similar IR MPH dose tid minimizes fluctuation peak trough plasma concentration associate MPH dose tid ( Swanson 2003 ) . Therefore , crossover study design , OROS MPH administer 8:00 AM , IR MPH administer tid 8:00 AM , 12:00 PM , 4:00 PM . The driving performance adolescent ADHD age 16 19 year assess use drive simulator 2:00 , 5:00 , 8:00 11:00 PM . When subject administer IR MPH , simulate drive performance worsen factor 5 8:00 PM 11:00 PM , drive performance subject receive OROS MPH remain stable 2:00 PM 11:00 PM . Not drive performance significantly well subject receive OROS MPH ( P &lt; 0.001 ) , subject treat OROS MPH demonstrate significantly less variability driving performance ( P &lt; 0.001 ) . In subsequent study compare drive skill subject receive receive medication , adolescent ADHD drove car standard road course either take OROS MPH 8:00 AM receive medication . ( Cox 2004b ) Raters , blind medication condition , observe significantly few inattentive driving error adolescent take OROS MPH ( P &lt; 0.01 ) . The study demonstrate reduction inattentive error positively correlate ( r=0.60 , P &lt; 0.01 ) mg/kg dose OROS MPH . Given evidence stimulant therapy MPH improve drive performance once-daily OROS MPH improve drive performance effective evening compare IR formulation , recently study effect 2 long-acting stimulant formulations—once-daily OROS MPH mixed amphetamine salt extend release ( se AMPH ER , ADDERALL® XR ) —on simulate drive performance adolescent ADHD compare affect adolescent driving performance . This study indicate medication improve driving performance neuropsychological functioning relative placebo , generally OROS MPH ( Concerta ) lead great improvement . However , individual difference minority subject perform well take se AMPH ER ( Adderall XR ) .</detailed_description>
