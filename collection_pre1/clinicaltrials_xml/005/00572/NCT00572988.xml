	<brief_summary>The major purpose experimental study test effect symptom management home care nurse intervention ( SMHCNI ) recovery outcomes elderly CABG patient , use randomize , two group ( n=284 ) repeat measure design measurement discharge , 3 6 week , 3 6 month postoperatively . One group receive intervention routine care ( RC ) group receive RC . The major aim determine intervention group demonstrate : well physiological functioning ( decreased symptom interference physical functioning ; good score SF36 subscales : physical , role-physical vitality , increased activity exercise energy expenditure ) ; well psychosocial functioning ( decreased symptom interference enjoyment life ; good SF36 subscales ; role-emotional , social , mental , vitality ) ; few postoperative problem ( e.g . infection , fluid lung , heart rate rhythm problem ) . Additional outcome secondary aim : low level health care utilization ( HCU ) ( i.e. , few number visit health care provider , few number emergency department visit , few number home health visit , few rehospitalizations ) ; high patient satisfaction ( level function care receive ) .

The major purpose experimental study test effect symptom management home care nurse intervention ( SMHCNI ) recovery outcomes elderly CABG patient use randomize , two group ( N=284 ) repeat measure design measurement discharge , 3 6 week , 3 6 month post- operatively . One group receive intervention routine care ( RC ) group receive RC . The major aim determine intervention group demonstrate : well physiological functioning ( decreased symptom interference physical functioning ( decreased symptom interference physical functioning ; good score SF 36 subscales : physical , role-physical vitality , increased activity exercise energy expenditure ) ; well physiological conditioning ( decreased symptom interference physical functioning ; good score SF 36 subscales ; role-emotional , social , mental , vitality ) ; few post-operative problem ( e.g. , infection , fluid lung , heart rate rhythm problem ) .
