	<detailed_description>Glaucoma progressive optic neuropathy lead cause blindness United States1 . In glaucoma , vision lose apoptosis ( program cell death ) retinal ganglion cell , type cell retina transmit visual information brain . Diagnosis glaucoma usually base combination progressive , characteristic vision loss ( measure use visual field test ) progressive optic nerve head damage ( detect dilate fundus examination disc photography ) . While high pressure inside eye ( ocular hypertension , OHT ) sufficient diagnosis glaucoma , great single risk factor disease onset.27 Currently , effective treatment prevent disease progression lower intraocular pressure ( IOP ) 2 . IOP determine balance aqueous production ( flow ) aqueous outflow either trabecular meshwork uveoscleral pathway . Diurnal rhythms aqueous humor dynamic nocturnal fluctuation IOP aqueous flow study detail9 little know nocturnal rhythm aqueous humor outflow . Usually , clinical IOP measurement perform day ; little known nocturnal IOP fluctuation relation glaucoma management 3 . A recent surge interest nocturnal IOPs stem hypothesis significant glaucomatous damage may occur night4,5 . In response , investigator advocate particular class glaucoma medication base nocturnal IOP effects6-8 . The efficacious drug market may prefer treatment ineffective night . Therefore , understand nighttime IOP aqueous humor dynamic control important scientific , clinical , commercial implication . Additionally , previous research glaucoma medication limited effect ocular hypotensive drug 24-hour IOP daytime aqueous humor dynamic ; study address effect nocturnal aqueous humor dynamic . Beta-blockers proven effective lower IOP day decrease aqueous flow10 . However , limitation find IOP-lowering effect overnight11 . Prostaglandins , increase uveoscleral outflow12 , seem possess hypotensive effect constant throughout 24-hour period11 . Dorzolamide reduce aqueous flow lower IOP study address effect night13 . This study design elucidate physiological mechanism drive efficacy drug throughout 24-hour period , i.e . circadian rhythm aqueous humor dynamic . In study new glaucoma medication prefer study population include ocular hypertensive subject . These people high IOP optic nerve damage glaucoma . They may take prescribed IOP lower drug condition may . Those take ocular drug ask stop taking . Since glaucoma drug affect aqueous humor dynamic different way , essential residual medical effect remain drug . Standard washout period 6-weeks utilized drug assessment . This period time base method publish study determine necessary period 4-8 week ocular washout prostaglandin . A concern patient safety exists OHT patient take glaucoma medication , IOP may rise washout . In order monitor IOP patient , study method utilize biweekly check IOP . If pressure rise ophthalmologist 's preset `` target pressure '' point , patient remove study return previous medical regimen.18-26</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must nineteen ( 19 ) year age old . Subjects must able willing give write informed consent [ i.e. , subject give ample time read ( read ) consent form , ask question may regard study , clear understanding study well procedures involve , prior sign consent form ] . Subjects must exhibit willingness comply protocol investigator 's instruction . Subjects must previously diagnose unilateral bilateral ocular hypertension least six month prior screen visit . Subjects must exhibit baseline IOPs 21 35 mmHg ( inclusive ) ; average IOP eye must ≤ 5 mmHg Subjects age match ocular hypotensive subject Subjects must exhibit baseline IOPs 12 20 mmHg ( inclusive ) ; average IOP eye must ≤ 5 mmHg Age less nineteen year old . Women pregnant , lactate childbearing potential use highly effective birth control measure . Aphakia pseudophakia Best correct visual acuity worse 20/60 either eye . Chronic recurrent severe ocular inflammatory disease . Ocular infection inflammation within three ( 3 ) month screen visit . History clinically significant progressive retinal disease retinal degeneration , diabetic retinopathy retinal detachment . Any abnormality prevent reliable tonometry either eye . Previous exposure : betaadrenergic antagonist , topical prostaglandin analogue ( include latanoprost , unoprostone , travoprost bimatoprost ) within six ( 6 ) week baseline visit ; αadrenergic agonist within two ( 2 ) week baseline visit ; cholinergic agonist carbonic anhydrase inhibitor within five ( 5 ) day treatment initiation visit History severe ocular pathology ( include severe dry eye ) would preclude administration topical beta blocker , carbonic anhydrase inhibitor , topical prostaglandin . Any eye cuptodisc ratio great 0.8 . History intraocular surgery . History ocular laser surgery . History severe serious hypersensitivity topical systemic beta blocker , prostaglandin , sulfa drug . History severe , unstable uncontrolled cardiovascular , hepatic renal disease . History bronchial asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Less one month ( prior baseline ) stable dose regimen nonglaucoma medication would affect IOP . Gonioscopy angle &lt; 2 . Inability dose treatment medication . Inability discontinue contact lens wear . Therapy investigational agent within 30 day screen . Use additional topical systemic adjunctive ocular hypotensive medication study .
