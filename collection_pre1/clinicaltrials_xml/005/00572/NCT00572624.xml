	<brief_summary>Obesity one widespread health problem today , 61 million adult Americans consider obese . Abdominal obesity ( AO ) , particular , associate increase chance cardiac disease , coronary artery disease , relate risk factor , high blood pressure type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . Despite know association AO cardiac disease , mechanisms responsible relationship still well understood . Recent obesity study indicate increased delivery fat heart may play role heart function impairment . This study evaluate impact AO human heart 's use fat energy heart function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Abdominal Obesity Heart Metabolism Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity define high amount excess body fat . Millions people worldwide meet criterion obesity , make one press current health issue . The body fat person , susceptible person number life threaten disease , include heart disease , type 2 diabetes , gallstone , certain cancer , high blood pressure . A variety factor lead obesity . These factor include family history genetics , physical inactivity , metabolism , hormone imbalance , environment . Past research suggest increase availability fat body lead increase fat uptake heart . The heart need certain amount fat energy , leave remain fat heart tissue , possibly impair proper heart function . However , information mechanism behind effect fat heart metabolism need . This study evaluate impact AO human heart 's use fat energy heart function . This study enroll overweight lean participant attend 4 7 study visit . Visit 1 consist various screen test , include medical history , physical exam , pregnancy test applicable , routine blood test , echocardiogram ( ECHO ) perform exercise . Visit 2 consist abdominal fat insulin sensitivity study . This entail magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) test image heart stomach , dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan measure total body fat muscle content , insulin sensitivity test measure well hormone insulin control blood sugar . The latter test require multiple blood draws 3-hour period . Visits 3 4 occur 2-week period . Both visit consist overnight stay General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) follow day image study . During Visit 3 , participant first undergo 4-hour whole body metabolism study , include injection nonradioactive tracer previously place IVs , blood draw , breathe machine approximately 15 minute . Participants undergo positron emission tomographic ( PET ) heart metabolism study , also involve tracer injection blood draw . A rest ECHO test also do PET study . Participants ask permission store sample blood period 10 year use future research study heart . During Visit 4 , participant undergo repeat test third visit , except PET study evaluate heart 's ability use sugar instead fat . This complete study visit lean participant overweight participant entail 4 week participation . Overweight participant may ask attend additional three study visit 8-month weight management program Washington University School Medicine . Participants aim lose 10 % body weight 6-month period maintain weight loss another 1- 2-month stabilization period . At end stabilization period , participant undergo repeat abdominal fat insulin sensitivity study Visit 5 , repeat whole body metabolism heart metabolism study Visit 6 , repeat whole body metabolism glucose heart metabolism study Visit 7 .</detailed_description>
