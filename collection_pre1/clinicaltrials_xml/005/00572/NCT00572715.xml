	<brief_summary>Our first aim describe common sudden decrease renal function happen infant neonatal intensive care unit . We also want see sudden loss renal function affect survival . Finally , explore non-invasive marker identify sudden decrease renal function urinary sample .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Kidney Injury Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advancements field peri-natal medicine improve survival critically ill neonate yet many still survive , many leave long-term damage vital organ system . Very little data available impact acute kidney injury ( AKI ) survival term neonate , adult pediatric study show even mild AKI independently impact survival correct severity illness . The role AKI impact survival neonate likely great adult acute injury occur context impaired ongoing kidney development . Our ability improve outcome child adult AKI hamper inability recognize AKI early disease process . Thus , work early non-invasive biomarkers renal injury bring great optimism field AKI . Serum urinary level neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) , urinary interleukin 18 ( IL-18 ) others markedly elevate several hour AKI oppose serum creatinine take day rise inciting event . Early non-invasive biomarkers AKI test neonate . Inclusion criterion - Families infant ( birthweight &gt; 1500g ) ask participate study . Exclusion criterion - Infants prenatal renal ultrasound diagnosis severe hydronephrosis know renal abnormality exclude</detailed_description>
