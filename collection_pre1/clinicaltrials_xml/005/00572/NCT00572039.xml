	<brief_summary>This randomize , control clinical trial test efficacy Problem-Solving Treatment ( PST ) improve vision function old person age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . AMD highly prevalent , disable disease age cause severe vision loss functional decline . It lead cause blindness old person United States may affect 10 million people . Currently , effective treatment restore vision . Thus , improve Vision Function major goal treatment . Vision function refers vision-related ability perform daily living activity ( e.g . read recipe prepare meal ) . Decrements vision function become major public health problem population age prevalence AMD increase . PST brief , standardize , cognitive-behavioral treatment teach problem-solving skill . We believe PST enable patient AMD find practical solution vision-related problem thereby improve vision function . We recruit 240 AMD patient retina clinic Wills Eye Institute , Philadelphia , PA , bilateral AMD visual acuity worse 20/70 good eye . PST-trained therapist deliver 6 1-hour , in-home session 120 subject randomize PST . The control treatment Supportive Therapy ( ST ) , similarly structure , standardized psychological treatment control non-specific effect treatment ( n=120 ) . ST contain active element beyond non-specific component ; way placebo treatment . Independent raters , mask treatment assignment , assess Targeted Vision Function ( primary outcome ) vision-related quality life ( secondary outcome ) 3 month ass PST 's efficacy , 6 month evaluate long-term effect . As population age , disability AMD become prevalent , costly , burdensome patient , family , ophthalmologist . This make devise test practical affordable intervention improve vision function national priority .</brief_summary>
