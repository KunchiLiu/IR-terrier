	<detailed_description>Hypothesis Specific Aims Hypothesis : A significant proportion autistic child impaired methylation antioxidant/detoxification capacity result chronic oxidative stress . Targeted nutritional intervention design correct metabolic imbalance significantly improve metabolic profile improve measure autistic behavior . If proven correct , hypothesis could generate specific biomarkers define individual behavioral phenotype within autism spectrum indicate target treatment option reduce possibly prevent clinical behavioral manifestation autism . Specific Aim 1 . To screen child diagnosis autism evidence impaired methylation ( ↓SAM/SAH ) impair antioxidant capacity ( ↓GSH/GSSG ) Specific Aim 2 . Children exhibit evidence impair methylation antioxidant capacity randomize double blind placebo-controlled parallel group trial target nutritional intervention design correct metabolic deficiency imbalance improve score standardize behavioral evaluation test . The two specific aim ( Study Phase 1 2 respectively ) design increase understand metabolic factor contribute development clinical manifestation autism . We anticipate knowledge gain successful achievement aim provide important new metabolic dimension early diagnosis clinical management autistic child . Rationale : Although efficacy nutritional intervention autistic child evaluate numerous report literature , study generally consider inconclusive . Despite positive result , criticize small sample size , poor study design , lack placebo group , heterogeneity diagnosis , and/or efficacy base subjective parent report . Because limitation , none study successfully demonstrate targeted nutritional supplementation efficacious treatment approach autistic child . Consequently , real need large well-designed placebo-controlled study intervention strategy base metabolic nutritional endpoint follow treatment efficacy related quantitative improvement standardized behavioral testing conduct blind manner . While knowledge individual nutrient response efficacy desirable goal , reality metabolic pathways inextricably interwoven interdependent perturbation one pathway inevitably affect pathway . This mean address deficit one single pathway highly likely alter requirement possibly negatively affect interdependent pathway . A broad spectrum balance approach correct observe metabolic imbalance autistic child basis intervention strategy propose present intervention trial . Because efficacy nutritional intervention autistic child base solely anecdotal evidence , placebo-controlled double blind study clearly need establish scientifically carefully design clinical trial whether approach efficacy whether . Either outcome provide valuable information parent physicians currently recommend supplement . If outcome indicate therapeutic efficacy , information publish scientific literature mainstream medicine aware approach . If outcome indicate lack efficacy , dissemination information important prevent needless waste monetary resource . Targeted Metabolic Therapy Abnormalities folate , methionine glutathione metabolism directly indirectly affect phospholipid metabolism , mitochondrial energy metabolism , detoxification/antioxidant capacity , mineral cofactor availability . Therefore , correction imbalance folate/methionine glutathione metabolism require global targeted nutritional intervention strategy rather isolate single nutrient supplementation . A nutritionally balance diet consist fruit , vegetable meat encourage . Although helpful , diet-only approach generally consider insufficient overcome genetically-based chronic metabolic imbalance . Further , control nutrient intake individual child impossible diet-only intervention may complicate sensory issue restrict dietary preference autistic child . Therefore , design balance targeted supplementation strategy specifically design support correct observe metabolic imbalance autistic child . Based consideration extensive literature review , supplement select impact three core cellular function may impair chronic oxidative stress many child autism : 1 . Decreased SAM/SAH ratio cellular methylation capacity : methionine synthase reaction SAM synthesis redox sensitive inactivate low GSH oxidative stress . 40-43 2 . Cell membrane integrity : membrane lipid peroxidation occur oxidative stress evidence elevate isoprostanes autistic children.24,44,45 3 . Antioxidant detoxification support ( mitochondrial cytosolic ) : Glutathione level redox ratio significantly reduce many autistic children.1,42,46 The selection supplement dose level make consultation Bryan Jepson MD , recently publish book entitle `` Changing course autism : scientific approach parent physician '' ( available IRB upon request ) . Dr. Jepson parent autistic child physician treat hundred autistic child autism practice Austin , Texas . The supplement highly unlikely produce toxic side effect base previous publish study scientific literature show efficacy child without toxic side effect . We create table ( submit approve IRB ) indicate micronutrient , supplement level fall IOM designate safe upper limit . The table also allow comparison safe upper limit study dose micronutrient provide quote scientific literature indicate intake supplement level show non-toxic . Stephen Kahler MD , clinical geneticist member research team , PCP consultant , Bryan Jepson MD , agree level safe likely efficacious . Indeed , supplement level commonly prescribe PCPs currently treat thousand autistic child without report toxic side effect . Finally , consult locally Donald Mock , MD PhD , also express confidence safety recommend supplement dose level . The selected supplement available over-the counter ( OTC ) consider FDA GRAS ( generally recognize safe ) fall safety regulation DSHEA Act ( Dietary Supplement Health Education Act ) . We choose obtain supplement highly reputable compound pharmacy , Kirkman Laboratories avoid additive food dye often present OTC supplement may cause negative side effect autistic child . Kirkman Laboratories manufacture prescription drug nutritional supplement since 1949 use Standard Operating Procedures require FDA ( FDA registration 3025062 ) . Their manufacturing process base `` Good Manufacturing Practices '' define FDA monitor independent quality control department . Our research team strengthen continued participation ACH Research Pharmacist , work closely Kirkman Laboratories . The ACH Research Pharmacist receive distribute supplements/placebos assure proper storage condition open label study , Protocol # 28839 . Behavioral Tests : Each test choose base recommendation consultant certify behavioral analyst , Doreen Granpesheh PhD . These test deem likely detect change treatment intervention appropriate ( e.g. , ADOS ) administer ACH Pediatric Psychologists . The ADOS behavior test videotape . A second behavior analyst evaluate random set video recording confirm inter-rater reliability . Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( ADOS ) `` gold standard '' assess diagnose autism pervasive developmental disorder ( PDD ) across age , developmental level , language skill . Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales ( VABS ) provide age-adjusted overall autism severity score individual score regressive/expressive verbal non-verbal communication , fine gross motor skill , interpersonal behavior . The Social Responsiveness Scale ( SRS ) distinguish autism spectrum condition child psychiatric condition identify presence extent autistic social impairment .Completed parent SRS provide clear picture child 's social impairment , assess social awareness , social information processing , capacity reciprocal social communication , social anxiety/avoidance autistic preoccupation trait . Preschool Language Scale Fourth Edition ( PLS-4 ) standardize test auditory comprehension expressive communication infant toddler . The auditory comprehension subscale assess basic vocabulary , concept grammatical marker preschool higher-level ability complex sentence , make comparison inference old child . The expressive communication subscale ask preschooler name object , use concept describe object , express quantity , use grammatical marker , etc . It also include word segmentation , complete analogy , tell short story sequence . The Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) tool use pick subtle behavior change may catch behavior test . The CGI 3 item observer rat scale measure illness severity , global improvement change , therapeutic response . This tool widely available use public domain . For study , Pediatric Psychologists use illness severity global improvement section tool . The Block Food Frequency Questionnaire , Child 's Sleep Habits Questionnaire , GI Symptom Inventory , Pediatric Quality Life Questionnaire ( PQOL ) , Parental Stress Index ( PSI ) complete parent ( ) assistance study nurse . Supplement Doses , Formulation Administration Targeted metabolic support base metabolic evidence oxidative stress and/or impaired methylation capacity . The supplement form methyl B12 pre-loaded syrinx ( previously approve UAMS IRB [ protocol # 28839 ] FDA [ IND # 71459 ] ) , small capsule ( folinic acid carnitine ) , powder ( mineral antioxidant ) , liquid ( cod liver oil essential fatty acid ) . The placebo ( cellulose ) prepare identical form Kirkman Laboratories . The Methyl B12 pre-loaded syrinx placebos prepared identical form Custom Compounding Pharmacy The rationale dose schedule supplement base establish efficacy follow category : 1 .
