	<brief_title>Energy Costs Spasticity Spinal Cord Injury : A Pilot Investigation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity epidemic proportion population spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , likely mediator metabolic syndrome special population . Recent literature review suggest obesity present &gt; 67 % person SCI . Additionally , recent study demonstrate causal relationship adipose tissue accumulation vascular inflammation , dyslipidemia , insulin resistance / glucose intolerance , hypertension thromboemboli . Obesity SCI occur acute ongoing positive energy balance , i.e. , great caloric intake energy expenditure . Total Daily Energy Expenditure ( TDEE ) SCI reduce primarily muscular atrophy diminish muscular contraction ; pharmacological treatment spasticity possibly reduce energy expenditure ( EE ) even , evaluate date . TDEE comprise three component : Basal Energy Expenditure ( BEE ) , Thermic Effect Activity ( TEA ) Thermic Effect Food ( TEF ) . Of three , BEE contribute great amount ( 65-75 % TDEE ) sensitive change spasticity . Dampening spasticity report increase weight gain necessitate reduce caloric intake child spastic quadriplegia . Similarly , athetosis patient cerebral palsy increase rest metabolic rate ( RMR ) compare control subject athetotic movement . Although several study report energy requirement person neurodevelopmental disability , even SCI , however , none attempt measure metabolic effect spasticity .</detailed_description>
