	<brief_summary>Multidrug resistance ( MDR ) cause treatment failure many cancer patient . MDR refers phenotype whereby tumor resistant large number natural chemotherapeutic drug . Having prior knowledge presence resistance would decrease morbidity unsuccessful therapy allow selection individual may benefit co-administration MDR inhibiting drug . The Tc-99m label single photon emit radiotracers sestamibi tetrofosmin show predictive value . However , positron-emitting ( PET ) radiotracers , allow dynamic , quantitative imaging , hold promise accurate specific identification MDR tumor . Objective : To obtain human safety data , demonstrate imaging feasibility FPAC , obtain human biodistribution obtain preliminary evidence breast tumor uptake concordance response therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study 18F Fluoropaclitaxel ( FPAC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>18F flouropaclitaxel ( FPAC ) distribution malignant tumor expect similar paclitaxel . It propose monitor influx efflux FPAC vivo use PET imaging , able determine tumor retain drug ( drug sensitive ) pump ( drug resistant ) . The efflux rate FPAC tumor proportional amount Pgp present therefore predictor treatment failure . If method successful identify MDR , patient spar course ineffective chemotherapy start alternative drug , available , effective MDR modulator administer prior treatment . In order validate biodistribution non-human primate , 3 normal volunteer recruit participate dosimetry PET image protocol . Often , patient breast cancer treat chemotherapy prior definitive surgical removal primary tumor . Three patient breast cancer candidate neoadjuvant chemotherapy also recruit participate study , order demonstrate feasibility tumor image . As patient receive chemotherapy ( likely paclitaxel ) , preliminary correlation FPAC uptake tumor response also attempt pilot study . Primary Objective -- To obtain human dosimetry monitor potential physiologic effect follow 4- [ F-18 ] fluoropaclitaxel ( FPAC ) administration Secondary Objectives - a.To characterize tracer uptake tumor normal tissue develop robust method analysis FPAC kinetics breast tumor - b.To optimize image protocol FPAC , , feasible , reduce 1 2 static scan</detailed_description>
