	<brief_summary>We interest determine exist short-term response serum marker hormones participate regulation bone tissue formation breakdown single , high-intensity exercise session weight lift ( resistance exercise ) jumping ( plyometrics ) . We also interest determine bone marker response exercise alter change negative energy state cause exercise treatment , subject give moderate calorie meal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hormonal Bone Turnover Marker Response Acute Bout Resistance Plyometric Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bone tissue respond impact strain force , like high-intensity exercise , upregulating bone remold process , result deposition calcium phosphate mineral collagen matrix bone . Bone remodel continually active process involve activation cell regulate bone formation ( osteoblast ) resorption ( osteoclast ) . Alterations balance formation resorption critical change bone density mineral content occur , regulate several hormone include vitamin D growth hormone , sex hormone estrogen testosterone , parathyroid hormone . Importantly , remain unclear single bout physical activity contribute overall change remodel whether acute alteration detect hour exercise . Additionally , research study examine effect exercise bone remodel often draw blood sample 24 hour physical inactivity , potentially diminish magnitude exercise response . Therefore , plan evaluate acute effect plyometrics resistance exercise change serum hormone marker bone turnover non-sedentary , healthy male , without moderate calorie supplement .</detailed_description>
