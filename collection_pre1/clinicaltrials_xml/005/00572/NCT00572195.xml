	<detailed_description>NeuroPace , Inc. sponsor investigational device study RNS® System , first close loop responsive brain stimulator design treat refractory epilepsy . The RNS® System LTT study open-label multi-center prospective 7-year clinical investigation follow completion RNS® System Pivotal Feasibility study . Data regard safety efficacy collect 6-month interval , data regard quality life collect yearly interval . The study design assess ongoing safety evaluate long-term efficacy RNS® System adjunctive therapy reduce frequency medically uncontrolled disable partial onset seizure start one two area brain . The RNS® System LTT study provide additional data safety efficacy RNS® System 7 year follow subject 's completion RNS® System Feasibility Pivotal study . Data RNS® System LTT study combine data collect RNS® System Feasibility Pivotal study , result 9 total year post-implant follow-up data . These data use calculate long-term SAE rate , percent change seizure frequency ( pre-implant baseline ) , well frequency sudden unexplained death epilepsy ( SUDEP ) . The RNS® Neurostimulator ( pacemaker-like device ) NeuroPace® Leads ( tiny wire electrode ) implant head . The Neurostimulator battery power , microprocessor control device detects store record electrographic pattern ( epileptiform , seizure-like , activity ) Leads within brain . When device detects electrographic pattern , respond send electrical stimulation Leads small part patient 's brain interrupt electrographic pattern . This type treatment call responsive stimulation , yet know work treatment epilepsy . Direct brain stimulation therapy already receive approval United States , Europe , Canada , Australia treatment Essential Tremor Parkinson 's disease . Direct brain stimulation approve treatment epilepsy .</detailed_description>
