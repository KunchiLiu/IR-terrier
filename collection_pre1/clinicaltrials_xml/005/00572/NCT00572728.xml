	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well 3'-deoxy-3'-18F fluorothymidine ( 18F-FLT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) work predict response patient receive chemotherapy undergo surgery breast cancer spread start nearby tissue lymph node . Diagnostic procedure , 18F-FLT PET/CT , may help learn well chemotherapy work kill breast cancer cell surgery help doctor plan best treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Fluorine-18 3'-Deoxy-3'-Fluorothymidine ( F-18-FLT ) Invasive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate percentage change standardize uptake value 60 minute ( SUV60 ) baseline ( FLT-1 ) early-therapy ( FLT-2 ) pathologic complete response neoadjuvant chemotherapy primary tumor patient locally advance breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To demonstrate correlation FLT-1 post-therapy ( FLT-3 ) uptake parameter tumor proliferation marker locally advance breast cancer . II . To evaluate relationship FLT-1 , FLT-2 FLT-3 uptake parameter pathologic complete response primary tumor residual cancer burden ( RCB ) . III . To evaluate relationship FLT-1 , FLT-2 FLT-3 uptake parameter non-response primary tumor ( stable progressive disease ) therapy . IV . To evaluate relationship FLT-1 , FLT-2 FLT-3 uptake parameter pathologic complete response neoadjuvant chemotherapy patient regional disease lymph node patient locally advance breast cancer . V. To compare change FLT-2 FLT-3 uptake parameter change tumor size serial image modality mammogram , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , ultrasound . VI . To compare change FLT-2 FLT-3 uptake parameter metabolic change [ 18F ] fludeoxyglucose ( FDG ) -PET , available . VII . To continue monitor potential safety issue define physiologic effect associate 18F FLT administration . OUTLINE : Patients undergo 18F-FLT PET/CT baseline ( prior chemotherapy , FLT-1 ) , early therapy ( 5-10 day initiation first course chemotherapy , FLT-2 ) , post therapy ( within 3 week prior surgery , FLT-3 ) . Patients undergo standard surgical resection residual tumor follow completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
