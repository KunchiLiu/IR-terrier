	<brief_summary>The purpose research study apply new non-invasive , no-risk technique cardiac transplant population assessment reliability detect heart transplant rejection . Graft rejection remain major factor limit long-term survival despite continued advancement use immunosuppression . Aggressive surveillance detection acute rejection therefore necessary . Repeated endomyocardial biopsy ( EMB ) ( least 11 time first year transplantation ) remain reliable surveillance method available . EMB expensive , invasive , inconvenient patient , associate significant incidence serious complication . Therefore , would important patient care new no-risk method would prove effective surveillance rejection . This research study design measure non-invasive way assess rejection along standard plan endomyocardial biopsy heart transplantation . First , investigator plan test effectiveness investigational use CMI 2406 Magnetocardiograph approve U.S Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . While device use study FDA-approved non-invasive measurement recording heart 's magnetic field reflect heart 's electrical current , yet approve specific use detection transplant rejection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The objective study test hypothesis : 1 . Tissue Doppler Imaging , Real time 3D segmental volume measurement , Magnetocardiographic Imaging plus serum marker T-cell response change transplant rejection occur . 2 . Tissue Doppler Imaging , Real time 3D segmental volume measurement , Magnetocardiographic Imaging plus serum marker T-cell response remain stable rejection occur Background : General : Heart transplantation advantageous procedure select patient end-stage heart failure . All patient remain lifetime calcineurin immunosuppressive medication cyclosporine tacrolimus prevent rejection extend graft function . Currently , common practice manage patient titration immunosuppressive medication establish trough level clinical response . However , despite diligent effort balance `` adequate '' immunosuppressive level prevention end-organ toxicity opportunistic infection ; patient still experience acute rejection . Graft rejection remain major factor limit long-term survival despite continued advancement use immunosuppression . Aggressive surveillance use gold standard endomyocardial biopsy ( EMB ) detection acute rejection therefore necessary . Repeated EMB ( minimum 11 time first year heart transplantation ) remain reliable surveillance method available . EMB expensive , invasive , inconvenient patient , associate significant incidence serious complication . Hyperacute rejection occur rarely since screen recipient anti-donor antibody introduce . However , focal diffuse acute cellular rejection common diagnose EMB . The degree severity rejection grade scale 0 4 grade 3 consider severe . Most acute cellular rejection occur within first year transplant . Chronic rejection allograft arteriopathy occur later monitor coronary angiography . Echocardiogram : Echocardiograms routinely perform transplant patient . The finding increase wall thickness decrease isovolumetric relaxation time decrease compliance well decrease right ventricular ( RV ) leave ventricular ( LV ) ejection fraction may indicate rejection , parameter may normalize rejection resolve . Tissue Doppler imaging ( TDI ) measurement relatively new Doppler technique assess leave ventricular diastolic function . Selective measurement tissue contraction relaxation velocity mitral annulus detect leave ventricular dysfunction accurately conventional echocardiography . As left ventricular diastolic dysfunction early event allograft rejection , technique may useful detect rejection non-invasively . Few study show Doppler tissue image mitral annulus useful diagnose heart transplant rejection ( 1-3 ) . Real time 3-dimensional ( 3D ) echocardiography ( RT-3D ) may useful tool evaluation patient coronary artery disease , leave ventricular apical thrombus , valvular disease , guide intracardiac catheter placement mitral valvuloplasty . RT-3D , recently become widely available , provide dynamic pyramidal data structure encompass entire heart allow four-dimensional assessment cardiac anatomy function . It show technique precise determination LV volume , mass EF measurement well correlate MRI ( 4-6 ) . Mild change LV volume , LV mass function occur acute cardiac rejection . This sensitive technique assessment regional volumetric change yet use heart transplant monitoring . Magnetocardiogram : The Magnetocardiograph ( MCG ) novel image modality may provide sensitive objective mean assess alteration heart tissue . Because acute inflammatory process rejection deleteriously affect myocyte structure function , hypothesize either de- re-polarization change occur cardiac cycle subsequent change cardiac magnetic field may give altered reading affect patient time . Magnetocardiography ( MCG ) new modality utilize superconducting quantum interference device detection weak magnetic field ( picoTesla range ) generate heart 's electrical current . The magnetic field map picture , create measurement magnetic field , reflect electrophysiological state heart . When abnormality cardiac depolarization repolarization , ischemia myocarditis , reflect abnormality magnetic field map ( 7 ) . Although MCG ECG measure cardiac depolarization repolarization pattern , fundamental difference . MCG sensitive tangential current whereas ECG sensitive radial current relation chest surface ( 7-10 ) . Cardiac abnormality , interfere normal activation deactivation sequence , may occur acute rejection , increase contribution tangential current . In addition , MCG detect vortex current evident ECG . Finally , MCG less affected conductivity variation cause lung , skin , muscle skin electrode contact problem since device come direct contact skin . Therefore , MCG may able detect difference depolarization repolarization different manner high sensitivity ECG . We speculate variation magnetic field pattern due early subtle change cellular mechanism metabolism . These change create heterogeneous repolarization pattern probably cause local current appear border zone normal diseased myocardium . This imply change MCG may appear even early cascade rejection wall motion abnormality , ECG change , change serum marker troponin . Schmitz et al report sensitivity 91 % specificity 93 % detection acute rejection episodes 15 transplant patient ( 11 ) . Another study , utilize different analysis method , find sensitivity specificity 83 % 84 % , respectively diagnosis graft rejection 12 patient 6 control ( 12 ) .</detailed_description>
