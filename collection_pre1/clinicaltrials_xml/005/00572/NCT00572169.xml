	<detailed_description>It well know myeloma patient chromosome abnormality high risk disease tend aggressive respond treatment well patient without chromosome abnormality . When researcher Myeloma Institute look result Total Therapy II , find although research subject chromosome abnormality well outcomes ( many respond , long survive ) treat standard chemotherapy ; still outcomes improve significantly Total Therapy II , compare Total Therapy I . The research new study design target high-risk group individual chromosomal abnormality . However , hop group research participant - without chromosome abnormality - derive benefit change make new research study .</detailed_description>
