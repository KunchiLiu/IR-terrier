	<brief_title>Phase I Study Proteosome Inhibitor CEP 18770 Patients With Solid Tumours Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multicenter , dose-escalating study determine MTD dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) CEP 18770 , novel proteasome inhibitor . The study also characterize pharmacokinetics pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship CEP 18770 , ass safety tolerability CEP-18770 treatment well effect tumour response whenever possible . Patients treat intravenously CEP 18770 day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 21-day cycle period . Additional cycle may administer , 6 , long patient maintain performance status appear receive clinical benefit study . Safety data collect patient order determine toxicity reversibility toxicity CEP 18770 . Formal assessment perform throughout study include baseline , prior dose study medication every week , 30 day follow last dose study drug . Patients drug-related toxicity continue review resolution stabilization toxicity . Pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic parameter also assess cohort patient cycle 1 . Where applicable , tumour measurement document observed anti-tumour activity evaluate . The study follow conventional MTD design patient recruit cohort 3 patient , criterion expand 6 patient . Enrolment cohort begin require number patient prior cohort complete one 21-day cycle study drug treatment current dose level without experience DLT . Once MTD determine , additional 10 patient treat MTD explore toxicity dose , suitability Phase II study .</detailed_description>
