	<brief_summary>For unexplained reason , young premenopausal woman heart disease twice rate death compare men age . Animal experiment show stress reduce ovary function female monkey due reduction brain hormone . This stress reduce brain hormone level lead low estrogen level cause menstrual cycle become irregular , leading reduction fertility . These monkey also likely develop heart disease . In order , good understand relationship investigator would like study estrogen level premenopausal woman heart disease . Premenopausal woman recently undergo study coronary ( heart ) arteries blood hormone level measure one menstrual cycle . The investigator correlate blood hormone level coronary angiography result marker heart disease , test us noninvasive , painless ultrasound wave study thickness artery neck ( carotid artery ) . In addition blood cholesterol level , blood sugar level blood test show correlate heart disease measure . Another aim study evaluate potential link environmental stress hormone level . Each patient give multiple questionnaire evaluate stress , anxiety depression investigator measure stress hormone ( cortisol ) level saliva additional information . The result study explore possible link low estrogen level heart disease young premenopausal woman help pave way large research study define good way prevent heart disease woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims 1 . To document estrogen deficiency hypothalamic ( central brain ) origin stable trait , measure one menstrual cycle approximate thirty day apart premenopausal woman undergo angiography coronary ischemia . 2 . To document relationship estrogen deficiency , reproductive hormone environmental stress premenopausal woman . 3 . To measure prevalence angiographic coronary artery disease among premenopausal woman correlate noninvasive marker coronary artery disease genetic relationship estrogen cardiovascular disease genotyping analysis gene relate estrogen metabolism pathway . We recruit female patient undergone coronary angiography age 55 . After subject sign informed consent , screen test blood two hormone see subject premenopausal . If , enrol study schedule return baseline visit day 12-18 follow menstrual cycle 22-30 day later . During baseline visit measure height , weight , blood pressure , heart rate waist-hip ratio . Subject fast draw blood cholesterol , glucose insulin level level various hormone , include limited estrogen . Subject 's saliva collect test cortisol level . If subject agrees , tablespoon blood also collect genetic testing . Subject ask fill separate consent form . Participation study mandate participation genetic testing . Subject also give multiple questionnaire include question regard medical history , family history , medication use , stress , anxiety , depression . They fill within 48 hour blood draw correlate finding . Neck artery examine ultrasound wave measure thickness artery . This test perform second third visit . The final exit visit time 26-33 day baseline visit . It include test subject underwent baseline visit except ultrasound , do . In summary , subject make three four visit , total study duration three four month . We evaluate hormone level blood marker respect coronary angiogram thickness neck artery . We also assess whether hormone level relate stress , anxiety depression . And finally , measure variability hormone level test period .</detailed_description>
