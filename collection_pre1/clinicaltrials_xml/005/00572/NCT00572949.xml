	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate good way diagnose heart artery disease , heart attack damage heart muscle early . Currently , often take several hour admission lab test show damage heart muscle . Although standard electrocardiogram quick non-painful may miss many case significant coronary heart disease . The investigator propose new entirely non-contact tool , Magnetocardiograph ( MCG ) , high accuracy able predict presence significant coronary heart disease early study become positive . The investigator hope investigator develop algorithm good triage management patient chest pain . This research study design test effectiveness investigational use Magnetocardiograph ( MCG ) approve U.S Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . While MCG use study FDA-approved tool non-contact measurement display magnetic field heart generate electrical current , yet approve specific diagnosis heart artery disease ( ischemia ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetocardiography ( MCG ) Diagnosis Chest Pain Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiomagnetism refers detection , analysis interpretation magnetic field generate electrical activity heart . The peak value magnetic field heart million time small Earth 's magnetic field . A major breakthrough capability measure small field come invention SQUID ( superconducting quantum interference device ) late sixty . The first magnetocardiograms ( MCGs ) measure SQUID record Cohen et al . 1970 ( 1 ) . These early measurement perform expensive magnetically shield room , initially utilize one two SQUID probe . In eighty technology test several laboratory create magnetic field map move one SQUID sequentially chest create image whole heart magnetic field . These map attempt correlated various pathology ( 2,3 ) . Since technology greatly improve several multichannel machine use across world research purpose arrhythmia localization ischemia detection . However , present time , one company ( CardioMag Imaging ) develop machine operates outside shielded room . The CardiomagImaging ( CMI ) Magnetocardiograph ( MCG ) capable noninvasive record magnetic field arise electrical activity heart high spatial temporal resolution . The temporal trace MCG analogous ECG , , similarly , record multiple lead . This MCG device specifically develop general purpose ( outside shield room ) non-contact , non-invasive diagnostics ischemia . The CMI MCG device approve safe patient . It FDA approve noninvasive detection display heart 's magnetic field create electrical current , await FDA approval detection ischemia chest pain patient . A similar SQUID technology utilize magnetically shield room already FDA approve localization epileptic focus . When utilized matter refer MEG ( magnetoencephalogram ) . Several abstract present primarily meeting Biomagnetism , confirm safety indicate efficacy MCG detection ischemia . In particular , suggest rest MCG capable detect ischemia patient chest pain , 12-leads ECG normal ( 4,5,6 ) . However , test large prospective blind study . Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Non-invasive Cardiac Laboratory first center US evaluate CardioMag Imaging MCG clinical environment detection ischemia acute coronary syndrome patient population . Patients enrol similar protocol Johns Hopkins Medical Center , Baltimore , Mayo clinic , Rochester , Klinikum Hoyerswerda , Germany . The early detection ischemia ( Troponins become positive ) high negative positive predictive value may prove cost effective decrease risk improve prompt treatment triage high low grade monitoring time hospitalization .</detailed_description>
