	<brief_title>Multiphoton Laser Scanning Microscopy Cutaneous Optical Pathology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For skin disease , convince method diagnosis date surgical biopsy . However , skin biopsy invasive procedure carry risk tissue damage , wound infection scar formation . To solve inconvenience surgical biopsy , multiphoton laser scan microscopy develop , non-invasive method observe cutaneous anatomy pathology . Multiphoton laser scan microscopy good tissue penetration resolution less tissue damage . The study aim compare surgical specimen conventional pathology slice image non-invasive multiphoton laser scan microscopy . A good correlation multiphoton image may serve optical biopsy cutaneous pathology spare invasive procedure skin biopsy .</detailed_description>
