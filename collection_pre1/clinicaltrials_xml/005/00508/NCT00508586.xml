	<brief_summary>Formation new blood vessel ( angiogenesis ) important tumor growth metastatic breast cancer . It known tumor make protein call vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) high level VEGF tumor blood many woman metastatic breast cancer . VEGF stimulate formation blood vessel supply tumor nutrient oxygen . PTC299 oral drug show decrease production VEGF animal model human cancer . In animal model , oral PTC299 administration decrease VEGF level tumor bloodstream , decrease blood vessel number tumor , significantly slow halt tumor growth . Safety study research animal indicate good tolerability dos drug level higher plan clinical study . Results Phase 1a study healthy volunteer indicate PTC299 achieves level PTC299 bloodstream know active animal model human cancer . This Phase 1b study design test hypothesis PTC299 tolerable show evidence VEGF reduction antitumor activity administer orally combination anastrozole ( Arimidex® ) , letrozole ( Femara® ) , exemestane ( Aromasin® ) woman metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study conduct 2 stage . In Stage 1 study , successive group 3 6 patient receive progressively high PTC299 dose level ; stage , treatment give repeat 6-week cycle consist 4 week oral PTC299 twice per day follow 2-week , no-drug period . During Stage 2 , study candidate must woman natural induced suppression ovarian function post-menopausal level receive candidate hormonal therapy . These subject receive continuous administration PTC299 , 100 mg/dose BID , repeat 6-week cycle combination continuous administration one 3 hormonal agent . All plan PTC299 dose level stage expect achieve circulate blood level PTC299 know active animal model human cancer . Treatment patient continue long therapy appear safely offering tumor control patient . Up 36 evaluable patient accrue across stage .</detailed_description>
