	<brief_summary>Objective : - To evaluate efficacy use combination oxaliplatin , 5-fluorouracil , leucovorin bevacizumab ( FOLFOX-B ) patient unresectable colorectal liver metastasis , objective downstage hepatic disease enable complete resection residual disease . Primary Objective : - To evaluate resection rate patient initially unresectable hepatic colorectal metastasis downstaged FOLFOX-B . Complete resection liver lesion goal . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate probability complete response , partial response stable disease . - To evaluate proportion patient resect , proportion patient achieve R0 resection ( among receive surgery ) . - To correlate survival downstaging resection base metastatic colorectal prognostic score . - To evaluate disease-free survival overall survival . - To evaluate positron emission tomography response rate . - To explore correlation clinical response telomerase hTERT expression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oxaliplatin bevacizumab chemotherapy drug design kill cancer cell . 5-FU chemotherapy drug help stop growth cancer cell . Leucovorin drug may help increase effect 5-FU . The study drug give outpatient basis involve minimum 4 cycle maximum 12 cycle chemotherapy . All chemotherapy give catheter place vein shoulder `` cycle '' . Each `` cycle '' equal 14 day . On first day ( Day 1 ) cycle , bevacizumab give 30 90 minute oxaliplatin leucovorin 2 hour . On Day 1 well , part total 5-FU dose give 15 minute catheter . The rest 5-FU dose give pump next 46 hour . After 46 hour , rest period , without drug treatment rest cycle start next cycle . Before chemotherapy cycle , blood drawn ( 2 tablespoon ) test check side effect . Depending result blood test , blood test may do often . You also vital sign ( blood pressure , breathing , temperature , heart rate ) monitor treatment . You see every 2 week one doctor therapy . If time disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study . After completion 4th cycle chemotherapy , complete physical exam routine blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) . You also CT scan abdomen pelvis chest x-ray CT scan chest . These test do find tumor remove surgery . If tumor remove time , continue receive dose chemotherapy test maximum 12 cycle . If find tumor still remove 12 cycle , participation study complete doctor discus treatment option . If tumor remove , receive 1 additional cycle oxaliplatin , leucovorin , 5-FU ( bevacizumab ) dose go surgery . Your surgery schedule 8-12 week completion chemotherapy . The surgeon explain surgery risk . During liver tumor surgery , normal tissue around edge tumor collected part routine care . You ask sign separate consent form surgery . Additional routine blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) PET scan do surgery . If tumor remove , around 28 day surgery , give 8 additional cycle bevacizumab give way surgery . Around 4-6 week final chemotherapy treatment , follow-up CT scan abdomen pelvis , chest x-ray CT scan chest , routine blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) . These test repeat every 3 month first 3 year surgery , every 6 month 4th 5th year surgery , year rest life . PET scan do year check status disease . This investigational study . Oxaliplatin , 5-FU , leucovorin , bevacizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment disease . However , use together study investigational . Up 42 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
