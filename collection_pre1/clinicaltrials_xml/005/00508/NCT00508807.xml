	<detailed_description>RTA 402 new man-made drug design inhibit ( turn ) gene may activate cancer cell cause grow . This drug test human . If find eligible take part study , take RTA 402 mouth ( several capsule day ) morning glass water ( eat ) dose level assign . The dose level receive depend begin study . You receive study drug 21 day row . You take study drug next 7 day . This consider rest period . These 28 day equal 1 cycle . You take study drug instruct . If dose miss vomited , replace either day end 21-day treatment period . At begin study , one three patient may enrol dose level , dose double group first occurrence intolerable side effect Cycle 1 . At first occurrence less severe side effect , group expand 3-4 patient . Dose escalation ( increase ) continue way researcher learn high dose best tolerate . You remain dose level start least 2 cycle . After least 2 cycle , dose may increase another dose determine safe . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study . On Cycle 1 Days 1 21 , ask go Clinical Translational Research Center dose study drug . You ask feel , medication may take include counter medication , herb , alcohol . You ask report bad side effect may experience study drug . You blood draw ( 1 1/2 teaspoon time ) PK study . You PK blood draw take RTA 402 15 minute , 30 minute , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 24 hour take study drug . You vital sign measure 2 , 4 , 8 hour take RTA 402 . You urine collect 24-hour period . The study staff provide urine sample container explain collect urine . During Cycle 1 , return clinic every week routine blood drawn ( 2 teaspoon ) check status disease . You ask feel medication may take include counter medication , herb , alcohol . Each week Cycle 1 Day 28 additional cycle , complete 2 questionnaire take 15 minute complete . You also body weight measure ask normal food intake . Your body composition measure use measurement include body weight height , skin fold thickness , bioelectrical impedance use Tanita body composition monitor scale . This non-invasive method measure total body water , total body fat , total body lean mass . Researchers measure much energy body use rest . You also time test involve participation fast speed ask walk 25 foot walk back . After Cycle 1 , return clinic every week 18 cycle ( 18 month ) long health get bad experience intolerable side effect . During every cycle start Cycle 2 , evaluate check status cancer . You routine image study , x-ray , CT scan , MRIs measure tumor . You bone marrow biopsy ( lymphoid disease ) measure disease . On Day 1 next cycle , return doctor 's office next physical exam begin next cycle study drug . While study , allow take investigational agent , chemotherapy , biologic therapy , immunotherapy , anti-cancer treatment . You allow take medicine help increase white blood cell count . Once complete cycle study drug , end-of-study visit . During visit , physical exam , include measurement vital sign . You blood draw ( 1 1/2 teaspoon ) routine test , urine sample collect . You bone marrow biopsy ( lymphoid disease ) measure disease . You image study , x-ray , CT scan , MRIs measure tumor . You ask report side effect new medication may take include counter medication , herb , alcohol . You follow ( 30 day study ) ask report side effect may experience , new medication may take . You also physical exam , include measurement vital sign . If doctor think continue take RTA 402 ( 18 cycle 18 month ) , ask participate extend study . This investigational study . RTA 402 authorize FDA use research . Up 45 patient take part multicenter study . Up 42 enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
