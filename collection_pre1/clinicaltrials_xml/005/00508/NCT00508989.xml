	<brief_summary>This study determine whether niacin improve blood flow people sickle cell disease , abnormal red blood cell interfere blood flow cause disease symptom . Niacin , drug use increase HDL ( good cholesterol ) level , improve blood flow people without sickle cell disease . This study see people disease . Patients sickle cell disease 18 65 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood test , echocardiogram 6-minute walk test exercise capacity . Participants follow baseline blood flow study : - Flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) : An ultrasound picture artery forearm obtain . A blood pressure cuff place upper arm inflate 5 minute . After pressure cuff release , ultrasound repeat . - Peripheral artery tonometry ( PAT ) : A sensor place subject finger . The sensor put pressure finger measure blood flow . - Standard forearm blood flow test : Small tube place artery forearm inside elbow . Saline infuse one tube . Pressure cuff apply wrist upper arm . A strain gauge ( rubber band device ) place around forearm . When cuff inflate , blood flow arm , stretch strain gauge , flow measurement record . Blood sample collect tube artery measure blood count , protein chemical . At various time , small dos follow drug administer tube vein : - Sodium nitroprusside cause blood vessel dilate increase blood flow heart . - Acetylcholine cause blood vessel dilate slows heart rate . - LNMMA decrease blood flow block production nitric oxide . Blood flow measure dose different drug . There rest period injection different drug . Pictures forearm take study use infrared camera computer . -Drug Treatment . Participants assign take three 4-week course niacin placebo . They return Clinical Center follow interval time start test drug followup : - Weeks 2 , 6 10 : Brief medical history , review medication side effect blood test . - Weeks 4 8 : Physical examination , brief medical history , review medication side effect blood test , repeat FMD PAT blood flow study 6-minute walk test . - Week 12 : Same week 4 8 plus standard blood flow study echocardiogram ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease autosomal recessive disorder common genetic disease affect African-Americans . Approximately 0.15 percent African-Americans homozygous sickle cell disease , 8 percent sickle cell trait . Hemoglobin S polymerization lead red cell rigidity , microvascular obstruction , inflammation , end-organ ischemic injury . Our publish data indicate 50 percent sickle cell patient vascular dysfunction due impaired bioavailability endogenous nitric oxide , due large part scavenge nitric oxide cell-free hemoglobin . We recently complete study directly demonstrate endothelial dysfunction patient sickle cell disease , characterize decrease ACh dependent vasorelaxation forearm blood flow study , distinct nitric oxide resistance . Further , find sickle cell patient new association low level apoA-I , pulmonary hypertension endothelial dysfunction . Raising level HDL , therefore apoA-1 , could effect ameliorate endothelial dysfunction characteristic sickle cell disease affect endothelium dependent vasorelaxation . Therapies direct restore HDL patient may beneficial . HDL think promote vascular health variety way , unrelated lipid transport . One best-known mechanism relate efflux cholesterol atherosclerotic plaque , yet HDL think several antithrombotic anti-inflammatory effect . In vitro HDL attenuate formation oxidize LDL inhibits endothelial cell expression inflammatory cell adhesion molecule . It also think mediate NO production via stimulation eNOS , thereby modulate endothelial function . In study subject atherosclerosis , low HDL level correlate impaired vasomotor relaxation via brachial artery FMD . Another study utilize recombinant HDL cholesterol infuse brachial artery hypercholesterolemic men result increased acetylcholine mediate blood flow inhibit infusion L-NAME , eNOS inhibitor , suggest HDL increase blood flow via eNOS dependent mechanism . This may implications subject atherosclerosis , also sickle cell disease endothelial dysfunction . We propose niacin therapy could improve vascular reactivity response acetylcholine . Several option increase HDL level previously utilize forearm flow study use venous occlusion plethysmography flow-mediated dilation . Reconstituted HDL ( rHDL ) , apoA-1 mimetics niacin therapy show improve endothelial dysfunction , prove safe effective . This trial aim 1 ) establish effect niacin treatment raise HDL level subject sickle cell disease , 2 ) investigate whether niacin treatment would result improvement endothelial-dependent relaxation via venous occlusion plethysmography , 3 ) compare efficacy peripheral arterial tonometry measurement venous occlusion plethysmography flow-mediated dilation indicator vascular dysfunction .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Males females 18 65 year age . Diagnosis sickle cell disease ( electrophoretic HPLC documentation hemoglobin S phenotype require ) . Hemoglobin great 5.5 gram per deciliter Absolute reticulocyte count great 95,000 microliters hemoglobin less 9.0 gram per deciliter . An apoA1 level lower 99 milligram per deciliter ( median value among sickle cell subject ) , HDLC level 39 milligram per deciliter ( median value amongst sickle cell cohort ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Acute pain crisis require intravenous analgesic within last week . Current pregnancy lactation . Hemoglobin SC disease , hemoglobin A great 20 % Conditions may independently affect endothelial function : 1 . Diabetes mellitus 2 . Cigarette smoke within one month 3 .

No aspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) 1 week prior forearm blood flow assessment caffeine day forearm blood flow study . Subjects opiates acetaminophen exclude . Subjects take sildenafil , vardenafil , tadalafil , Larginine , fibrates ( e.g. , clofibrate , gemfibrozil , fenofribrate ) inhale nitric oxide within last week exclude study . Subjects take statin drug ( e.g. , fluvastatin , lovastatin , pravastatin , simvastatin , rosuvastatin ) within last four week exclude study . Subjects take prostaglandin epoprostenol treprostinil exclude study . Subjects significant cardiac disease and/or know peripheral Arterial disease . Subjects significant hypotension .
