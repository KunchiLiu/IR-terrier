	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess pharmacokinetics two oral dose regimens SCIO-469 , without methotrexate , patient active rheumatoid arthritis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Oral SCIO-469 Pharmacokinetics ( Study Drug Body Watch How Drug Absorbed , Distributed , Metabolized Eliminated Over Period Time ) Body Female Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCIO-469 develop treatment active rheumatoid arthritis , disease occur mostly woman ; therefore , female patient active rheumatoid arthritis select study population . This study first detail pharmacokinetic evaluation ( study drug body watch drug absorb , distribute , metabolize eliminated period time ) SCIO-469 new capsule formulation . Methotrexate frequently prescribe treatment patient rheumatoid arthritis ; thus , SCIO-469 could potentially use along methotrexate . It known methotrexate affect pharmacokinetics SCIO-469 ; therefore , study design include patient take stable dos methotrexate patient take methotrexate . This Phase II , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither patient physician know study treatment patient receive ) , parallel-group study design ass pharmacokinetics , safety , tolerability SCIO-469 female patient active rheumatoid arthritis . Sixteen patient enrol study , eight receive stable dos methotrexate eight receive methotrexate . No disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) allow . Pharmacokinetics evaluate SCIO-469 metabolite , test significant difference occasion ( Day 1 Day 12 ) , treatment ( 30 mg three time day 90 mg day ) , stratum ( methotrexate non methotrexate ) . Safety assessment study include clinical adverse event , concomitant medication , clinical assessment ( medical history , physical examination , vital orthostatic vital sign , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , clinical laboratory evaluation [ serum chemistry , urinalysis , hematology , liver function test , pregnancy test ] ) . Patients receive stable dos methotrexate ( take week , either orally injection ) receive methotrexate randomize one two oral capsule SCIO-469 dosing regimen : 30 mg three time day 90 mg day . Patients take study drug 11 12 day , study drug take Day 2 . On Day 19 , seven day end treatment , patient undergo follow-up assessment safety variable .</detailed_description>
