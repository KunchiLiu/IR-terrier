	<brief_summary>This multi-centre , phase II study ass efficacy safety ZD6474 patient Child-Pugh class A , inoperable HCC . This study comprise 2 phase , primary treatment phase secondary treatment phase . The primary treatment phase randomise , double-blind , parallel-group phase II study ass efficacy safety ZD6474 300 mg plus best support care ( BSC ) , ZD6474 100 mg plus BSC , placebo plus BSC . The secondary treatment phase open-label expanded access program ZD6474 . In primary treatment phase , patient randomise 1:1:1 ratio receive ZD6474 300 mg plus BSC , ZD6474 100 mg plus BSC , placebo plus BSC , respectively . Randomisation stratify basis Cancer Liver Italian Programme ( CLIP ) tumour stag ( CLIP score 0-2 versus 3-4 ) . The primary treatment continue objective disease progression , accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumours ( RECIST ) criterion , patient meet withdrawal discontinuation criteria.The primary endpoint tumour stabilisation rate , secondary endpoint objective response rate , progression-free survival , overall survival . The purpose secondary treatment phase expand access ZD6474 every patient enrol study chance receive active medicine.Once individual patient progressive disease primary treatment phase , blind broken patient . If patient ZD6474 100 mg arm placebo arm , patient offer secondary treatment ZD6474 300 mg per day . If patient randomise ZD6474 300 mg arm , study medication discontinue unless patient wish remain treatment , patient follow survival .</brief_summary>
