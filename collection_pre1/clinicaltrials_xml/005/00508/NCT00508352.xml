	<brief_summary>Research show treatment conventional radiation technique chemotherapy follow mastectomy breast conserve surgery result good rate locoregional control overall survival stage IIB-III breast cancer . The current feasibility trial use recent advance radiation therapy , namely helical tomotherapy intensity modulate radiation therapy ( HT-IMRT ) , hop improve result conventional radiation decrease amount radiation-induced toxicity patient stage IIb-III breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-operative Radiation With IMRT Management Stage IIB-III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The role locoregional radiation therapy management stage IIB III breast cancer evolve continue evolve . The exact role locoregional radiation , include axillary , supraclavicular internal mammary node , however , clear . Radiation-induced toxicity remain limit factor expand indication radiation therapy axillary internal mammary node treatment stage IIB III breast cancer . Excellent target coverage normal tissue spar IMRT previously demonstrate dosimetrically clinically . In feasibility study , patient receive 50 Gy radiation therapy 25 fraction chest wall supraclavicular , axillary IM nodal area use HT-IMRT follow breast conserve surgery mastectomy chemotherapy . Patients also eligible radiation boost 12 Gy HT-IMRT HDR brachytherapy . It expect treatment HT-IMRT result appreciably few side-effects follow locoregional irradiation due reduction normal tissue irradiation , compare conventional radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
