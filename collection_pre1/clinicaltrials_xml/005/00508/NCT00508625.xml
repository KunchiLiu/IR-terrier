	<brief_summary>This phase 2 multicenter , open label , randomize study AMG 951 ( rhApo2L/TRAIL ) subject previously untreated stage IIIb/IV NSCLC treat chemotherapy without bevacizumab . Subjects assign set treatment group depend eligibility receive bevacizumab . Subjects squamous NSCLC and/or CNS metastases eligible receive bevacizumab assign either cohort A B ( provide eligibility criterion meet ) . Subjects eligible receive bevacizumab assign cohort C , D E. Cohorts define follow : Subjects squamous NSCLC CNS mets : Cohort A : Chemotherapy alone Cohort B : Chemotherapy plus 8 mg/kg AMG 951 5 day Subjects without squamous NSCLC without CNS mets : Cohort C : Chemotherapy bevacizumab Cohort D : Chemotherapy , bevacizumab plus 8 mg/kg AMG 951 5 day Cohort E : Chemotherapy , bevacizumab plus 20 mg/kg AMG 951 2 day Approximately forty subject recruit cohort .</brief_summary>
