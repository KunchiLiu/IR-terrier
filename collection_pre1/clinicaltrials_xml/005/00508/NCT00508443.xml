	<brief_title>Evaluation Novel CT-On-Rails Trilogy Stereotactic Spine Radiotherapy System ( SSRS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CT-On-Rails Trilogy system place radiation treatment machine room CT scanner CT scanner help deliver radiation precisely . You MRI spine within 1 month registration study . You also fill health survey ( 5 minute ) , symptom inventory ( 5 minute ) , Brief Pain Inventory ( 5 minute ) within 1 week registration . A pretreatment feasibility study first perform determine precision , accuracy , reproducibility target volume critical normal structure ( e.g . spinal cord ) position relative radiation beam spine tumor ; consist CT scan . Patients CT-simulation . The simulation like CT scan special body frame use keep patient move scan later treatment . You ask question medical history complete neurological exam first consultation . The neurological exam involve test upper low motor strength , sensation light touch , reflex , mental exam , way walk . MRI spine must perform within 1 month registration . You ask complete 3 questionnaire evaluate symptom pain . Each questionnaire take around 5 minute complete , complete within 1 month enrol study . All patient treat radiation therapy guide CT-on-Rails Trilogy procedure . Patients receive CT scan immediately treatment room treatment use CT-On-Rails Trilogy . There total 3 treatment period 2 week . Monitoring side effect focus neurological , gastrointestinal , musculoskeletal , hematological system . Every attempt make patient complete prescribe course radiation maximize beneficial effect treatment . However , severe side effect , radiation treatment stop patient take study . You follow visit week radiation treatment , schedule day radiation . After treatment , telephone , mail , follow-ups per fax schedule 2 4 week , 2 month post radiation . You follow visit schedule 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 month , every six month rest life . At follow-up visit , ask question medical history , neurological exam , neurologic function evaluate . Any pain medication taking note . You MRI spine 3 , 6 , 9 , 12,18 , 24 month , year rest life . You also ask complete 3 questionnaire evaluate symptom pain . Each questionnaire take around 5 minute complete . This investigational study . The CT-on-rails Trilogy linear accelerator FDA-approved medical device commercially available , however , way two device use investigational . Up 150 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Radiographically documented spine paraspinal metastasis demonstrate spine MRI within 4 wks registration 2 . Maximum 2 metastatic site spine irradiate single course treatment . 3 . Informed consent irradiation reirradiation spinal paraspinal tumor ( ) 4 . Diagnosis cancer include limited lung ( nonsmall cell small cell ) , breast , prostate , renal cell , melanoma , gastrointestinal , germ cell tumor , unknown primary tumor 5 . Karnofsky performance status least 40 ( i.e . require active hospitalization ) 6 . Maximum 1 prior course spine radiotherapy current region interest allow . 1 . Worsening neurological status due radiographic evidence spinal cord compression require immediate surgical decompression emergent conventional external radiation therapy 2 . Delay initiation radiation treatment would potentially detrimental neurological outcome 3 . Patients already retreat radiation part protocol eligible additional retreatment 4 . Unstable spine require surgical stabilization . 5 . Sites outside spine ( eg . lung , liver ) eligible treatment 6 . Systemic radiotherapy ( Sr89 ) within 30 day 7 . Prior irradiation area treat within 3 month registration 8 . Patients currently receive , receive chemotherapy within 30 day eligible 9 . Inability tolerate lie flat treatment couch great 30 minute . 10 . Patient multiple myeloma 11 . Patients unable undergo MRI spine 12 . Patients pacemaker 13 . Patients previously receive maximum cord tolerance 45 Gy 5 week conventional fractionation equivalent dose current area treat .</criteria>
