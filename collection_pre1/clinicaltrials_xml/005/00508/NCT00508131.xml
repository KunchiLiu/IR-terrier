	<detailed_description>Introduction . Iron deficiency anemia common nutritional deficiency worldwide ( 1-3 ) .Children less 5 year affect ( 4 ) . Almost 24 % Mexican child 1-4 year age anemic 52 % iron deficient ( 5 ) . The peak prevalence anemia ( 38 % ) occur child 12-23 month age ( 6 ) . The prevalence high low socioeconomic household ( 29 % ) remain high even high quintile ( 17 % ) . Anemia iron deficiency infant young child associate adverse effect neurodevelopment ( 7-12 ) . During several decade , Mexican government sell whole milk subsidize price low income household child 1-11 age federal program ( Liconsa ) . In 2000 decision make fortify subsidized milk iron , vitamin C micronutrient contribute reduction IDA micronutrient deficiency . At time , 4.2 million child 1-11 old low income family beneficiaries program . There examples large scale public health intervention use iron fortify whole milk . The effectiveness intervention food fortification reduce anemia iron deficiency often question ( 14 ) little information available effectiveness strategy implement large scale program . Reliable evidence effectiveness strategy apply large-scale program need plan intervention aim reduce prevalence iron zinc deficiency anemia children.This study aim document effectiveness iron zinc deficiency , anemia stunting , young child large-scale program distribute iron zinc fortify milk low income household subsidize price . Methods The subsidized milk distribution program . The program create 1944 operated public organization ( Liconsa ) ( 15 ) . It distribute whole milk subsidize price family live poverty . The milk distribute intend mostly child 1-11 . It distribute milk distribution center throughout Country dry powder 240 g sachet yield two liter fluid milk hydration 1 L container fluid milk . Children receive equivalent 400 mL fluid milk per day either dry fluid form reduce prevalence iron deficiency anemia micronutrient deficiency , fortification product iron , zinc , vitamin C micronutrient deficient diet low income child Mexico ( 5 , 16 ) . The program serve approximately 5 million individual 4.2 million child &lt; 11 year 650,000 child 12-30 month age . Design sample . This randomized effectiveness trial child 12-30 mo age conduct 4 States Central Eastern Mexico . The randomized effectiveness trial conduct 12 milk distribution cluster ( MDC ) comprise periurban area serve around 5000 beneficiary one milk distribution center . These cluster randomly select universe MDC ( n=542 ) 4 States central eastern Mexico . The twelve cluster randomly assign receive either fortified ( n=7 ) non-fortified ( n=5 ) milk use random number list . The cluster assign non-fortified milk start receive fortify milk end trial . The milk distribute participant trial dry form . The duration trial 12 month baseline survey 2 follow-up survey approximately 6 12 month . The baseline study conduct May 28 July 30 , 2003 . The 6 mo 12 mo follow-up survey conduct December 2003 February 2004 June July 2004 , respectively . The mean time baseline 6 mo follow 5.4 mo 6 12 mo follow 6.8 month . The package fortify non-fortified milk undistinguishable , except color-coded band upper corner sachet . The color code unknown researcher , field worker , program beneficiary , disclose data analysis . The iron zinc content fortify milk analyze laboratory sample milk powder obtain LICONSA begin intervention . Mothers caretaker child participate study receive information instruction provide regularly beneficiary milk distribution program MDC . They instruct reconstitute milk powder encourage feed select child 400 mL , preferably two separate time day ( 200 mL morning 200 mL afternoon ) . Milk buy collect family weekly bimonthly basis MDC . The portion 400 mL rehydrated fortified milk ( FM ) contain 5.28 mg iron ferrous gluconate , 48 mg sodium ascorbate , 5.28 mg zinc zinc oxide 36.2 mg folic acid . The non-fortified milk ( NFM ) contain per 400 mL : 0.16 mg iron , 1.6 mg zinc 6.8 mg vitamin C. The micronutrient premix , purchase DSM Nutritional Products ( Herleen , The Nederland ) add powder milk plant manufacturer ( LICONSA , SA , Queretaro , Mexico ) 220 g unit product pack metallic foil sachet . A list households child 12-30 month age ( n=798 ) beneficiaries program 12 distribution cluster provide program officer begin study . 510 child correspond distribution cluster assign FM 288 cluster assign NFM . The number child FM cluster large two reason : cluster assign receive FM request program official wish minimize number child would receive fortified milk immediately . In addition , cluster randomly assign fortified milk intervention serve large population beneficiary . The parent legal guardian 12-30 month old child invite participate accept sign informed consent letter detail explanation objective , nature , risk pose study . Prior baseline measurement 33 child exclude study ( 20 FM 13 NFM group ) either severely anemic ( Hb concentration &lt; 90 g/L , n= 26 ) refuse participate ( n=7 . Therefore , 765 child participate baseline measurement ( 490 FM 275 NFM cluster ) . Between baseline 6-mo follow-up measurement , 130 child lose follow several reason . Therefore 635 child complete 6 mo follow ( n= 405 FM 230 NFM group ) . Between 6-mo 12-mo follow-up measurement , 51 additional child lose follow . Therefore 584 child complete 12 mo follow ( n= 371 FM 213 NFM group ) . For 635 child complete 6 mo follow-up 584 complete 12 mo follow-up , hemoglobin concentration ( main outcome study ) well basic socio-demographic variable available . iron status . The protocol review approved Human Subjects Ethics Committee National Public Health Institute , Mexico . Data collection processing . At begin study questionnaire housing characteristic possession household good apply mother child caretaker household . Hemoglobin concentration determine baseline 6 12 month capillary blood sample obtain finger prick use Portable Photometer Hemocue ( HemoCue , Angelholm , Sweden ) 17 , 18 . Reliability photometer assess fieldwork begin end working day . A three-level liquid quality control check ( 4C-ESControl , Beckman-Coulter , Miami Fla , USA ) , reading precalibrated reference cuvette include equipment use purpose . The mean difference duplicate 0.3 ± 9.9 g/L , ( P=0.36 liquid quality control material -0.24 ± 3.6 g/L , P= 0.27 reference cuvette ) . Venous blood sample draw child baseline 6 12 mo . Samples centrifuge serum store color cod cryovials keep liquid nitrogen delivery central laboratory . Commercial kit use measure SF concentration , ( Dade Behring Inc , Newark , DE 19714 , U.S.A. ) sTfR ( Dade Behring , Maburg , Germany ) ELISA . C reactive protein ( CPR ) determine nephelometry , use monoclonal antibody ( Behring Nephelometer 100 Analyzer , Behring Laboratories , Messer Grisheim Gmbh , Frankfurt , Germany . Serun zinc concentration mesured Atomic Absorption spectrometry Analyst 300 model graphite furnace ( Perkin Elmer ) . Length weight measure baseline 6 12 mo enrollment . Weight measure near 10 g use electronic scale ( Tanita , Model 1583 , Tokyo , Japan ) . Length measure near millimeter use locally make measure board child &lt; 24 month age stand height , use stadimeter precision 1 mm ( Dyna-Top , model E-1 , Mexico City , Mexico ) child 24 month old . The measurement obtain use standard technique ( 19 , 20 ) . The birth date report mother corroborate large proportion child use birth certificate . Length weight data transform z-scores use WHO/NCHS/CDC reference data ( 21 ) . To verify compliance field worker visit household every month , usual time milk intake child , verify correct reconstitution milk register amount milk consume . During visit questionnaire apply regard intake milk previous week . A morbidity questionnaire apply visit . Feeding practice assess every 2 month food frequency questionnaire apply mother caretaker . Anemia define accord CDC recommendation hemoglobin concentration &lt; 110 g/L sea level ( 18 ) . Hemoglobin concentration adjust altitude follow equation propose Cohen Haas ( 22 ) . Iron deficiency define SF &lt; 12 ug/L sTfR &gt; 6 mg/L . SF indicate level storage iron sTfR reflect tissue iron deficiency . Zinc deficiency define IZnCG ( &lt; 65ug/dL ) . Using information housing characteristic possession household good , indicator socioeconomic status ( SES ) derive first component obtain Principal Components Analysis ( 23 ) Only variables factor loading &gt; 0.5 maintain model . The variable include factor : flooring material , ceiling material , availability pip water , sanitary service , possession refrigerator wash machine well number electric appliance household : radio , TV , video player , telephone , computer . The result standardized factor score divide tertiles use construct SES status category . Statistical method . Characteristics study child baseline 5 12 month socioeconomic status family compare intervention group use t-test continuous variable Ji2 categorical variable ( 24 ) . Distributions normal transform compare use t-test . When adequate transformation achieve , Wilcoxon Rank-sum test employed ( 24 . Intervention effect 6 12 moth assess use General Linear Mixed Models three repeat measure ( 25 ) . Dependent variable prevalence anemia iron deficiency either SF sTfR . The interaction term intervention indicator variables 6 12 month use measure effect 6 12 month adjust baseline measurement . All model adjust cluster effect ( Milk Distribution Centers ) covariates .
