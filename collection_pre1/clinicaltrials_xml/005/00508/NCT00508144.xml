	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn effective drug pemetrexed ( ALIMTA® ) treat advanced NSCLC patient poor performance status ( PS ) ( inability perform every day activity without difficulty ) . Objectives : Primary Objectives : - PS = 2 cohort : Response - PS = 3 cohort : Descriptive Secondary Objectives : - Tolerability single agent pemetrexed ( Alimta® ) PS = 3 NSCLC patient - Improved symptom ( cohort ) - Molecular Correlative study ( cohort ) - Overall survival - Time progression</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Agent Alimta Poor Performance Status Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pemetrexed design block enzyme body important tumor growth . Pemetrexed commercially approve treatment NSCLC poor performance status patient . If participant find eligible take part study , receive pemetrexed every 3 week needle vein 10 minute . Every 3 week consider 1 treatment cycle . Once treatment start , return clinic every treatment cycle . At visit , physical exam , performance status evaluation , routine blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine test . They chest x-ray ask complete questionnaire feeling . also CT MRI scan Cycle 1 every odd cycle . They require take folic acid mouth every day 5 day first dose pemetrexed continue 3 week last dose pemetrexed . They also receive injection vitamin B12 muscle first dose pemetrexed . The vitamin B12 injection repeat every 9 week 3 week last dose pemetrexed . They also take low-dose steroid ( dexamethasone ) tablet twice day treatment , day treatment , day treatment . These take decrease risk rash nausea cause pemetrexed . They may continue treatment pemetrexed tumor grows unacceptable side effect occur . They evaluate symptom 1-2 time per week receive treatment 2 week stop study treatment 6 month stop treatment . When stop treatment study , physical exam , routine blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) urine test , chest x-ray . The study doctor may ask visit University Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center contact phone follow-up . This investigational study . The FDA approve pemetrexed treatment advance NSCLC earlier treatment chemotherapy , treatment malignant mesothelioma combination cisplatin . About 70 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
