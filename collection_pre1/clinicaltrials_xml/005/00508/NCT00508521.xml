	<brief_summary>Many stroke survivor exhibit persistent upper limb motor deficit non-functional upper limb . There promise information suggest motor learning ( ML ) conjunction functional electrical stimulation ( FES ; surface FES ; nothing implant ; use commercially available system ) wrist/finger muscle significantly enhance functional level upper limb . There promise study show subject chronic phase ( great 6 month stroke ) respond favorably combination FES ML ( FES ML ) . In pilot study , FES ML chronic phase ( &gt; 12 month ) produce statistically significant functional recovery . FES apply use commercially available , two-channel FES system , electrodes applied surface skin ( non-invasive ) . But upper limb dysfunction immediately treat , within sub-acute phase ( le 6 month ) follow stroke , follow problem develop : contracture soft tissue change ; chronic pain ; ingrain , abnormal , non-functional movement pattern . The long-standing symptom , resistant treatment become . Therefore , important provide promising intervention prior onset chronic symptom dysfunction . Those sub-acute phase stroke provide FES ML , order completely restore function great number stroke survivor . Specific Aims Hypotheses The goal pilot study test feasibility propose treatment sub acute phase follow stroke . HYPOTHESIS . FES ML 3hrs/day , five days/week , 12 week feasible implement sub-acute phase follow stroke ( 2 -24 week ) . Study Design . Specific Procedures This pilot study test feasibility use FES ML upper extremity rehabilitation sub-acute stroke population . It randomize , control , single-blind design . Subjects 2 - 24 week single stroke . The control group receive standard care upper limb rehabilitation consist passive active exercise , stretch , bracing , use adaptive device . The experimental group receive experimental intervention addition standard care . CONTROL GROUP INTERVENTION . The control group receive standard medical care prescribe primary physician cover subject 's health care policy . Standard care include : soft tissue mobilization ; assist motion exercise ; active motion exercise ; resistive exercise ; task practice ; use assistive device ; modality application conventionally prescribe . FES ML INTERVENTION . The research treatment duration 3hrs/day , five day per week . The subject present fourth hour day , use break rest period intersperse throughout intervention time . The treatment duration derive prior work . We stimulate muscle number configuration include : wrist extension finger extension ; wrist extension finger flexion ; wrist extension , finger flexion , thumb abduction opposition . Motor learn include performance functional task component full task practice use FES . FES trigger patient , treat therapist , automatically sequence device accord alternate channel activation , timing pre-set treat therapist . MEASURES . Data collect week 1 , 6 , 12 ( end treatment ) , 6 month end treatment . Population The subject sub-acute stroke survivor ( 2-24 week stroke ) .</brief_summary>
