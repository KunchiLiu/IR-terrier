	<brief_summary>Unlike ventricular arrhythmia , role n-3 PUFAs atrial arrhythmia fully investigate . A recently publish epidemiological study report elderly patient , consumption fish associate low incidence atrial fibrillation 12 year follow-up . This observation may indirect effect due overall beneficial effort fish consumption reduce ischaemic heart disease , however association persist adjustment confound characteristic . Clinical data regard direct impact n-3 PUFAs atrial arrhythmia atrial fibrillation/flutter ( AF ) lacking . However , INa ICa-L also atrial myocytes , similar anti-fibrillatory action n-3PUFAs would expect atrial fibrillation would like investigate . The primary aim study investigate whether dietary supplement n-3 PUFA concentrate ( 1g fish oil/day comprise eicosapentaenoic acid , EPA 46 % docosahexaenoic , DHA 38 % ) ) help maintain sinus rhythm cardioversion normal sinus rhythm patient persistent atrial fibrillation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient . Randomisation . Patients persistent AF recruit clinic attendee in-patient hospital patient Ninewells Hospital Medical School . A total 150 patient AF 7 day duration schedule elective direct current cardioversion recruit . The patient randomise receive fish oil supplement ( 3g/day ) placebo recruitment period 4 week prior cardioversion continue cardioversion recurrence AF end 6 month . All patient anticoagulated routinely . Patients anti-arrhythmic drug , leave atrial size &gt; 6 cm , significant mitral valve disease , myocardial infarction last 3 month , unstable angina , NYHA IV heart failure , cardiac surgery previous 3 month , acute reversible condition , significant thyroid , hepatic , pulmonary disease , pregnancy child bear potential exclude study . 3.2 . End Points Study . The primary endpoint time first electrocardiographically confirm recurrence atrial fibrillation/flutter last 10 minute . Secondary endpoint shock number energy requirement achieve electrical cardioversion . All patient give informed consent approval obtain Ethics Committee Ninewells Hospital Medical School . 3.3 . Free n-3 PUFA plasma concentration On day cardioversion , 3mls venous blood obtain measurement free n-3 PUFA plasma concentration . 3.4 . Elective Direct current cardioversion Follow-up Patients routinely schedule cardioversion ( 2 per week ) outpatient . Cardioversion conscious sedation ( titrated dos intravenous midazolam ) current routine practice Department Cardiology , Ninewells Hospital . Follow-up ( ECG ) cardioverted patient weekly first month ; 2,3,4,5 6 month ; time patient complains palpitation symptom .</detailed_description>
