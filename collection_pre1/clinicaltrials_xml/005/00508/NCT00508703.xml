	<brief_title>Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy ( IMRT ) Pelvis Post-Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard radiotherapy technique deliver radiation therapy pelvis follow hysterectomy involves technique also cause large amount normal tissue receive radiation . This cause early late side effect , may severe . The new technique intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) use help spare normal tissue , especially tissue small bowel . This advanced new technology delivers high-dose radiation target area avoids normal tissue . Using CT scan , target outline doctor treatment . However , sometimes organs pelvis move throughout course treatment . Using CT scan treatment re-outlining target may help deliver radiation cancer tissue less surround normal area . During study , additional CT scan perform special scanner radiation treatment room . You also additional CT scan twice week 5 week radiation treatment . The first 12 participant enrol receive standard radiation therapy take account maximum possible movement bladder . No adjustment make accord result additional CT scan . The next 12 participant may radiation therapy adjust accord CT scan effort target less normal tissue without miss cancer tissue . To reduce movement bladder due different amount fluid bladder , ask drink 3 glass water treatment come treatment full bladder . The volume bladder rectum also study , side effect treatment record . You ask fill short questionnaire side effect treatment 3 time per week treatment . It take around 5 minute complete questionnaire . Patients follow least 2 year . ( Every 3 month 1 year 4 month second year accord usual clinic practice . ) This investigational study . IMRT radiation therapy approve method treat type cancer . However , adjust radiation treatment accord movement internal organ investigational . Initial CT scan treatment plan part standard treatment . Up 24 participant take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
