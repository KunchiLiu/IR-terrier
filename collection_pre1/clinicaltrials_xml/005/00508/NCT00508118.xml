	<brief_summary>Objective The objective study discover whether infusion nicardipine able reduce time take achieve electrocerebral silence ( ECS ) cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) aortic surgery . Hypothesis By inhibit cold-induced cerebral vasoconstriction , nicardipine maintain cerebral blood flow allow rapid cool brain CPB . This manifest reduction time take achieve ECS also reduction overall CPB time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients undergo thoracic aortic surgery Duke University Medical Center ( DUMC ) require hypothermic circulatory arrest ( HCA ) neurophysiologic monitoring ( NIOM ) give write informed consent enrol study . Exclusion criterion include previously document allergy nicardipine age le 18 year . Patients randomize one two study group : general anesthesia without nicardipine . Pre-operatively undergo clinical evaluation determine attend surgeon anesthesiologist . During pre-induction time period , usual monitor intravenous device place discretion attend anesthesiologist . In addition standard anesthetic monitor ( Bispectral Index [ BIS ] cerebral oximetry ) , transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) place . Furthermore , neurophysiology technician place standard EEG somatosensory evoke potential ( SSEP ) electrode configuration . During pre-induction time period , midazolam use discretion anesthesiologist limit maximum dose 0.1 mg/kg ; benzodiazepine allow . Opioid ( fentanyl ) administration discretion anesthesiologist . Total benzodiazepine opioid dose record converted midazolam fentanyl equivalent subsequent analysis . When ready , patient transport operating room anesthesia induce . Induction consist propofol ( 1 - 5 mg/kg single intravenous bolus ) , fentanyl vecuronium neuromuscular blockade . Other drug dosage opioids neuromuscular blocker discretion anesthesiologist . After induction tracheal intubation , patient receive maintenance anesthesia 0.5 minimal alveolar concentration ( MAC ) isoflurane 50 % air/oxygen balance mixture supplement fentanyl discretion anesthesiologist . At onset cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) , study drug ( nicardipine equivalent volume placebo - 0.9 % saline ) infusion 5 mg/hr initiate , patient receive 0.5 MAC isoflurane CPB circuit sweep gas . Bolus dose 100mcg phenylephrine administer group order maintain constant mean arterial pressure least 50 mmHg . Cooling occur primarily CPB machine . When patient 's brain temperature reach 28o C , isoflurane ( via pump ) reduce 0.25 MAC . When ECS EEG ablation cortical response SSEP occur , CPB study drug infusion halt , thoracic aortic surgery commence . After aortic repair occur , CPB study drug infusion 5 mg/hr reinstate , anesthesia administration resume , patient actively rewarmed . When patient 's brain temperature reach 28o C ( record nasopharyngeal temperature ) , patient receive 0.5 MAC isoflurane . After patient fully re-warmed ready separation CPB , study drug infusion halt . At point , , commercially available nicardipine may infuse desire . 10 ml blood sample draw pump baseline 15 minute interval thereafter HCA achieve . When pump restart , sample draw 15 minute interval patient separate CPB sample take . One sample 10 ml drawn retrograde cardioplegia line immediately placement ( baseline ) one sample drawn immediately prior separation CPB . In total , approximately 100 ml blood drawn patient research purpose . This volume represent tiny percentage excess volume associate pump prime , insignificant term effect hemodynamics . Baseline patient characteristic collect pre-operative period include age , sex , weight , height , blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , comorbidities , type aortic disease , American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) grade . Prior initiation CPB , several factor record include arterial blood pressure , heart rate , cerebral oximetry , bispectral index score ( BIS ) , latency &amp; amplitude SSEP , frequency EEG background , cerebral blood flow assess middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) velocity TCD , nasopharyngeal temperature . During cooling , BIS score , cerebral oximetry , MCA velocity TCD note 0.5o C decrement nasopharyngeal temperature ; duration CPB initiation 3 characteristic EEG change ( 1. rhythmic delta , 2 . Generalized periodic epileptiform discharge ( GPED ) , 3. burst suppression ) define neurophysiologist , duration CPB initiation 2 characteristic SSEP change ( 1. latency increase &gt; 10 % , 2. amplitude decrease 50 % baseline ) , hemodynamics 1o C nasopharyngeal temperature drop also record . At time HCA , several factor document include nasopharyngeal temperature , duration CPB initiation ( primary endpoint measure ) , total opioid dos , cerebral oximetry , BIS score , MCA velocity TCD , hemodynamics . During rewarming , factor document fashion interval cool . At first attempt separation CPB , document factor include BIS score , cerebral oximetry , MCA velocity TCD , duration CPB reinstitution first attempt separation , total dose study drug , nasopharyngeal temperature , hemodynamics . Finally , addition Adverse Events ( AEs ) may occur , data relate length ICU stay , length hospital stay , in-hospital mortality , in-hospital acute kidney injury ( defined 50 % rise baseline serum creatinine , least 0.3 mg/dl need dialysis ) , in-hospital stroke , in-hospital myocardial infarction , discharge disposition hospital ( home , skilled nursing facility , institution ) record postoperatively . With exception on-pump blood draw , protocol additional procedure safety measure indicate necessary purpose research . All anesthetic regimen monitor technique currently standard care . Nicardipine infusion currently widely use cardiac anesthesia post-operative cardiac recovery .</detailed_description>
