	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study evaluate whether thermal imaging ( record body temperature ) use check body 's response cancer therapy . Primary Objective : - The primary objective study establish technique methodology quantify thermal signature change cancer patient undergo chemoradiation therapy . Secondary Objective : - The secondary objective evaluate correspondence change thermal signature normal organ , e.g . lung esophagus , versus toxicity organ chemoradiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For Patients : THERMAL IMAGER : A thermal imager ( camera similar digital camera ) take picture skin surface . The imager able view temperature distribution skin surface . STUDY PARTICIPATION : If agree take part study , body temperature measure thermal imaging . You thermal image session several time cancer treatment start therapy course . You give detailed instruction prepare image session ahead time well expect image session . Before begin thermal imaging , temperature measure thermometer . To perform thermal imaging , ask take clothes private room stand still front thermal image camera . No one present disrobe . When finish take clothes radiation oncologist medical doctor record several picture computer station outside room . Pictures front , back , side view take . These picture look like silhouette ( body outline ) thermal color . The entire imaging session take 10 minute complete time . LENGTH OF STUDY : Your participation study thermal image record . This investigational study . Thermal image FDA approve commercially available breast cancer screening . Its use study investigational . Up 35 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson . For Volunteers : THERMAL IMAGER : A thermal imager ( camera similar digital camera ) take picture skin surface . The imager able view temperature distribution skin surface . STUDY PARTICIPATION : If agree take part study , body temperature measure thermal imaging . You thermal image session several time course study . You give detailed instruction prepare image session ahead time well expect image session . Before begin thermal imaging , temperature measure thermometer . To perform thermal imaging , ask take clothes private room stand still front thermal image camera . No one present disrobe . When finish take clothes radiation oncologist medical doctor record several picture computer station outside room . Pictures front , back , side view take . These picture look like silhouette ( body outline ) thermal color . The entire imaging session take 10 minute complete time . Volunteers participate part cancer treatment , diagnostic imaging test ( CT , PET , etc ) , clinical procedure MD Anderson . Volunteers need see physician MD Anderson elsewhere . Thermal image take 4 time one day volunteer ( morning , midmorning , early afternoon , late afternoon ) . Volunteers take medication perform medical procedure morning late afternoon thermal imaging complete . LENGTH OF STUDY : Your participation study thermal image record . This investigational study . Thermal image FDA approve commercially available breast cancer screening . Its use study investigational . Up 10 volunteer without cancer ( 5 male 5 non-pregnant female ) take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
