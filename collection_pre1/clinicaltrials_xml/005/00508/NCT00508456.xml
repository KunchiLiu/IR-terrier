	<brief_summary>Objectives : 1 . To determine safety , tolerability efficacy dietary methionine restriction 7 day alternate Temodar® ( Temozolomide ) give day seven day repeat one year treatment patient recurrent and/or progressive glioblastoma . 2 . To determine short- long-term toxicity dietary methionine restriction combine Temodar® glioblastoma patient . 3 . To measure correlate patient ' tumor response progression-free survival : serum methionine peripheral blood lymphocyte methylation level . In patient undergoing surgery , measure tumor alkylguanyl transferase ( AGT ) methionine level compare control specimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dietary Methionine Restriction Plus Temozolomide Recurrent GBM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methionine essential amino acid . Many solid tumor depend methionine take diet . The tumor need methionine grow . A methionine free ( reduce ) diet may help shrink slow growth tumor . Temozolomide drug commonly use treatment glioma . A methionine free ( reduce ) diet may increase effectiveness temozolomide treatment glioma . Before treatment , complete physical exam blood ( around 2 tablespoon ) collect routine test . You either magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan compute tomography ( CT ) scan brain . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . You meet study dietician . The dietician give write instruction make food plan base need . The instruction food plan help maintain methionine-free ( reduce ) diet study . During study , participant receive standard chemotherapy temozolomide mouth day bedtime 7 day Days 8 14 22 28 , every 28 day , 4 week This 4-week period call cycle chemotherapy . This 4 week cycle repeat long disease get bad . During treatment , ask maintain methionine free diet Days 1 - 7 Days 15 - 21 . During period methionine free diet , consume `` shake '' contain Hominex-2® . The Hominex-2® shake nutritionally complete easy prepare . You give instruction maintain methionine-free diet . All participant enrol study consume methionine free diet 1 week , alternate temozolomide chemotherapy 1 week . The participant switch methionine `` replete '' diet 1 week take chemotherapy . This diet chemotherapy schedule continue long treatment effective tolerable . This replete diet contain methionine . The dietician record eat make sure eat right amount methionine period . This 4-week schedule repeat long study . If experience intolerable side effect disease get bad , take study doctor discus treatment option . During treatment , blood ( around 1 tablespoon ) collect every 2 week routine test . Every 4 week first 16 week every 8 week rest study , check visit . At visit , complete physical exam blood collect ( around 1 tablespoon ) routine test . You also dietary consultation . Every 8 week study , either MRI scan CT scan brain . If doctor feel necessary , test may do often may test need care . This investigational study . Methionine restriction diet ( Hominex®-2 Amino Acid-Modified Medical Food ) approve FDA nutrition support child adult vitamin B6-nonresponsive homocystinuria . However , use study investigational . Temozolomide approve FDA treatment brain tumor commercially available . The use combination experimental . Forty-four participant take part study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically proven glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . 2 . Unequivocal evidence tumor recurrence progression MRI ( CT brain patient undergo MRI ) . Radiotherapy ( without radiosensitizing drug ) must complete past . The early patient enrol study radiotherapy 14 day . The scan do prior study entry document progression review primary investigator document tumor volume change provide gross assessment growth rate . 3 . Patients may : ) prior chemotherapy , b ) 1 prior adjuvant chemotherapy , c ) 1 prior adjuvant chemotherapy follow 1 regimen recurrent disease , ) 1 2 prior chemotherapy regimens recurrent progressive tumor . 4 . All patient must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study keep policy hospital . 5 . Enrollment MRI CT scan brain must perform within 14 day registration . Patients undergone recent resection recurrent progressive tumor eligible assessment response long residual enhance evaluable disease document appropriate neuroimaging patient recover effect surgery . Patients surgery residual enhancing disease still eligible enrollment , assessable time progression , response . 6 . Patients must life expectancy &gt; 8 week . 7 . Patients must Karnofsky performance status &gt; = 60 ( Karnofsky Performance Scale ) . 8 . Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy and/or least 2 week vincristine , 6 week nitrosoureas , 3 week procarbazine administration . Patients must recover toxic effect cytotoxic drug may receive must 1 week completion noncytotoxic drug therapy ( e.g . 13cisretinoic acid , thalidomide , tamoxifen , etc. ) . For patient previously treat temozolomide , may enroll start diet even 1 day last temozolomide dose . 9 . Patients must adequate bone marrow function ( ANC &gt; = 1,500/mm3 platelet count &gt; = 100,000/mm3 ) , adequate liver function ( SGPT alkaline phosphatase = &lt; 2 time normal , bilirubin = &lt; 1.5 mg % ) , adequate renal function ( BUN creatinine = &lt; 1.5 time institutional normal ) prior start therapy . 10 . All acute toxic effect ( exclude neurotoxicity alopecia ) prior therapy must resolve Common Toxicity Criteria ( CTC ) grade = &lt; 1 . 11 . Patients eligible trial require resection tumor may begin dietary restriction component therapy prior surgery providing time surgery great 6 day . In patient , tissue collect surgery analysed effect treatment . After surgery , patient resume ad lib diet anywhere 514 day prior reinitiation dietary methionine restriction dose level continuance trial . 1 . Patients history cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix ) , unless complete remission therapy disease minimum 3 year . 2 . Patients one follow condition may participate study : ) active infection ; b ) pregnancy and/or disagree practice adequate contraception ; c ) disease obscure toxicity dangerously alter drug metabolism ; ) serious intercurrent medical illness .</criteria>
