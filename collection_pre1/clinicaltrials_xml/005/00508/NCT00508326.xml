	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Administered HAI Patients With Advanced Cancer Dominant Liver Involvement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paclitaxel design work block mechanism cell division cancer cell , cause die . Before start study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete medical history physical exam , include measurement height , weight , vital sign ( blood pressure , temperature , breathe rate , heart rate ) . You neurological evaluation evaluate strength nerve function . You ask report pinprick thin brush feel apply skin . About 2 tablespoon blood urine sample collect routine test . Women able child must negative urine pregnancy test . If eligible take part study , begin take study drug cycle 28 day . You hospitalize receive chemotherapy . The night hospital admission , receive fluid ( normal saline ) vein help decrease risk kidney side effect chemotherapy . The morning admission hospital , take interventional radiology suite , catheter ( thin plastic tube ) place groin area advance liver . You must bedrest entire time catheter place . After procedure , go Nuclear Medicine , test call `` flow study '' carry confirm right position catheter . After return room , nurse start chemotherapy . You receive paclitaxel nonstop 24 hour catheter ( thin plastic tube ) artery carry blood liver . You repeat procedure every month . The catheter carefully tap move prevent come receive chemotherapy . You ask lie flat back treatment take place . In case , catheter remove immediately chemotherapy infusion complete . In case , catheter remain longer . You bedrest catheter remove . When catheter pull , pressure apply groin 15 minute . The catheter remove someone experienced procedure . The catheter place removed cycle chemotherapy . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw blood count liver function test , dose , sure researcher safely give paclitaxel . You see doctor advance practitioner every day hospital . You hospitalize 3-5 day recovery immediate chemotherapy-related side effect . The charge hospitalization bill insurance carrier . You continue receive chemotherapy every 28 day , unless disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Every 2 month end participation study , scan see tumor grow shrink blood work ( 3 teaspoon ) perform safety test . These test perform doctor 's office result fax study doctor M. D. Anderson . In addition , ask call research nurse charge study 713-745-1042 report health status every week 30 day last dose drug start new course therapy . This investigational study . The chemotherapy give FDA approve . The cost medication bill insurance company . About 59 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
