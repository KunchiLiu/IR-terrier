	<brief_summary>The primary aim project test efficacy inpatient congestive heart failure ( CHF ) educational intervention compare usual care among inpatient Griffin Hospital , largely draw population Naugatuck Valley Connecticut . The educational intervention utilize : - write educational material suitable patient low health literacy - alternative write material ( e.g. , video- audiotape ) may effectively communicate health information elderly patient low health literacy - one-on-one educational session nurse patient educator . The educational session use framework guideline provide America Medical Association ( AMA ) improve communication healthcare provider low health literacy patient . The investigator hypothesize CHF patient receive educational intervention few hospital readmission death usual care group . The investigator hypothesize patient low health literacy derive benefit intervention patient higher literacy . The secondary aim project : - ass whether patient education usual care group differ post-discharge CHF knowledge satisfaction hospital care . Compared usual care , investigator hypothesize CHF patient receive educational intervention well knowledge CHF satisfy care receive hospital . The potential impact propose project may increase disease knowledge health literacy , improve adherence CHF treatment . This , turn , may contribute improved medical outcome reduce hospital readmission CHF patient . In addition , preliminary study provide evidence promise educational intervention suitable patient low health literacy , th investigator endeavor test intervention ethnically diverse population throughout Connecticut .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Variables Measures We assess health literacy Short Test Functional Health Literacy Adults ( STOFHLA ) . The STOFHLA brief version widely use instrument , Test Functional Health Literacy Adults ( TOFHLA ) measure patient ' ability comprehend situation often encounter health care set ; e.g. , read registration form instruction diagnostic test . It 36-item read comprehension test write 14-point font require 7 minute complete . Primary Outcome The primary outcome readmission death cause within 90 day discharge . This outcome ascertain : 1 ) review electronic write medical record identify patient re-admitted Griffin Hospital ; 2 ) monitoring obituary ; 3 ) conduct three-month post-discharge follow-up phone call determine patient admit elsewhere since discharge Griffin . Secondary outcome - Change knowledge CHF study enrollment two week post-discharge measure Knowledge CHF Questionnaire . - Patient satisfaction hospital care examine two week post-discharge 27-item Hospital Consumer Assessment Health Plans Survey ( HCAHPS ) Telephone Survey Instrument . - Feedback educational material obtain narrative patient . Other variables interest Through review electronic write medical record , ascertain subject characteristic include demographic socioeconomic factor disease-related variable Procedures Following IRB review approval , Dr. Dorothea Wild , study co-investigator , review screen new admission identify potentially eligible patient . Within 24 hour admission , contact attending record request permission enroll patient study ; permission grant , Dr. Wild approach patient describe study obtain consent participate . Obtaining consent Dr. Wild obtain write informed consent patient agree participate . She inform patient : 1 ) receive either standard educational material provide Hospital CHF patient intensive educational intervention develop study ; 2 ) 50 % chance assign group ; 3 ) know whether receive standard intensive education . Randomization , allocation concealment , blind Dr. Haq Nawaz use software develop Johns Hopkins Division Oncology Biostatistics randomize patient usual care educational intervention group . Dr. Nawaz keep group assignment consecutively number opaque envelops reveal assignment nurse patient educator intervention assign . All study personnel collect manage data remain blind study assignment . Patients also blind group assignment throughout trial . Each patient group receive educational intervention : - view HFSA videotape ; - receive copy `` Managing Your Health Heart Failure '' review hospital take home ; - receive pre-printed chart record daily weigh , evidence swelling , whether s/he take prescribed diuretic , instruction inform doctor weight swell problem ; - receive copy `` Following Low-Salt Diet '' review take home ; - participate 45 - 60 minute one-on-one session nurse patient educator review information use framework 6-step strategy recommend AMA ; - encourage take written/pictorial note augment material . The nurse educator elicit feedback patient quality accessibility write material . Each patient educational intervention usual care group receive review staff nurse : - write information diagnosis treatment CHF design low literacy patient ; - pre-printed discharge instruction sheet explain patient 's medication dietary instruction , identifies symptoms report primary care physician , provide physician follow-up appointment . Post-discharge assessment The data manager administer Knowledge CHF Questionnaire measure patient satisfaction telephone two week post-discharge . She also regularly review obituary place follow-up phone call three month post-discharge ask subsequent hospitalization , include facility Griffin . Data safety monitoring Because propose study involve educational intervention , potential risk participation minimal . Nonetheless , PI , Dr. Calvocoressi , one co-investigator , Dr. Nawaz , conduct monthly data safety review assess risk monitor adverse event . An additional review conduct follow report adverse event . We also assess whether event attribute research ( i.e. , definite , possible , unrelated ) . Any adverse event grade 2 higher immediately report Griffin Hospital IRB funding agency . Data Analysis Plan The analysis plan include univariate , bivariate , multivariate analysis conduct SAS software . We conduct analysis accord intent-to-treat principle use 0.05 ( two-tailed ) level significance . Assessing subject characteristic adequacy randomization procedure We examine whether control intervention group significantly differ subject characteristic ( e.g. , socio-demographic factor , feature disease , involvement caregiver ) may impact relationship treatment group study outcome . For categorical variable , use Chi square test purpose ; continuous variable , use Student 's t-test . Primary outcome We use t-test proportion examine difference proportion patient educational usual care group re-hospitalized die within 90 day discharge . In addition , employ logistic regression examine whether educational usual care group differ re-hospitalization/death ( yes/no ) 90 day adjust pertinent covariates . We conduct secondary analysis test robustness finding . That analysis examine whether time re-hospitalization/death differs educational usual care group use log rank test proportional hazard ( Cox ) model . We examine interaction treatment group ( educational versus usual care ) health literacy ( i.e. , low versus adequate ) relation readmission/death 90 day post-discharge assess whether impact educational intervention differ health literacy level . Secondary outcome We examine difference educational usual care group knowledge CHF study enrollment follow discharge calculate continuous change score base two administration knowledge CHF questionnaire . We use paired t-test bivariate analysis . To control covariates , include knowledge score time enrollment , conduct linear regression analysis . The difference educational usual care group satisfaction treatment , measure post-discharge continuous scale , examine use t-test linear regression adjust covariates . Power Sample Size Calculations We base calculation primary outcome , proportion CHF patient educational usual care group either die re-admitted hospital cause within 90 day discharge . A review Griffin Hospital database past three year indicate 33.5 % CHF patient meet inclusion criterion re-admitted Griffin Hospital within 90 day . Though patient population quite stable CHF patient need readmission probably return facility , assume additional 5 % admit elsewhere 90 day follow discharge Griffin Hospital . In addition , base previously conduct study educational intervention CHF ( 19 ) , expect additional 6 % die within period . Thus , base calculation 45 % usual care group experience all-cause readmission death within 90 day discharge . For educational group base calculation 25 % absolute decrease event time period ( i.e. , 20 % re-admitted die ) . This clinically meaningful decrease consistent difference readmissions/deaths control educational intervention group recent CHF outpatient study . We use follow formula calculation : n = { [ p1 ( q1 ) + p2 ( q2 ) ] / ( p2-p1 ) } ( f ( alpha , beta ) ) n = number subject need group p1 = percentage patient control group re-hospitalized q1 = percentage patient control group re-hospitalized p2 = percentage patient intervention group re-hospitalized q2 = percentage patient control group re-hospitalized f ( alpha , beta ) = 7.9 alpha = .05 ( two-sided ) beta = .20 The number patient per group need detect 25 % decrease 90 day all-cause readmission/death 52 ; total sample need study 104 . Assuming 10 % patient refuse participate lose follow-up , need enroll 116 eligible patient . Over past three year , , average 174 patient admit Griffin annually primary diagnosis CHF . Seventy-three patient per annum would exclude participation ( e.g. , discharge skilled nursing facility , ill participate ) , leave average 101 patient per year meeting inclusion criterion . We , therefore , able recruit 116 subject need study approximately 14 month .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Heart Failure</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Eligible consecutive patient age 50 year admit primary diagnosis CHF Griffin Hospital invite participate regardless age , gender , race , education level . Because dietary medication noncompliance affect patient systolic diastolic heart failure , investigator include patient condition , regardless ejection fraction . The investigator exclude patient clinical condition communication barrier would limit ability participate and/or benefit educational intervention . The investigator also exclude patient whose planned discharge another hospital structure set medical personnel responsible care ( e.g. , skilled nursing facility ) , thus limit ability implement largely selfdirected selfcare regimen upon leave hospital . In addition , investigator exclude patient telephone , therefore , contact obtain postdischarge followup data . Specific exclusion criterion include : A diagnosis dementia severe mental disorder ( e.g. , acute delirium , psychosis ) Clinical instability need transfer another hospital acute intervention ( e.g. , experience cardiogenic shock , need valve surgery acute coronary intervention ) Terminal illness intubation Moderate severe uncorrected vision hearing problem Inability speak English provide inform consent Lack access telephone Planned discharge structure facility ( e.g. , skilled nursing facility , intermediate care facility )</criteria>
