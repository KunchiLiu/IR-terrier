	<criteria>Signed informed consent ; Female ≥18 year ; Pathology histologically confirm invasive breast cancer stage IIIb/c stage IV disease ; • If recurrent disease restrict solitary lesion , neoplastic nature confirm cytology histology . Documented overexpression Her2 ( ErbB2 ) IHC 3+ FISH positive , primary metastatic tumor tissue require enrollment study ; local test central laboratory test determined country residence . NB . Approximately , 51 subject enrol single stage design test efficacy woman China Hong Kong . Due fact trastuzumab commonly prescribed China Hong Kong , current study allow 40 % subject trastuzumab naïve enrol . Prior therapy must include minimum taxane and/or anthracycline may include trastuzumab available ; prior regimen limit except capecitabine ErbB1/Erbb2 inhibitor trastuzumab . Chemo regimen requirement follow : Taxane contain regimen least 4 cycle &lt; 4 cycle provide disease progression treatment limit toxicity occur taxane Anthracycline contain regimen least 4 cycle &lt; 4 cycle provide disease progression treatment limit toxicity occur anthracycline Taxanes Anthracyclines may administer concurrently separately Prior treatment may contain trastuzumab alone combination chemotherapy adjuvant , locally advanced metastatic set patient must fail treatment Prior treatment capecitabine permit unless 6 month elapse since last dose capecitabine subject free capecitabine relate toxicity Prior therapy ErbB1 and/or ErbB2 inhibitor , trastuzumab permit Other prior chemoregimens list unlimited . For subject whose disease ER+ and/or PR+ one follow criterion meet . Subjects receive hormonal therapy longer benefit therapy hormonal treatment must stop first dose investigational treatment Subjects visceral disease require chemotherapy ( eg. , subject liver lung metastasis ) Rapidly progress life threaten disease , determine investigator Subjects stable CNS metastasis ( asymptomatic systemic steroid anticonvulsant least 3 month ) eligible Measurable lesion ( ) accord RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) ; Radiotherapy palliative treatment painful metastatic disease permit must stop within 2 week prior initiation investigational treatment . All subject must recover radiotherapy related toxicity prior initiation investigational treatment . The site radiotherapy must use site measurable disease ; Cardiac ejection fraction within institutional range normal measure echocardiogram . MUGA scan accept case echocardiogram perform inconclusive ; ECOG Performance Status 0 1 ; Life expectancy ≥ 12 week ; Able swallow retain oral medication ; Women potential child must willing practice acceptable method birth control study ; Willing complete screening assessment outline protocol ; Adequate organ function define Table Baseline Laboratory Values Pregnant lactate female anytime study Subjects nonmeasurable metastatic site disease per RECIST , ( e.g . bone metastasis , pleural effusion , ascites , etc . ; Planned concurrent anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , hormonal therapy ) take investigational treatment ; Unresolved unstable , serious toxicity prior administration another investigational drug and/or prior cancer treatment ; Malabsorption syndrome , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function , resection stomach small bowel . Subjects ulcerative colitis also exclude ; History malignancy . However , subject diseasefree 5 year , subject history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer successfully treat situ carcinoma , eligible ; Concurrent disease condition would make subject inappropriate study participation , serious medical disorder would interfere subject 's safety ; Uncontrolled infection ; Dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent ;</criteria>
