	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate safety efficacy Lumax HF-T optimize interventricular delay biventricular pacing ( OPT ) non-inferior Lumax HF-T simultaneous biventricular pacing ( SIM ) patient heart failure require cardiac resynchronization therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interventricular Delay Lumax HF-T Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize , double-blinded , crossover , multi-center , prospective trial . The study consist 122 subject require treatment advanced heart failure cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) back-up defibrillation capability . Eligible patient successfully implant BIOTRONIK Lumax HF-T CRT-D system receive simultaneous biventricular pace minimum 90 day prior enrollment . The 90-day period require allow treatment effect CRT therapy SIM complete ensure patient receive stable optimal CHF medical regimen . The patient interventricular delay feature program standardized optimization procedure . Patients , along study personnel evaluate study endpoint measure , blind type CRT therapy deliver study follow-up period .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Meet indication therapy Successfully implant BIOTRONIK Lumax HFT CRTD system receive SIM minimum 30 day prior enrollment . A successful implantation define measure LV pace threshold allows minimum 1volt safety margin without phrenic nerve stimulation time enrollment . Treated stable optimal CHF medication , include ACE inhibitor ( ACEI ) Angiotensin Receptor Blocker ( ARB ) therapeutic dose 1 month prior enrollment , tolerate , Beta Blocker approve indicated HF 3 month prior enrollment , tolerate , stable dosage 1 month prior enrollment . If patient intolerant ACEI beta blocker , document evidence must available . Eplerenone require dosage stability 1 month prior enrollment . Diuretics may use necessary keep patient euvolemic . Therapeutic equivalence ACEI substitution allow within enrollment stability timeliness . Stable define 100 % increase 50 % decrease dose . Age â‰¥ 18 year Able understand nature study give inform consent Able complete testing require clinical protocol , include 6minute walk test QOL questionnaire Available followup visit regular basis investigational site Meet one contraindication Have life expectancy le 6 month Expected receive heart transplantation within 6 month Have 1 CHFrelated hospitalization within past 30 day Currently receive IV inotropic medication Chronic atrial fibrillation Enrolled another cardiovascular pharmacological clinical investigation , except FDA require postmarket registry Any condition prevent patient able perform require test Presence another lifethreatening , underlie illness separate cardiac disorder</criteria>
