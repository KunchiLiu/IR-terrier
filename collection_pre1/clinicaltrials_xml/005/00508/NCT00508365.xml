All subject must able safely ( opinion Investigator ) withdrawn downtitrated antihypertensive treatment ( ) transition lisinopril 10 mg OD twoweek runin phase . Any clinically relevant abnormality identify screen history , physical laboratory examination , medical condition circumstance make volunteer unsuitable participation study Subject metabolize carvedilol poorly base CYP2D6 genotype determine screen Subject persistent hyperkalemia history hyperkalemia result either Type IV RTA ( renal tubular acidosis ) previous treatment ACE inhibitor , ARB renin inhibitor . Subject malignant ( accelerate ) hypertension , history malignant hypertension , history secondary form hypertension Subject advance hypertensive retinopathy ( Keith Wagner Grade IV ) Subject history hepatic impairment ( characterize prolong prothrombin time/low concentration albumin ) and/or renal insufficiency ( subject estimate CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min CockroftGault must exclude ) . CrCL = [ 140ageCr ] [ weight/70 ] x 0.85 ( female ) ; Cr mg/dL ; Weight kg Subject treat diabetes mellitus Subject history angioedema Subject treatment 3 antihypertensive medication .

Standard vitamins and/or daily multivitamin permit , however herbal vitamin exclude . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) precede runin period Subject mean sit SBP ≥ 180 mmHg screen assessment ( one set repeat measurement permit per approval medical monitor ) . Documented history low blood pressure within six month screen visit ( average sit SBP &lt; 110 mm Hg and/or DBP / &lt; 50 mm Hg ) blood pressure value time screen ( one set repeat measurement permit per approval medical monitor ) . Orthostatic hypotension diagnose screening ( orthostatic hypotension define reduction systolic blood pressure 20 mmHg and/or reduction diastolic blood pressure 10 mmHg stand vs. supine measurement ) Subject follow condition : uncontrollable symptomatic arrhythmia ; unstable angina sick sinus syndrome second third degree heart block ( unless treat permanent , function pacemaker ) bradycardia ( seated heart rate &lt; 55 bpm ) ( one repeat measurement permit per approval medical monitor ) ; history myocardial infarction , history stroke within 1 year screening . subject , history atrial fibrillation Any follow abnormality 12lead ECG screening : complete RBBB LBBB evidence second thirddegree AV block pathological Qwaves ( Qwave wider 0.04 sec depth great 0.40.5 mV ) abnormalities investigator feel could concern patient take βadrenergic block agent Donation blood excess 500 mL within 56day period include estimate 150 mL blood drawn study History asthma , COPD and/or hypersensitivity β adrenergic block agent History sensitivity carvedilol , lisinopril , alphablockers , betablockers ACE inhibitor History sensitivity study medication component thereof History anaphylaxis anaphylactoid reaction severe allergic response drug History regular alcohol consumption exceed 7 drinks/week woman 14 drinks/week men ( 1 drink = 5 ounce wine 12 ounce beer 1.5 ounce hard liquor ) within 6 month screen Unanticipated positive urine drug screen ( UDS ) screening .
