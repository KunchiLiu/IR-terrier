	<brief_summary>The hypothesis study bed rest diabetic patient result deterioration metabolic control ( primarily glucose ) . Specific aim : 1 . To determine change metabolic control type 2 diabetic individual three day bed rest compare three day activity ; 2 . To determine rate progression deterioration metabolic control magnitude decrease ; 3 . To assess whether anticipated deterioration metabolic control effect several parameter glucose metabolism , include hyperglycemia hypoglycemia ; 4 . To determine effect bed rest surrogate marker atherosclerosis , plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 ( PAI1 ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , homocysteine . 5 . To compare effect 48 hour bed rest orthostatic response type 2 diabetic patient , healthy non-diabetics . 6 . To make recommendation diabetic community prevent metabolic deterioration 3 day hospitalization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal diabetic patient maintain metabolic control close normal possible prevent short long term complication diabetes . Surgery type present unique challenge diabetic patient two factor tend worsen metabolic control 1 ) stress actual surgery 2 ) bed rest follow surgery . Data clearly show surgery increase counter regulatory hormone ( epinephrine , glucagon , growth hormone cortisol ) . What study effect bed rest per se metabolic control . This surprising many study normal healthy people demonstrate simple bed rest increase insulin resistance worsens metabolic control . The propose study define metabolic effect simple , three-day bed rest metabolic control healthy type 2 diabetic volunteer evaluate orthostatic response bed rest . All study do inpatient , General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) . All volunteer stop oral antidiabetic medication enter GCRC . They place intravenous insulin prevent severe metabolic deterioration hyperglycemia . The amount insulin give maintain metabolic control one measure effect bed rest metabolic control . Experimental Design Methods . A crossover study twenty healthy normal twenty healthy type 2 diabetic subject utilized . Each subject admit GCRC night prior begin study order insure metabolic stability start protocol . Each subject stay GCRC three full day ( three night ) time admission . Each subject admit two separate occasion , separate least two week interval . A diagram protocol give : The primary difference two admission amount physical activity allow subject . On normal physical activity GCRC admission , subject encourage stay bed his/her usual bedtime . All procedures meal take place GCRC time subject encourage walk around hospital carry normal activity daily live . On bed rest GCRC admission , subject encourage stay bed much possible use bedside commode . A tilt test perform morning first day hospitalization 48 hour later . The test do normal activity admission . All medication volunteer usually take home continue hospital . The volunteer GCRC three day : Day 1 , Day 2 , Day 3 . The following test do three day : Day 1 - Blood drawn fast lipid , glucose , insulin , C-peptide well surrogate marker atherosclerosis include PAI-1 , IL-6 , homocysteine , fibrinogen , CRP . In addition , tilt table test do assess autonomic response activity bedrest . Day 2 - Blood drawn fast lipid , glucose , insulin , C-peptide well surrogate marker atherosclerosis include PAI-1 , IL-6 , homocysteine , fibrinogen , CRP . Day 3 - Blood drawn fast lipid , glucose , insulin , C-peptide well surrogate marker atherosclerosis include PAI-1 , IL-6 , homocysteine , fibrinogen , CRP . In addition , tilt table test do assess autonomic response activity bed rest .</detailed_description>
