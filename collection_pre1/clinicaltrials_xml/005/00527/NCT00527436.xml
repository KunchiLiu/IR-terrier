	<brief_summary>Rationale Experimental data indicate inverse relation intake omega-3 fatty acid ( 'fish oil ' ) , primarily form eicosapentanoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexanoic acid ( DHA ) , risk develop cardiovascular disease healthy adult . Mechanisms underlie cardioprotective effect unknown may involve favorable influence various biomarkers cardiovascular risk . In project determine favorable effect omega-3 's occur old healthy adult , age primary risk factor cardiovascular disease development . Key Objectives To determine effect chronic ( 12 week ) oral omega-3 fatty acid supplementation biomarkers cardiovascular risk young old adult . We hypothesize omega-3 fatty acid supplementation exert positive effect biomarkers cardiovascular risk . Study Population Healthy young ( 18-40 year age ) old ( 50-79 ) men woman . Major Inclusion &amp; Exclusion Criteria Subjects must healthy ( assessed history physical examination : non obese BMI &lt; 30 : normotensive BP &lt; 140/90 mmHg ) men woman currently take medication could influence result . Women must non-pregnant . Normal liver enzyme ( ALT AST ) . Individuals allergy corn exclude . Allocation Groups Randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled . Summary Procedures Measurements make baseline repeat ~12 week begin daily oral ingestion either low dose high dose fish oil capsule placebo</brief_summary>
