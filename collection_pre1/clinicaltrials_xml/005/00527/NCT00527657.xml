	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high safe dose lomustine ( CCNU , CeeNUTM ) give temozolomide ( TemodarTM ) thalidomide ( ThalomidTM ) treatment metastatic melanoma spread brain . The safety effectiveness combination therapy also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide , Thalidomide , Lomustine ( TTL ) Melanoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Temozolomide work block tumor cell 's ability grow . Lomustine also chemotherapy drug work kill tumor cell . Studies show lomustine temozolomide give together , decrease amount certain protein , allow tumor cell easily kill . Thalidomide drug alters immune system . may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may decrease prevent growth cancer cell . If find eligible take part study , begin treatment . All 3 drug take mouth home . Each treatment cycle last 8 week . You take temozolomide day 6 week follow two week . The best time take temozolomide around bedtime , since must eat least 1 hour 1 hour taking . The number capsule take base height weight . You must swallow temozolomide capsule time 8 ounce water ( chew ) . You take thalidomide every day entire 8-week cycle . Thalidomide also take near bedtime , usually 30 45 minute temozolomide dose . If 70 year age , start set dose take dose throughout study . If age 70 , dose start low increase every 2 week take prearranged set dose age 70 take . Your doctor watch side effect dose increase may keep low dose necessary . In first group patient ( 3-6 patient per group , total 18 patient ) enrol , new group participant give high dose lomustine previous group high safe dose lomustine find 18 patient enrol . Responses dose evaluate . Once best dose find , future participant receive dose lomustine . You take 2 dos lomustine every 8 week . You take first dose lomustine Day 1 8-week cycle . You take second dose , half big first dose , Day 29 ( day first 4 week ) 8-week cycle . The dose lomustine also base height weight . Lomustine swallow chew . During treatment , every 2-4 week , complete physical exam blood drawn test ( 1-2 tablespoon ) . These test let doctor know treatment change , briefly interrupt , stop . Women able child must negative pregnancy test every week first 4 week regular menstruation every 2 week period irregular . At end 8 week , x-rays scan do see tumor respond . If size get small , may continue treatment . You may stay treatment long severe side effect tumor either stay size get small . Treatment stop tumor get big . If withdraw study reason contact phone every three month learn health wise . This investigational study . None 3 drug use study approve FDA treatment melanoma . Temozolomide approve treatment brain cancer . Thalidomide yet approve treatment cancer . Lomustine approve treatment brain tumor Hodgkin 's disease . All drug commercially available . Their use together study experimental . Up 18 patient take part Phase I portion study , another 30 patient Phase II progress , 48 patient total . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologic Documentation : Histologic cytologic diagnosis distant metastatic melanoma clinical evidence brain metastasis . 2 . Pts must brain lesion =/ &gt; 1.0cm long dimension MRI spiral CT , MRI feasible &gt; 0.5cm MRI 3D image . Pts with/without extracranial disease eligible . Measurable extracranial disease require . Lesions consider nonmeasurable include : &lt; 1.0 cm MRI Spiral CT , Bone lesion , Leptomeningeal disease , Ascites , Pleural/pericardial effusion , Lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis , Abdominal mass confirm follow image technique , Cystic lesion , lesion previously irradiate area , unless new growth document . 3 . Age &gt; /= 18 year age . 4 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status : 0 1 5 . No 1 prior chemotherapy regimen prior chemotherapy brain metastasis . No prior treatment continuous daily dose temozolomide ; prior immunotherapy surgical resection permit . Patients prior history whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) permit provide measurable lesion document growth post radiation new disease . 6 . ( # 5 continue ) Progression lesion treat WBRT must show 2 post treatment brain image least 3 week apart . Progression disease also consider patient increase lesion per MRI brain obtain 4 week WBRT complete compare baseline MRI obtain less 1 week prior start radiation . Lesions treat SRS must respond progress . 7 . The following time period must elapse since prior therapy : 3 week since surgical resection stereotactic radiosurgery ; 4weeks since prior whole brain radiation therapy ; 6 week since prior nitrosureas mitomycin C. Biologic agent use adjuvant vaccine cellular therapy require 4week wash period patient meet eligibility criterion . 8 .
