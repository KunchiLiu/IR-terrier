	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : 1 . To compare efficacy 1.5T vs. 3T T1 T2-weighted MR image sequence detection evaluation liver lesion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Signa Excite 3.0 T MRI Excite Detection Characterization Liver Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnetic resonance image take scanner different magnetic field strength . The current practice UTMDACC perform exams 1.5 Tesla . Tesla unit strength magnetic field . This study compare image take standard 1.5 Tesla ( T ) magnetic field newer 3.0T magnetic field . You already schedule receive standard 1.5 T MR liver area request doctor . As part study , ask return separate date similar exam perform Signal 3.0T Excite MR scanner . You return within two week period date first MRI examination . The examination perform machine look similar 1.5T scanner . It also take amount time examination 1.5T . The image take scanner evaluate compare . After second scan , participation study . If new finding identify new scan doctor notify . This investigational study . The 3.0T scan perform free charge . A total 20 patient take part study All enrol UTMDACC . This protocol partially fund research grant General Electric Medical Systems ( GEMS ) .</detailed_description>
