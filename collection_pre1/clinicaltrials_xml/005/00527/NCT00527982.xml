	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To examine effect celecoxib treatment histological response , marker proliferation ( Ki-67 ) , apoptosis . Secondary endpoint include time second primary recurrence survival . 2 . To examine toxicity associate celecoxib administration patient previously treat Head Neck Head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) Non-small-cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order enroll trial , must also enrol Protocol 2003-0424 . The study procedure test part study procedure test part Protocol 2003-0424 . Even though procedure test describe consent consent Protocol 2003-0424 , describe procedure test do . For example , study Protocol 2003-0424 require complete physical exam begin treatment . In case , one physical exam count study . Celecoxib drug slow production chemical body cause inflammation . Celecoxib work interfere action chemical cyclooxygenase , chemical involve inflammation . It believe product chemical cause inflammation may involve cancer development . Before treatment start , complete physical exam , include measurement height , weight , blood pressure , vital sign . You blood sample draw routine blood test ( 3 teaspoon ) research purpose ( 4 teaspoon ) . Women able child must negative pregnancy test ( blood urine ) . You also chest x-ray CT scan chest . You also bronchoscopy ( tissue sample lung ) begin study lab analysis . For procedure , give drug relax . Then , local anesthetic spray nose throat numb area . A slim , flexible tube light place nose mouth lung . Tweezers feed tube collect lung tissue ( biopsy ) sample 6 different place lung . During bronchoscopy procedure , complete inspection airway perform . Any suspicious area see white-light autofluorescence bronchoscopy identify biopsy brushing perform evaluate whether pre-cancerous tissue present . You also bronchial brush next biopsy site . In bronchial brushing , small brush feed tube lung sample lung tissue gently scrap . When biopsy brush do , bronchial lavage ( bronchial washing ) . In bronchial lavage , small amount water ( 4 tablespoon ) spray lung suction tube . This fluid use collect additional tissue mucous sample . In addition , sputum ( saliva ) sample take inside cheek scrap ( buccal sample ) . If HNSCC , also laryngoscopy . In laryngoscopy , light tube place throat larynx check . The back throat spray anesthetic procedure make procedure comfortable . In study randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two group . Participants one group receive celecoxib . Participants group receive treatment . Current standard practice individual therapy early stage NSCLC HNSCC follow-up ( treatment ) . You 2 1 chance assign treatment group . That mean 2 every 3 participant study assign treatment group . If assign treatment group take celecoxib mouth two divided dos least 8 hour apart every day . Your study doctor tell exactly many pill take day . You take celecoxib 12 month . You take study intolerable side effect occur disease come back . If assign treatment ( celecoxib ) group , physical exam physician nurse month 3 , 6 , 12 first year treatment . If assign `` treatment '' group , nurse contact phone every 3 month first year study see physical exam either physician nurse every 6 month . During first year , participant blood sample take clinic visit routine blood test ( 3 teaspoon ) research purpose ( 4 teaspoon ) . In addition , participant chest x-ray chest CT month 6 12 . All participant also bronchoscopy provide sputum , saliva , buccal smear sample 12 month . If treat HNSCC , laryngoscopy 12 month . After first year , follow minimum 2 year maximum 6 year . You physical exam 24 36 month . You blood draw ( 3 teaspoon routine test 4 teaspoon research purpose ) , chest x-ray chest CT 18 , 24 , 30 36 month . After 36 month , physical exam physician nurse every 6 month 6 year . Every 12 month physical exam do physician . The physical exam do nurse . You blood drawn routine test ( 3 teaspoon ) research purpose ( 4 teaspoon ) every 12 month . This research study include two bronchoscopies do one year apart . These bronchoscopies do primarily research purpose unlikely provide information useful individual treatment . These bronchoscopies risk associate . These risk describe section 4 informed consent document . Recent research early stage NSCLC indicate adjuvant chemotherapy surgery increase length time person may survive length time cancer recurs . However , adjuvant chemotherapy also side effect severe rare case fatal . If surgery NSCLC wish receive adjuvant chemotherapy , may enroll study Protocol 2003-0424 complete adjuvant chemotherapy . As part study provide sample lung tissue , saliva , blood , scraping inside cheek . Fluid mucous collect bronchoscopies also collect . These sample study scientist learn gene protein people treat early NSCLC HNSCC . The sample also use grow cell culture use test chemotherapy drug . These cell culture also use learn gene protein . This investigational study . Celecoxib commonly use drug approve FDA treatment arthritis , colon polyp , pain . The use celecoxib help prevent cancer approve FDA research . A total 70 individual take part multicenter study . Up 50 enrol UT MD Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
