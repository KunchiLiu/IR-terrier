	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray type radiation kill tumor cell . Giving radiation therapy different way may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study well partial breast radiation therapy work treat woman undergo breast-conserving therapy early stage breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Partial Breast Radiation Therapy Treating Women Undergoing Breast-Conserving Therapy Early Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine cosmetic outcome result partial breast irradiation use two different technique . - To determine patient satisfaction partial breast irradiation pertain overall treatment experience measure questionnaire . - To determine patient factor limit patient 's suitability receive partial breast irradiation deliver particular technique . - To evaluate wound heal overall complication rate partial breast irradiation . - To determine ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate tumor bed recurrence rate . OUTLINE : Patients undergo partial breast irradiation comprise either MammoSite® brachytherapy twice daily 5-10 day OR 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy twice daily 5-10 day . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
