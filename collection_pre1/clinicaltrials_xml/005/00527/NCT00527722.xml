	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate safety effectiveness Bio-Seal Biopsy Track Plug clinical setting use lung biopsy procedure reduce rate air leak , commonly associate procedure . The Bio-Seal System clear U.S. indication use lung biopsy site marker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Bio-Seal Biopsy Track Plug</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Air leak common problem lung biopsy . Air leak mild severe . Mild air leak monitor chest x-ray may go away . Air leak cause pain require repeat x-ray , case need tube insert chest drainage air . If agree take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) 1of 2 group . Participants one group receive experimental lung plug lung biopsy . Participants group standard lung biopsy without placement plug . There equal chance assign either group . All participant routine lung biopsy perform doctor aid computerize tomography ( CT ) scan . During lung biopsy , needle inserted mass lung use CT guidance . A small needle insert first needle collect sample tissue . If assign receive lung plug , insert track leave biopsy needle remove . The small sampling needle remove , lung plug insert large needle use delivery tool plunger push plug place . The lung plug remain track left large needle remove . Regardless group assign , receive follow-up treatment . The rate air leaks lung biopsy compare 2 group participant . This provide researcher data learn lung plug use patient receive lung biopsy decrease number air leak . Your doctor watch carefully air leak . You chest x-ray 1 hour procedure check air leak . If leak detect , receive normal treatment air leak , include chest x-rays regular basis . If air leak grows , may need chest tube place drainage . It possible may require stay hospital overnight . In extreme case , additional surgery may need stop air leak . Over time , body absorb plug . A final x-ray take 1 month biopsy sure air leak develop . You ask study 30 day . This include time spend hospital biopsy , air leak , entire time spend hospital , need treat . In addition , return doctor day follow biopsy 30 day later chest x-ray look late air leak .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . The patient , legal representative , must understand provide write consent procedure 2 . The patient noncalcified , radiologically suspicious opacity lung nodule , include metastatic lung module , mass least 1.0 cm size ; determine CT scan equip measurement software . Suspicious nodule observe CT scan define noncalcified mass convex border , know stable . Suspicious nodule also define mass demonstrate opacity xray suspicious radiographic clinical mean require biopsy . 3 . The patient must meet medical condition lung biopsy ; 4 . The patient must least 18 year age ; 1 . Patients radiological finding bullous emphysema , bulla locate near intended area biopsy . ( Patients may enter study radiological finding bullous emphysema , long cyst , bleb , bullae area anticipate biopsy , biopsy needle track ) . 2 . Female patient pregnant . Note : patient childbearing potential pregnancy test one week prior biopsy procedure , instruct unprotected sexual intercourse test biopsy procedure complete 3 . Patients uncooperative follow instruction 4 . Patients currently enrol another Investigational New Drug ( IND ) Device Exemption ( IDE ) clinical investigation complete required followup period 5 . Patients tolerate mild sedation , possibly secondary poor respiratory status ; 6 . Patients fungal infection ( Patients know image evidence highly suggestive pulmonary fungal infection )</criteria>
