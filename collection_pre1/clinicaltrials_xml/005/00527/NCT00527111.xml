	<brief_title>Pre-op Rectal ChemoRad +/- Cetuximab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rectal cancer remain significant cause morbidity mortality United States . Standard treatment patient locally advanced rectal cancer generally include combined chemotherapy radiotherapy administer either ( neoadjuvant ) ( adjuvant ) definitive surgical resection . Published data Germany suggest advantage neoadjuvant strategy . Currently , standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimen United States pelvic irradiation administer concurrently 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) give protract venous infusion . However , local recurrence remain problem . Recently complete randomized trial chemoradiotherapy demonstrated local recurrence rate 8-17 % even currently accept standard chemoradiotherapy adequate surgical management . Several recent trial explore use radiotherapy cetuximab good result . Because non-overlapping toxicity profile potentially diverse complimentary mechanism action , combination chemotherapy plus ERBITUX give concurrently pelvic radiotherapy may improve outcome see current standard patient locally advance adenocarcinoma rectum .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Note : Please see Section 8.1 necessary `` Prestudy Assessments '' . A patient eligible inclusion study s/he meet follow criterion : Has histologically confirm diagnosis newly diagnose adenocarcinoma rectum ( tumor within 15 cm anal verge ) . Location tumor ( low 1/3rd vs. middle upper 1/3rd ) pretreatment nodal status ( N0 vs. N1 N2 ) record eCRF . Patients nonmeasurable disease eligible long meet disease requirement criterion well eligibility criterion . Has tumor locally advance ( T3/T4 lymph node positive ) preoperative assessment CT MRI image transrectal ultrasonography . Has evidence distant metastasis radiographic staging Has ECOG Performance Status ( PS ) 01 Is great 18 year age Has adequate marrow organ system function assess follow lab value : White blood cell ( WBC ) count See protocol specific detail Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) See protocol specific detail Hemoglobin See protocol specific detail Total bilirubin See protocol specific detail AST ALT See protocol specific detail Serum creatinine See protocol specific detail Platelet count See protocol specific detail Sexually active woman childbearing potential must use effective method birth control course study , manner risk failure minimize . Prior study enrollment , woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must advise importance avoid pregnancy trial participation potential risk factor unintentional pregnancy . In addition , men enrol study understand risk sexual partner childbearing potential practice effective method birth control . All WOCBP MUST negative pregnancy test within 3 week prior registration ( confirm within 7 day prior first receive investigational product ) . If pregnancy test positive , patient must receive investigational product must enrol study . In addition , WOCBP instruct contact Investigator immediately suspect might pregnant ( eg , miss late menstrual period ) time study participation . The Investigator must immediately notify BMS event confirm pregnancy patient participate study . Has sign Patient Informed Consent Form Has sign Patient Authorization Form A patient exclude study s/he meet follow criterion : Has another disease similar one study ( ie , colon cancer ) Has evidence distant metastasis radiographic staging Has prior treatment current disease Has prior stem cell bone marrow transplant organ transplant exception corneal transplant cadaver bone graft Has history hypersensitivity study treatment Has prior severe infusion reaction monoclonal antibody Has receive prior therapy , time , specifically directly target EGFR pathway Has significant history uncontrolled cardiac disease ; ie , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , recent myocardial infarction ( within prior 6 month ) , uncontrolled congestive heart failure , cardiomyopathy decrease ejection fraction Has evidence CNS involvement ( CNS imaging require study enrollment unless clinically suspect CNS disease present . ) Has serious uncontrolled intercurrent medical psychiatric illness , include serious infection Gilbert 's Syndrome Has history malignancy within last 5 year ( except cure basal cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ uterine cervix ) , could affect diagnosis assessment study drug . Patients , receive prior radiotherapy regional site pelvis , long inclusion criterion meet , could consider enrollment discussion Dr. McCollum .
