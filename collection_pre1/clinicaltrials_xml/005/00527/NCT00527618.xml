	<brief_summary>To compare effect high-dose valacyclovir ( 1 gram orally twice daily ) versus standard-dose acyclovir ( 400 mg orally twice daily ) frequency genital HSV reactivation plasma HIV-1 level among HSV-2/HIV-1 co-infected individual . The investigator hypothesize high-dose valacyclovir result great reduction plasma HIV-1 genital HSV reactivation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Study Effect Dose Herpes Simplex Virus-2 ( HSV-2 ) Suppressive Therapy HSV HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose conduct randomize , open-label , cross-over study 38 individual HIV-1 seropositive HSV-2 seropositive . Both men woman recruit study . Participants must antiretroviral therapy must plan initiate antiretroviral therapy anticipate study period . Participants randomize 1:1 receive acyclovir 400 mg twice daily valacyclovir 1000 mg twice daily . After 12 week initial treatment , participant cross alternative treatment arm 12 week . The treatment period separate 2-week washout period . During first four week treatment period ( i.e . week 1-4 week 15-18 ) , participant provide self-collected genital swabs daily HSV DNA quantification . Each week entire study period plasma sample collect participant HIV-1 RNA quantification . Open-label acyclovir valacyclovir use trial , primary outcome measure ( genital HSV plasma HIV-1 ) unlikely influenced knowledge treatment assignment . However , laboratory staff perform plasma HIV-1 genital HSV measurement aware treatment assignment . Optional Sub-Study A : Sub-study A offer study participant . The purpose sub-study A measure effect valacyclovir twice daily plasma HIV-1 replication .</detailed_description>
