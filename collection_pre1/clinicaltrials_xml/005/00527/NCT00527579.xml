	<brief_title>PET Imaging Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptors Patients With Neurocysticercosis Using F-18FB</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective In endemic region neurocysticercosis common cause adult acquire epilepsy thus important public health problem . The disease cause infection larval form tapeworm , Taenia solium . Although neurocysticercosis common many develop region , increase number patient diagnose developed country mostly due immigration infect individual . The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBR ) clinically useful marker detect neuroinflammation activate microglia inflammatory area express high level PBR . PBR image positron emission tomography ( PET ) use [ ( 11 ) C ] 1- ( 2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl ) -3-isoquinoline carboxamide ( PK11195 ) , provide low level specific signal . Recently develop new ligand , N-fluroacetyl-N- ( 2,5-dimethoxybenzyl ) -2-phenoxyaniline ( [ ( 18 ) F ] FBR ) , show much great specific signal [ ( 11 ) C ] PK11195 non-human primate . The major objective protocol assess utility [ ( 18 ) F ] FBR PET detect neuroinflammation patient neurocysticercosis . A secondary objective study whether healthy subject show bind [ ( 18 ) F ] FBR perform whole body image use [ 18F ] FBR binding assay use blood cell . In protocol use PET ligand similar structure , [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 , approximately 8 % subject ( 9/~ 118 ) show bind . In protocols 07-N-0035 08-M-0158 , compare bind [ 11C ] PBR28 [ ( 11 ) C ] PK 11195 approximately ten healthy subject include five show binding [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 prior whole body image . We find difference organ regard sensitivity phenomenon non-binding . In non-binders , PBR28 show bind five organ high PBR density . However , PK 11195 show significantly reduce bind two organ PBR . We wish determine whether PBR06 similar PBR28 PK 11195 term non-binding phenomenon . In current protocol , addition whole body image use [ ( 18 ) F ] FBR , vitro binding assay use blood cell another tissue examine effect non-binding . Study population For [ ( 18 ) F ] FBR brain scan , ten patient recruit clinically follow protocol 85-I-0127 , Treatment Cysticercosis include Neurocysticercosis Praziquantel Albendazole ( PI : Theodore E. Nash , MD , NIAID ) . Fifteen healthy subject recruit . For whole body scan use [ ( 18 ) F ] FBR , additional 30 healthy subject recruit . Therefore , total accrual number 10 patient neurocysticercosis 45 healthy subject ( 15 brain [ ( 18 ) F ] FBR 30 whole body [ ( 18 ) F ] FBR scan . Design Ten patient neurocysticercosis 15 age-matched healthy subject brain PET scan . In addition , also perform whole body PET scan 30 healthy subject study radiation-absorbed dos study whether healthy subject show bind [ ( 18 ) F ] FBR . Patients three [ ( 18 ) F ] FBR PET scan follow-up treatment 85-I-0127 , typically week apart . Outcome measure &lt; TAB &gt; In brain PET scan , [ ( 18 ) F ] FBR binding compare clinical symptom MRI finding . In addition , bind compare patient age-matched control subject . We calculate radiation absorb dose approximately seven healthy subject show normal distribution ( i.e. , binder ) activity organ . If find subject appear bind [ ( 18 ) F ] FBR , calculate radiation-absorbed dos non-binders .</detailed_description>
