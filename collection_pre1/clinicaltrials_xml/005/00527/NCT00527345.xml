	<brief_summary>The contribution diesel exhaust ( DE ) health , especially child 's health , tremendous public health interest . DE associate worsen asthma allergy , among important health effect . Reducing DE exposures become major regulatory initiative , federal , state , local jurisdiction invest hundred million dollar retrofit diesel engine school bus change reach goal . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's recent regulation require on-road diesel vehicle change low emission engine ultra-low-sulfur fuel 2007 ( US EPA '00 ) . In spring 2003 , U.S. EPA announce nationwide voluntary school bus retrofit initiative . In July 2003 , Washington Legislature enact statewide `` Diesel Solutions '' program provide 25 million dollar 2008 retrofit school diesel bus clean burn engine fuel , make one large active voluntary school bus retrofit program country . If risk assessment estimate accurate , change large public health impact , especially child ride school bus daily . However , study to-date rigorously examine school child 's exposure diesel exhaust ( DE ) health effect , significant change vehicular pollution control . We propose seize opportunity large natural experiment take place Puget Sound area conduct study assess health effect diesel bus exhaust retrofit diesel bus fleet 2005 2007 . The specific aim study : 1 . Determine whether asthmatic child change retrofit bus clean fuel engine reduction sub-clinical clinical asthma severity . 2 . Determine increased level DE exposure lead increase acute clinical sub-clinical feature asthma child . 3 . Quantify level change particle toxic gas exposures DE 3 group child commute school retrofit bus private car , old diesel bus retrofit later , old diesel bus study . Sub-aim 3 : Use time-activity information , personal exposure measurement , on-bus monitoring data construct exposure model predict individual exposure DE subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We recruit 450 subject range 9 11 year old ( 3rd 5th grader ) . These child commute school perform repeat monthly measure pulmonary function test use spirometry , pulmonary inflammation via exhaled breath , asthma symptom clinical encounter , 3 school year . These 500 child represent 3 exposure scenario : 1 ) one group 125 child rid retrofitted school bus private car ; 2 ) 250 child rid old bus change retrofit bus first second year study ; 3 ) 125 child ride old diesel bus study . All subject either healthy physician-diagnosed asthma severity range mild intermittent moderate persistent . Personal exposure monitor particulate matter , CO , NO2 , SO2 perform subset 144 asthmatic subject , subject monitor 2 day , monitor year . Subjects participate study wear small backpack contain several personal air monitor measure real-time particulate matter concentration carbon monoxide concentration well integrate ( 24 hour average ) measurement SO2 NO2 . The child 's personal monitoring begin wake morning continue 24-hours . When wear backpack inconvenient , sleeping , monitor equipment place close proximity subject . Once subject arrive school , s/he ask perform three respiratory test : exhale nitric oxide , exhale breath condensate , spirometry . At end school day , subject ask perform two test lung function earlier , plus additional test exhale breath condensate . The subject continue his/her day normal . A technician replace filter particulate matter monitor 6 7 PM . We repeat monitoring procedure follow morning subject wake another 24-h . Monitoring stop third morning subject wake . In addition personal monitoring , monitor kit instal subject 's school bus operate technician . This in-vehicle monitoring kit include everything contain personal monitoring kit , plus P-TRAK ( TSI , model 8525 ) real-time ultra-fine particle count , two Harvard Personal Environmental Monitors ( HPEM ) Teflon quartz filter respectively determine elemental carbon fraction , EcoChem PAS2000CE monitor polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAHs ) , global positioning system personal acquisition logger ( GPS-PAL ) . The following timeline show typical daily schedule subject participate study .</detailed_description>
