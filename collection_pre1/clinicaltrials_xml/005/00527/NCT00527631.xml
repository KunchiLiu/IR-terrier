	<detailed_description>The prognosis patient advance epithelial ovarian cancer remain poor despite aggressive surgical resection platinum-based chemotherapy . More 60 % patient develop recurrent disease , principally intraperitoneal , die within 5 year . The use whole abdominal irradiation ( WAI ) consolidation therapy would appear logical strategy , despite whole abdominal irradiation clinically proven efficacy use radiotherapy ovarian cancer profoundly decrease mainly due high treatment-related toxicity . Modern intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) could allow spare kidney , liver , bone marrow still adequately cover peritoneal cavity homogenous dose . The OVAR-IMRT-01 study single center pilot trial phase I/II study . Patients advanced ovarian cancer stage FIGO III ( R1 R2 &lt; 1cm ) surgical resection platinum-based chemotherapy treat whole abdomen irradiation consolidation therapy use intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) total dose 30 Gy 1.5 Gy fraction . A total 8 patient include trial . For treatment plan bone marrow , kidney , liver , spinal cord , vertebral body pelvic bone define organ risk . The planning target volume include entire peritoneal cavity plus pelvic para-aortic node region . The primary endpoint study evaluation feasibility intensity-modulated WAI , secondary endpoint evaluation toxicity intensity modulate WAI continue phase I/II study . The aim explore potential IMRT new method WAI decrease dose kidney , liver , bone marrow cover peritoneal cavity homogenous dose , implement whole abdominal intensity-modulated radiotherapy adjuvant multimodal treatment concept advance ovarian cancer FIGO stage III .</detailed_description>
