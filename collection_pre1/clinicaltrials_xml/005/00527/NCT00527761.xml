	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : 1 . To determine maximum tolerate dose chemotherapy use Taxotere , Temodar , Cisplatin ( TTC ) patient metastatic melanoma . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine toxicity chemotherapy use Taxotere , Temodar , Cisplatin ( TTC ) patient metastatic melanoma 2 .

	<brief_title>Taxotere/Temodar/Cisplatin Study Melanoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Temozolomide , docetaxel , cisplatin `` chemotherapy '' drug , know kill tumor cell interfere important structure cell grow divide . Each drug use separately melanoma treatment . These 3 drug use combination . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test '' . These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete medical history physical exam , include routine blood test ( less 3 tablespoon ) . You electrocardiogram ( EKG - test measure electrical activity heart ) , chest x-ray , CT scan chest abdomen . You MRI CT scan brain well . Depending location melanoma , CT scan head neck pelvis and/or bone scan may take . Photographs tumor may take tumor locate surface skin . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . If find eligible , receive temozolomide , cisplatin , docetaxel . The dos temozolomide cisplatin fix group . The dose docetaxel change patient group high safe dose find Between 3 6 patient enrol group . Docetaxel give vein 1 hour , week , three week ( Days 1 , 8 , 15 ) . This follow one week rest . These 3 week treatment 1 week rest make 1 cycle . Cisplatin give vein day four day row ( Days 1 , 2 , 3 4 ) 2 hour cycle . Temozolomide take mouth five day row ( Days 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 5 ) cycle . The number temozolomide pill take base height weight . Temozolomide must take empty stomach ( least 2 hour meal ) . For comfort receive cisplatin docetaxel vein , doctor may recommend catheter . A catheter plastic tube insert vein one arm vein run underneath collar bone , thread central vein upper part chest . The first dose docetaxel cisplatin dose must give M.D . Anderson outpatient basis . All temozolomide dos take home Day 8 Day 15 dos docetaxel take local clinic . You may receive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) help body produce new blood cell . G-CSF would give injection skin Days 9-13 cycle ( except first cycle ) . During study , complete physical exam every 4 week . Blood sample ( 1 tablespoon less ) take weekly monitor blood count liver function . A chest x-ray CT scan chest abdomen without head neck pelvis do every 2 cycle ( 8 week ) . A MRI CT scan brain well photograph may also take every 2 cycle study . For patient significant tumor shrinkage treatment , image study may repeat 4 week . All participant receive least 6 cycle treatment . If tumor continue shrink end 6 cycle , may eligible receive treatment discretion study chair . You may take study early , disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . You one last `` follow-up '' visit take study . At visit complete physical exam blood sample ( 1 tablespoon ) routine test take . You chest x-ray CT scan chest abdomen , without head neck pelvis , without MRI brain visit well . This investigational study . The FDA approve drug study , commercially available . However , use together study experimental . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol M.D . Anderson .</detailed_description>
