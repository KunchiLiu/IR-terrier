	<brief_summary>Hypoglycemia principal barrier achievement target glycemic goal type 2 diabetes . Alcohol consumption prevalent society proven cause hypoglycemia . Population study suggest elderly , insulin require type 2 diabetes patient particularly vulnerable severe hypoglycemia problem account estimate $ 50 million healthcare cost USA year . We hypothesize low dose ethanol significantly increase vulnerability overnight hypoglycemia impairs recovery plasma glucose elderly , insulin require patient type 2 diabetes . Our preliminary study suggest low dose ethanol impairs recovery day time insulin-induced hypoglycemia type 2 diabetes patient age match healthy control subject . The proposed study examine effect low dose ethanol overnight glucose regulation elderly , insulin require type 2 diabetes patient establish mechanism impairment series systematic evaluation . Specifically , study document suppression dawn phenomenon ethanol , and/or exacerbation deficient counterregulatory response hypoglycemia sleep , especially growth hormone . Specific mechanisms suppression growth hormone examine include even ethanol ( 3 ) inhibits peak overnight ghrelin secretion and/or ( 4 ) reduces pituitary sensitivity GHRH . Additionally , study characterize ( 5 ) dose response characteristic ethanol overnight glucose homeostasis ( 6 ) carefully evaluate effect timing ethanol administration relation meal ingestion overnight hypoglycemic vulnerability . To address aim , assess effect moderate dos orally administer ethanol placebo overnight growth hormone release , ghrelin , total IGF-1 , free IGF-1 , insulin-like growth factor bind protein 1 ( IGFBP-1 ) concentration , glucose production parameter glucose homeostasis among elderly control subject versus elderly , insulin require subject type 2 diabetes . These important study provide scientific basis prevention overnight hypoglycemia ( attendant cost saving ) provide mechanistic insight cause nocturnal hypoglycemia .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All type 2 diabetes subject age 50 75 year carry diagnosis diabetes accord standard criterion receive insulin therapy alone combination oral diabetes medication least 6 month . To exclude subject type 1 diabetes , patient antiGAD antibody negative retain ability secrete nominal level cpeptide response stimulation ( i.e . least 2 ng/ml ingest Boost Plus ) . All subject mentally fit give informed consent . Nondiabetic control subject meet similar inclusion criterion ( except diabetes hemoglobin A1C criterion ) . Control subject match group age , gender BMI . Finally , control subject undergo standard 75 gram Oral Glucose Tolerance Test assure presence normal glucose tolerance ( 142 ) . Exclusion criterion study subject include existence severe cardiovascular , hepatic renal disease , current malignancy determine screening evaluation . Subjects past current history drug alcohol abuse also exclude study , subject previously diagnose seizure disorder , subject sleep apnea medical history demonstrate accommodation sleep study night , subject diabetic gastroparesis , subject receive current treatment medication interfere glucose homeostasis diabetes therapy ( e.g . glucocorticoid , orlistat ) . Because known adverse effect ethanol unborn child , current intrauterine pregnancy exclude patient study . A body mass index great 36 kg/m2 also exclusionary . Additionally , subject score eight point Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ( AUDIT ) exclude study .</criteria>
