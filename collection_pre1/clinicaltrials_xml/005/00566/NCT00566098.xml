	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Activating white blood cell laboratory may help kill cancer cell put back body . This may effective treatment patient undergoing stem cell transplant multiple myeloma . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect activate white blood cell see well work treat patient undergoing stem cell transplant newly diagnose stage II stage III multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Activated White Blood Cells Treating Patients Undergoing Autologous Stem Cell Transplant Newly Diagnosed Stage II Stage III Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate safety response rate activate marrow infiltrate lymphocyte ( aMILs ) patient undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation newly diagnose , stage II-III multiple myeloma . - Determine overall vitro fold-expansion assess pre- post-expansion myeloma T-cell specificity assess feasibility generate aMILs myeloma patient . - Assess toxicity aMILs . - Evaluate effect aMILs hematopoietic engraftment , include neutrophil engraftment , platelet engraftment , primary graft failure ( failure occur ) . - Evaluate response rate utilize Blade criterion , include complete response ( CR ) rate , near complete response ( nCR ) rate , good partial response ( VGPR ) rate , partial response ( PR ) rate , minimal response ( MR ) rate , overall response rate ( CR , VGPR , PR , MR ) . Secondary - Evaluate T-cell reconstitution , include absolute lymphocyte count , CD3+ , CD4+ , CD8+ T-cell count . - Evaluate progression-free survival overall survival . - Evaluate anti-tumor immune response . - Determine pneumococcal-specific vaccine response . - Determine delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) responses . OUTLINE : Patients undergo collection marrow infiltrate lymphocyte ( MILs ) * either diagnosis prior initiation induction therapy upon completion induction therapy . The MILs bone marrow product undergo ex vivo activation expansion T cell 7-8 day produce activated marrow infiltrate lymphocyte ( aMILs ) . Patients undergo stem cell mobilization leukapheresis collect peripheral blood stem cell 12 day mobilization . Patients receive melphalan IV 20-30 minute day -2 -1 undergo peripheral blood stem cell transplantation day 0 plan . Patients receive aMILs infusion day 3 . Patients receive pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine day 21 . NOTE : *Patients complete induction therapy receive pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine approximately 2 week prior MILs collection ; patient undergo MILs collection prior start induction therapy receive pre-transplantation vaccine . Blood bone marrow sample collect periodically laboratory correlative study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 1 year .</detailed_description>
