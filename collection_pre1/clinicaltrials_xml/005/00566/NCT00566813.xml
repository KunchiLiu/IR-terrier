	<brief_title>Islet Transplantation Type 1 Diabetic Patients Using Edmonton Protocol Steroid Free Immunosuppression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus become unbearable burden health care system worldwide . The incidence disease increase past 50 year , type I type II diabetes . In 2002 , expenditure direct indirect cost diabetes reach astronomical amount $ 132 billion USA alone . The burden suffer patient also grave consider diabetic neuropathy retinopathy lead cause renal failure blindness industrialized country . Although major improvement insulin treatment glycemic control achieve , development hypoglycemic unawareness still represent challenge clinical problem management diabetes . Severe hypoglycemic episode acutely life threaten lead overall impairment quality life diabetic patient . Even ideal study condition pathophysiology hypoglycemic unawareness fully understood . It seem hypoglycemic episode reduces counterregulatory hormone response subjective awareness follow episode , generate self-worsening mechanism . Islet transplantation effectively eliminate severe hypoglycemia restore good glycemic control . However , still several limitation widespread application islet transplantation . First , insulin independence mostly achieve transplant high number islet harvest 2-4 donor . Second , post-transplant insulin-independence progressively lose time despite continued endogenous insulin secretion . Lastly , current immunosuppression carry potential risk incompletely prevent sensitization host rejection . At present , clinical trial islet transplantation face stringent federal regulation , define islet biological drug islet transplantation experimental procedure . Limited resource impose small uncontrolled trial investigate limited number new intervention improve outcomes . This study Phase 1/2 single center , uncontrolled trial 1-3 allogeneic pancreatic islet transplant perform study subject . Post-transplant follow-up continue 64 week final islet transplantation . Thereafter , subject enrolled 5-year follow-up study . The safety islet transplantation depend primarily incidence serious unexpected complication adverse event ability cell isolation laboratory produce uncontaminated islet cell preparation minimal endotoxin content . All study subject follow safety one year . An independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) , compose 3 member train medicine and/or organ transplantation , review eligibility safety data approximately 2 week islet transplantation every two month thereafter . An independent monitor knowledge Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) guideline regulation monitor study compliance 21 CFR accord ICH GCP Guidelines . Within Clinical Research Center , Scientific Advisory Committee Research Subject Advocacy Program monitor safety . These entity report Institutional Review Board , also review safety data annually occurrence serious adverse event . The principal investigator also report serious adverse event US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Success : Islet transplantation consider success subject use insulin achieve fast glucose level exceed 140 mg/dL three time week , exceed two-hour post-prandial value 180 mg/dL four time week . Partial Success : Subjects reduction insulin requirement achieve insulin independence present reduction HbA1c number hypoglycemic episode consider partial success islet transplantation . Reduction insulin-requirements assess compare pre-transplant insulin requirement record two consecutive day ( expressed insulin unit per kg ) requirement two consecutive day precede subsequent islet infusion , requirement two consecutive day six month two consecutive day one year final transplant . Failure : Absence measurable level C-peptide transplantation consider failure islet cell transplantation .</detailed_description>
