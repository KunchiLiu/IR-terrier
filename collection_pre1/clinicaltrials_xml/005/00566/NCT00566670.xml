	<brief_summary>National Kidney Foundation guideline recommend dietary protein intake 1.2 gram per kilogram per day ( g/kg/d ) hemodialysis patient . However , unclear whether consumption high amount protein dialysis patient beneficial harmful nutritional cardiovascular effect population . High protein intake might improve nutritional status , argue state low muscle mass , small body size low serum protein level result decrease dietary intake , rather result hypercatabolism induce metabolic acidosis , inflammation oxidative stress . The specific aim study examine prospective cohort hemodialysis patient longitudinal association absolute total protein intake dietary protein intake muscle mass arterial stiffness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It hypothesize dialysis population overall : ( 1 ) Protein intake major determinant muscle mass inflammation , oxidative stress metabolic acidosis play less role ; ( 2 ) Malnutrition uremic cardiovascular risk factor hence low protein intake cause cardiovascular disease ; ( 3 ) In extreme , high protein intake also major cause cardiovascular disease since high serum phosphorus associate high protein intake usually control use phosphorus binder routine clinical practice . The specific aim proposal examine prospective cohort hemodialysis patient longitudinal association absolute total protein intake ( TPI ) grams/day , dietary protein intake ( DPI ) normalize body weight grams/kilogram/day ) 1 . Nutritional status ( mid-thigh muscle mass measure Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) functional status ( 6-min walk ) 2 . Arterial stiffness ( aortic pulse wave velocity ) Understanding relationship protein intake body composition ( muscle mass ) intermediate cardiovascular outcome ( arterial stiffness ) stage 5 CKD patient hemodialysis great scientific practical significance</detailed_description>
