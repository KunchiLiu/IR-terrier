	<brief_summary>Persistent human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection single necessary cause cervical cancer . Cervical cancer still major health problem develop country . It first rank woman 's cancer Thailand many decade . Approximately 10-20 % Thai woman high-risk HPV ( HR-HPV ) infection cervix . This frequently lead low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( LSILs ) ( 10 % ) , high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( HSILs ) ( 0.8 % ) , finally , cervical cancer ( 0.16 % ) within 10-20 year . The treatment option LSILs either observation ablative surgery . However , institute , cryotherapy , one ablative surgery , frequently use comfort woman . It effective safe minimal side effect ; watery leukorrhea 2-4 week , local cervical infection 1 % . Contraindication procedure active cervical infection , lesion 2 mm-larger probe , lesion inside cervical o suspect cervical cancer . Additionally , develop country Thailand , treatment safe , acceptable , feasible effective . Patients LSILs could also treatment rural area 10-days trained nurse . Fortunately , recent report show cryotherapy ability clear LSILs also clear HPV infection , necessary cause . However , randomize control trial compare clearing ability observation cryotherapy . Therefore , randomize control trial need demonstrate . Findings trial contribute enormously old woman already get infected HPV . Aside prevent cervical cancer treat woman , cryotherapy could also give relief worry time-bomb like HPV infection cervix .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cryotherapy Human Papillomavirus Clearance Biopsy-confirmed Cervical Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This hospital-based , parallel , assessor-blinded , randomize control trial . Study subject refer LSIL patient , 30 years-old , positive HPV test contraindication perform cryotherapy . Therefore , recruitment LSIL patient whose age 30 years-old , exclude negative HPV test contraindication perform cryotherapy . The primary outcome HPV clearance ( negative HPV test baseline HPV type ) 12 month treatment . Subjects randomly allocate treated cryotherapy observation use block randomization vary block size 2 , 4 , 6 . The sample size least 25 arm plan power 80 % detect 20 % difference rate HPV clearance 12 month treatment two arm , significance level 0.05 , two-sided test . Study population : Biopsy-confirmed LSIL patient , age 30 years-old , refer either Srinagarind Hospital 's , Khon Kaen Hospital 's , Roi Et Hospital 's colposcopic clinic . Inclusion criterion : - Baseline HPV test positive . - Be able give inform consent study . Exclusion criterion : - Having active cervical infection - Having lesion 2 mm-larger probe - Having lesion inside cervical o - Having suspect cervical cancer lesion Sample sample size : From previous study , HPV clearance rate cryotherapy 12 month 83.9 % . ( Elfgren , 2002 ) Spontaneous HPV clearance rate young woman 24 month 70 % . ( Moscicki , 1998 ) However , HPV clearance rate woman older 34 years-old 12 month 53.6 % . ( Clavel , 2005 ) Using number respectively PE PC put formula , calculate sample size group . The sample size calculate detect 20-40 % difference HPV clearance rate 12 month , significant level 95 % power 80 % ( two-sided test ) , use approach Lachin review paper Donner . ( Donner , 1984 ) Required sample size different rate clearance P-control P-experimental Alpha level Power N Difference 95 % CI 0.50 0.70 5 % 80 % 103 20 6.9-33.1 0.50 0.75 5 % 80 % 66 25 9-41 0.50 0.80 5 % 80 % 45 30 11.3-48.7 0.50 0.85 5 % 80 % 33 35 14-56 0.50 0.90 5 % 80 % 25 40 17.1-62.9 The sample size least 25 patient group choose precision feasibility . Such sample size detect 40 % difference HPV clearance rate two group , 95 % significant level , power 80 % , 95 % CI 17.1-62.9 , respectively . Instruments : After sign consent form , eligible patient examine baseline standard procedure PCR-HPV test 37 HPV type . Only positive HPV test one enrol trial randomize receive cryotherapy observation . The method block randomization , block size varies 2 6 , use allocate treatment . The allocation ratio 1:1 . The allocation sequence generate computer , use STATA software version 10.0 . Based obtained schedule , number seal envelope , equal require block , prepare label . Each envelope contain correspond seal allocation card allocate treatment patient . Colposcopy cryotherapy instrument available colposcopic clinic . However , reimburse CO2-gases tank material use Pap smear HPV test . The people , prepare randomized scheme , involve trial . The allocation schedule conceal assessor ( measure HPV testing ) end trial . Data collection measurement : Because difference two treatment , assessor ( measure HPV testing ) blind treatment . The specimens sent assessor without patient 's name HN link treatment receive . They provide study ID number principle investigator link treatment receive . The main outcome HPV clearance . It measure gold-standard HPV testing . This perform baseline 12 month later . Data analysis : There two main part analysis - describing select characteristic study patient analysis answer research question . The first part , select baseline characteristic patient treatment compare i.e . age , sex , sexual experience , underlie disease , etc . Comparability distribution select characteristic base judgment rather statistical significant test . In part , proportion use summarize categorical data . For continuous data , statistic include mean , standard deviation , minimum , maximum , median . For second part , analysis base group study patient randomize ( intention-to-treat basis ) . The different rate clearance two arm trial 95 % confidence interval calculate . This do 12 month treatment . Z-test use test difference different zero . Multiple logistic regression use control effect important confound factor . Absolute risk reduction ( ARR ) , relative risk reduction ( RRR ) number need treat ( NNT ) also calculate . The statistical analysis clinical trial perform base intention-to-treat principle . All hypothesis test two-tailed significant level 0.05 . Statistical package analysis STATA version 10.0 .</detailed_description>
