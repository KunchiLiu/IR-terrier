	<brief_summary>· What know : Hydrosalpinx IVF About 40 % patient undergoing IVF tubal disease 25 % -30 % tubal disease patient fluid collection within tube ; hydrosalpinx . The amount fluid hydrosalpinx know increase ovarian stimulation ( IVF ) often empty uterine cavity . Fluid hydrosalpinges find detrimental growth development mouse embryo vitro , associate reduced level endometrial integrins vivo . This could explanation reduced pregnancy rate IVF patient tubal disease hydrosalpinx compare tubal disease hydrosalpinx . This effect evidence fresh frozen embryo transfer cycle . Also significant increase miscarriage association hydrosalpinx . The study aim answer question : ultrasound-guided aspiration ultrasound diagnose hydrosalpinx time egg collection improve pregnancy rate IVF ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound-guided Hydrosalpinx Aspiration During Egg Collection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>· What know : Treatment hydrosalpinx IVF Several study literature suggest treatment hydrosalpinx pre-IVF would improve pregnancy rate level similar tubal disease patient without hydrosalpinx . The treatment modality explore salpingectomy , salpingostomy , tubal occlusion ultrasound-guided aspiration either one month time egg collection . All study report date retrospective poor control design . A prospective randomise control trial need . All modality associate similar improvement pregnancy rate , least invasive modality ultrasound-guided aspiration time oocyte collection . We propose conduct prospective randomise control trial evaluate effect ultrasound-guided aspiration ( versus aspiration ) hydrosalpinx time egg collection pregnancy rate IVF .</detailed_description>
