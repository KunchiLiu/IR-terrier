	<detailed_description>The adrenergic neurotransmission serve multiple function include learning , emotional processing stress response psychological physical challenge ( Huether , 1996 ; Sved et al. , 2001 ) . Adrenergic transmission also mediate drug withdrawal state stress-induced relapse drug use ( Aston-Jones et al. , 2004 ; Stewart , 2000 ) . Consistent preclinical finding , adrenergic blocker show promise treatment cocaine dependence ( Kampman et al. , 2001b ; Kampman et al. , 2006 ) . These preliminary finding significant proven pharmacotherapies cocaine addiction although estimate 2.3 million Americans age 12 old regular cocaine user ( SAMHSA , 2004 ) . The societal cost cocaine addiction estimate $ 45 billion US , suggest development even modestly effective cocaine pharmacotherapies great economic benefit . For example , availability medication decrease cocaine use 10 percent estimate $ 745 million economic benefit US alone ( Cartwright , 2000 ) . Thus , develop effective treatment cocaine addiction essential goal significant benefit society individual .</detailed_description>
