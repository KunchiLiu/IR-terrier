	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Adjunctive Zonisamide Paediatric Partial Onset Seizures ( CATZ Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind , randomise , study compare zonisamide placebo : arm consist 102 subject . Zonisamide/placebo dose commence dose 1 mg/kg . Further dose increase occur weekly interval dose 8 mg/kg reach end Week 8 . In event dose limit adverse event ( AEs ) , eight week Titration Period , one titration low dose permit , happen point Titration Period . Subjects require titration step withdrawn study . During Maintenance Period dose study medication must remain unchanged . Changes concomitant AEDs permit Screening , Titration Maintenance Periods . This trial consist follow period : 1 . Screening Period ( duration four week ) : Screening Visit perform , seizure diary maintain document baseline seizure frequency eight week Screening Visit Randomisation Visit . 2 . Titration Period ( duration four week ) : period , zonisamide/placebo dose commence dose 1 mg/kg . Further dose increase occur one week interval dose 8 mg/kg reach Visit 6 ( Week 8 ) . In event dose limit AEs Titration Period , one titration step previous dose permit . 3 . Maintenance Period ( duration 12 week ) : period , randomised subject treat dose zonisamide/placebo receive Visit 6 ( Week 8 ) . No change dose allow phase . Following Maintenance Period subject opportunity enter open label extension study . This open label extension study subject separate protocol discuss time .</detailed_description>
