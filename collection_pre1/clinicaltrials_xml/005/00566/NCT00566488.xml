	<brief_summary>This study three primary purpose : ass parathyroid function parathyroid transplantation infant Complete DiGeorge syndrome ; ass immune function development transplantation ; , ass safety tolerability procedure . This Phase 1 , single site , open , non-randomized clinical protocol . Enrollment close study intervention complete enrolled subject ; subject continue observation follow-up . Subjects 2 year old complete DiGeorge syndrome ( atypical typical ) receive thymus transplantation . Subjects receive pre-transplant immune suppression rabbit anti-human-thymocyte-globulin . Subjects hypoparathyroidism eligible parental donor receive thymus parental parathyroid transplantation . A primary hypothesis : Thymus/Parathyroid transplant subject need less calcium and/or calcitriol supplementation 1 year post-transplant compare historical control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Parathyroid Thymus Transplantation DiGeorge # 931</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed : DiGeorge Syndrome complex three problem , 1 ) cardiac defect , 2 ) parathyroid deficiency , 3 ) absence thymus , result profound T-cell deficiency . There spectrum disease DiGeorge syndrome respect three defect . There safe effective treatment DiGeorge Syndrome patient die age two . For patient severe T cell defect , PI show thymus transplantation safe efficacious clinical protocol . Research subject complete typical atypical DiGeorge syndrome eligible study . Subjects athymia profound hypoparathyroidism eligible parental parathyroid transplantation protocol . DiGeorge syndrome infant , successful thymus transplant hypoparathyroidism , must go clinic frequent calcium level hospital calcium infusion ; infant hypoparathyroidism risk seizure low calcium . Approximately ½ infant profound hypoparathyroidism develop nephrocalcinosis . Depending T cell phenotype function , subject give one two different immunosuppression regimen . Typical complete DiGeorge subject ( proliferative T cell function &lt; 50,000 cpm ) receive Thymoglobulin pre-transplantation . Typical complete DiGeorge subject ( proliferative cell response PHA &gt; 50,000 cpm ) atypical DiGeorge subject ( proliferative T cell response PHA &lt; 75,000 cpm ) receive Thymoglobulin ( pre-transplantation ) cyclosporine ( pre-transplantation post-transplantation ) . Thymoglobulin use part prevent graft rejection also deplete T cell donor parathyroid . Cyclosporine use deplete activated T cell recipient . For subject , acetaminophen , diphenhydramine , methylprednisolone give concurrently rabbit anti-human thymocyte globulin . The thymus culture standard medium 10-21 day deplete mature thymocytes could cause GVHD . In operating room , thymus tissue place quadriceps muscle one leg . The parathyroid donation preferably do time thymus transplantation . Parathyroid tissue place quadriceps muscle one leg , use incision thymus transplantation . Depending post-transplant immune status , subject may receive cyclosporine steroid . For 3 month thymus transplantation , T cell monitor flow cytometry approximately every 2-4 week . Alternatively , absolute lymphocyte count use maximum possible T cell number . At 2-3 month post-transplant , subject thymus allograft biopsy , do general anesthesia operating room . The biopsy approximately 4 pea-sized ( 3x3mm ) portion muscle tissue thymus transplant insert . Using immunohistochemistry , biopsy determine thymopoiesis graft rejection . The parathyroid biopsied small ; biopsy could remove parathyroid tissue . A research skin biopsy ( site skin incision time transplantation ) do determine whether T cell present pre-transplantation . A skin biopsy also do time thymus graft biopsy look clonal T cell population . For subject develop T cell , post-transplantation pneumocystis prophylaxis use approximately 1 year IV immunoglobulin approximately 2 year .</detailed_description>

Typical subject must rash T cell biopsy lymphadenopathy . Atypical subject rash T cell biopsy ; may lymphadenopathy . PHA proliferative response must test 2x • Atypical : PHA response must &lt; 75,000cpm 2 test ; test do immunosuppression . Additional Criteria Parathyroid Treatment Inclusion Hypoparathyroidism At least 1 parent must agree parathyroid donor Must require calcium supplementation maintain ionized calcium &gt; 1.0 mmol/L . Alternatively , intact PTH must &lt; low limit normal ionized calcium &lt; 1.2 mmol/L . ( Intact PTH measure 2x pretreatment . ) DiGeorge Treatment Exclusion : Heart surgery conduct &lt; 4 week pretreatment Heart surgery anticipate w/in 3 month treatment Rejection surgeon anesthesiologist surgical candidate Lack sufficient muscle tissue accept 0.2gms/kg treatment Prior attempt immune reconstitution , bone marrow treatment previous thymus treatment Does n't commit remain Duke thymus allograft biopsy Parathyroid Donor Inclusion : Serum calcium normal range Normal parathyroid hormone function HLA typing must consistent parentage . Must anticoagulation come Parent choose donation 1 share HLA allele thymus donor HLADR matching prefer HLA class I match . If HLA matching , either parent acceptable meet criteria . Negative EBV ; CMV ; HIV1 ; Syphilis ; West Nile virus ; Hepatitis B ; Hepatitis C ; pregnancy ; &amp; evidence head/neck infection Fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy show vocal cord function normally . Normal thyroid function No history cancer The infantrecipient 2 living involve parent . Parathyroid Donor Exclusion : Infant recipient n't 2 live involve parent Animal tissue/organ recipient EBV CMV HIV1 Syphilis West Nile virus Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Pregnant Evidence head/neck infection Vocal cord function normally . Thyroid abnormalities Hyperparathyroidism History cancer Mad cow disease ( positive ) SARS ( exposure ) Smallpox exposure Biological Mother DiGeorge Subjects Inclusions : Mother must competent consent assent study participation willing provide blood sample .
