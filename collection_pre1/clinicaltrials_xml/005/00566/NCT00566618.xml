	<brief_title>Dasatinib Combination With Zoledronic Acid Treatment Breast Cancer With Bone Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Zoledronic acid design strengthen bone prevent fracture break bone . Dasatinib design block ( stop ) cell responsible breakdown bone . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , enrol group least 3 participant begin receive zoledronic acid dasatinib . The dose dasatinib receive depend enrol study . All participant receive amount zoledronic acid . The first group participant treat low dose dasatinib give combination zoledronic acid . Once high tolerable dose level find , 25 additional participant enrol dose level . This call Phase II portion study . Drug Administration : You receive zoledronic acid needle vein Day 1 15 minute . You take dasatinib mouth daily 28 day . Dasatinib take empty stomach light meal . Every 28 day call study `` cycle . '' Study Visits Participants Phase I Portion : On Day 1 Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ECG . On Day 8 Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ECG . On Day 15 Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform . - You physical exam . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ECG . On Day 21 Cycle 1 , follow test procedure perform . - Your vital sign measure . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ECG . On Day 1 Cycle 2 , ECG . On Day 1 cycle , follow test procedure perform . - You physical exam . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You MRIs , CT scan , and/or x-rays check status disease . On Days 1 28 Cycle 1 every 3rd month , urine collect 24 hour check marker bone loss . After Cycles 3 , 6 , 9 , CT scan , MRIs , and/or x-ray check status disease At study visit , ask drug may take side effect may experience . Study Visits Participants Phase II Portion : On Day 1 cycle , follow test procedure perform . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You performance status evaluation . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Days 1 28 Cycle 1 every 3rd month , urine collect check marker bone loss . After Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , CT scan , MRIs , and/or x-ray check status disease . At study visit , ask drug may take side effect may experience . Length Study : You may remain study long benefitting . You take study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . End-of-Study Visit : Once go off-study , end-of-study visit . - Your vital sign measure . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You MRIs , CT scan , and/or x-rays check status disease . This investigational study . Zoledronic acid FDA approve commercially available treatment breast cancer . Dasatinib FDA approve commercially available treatment breast cancer . It authorize use research . Up 28 patient take part multicenter study . Up 12 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

The use oral antibiotic prophylaxis allow . 13 . Patients must baseline ECG QTc within normal range within 28 day prior registration . 14 . Patients must inform investigational nature study must sign give write informed consent . 15 . Patients may receive previous radiation must complete radiation least 2 week ( 8 week radiation brain ) prior registration . Patients irradiated tumor site evaluable disease eligible protocol therapy unless documented disease progression within previously radiate site . 16 . Patients must recover grade &lt; /= 1 acute toxicity previous radiation hormonal therapy . 17 .
