	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy together radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving treatment surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give cisplatin paclitaxel together radiation therapy surgery work treat patient advanced cancer oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph 2 Intensification Regimen Previously Untreated , Resectable , Advanced Squamous Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine feasibility new intensification regimen comprise cisplatin paclitaxel combination radiotherapy surgery patient resectable advanced squamous cell carcinoma oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx . Secondary - Assess disease-free interval failure sit patient treated regimen . - Correlate molecular marker treatment outcome patient . - Correlate quality life treatment outcome patient . - Determine frequency severity toxicity regimen patient . - Evaluate treatment completion patient . OUTLINE : - Preoperative therapy ( week 1 2 ) : Patients receive cisplatin IV 2 hour day 1-3 . Patients also undergo intensity-modulated external beam radiotherapy daily day 1-5 8-12 . - Surgery ( week 3 ) : Patients undergo surgical resection primary tumor ( without neck dissection ) intraoperative boost radiotherapy . - Postoperative therapy ( week 7-10 ) : Patients receive cisplatin IV 2 hour day 1-3 22-24 paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Patients also undergo intensity-modulated external beam radiotherapy day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 . Patients undergo blood tissue sample collection baseline , week 3 , 7-10 , 14 , periodically thereafter biomarker correlative study . Quality life assess baseline , 3 , 6 , 12 month completion treatment , annually thereafter . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month 1 year periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
