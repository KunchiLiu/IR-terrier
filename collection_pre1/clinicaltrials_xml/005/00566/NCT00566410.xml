	<brief_summary>Dichloroacetate ( DCA ) small molecule use year treat lactic acidosis rare metabolic disorder human . Further test show may suppress growth human cancer cell . Tests DCA human cell culture outside body find kill lung , breast , brain cancer cell , without affect human normal cell . Tumors rat infected human tumor also shrink considerably . Most cancer characterize resistance apoptosis ( cell death remove abnormal cell ) make likely grow well resistant cancer treatment . Plus , many current cancer treatment kill cancerous healthy cell highly toxic . DCA work reverse damage mitochondrion present cancer cell , thus reactivate apoptosis ( cell death ) mechanism . The result death cancer cell . This mitochondrial reactivation present entirely new approach treat cancer . DCA know relatively well tolerated significant side effect selectivity , effectiveness ease delivery ( oral ) make attractive opportunity . It hop one day treatment may become safe effective treatment , either along conjunction treatment , many form cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As cancer cell hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane deficiency Kv channel expression , postulate reversal observation may increase apoptosis inhibit tumor growth . Bonnet colleague report administration DCA lead switch glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation Krebs Cycle inhibition PDHK . This associated increase production reactive oxygen specie decrease hyperpolarization inner mitochondrial membrane , lead efflux proapoptotic protein apoptosis measure increased TUNEL-positive cell . In addition , DCA also decrease expression survivin , anti-apoptotic protein . DCA upregulated expression Kv channel cancer cell , lead efflux potassium ion increase proapoptotic effect DCA . Such change energy metabolism apoptosis observe normal cell . DCA also show inhibit tumor growth vitro vivo . Thus , inhibition PDHK DCA represent novel anti-cancer therapy target reasonable toxicity normal tissue . It therefore interest study DCA refractory cancer patient . Although bioavailability 50-60 % normal subject treat 2.5 microgram/kg DCA , study use clinically relevant dose DCA 50 mg/kg , bioavailability 100 % health volunteer . DCA administer 50 mg/kg/day achieve plasma concentration require inhibition PHDK , target enzyme least 24 hour , without exceed concentration maximal lactate lowering . There high incidence peripheral neuropathy adult MELAS administration DCA 50 mg/kg/day 6 month , peripheral neuropathy part MELAS syndrome , many adult patient MELAS develop diabetes mellitus , commonly present peripheral neuropathy . In contrary , peripheral neuropathy observe child congenital acidosis prolong treatment DCA 50 mg/kg/day 2 year . Therefore , exclusion patient grade 2 high peripheral neuropathy careful monitoring peripheral neuropathy use monofilaments , likelihood develop severe peripheral neuropathy adult cancer patient minimize . Given presence significant neuropathy adult patient MELAS treatment DCA 25 mg/kg/day , judge safe reasonable establish start dose 12.5 mg/kg/day adult cancer patient .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm recurrent metastatic solid tumour . All patient meaningful therapy available include hormone therapy , chemotherapy target therapy . For malignancy proven therapy , enrol without prior systemic therapy . 2 . Four week must elapse since prior chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , target therapy , radiation therapy . There restriction amount bone marrow previously radiate . 3 . Recovery baseline , , grade 1 drugrelated toxicity due prior chemotherapy , radiation , hormonal therapy , molecular target therapy , except alopecia . 4 . Age ≥ 18 year . 5 . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky ≥70 % , see Appendix A ) . 6 . Life expectancy great 12 week . 7 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL hemoglobin ≥90 g/L platelet ≥100,000/mcL total bilirubin ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 X ULN ≤ 5 X ULN presence liver metastases creatinine ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit normal 8 . Cardiac ejection fraction MUGA scan echocardiogram must &gt; 50 % patient baseline . 9 . The effect DCA develop human fetus unknown . For reason DCA teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( e.g . : hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 10 . Ability understand purpose study willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , molecular target therapy , radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 2 . Patients may receive investigational agent , chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy , molecular target agent . 3 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction could confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . 4 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition DCA . 5 . Due possibility peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy DCA , presence grade 2 high peripheral neuropathy due prior medical condition ( multiple sclerosis ) , medication , etiology . 6 . Any psychological , familial , sociological , geographical condition permit medical followup compliance study protocol . 7 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Specifically , patient take either oral hypoglycemics insulin diabetes mellitus eligible DCA combination agent may increase risk clinically significant hypoglycemia , compromise patient safety . 8 . Pregnant woman exclude study DCA agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother DCA , breastfeed discontinue mother treated DCA . 9 . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction DCA . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . 10 . 5 year must elapse since initial curative procedure malignancy , except situ cervical cancer , basal cell carcinoma skin , localized prostate cancer curative therapy surgery , radiation . 11 . History malabsorption syndrome substantial amount small bowel stomach remove may impair absorption DCA . 12 . Patients take warfarin . Low dose therapeutic dose heparin low molecular weight heparin allow .</criteria>
