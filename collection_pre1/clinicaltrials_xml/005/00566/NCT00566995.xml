	<brief_summary>This study examine effectiveness investigational drug call ZD6474 ( also know vandetanib ZACTIMA ) . Vandetanib experimental drug design prevent growth development new blood vessel tumor prevent direct growth cancer cell . It test number clinical trial adult cancer , United States ( U.S. ) Food Drug Administration specifically approve cancer treatment . The purpose investigational study well understand vandetanib affect human kidney cancer relate von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) disease , develop test may improve researcher understand kidney cancer effect . Volunteers must least 18 year old must diagnose kidney cancer relate VHL . Candidates must life expectancy great three month must least one measurable renal tumor study purpose . Candidates may receive investigational agent treat investigational drug within past four week . Candidates surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy within past four week exclude study . Candidates screen physical examination medical history . During study , participant receive oral dose vandetanib day 28 day ( treatment period know cycle ) . Participants need return National Institutes Health every two week day week first dose vandetanib series test procedure , include blood urine test electrocardiogram . Every 12 week , computerize tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan do assess size participant tumor . Participants whose tumor grow unacceptable side effect may continue receive vandetanib maintain current condition , researcher conclude study ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Vandetanib Individuals With Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Von Hippel Lindau disease hereditary cancer syndrome affect individual risk develop tumor number organ , include kidney , brain , spine , adrenal gland , eye pancreas . The molecular hallmark VHL inactivation VHL gene lead accumulation protein target degradation ubiquitin pathway , include group transcriptionally active protein call hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) , whose alpha subunit undergo degradation VHL-dependent fashion . Accumulation HIFs result overexpression several gene include vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , glucose transporter 1 ( GLUT-1 ) , transform growth factor ( TGF ) -alpha , platelet- derive growth factor ( PDGF ) , erythropoietin , believe play role tumorigenesis , tumor progression metastasis . ZD6474 orally administer receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor activity Kinase insert domain-containing receptor/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( KDR/VEGFR2 ) epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . Kinase insert domain receptor ( KDR ) /vascular growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) endothelial cell receptor vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) play crucial role mediate tumor angiogenesis , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ( receptor TGF-alpha epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) believe mediate tumor growth proliferation . Objective : Primary Objective To assess overall response rate VHL patient renal tumor treat single agent ZD6474 Secondary Objectives : To study safety tolerability ZD6474 To evaluate time progression progression-free survival VHL patient receive ZD6474 To study effect ZD6474 treatment non-renal tumor associate von Hippel Lindau disease ( pancreatic tumor , pheochromocytoma , central nervous system ( CNS ) hemangioblastomas ) To investigate effect ZD6474 circulate endothelial cell endothelial progenitor cell explore utility marker surrogates angiogenesis inhibition To investigate effect ZD6474 biomarkers angiogenesis plasma VEGF soluble VEGFR2 Eligibility : Adults clinical diagnosis von Hippel Lindau disease Presence one measurable renal tumor Age great equal 18 year Adequate organ function , performance status ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0-2 ) life expectancy ( great 3 month ) Design : Single agent ZD6474 administer daily start dose 300mg per day Patients evaluate response every 12 week use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria The study base open label two-stage optimal phase II design Accrual maximum 37 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must satisfy follow criterion eligible study enrolment . Clinical diagnosis von Hippel Lindau disease . The presence least one measurable ( defined RECIST ) renal tumor ( renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) ) . Patients tumor localize kidney well metastatic RCC eligible . Age great equal 18 year . Life expectancy great 3 month Performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 02 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : white blood cell ( WBC ) count great equal 3,000micro/L , absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500 micro/L platelet count great equal 100,000 micro/L , serum creatinine less equal 1.5 time upper limit reference range measure 24 hr . creatinine clearance great equal 50 ml/min , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) less 2.5 time upper limit reference range , total bilirubin le 1.5 time upper limit reference range ( less 3 time upper limit reference range patient Gilberts disease ) , alkaline phosphatase less equal 2.5 time upper limit reference range ( less equal 5 time upper limit reference range consider related liver metastasis principal investigator ( PI ) ) . No history serious intercurrent medical illness . At least four week completion surgical investigational therapy von Hippel Lindau least 4 week major surgical procedure . In addition , patient undergo recent major surgery well heal surgical incision . All men woman childbearing potential must use effective contraception . Negative pregnancy test female patient childbearing potential within 7 day prior enrolment study Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Prior concomitant nonvon Hippel Lindau associate malignancy exception adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , cervical carcinoma situ malignancy patient remain disease free five year . Known brain metastasis ( unless adequately resect irradiated evidence recurrence least 6 month ) . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event ( less equal grade 1 Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v3.0 ) due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent receive treatment nonapproved investigational drug within 4 week prior Day 1 study treatment except use imaging study . Use 5HT3 antagonist potential effect correct QT interval ( QTc ) interval . Any concurrent medication may cause QTc prolongation induce Torsades de Pointes . Concomitant medication potent inducer cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) function , rifampin , rifabutin , phenytoin , carbamazepine , barbiturates phenobarbital , St. Johns Wort . Clinically significant cardiac event ( include symptomatic heart failure , myocardial infarction angina ) within 3 month entry presence cardiac disease opinion Principal Investigator increase risk ventricular arrhythmia . History clinically significant arrhythmia [ include multifocal premature ventricular contraction ( PVC ) , bigeminy , trigeminy , ventricular tachycardia ] symptomatic require treatment ( CTCAE grade 3 ) asymptomatic sustain ventricular tachycardia Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation . Atrial fibrillation control medication exclude . Presence Left bundle branch block . Previous history QTc prolongation take medication require discontinuation medication . Congenital long QT syndrome first degree relative unexplained sudden death age 40 year QTc Bazetts correction unmeasurable , great equal 480 msec screen electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . If patient QTc great equal 480 msec screen ECG , screen ECG may repeat twice ( least 24 hour apart ) . The average QTc three screen ECGs must less 480 msec order patient eligible study ) . Patients receive drug risk QTc prolongation exclude QTc great equal 460 msec .
