	<brief_summary>Molecular Breast Imaging highly promise novel methodology breast cancer detection . Preliminary patient study dual-detector system indicate system capable reliably detect small ( 5-10 mm ) malignant lesion breast . Besides usefulness Molecular Breast Imaging tumor detection , speculate tumor uptake washout may predictors response neoadjuvant therapy patient diagnosis breast cancer . We propose patient breast cancer undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy neoadjuvant hormone therapy molecular breast image accurate test assess response rate neoadjuvant therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adjuvant therapy surgery breast cancer provide significant benefit patient risk relapse . However , success therapy individual patient often take year reveal . Preoperative ( neoadjuvant ) medical therapy potent initial treatment inoperable large operable breast cancer . Tumor regression achieve great majority patient downstaging frequently reduces need mastectomy become clear pathologic complete response good prognostic marker . Data current trial suggest survival least good preoperative postoperative neoadjuvant therapy ( 1 ) . With observation preoperative medical therapy advantage post-operative neoadjuvant therapy use short term surrogate marker long-term outcome . With translational approach , therapy patient target individualized lead high success rate ; , new therapy early breast cancer assess much quickly currently possible protract trial neoadjuvant therapy ( 2 ) . This approach therefore increasingly utilized patient low stage breast cancer .</detailed_description>
