	<brief_title>Open Label Study Adalimumab Subjects Who Have Sub-optimal Response Systemic Therapy Phototherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 16-week multicenter , open-label study design evaluate efficacy safety load dose 80 mg adalimumab , follow 40 mg adalimumab every week treatment psoriasis patient sub-optimal response etanercept , methotrexate ( MTX ) , Narrow band Ultraviolet âˆ’ B ( NB-UVB ) . Approximately 150 participant plan 3 sub-studies : 80 participant sub-optimal response etanercept , 40 participant sub-optimal response MTX , 30 participant sub-optimal response NB-UVB . Actual enrollment 82 participant sub-optimal response etanercept , 41 participant sub-optimal response MTX , 29 participant sub-optimal response NB-UVB . Screening perform least 96 hour 31 day Baseline visit ( Week 0 ) . A participant eligible study base sub-optimal response one treatment ( MTX , NB-UVB , etanercept ) require discontinue treatment within specified time first dose adalimumab ( see description sub-study group ) . In addition , participant also receive another qualify treatment , he/she require discontinue treatment least 30 day Baseline visit ( Week 0 ) . Adalimumab administer subcutaneous ( SC ) injection . At Baseline Visit ( Week 0 ) , participant receive initial dose 80 mg adalimumab SC . Every week ( odd-numbered week ) Week 1 Week 15 , participant receive 40 mg adalimumab SC . This single group assignment study , , participant receive treatment ; however , data summarize 3 group ( sub-studies ) define psoriasis treatment participant receive enter study : methotrexate , etanercept , narrow-band , ultraviolet-B . Efficacy evaluate use Physician 's Global Assessment ( PGA ) disease severity , patient-reported outcome : Patient 's Global Assessment ( PTGA ) disease severity , Psoriasis-related Pruritus Assessment , Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) , visual analog scale ( VAS ) plaque psoriasis psoriatic arthritis pain , Medical Outcomes Study ( MOS ) Sleep Scale , Work Productivity Activity Impairment Questionnaire : Specific Health Problem ( WPAI : SHP ) . Serious nonserious adverse event summarize sub-study participant ( suboptimal response MTX , suboptimal response NB-UVB , suboptimal response etanercept ) .</detailed_description>
