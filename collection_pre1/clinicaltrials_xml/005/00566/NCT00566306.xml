	<detailed_description>Environmental disinfection prove efficient control epidemic cause C. difficile . In recent year epidemiology change lead increase morbidity mortality many country . C. difficile infection often difficult treat reinfections frequently occur . The major concern new strain C. difficile , O27 , produce many time spore type spread easily institution . Patients C. difficile infection keep contact isolation hospital institution . C. difficile spore form bacteria resistant normally used disinfectant like alcohol quat . Spores may remain viable month environment . Disinfectants currently use , like chloramine glutaralde-hyde , risk worker environment corrosive irritating nature . Polyhexamethyleneguanidine ( PHMG ) new disinfectant effective microbe include bacteria bacterial spore , virus fungi , safe people handle friendly environment surface . It test laboratory Helsinki University accord many EN-standards disinfectant . It use hand disinfectant , instrument disinfectant surface disinfectant . PHMG introduce three ward hand hygiene environmental disinfection CDAD patient ' room . The room shower toilet coat biocide coating ( PHMG ) well bed frame investigational ward . Three ward control ward continue use alcohol base hand disinfectant routine environmental cleaning disinfection quats/chloramines . After 6 month 's intervention period , incidence CDAD case compare preceeding 10 month . Surveillance environmental HCWsÂ´ hand contamination C. difficile perform take microbiological sample environmental site hand twice intervention twice month within intervention period .</detailed_description>
