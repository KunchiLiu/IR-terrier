	<brief_summary>Blood marrow stem cell transplant improve outcome patient high-risk hematologic malignancy . However , patient appropriate HLA ( immune type ) match sibling donor available and/or unable identify acceptable unrelated HLA match donor registry timely manner . Another option haploidentical transplant use partially match family member donor . Although haploidentical transplant proven curative many patient , procedure hinder significant complication , primarily regimen-related toxicity include GVHD infection due delay immune reconstitution . These , part , due certain white blood cell graft call T cell . GVHD happen donor T cell recognize body tissue patient ( host ) different attack cell . Although many T cell increase possibility GVHD , may cause recipient 's immune system reconstitute slowly graft fail grow , leave patient high-risk significant infection . For reason , primary focus researcher engineer graft provide T cell dose reduce risk GVHD , yet provide sufficient number cell facilitate immune reconstitution graft integrity . Building prior institutional trial , study provide patient haploidentical ( HAPLO ) graft engineer specific T cell target value use CliniMACS system . A reduced intensity , preparative regimen use effort reduce regimen-related toxicity mortality . The primary aim study help improve overall survival haploidentical stem cell transplant high risk patient population 1 ) limit complication graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , 2 ) enhance post-transplant immune reconstitution , 3 ) reduce non-relapse mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study explore follow objective : 1 . To assess event-free survival one-year post-transplant research participant high-risk hematologic malignancy improve follow HAPLO hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) use graft deplete CD3+ cell ex vivo reduce intensity-conditioning regimen . Secondary objective : 1 . To estimate one-year overall survival ( OS ) disease-free survival ( DFS ) research participant receive study treatment . 2 . To estimate cumulative incidence relapse research participant receive study treatment . 3 . To estimate rate overall grade III-IV acute GVHD , rate severity chronic GVHD research participant . 4 . To estimate incidence non-hematologic regimen-related toxicity regimen-related mortality first 100 day post-transplant . Exploratory objective : 1 . To explore biologic significance soluble interleukin-2 receptor immunologic state [ quantitative lymphocyte study , V beta spectratyping , T-cell receptor excision circle ( TREC ) assay ] predict development acute chronic GVHD research participant . 2 . To measure pharmacokinetics Campath-1H pediatric HAPLO HSCT recipient NOTE : This protocol originally use muromonab ( OKT3 ) condition regimen prepare participant haploidentical HCT . After muromonab become unavailable manufacturer 2010 , muromonab replace alemtuzumab ( Campath-1H ) use subsequent participant .</detailed_description>
