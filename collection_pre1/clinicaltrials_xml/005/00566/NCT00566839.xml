	<brief_summary>Lung volume reduction surgery effective improve pulmonary function quality life select patient severe emphysema although morbidity surgical procedure still considerable . Morbidity mainly address general anesthesia-related adverse effect surgical trauma derive lung resection . Having develop awake nonresectional lung volume reduction surgery technique , perform sole thoracic epidural anesthesia , hypothesize could offer satisfactory clinical result reduce morbidity rate compare conventional surgical procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Comparison Awake Nonresectional Versus Nonawake Resectional Lung Volume Reduction Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There increase scientific evidence resectional lung volume reduction ( LVR ) induce long lasting clinical improvement select patient upper-lobe predominant emphysema clinical benefit survival well achieve maximized medical treatment . The widely employed surgical technique entail unilateral bilateral staple resection emphysematous lung tissue perform general anesthesia open thoracoscopic approach . However , type surgical approach modify considerable procedure-related morbidity , mainly address general anesthesia surgical trauma derive resection emphysematous lung tissue . Indeed , follow resectional LVR expect mortality pulmonary morbidity 5.5 % 30 % , respectively . Time spent postoperative recover often prolong 30 % patient still hospitalize rehabilitation facility 1 month 15 % still home 2 month operation . As result , cost-effectiveness LVR continue question . In recent year , concept nonresectional LVR investigate new bronchoscopic approach develop attempt reduce typical shortcoming resectional LVR . Within framework propose nonsurgical method differ somewhat physiopathologic base mechanism LVR , common denominator , far , need general anesthesia . We develop awake nonresectional LVR surgery technique , respect basic concept resectional LVR add theoretical advantage perform sole thoracic epidural anesthesia . Following initial pilot study assess feasibility early result , want analyze randomize fashion perioperative morbidity comprehensive 2-year result thoracoscopic lung volume reduction surgery perform awake nonresectional nonawake resectional surgical technique .</detailed_description>
