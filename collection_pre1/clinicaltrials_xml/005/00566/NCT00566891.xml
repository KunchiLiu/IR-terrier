	<brief_title>Safety High-dose Tirofiban During Coronary Angioplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The acute occlusion due intrastent thrombosis represent major event cause acute myocardial infarction , cardiac death necessity new procedure coronary by-pass intervention . To avoid complication different high anticoagulation regimen ( heparin , antiplatelets agent warfarin ) employ . Even effective , treatment accompany high cost side effect due major bleeding ( hemorrhagic stroke , retroperitoneal bleeding , gastrointestinal bleeding , need transfusion , site access complication ) . Pre-treatment aspirin ticlopidine find effective reduce intrastent acute thrombosis . Since several day pre-treatment required become limiting factor interventional procedure force physician adopt two-stage strategy separate diagnostic interventional time increase hospital 's cost patient 's risk . Beside , high dos heparin still require procedure . The introduction GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor initially reserve acute coronary syndrome , later show reduce composite incidence death , myocardial infarction need target vessel revascularization percutaneous coronary intervention . As major benefit arise use drug , interventional procedure could carry end diagnostic procedure major bleeding reduce require low heparin regimen . Nowadays recent guideline management patient acute coronary syndrome strongly recommend use IIb/IIIa inhibitor percutaneous coronary intervention perform . Although several randomized trial different IIb/IIIa inhibitor demonstrate usefulness therapeutic strategy number unsolved issue concern agent use appropriate timing dosage remain explored . The use tirofiban ( 10µ/Kg bolus follow 0.15µ/Kg/min infusion ) PCI evaluate controversial result . The TARGET trial show tirofiban provide significantly less protection PCI abciximab , RESTORE trial find tirofiban significantly reduce combine endpoint comparison heparin alone . The sub-therapeutic inhibition GP IIb/IIIa bind activity invoke , first hour tirofiban treatment , plausible explanation , fact 10µ/Kg bolus employ TARGET study 60 % platelet inhibition achieve first hour . Schneider first propose high dose bolus ( 25µ/Kg bolus follow 0.15µ/Kg/min 18-h infusion ) improve efficacy tirofiban percutaneous coronary intervention extent average inhibition increase first hour 95 % similar achieve abciximab . This observation follow several paper ( short series patient ) compare efficacy safety high dose bolus tirofiban abciximab show similar efficacy IIb-IIIa inhibitor . Among works Danzi ( Brescia I ) , Bolognese ( EVEREST sudy ) ( Arezzo I ) Gunasekara ( Brisbane Au ) . In study number enrol patient slightly enough compare tirofiban abciximab efficacy still uncertain high dose bolus tirofiban could suffer major side effect due bleeding . Even study safety high dose bolus tirofiban disclaim , study population small conclusive data . Actually data available literature large series patient treated high dose bolus tirofiban . S. Anna Hospital Report After preliminary result show similar effect use abciximab high dose bolus tirofiban , September 2002 , start high dose regimen tirofiban good therapeutic result evidence major side effect . Since January 2003 high dose bolus tirofiban adopt routine regimen patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention consider treatment best efficacy cost ratio . The data patient ( 2000 ) collect file could retrieve safety study regard major side effect . Study Endpoints The primary endpoint mortality . Secondary endpoint : incidence major bleed rate site access complication . Major bleeding define cerebrovascular , ( emorrhagic stroke ) , retroperitoneal bleeding , gastrointestinal bleeding , need transfusion . Site access complication define pseudoaneurysm , arteriovenous fistula , major hematoma ( decrease hematocrit level 15 % ) need surgical repair . Sub-groups patient referred institution perform rescue-PCI hour thrombolyses failure treat high dose bolus tirofiban also investigate patient high-risk bleeding side effect . Postdischarge clinical outcome ascertain mean hospital visit information collect refer cardiologist . Statistical Analysis Data obtain 2000 patient 's file write dedicate data form collect mean friendly user , dedicate program , compile study export data file analyse BMDP package . Continuous variable express mean value ± SD , discrete variable express absolute value percentage . Clinical instrumental variable compare use Student 's t- , chi square Fisher 's exact test . For group subgroup analise variance well logistic regression perform . P value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . We plan perform random control check quality data collection interinal analyse 500th patient 's data collect . We think even limitation retrospective study , investigation may high interest thus set base , future , collect perform prospective analyse data , comparison ( random allocation , 3 1 design ) different agent ( ) .</detailed_description>
