	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : The use intrauterine levonorgestrel may prevent atypical endometrial hyperplasia endometrial cancer woman hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer Lynch syndrome . It yet know whether intrauterine levonorgestrel observation effective observation alone prevent atypical endometrial hyperplasia endometrial cancer woman hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer Lynch syndrome . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study intrauterine levonorgestrel observation see well work compare observation alone prevent atypical endometrial hyperplasia endometrial cancer woman hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer Lynch syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intrauterine Levonorgestrel Observation Observation Alone Preventing Atypical Endometrial Hyperplasia Endometrial Cancer Women With Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer Lynch Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine treatment intrauterine levonorgestrel ( use Mirena® intrauterine system [ IUS ] ) reduce incidence atypical endometrial hyperplasia ( AEH ) endometrial cancer woman hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer Lynch syndrome . Secondary - Determine age-related incidence AEH endometrial cancer patient . - Determine sensitivity specificity transvaginal sonography endometrial biopsy detect AEH endometrial cancer . - Determine premalignant pathway carcinoma . - Determine Mirena® IUS reduce rate therapeutic hysterectomy AEH endometrial cancer . - Determine psychological benefit adverse effect use Mirena® IUS . - Determine satisfaction compliance screening . - Determine extent adverse effect Mirena® IUS observation . - Determine molecular change associate pre-malignant change endometrium patient , possibly utility test cervical mucus sample diagnose endometrial cancer . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify center menopausal status . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo insertion Mirena® intrauterine device contain levonorgestrel . The device schedule remain place 4 year . Patients also undergo observation comprise assessment menstrual history , transvaginal scanning ( TVS ) , endometrial biopsy ( hysteroscopy ) baseline annually 4 year . - Arm II : Patients undergo observation comprise assessment menstrual history , TVS , endometrial biopsy ( hysteroscopy ) baseline annually 4 year . Patients complete personal health lifestyle questionnaire , Life Events Scale , Profile Mood States ( POMS ) questionnaires baseline periodically study .
