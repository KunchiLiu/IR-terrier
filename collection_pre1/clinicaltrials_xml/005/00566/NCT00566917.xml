	<brief_summary>Pelvic organ prolapse characterized lack pelvic floor support cause pelvic organ vaginal wall protrude . For decade , suture repair technique primary choice surgical treatment indicate . Traditional surgical technique frequently associate unsatisfying anatomical recurrence rate plausible inherently weak , damage , pelvic floor supportive tissue need reinforce permanent support avoid high rate recurrence commonly describe use traditional technique . Over year sporadic attempt make introduce novel surgical technique use variety biomaterials vary success . Despite lack clinical safety data , compel clinical evidence demonstrate improves outcomes compare traditional suture technique , use biomaterials pelvic reconstructive surgery become widespread year . It likely biomaterials need `` anchored '' tissue afflict disease , order provide intend pelvic floor support . This give rise transvaginal surgical technique use transobturator approach pass mesh arcus tendineous fascia pelvis , sacrospinous ligament transgluteal approach . Short term data conclude on-going safety assessment technique provide promising result satisfy clinical outcome . The aim present study compare anterior mesh repair ( PROLIFT® ) traditional suture repair randomise trial .</brief_summary>
