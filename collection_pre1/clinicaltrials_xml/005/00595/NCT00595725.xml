	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn surgical technique call intraoperative lymphatic mapping accurately identify lymph node great risk endometrial cervical cancer spread lymph node . Early cervical cancer usually treat remove cervix , tissue around cervix , upper vagina . If need , uterus also remove . The treatment also include remove lymph node pelvis . Endometrial cancer usually treat remove cervix , uterus , fallopian tube ovary . The treatment also include remove lymph node pelvis .</brief_summary>
