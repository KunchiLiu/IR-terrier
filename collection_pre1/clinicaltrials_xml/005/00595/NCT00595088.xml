	<brief_summary>This study design assess efficacy safety DTA-H19/PEI give six intravesical instillation 20 mg plasmid DNA complexed PEI bladder patient intermediate risk superficial bladder cancer [ recurrent stage Ta ( low high grade ) T1 , ( low grade ) transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) ] fail prior intravesical therapy include either Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) chemotherapy . The primary efficacy objective determine effect DTA-H19/PEI prevention new tumor induction course 6 weekly intravesical administration investigational product assess 8 10 week start treatment . Secondary objective include assess ablative effect DTA-H19/PEI marker tumor , safety assess incidence severity adverse event , determine long-term ( 46 week ) continue rate absence bladder cancer , time tumor recurrence patient complete response ( CR ) induction course .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DTA-H19 , double strand DNA plasmid carry gene diphtheria toxin A ( DT-A ) chain regulation H19 promoter sequence . This Patient-Oriented , Targeted Therapy DT-A chain expression trigger presence H19 transcription factor upregulated tumor cell . The selective initiation toxin expression result selective tumor cell destruction via inhibition protein synthesis tumor cell , enable highly targeted cancer treatment .</detailed_description>
