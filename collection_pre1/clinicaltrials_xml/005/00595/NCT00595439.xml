	<brief_summary>This study investigate difference among people focal dystonia ( FD ) , complex regional pain syndrome ( CRPS ) people condition learn cause disorder . Participants undergo follow procedure five visit : - Electroencephalography ( EEG ) . Electrodes ( metal disc ) place scalp electrode cap , paste glue-like substance . The space electrodes scalp fill gel conduct electrical activity . Brain wave record subject lie quietly sensory stimulation apply thumb finger . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . This test use magnetic field radio wave obtain image body tissue organ . The patient lie table slide scanner , wear earplug muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . The procedure last 45 minute , time patient ask lie still 15 minute time . - Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . An insulated wire coil place scalp brief electrical current pass coil . The current induces magnetic field stimulate brain . There may pull sensation skin coil twitch muscle face , arm leg . During stimulation , subject may ask keep hand relax contract certain muscle . - Peripheral electrical stimulation . In two experiment , TMS combine peripheral electrical stimulation , similar use nerve conduction study , median nerve wrist . There may muscle twitch . - Surface electromyography . For TMS test peripheral electrical stimulation , electrodes fill conductive gel tap skin record electrical activity three muscle right hand . - Needle EMG . A needle inserted muscle record electrical activity . - Nerve conduction study . A probe place skin deliver small electrical stimulus , wire tap skin record nerve impulse . These study measure speed nerve conduct electrical impulse strength connection nerve muscle . - Skin biopsy . Two site biopsied . A local anesthetic give numb area 1/4-inch piece skin remove special tool . - JVP dome . Subjects test ability discriminate sensory stimulus affect region side . They ask discriminate stamp groove different width apply hand foot .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE Dystonia generally regard motor execution abnormality due central nervous system dysfunction cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical motor loop . Regional trauma consider risk factor development focal dystonia ( FD ) affect limb . Since focal limb trauma also associate complex regional pain syndrome ( CRPS ) , may common underlie pathology condition . In CRPS , many patient small fiber neuropathy . The goal propose research distinguish ( discriminate ) among three disease category ( FD , FD+CRPS , CRPS ) , find whether FD CRPS share common physiological substrate represent two side spectrum , see clinical situation may secondary underlie small fiber neuropathy . Independent study conduct patient affected upper limb affect low limb . STUDY POPULATION We intend perform two study overall 90 subject . One study ass affect upper limb 15 patient unilateral focal dystonia , 15 patient CRPS 15 patient focal dystonia CRPS , second study test affect low limb 15 patient unilateral focal dystonia , 15 patient CRPS 15 patient focal dystonia CRPS low limb . DESIGN We propose explore central aspect ( somatosensory evoke potential , SEPS , transcranial magnetic stimulation , TMS ) patient upper limb disorder , cortical representation hand muscle easier study low limb muscle representation . In contrast , peripheral study ( quantitative EMG nerve conduction ) perform patient low limb disorder , due length , accessibility separation pure motor sensory nerve leg . OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure central nervous system feature ( upper limb assessment ) difference EEG dipole localization SEPs thumb index finger three group assess possible disturbance cortical representation primary sensory cortex . TMS measure exploratory . The primary outcome measure low limb test duration motor unit action potential ( MUAP ) ass difference subtle lesion , pick clinical routine due big confidence interval single parameter . The unaffected side primary target study since look underlying substrate ; however , clinical test perform bilaterally ( tolerated subject ) comparison side secondary outcome measure .</detailed_description>
