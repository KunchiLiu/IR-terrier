	<brief_summary>This pilot study . The goal study test whether Bevacizumab safe enough patient brain tumor large study conduct . This study also give u information whether combination Bevacizumab radiation potential become effective treatment regrow brain tumor . Bevacizumab experimental drug block molecule call VEGF find high amount malignant glioma . VEGF promote growth blood vessel bring nutrient tumor cell . In study laboratory animal , Bevacizumab slow growth several different type human cancer cell block effect VEGF . There also evidence Bevacizumab enhance effect radiation tumor cell</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Recurrent malignant glioma fail prior radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy . Surgery recurrence may offer select patient prior receive bevacizumab IMRT protocol . MRI scan gadolinium contrast show geographicallycircumscribed tumor &lt; equal 3.5cm . ( Scan must perform steroid dosage stable least 5 day . If steroid dose increase date imaging registration , new baseline MRI require ) . Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy : An interval &gt; equal 4 week ( 28 day ) prior cytotoxic therapy An interval &gt; equal 1 week ( 7 day ) noncytotoxic agent An interval &gt; equal 6 week ( 42 day ) completion radiation therapy Absolute neutrophil count &gt; equal 1,500/mm3 . Platelet count &gt; equal 100,000/mm3 . Hemoglobin &gt; equal 10 g/dl . BUN serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal . Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal . SGOT SGPT &lt; equal 3 time upper limit normal . Alkaline phosphatase &lt; equal 2 time upper limit normal . &gt; equal 18 year age . Karnofsky Performance Score &gt; equal 70 Life expectancy &gt; equal 12 week Men woman reproductive potential must agree use acceptable method birth control treatment six month completion treatment . Patient legal proxy must provide write informed consent prior registration study . Current , recent ( within 4 week first infusion study ) , plan participation experimental drug study Genentechsponsored bevacizumab cancer study . Blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg systolic and/or &gt; 100 mmHg diastolic Any prior history hypertensive crisis hypertensive encephalopathy Unstable angina within 12 month study enrollment CTC 3.0 Grade 2 great congestive heart failure History myocardial infarction within 12 month study enrollment History stroke transient ischemic attack time Known CNS disease Known hypersensitivity component bevacizumab History peptic ulcer within last 6 month Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease Evidence bleed diathesis coagulopathy Use ongoing anticoagulant antiplatelet agent ( aspirin , NSAIDS , etc ) Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior first dose bevacizumab anticipation need major surgical procedure course study . ( Recently resect patient may enrol onstudy two week postsurgery . However , treatment Bevacizumab begin 28 day surgical procedure patient . ) Craniotomy wound sufficiently heal Minor surgical procedure , fine needle aspiration core biopsy within 7 day prior study enrollment Pregnant ( positive pregnancy test ) lactate Urine protein : creatinine ratio â‰¥1.0 screen History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 6 month prior study enrollment Serious , nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture Lung carcinoma squamous cell histology histology close proximity major vessel , cavitation , history hemoptysis Inability comply study and/or followup procedure Glioma show prior spontaneous hemorrhage determine clinical history preoperative CT MRI scan .</criteria>
