	<brief_summary>This new invention address inadequate incomplete visualization cervix patient excessive vaginal tissue . In general patient obese , multiparous history multiple vaginal delivery . A vaginal speculum vital medical instrument allow health care provider visualize interior aspect vagina , well distal portion uterus , cervix . It compose 2 blade assemble together hold handle . The blade handle form 90 degree-angle . As user hold handle , lever attach top blade allow open away inferior blade . When instrument insert vagina , two blade separate order keep anterior posterior vaginal wall apart . In position , cervix wall vagina see patient excess loose vaginal tissue . However , patient excessive tissue , sidewalls vagina simply collapse toward midline blade fact part speculum direct contact lateral wall vagina . This collapse prevent complete crucial visualization cervix purpose cervical culture , pap smear , visual assessment rupture membrane , visual assessment degree dilation , biopsy , procedure require access cervix uterus . When clinician face dilemma , may try large speculum available , open wide possible order keep lateral wall apart . Most often , improvise cut tip condom , thumb glove , use sterile lateral-wall retractor . These creative solution take several minute precious time may still result inadequate visualization suboptimal access . A vaginal speculum sheath retain vaginal tissue lateral direction conforms pair blade movable open position close position . The blade close position adapt insertion vagina , open position , allow dilate vagina order provide access cervix . This new design include flexible , transparent polyurethane sleeve structure extend blade speculum open . The stretched sheath adapt retain lateral wall vagina open position . The elastic sleeve design remain collapsed configuration blade close position avoid interfere insertion withdrawal speculum [ Reference : U.S. patent 6432048 ( 2002-8-13 ) ] . Polyurethane material FDA approve vaginal use . The purpose study compare standard care speculum vs. sheathe speculum examination patient collapse vaginal sidewall gynecological speculum exam . The primary hypothesis test study compare standard care speculum exam sheathe speculum exam prospective , randomized clinical trial .</brief_summary>
