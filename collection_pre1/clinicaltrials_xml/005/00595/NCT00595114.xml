	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) asthma common respiratory disease people experience long-term inflammation lung . Exacerbations , prolong worsening symptom , asthma COPD often life-threatening lead frequent need hospitalization . Even proper use bronchodilator , corticosteroid , currently available medication , clinical response among people COPD asthma variable . There remain significant unmet clinical need new therapeutic approach insight , include identification biomarkers accurately assess presence airway infection intensity airway inflammation . This study investigate potential natural biological cause new biomarkers increase susceptibility persistent airway infection asthma COPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Association Between Increased Oxidative Stress , Anti-Inflammatory Fatty Acid Formation , Airway Infection People With Asthma Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD asthma chronic lung diseases result impaired air flow lung , often cause cough , wheeze , shortness breath . In uncontrolled COPD asthma , people may experience rapid worsening symptom , may include fever , difficulty breathing , chest pain . These exacerbation serious expression asthma COPD usually cause lung infection air allergen . However , biological basis susceptibility airway infection inflammation well understood . Increased oxidative stress within airway link several airway disease . This increase oxidative stress may reduce production key fatty acid anti-inflammatory mediator . In turn , may disrupt airway 's natural immune response mechanism , make airway vulnerable infection inflammation COPD asthma exacerbation . This ancillary study determine whether susceptibility persistent airway infection asthma COPD stem increase oxidative stress impairs natural formation protective fatty acid mediator . This ancillary study use data biological sample , include blood sputum , participant currently enrol Macrolides Asthma ( MIA ; NCT00318708 ) Antileukotriene Therapy COPD Exacerbations ( KIA ; NCT01097694 ) . Biological sample undergo fatty acid mediator analysis RNA isolation . There study visit study .</detailed_description>
