	<brief_title>Emergency Bedside Ultrasound Pediatric Soft Tissue Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Skin soft tissue infection , particularly abscess cause community-acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( CA-MRSA ) grow public health problem . The treatment skin abscess usually require incision drainage needle aspiration . In addition provide definitive therapy , appropriate drainage allow organism identification antibiotic susceptibility test antibiotic utilized . A skin cellulitis , treat systemic antibiotic supportive care alone , may hard distinguish abscess , similar clinical feature . Therefore , presence absence purulent material may difficult determine , child may undergo unnecessary drainage procedure . If drainage avoid , patient may require subsequent ED visit diagnosis miss initial examination . This lead worsen clinical outcome , extra financial burden family , add emotional distress patient . Bedside emergency ultrasound ( EUS ) , use since mid-1980s use adult detect fluid collection soft tissue abscess . Studies adult patient show EUS add useful information history physical examination may even alter physician ' clinical impression management patient . Currently , know whether child represent different population EUS adult EUS would perform pediatric outpatient set . With improved diagnosis soft tissue infection , good epidemiologic data organism prevalence , improve prompt treatment , appropriate use antibiotic therapy do . To date , study exists evaluate utility specifically evaluation soft tissue infection pediatric patient . The goal study evaluate test characteristic EUS pediatric patient present evidence soft tissue infection .</detailed_description>
