Scheduled clinically indicated stress echocardiography stress SPECT within 14 day prior follow Study Day 1 ( prior coronary angiography ) coronary angiography within 7 day follow Study Day 1 4 . Technically adequate unreconstructed stress SPECT data schedule clinically indicated stress SPECT within 14 day Study Day 1 prior coronary angiography 5 . Adequate visualization myocardial segment least one view noncontrast echocardiography ( See Section 5.3.1 ) 6 . No evidence righttoleft shunt noncontrast echocardiography Stratum 2 : 1 . Able provide write informed consent 2 . Intermediate ( 10 % 90 % ) pretest probability CAD ( Appendix D ) 3 . Scheduled clinically indicated coronary angiography within 7 day follow Study Day 1 4 . Technically adequate unreconstructed stress SPECT data schedule stress SPECT within 14 day Study Day 1 prior coronary angiography 5 . Adequate visualization myocardial segment least one view noncontrast echocardiography ( See Section 5.3.1 ) 6 . No evidence righttoleft shunt noncontrast echocardiography Stratum 3 : 1 . Able provide write informed consent 2 . High ( great 90 % ) pretest probability CAD ( Appendix D ) 3 . Scheduled clinically indicated coronary angiography within 7 day follow Study Day 1 4 . Technically adequate unreconstructed stress SPECT data schedule stress SPECT within 14 day Study Day 1 prior coronary angiography 5 . Adequate visualization myocardial segment least one view noncontrast echocardiography ( See Section 5.3.1 ) 6 . No evidence righttoleft shunt noncontrast echocardiography 1 . Women pregnant lactate 2 . Known hypersensitivity know contraindication : 1 . Dipyridamole 2 . Ultrasound contrast agent ( include PB127 excipients ) 3 . Blood , blood product , albumin , egg , protein 3 . Use caffeine xanthine containing product within 24 hour prior PB127 MCE 4 . Previous exposure PB127 Ultrasound Contrast Agent 5 . Heart transplant 6 . Known righttoleft shunt include atrial septal defect 7 . Current history uncontrolled ventricular tachycardia 8 . Current atrial fibrillation , atrial tachycardia , atrial flutter 9 . Pacemaker defibrillator 10 . Unstable cardiac status 1 . Unstable angina grade CCS Class IV severity ongoing symptom and/or ongoing infusion intravenous nitroglycerin ( See Appendix F ) 2 . Seconddegree great heart block 3 . Frequent ( &gt; 60/hour ) symptomatic ventricular ectopics baseline 4 . Hypertension ( SPB &gt; 200 and/or DBP &gt; 110 mmHg two consecutive reading within one hour PB127 MCE ) 5 . Hypotension ( SPB &lt; 90 mmHg ) 6 . Severe aortic stenosis ( &gt; 100 mmHg peak transvalvar gradient &lt; 0.6 cm2 estimate valve area ) 7 . Pulmonary edema within 7 day prior Study Day 1 8 . Resting oxygen saturation le 90 % 9 . Qwave myocardial infarction within 7 day prior Study Day 1 10 . PTCA CABG within 7 day prior Study Day 1 11 . Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) bronchospastic airway disease , opinion Investigator , significant enough contraindicate dipyridamole 12 . Known history severe pulmonary hypertension characterize estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure &gt; 50 mmHg 13 . Use intravenous intracoronary contrast agent thallium technetium within 24 hour prior Study Day 1 14 . Liver disease ( i.e. , current previous hepatic viral infection , chronic hepatitis ) characterize one follow 1 . Current jaundice 2 . Elevated bilirubin &gt; upper limit normal 3 . Currently elevate hepatic enzyme &gt; 2X upper limit normal 15 . Medical condition circumstance would significantly decrease chance obtain reliable data achieve study objective ( i.e. , drug dependence , psychiatric disorder , dementia , associate illness ) , extenuate circumstance , medical condition make unlikely patient complete clinical trial followup evaluation , reason expect poor compliance Investigator 's instruction</criteria>
