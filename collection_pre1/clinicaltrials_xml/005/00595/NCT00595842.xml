	<brief_title>Artificial Root-End Barriers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The normal development maturation root depend vital , healthy pulp . If pulp become necrotic tooth immature apex , endodontic treatment perform use artificial barrier technique . Mineral trioxide aggregate ( MTA ) become material choice accomplish procedure , however , study evaluate clinical success . The purpose retrospective study determine clinical success ProRoot MTA use artificial apical barrier . Twenty patient include study . After approximately one week Ca ( OH ) 2 treatment , patient MTA place apical barrier tooth single canal open apex follow placement final restoration . Patients recall evaluated clinical sign symptoms osseous healing . Immediate post-treatment recall radiograph evaluate two endodontist calibrate use Periapical Index ( PAI ) .</detailed_description>
