	<brief_summary>The purpose research study : ( 1 ) determine combination low dose total body irradiation , low dose cyclophosphamide addition fludarabine , serum suppress immune system allow select stem cell take grow ; ( 2 ) determine select stem cell blood marrow take cause graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) , ; ( 3 ) evaluate side effect combination low dose radiation chemotherapy drug use transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Treatment Patients With Fanconi Anemia Lacking Genotypically Identical Donor , Using Total Body Irradiation , Cyclophosphamide Fludarabine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients disease born fragility gene ( chromosome ) cell body . The fragility chromosome put patient FA high risk certain cancer . Patients FA especially risk disease blood marrow system . These include ( 1 ) aplastic anemia , disease failure bone marrow make blood cell ( 2 ) myelodysplastic syndrome represent clone cell marrow become `` malignant '' stop make adequate number blood cell ( also call preleukemia . ) The progression myelodysplastic syndrome lead ( 3 ) acute leukemia . If Fanconi anemia suffer aplastic anemia , myelodysplastic syndrome , leukemia standard treatment medication chemotherapy alone likely cure problem . An allogeneic blood bone marrow ( hematopoietic stem cell ) transplant do provide marrow blood stem cell healthy donor develop normal blood forming system . An allogeneic stem cell transplant cure problem marrow blood system . It cure chromosome fragility whole body . When allogeneic stem cell transplant do treatment FA use stem cell donor match sibling , associate high risk rejection transplant complication call graft-versus-host disease . In order stem cell grow kill leukemia cell , patient must receive chemotherapy radiation therapy . This preparation call cytoreduction . For patient Fanconi anemia , standard preparation stem cell transplantation use total body irradiation ( low dose high risk side-effects ) chemotherapy agent call cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) also low dose . While work well transplant match sibling , enough transplant unrelated cord blood donor lead high risk rejection . In last year medication call fludarabine use successfully transplant give immunosuppression kill T-cells . Fludarabine allow transplant do low risk rejection , probably importantly little risk add side-effects . The addition antithymocyte globulin Total Body Irradiation , cyclophosphamide fludarabine make chance rejection low .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis : Research participant must diagnosis Fanconi anemia ( confirm mitomycin diepoxybutane [ DEB ] chromosomal breakage test ) . Hematologic Diagnosis Status : Research participant must one follow hematologic diagnosis : Severe Aplastic Anemia ( SAA ) /Severe Isolated Single lineage Cytopenia Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) Acute leukemia . HLAcompatible Unrelated volunteer donor : Research participant relate HLAmatched donor unrelated donor either match A , B DRB1 locus mismatch 1/6 locus ( A , B , DRB1 ) test DNA analysis , eligible entry protocol . HLAmismatched Related donor : Research participant relate unrelated HLAcompatible donor must healthy family member least HLAhaplotype identical recipient . First degree relate donor must normal DEB test . The donor must healthy willing able ( 1 ) receive 5 day course GCSF undergo 2 daily leukaphereses , ( 2 ) undergo general anesthesia bone marrow donation . In order undergo Tcell depletion , donor able volume 15 ml/Kg research participant 's body weight harvest safely . HLAcompatible Cord Blood Units : Research participant relate HLAmatched donor unrelated placental cord blood unit match A , B DRB1 locus mismatch 1/6 2/6 locus ( A , B , DRB1 ) test DNA analysis , eligible entry protocol . Research participant may either gender ethnic background . Research participant must Karnofsky adult , Lansky pediatric performance scale status &gt; 70 % . At time referral transplantation , research participant must good clinical condition without coexist medical problem would significantly increase risk transplant procedure . Research participant must free infection time transplant . Research participant must life expectancy great 8 week . Research participant must adequate physical function measure cardiac , Hepatic , Renal , Pulmonary . Research participant must available followup evaluation 30 , 60 , 180 day post BMT yearly 5 year . Active CNS leukemic involvement Female research participant pregnant breastfeed Active viral , bacterial fungal infection Research participant seropositive HIVI/II ; HTLV I/II</criteria>
