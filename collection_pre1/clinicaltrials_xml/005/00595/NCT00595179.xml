	<brief_summary>Current assessment organ tissue viability surgeon operate room limited crude estimate overt physical examination , measurement laboratory value physical measurement vascular flow resistance . The ability non-invasively measure tissue perfusion oxygenation would provide surgeon improve mean assess injured organ survive . The recent development real time infrared ( IR ) Near Infrared Imaging Spectroscopy ( NIRIS ) digital camera allow determination tissue perfusion oxygenation non-invasive fashion . Although early stage development , application infrared NIRS technology hold great promise permit surgeon good ass viability tissue way possible . We propose evaluate infrared NIRS technology assessment kidney allograft use data previously collect recipient operation NIH .</brief_summary>
