	<brief_title>Sterimar v Saline Sprays Nasal Surgical Aftercare - Blinded , Randomised Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Project Proposal Sterimar v Saline Sprays nasal surgical aftercare - blind , randomise trial . Gundula Thiel , Andy Evans , Kim Ah-See Background Patients undergo nasal surgery commonly experience variety symptom post-operative period include blockage , run , pain , bleed reduction sense smell . A variety preparation currently recommend symptomatic relief post operative period . These include saline irrigation sniff , steam inhalation , decongestant steroid drop . These intend reduce swell crust resultant symptom . There currently level 1 evidence literature support use particular preparation others nasal surgical aftercare . A recent randomise control trial carry department , compare use xylometazoline base decongestant vs Sterimar seawater nasal spray , show low pain score Sterimar group significant difference . This study yet unpublished . Sterimar spray spray make seawater dilute make solution isotonic . Traditionally , form Saline sniff rinse also use mention application . It easy make isotonic saline solution , use 5 gram salt ( 1 teaspoon ) every Â½ litre boil water . This , cooling , apply nasal cavity help standard 10 ml syringe provide patient discharge . As Sterimar yet hospital formulary , cost treatment currently borne patient . For duration study , patient randomize Sterimar group provide medication free charge . We consider unlikely patient randomise saline spray group supplement treatment buy saline spray chemist expense . To establish follow patient trial period , establish research clinic . Patients review clinic dedicated patient take part trial approximately 2 week surgery , completion trial period . The trial help establish efficacy symptom control advantage one solution delivery device . If home-made saline spray could use similar effect Sterimar , cost form surgical aftercare could lower significantly , patient NHS . We propose conduct single blind , randomise trial compare saline spray vs Sterimar , commercially available aerosolise isotone saline solution , compare patient ' symptom score follow septal surgery . The MHRA confirm neither Sterimar home make saline spray consider Investigational Medicinal Products . Methodology Setting ENT unit , Aberdeen Royal Infirmary , teach hospital Inclusions / exclusion Patients undergo septoplasty septoplasty conjunction turbinate surgery recruit . Those undergoing additional procedure include polypectomy exclude , patient whose post-operative recommendation steroid take home medication may bias result . Recruitment Patients fit inclusion criterion approach Outpatients clinic . The decision septoplasty +/- turbinate surgery make consent operation take . A patient information sheet administer lead investigator medical staff day , allow patient ample time discuss matter relatives medical staff . Patients leave read information sheet re-approached ass willingness include trial . The procedure trial explain informed consent take part obtain . Patients retain patient information sheet well receive score sheet contain visual analogue scale assess symptom - pain , run , sense smell , bleeding , blockage . A questionnaire assess use post-operative analgesia 7 day daily basis also include . All form appropriately head paper . A clear explanation complete assessment sheet give . The patient approach pre-operative morning Patients randomise use randomisation schedule generate NHS Grampian Research &amp; Development Dept . withdraw his/her consent trial time . Randomisation Patients randomise use randomisation schedule generate NHS Grampian Research &amp; Development Dept . Treatment Based randomisation , patient give one either saline spray Sterimar Physiological Sea Water Microspray . Instructions regard use give include frequency technique . Outcome measure On 3rd 7th postoperative day , patient complete symptom assessment sheet judging symptom day . The patient record painkiller need Analgesia Requirement Sheet daily basis 7 day . The patient also provide EQ-5D health questionnaire , well validated referent look value population ill healthy patient . These return pre-paid envelope identifiable patient ' study number retain randomisation program . Analysis Visual analogue scale analyze investigator blind treatment administer . Results analyse compare score achieve take saline sniff take Sterimar . Tests statistical significance perform establish either preparation superior symptom control . Analgesia use take consideration . To select difference symptom score visual analogue scale 10mm level significance 80 % power , sample size 60 patient require arm trial . This assume standard deviation 19mm , demonstrate study previously conduct department .</detailed_description>
