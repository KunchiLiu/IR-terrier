	<brief_summary>This additional study primary Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) study ( LSU # H04-049 ; NCT00243451 ) underway PET detection Mild Cognitive Impairment . This study preliminary data indicate objective analysis PET brain image metabolic data sensitive marker AD . The goal proposal determine efficacy curcumin treatment MCI mild Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Intervention Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) With Curcumin + Bioperine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim study include : - Determine curcumin effect neuropsychological score patient MCI . Working Hypothesis : Patients MCI evidence objective memory impairment improvement neuropsychological test score . - Determine curcumin impact metabolic lesion find patient MCI may develop MCI . Working hypothesis : The metabolic lesion present consistent development early AD improve curcumin treatment . Patients diagnose MCI , patient metabolic lesion consistent premorbid MCI , mild AD currently enrol primary MCI study ( LSU # H04-049 ; NCT00243451 ) invite participate clinical trial . These subject treat 5.4 gram curcumin per day ( 900 mg pill , two pill 3X/day meal ) inclusion bioperine additive ( formulate curcumin capsule ) improve bioavailability curcumin . Patients treat curcumin/bioperine 24 month concordant last two year three year longitudinal primary MCI study . Clinical endpoint change neuropsychological score , size metabolic lesion PET scan . Both measure record part primary MCI study .</detailed_description>
