	<brief_summary>The purpose study find well long-acting beta agonist like salmeterol work people different form gene . Our hypothesis asthmatic Arg/Arg genotype loss bronchoprotection exercise-induced asthma regular salmeterol treatment , compare asthmatic Gly/Gly genotype .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>How Different Beta-2 Receptor Genotypes Affect Asthmatic 's Response Regular Salmeterol Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In many patient asthma , exercise-induced bronchoconstriction common oftentimes limit characteristic . Inhaled β2-adrenoreceptor agonist like albuterol effective treatment available relief acute asthma symptom . However , evidence regular use may lead adverse effect patient . Previous study show polymorphisms β2-adrenergic receptor influence airway responses regular inhaled beta-agonist treatment . Pharmacogenetics study genetic difference influence variability patient ' response therapy , therapeutic adverse . Genetic susceptibility environmental factor play major role etiology asthma . The strong familial clustering asthma lead surge research genetic predisposition asthma . The aim present study utilize double-blinded prospective cohort study investigate whether genotype-specific effect occur assess duration protection confer exercise-induced bronchoconstriction regular salmeterol treatment .</detailed_description>
