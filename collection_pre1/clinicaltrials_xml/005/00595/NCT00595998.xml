	<detailed_description>It one encounter visit patient enrol complete study day . This allow recruiting test patient CNV dynamic disease often treat day . Following enrollment , patient go examiner supervise tutorial follow self-performed HMP examination . In addition patient undergo Amsler grid examination , biomicroscopy , color fundus photography fluorescein angiography . The HMP output shall test result within outside normal limit . Inherent test reliability criterion help determine patient perform test reliably . These consist false positive false negative error . All criterion normal limit reliable performance set prior study initiation . The outcome measure study sensitivity identify visual functional defect patient CNV .</detailed_description>
