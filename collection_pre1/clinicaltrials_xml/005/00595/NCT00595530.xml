	<brief_summary>Acute pain episode associate sickle cell disease ( SCD ) difficult manage effectively . Opioid tolerance side effect major roadblock ability provide patient adequate pain relief . This pilot study design examine safety feasibility use ketamine , N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist , inpatient see child adolescent sickle cell vasoocclusive pain . Previous research suggest subanesthetic dos , ketamine may able prevent development opiate tolerance facilitate well pain relief low opiate dos , allow less respiratory depression , less sedation , easy ambulation , less deconditioning , short hospital stay , good quality life . The goal pilot study evaluate safety feasibility use continuous infusion ketamine , conjunction opiate , inpatient set sickle cell vasoocclusive pain . It hypothesize use low dose ketamine infusion conjunction opiates safe feasible practice treatment sickle cell pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>3.2 Study Design/Type 1 . Patient meeting inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol 24 hour admission vasoocclusive episode . 2 . Prior onset ketamine infusion , follow information collect : 1 . Demographic information ( age , gender , SCD genotype , past history SCD-related complication ) [ Obtained patient 's medical chart ] 2 . Opiate utilization/hour since admission [ Obtained patient 's medical chart ] 3 . Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) score since admission [ Obtained patient 's medical chart ] 4 . Sedation score ( University Michigan Sedation Scale ) obtain [ By nurse staff ] 5 . Body outline figure Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool ( validate age 7 ) administer [ By research staff ] 6 . Ketamine Effects Scale ( KES ) administer patient [ By research staff ] 3 . Ketamine infusion begin 0.05 mg/kg/hour . 4 . After infusion initiate : 1 . Vital sign take every hour two hour infusion begin , two hour , every four hour remainder hospitalization [ Completed nursing staff ] 2 . Pain score record vital sign patient awake [ Completed nursing staff ] 3 . Patient also ask pain lot well , little good , change , little bad , lot worse previous assessment [ Completed nursing staff ] 4 . Sedation score ( University Michigan Sedation Scale ) assess pain score [ Completed nursing staff ] 5 . Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool ( APPT ) body outline figure complete patient per day 3 pm 5 pm . [ Administered research staff ] 6 . Ketamine Effects Scale ( KES ) administer patient per day 3pm 5pm [ By research staff ] 7 . Patient monitor side effect include dream , disorientation , dysphoria , agitation , CNS depression , respiratory depression , increase hypoxia , nausea , vomit [ Completed nursing research staff ] 8 . Need supplemental oxygen record ( oxygen saturation &lt; 95 % ) [ Completed nursing staff ] 9 . Opiate use NSAID use/6 hour record [ Completed nursing research staff ] 5 . The infusion may discontinue decreased time due unacceptable side effect determine clinician , patient , parent , principal investigator . 6 . Agents design reduce ketamine side effect [ midazolam ( Versed ) , clonidine , lorazepam ( Ativan ) , diazepam ( Valium ) ] may administer discretion attend physician principal investigator . 7 . 4 hour infusion begin , infusion rate may increase 0.1 mg/kg/hour follow parameter meet : 1. patient 's pain improve acceptable range ( pain score still â‰¥5 ) 2. side effect remain acceptable 8 . 4 hour previous increase ketamine infusion may increase 0.15 mg/kg/hour per parameter . 9 . 4 hour previous increase ketamine infusion may increase 0.2 mg/kg/hour per parameter . 10 . The ketamine infusion discontinue time transition oral pain medication , 72 hour initiation , request clinician , patient , parent , principal investigator . 11 . Pain score , vital sign , sedation score , opiate use , APPT body outline figure , KES score record remainder hospitalization . 12 . Total length hospitalization record . 13 . Patient contact weekly basis 4 week follow hospitalization review potential side effect , pain episode , event lead re-admission . 14 . The patient 's medical record review determine duration previous hospitalization SCD pain previous 24 month opiate utilization , pain score , transition oral opiate hospitalization . 3.3 Randomization This conduct pilot study ; patient randomize . 3.4 Duration The length patient 's participation study duration hospitalization , well 4 week worth follow-up phone call . 3.5 Discontinuation Individual patient stop receive ketamine develop acute chest syndrome ( ACS ) , stroke , transfer Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) , hemoglobin fall 5 mg/dl , experience unacceptable side effect , request PI , attend , patient , parent . However , continue study data collect throughout duration hospitalization . The entire trial terminate 20 patient complete protocol , unexpected rate acute chest syndrome admission pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) .</detailed_description>
