	<brief_summary>Heart failure disorder heart pump blood adequately . This lead several serious problem , include reduce blood flow throughout body , congestion blood vein lung , fluid accumulation various organ limbs . Diuretics often use address problem fluid accumulation , optimal dose amount time administer dose unclear . This study compare high low dos diuretic administer longer short period time determine safest effective combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determining Optimal Dose Duration Diuretic Treatment People With Acute Heart Failure ( The DOSE-AHF Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure common disorder heart pump enough blood meet need rest body . Heart failure symptom include shortness breath , swell , fatigue . Standard treatment swell associate heart failure include use diuretic medication , furosemide , cause urination removal excess fluid body . Although furosemide use treat heart failure patient many year , still unclear much drug use , time period drug give . This study evaluate whether furosemide treatment safer effective drug give high dos versus low dos two three separate dos versus one continuous infusion . Participants study begin study procedure within first 24 hour hospital admission heart failure . Participants randomly assign receive one follow four treatment : high dose furosemide via continuous intravenous ( IV ) infusion placebo every 12 hour via IV bolus ; low dose furosemide via continuous IV infusion placebo every 12 hour via IV bolus ; high dose furosemide every 12 hour via IV bolus placebo via continuous IV infusion ; low dose furosemide every 12 hour via IV bolus placebo via continuous IV infusion . Each participant receive treatment first 72 hour hospital stay . Participants answer questionnaire undergo physical examination blood test first 96 hour hospitalization hospital discharge Day 7 , occur first . Participants ask return doctor 60 day follow hospital discharge evaluate response treatment .</detailed_description>
