	<brief_summary>In pilot study propose , plan randomly assign 60 opioid dependent patient new model , Depot-BNT , BNT plus oral naltrexone 6-month trial . This provide initial clinical experience new Depot-BNT treatment model , provide rigorous test whether Depot-BNT produce superior treatment outcome , compare best behavioral platform oral naltrexone ( BNT ) . The follow aim address : Specific Aim # 1 : To test whether Depot-BNT increase retention treatment improve drug use outcome ( urine-confirmed abstinent week ) compare establish model BNT oral naltrexone ( BNT-Oral ) , explore whether Depot-BNT ( v BNT-Oral ) improve key secondary outcome include dysphoria , HIV risk behavior , social functioning .

	<detailed_description>The clinical trial propose provide initial test feasibility efficacy newly adapt version Behavioral Naltrexone Therapy Depot Naltrexone ( Depot-BNT ) . Treatment-seeking opiate-dependent patient admit inpatient detoxification induction onto oral naltrexone . Those successfully induct randomly assign six month trial one two condition : 1 ) Behavioral Naltrexone Therapy Depot Naltrexone ( Depot-BNT ) ( N = 30 ) , first dose depot naltrexone administer prior discharge hospital monthly dos thereafter ; 2 ) Behavioral Naltrexone Therapy previously develop promote compliance daily oral naltrexone ( BNT-Oral ) ( N = 30 ) . All patient group ask attend twice weekly outpatient therapy session six month course . This design provide test whether Depot-BNT produce superior treatment retention drug use outcome comparison establish behavioral platform oral naltrexone , provide experience upon base revision Depot-BNT prior embark upon Stage 2 test .
