	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Combination Melphalan , Bortezomib , Thalidomide Dexamethasone ( MEL-VTD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autologous transplant consider standard treatment many patient multiple myeloma . An autologous transplant procedure stem cell remove patient give back patient follow intensive treatment . Doctors remove healthy stem cell patient 's circulate blood system store patient receives high-dose chemotherapy . The stem cell return patient , produce new blood cell replace cell destroy treatment . The drug usually use transplant melphalan alone 1 2 high dos . In past study conduct UAMS , researcher show chemotherapy treatment regimen call `` VTD '' effective patient multiple myeloma fail previous treatment . VTD combination drug consist VelcadeTM ( also know bortezomib ) , Thalidomide , Dexamethasone . In study , researcher want find use VTD regimen , along high dos melphalan , subject relapse progress previous transplant ( ) give safely subject fail previous transplant ( ) .</detailed_description>
