	<brief_summary>This study do attempt improve remission rate survival time subject high-risk myeloma . It hop give high dos commonly use chemotherapy drug give course closer together ( myeloma come back get bad ) , subject study good outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>UARK 2006-32 Phase II Study Rapidly Recycled High Dose DTPACE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study follow goal : - To find many subject treat high dose DTPACE ( Dexamethasone , Thalidomide , CisPlatin , Adriamycin , Cyclophosphamide , Etoposide . ( HD DTPACE ) protocol complete response near complete response last 6 month longer . - In subject achieve response , find long response last . - To learn side effect treatment . Up 75 subject , male female , age 18 old , regardless race ethnicity , participate study UAMS . The treatment study divide 3 part - High dose DTPACE stem cell collection already sufficient stem cell store . - High dose DTPACE stem cell re-infusion . - Velcade , Thalidomide , Dexamethasone ( sometimes know VTD ) Maintenance therapy .</detailed_description>
