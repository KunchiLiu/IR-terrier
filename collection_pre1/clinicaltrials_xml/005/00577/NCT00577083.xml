	<brief_summary>This test thin , black , flexible tube light system end pass anus , rectum , order examine large bowel intestine , also call colon . Colonoscopy good test examine colon polyp ( warty growth turn cancer ) , perfect . In fact , 30 % polyps 5 mm ( 1/5 inch ) size miss colonoscopy hide behind folds bend colon . This research study do determine perform colonoscopy cap tip colonoscope reduce miss rate polyp . A cap clear plastic hood fit tip colonoscope stick 1/3 inch . During colonoscopy , cap press fold ridge order flatten , line side easily see . This may reduce miss rate colon polyp .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cap-fitted Colonoscopy : Randomized , Tandem Colonoscopy Study Adenoma Miss Rates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient undergo tandem colonoscopy day use propofol sedation . Patients undergo one colonoscopy without cap second colonoscopy cap . We endeavor keep total examination time equal group approximately six minute . The order patient receive two colonoscopy ( i.e . cap without cap first ) randomize . Any polyp detect first colonoscopy removed procedure . During withdrawal phase , time examination measure stopwatch , stopwatch stop time polyp locate restart polyp remove retrieve . The stopwatch also stop suction fluid wash debris colon surface . Any polyp detect remove first colonoscopy count detection procedure . During second colonoscopy , polyp also remove detect . Any polyp identify remove second procedure count miss first procedure . All polyps send separately pathologic evaluation . The time require remove retrieve polyp without cap measure use stopwatch secondary end point . The primary end point miss rate colonoscopy cap colonoscopy without cap .</detailed_description>
