	<brief_title>Transit Time Bacterial Overgrowth Using SmartPill Capsule</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Small bowel bacterial overgrowth ( SBBO ) , increasingly recognize malabsorptive condition cause excessive growth bacteria small bowel , result spectrum symptoms diarrhea , bloat abdominal discomfort weight loss . Multiple factor internal external individual prevent excessive small bowel bacterial colonization determine type bacteria present . The important factor within individual normal small bowel motility , prevents attachment ingest organism , gastric acid , destroy many organism reach small intestine . The determination small bowel motility problematic due limitation test available ( e.g. , hydrogen breath test , scintigraphy manometry ) . The SmartPill capsule recently develop novel device , follow ingestion , measure pH , pressure temperature move gastrointestinal tract . These recording use measure gastrointestinal transit , potentially , aspects gastrointestinal motility/function . Previous study use device demonstrate ability SmartPill measure gastric residence time use duration acidic pH record good correlation gastric residence time SmartPill capsule conventional gastric empty scintigraphy .</detailed_description>
