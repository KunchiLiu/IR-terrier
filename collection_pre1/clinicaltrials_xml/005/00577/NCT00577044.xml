	<brief_summary>The true incidence prevalence NAFLD Hong Kong determine . The natural history NAFLD well define partly difference exclusion limit alcohol require histological criterion study . NAFLD previously believe benign non-progressive condition , since determine subset patient progress cirrhosis even hepatocellular carcinoma . In fact recent histological review NAFLD , fibrosis liver cirrhosis present 15-50 % patient index liver biopsy . The presence obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus strong predictor fibrosis . These risk factor also common patient cryptogenic cirrhosis . Further evidence link diabetes , obesity NAFLD mainly field liver transplantation . In patient underwent liver transplantation cryptogenic liver cirrhosis , NAFLD recuured quarter hepatic allograft . The patient recurrent NAFLD likely diabetic high body mass index ( BMI ) time recurrent NAFLD . This suggest NAFLD may significant role pathogenesis crytogenic cirrhosis . Although NAFLD initially describe slowly progressive disease , emerge data show progress rapidly . Liver failure even describe patient NAFLD bariatric surgery , recent report describe 5 case subacute liver failure obese middle age female NAFLD related cirrhosis . NAFLD also affect progression disease well . Hepatic steatosis relate visceral obesity major independent risk factor fibrogenesis relate chronic HCV hepatitis . However , prevalence NAFLD interaction chronic HBV , , uncertain . This study aim determine prevalence NAFLD patient unknown cause hepatitis determine histological fibrosis inflammation chronic HBV patient NAFLD .</brief_summary>
