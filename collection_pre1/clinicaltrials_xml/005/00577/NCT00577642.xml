	<brief_summary>The purpose research study define time molecule participant bone call NTX begin rise receive treatment bisphosphonates . NTX measure urine determine rate bone breakdown . Tracking marker may help identify optimal dose schedule bisphosphonate therapy . Bisphosphonate drug like zoledronic acid , use study , use reduce pain bone fracture people multiple myeloma . There laboratory data suggest may work myeloma . Participants already undergone bisphosphonate therapy may receive zoledronic acid treatment . Typically agent continue indefinitely . Due concern long-term side effect look alternate strategy reduce frequency agent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Each participant receive single dose zoledronic acid intravenously screen procedure . - Participants return clinic every month 6 month follow test procedure perform : Medical history update ; physical exam ; ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) Performance Status ; blood test ; urine test . - After 6 month end study visit , follow procedure take place : medical history update ; bone marrow aspirate biopsy ; skeletal survey .</detailed_description>
