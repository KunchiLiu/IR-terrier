	<brief_summary>The purpose study try improve odds cancer may cure . Pemetrexed cisplatin traditional chemotherapy drug show help patient non-small cell lung cancer . Many different type cancer cell , include type lung cancer , protein surface call epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . Stimulation receptor result growth cancer cell progression cancer . In addition , cancer EGFR mutation ( specific abnormality genetic code EGFR ) . Erlotinib ( TarcevaTM ) new drug show benefit patient lung cancer contain EGFR mutation . Erlotinib work block receptor deprive cancer cell message grow multiply . In research study , plan combine erlotinib traditional chemotherapy drug see combination work well chemotherapy alone . The main purpose research find good bad effect combination 3 drug ( pemetrexed , cisplatin erlotinib ) give patient early stage non-small cell lung cancer surgery . A secondary purpose find good bad effect occur erlotinib give patient surgery 2 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Chemotherapy Patients With Stage IB-IIIA NSCLC With EGFR Mutations ( ECON )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy surgery combination represent standard care patient resectable stage IB-IIIA NSCLC . However , 5-year survival continue disappoint despite standard care . This study incorporate target therapy epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) part multimodality strategy stage IB-IIIA resectable NSCLC tumor know EGFR activate mutation . The rationale include patient EGFR mutation base recent data report patient advanced NSCLC whose tumor harbor EGFR activate mutation objective response rate 71 % gefitinib compare 1 % objective response rate patient EGFR wild-type tumor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologic confirmation NSCLC Patients must previously untreated stage IBIIIA NSCLC ( T13N02M0 ) Patients must lung cancer document EGFR activate mutation ( exon 19 deletion , L858R , L861Q ) Patients must candidate resection curative intent Measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record CT ) Age great equal 18 year Karnofsky performance status great equal 70 % Normal marrow function : leukocyte great equal 3,000/μl , absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/μl , platelet great equal 100,000/μl , hemoglobin great equal 9 gm/dl Adequate renal function , creatinine le equal 1.3 mg/dl calculate creatinine clearance great equal 60ml/min Cockroft Gault equation use parameter age , weight ( kg ) , baseline serum creatinine ( mg/dl ) Adequate hepatic function : Total bilirubin within normal limit , AST &lt; 1.5 X UNL , alkaline phosphatase &lt; 1.5 X UNL Women childbearing age must negative urine blood pregnancy test Men woman childbearing potential must willing consent use effective contraception treatment least 3 month thereafter Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Prior chemotherapy radiation therapy , exception chemotherapy nononcologic condition ( ie , methotrexate treatment rheumatoid arthritis ) Prior treatment gefitinib , erlotinib , drug target EGFR Patients must receive investigational agent Any evidence interstitial lung disease ( patient chronic stable radiographic change asymptomatic need exclude ) Patients report hear deficit baseline , even require hear aid intervention , interfere activity daily life ( CTCAE grade 2 high ) Peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1 Known HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction study drug . Other serious illness medical condition include unstable cardiac disease require treatment , history significant neurologic psychiatric disorder ( include psychotic disorder , dementia , seizure ) , active uncontrolled infection Women pregnant breastfeed Psychiatric illness social situation would limit compliance study requirement</criteria>
