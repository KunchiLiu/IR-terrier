	<detailed_description>Traditional `` grow rod '' construct spinal instrumentation treat severe scoliosis young child require return operating room every six nine month skeletal maturity . The Shilla system allow spinal growth few surgical procedure necessary lengthening . This major advantage exist growth permit system allow surgery perform young age well deformity correction without concern repeat surgery .</detailed_description>
