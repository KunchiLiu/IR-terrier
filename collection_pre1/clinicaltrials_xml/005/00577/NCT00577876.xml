	<brief_summary>For patient Prostate Cancer advance medical technology enable u identify `` accessory '' ( additional ) pudendal artery ( call APA ) perform laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( scope video camera use surgery ) . APAs run near prostate gland identify approximately 1 3 4 patient . However , large APAs , like one look study , identify 15-18 % patient . These artery preserve 80 % time , depend size location.With study , plan evaluate whether APAs supply blood penis male erection , well amount supply .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Functional Significance Accessory Pudendal Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall , approximately 50 % patient become impotent ( inability achieve maintain erect penis ; also call erectile dysfunction ) radical prostatectomy ( removal prostate ) . It already know postoperative ( surgery ) erectile dysfunction depend solely preservation nerve go penis , also preservation artery bring blood penis . Although , presence frequency APAs study , ability preserve also note , still know much artery contribute male 's erection . With study , plan evaluate whether APAs supply blood penis male erection , well amount supply . While immediate benefit participate study , finding help understand APA 's importance preserving surgery . The primary aim study determine proportion men APAs APAs contribute penile blood flow . The secondary aim describe peak systolic , diastolic resistive index velocity dorsal artery penis clamp APA .</detailed_description>
