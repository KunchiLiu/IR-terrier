	<brief_summary>Concurrent dependence cocaine occur 50 % one million opiate dependent patient spite methadone maintenance treatment highly effective opiate dependence excellent treatment retention . Cocaine dependence remain largely unresponsive medication outside methadone program . We initial data open-label study levetiracetam show medication well tolerate may reduce cocaine use cocaine-abusing methadone treat population . The specific aim study evaluate efficacy levetiracetam 3 grams/day modify cocaine-using behavior , reduce cocaine crave attenuate cocaine 's reinforcing effect among methadone-maintained patient . The primary outcome reduction cocaine use assess self-report thrice-weekly urinalysis .

	<detailed_description>This 17-week double-blind , placebo control randomize pilot clinical trial provide treatment 40 cocaine-dependent opioid dependent patient . Participants , age 18-65 year , randomize receive levetiracetam 3000 mg/day placebo concurrently receive treatment methadone . Baseline cocaine use determine first week treatment participation . ( Gossop et al. , 1997 ) The study design three overlap phase summarize : 1 ) A one week methadone fix induction ( week 1 ) flexible methadone stabilization phase ( week 2-13 ) ; 2 ) 12-week `` treatment '' phase ( week 2-13 ) , consist slow titration stabilization study medication ; 3 ) four week `` taper , detoxification transfer '' phase ( week 13-17 ) . During first week induction onto methadone , participant administer increase dos methadone start 30 mg daily increase 60 mg daily end first week . This methadone dose adjust stabilization opiate withdrawal symptom use flexible dose 40 mg 150 mg week 2 12 . This range find adequate vast majority patient receive methadone program design accommodate participant may able tolerate high maintenance dos may still experience withdrawal symptom , respectively . We may increase decrease amount case-by-case basis base physician assessment self-reported observe symptom . Starting week 2 subject start study medication one two randomly assign experimental group : levetiracetam 3000 mg /day ( active medication ) placebo ( inactive medication ) . Concurrent stabilization methadone , levetiracetam increase 500mg/day week 2 dose slowly titrate total 3000mg/day maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Subjects remain full dosage week 13 . At end week 13 , participant undergo detoxification methadone 4-week period ( week 13-17 ) discontinuation levetiracetam concurrent 2-week period . All participant receive weekly 1-hour individual psychotherapy ( Cognitive Behavioral Treatment ) experience clinician specifically train deliver therapy receive ongoing supervision . The primary outcome reduction cocaine use , assess self-report thrice-weekly urinalysis . Secondary outcome include week treatment ( retention ) , report medication side effect ( medication tolerability ) , change measure : cocaine craving , anxiety symptom opiate withdrawal symptom .
