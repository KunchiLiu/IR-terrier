	<brief_title>Ruptured Aorta-iliac Aneurysms : Endo v . Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The total death rate rupture aorta-iliac aneurysm around 90 % . A meta-analysis publish Bown et al . 2002 British Journal Surgery find 171 study compile since 1955 operational mortality post conventional surgery 47 % . This figure post-operative mortality seem incompressible since many year spite improvement technique anaesthesia surgery . The endovascular repair asymptomatic aneurysm abdominal aorta prove feasible effective . In study limit selected patient , endovascular repair rupture aorta-iliac aneurysm seem show reduction post-operative mortality average 20 % . However , comparative study ( n=32 ) could highlight significant difference.This justifies multicentric randomize study goal compare Endovascular repair Conventional repair cohort minimum 160 patient carry Ruptured aorta-iliac Aneurysm ( study name : ECAR ) observe CT-scan able profit 2 techniques.The emergency allow randomization patient . The unit randomization week center , one week endovascular treatment alternation one week treatment conventional repair synchronous way unit center study . The first week devote conventional surgery effective opening first center . The principal objective compare mortality 30 day group . The secondary objective compare 2 group : • Morbidity ( cardiac , pulmonary , renal , neurological , digestive ) 30 days.• Duration stay intensive care unit . The principal await result significant reduction mortality endovascular repair compare conventional surgery reduction morbidity .</detailed_description>
