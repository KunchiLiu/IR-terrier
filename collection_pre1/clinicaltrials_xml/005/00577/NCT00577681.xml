	<brief_summary>HIV virus lead acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , disease yet cure . Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) proven effective treatment inhibit replication HIV , allow improve quality life survival . Previous study indicate episodic use ART associate increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . This study determine mechanisms underlie increase CVD risk among people infect HIV , specifically , receive episodic ART .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HIV virus lead AIDS , disease break immune system allow entry life-threatening secondary infection . HIV transmit exchange bodily fluid , primarily sexual intercourse . Using ART treatment , people HIV able delay HIV replication immune system deterioration improve quality life . Data Strategies Management Antiretroviral Therapy ( SMART ) study indicate episodic use ART associate high risk CVD continuous use ART . The reason behind increase risk CVD presence HIV well understood . This study determine mechanisms underlie increase CVD risk among people infect HIV , specifically , receive episodic ART . This ancillary study SMART use relevant data specimen three subsamples SMART participant key subgroup . The three subsamples include participant randomly assign episodic continuous ART , participant previous use ART prior study entry cease ART within 6 month prior study entry , participant experience CVD event two match control case . The subgroup include episodic continuous ART participant take either protease inhibitor ( PI ) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) study entry . This current study use previously collect SMART data . Researchers use data CD4+ count HIV-RNA level prebaseline study visit follow-up study visit occur Months 1 2 , every 2 month Year 1 , every 4 month thereafter SMART study . In addition , study use baseline yearly data provide SMART participant CVD risk factor treatment , include use drug treatment high blood pressure , diabetes history , cholesterol level , smoke history , white blood cell count , height weight measurement . Last , use plasma specimen collect baseline , Month 1 follow-up , final follow-up , researcher compare change lipoprotein particle size number , measure nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy , change inflammatory coagulation marker .</detailed_description>
