	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : 1 . To assess prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) -response ( 50 % decline ) Testosterone Replacement Therapy ( TRT ) men `` intermediate good-risk '' Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer ( CRPC ) . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To assess objective response time-to-progression TRT CRPC . 2 . To assess serial change quality life TRT CRPC subset . 3 . Translational : To study kinetics circulate tumor cell TRT molecular correlate response TRT CRPC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Generally , castration therapy use indefinitely prostate cancer patient tumor seem grow faster testosterone present . Researchers want study effect testosterone patient whose tumor maximum response castration therapy . Researchers want find patient ' disease may better control testosterone replacement therapy . Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . Your complete medical history record review medicine may currently take . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . You blood draw ( 4 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . You chest x-ray , electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) , bone scan , compute tomography ( CT ) scan abdomen pelvis . If study doctor think necessary , may assessment mental status . For assessment , ask question attention span , memory , mood disturbance . It take 25 minute complete . If find eligible take part study , begin receive testosterone enanthate replacement therapy every 2 week injection muscle . Every 2 week , go clinic testosterone injection , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check testosterone level blood . This help study doctor learn dose receive next 2 week . After Week 8 visit , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check testosterone level blood every 4 week rest time study . At Week 8 24 visit , physical exam , include measurement vital sign . You ask side effect may experience . Your disease status evaluate learn response treatment . Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test , repeat imaging scan ( like one screen visit ) evaluate disease . If study doctor think mental status assess , another assessment ( around Week 24 ) like one complete screen visit . You may remain study indefinitely unless disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . If participation end study reason , end-of-study visit . During visit , blood drawn ( 4 teaspoon ) routine test . You ask side effect may experience , disease response treatment evaluate . This investigational study . Testosterone enanthate commercially available . Testosterone replacement therapy FDA approve disease , case , disallow use prostate cancer . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must history histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate . Patients must history response medical surgical castration therapy prostate cancer serum PSA nadir &lt; /= 0.2 ng/ml must know subsequent rise serum PSA level magnitude nadir within first 24 month hormonal therapy . Nadir PSA value follow hormonal therapy combination nonhormonal therapy radical prostatectomy , radiation therapy chemotherapy count towards eligibility . Patients must current evidence progressive castrationresistant disease asymptomatic . Progressive disease define ) radiological evidence progression : increase &gt; 25 % product diameters 30 % maximum diameter measurable lesion ; appearance unequivocally new lesion OR b ) two consecutive rise serum PSA magnitude measure least 2 week apart , level 2 ng/ml . Patients must minimum serum PSA level 1 ng/ml . Patients may palpable disease radiological evidence metastatic disease without follow highrisk feature : lymphangitic lung disease chest Xray CT scan ; bilateral hydronephrosis related prostate cancer , palpable disease prostate , know brain metastasis suspicion impend spinal cord nerve root compression . Patients must document castrate level testosterone ( &lt; /= 50ng/ml ) . For patient medically castrate , luteinizing hormone release hormone analog continue . The purpose simplify harmonize exogenous testosterone therapeutic . Patients antiandrogens discontinued therapy least 4 week ( bicalutamide least 6 week ) , prior initiation testosterone therapy must document progression disease # 3 . Patients must satisfy follow laboratory criterion : serum total bilirubin &lt; 2 * institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) serum aspartate aminotransferase ( AST SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT SGPT ) &lt; /= 2.5 * institutional ULN . The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 03 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Small cell sarcomatoid prostate cancer eligible . No prior chemotherapy CRPC . Patients may receive investigational agent hormonal therapy besides specify study . Uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection define require IV antibiotic day 1 treatment psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Unwilling unable comorbid condition tolerate intramuscular injection testosterone every 2 week . Overt psychosis , mental disability otherwise incompetent give inform consent history noncompliance .</criteria>
