	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine proportion participant metastatic mucosal acral/lentiginous melanoma alive without disease progression two month begin treatment sunitinib . - To determine best overall response rate . Secondary - To determine time progression overall survival . - To correlate c-kit mutational status response therapy . - To evaluate use FDG-PET scanning determine early biologic response therapy . - To assess amplification c-kit status quantitative PCR and/or FISH relate molecular pathway target .</detailed_description>
