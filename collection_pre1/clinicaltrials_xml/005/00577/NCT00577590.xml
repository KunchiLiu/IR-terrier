	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) disease interfere body 's proper production use insulin , hormone need convert sugar usable energy . People T2DM high risk certain cardiovascular disease , include heart disease stroke . Normal treatment T2DM target blood sugar level , reason believe also target blood fat level improve sugar metabolism heart function people T2DM . This study determine effectiveness blood-fat lowering treatment along blood-sugar control treatment improve heart function symptom people T2DM .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Fatty Acid Delivery Heart Metabolism Function Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>T2DM common type diabetes . In T2DM , body properly process sugar , result , excess amount sugar blood . Eventually , high blood sugar level lead heart disease , nerve damage , kidney problem , blindness . Typical T2DM treatment target maintenance blood sugar level . Previous study T2DM indicate people high amount fat blood , body relies heavily fat sugar energy source . This dependence fat energy show negative effect heart function . There reason believe lowering level fat blood enhance ability heart whole body efficiently use fat sugar energy source . This study evaluate effectiveness treatment strategy design reach target level sugar fat blood treat people T2DM . Participation double-blind study last 4 6 month . First , participant undergo medical screen medication adjustment period , expect last 6 month . The medical screening , last 1 hour , involve complete medical history , physical exam , pregnancy test applicable , blood test measure various factor contribute diabetes control . Participants also ask permission store 1 tablespoon blood 10 year use future study concern genetics heart energy metabolism . During medication adjustment period , study physician adjust participant ' medication , offer advice diabetes education nutrition , record side effect medication . For newly diagnose T2DM participant , study physician may recommend medication change assure hemoglobin A1c ( HgA1c ) level le 7.5 % . If participant already achieve level , ask continue present medication also begin take medication metformin 30 day undergo several image study . Next , participants complete routine test evaluate pump function heart , include electrocardiogram ( ECG ) perform exercise , body composition study use dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) test . Each test last 30 90 minute . After qualify test , participant return first two separate imaging day include test . The second imaging day occur end medication period , approximately 2 month first imaging day . The first test whole body metabolism study heart metabolism image study , perform simultaneously . The whole body metabolism study involve injection two tracer metabolism , one glucose one fatty acid . The heart metabolism image study involve positron-emission tomographic ( PET ) scan take picture heart include blood draw . The final imaging test rest echocardiogram ( ECHO ) measure heart function . Following completion first day image test , participant randomly assign one two possible treatment group : Group A B . In addition continue current medication , group begin take metformin daily . Group A also take pill Lovaza daily , Group B take match placebo Lovaza daily . Participants see monthly next 4 month , study medication distribute blood pressure , heart rate , weight , side effect , low extremity swelling , measure . If noticeable increase swelling , study physician may adjust medication dosage . During visit Months 2 4 , blood sample take measure liver organ function HgA1c . At completion 4-month medication treatment , participant undergo repeat imaging test . If need , participant offer opportunity attend one follow-up visit re-establish medication routine .</detailed_description>
