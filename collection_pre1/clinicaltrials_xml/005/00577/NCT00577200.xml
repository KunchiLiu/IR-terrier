	<brief_title>Safety Driving After Minor Surgery With Monitored Anesthesia Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients currently advise refrain drive motor vehicle use public transportation unescorted 24 hour period undergo minor ambulatory surgical procedure monitor anesthesia care ( MAC ) .However , recently introduce short-acting anesthetic may facilitate rapid recovery early return normal daily activity . The propose study compare newer short-acting anesthetic agent ( propofol , benzodiazepine , opioid ) utilize MAC , determine particular pharmacological agent , combination agent , impair drive performance evaluate drive simulator assessment , time discharge ambulatory center minor surgical procedures.The three critical measure drive performance select : weaving , reaction time , number collision . If experimental MAC condition show statistical equivalence discharge baseline , three criterion measure , anesthetic regimen designate `` safe drive '' . If study demonstrate early recovery driving ability , probably complex dangerous activity commonly encounter , begs re-examination post-operative activity restriction impose patient population . Subjects group patient chronic pain undergoing procedure without chronic pain undergoing procedures.Subjects pain issue randomize either 1 ) Midazolam + Sufentanil + Propofol 2 ) Midazolam + Sufentanil . There third group subject control undergoing procedure .</detailed_description>
