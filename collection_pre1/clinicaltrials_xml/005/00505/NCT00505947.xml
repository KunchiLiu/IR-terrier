	<brief_title>Treatment Refractory Diabetic Macular Edema With Infliximab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retinopathy affect average 30 % patient diabetes . Good glycaemic control delay onset progression retinopathy subject type 1 type 2 diabetes . However , incidence retinopathy decline type 1 diabetes last decade , even visual acuity may better preserve . As many 20 % patient type 2 diabetes mellitus already retinopathy time diagnosis diabetes . Diabetic macular edema ( DME ) serious manifestation diabetic retinopathy produce loss central vision . Data Wisconsin Epidemiological Study Diabetic Retinopathy ( WESDR ) estimate 15 year know duration diabetes prevalence DME 20 % patient type 1 diabetes mellitus , 25 % patient type 2 diabetes treat insulin , 14 % patient type 2 diabetes treat insulin . Concerning natural history previous study show 53 % eye DME involve centre macula , lose two three line visual acuity two year period . In addition , Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) , 33 % untreated eye available follow-up 3-year visit , oedema involve centre macula baseline , experience 15 letter decrease visual acuity score . The federal budgetary cost blindness estimate $ 4.1 billion U.S. year 1990 , 97 % cost account working-age adult group . Health care economic burden compound result decline quality life ; thus , true impact society estimate monetary basis alone . Although etiology DME unclear , alter local expression pleiotropic cytokine tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) may play important role pathogenesis . Standard treatment clinically significant DME ( i.e . reduction visual acuity due DME ) consist laser photocoagulation ( two session optimal result ? ) . However , treatment effectively reduce risk vision loss 50 % case . Even among patient achieve initial response recurrence common , require ongoing treatment . Vitreomacular traction vitreous may play role increase retinal vascular permeability . Removal vitreous relief mechanical traction par plana vitrectomy membrane stripping may follow substantial resolution macular edema improvement visual acuity . However , treatment may applicable specific subset eye DME . It also require complex surgical intervention inherent risk , recovery time expense . Other treatment modality pharmacologic therapy oral protein kinase C inhibitor , antibody target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , intravitreal corticosteroid injection , high dos non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent low retinal expression TNF investigation . Infliximab chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody approximate molecular weight 149,100 Dalton . It compose human constant murine variable region . Infliximab bind specifically human tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-a ) association constant 1010 M-1 . Infliximab produce recombinant cell line culture continuous perfusion purify series step include measure inactivate remove virus . Infliximab currently use treatment inflammatory arthritic condition inflammatory disease favorable safety profile . Because limitation current treatment DME , base recent finding indicate infliximab effective therapy cystoid ME associated uveitis , decide ass whether infliximab effective patient diabetes ( type 1 2 ) sight-threatening DME . We find clinically meaningful anatomic functional improvement achieve two infliximab infusion 4 6 eye severe diffuse DME ( i.e . macular thickness &gt; 400 μm ) ; contrast remain 2 eye coexist epiretinal membrane improve . The observed recovery useful vision represent significant clinical result , especially eyes DME refractory laser photocoagulation . Comparable beneficial result obtain patient severe , chronic cystoid ME complicate intermediate uveitis , Adamantiades-Behcet 's disease , adult type vascular pseudotumor . Repeated treatment one diabetic patient produce significant improvement DME , indicate clinical response anti-TNF dosing regimen individualize , also observe patient arthritis , patient uveitic ME . Thus , sustain beneficial effect infliximab DME may require long-term treatment . Infliximab well tolerate patient study conduct site . Results preliminary study suggest central role TNF-mediated pathogenesis mechanism DME . Recent experimental evidence also indicate low-grade subclinical inflammation responsible many signature vascular lesion diabetic retinopathy On hand , study patient arthritis show anti-TNF therapy negatively affect vascular permeability angiogenesis decrease potent angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor , implicate directly pathogenesis DME diabetic retinopathy . Four woman , age 52 76 year , type 2 diabetes danger vision loss due severe DME include prospective , non-comparative case series . They use oral antidiabetic agent 14 20 year , one patient require exogenous insulin therapy last 4 year . Patients free major medical disorder evidence infection . Following full discussion obtain informed consent , 2 infusion infliximab ( 5mg/kg , Remicade , Schering-Plough , Greece ) one month interval , give intravenously 3 hour outpatient set compassionate basis . Additional infusion offer 3 patient . Concomitant medication remain unchanged . Complete ophthalmic examination Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT , Model 3000 , Zeiss , Humphrey Systems ) perform immediately infliximab infusion , well 2 month last infusion . The main outcome measurement best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) macular thickness . The OCT-derived maximum height DME record describe previously detail . The student t-test pair data use compare logarithm minimum angle resolution ( logMAR ) transform BCVA , well macular thickness baseline post-treatment . DME present 7 eye , 6 refractory previous treatment laser photocoagulation . DME classify severe 6 eye ( range macular thickness 420-720 μm ) mild 1 eye ( macular thickness 290 μm vitrectomy ) . A dense epiretinal membrane present 2 eye severe DME . BCVA baseline profoundly impair , range 'hand motion ' 0.1 Snellen chart . At one month first infliximab infusion , macular thickness decrease 5 7 eye [ mean ( SD ) ] 503 ( 171 ) 426 ( 165 ) μm ( p=0.033 ) . The 2 eye coexist epiretinal membrane improve . Two month second infusion , macular thickness regress 330 ( 134 ) μm ( range 170 515 μm , p=0.028 , compare baseline ) . The BCVA increase 5 eye baseline mean Snellen chart 0.03 0.15 ( logMAR 1.42 ( 0.45 ) 0.82 ( 0.27 ) , p=0.01 ) . At 3 month post-baseline third infliximab infusion offer 3 patient least improvement DME . Repeated OCT 2 month reveal decrease macular thickness 3 5 eye , 7 % , 15 % 23 % , respectively . At point patient still severe condition receive fourth infliximab infusion ; remarkably , repeat OCT two month later reveal mark resolution severe DME , BCVA improve count finger baseline 0.2 . Infliximab therapy well tolerate ocular extra-ocular side effect note . In available follow-up range 4 7 month post-treatment , recurrence DME observe 2 5 eye , albeit less severe level . For detailed information safety infliximab please refer summary product characteristic . Active tuberculosis may develop soon initiation treatment infliximab . Before prescribe drug , physician screen patient latent tuberculosis infection active disease . Based , believe administration infliximab may reasonable therapeutic approach diabetic patient danger vision loss due refractory DME . Therefore , control study safety efficacy infliximab treatment DME refractory laser photocoagulation warrant . Because preliminary result ( 27 ) , feel patient participate study grant opportunity receive infliximab , therefore cross-over design propose . A cross-over design would also enhance statistical power study , achieve statistical power few patient . Within study , additional question could address . For example , TNF patient diabetes secrete mainly fat cell involve development insulin resistance decline pancreatic beta-cell function . Previous study examine effect anti-TNF treatment index insulin resistance non-diabetic subject show chronic treatment anti-TNF agent may improve insulin sensitivity human . The research programme involve one country ( Greece ) , include total 26 patient type 1 type 2 diabetes . The planned treatment period 32 week . Patients clinically significant DME ( i.e . BCVA &lt; 0.4 ) refractory least two session laser photocoagulation leak microaneurysms within foveal avascular zone ( FAZ ) make laser photocoagulation unsafe central vision , include study . The study conduct compliance protocol , ICH guideline , Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) applicable regulatory requirement</detailed_description>
