	<brief_summary>Suture reapproximation rectus muscle primary cesarean delivery common practice data . Some Obstetricians believe suture reapproximation rectus muscle increase post-operative pain , may decrease adhesion , yet publish data support refute claim . The purpose study assess effect rectus muscle reapproximation cesarean delivery post-operative pain . We also plan assess impact rectus muscle closure adhesion see repeat cesarean delivery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pain Study Rectus Muscle Closure Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There 1 million cesarean delivery perform annually United States , rate 30.2 % delivery . Data limit regard optimal surgical closure technique minimize adhesion cesarean . Adhesions implicate pelvic pain , infertility , difficult repeat surgery , bowel obstruction . Practice technique regard rectus muscle reapproximation vary widely , data regard impact step pain , data suggest reduction significant adhesion . Given frequency cesarean delivery , small change surgical technique may yield significant benefit . We hope learn 1 ) whether suture reapproximation rectus muscle increase pain , 2 ) degree suture reapproximation rectus muscle alters adhesion study prospective , randomized trial . All patient undergo primary cesarean delivery Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital ( LPCH ) offer study . Once consent , patient randomize one two standardized closure technique cesarean : two-layer uterine closure , peritoneal closure , fascial skin closure , either reapproximation rectus muscle three-interrupted suture , non-closure . Intra-operative post-operative pain management standardize . Subjects undergo pain assessment in-house post-operative day 1 3 , standard post-partum clinic visit 6 week . These assessment require less 5 minute patient 's time . Patients show pain chart , ask rate pain scale 0 10 rest . They stand rate pain . Pain medication usage also assess . The surgeon know group patient randomize . The patient collect data pain score . Primary Endpoint : combine opioid use movement pain score ( Silverman Integrated Assessment-SIA ) 72 post-operative hour . Secondary Endpoint : surgical complication , maternal satisfaction analgesia .</detailed_description>
