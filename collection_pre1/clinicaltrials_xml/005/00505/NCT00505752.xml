	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 , interventional , prospective , multi-center , randomize , assessor-blind , active-comparator , dose-finding study evaluate new investigational long-acting follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) infertile woman undergo assisted reproductive technology ( ART ) procedure ( In vitro fertilization/Intra cytoplasmic sperm injection [ IVF/ICSI ] ) . This study compare 3 dos investigational drug versus currently market drug follitropin alfa ( Gonal-f® revise formulation female [ RFF ] Pen ) regard number fertilize oocyte .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation Long-Acting Follicle Stimulating Hormone Infertile Women Undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technology ( ART )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infertile woman candidate ART prospectively screen enrollment 24 clinical trial site United States Argentina . Enrolled subject start treatment use oral contraceptive ( OCP ) receive Gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) -agonist ( leuprolide acetate ) pituitary desensitization . Once down-regulation achieve , subject randomized 1:1:1:1 ratio begin ovarian stimulation one 3 dos AS900672-Enriched follitropin alfa ( Gonal-f® ) daily injection . Subjects recruit four study arm parallel . Beginning S1 , subject receive either single injection AS900672-Enriched start daily injection follitropin alfa . The subject ' response treatment monitor ovarian ultrasound E2 level . On S6 , subject randomize AS900672-Enriched may begin receive supplemental follitropin alfa 150 IU , accord subject 's ovarian response , subject randomize follitropin alfa 150 IU daily injection continue treatment dose . Recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin ( r-hCG , Ovidrel® ) administer subject meet response criterion risk ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) . Oocyte retrieval occur within 34-38 hour r-hCG administration subject begin luteal phase support use vaginal progesterone ( Crinone® 8 percent Prochieve® 8 percent ) follow day . Fertilization do conventional IVF ICSI . Embryo transfer occur accordance specific requirement subject clinical trial site 's standard practice , exception maximum two embryos cleavage blastocyst stage may transfer . Subjects undergo embryo transfer assessed pregnancy follow-up visit perform 15-20 day post r-hCG administration . Subjects positive pregnancy test undergo confirmatory ultrasound evaluation Day 35 - 42 post r-hCG . Additionally , subject recruit certain trial center participate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sub-study .</detailed_description>
