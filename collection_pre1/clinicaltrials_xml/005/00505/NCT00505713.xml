	<brief_summary>Rexin-G tumor-targeted ( pathotropic disease-seeking ) nanoparticle inject intravenously , seek accumulates cancerous lesion , thus enhance local drug concentration within tumor . The goal adaptive trial design confirm over-all safety Rexin-G determine optimal dose regimen Rexin-G would document significant clinical benefit require support Phase II registration protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Using Rexin-G Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Phase I/II clinical trial incorporates Phase II component evaluate efficacy Rexin-G use adaptive trial design . Each treatment cycle six week : four week treatment two week rest . Unlike standard Phase I protocol , eligible patient may repeat cycle safety data objective tumor response/s record . Continued Rexin-G treatment enable target nanomedicine catch tumor growth , halt disease progression , reduce tumor burden . The treatment strategy achieve tumor control quickly safely possible . The goal adaptive trial design confirm over-all safety Rexin-G determine optimal dose regimen Rexin-G would document significant clinical benefit require support Phase II registration protocol .</detailed_description>
