	<brief_summary>The Environmental Protection Agency recognize organophosphorus pesticide require close regulation continue monitor human health effect ( e.g chlorpyrifos ) phased-out consumer market due special risk pose child . There grow evidence support association pesticide exposure childhood leukemia . Studies pesticides association childhood cancer limit study design , self-reporting lack biological measurement . While several large study California find little evidence association agricultural pesticide use childhood leukemia , result contrast association observe household exposure pesticide . The real association may depend timing exposure , type pesticide , dose pathway exposure . Furthermore , person may susceptible effect specific pesticide due inherited mutation detoxification pathway . We conduct pilot study test hypothesis environmental exposure pesticide pregnancy neonatal period , together genetic susceptibility may lead childhood ALL brain cancer . The study multicenter , case-control study , base collaboration clinical researcher basic science research evaluate risk childhood cancer relation measure level pesticide ( metabolite ) genetic polymorphism . Biomarkers use examine risk chronic low-dose exposure , characterize relationship specific pesticide , childhood cancer genetic susceptibility . Hypothesis : Interaction environmental factor ( pesticide ) maternal child genetic polymorphism may lead childhood cancer .</brief_summary>
