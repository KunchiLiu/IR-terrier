	<brief_title>Effect Rosuvastatin Left Ventricular Remodeling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Chronic heart failure ( HF ) one important public health problem cardiovascular medicine . - Idioatic dilate cardiomyopathy ( CMP ) represent final common expression primary myocardial damage produce variety yet undefined myocardial insult , produce area interstitial perivascular fibrosis , particularly leave ventricle . Chronic HF , include CMP , progressive disease high morbidity mortality , suggest important pathogenic mechanism remain active unmodified present treatment modality . The presence chronic inflammation patient chronic heart failure widely recognize couple persistent immune activation may represent unmodified mechanism . The effect statin therapy lipid well know , recent study suggest beneficial effect statin also may relate anti-inflammatory property . To elucidate issue want study potent new statin Rosuvastatin myocardial function remodel relation inflammatory marker patient IDCM . As hyperlipidemia involve pathogenesis IDCM , oppose HF secondary CAD , study also interest approach separate lipid lower effect medication HF .</detailed_description>
