	<brief_summary>The propose study determine impact provide complete information prenatal test chromosomal disorder racially/ethnically sociodemographically diverse woman age allow make informed choice regard test - - undergo . Specifically , propose update validate prenatal test decision-assisting tool ( `` PT Tool '' ) incorporate new screening option make accessible low literacy culturally diverse population . We conduct randomize controlled trial comparing effect `` informed free choice '' approach consist provide complete information regard access prenatal testing option usual care among diverse population pregnant woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expanded Prenatal Testing Options Informed Choice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our primary goal generate evidence need determine whether clinician consider alternative current practice use risk-based threshold invasive test would allow woman make informed choice reflective value preference . A second goal expand PT Tool include new screen test modify clinical use lower literacy population , pregnant woman diverse background accurate unbiased information complex array test option , thereby minimize barrier disparity inform choice . Specific Aim 1 ) Determine test strategy select racially/ethnically , socioeconomically , age-diverse group pregnant woman receive complete information test option option available compare woman receive usual care . Specific Aim 2 ) Update English-language version PT Tool create Spanish-language version include up-to-date information new forthcoming prenatal screening option modify use clinic woman vary literacy level . Specific Aim 3 ) Assess impact receive complete information test option option available knowledge , risk comprehension , decisional conflict compare usual care . We perform open , parallel-comparison randomized clinical trial `` informed free choice '' approach prenatal test usual care 1200 woman present prenatal care 20 gestational week . 600 woman randomize usual care , control group , receive intervention beyond baseline pre-randomization interview follow-up telephone interview . The 600 woman randomize `` informed free choice , '' instruct view update PT Tool tell whatever test would like ( include test ) test cover insurance pay study . They also participate follow-up telephone interview . Revised clinicaltrials.gov protocol . The original study design propose funded era guideline American College Obstetricians Gynecologists ( ACOG ) regard access prenatal testing differ maternal age stratum ( less 35 year age delivery versus 35 year old ) . Our original primary hypothesis posit effect IFC would increase invasive test use among woman le 35 year old decrease invasive test use among woman 35 year old . The thought underlying hypothesis young woman , traditionally inform option , insurance coverage procedure consistently available , would increase overall invasive test use informational financial barrier remove context study . On hand , woman 35 year old , offer invasive diagnostic testing consider routine , would become informed risk benefit screen invasive diagnostic testing , would less likely default invasive testing . The original sample size estimate N=1200 woman . After begin enrol woman study new ACOG guideline issue , prenatal test decision support guide create out-of-date respect array available prenatal screening diagnostic test restriction invasive test use base upon maternal age . We therefore decide end original trial ( N=381 ) . We completely revise decision support guide describe new screening option well represent current policy landscape . We also reformulate primary hypothesis eliminate age dichotomy , initiate new randomize trial use revise decision support guide complete within time budgetary constraint initially fund project . Our primary hypothesis woman randomize informed free choice would undergo invasive prenatal diagnostic test low rate woman randomize usual care group , regardless maternal age . Given restriction access test base upon maternal age eliminate , hypothesize woman age randomize informed free choice would lower invasive test use rate compare woman randomize usual care . In study trend use invasive diagnostic testing among woman deliver integrated health care system California , find number amniocentesis CVS procedure perform percentage total number delivery 2006 12.1 % ( Norton ref ) . Assuming N=1200-381=819 participant new trial , 80 % power , two-tailed alpha equal 0.05 , 90 % retention follow-up , 12.1 % invasive test use rate within usual care group , design capable detect group difference correspond invasive test use rate â‰¤6.2 % informed free choice group ( OR=2.10 , 'small-medium ' effect size ) . We also hypothesize compare usual care , woman inform free choice would increase test knowledge risk comprehension well reduce decisional conflict , regret , pregnancy worry ; design capable minimum detectable group difference equal d=0.21 standard deviation , consider 'small ' effect size .</detailed_description>
