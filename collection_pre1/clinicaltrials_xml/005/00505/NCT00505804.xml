	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether dexmedetomidine effective medication haloperidol treatment agitation delirium patient receive mechanical ventilation intensive care unit . Haloperidol medication conventionally use purpose . The investigator study patient recover illness point , agitation delirium , would longer require mechanical ventilation . The investigator hypothesize patient receive dexmedetomidine able discontinue mechanical ventilation earlier receive haloperidol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Dexmedetomidine Haloperidol Patients With Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) -Associated Agitation Delirium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 80 % patient undergoing intensive care delirium . Early ICU stay , delirium agitation usually prevent use analgesic sedative drug essentially render patient unconscious . This appropriate context aggressive treatment pathophysiological instability , often require multiple painful procedure . However , underlie pathophysiological problem resolve , patient sometimes remain delirious agitate . This often require ongoing heavy sedation , turn necessitates continue mechanical ventilation , worsen ( temporarily mask ) delirium . Prolonged mechanical ventilation increase risk ventilator associate pneumonia life threaten complication . The drug commonly use treat delirium haloperidol , reduces hallucination unstructured think pattern , also reduce interaction environment . Haloperidol significant side effect , include extrapyramidal reaction ( 1-10 % patient ) , neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( cause 50 % case ) , prolong QT syndrome ( precipitate fatal arrhythmia ) . An ideal sedative agent context would fewer side effect , relieve agitation without cause excessive sedation , easily titrate . An analgesic action might allow less opioid use , also lessen delirium . Early study contexts suggest dexmedetomidine property . The investigator hypothesise patient ICU-associated delirium resolution underlie pathological process receive dexmedetomidine able extubated earlier receive haloperidol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients eligible study , opinion treat clinician , continue require mechanical ventilation degree agitation require high dose sedative medication ( midazolam propofol , commonly use specific sedative unit ) extubation possible . Patients could extubated even delirium agitation correct . This include : Patients receive high dose opioid analgesia ( &gt; 20 m/morphine/day ) Patients shortly return operate theatre Patients undergo repeat invasive procedure , desirable maintain deep sedation . Patients likely require ongoing airway protection control , ventilatory support ( example , spinal patient inadequate vital capacity ) Known allergy haloperidol alpha2 agonist</criteria>
