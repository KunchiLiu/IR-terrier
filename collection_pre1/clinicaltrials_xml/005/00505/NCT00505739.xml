	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To determine antitumor activity Mifepristone ( RU-486 ) patient advanced recurrent endometrioid adenocarcinoma low grade endometrial stromal sarcoma ( LGESS ) . 2 . To evaluate quantitative qualitative toxicity Mifepristone patient population . 3 . To evaluate tissue level effect Mifepristone estrogen progesterone receptor post treatment evaluate marker may reflect effect Mifepristone cancer cell growth . 4 . To evaluate effect agent dose schedule patient 's quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mifepristone Patients With Endometrial Cancer LGESS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mifepristone drug approve use termination pregnancy . It study woman breast ovarian cancer . Before treatment start , patient complete checkup , blood test , CT scan , chest x-ray . Women able child must negative urine pregnancy test . Blood test complete checkup also do within 3 day start course therapy month treatment end . Tumors measure CT scan every 2-3 month end treatment . Patients study take Mifepristone form pill mouth every day . Each course therapy 4 week long . Patients see doctor exam blood test begin 4 week course therapy . The dose Mifepristone may lower patient side effect . Patients complete response ( evidence cancer physical exam x-ray ) continue take Mifepristone 2 year response document . Other patient take Mifepristone long benefit . This investigational study . At least 12 many 37 patient take part study . Patients MD Anderson Cancer Center Gynecologic Oncology Houston , P.A . enrol .</detailed_description>

The primary ( include archive specimen ) recurrent tumor must PR positive . Hormone receptor positivity define PR positivity &gt; /+10 % cell immunohistochemistry . 4 . Prior radiotherapy must complete least 2 week prior initiation Mifepristone patient must recover acute side effect treatment . 5 . Performance status &lt; Zubrod 2 . 6 . Estimated life expectancy least 12 week . 7 . Prior chemotherapy recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer permit . 8 . Patients must measurable disease define presence bidimensionally measurable lesion clearly define margin xray , scan ( CT MRI ) physical exam . 9 . Adequate bone marrow reserve : granulocyte count &gt; 1.5 x 109/L , hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL ( transfusionindependent ) platelets &gt; 100,000 K/UL . 10 . Adequate liver renal function define : total bilirubin value &lt; 1.5 mg/dL ; SGPT &lt; 2x upper limit normal &lt; 5x upper limit normal liver metastasis present ; serum creatinine value &lt; 1.8 mg/dL . All qualify laboratory parameter must determine within one week first treatment . 11 . Patient compliance geographic proximity allow adequate followup . 12 . Signed informed consent . 1 . Patients serous clear cell carcinoma endometrium . 2 . Patients whose tumor know PR negative . 3 . Uncontrolled hypercalcemia . 4 . Patients take phenytoin , phenobarbital carbamazepine . 5 . Known predisposition thromboembolic disorder , investigator 's judgment would put patient unacceptable risk thromboembolic complication . 6 . Patients receive treatment brain metastasis may enrol provide remained stable least 6 month surgery radiation . 7 . Women take estrogen , progestin antiprogestins . Patients take drug must discontinue use least 3 week prior begin treatment Mifepristone . 8 . History malignancy ( except adequately treat nonmelanomatous carcinoma skin cervical carcinoma situ ) unless complete remission therapy disease minimum 5 year . 9 . Use chemotherapy investigational agent within 3 week prior take study drug . 10 . Concurrent serious infection . 11 . Patients serious intercurrent medical illness . 12 . Serious concomitant systemic disorder incompatible study ( discretion investigator ) . 13 . Patients absorption drug likely impair due either concomitant medication prior surgery . 14 .
