	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effectiveness Safety CG5503 ( Tapentadol ) Treatment Chronic Tumor Related Pain Compared With Placebo Morphine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Normally chronic tumor relate pain control subject receive repeat dos opioid analgesic . However , opioid therapy commonly associate side effect nausea , vomit , sedation , constipation , addiction , tolerance , respiratory depression . Tapentadol , newly synthesize drug Prolonged Release ( ER ) formulation , also act centrally act pain reliever dual mode action . The aim trial investigate effectiveness ( level pain control ) safety ( side effect ) Tapentadol Prolonged Release ( ER ) compare tablet active ingredient drug ( placebo ) correspond dose Morphine ( opioid commonly use treat tumor relate pain ) . This trial randomize , double-blind ( neither investigator patient know treatment receive ) , active- placebo-controlled , parallel-group , randomized-withdrawal , multicenter trial . To maintain blind subject re-randomized start maintenance period . To maintain blind tapentadol subject re-randomized start maintenance period . Subjects receive morphine titration period continue maintenance period morphine . The trial include 2 week titration phase start either 45 mg Morphine Sulfate Controlled Release ( CR ) twice daily 100 mg tapentadol ER take twice daily ( bid ) . Based effectiveness side effect participants up-titrate step 50 mg Tapentadol ER 15 mg Morphine Sulfate CR maximal dose 250 mg Tapentadol ER bid 90 mg Morphine Sulfate CR twice daily respectively . If subject meet stabilization criterion end titration phase re-randomized either placebo active treatment continue 4 week last dose level maintenance phase . Assessments pain relief , define responder include pain intensity numeric rating scale ( NRS ) . The Patient Global Impression Change scale ( PGIC ) also use secondary efficacy endpoint . Safety evaluation include monitor adverse event , physical examination , clinical laboratory test . Venous blood sample collect determination serum concentration tapentadol .</detailed_description>
