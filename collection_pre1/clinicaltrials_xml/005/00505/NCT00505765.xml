	<brief_summary>The TURNS NIMH-funded contract evaluation new compound treatment cognitive impairment schizophrenia ( HHSN 27820044 1003C ; P.I . : Steve Marder , M.D. ) . Despite advance safety , tolerability , effectiveness antipsychotic medication treatment schizophrenia , many patient continue plague impairment social work function . Persons schizophrenia commonly show deficit number area cognition include impairment attention , memory , executive functioning ( ability organize one 's behavior ) . Importantly , large body literature show link cognition community function schizophrenia . It believe treatment improve cognitive deficit may lead improvement work social functioning . One approach improve community function patient schizophrenia develop new agent treat cognitive deficit illness . A promising agent call AL-108 . This drug administer nasal spray . Studies animal suggest drug may protect neuron may improve cognition schizophrenia . The current study twelve-week multicenter , double-blind , randomize clinical trial two dose AL-108 ( 5 30 mg/day intranasally ) versus placebo treatment persistent cognitive dysfunction schizophrenia . The study medication add patient ' current atypical antipsychotic medication current injectable first-generation antipsychotic medication . The primary outcome measure consist composite score MATRICS neuropsychological battery . Secondary outcome measure include score symptom , functional outcome , safety measure . Sixty clinically stable patient schizophrenia , draw eight site , participate study . Twenty-five patient enrol UCLA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicenter Study NAP ( AL-108 ) Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background AL-108 intranasal drug product contain NAP , 8 amino-acid peptide ( Asn-Ala-Pro-Val-Ser-Ile-Pro-Gln ; NAPVSIPQ , MW=824.9 ) fragment much large ( approx . 124KD ) Activity-Dependent Neuroprotective Protein ( ADNP ) , participate neurodevelopment neuroprotection . In mouse , ADNP knockouts lethal exhibit CNS dysgenesis . ADNP mediate effect part interaction microtubule . Because large size , ADNP assume penetrate BBB thus use pharmacologically . NAP choose represent epitope associate microtubule interaction neuroprotection . NAP absorb follow IV intranasal administration , show cross BBB . Rationale NAP treatment : tubulin function brain function The cytoskeleton play key role maintain highly asymmetrical shape structural polarity neuron essential neuronal physiology . The cytoskeleton make microfilaments , intermediate filament microtubule . Microfilaments ( 4-9 nm diameter ) make actin monomer function mainly provide mechanical support locomotion cell . Intermediate filament cytoplasmic fiber ~10nm diameter . They provide support framework within cell . Microtubules ( ~24nm diameter ) consist tubulin microtubule associate protein . They function transport nutrient chemical messenger along cell . Neurofibrillary tangle twist bundle neurofibrils form microtubule-associated protein , tau , dissociate microtubule cluster form insoluble mass . Under normal condition tau bind microtubule , stabilize neuronal structure integrity . Hyperphosphorylation tau assume cause formation neurofibrillary tangle . Although neurofibrillary tangle associate cognitive dysfunction Alzheimers disease , increase neurofibrillary pathology also report schizophrenia , potentially consequence antipsychotic medication ( 1 ) . Thus , mechanism underlie microtubular function may relevant schizophrenia well . In association tubulin polymerization microtubule , NAP influence tau dynamic increase ratio non-phosphorylated tau phosphorylated tau , imply dynamic process cellular maintenance microtubular network , essential survival cell . In brain , tubulin framework stabilize recently describe STOP protein ( 2 ) ( aka MAP6 ) . Linkages allelic variation STOP gene report schizophrenia , along alter STOP protein expression brain region ( 3 ) . STOP knockdown mouse show disturbances dopaminergic neurotransmission ( 4 ) along deficit PPI hypermotility partially reverse clozapine ( 5 ) . Thus , neuropathological feature schizophrenia may due , part , abnormal STOP-related stabilization microtubular structure , NAP may stabilize STOP-related abnormal neurophysiological process schizophrenia .</detailed_description>
