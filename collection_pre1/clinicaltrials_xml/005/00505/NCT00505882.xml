	<brief_title>Efficacy Pramlintide Prevention Weight Gain Early Onset Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The autoimmune process along strong genetic-mediated destruction dysfunction pancreatic β-cells main pathogeneses type 1 diabetes . These process cause absolute relative insulin amylin deficiency . For last decade , insulin therapy primary therapy type 1 diabetes . Amylin 37 amino acid peptide hormone co-secreted insulin mostly pancreatic β cell response meal . Amylin several know effect include suppression postprandial glucagon secretion , regulation gastric emptying , reduction food intake . Pramlintide amylin analog recently approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) give meal time adjunct insulin therapy patient type 1 type 2 diabetes fail achieve desire glucose control despite optimal insulin therapy insulin therapy without sulfonylurea agent and/or metformin . Several clinical trial show meal time amylin replacement pramlintide along insulin therapy improve post-prandial hyperglucagonemia , reduce post-prandial glucose excursion . A recent randomize control trial show pramlintaide reduce weight 2kg type 1 type 2 diabetes . The Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) demonstrate intensive diabetes therapy delay onset progression microvascular disease retinopathy , nephropathy neuropathy . The DCCT also show prevalence obesity , define body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 27.8 kg/m2 men ≥ 27.3 kg/m2 woman , 33.1 % intensive treatment group compare 19.1 % conventional treatment group . Intensively treated patient gain average 4.75 kg conventionally treat patient ( P &lt; 0.0001 ) . Weight gain rapid first year therapy . Several mechanism propose explain weight gain associate insulin therapy . These include decreased glycosuria due improve glycemic control , direct lipogenic effect insulin adipose tissue , increase food intake due recurrent mild hypoglycemia . Obesity , especially type 2 diabetes , associate accumulation triglyceride muscle well liver . These think cause insulin resistance diabetic metabolic complication . Sub-analysis DCCT show intensive treatment group , high weight gain correlate high waist hip ratio well higher LDL low HDL level similar see metabolic syndrome . An association weight gain due intensive insulin therapy type 1 diabetes risk coronary artery disease yet determine . However , DCCT show reduction cardiovascular risk factor among intensive treatment group well reduction cardiovascular event . The DCCT evaluate cardiovascular risk base degree obesity within intensive insulin treatment group . The DCCT show intensive insulin therapy group maintain high stimulated C-peptide level conventional group . Preserving β cell function , even modest level activity advantage prevent hypoglycemic episode also reduce incidence retinopathy nephropathy . No study date design analyze effect pramlintide treatment preservation β cell function newly diagnose type 1 diabetic subject . This pilot study evaluate effect pramlintide prevention weight gain effect beta cell function among early onset type 1 diabetes patient . Early onset define diagnosed type 1 diabetes six twelve month prior entry study .</detailed_description>
