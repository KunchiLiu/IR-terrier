	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To evaluate role autologous allogenic stem cell transplantation Campath-1H patient peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) . 2 . To examine impact in-vivo purge Campath -1H pre-autologous stem transplantation patient PTCL . 3 . To evaluate impact soluble CD52 upon in-vivo purge Campath-1H . 4 . To evaluate role Campath -1H treatment minimal residual disease autologous transplantation PTCL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Allogenic Transplantation With Campath-1H T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Campath drug specifically attack type T-cell lymphoma cell . Before study begin , physical exam , include blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine test . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . Bone marrow sample take . To collect bone marrow sample , area hip chest bone numb anaesthetic small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . Patients chest x-ray , EKG ( test measure electrical activity heart ) , test lung function . Patients whose disease affect stomach intestine may biopsies area . Treatment give hospital M. D. Anderson . You need stay hospital 3 4 week . A central venous catheter ( plastic tube ) place large chest vein . The catheter leave place throughout treatment . In order collect stem cell , G-CSF GM-CSF inject skin . This do twice day collection stem cell complete . You receive Campath -1H catheter Days 1 , 2 , 3 , 10 chemotherapy treatment . The stem cell collect start 10 14 day chemotherapy give . The collection process call apheresis . Blood remove body stem cell frozen storage . Stem cell collection take 3 hour . Between 3 5 session may need collect enough stem cell . Sessions do day . After stem cell collect , receive high dose Carmustine 1 hour Day 1 . You receive cytarabine etoposide twice day Days 2 5 melphalan Day 6 . One day finish chemotherapy , stem cell collect earlier infused back 30 minute . G-CSF GM-CSF inject white blood cell count return normal . Blood test ( 1-2 tablespoon ) , urine test , bone marrow sampling , x-rays do need track effect transplant . You transfusion blood platelet need . Blood test ( 1-2 tablespoon ) do daily hospital . You might stay Houston area 2 4 week transplant . After , need return Houston every 3 month first year , every 6 month 5 year . Three month transplant , bone marrow exam test do . If show evidence disease , receive another cycle Campath -1H three time week 4-12 week . Patients take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . The FDA approve drug use study . Their use together study investigational . About 30 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson . Nonmyeloablative Allogeneic Transplantation Campath-1H T-cell Lymphoma : Campath drug specifically attack type T-cell lymphoma cell . In addition , weaken immune system , therefore help prevent rejection donor marrow stem cell . TBI design damage DNA ( genetic material cell ) cancer cell , may kill cancer cell . Cyclophosphamide design interfere multiplication cancer cell , may slow stop growth spread throughout body . This may cause cancer cell die . Fludarabine design make cancer cell less able repair damage DNA . This may increase likelihood cell die . Before study begin , physical exam , include blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) urine test . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . Bone marrow sample take . To collect bone marrow sample , area hip chest bone numb anaesthetic small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . You chest x-ray , CT scan , EKG ( test measure electrical activity heart ) , test lung function . Blood test ( 1-2 tablespoon ) , urine test , bone marrow sampling , x-rays do need track effect transplant . Patients transfusion blood platelet need . Blood test ( 1-2 tablespoon ) do daily hospital . Campath-1 H inject vein . This do 3 day row ( Days 1 3 ) . The drug diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) , acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) hydrocortisone give decrease risk ease side effect . You also receive fludarabine cyclophosphamide daily 3 day . They give start day Campath -1H . All chemotherapy drug give catheter ( plastic tube ) extend large chest vein . The catheter leave place throughout treatment . After completion chemotherapy , receive TBI , later day , blood stem cell donor give catheter . G-CSF GM-CSF , growth factor promote production blood cell , injected skin day neutrophil count recover blood . Tacrolimus infuse vein , start 2 day transplant decrease risk graft-versus-host disease . It change pill discharge hospital . For purpose , methotrexate also give vein Days 1 , 3 , 6 ( Day 11 unrelated donor ) . Treatment give hospital UTMDACC . You need stay hospital 3 4 week . You must stay Houston area 100 day transplant . After , need return Houston every three month first year , every 6 month 5 year blood test ( 1-2 tablespoon ) , urine test , CT scan . Bone marrow aspiration biopsy also perform . Patients take study intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . The FDA approve drug use study . Their use together study investigational . About 30 patient take part study . All enrol UTMDACC .</detailed_description>
