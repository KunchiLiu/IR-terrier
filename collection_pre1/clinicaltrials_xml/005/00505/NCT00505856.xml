	<brief_title>Dermabond Skin Adhesives v Skin Staples Closure Repeat Cesarean Section Skin Incisions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research interested use Dermabond skin adhesive closure repeat cesarean incision . The current standard practice close incision either skin surgical staple suture . We compare use Dermabond vs. use skin surgical staple closure incision . Eightenn-50 year old pregnant patient eligible study . Other inclusion criterion history previous Pfannenstiel ( transverse ) incision evidence infection incision site . Exclusion criterion include previous vertical incision active infection incision site . Patients enrol prenatal appointment Texas Tech OB/GYN clinic , Grand Expectations , Southwest OB/GYN Associates office . They consent faculty , resident , nurse staff . This preliminary study 50 patient ( 25 experimental arm , i.e . Dermabond 25 control group , i.e . surgical skin staple ) .

A data set collect prior randomization include : gravidity , parity , age , BMI ( weight height ) , comorbid diseases ethnic background . At time closure , subcutaneous reapproximation tissue take tension skin . This occur subject . The type suture use suturing technique record . The skin edge close either Dermabond per label direction skin staple , depend randomization . The length incision , type suture use , type stitch use total number layer close also document . The number staple also document . During hospital stay , patient wind examine post operative day one three . At time , wound characteristic document use modify Hollander scale . A digital photograph incision also take . The patient also give patient satisfaction survey wound . The patient see two week post partum six week post partum . The wound characteristic patient satisfaction document use material . Other data collect include incidence wound infection , document wound culture , wound separation rate document need wound pack wound dehiscence .</detailed_description>
