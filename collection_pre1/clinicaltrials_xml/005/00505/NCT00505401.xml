	<brief_summary>The development vaccine HIV/AIDS primary focus structural protein ( Env , Gag ) HIV-1 aim induce sterilize immunity block virus entry . Alternative approach focus new vaccine strategy aim modify virus-host dynamic favouring establishment long-term non-progressing disease status . Such strategy target regulatory protein first express infection essential viral replication , infectivity pathogenesis . Thus , approach may effective preventive therapeutic vaccination strategy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Safety Immunogenicity Vaccine Trial Against HIV/AIDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Being early viral regulatory protein necessary viral gene expression , cell-to-cell virus transmission disease progression , Tat represent key target protein host immune response optimal candidate vaccination strategy . Preclinical study demonstrate vaccination biologically active Tat protein safe , elicits broad specific immune response induces long-term protection infection . Cross-sectional longitudinal study natural infection suggest presence anti-Tat humoral immune response correlate asymptomatic infection slow disease progression presence CD8+ T cell response Tat correlate early virus control humans monkey . Since immunogenic region Tat well conserve among HIV-1 M group , vaccine base Tat may use different geographic area world . This Phase I study direct evaluate safety profile ( primary end-point ) immunogenicity ( secondary end-point ) recombinant HIV-1 Tat vaccine HIV-1 infect adult volunteer mild immune deficiency ( Clinical category A accord CDC ) , CD4+ T cell count 400/mL level plasma viremia &lt; 50,000 copies/mL . Study Design : Randomized , Double Blind , Placebo Controlled , Safety/Immunogenicity Study .</detailed_description>
