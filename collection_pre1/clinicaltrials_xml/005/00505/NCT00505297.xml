	<brief_summary>In order design future disease modify osteoarthritis drug ( DMOAD ) proof concept study , study conduct assess magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measurement cartilage morphology glycosaminoglycan ( GAG ) content relate progression disease subject potentially rapidly progress OA . The subject population select high likelihood rapidly progress OA ( i.e. , rapid joint space narrowing ( JSN ) compare general knee OA population thus , may likely change GAG content and/or cartilage volume . The result study may provide reasonable mean assess DMOAD activity drug development . The non-OA control include determine rate change subject similar age . Ideally , result study identify reliable method delay Gadolinium Enhanced MRI cartilage ( dGEMRIC ) MRI cartilage assessment correlate OA disease progression compare x-ray change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Longitudinal Study Osteoarthritis ( OA ) Disease Progression Measured MRI , dGEMRIC , Radiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study : - Evaluate OA progression evaluate cartilage morphology , cartilage glycosaminoglycan ( GAG ) content , joint space change measure MRI ( 3.0T ) , dGEMRIC index , radiography , respectively use age-matched control subject identify disease relate change . - Identify subject characteristic associate rapidly progress OA . - Identify sensitive efficacy endpoint future DMOAD proof concept ( POC ) study . - Establish time interval future study base MRI endpoint . - Evaluate effect contrast agent MRI cartilage morphology T2 measurements - Define criterion classify cartilage legions/deficits use dGEMRIC T2 measurement . - Collect biofluid sample future validation disease specific biomarkers .</detailed_description>

Anticipated need knee surgery next 2 year OA predominantly lateral tibiofemoral compartment measure PA xray view study knee Intraarticular steroid study joint ( 3 month washout ) , intraarticular hyaluronic acid study joint ( 3 monthwashout ) , doxycycline ( 3 month washout ) , arthroscopy within last 6 month Medial joint space width le 2 mm measure PA view knee xray History joint replacement , intraarticular fracture , osteotomy , arthroplasty , meniscectomy study knee History disease may involve study joint include inflammatory joint disease , crystalline disease , endocrinopathies , metabolic , disease , knee infection study knee , neuropathic disorder , avascular necrosis , Paget 's disease , tumor ( chondrocalcinosis acceptable ; treat thyroid disease acceptable ) Systemic inflammatory disease ( e.g. , Rheumatoid arthritis ) Other pain principal investigator feel distinguish knee pain ( e.g. , lumbar pain , hip pain , trochanteric bursitis ) Musculoskeletal pain may preclude subject remain motionless MRI acquisition Unable undergo MRI exam knee contraindication Unable receive gadopentate contrast agent injection contraindication . A study subject display sign allergic reaction contrast agent withdrawn dGEMRIC part protocol receive subsequent contrast agent injection . The subject may continue complete remainder fo study , include MR morphometry scan , collection blood urine sample biomarker assay , completion study questionnaire . Clinical chemistry laboratory value 2 time upper limit normal Participation clinical trial study past 14 day Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate trial participation may interfere interpretation trial result , judgment investigator , would make subject inappropriate entry trial</criteria>
