	<detailed_description>The annual incidence patient initiate chronic hemodialysis ( HD ) double ( ~100K→~200K ) next decade . Despite several advance , HD mortality rate remain extremely high dramatically change past several year . The United States Renal Data System ( USRDS ) large epidemiological database patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) throughout US , study utilize USRDS similar study emanate large dialysis provider serve benchmark guide care dialysis patient US While database excellent resource test hypothesis , lack concomitant blood sample prevent large-scale clinical trial test hypothesis necessitate biological sample . To overcome limitation , establish ‘ USRDS-like ’ clinical trial large US dialysis provider prospectively acquire research quality demographic data concomitant biological sample test two specific aim : AIM 1 : HD patient profoundly vitamin D deficient , yet ~60 % incident hemodialysis patient US treat active vitamin D. Vitamin D link cardiovascular health , although high serum vitamin D level associate improved survival different setting ( e.g. , cancer , infection ) , large study examine whether baseline vitamin D level associate HD mortality . Measuring serum vitamin D level among HD patient sporadic since utility measurement relate dialysis mortality unclear . Hypothesis : Higher vitamin D level initiation HD associate low risk 90-day 1-year mortality among patient receive vitamin D therapy . AIM 2 : Among diabetic non-HD patient , blood level HbA1c predict cause cardiovascular relate mortality . Diabetes lead cause ESRD US ( ~50 % ESRD patient ) mortality rate diabetic HD ~10-20 % high non-diabetics . Leading Nephrology thought leader regulatory body ( tie reimbursement quality control ) suggest HbA1c level must routinely check diabetic HD patient . Importantly , association HbA1c level all-cause cardiovascular mortality among HD patient unclear ( contrast non-HD data ) , erythropoietin therapy shorten red-cell survival ( common HD patient ) render measurement HbA1c less meaningful . Hypothesis : Elevated HbA1c level ( among diabetic ) initiation HD associate increase 90 day mortality , however , HbA1c measurement perform thereafter , e.g. , 90 day follow initiation HD , associate subsequent 1 year survival . These aim examine prospective cohort study ( incident HD patient live throughout US ( &gt; 1000 center ) detail demographic data update daily , research quality blood sample collect every 3 month initiation chronic HD . We initiate `` USRDS-like '' study overcome one large limitation exist epidemiological dialysis datasets – lack concomitant biological sample nationally representative cohort . The study available data share patient protection measure place .</detailed_description>
