	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Grass Sublingual Tablet Adults ( P05238 AM3 ) ( COMPLETED )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study participant 18 65 year age , either sex , race history grass pollen induce rhinoconjunctivitis without asthma . While receive treatment , participant receive either grass sublingual tablet placebo . Open-label rescue medication hinoconjunctivitis asthma symptom provide . Participants visit study site least 12 visit . A total 10 allergic symptom , 6 rhinoconjunctivitis 4 lung symptom , record daily electronic diary participant . The start end grass pollen season ( GPS ) determine base regional grass pollen count , last 162 day . For region , GPS define first day 3 consecutive record day grass pollen count ≥ 10 grains/m^3 , last day last occurrence 3 consecutive record day grass pollen count ≥ 10 grains/m^3 , inclusively .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must 18 65 year age , either sex , race . Participants must clinical history significant allergic rhinoconjunctivitis grass ( without asthma ) diagnose physician receive treatment disease previous GPS . Participants must positive skin prick test response ( average wheal diameter &gt; =5 mm large saline control 15 20 minute ) Phleum pratense Screening Visit . Participants must positive specific IgE Phleum pratense ( &gt; =IgE Class 2 ) Screening Visit . Participants must FEV1 &gt; =70 % predict value Screening Visit . Participants ' safety laboratory test , vital sign ECG conduct Screening Visit must within normal limit clinically acceptable investigator/sponsor . Participant must willing give write informed consent able adhere dose visit schedule . Female participant childbearing potential must use medically acceptable adequate form birth control . These include : hormonal contraceptive prescribe physician ( oral , hormonal vaginal ring , hormonal implant depot injectable ) ; medically prescribe intrauterine device ; medically prescribe topicallyapplied transdermal contraceptive patch ; doublebarrier method ( eg , condom combination spermicide ) ; vasectomy tubal ligation consider single barrier . Female participant childbearing potential counseled appropriate use birth control study . Female participant currently sexually active must agree consent use one abovementioned method become sexually active participate study . Female participant childbearing potential must negative urine pregnancy test Screening Visit order consider eligible enrollment . Participants clinical history symptomatic seasonal allergic rhinitis and/or asthma , receive regular medication due another allergen potentially overlap GPS . Participants clinical history significant symptomatic perennial allergic rhinitis and/or asthma receive regular medication due allergen subject regularly expose . Participants sufficient preseasonal data observational phase eligible continue treatment phase subject : 1 ) experience increase rhinoconjunctivitis symptom score equal great 4 preseasonal average symptom score least 2 day , 2 ) use allergy rescue medication least 2 day , observational phase Year 1 2008 GPS . Participants receive immunosuppressive treatment within 3 month prior Screening Visit ( except steroid allergic asthma symptom ) . Participants clinical history severe asthma . Participants history anaphylaxis cardiorespiratory symptom . Participants history selfinjectable epinephrine use . Participants history chronic urticaria angioedema . Participants clinical history chronic sinusitis 2 year prior Screening Visit . Participants current severe atopic dermatitis . Female participant breastfeed , pregnant , intend become pregnant . Participatns previous treatment immunotherapy grass pollen allergen allergen within 5 year prior Screening Visit . Participants known history allergy , hypersensitivity intolerance ingredient investigational medicinal product ( except Phleum pratense ) , rescue medication , selfinjectable epinephrine . Participants clinically significant condition situation , condition study , opinion investigator , would interfere study evaluation optimal participation study . Specific example include limited hypertension treat beta blocker , coronary artery disease , arrhythmia , stroke , ocular condition require topical beta blocker , condition require use beta blocker . Participants use investigational drug within 30 day Screening Visit . Participants participate clinical study . Participants family member investigational study staff conduct study . Participants unable meet medication washout requirement list protocol . Participants unlikely able complete trial , reason , likely travel extend period time GPS , opinion investigator compromise data . Participants clinically significant abnormal vital sign laboratory value would preclude participation study . Participants participate study may participate study another investigational site . Participants must randomize study . Participants unable comply use selfinjectable epinephrine . Participants may great risk develop adverse reaction epinephrine administration .</criteria>
