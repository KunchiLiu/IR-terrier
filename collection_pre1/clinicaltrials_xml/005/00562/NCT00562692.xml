	<brief_summary>Brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) useful therapy treat patient heart failure . As many patient also airways disease important determine BNP also positive effect respiratory condition . The role BNP airways disease never study although evidence suggest positive effect . The current study therefore proof concept study demonstrate whether BNP ( nesiritide ) improve heart failure airflow obstruction patient . The investigator look enroll 40 patient heart failure airways disease present hospital emergency department . Patients consent meet entry criterion randomise receive either nesiritide placebo addition standard therapy . They receive bolus study medication follow 4 hour infusion . Before , hourly interval immediately follow infusion follow data collect : - dyspnoea score - respiratory rate - FEV1 ( able perform ) - peak respiratory flow rate ( PEFR , able perform ) - requirement concomitant bronchodilator therapy - urinary GMP At time study period conclusion study patient provide best available therapy condition physician ' discretion .</brief_summary>
