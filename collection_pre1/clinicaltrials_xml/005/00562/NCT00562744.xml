Mock resuscitation scenario show prior study effective improve knowledge , skill , confidence pediatric housestaff . Our objective assess utility training program utilizing human patient simulator infant teach tool pediatric housestaff train resuscitation skill . We hypothesize mock resuscitation exercise perform pediatric housestaff patient simulator result improve performance test scenario compare train standard manikin . We propose randomized trial pediatric resident identical training level three child 's hospital . Participants assign control group intervention group . The control group undertake mock resuscitation scenario standard manikin ; intervention group perform exercise simulator . A test scenario administer end set training scenario frequency time predetermined list critical clinical assessment intervention record . Analysis consist comparison control intervention group success rate time completion clinical assessment intervention .</detailed_description>
