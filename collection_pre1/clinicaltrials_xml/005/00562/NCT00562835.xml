	<detailed_description>SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND . Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) life-threatening form acute hypoxemic respiratory failure develop rapidly ( 12-48 hour ) , set acute severe illness complicate systemic inflammation . Overall mortality ARDS 35-60 % , nonsurvivors die within two week disease development . While regulated inflammatory response critical survival , major predictor poor outcome ARDS patient persistence pulmonary systemic inflammation one week lung injury . Innate treatment-induced downregulation systemic inflammation important resolution ARDS.Failure downregulate production inflammatory mediator ( dysregulated inflammation ) associate maladaptive lung repair inability improve ACM permeability , gas exchange , lung mechanic time . In phase II randomize control trial , Meduri collaborator test hypothesis prolong administration low dose methylprednisolone ( 1mg/Kg/day ) initiate early severe ARDS ( within 72 h diagnosis ) downregulates systemic inflammation lead early resolution pulmonary organ dysfunction reduction duration mechanical ventilation ICU stay . The pre-defined primary end point terminate trial 1-point reduction Lung Injury Score ( LIS ) successful extubation day 7 . The duration treatment 28 day . In intention-to-treat analysis , response two group ( 63 treat 28 control ) clearly diverge day 7 twice proportion treat patient achieve 1-point reduction LIS ( 69.8 % vs. 35.7 % ; P = 0.002 ) breathing without assistance ( 53.9 % vs. 25.0 % ; P = 0.01 ) . Improvement day 7 correlate survival day 7 ( R = 0.41 ; P &lt; 0.001 ) hospital survival ( R = 0.59 ; P &lt; 0.001 ) . Treatment associated reduction duration mechanical ventilation ( 5 vs. 9.5 ; P = 0.002 ) , ICU stay ( 7 vs. 14.5 ; P = 0.007 ) , ICU mortality ( 79.4 % vs. 57.4 % ; P = 0.03 ) . At one year , absolute difference mortality 17 % ( 63.5 % vs. 46.4 % ; P = 0.13 ) . The primary objective trial test effect treatment lung function ; new large trial therefore need evaluate effect methylprednisolone treatment survival . The primary aim propose randomized trial determine low-dose methylprednisolone infusion , compare placebo , reduce cause 28-day mortality . Among patient admit ICU ALI/ARDS , hypothesize methylprednisolone infusion reduce 28-day cause mortality 50 % 33 % ( aggregate data five randomized study ) . SPECIFICS . In patient ARDS , administration prolong methylprednisolone treatment decrease ( comparison placebo ) : - All cause 28-day mortality ( primary variable ) . - Laboratory index systemic inflammation ( i.e. , C-reactive protein , etc. ) . - Physiological laboratory index organ dysfunction . - Duration mechanical ventilation ICU stay . ADDITIONAL SURVIVAL ANALYSIS . - ICU hospital cause mortality , define proportion patient alive group first ICU discharge hospital discharge . All patient ALI/ARDS le 72 hr enrol . EXIT CRITERIA 1 . Development serious complication attributable glucocorticoid therapy . - Gastrointestinal bleeding require transfusion - Perforated viscus - Fungal infection 2 sit 2 . Development life-threatening condition ( i.e . immune thrombocytopenia , vasculitis , etc . ) necessitate glucocorticoid treatment . PROTECTION OF RECRUITED SUBJECTS : PREVENTION OF COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH GLUCOCORTICOID TREATMENT.In conformity ethical principle guide clinical critical care research , protocol incorporates step maximize benefit minimize risk ( i.e. , secondary prevention potential complication associate glucocorticoid treatment ) participant . A. Treatment-induced blunt febrile response . Failed delayed recognition nosocomial infection presence blunt febrile response represent serious threat recovery patient receive prolonged glucocorticoid treatment . In conduct RCT investigate prolonged glucocorticoid treatment , infection surveillance essential minimize bias generate effect undiagnosed infection morbidity/mortality . The study protocol incorporates : 1 . Surveillance bronchoscopic non-bronchoscopic BAL sample 5- 7-day interval intubate patient ( without contraindication ) , 2 . Previously describe systematic diagnostic protocol patient develops : - Change temperature ( fever hypothermia ) , - Increase immature neutrophil count ( ≥ 3 % ) - Unexplained increase minute ventilation ( ≥ 30 % ) - Unexplained worsen organ dysfunction ( increase MODS score ) . The diagnostic protocol include bronchoscopy , abdominal CT scan , change central line wire culture tip catheter , urine blood culture . If bilirubin elevate obtain ultrasound gallbladder . B. Treatment-induced neuromuscular weakness.The combination prolong glucocorticoid administration conjunction neuromuscular block agent may lead prolonged neuromuscular weakness delay weaning . The use neuromuscular block agent strongly discourage trial . C. Treatment-induced downregulation glucocorticoid receptor rebound inflammation premature discontinuation glucocorticoid treatment.Ample experimental clinical literature support concept duration exposure glucocorticoid critical achieve regulation cytokine production demonstrable therapeutic benefit . In experimental ALI , glucocorticoid administration show effective decreasing lung collagen edema formation prolong treatment , premature withdrawal rapidly negate positive effect therapy . In patient unresolving ARDS , premature discontinuation methylprednisolone administration associate physiological deterioration respond favorably reinstitution treatment . Study drug taper slowly time . Since rebound inflammation may occur termination treatment , physician use methylprednisolone restrict completion treatment blind study drug . D. Per o absorption methylprednisolone compromised day extubation . Yates collaborator previously show undetectable methylprednisolone blood level ARDS patient switch IV per o intake drug . Although mechanisms poor GI absorption follow extubation patient ARDS unclear , factor clinically relevant may affect response treatment . Enteral intake study drug postpone day 5 extubation . E. Treatment-induced Hyperglycemia . Hyperglycemia known complication glucocorticoid therapy . An European open randomize clinical trial report surgical patient ICU great 5 day , ICU outcome improve near-normal glucose control maintain insulin therapy . This observation confirm large observational study elderly patient admit general ICU . Practice consensus guideline recommend tight glycemic ( &lt; 150 mg/dl ) control septic ICU patient . Glycemia monitor every 4-to-6 hour insulin infusion use follow recent guidelines- The use insulin control glycemia non-diabetic patient record . CONCOMITANT THERAPY . The following concomitant medication strongly discourage : - Neuromuscular block agent completely avoid , - Etomidate , especially within first 24 hour , - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent . RANDOMIZATION AND STRATIFICATION . Block randomization stratify accord site use , assignment make central randomization center generate randomization list accord algorithm Moses-Oakford ( RND , Genova , Italy ) . The randomization ratio one active treatment versus one placebo ( 1:1 ) , block size 3 , receive methylprednisolone infusion placebo . Patients prospectively stratify prior randomization : - Intubated versus NPPV treat - ARDS versus severe ARDS . The purpose stratification distribute equally arm intubate versus NPPV treat , ARDS versus severe ARDS . ASSIGNMENT OF PATIENTS . A random number generator ( die ) use randomize patient . A dynamic allocation scheme use stratify patient - Initial mode mechanical ventilation equal distribution arm patient invasive noninvasive ventilation , - Severity ARDS base PaO2 : FiO2 response 30 min standardize ventilator set PEEP 10 . Study medication randomly assign number advance . Corticosteroids placebo randomize 1:1:1 basis . The random scheme prepare block three . Each patient 's eligibility enter study establish prior randomization . ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT.Only clinical coordinator possession sequence list treatment assignment center . The patient investigator unaware patient ' treatment assignment . The clinical investigator center assign sequential number enrol patient . Assignments methylprednisolone placebo infusion contain sequentially number , opaque , seal envelope possession recruit investigator center . The recruiting investigator send sealed envelope independent pharmacist charge ( ICU manager ) participant 's name write appropriately sequence envelope . The sign seal envelope open read pharmacist charge separate place . UNBLINDING . The investigator may unblind randomization code specific patient case emergency propose therapy give patient depend identification treatment give . This possibility unlikely discourage , patient usually treat way whether code break . If code break ( open provide sealed envelope ) , investigator must communicate via internet fax letter within two work day Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) state date , time reason break blind code . All envelope return end study . SAMPLE SIZE . The sample size depend magnitude difference mortality consider important . The study design detect absolute difference cause 28-day mortality 17 % , expect mortality 33 % 50 % prolonged methylprednisolone treatment placebo , respectively . A sample size least 400 patient would require clinical trial detect improvement data significance level 0.05 power 0.90 , consider attrition rate 10 % . ANALYSIS . This study analyze intention-to-treat patient receive least 24 hour study drug exclusion criterion recognize study entry .</detailed_description>
