	<brief_summary>This study collect blood plasma white blood cell individual use procedure call apheresis . Apheresis method collect large quantity certain blood component safely collect simple blood draw blood donation process . The blood component use laboratory research study investigate aspect infectious immunologic allergic disease . Patients 7 year age old currently enrol NIH clinical research protocol may participate study . ( Children age 2 6 may participate benefit clinically undergoing apheresis . ) Family member patient normal healthy volunteer also enrol . - For adult child weigh 55 pound . Blood drawn needle place arm vein circulate cell separator machine . The plasma white cell extract , red cell return donor needle arm . The procedure take 1 2 hour . - For child weigh less 55 pound . One unit ( 1 pint ) blood drawn needle place arm vein , similar donate pint whole blood . The red blood cell separate rest blood return donor needle . This procedure require one needlestick take 30 45 minute complete . In circumstance , procedure must repeat one time order obtain large enough quantity plasma cell study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order carry vitro research procedure plasma leukocyte component blood , often necessary obtain large quantity plasma leukocytes safely obtain simple phlebotomy . These component easily safely obtain use apheresis procedure perform Apheresis Clinic Department Transfusion Medicine , Clinical Center . This protocol specifically design conform requirement Apheresis Clinic donor apheresis procedure , protocol research protocol . Patients must first admit another approved clinical research protocol NIAID may apheresis procedure describe protocol . Family member healthy volunteer may undergo apheresis use protocol , without necessity entry protocol .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : In order undergo apheresis procedure , patient admit active clinical research protocols approve ICRS . Relatives normal volunteer may undergo apheresis without first active clinical protocol . Women pregnant normal child study . In order undergo apheresis procedure , minimum , patient , family member control subject must recent history physical examination , well CBC differential count . Appropriate chemistry coagulation study perform clinically indicate . If indicate , pregnancy test may perform . Patients volunteer undergoing apheresis test HIV , HBsAg HCV , test previous year . To eligible apheresis research purpose , child must least 7 year old , weigh 25 kilogram , adequate peripheral access insert needle apheresis , able undergo apheresis without sedation . If child age seven twelve year undergo apheresis , third party otherwise involved protocol ; e.g. , Bioethicist , Patient Advocate , must talk child independently ensure child understands procedure freely agree participate . This protocol alone intend general study patient , adjunct protocol allow apheresis procedure . For patient , follow minimal criterion require undergo procedure : Adequate peripheral venous access ; No need sedation ; Weight great 25 kg ; Hematocrit great 27 % ; Platelet count great 75,000/microL ; For patient , hematological value current ( week procedure ) . Healthy volunteer relatives CBC perform 4 week procedure . In order able undergo procedure , must fulfill : Hemoglobin great 11 g/dL male great 10 g/dL female ; Platelet count great 150,000 microL ; WBC great 3.5 x 10 ( 3 ) /microL ; MCV 80 ; Negative HIV , HCV HBsAg serology past year . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients undergo apheresis procedure cardiovascular instability , severe anemia , inadequate venous access , severe coagulation disorder , pregnant , condition attend physician Apheresis Clinic staff considers contraindication procedure . For child , exclusion criterion include age le 7 year , weigh less 25 kilogram , inadequate peripheral access insert needle apheresis , unable undergo apheresis without sedation .</criteria>
