This include : review medication inhaler device technique , review environmental trigger , generate write action plan . All subject receive peak flow meter instruct use . All subject undergo baseline pulmonary function test one conduct previous six month include flow-volume loop pre post bronchodilator . Subjects demonstrate 12 % improvement FEV1 post bronchodilator also methacholine challenge test ass airway hyperreactivity . A urine sample obtain frozen subsequent NMR spectroscopy . Standard demographic information obtain subject include smoking status , age , education status , weight assess BMI . Subjects successfully complete screen test fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion randomly allocate either active therapy use Internet site , placebo therapy use web-based intervention . Randomization occur use internet base program create EPICORE Centre University Alberta . All subject give individualized access code website address receive brief demonstration website . Following initial log-on website subject 's intervention group asthma profile review daily Certified Asthma Educator ( CAE ) . Patients log-on website within 1 week randomization contact telephone . The intervention group access full version website access CAE expect enter daily symptom , even morning peak flow medication use subject profile . Patients consent log-on despite additional telephone contact deem immediate compliance failure . Otherwise patient ' individual profile evaluate end 12-month period . Non-compliance asthma management program define : 1 . Failure enter information 7 consecutive day patient experience poor asthma control precede 2 week . 2 . Failure enter information 14 consecutive day patent experience good asthma control precede 2 week . This point deem time compliance failure . The internet-based system utilize secure website deliver follow intervention group : 1 ) ongoing patient education , 2 ) regular feedback regard significance symptom , 3 ) regular feedback regard significance peak flow , 4 ) write action plan .
