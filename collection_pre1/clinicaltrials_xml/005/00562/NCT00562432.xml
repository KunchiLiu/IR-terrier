	<brief_summary>The primary goal study assess safety Plexisyl-AF administer direct application cardiac fat pad patient undergo coronary artery bypass grafting . Secondary goal study assess potential response Plexisyl-AF reduce occurrence postoperative atrial fibrillation ass performance electrostimulator device confirm location epicardial fat pad ( nerve ) . The occurrence postoperative atrial fibrillation monitor continuous cardiac monitoring .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Study Demonstrate Safety Feasibility Plexisyl-AF Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ( CABG )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate non-surgical non-destructive approach provide temporary , protective parasympathectomy mean reduce postoperative atrial fibrillation follow cardiac surgery . Applications Plexisyl-AF place cardiac fat pad mean create `` non-destructive '' cardiac denervation . This randomized assessment demonstrate safety Plexisyl-AF patient undergo open heart surgery . Eligible patient submit undergo open-chest CABG . Patients receive Plexisyl-AF , administer via direct application SA nodal AV nodal epicardial fat pad surgical procedure . Patients monitor occurrence atrial fibrillation via use continuous cardiac monitoring period 120 hour follow surgery . Patients return clinic brief follow-up , include electrocardiographic recording , 10 day , 30 day 90 day date surgery .</detailed_description>
