	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Capecitabine may also make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Giving radiation together capecitabine surgery may kill remain tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well give capecitabine together radiation therapy work treat patient nonmetastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Nonmetastatic Breast Cancer After Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine safety feasibility concurrent capecitabine standard external-beam irradiation patient high-risk early stage breast cancer . Secondary - To determine effect concurrent treatment cosmesis wind heal 1 year . - To determine short-term ( 1-year ) risk recurrence breast cancer patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo external-beam radiotherapy daily , 5 day week concurrently receive oral capecitabine twice daily , 5 day week Monday Friday , approximately 6-7 week . After completion study therapy , patient follow approximately 1 week , 1 month , 6 month , 12 month .</detailed_description>
