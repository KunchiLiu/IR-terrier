	<brief_summary>Obesity one lead cause cardiovascular-related disease , include diabetes heart disease . Obesity , specifically abdominal obesity , may cause decreased growth hormone ( GH ) level . It believe GH deficiency may contribute increase cardiovascular risk affect insulin resistance , inflammatory marker , blood cholesterol level . This study determine occurrence GH deficiency abdominal obesity whether GH deficiency associate increase cardiovascular risk beyond traditional risk factor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence Cardiovascular Effects Growth Hormone Deficiency Abdominal Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity associate significant morbidity mortality primary public health concern . Both incidence prevalence obesity increase last several decade , obesity affect estimate 31 % American population . Recent data suggest people abdominal obesity commonly exhibit low level GH , affect body 's growth rate way body use food energy . Low GH level excess abdominal fat link improper functioning cardiovascular system , therefore , may increase one 's risk cardiovascular disease . This study determine prevalence GH deficiency abdominal obesity whether GH deficiency associate increase cardiovascular risk beyond traditional risk factor . Participation observational study last 2 4 week . The study consist two outpatient visit , hold either Massachusetts General Hospital Massachusetts Institute Technology . Visit 1 last 4 hour include physical exam , medical history , blood draw , urine sampling , indirect calorimetry test , growth hormone release hormone ( GHRH ) +Arginine stimulation test . Eligible participant return within next 3 week Visit 2 , last 5 hour . Before second visit , participant ask record food intake 4 day food record . During visit , participant repeat physical exam , urine sampling , blood draw . Participants also undergo oral glucose tolerance test , whole body DEXA scan , abdominal compute tomography ( CT ) scan , carotid ultrasound . Participation study end Visit 2 .</detailed_description>
