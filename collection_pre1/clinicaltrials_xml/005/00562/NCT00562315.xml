	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Anti- [ 18F ] FACBC PET-CT adequately detect local extraprostatic recurrence , lead good characterization disease status restaging patient . This study test compound ( chemical substance ) small amount radioactivity attach . This substance natural tendency go prostate tissue . The substance call [ 18 ] FACBC give form injection vein . After substance reach prostate , scan call PET Positron Emission Tomography , do . This similar CAT scan x-ray . Usually compound call [ 18 ] FDG use PET scan substance eliminate kidney reach prostate . This substance call [ 18 ] FACBC eliminate kidney may allow tumor prostate see well . It sometimes difficult tell growth prostate cancer scan x-ray usually do . Anti- [ 18F ] FACBC PET-CT compare ProstaScint ( In-capromab pendetide ) conventional image prostate cancer . Investigators blind intervention . This study look [ 18 ] FACBC go prostate tissue determine ability detect recurrent prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>STUDY NOW CLOSED recruitment Patients must 18 year age old . Patients originally diagnose localize ( Stage T1c , T2 , T3 ) prostate carcinoma undergone consider definitive therapy localize disease . In case brachytherapy , cryotherapy , external beam radiation , treatment occur least 2 year past eliminate patient socalled `` PSA bump . '' Patient suspicion recurrent prostate carcinoma define : ASTRO criterion three consecutive rise PSA earlier clinically appropriate , and/or nadir + 2.0 radiotherapy , and/or great 0.3 prostatectomy . Ability lie still PET scan Patients must able provide write informed consent . Age less 18 . Greater T3 disease past Prior prostatectomy 2 year since brachytherapy , cryotherapy , external beam radiation therapy . Does meet criterion suspicious PSA elevation Inability lie still PET scan Can provide write informed consent . Bone scan finding characteristic metastatic prostate carcinoma Less 2 month since prior prostate biopsy ( decrease false positive uptake inflammation ) .</criteria>
