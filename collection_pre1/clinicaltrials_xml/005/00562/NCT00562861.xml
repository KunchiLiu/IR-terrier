	<brief_summary>Bipolar depression one least studied depressive illness . The standard practice many doctor use antidepressant medicine , study long-term result medicine . The goal study look effective safe medicine treat bipolar depression take mood stabilizer medicine . The drug study citalopram , also know Celexa . Celexa FDA approve treatment major depression , FDA approve treatment bipolar depression . It , however , standard practice many doctor use antidepressant , like Celexa , treat patient bipolar disorder depression . The drug study three way . We see helps treat depressive symptom . We see drug affect brain use PET fMRI scan . Finally , look possibility may gene could predict person would get good take drug use genetics .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Bipolar Depression : Acute &amp; Prophylactic Efficacy With Citalopram</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The problem interest Depression common serious illness , great personal suffering 10 % risk suicide . There two kind depression , bipolar ( depression alternate mood swing ) unipolar ( `` simple '' depression , major depressive disorder ) . In kind depression , antidepressant commonly use . However , unlike unipolar depression , good deal research support use , little research antidepressant use bipolar disorder . Some study support benefit antidepressant bipolar depression ; i.e. , one depress , antidepressant help patient get good short-term . However , long-term study limit ; available study older antidepressant demonstrate long-term preventive benefit . Some clinician think new generation antidepressant ( like Prozac serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) safer effective old antidepressant . Yet rigorous long-term study new generation antidepressant bipolar disorder . Recent observational study new antidepressant suggest may harmful patient bipolar disorder . Clinicians thus leave quandary . Antidepressants appear effective short term , antidepressant ( especially new generation antidepressant ) continue long-term ? Some study support approach . Importantly , evidence exist antidepressant make many patient bad , depression mania time . This major public health problem , since clinician prescribe antidepressant long-term 80 % patient bipolar disorder . This represent standard treatment , despite limitation available evidence suggestion patient antidepressant use may harmful . This study also look possible biological predictor may reflect individual patient ' likelihood respond specific treatment . How problem study This project one rigorous study new generation antidepressant long-term treatment bipolar disorder . We recruit patient bipolar disorder currently depressive episode take eligible interested take mood stabilizer lithium . Subjects randomly put one two group . The first group receive generic antidepressant , citalopram group receive placebo , sugar pill . Patients closely follow monitor research psychiatrist series safety lab . Subjects MRI PET scan biological predictor section study . The key question : After acute recovery , continue antidepressant ? As limited scientific data , oppose kind clinical experience , clear rationale make decision . Our study seek provide scientific basis make decision . We plan follow subject goal 1 year obtain long-term outcome data approach best . How research advance scientific knowledge human health Since rigorous long-term study new generation antidepressant bipolar disorder , study major advance knowledge . Clinicians evidence base decision , rather simply opinions patient ' preference . In light recent evidence antidepressant potentially harmful patient , study provide information new antidepressant work specifically bipolar patient rather unipolar depression ( also know major depression ) . The biological portion study shed light possible biological factor could show individual may respond specific treatment . This could potentially help doctor decide treatment less likely work individual patient rather use `` hit miss '' type method .</detailed_description>
