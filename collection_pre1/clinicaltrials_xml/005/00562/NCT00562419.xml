	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : CT-322 may stop growth glioblastoma multiforme block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving CT-322 together irinotecan may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase 2 trial study side effect , tolerability , efficacy CT-322 give alone combination irinotecan patient glioblastoma multiforme .</brief_summary>
