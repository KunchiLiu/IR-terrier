	<brief_summary>The prevalence obesity reach epidemic proportion associate development insulin resistance type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) . A unifying theme emerge past year suggest lipid oversupply metabolic organ responsible glucose regulation lead insulin resistance . Fitting , others show increased lipid accumulation within skeletal muscle and/or liver associate impaired glucose uptake . However , underlie mechanism mediate change muscle lipid metabolism yet know . The overall aim project examine metabolic effect experimental weight gain lean overweight individual without genetic predisposition type 2 diabetes . We hypothesise lean subject increase fatty acid oxidation upregulate mitochondrial oxidative capacity muscle follow overfeed protect body weight gain insulin resistance , overweight subject genetic predisposition T2DM defect ability .</brief_summary>
