	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , rituximab alemtuzumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Colony-stimulating factor , GM-CSF , may increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood . Giving monoclonal antibody therapy together GM-CSF may effective treatment early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect give rituximab alemtuzumab together GM-CSF see well work treat patient early-stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess rate complete overall response patient high-risk , early-stage , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) treat alemtuzumab , rituximab , sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) . - To monitor assess toxicity regimen patient clinical evaluation serial monitoring cytomegalovirus antigenemia polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Secondary - To determine overall progression-free survival , time response , time next treatment , duration response patient treat regimen . - To assess correlation individual prognostic marker ( i.e. , 17p- , 11q- , unmutated VH gene , use VH3-21 , ZAP70+ , CD38+ ) clinical outcome . Correlative Studies - To assess response patient use expanded definition response , include minimal residual disease ( MRD ) sensitive flow cytometry patient complete clinical remission . - To assess MRD status respond patient use sensitive flow cytometry molecular assay ( i.e. , spectral karyotype analysis CLL cell ) treatment relapse identify subpopulation could contribute disease resistance relapse . - To detail vivo effect regimen critical aspect immune system CLL . - To determine GM-CSF , β-glucan , CpG7909 increase antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity improve efficacy CLL cell clinical response treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive rituximab IV 30 minute day 3 week 2-5 , alemtuzumab subcutaneously ( SC ) day 3 , 4 , 5 week 1 day 1 , 3 , 5 week 2-5 , sargramostim SC day 1 , 3 , 5 week 1-6 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood sample collection measurement serum cytomegalovirus DNA copy number polymerase chain reaction baseline , weekly treatment , monthly 6 month completion treatment . Patients also undergo bone marrow biopsy aspirate two month 12 month ( complete remission ) . Blood sample collect periodically study evaluation prognostic biomarkers ( i.e. , 11q- , 17p- , unmutated IgVH gene , VH3-21 gene segment use , CD38 ZAP-70 expression ) fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) immunophenotyping flow cytometry . Blood sample collect patient Mayo Clinic Rochester site baseline periodically study immunological correlative study , include minimal residual disease ( respond patient ) . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
