	<brief_summary>We propose investigate structural biochemical brain abnormality depress subject , relationship presence abnormality treatment outcome . We recruit N=20 subject major depression disorder N=20 match normal control . The depressed subject would previously respond adequate trial selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) . These depressed subject treat 4 week SSRI antidepressant adjuvant triiodothyronine ( T3 ) . Structural magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ( 31P-MRSI ) data obtain two time patient ( begin end study ) one time normal control . We measure depress subject number white matter hyperintensities ( WMH ) ; also measure degree change baseline several compound characteristic cellular high-energy phosphate metabolism : phosphocreatine/inorganic phosphate ratio beta-nucleoside triphosphate . We compare severity WMH high-energy phosphate metabolism two group depressed subject ( respond respond thyroid hormone augmentation ) normal control . We hypothesize : 1 . All depressed subject , compare normal control , present low baseline level compound characteristic high-energy phosphate metabolism . 2 . Depressed subject respond T3 augmentation , compare subject respond T3 augmentation , present large increase high-energy phosphate metabolism .</brief_summary>
