	<brief_title>Epoetin Alfa HIV-Associated Neuropathy Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Neurologic AIDS Research Consortium ( NARC ) design carry clinical trial improve therapy HIV induce neurologic disease , neurologic condition associate AIDS virus . Complications HIV dynamically evolve time . In general , neurologic complication typically occur advanced disease stage increase incidence early complication associate AIDS less commonly find due improve preventive therapy . The impact new generation antiretroviral drug , predominantly multi-drug therapy remain see . Several key new drug fail penetrate brain , thus make possible incidence neurologic disease continue increase . NARC develop study base current challenge AIDS epidemic . Erythropoetin ( also know epoetin alfa Procrit ) naturally produce body . Procrit epoetin alfa injectable form synthetic erythropoietin . In trial , scientist evaluate effect epoetin alfa HIV-associated neuropathy measuring change nerve fiber density pain rating . The goal trial determine epoetin alfa increase number nerve fiber skin people HIV-associated neuropathy , improve symptom neuropathy . This study also find Procrit safe well-tolerated treat painful neuropathy associate HIV . After two screen visit , participant randomly assign one two group : group 1 receive Procrit every three week , group 2 receive Procrit every week . Follow-up treatment visit occur week 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 . During visit , participant blood pressure heart rate measure . During several follow-up visit participant ask rate intensity pain use Gracely Pain Scale McGill Pain Questionnaire . Duration trial participant 52 week 1 year .</detailed_description>
