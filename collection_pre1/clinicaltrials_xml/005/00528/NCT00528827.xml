	<brief_title>A Randomized , Double-blinded , Placebo-controlled , Dose-ranging Study Cardene® I.V . Pediatric Subjects With Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children acute hypertensive episode frequently treat market drug adult . Few drug specifically indicate use child severe hypertension . Cardene I.V . widely used child severe hypertension without specific dose recommendation child label . This study design examine pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , safety , efficacy use Cardene I.V . reduce blood pressure ( BP ) child hypertension provide important information guide use pediatric patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Evidence Stage 1 Stage 2 systolic hypertension time screen . Male female subject , age ≥2 ≤16 year . Females meet either follow criterion : Nonchildbearing potential , document : 1. medical history nonmenstruation 2. surgical sterility oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy . * A history tubal ligation evidence sterile sexual partner insufficient evidence nonchildbearing potential . Childbearing potential : provide negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hour administration study drug agree utilize effective contraception remain abstinent entire treatment followup period study . Signed informed consent provide authorized subject representative assent subject , feasible ( base local Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) /ethics panel requirement ) . Subjects seizures , alter state consciousness , chest pain , facial palsy intracranial hemorrhage time screen . Receiving antihypertensive medication within duration specify prior screening . Treatment cimetidine within 10 hour prior dose study drug . Any known suspected allergy nicardipine hydrochloride . A calculated Glomerular Filtration Rate ( GFR ) 30 mL/min/ 1.73 m2 calculate use Schwartz formula associate K value . Known history severe aortic stenosis . Known history severe leave ventricular dysfunction . Known history severely impaired hepatic function portal hypertension . Liver function test ( AST ALT ) result great equal twice upper limit normal . Receiving maintenance hemodialysis screening anticipated require hemodialysis within 12 hour follow initiation treatment study drug . Receiving blood transfusion screening anticipated require blood transfusion within 12 hour follow initiation treatment study drug . Lack appropriate intravenous ( I.V . ) access . Inability tolerate largevolume I.V . infusion . Any condition prior therapy , , opinion investigator , would make subject unsuitable study . Participation phase another clinical research study involve evaluation another investigational drug device within 30 day randomization .</criteria>
