	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate potential change epidermal nerve fiber immunostaining ( ENFI ) sensory nerve function healthy normal volunteer follow single application three different investigational topical Capsaicin Dermal Liquids ( 10 % w/v trans capsaicin ) , comparable control ( propylene glycol ) . In addition , pain tolerability application formulation also assess . Data clinical study may use select formulation clinical evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , control , single-blind , single-center , Phase 1 study twenty normal healthy volunteer . Each subject single 15 minute exposure three topical Capsaicin Dermal Liquids control . Each application site , locate distal proximal anterior medial thigh area , 5.0 Ã— 5.0 cm size . The volume apply 15 mcL per cm2 hence total volume apply 375 mcL . At baseline prior skin punch biopsy Day 7 , QST four application site warm cool detection threshold , assessment mechanical ( sharp pain ) sensation tactile threshold , perform evaluate . This repeat four application site Day 7 Termination Visit .</detailed_description>
