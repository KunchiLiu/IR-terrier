	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : To compare rapid act insulin analogue Apidra regular insulin addition insulin Glargine hospitalize patient term efficacy safety , namely Glycemic control frequency hypoglycemia . Glycemic control , incidence rate hypoglycemia hospitalization shall primary endpoint ; length hospital stay accord short acting insulin use shall secondary endpoint . RESEARCH DESIGN : Randomized , prospective study . METHODS : Inpatient single center study , plan enroll 600 patient type II diabetes admit medical surgical non-ICU service three day longer . Subjects randomize Apidra regular insulin 1:1 fashion . Insulin Glargine give day basal insulin subject . An algorithm determine initial dos insulin dose adjustment follow : Lean subject ( BMI le 25 kg/m2 ) initially receive total 0.4 units/kg/day , overweight subject ( BMI 25-30 kg/m2 ) 0.5 units/kg/day obese subject ( BMI great 30 kg/m2 ) 0.6 units/kg/day . Fifty percent total amount insulin give Glargine 50 % regular insulin Apidra . Supplemental short-acting insulin give hyperglycemia meal . Automated order set shall generate minimize error order entry . Glucose concentration measure meal bedtime , symptomatic . In addition , eight-point blood glucose profile obtain every three day start day 2 . Dose adjustment make keep blood glucose concentration 80 120 mg/dl pre-prandially less than180 mg/dl meal . In addition , HbA1c , lipid profile fast plasma C-peptide obtain . Two day prior anticipated discharge , another HbA1c do . The incidence rate hypoglycemia category shall determine . During hospitalization , average blood glucose measurement time point 8-point blood glucose profile compare ; hospitalization HbA1c shall use . Glycemic control compare group use ANCOVA adjust baseline HbA1c . Hypoglycemic event compare group use logistic Poisson regression ; length stay compare group use survival analysis Mann Whitney U test .</detailed_description>
