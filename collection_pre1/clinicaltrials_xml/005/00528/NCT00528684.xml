	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Oncolytic virus reovirus ( REOLYSIN® ) specifically kill tumor cell leave healthy cell unharmed . PURPOSE : This phase I/II study investigate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) anti-tumor effect intralesional administration REOLYSIN® therapeutic reovirus patient malignant glioma evaluable disease progressive/recurrent despite surgery and/or radiotherapy without chemotherapy . ( The phase I portion study currently enrol patient . )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oncolytic virus , reovirus , viruses specifically destroy cancer cell . Reovirus common virus cause disease , show associate minor flu-like symptom . REOLYSIN® formulation live , replication-competent wild-type reovirus selectively replicate tumor cell , leave healthy cell unharmed . This phase I/II multi-center study follow standard design utilizing therapeutic viral dosage escalation . The phase I portion trial evaluate dose intralesional REOLYSIN titrate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . The objective phase II portion study assess tumor response . The proportion patient survive six month safety REOLYSIN® secondary objective . Each patient enrol study receive single infusion REOLYSIN® 72 hour . Patients remain hospital least 90 hour initiation infusion . Following REOLYSIN® administration , patient follow least 12 week ( Phase I ) least 6 month ( Phase II ) regular evaluation visit ( weekly monthly ) . Evaluations include tumor measurement , serial neurologic exam functional performance status assessment baseline , prior hospital discharge , week 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 24 REOLYSIN® therapy . Changes performance assess use Karnofsky Performance Status scale . Subjects also undergo serial blood sample evaluation viral RNA , hematology biochemistry .</detailed_description>
