	<brief_summary>This phase II study single-arm , two-stage , multicentre study determine clinical activity lapatinib combination pemetrexed patient Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) receive one prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen . There short safety run portion study determine optimal treatment regimen ( OTR ) combination , since two drug previously use together . Approximately 27 patient enrol first stage study sufficient response see additional 27 patient enrolled second stage give overall evaluable patient number 54 . Patients treat pemetrexed plus lapatinib determine OTR disease progression , death withdrawal study treatment reason . Safety efficacy assessment perform patient 6-week interval , well end treatment . Patients withdraw study treatment stable disease assess every 6 week progression . Thereafter , patient follow survival approximately 12-week interval death maximum 5 year last patient enrol , whichever come first .</brief_summary>
