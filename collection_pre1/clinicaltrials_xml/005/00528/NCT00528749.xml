	<detailed_description>Sleep apnea common disorder observe practice sleep medicine responsible morbidity mortality sleep disorder . ( 1 ) Although characterize 40 year ago , sleep apnea recently gain recognition one world 's prevalent undiagnosed disorder . Due associate morbidity mortality , sleep apnea identify major public health concern . Currently , sleep apnea diagnose perform sleep study . This require patient stay overnight sleep laboratory monitor , often inconvenient patient relatively expensive perform . The development device allow simple home monitoring patient assess sleep apnea would significant development field sleep medicine . The differentiation obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) central sleep apnea important aspect diagnose treat OSA . In central apneas/hyponeas , lack airflow due lack respiratory effort . In OSA , effort breathe continue , airflow prevent occluded airway . More recently , subtle obstructive event without define desaturation , characterize increase respiratory effort partially close airway terminate arousal , describe Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome ( UARS ) . UARS lead daytime somnolence due frequent arousal . Although nasal pressure signal use surrogate , definition , distinguish UARS OSA require use esophageal manometry . This syndrome characterized increase upper airway resistance ( IUAR ) define increasingly negative inspiratory esophageal pressure . ( 2 ) To good understand clinical significance esophageal manometry , let u briefly review basic physiology . Taking breath require inspiratory muscle generate sufficient force overcome elastic recoil chest wall lung , frictional lung chest wall tissue resistance , frictional resistance airflow airway . At end inspiration , potential energy store tissue lung chest wall available allow rapid passive exhalation inspiratory muscle cease contraction distend force disappears . All intrathoracic structure subject pressure generate breathing . The esophagus thin wall muscular tube , view pulmonary physiologist , ideally place thoracic cavity lung surface chest wall . Measurement differential pressure change lumen esophagus accurately reflect change intrathoracic pressure . These change intrathoracic pressure turn reflective inspiratory effort become gold standard detect quantify inspiratory effort . Unfortunately , measurement esophageal manometry require placement esophageal catheter via nose mouth . This procedure invasive , time consuming , require specialized training . For reason , esophageal manometry routinely perform sleep study , although perform patient WRAMC sleep lab suspect UARS . Instead esophageal manometry , frequently use method monitor respiratory effort record thoracic cage expansion . In procedure , band place around rib cage abdomen . The change circumference two compartment breathe measure . This procedure yield qualitative change inspiratory volume paradoxical movement rib cage abdomen indicate effort close partially collapse airway . This device impractical self-application patient . Given limitation latter procedure invasive nature esophageal manometry , non-invasive quantitative method measure respiratory effort would significant advancement sleep medicine . Over past five year , investigator Advanced Brain Monitoring , Inc. develop validate Apnea Risk Evaluation System ( ARES ) . This device initially develop provide highly accurate method in-home diagnosis OSA maximize patient comfort ease use . The ARES Unicorder design single site ( forehead ) system acquire oxygen saturation , pulse rate , snore , airflow ( nasal pressure ) , head position/movement . Recently , investigator determine number signal acquire Unicorder could use measure respiration . ( 1 ) Pulsations observe red infrared optical signal use compute oxygen saturation forehead sensor pressure signal appear reflect central venous pressure change . These data term Forehead Venous Pressure/Respiratory Movement ( FVP/RM ) measure . If FVP/RM data prof correlate esophageal manometry data , long seek non-invasive quantitative measurement intrathoracic pressure respiratory effort would available . This would represent significant advancement diagnostic evaluation sleep disorder breathing . To well illustrate forehead venous pressure could reflect intrathoracic pressure , let u review physiology . During inspiration , central venous pressure ( CVP ) decrease , aid return blood heart . Changes pleural intrathoracic pressure due respiration reflect timed change central venous pressure . When recumbent , internal external jugular vein open provide primary cerebral superficial forehead venous return . The communication superior vena cava vein headallows intrathoracic pressure change reflect superficial vein head . In sense , forehead vein offer direct fluid fill catheter thoracic cavity , correct compressive force apply skull , respiratory effort link venous pressure change accurately measure . In summary , current evaluation UARS require esophageal manometry testing , invasive time consume procedure accurate diagnosis . Currently , non-invasive quanitative mean measure intrathoracic pressure change link respiratory effort exists . This study pilot trial new non-invasive method determine intrathoracic pressure . If intrathoracic pressure data device find correlate esophgeal manometry data , could significant implication way UARS diagnose . This technology also potential develop non-invasive mean measure CVP .</detailed_description>
