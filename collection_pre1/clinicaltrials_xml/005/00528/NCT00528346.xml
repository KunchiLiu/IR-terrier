	<brief_title>Treatment Of Chronic Pain Using Real Time fMRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic pain substantial medical economic problem , often unresponsive conventional treatment . In study , scientist seek decrease pain increase control pain use newly-developed brain imaging method train people control brain activation . This first clinical application recently-developed technology allow person watch brain activation second-by-second learn control . It may provide mean train people control chronic pain control brain state . The purpose study evaluate real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) feedback treat chronic pain diagnosis , include fibromyalgia , neuralgia , neuropathy , migraine , complex regional pain syndrome ( CRPS ) /reflex sympathetic dystrophy ( RSD ) . The study also measure impact cognitive training pain control activation area brain involve pain . All participant study receive new form cognitive training control pain . Participants scan use fMRI employ cognitive training strategiesâ€”allowing view brain activity . Some participant see brain activation process participant see similar simulate data come brain . Participation study last 6 month 12 visit include 6 session MRI scanner . Recruitment trial limit person San Francisco Bay area . Participants must able attend session Menlo Park , CA . Participants reimburse travel time within Bay area . Information gain study may help develop potential future treatment chronic pain .</detailed_description>
