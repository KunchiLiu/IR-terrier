	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Photodynamic therapy use drug , HPPH , become active expose certain kind light . When drug active , tumor cell kill . This may effective treatment advance non-small cell lung cancer block air passage . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well photodynamic therapy use HPPH work treat patient advance non-small cell lung cancer block air passage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy Using HPPH Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Blocks Air Passages</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine efficacy photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) use HPPH patient advance obstruct endobronchial non-small cell lung cancer . Secondary - To determine palliation symptom patient treated regimen . - To determine amount HPPH take obstruct endobronchial tumor patient . - To determine extent STAT3 cross-link , molecular marker immediate PDT reaction , obstruct tumor patient PDT treatment . - To determine inflammation apoptosis obstruct bronchial tumor patient PDT treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive HPPH IV 1 hour day 1 . On day 3 , patient undergo photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) comprise laser light deliver flexible , fiberoptic fiber pass biopsy channel endoscope . Patients undergo endoscopic debridement day 5 . If viable tumor find outside initial treatment area , patient may receive another dose laser light without additional HPPH . Patients may undergo tumor biopsy periodically study optional biomarker/correlative study . Tumor tissue sample analyze STAT3 cross-link western blotting ; apoptosis inflammation biomarkers immunohistochemistry , TUNEL , immunological laboratory method ; tumor concentration HPPH fluorescence emission spectroscopy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-6 week periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
