	<brief_summary>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) , also know sickle cell anemia , inherit blood disease cause intense pain episode may lead organ failure . Preliminary study show adult SCD may brain abnormality contribute problem cognitive functioning , include attention memory difficulty . This study use brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) neuropsychological test examine difference cognitive function adult SCD adult without SCD . 212 subject participate cross-sectional study consist screen questionnaire , neuropsychological test battery , MRI test . Enrollment study end May 2008 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examining Cognitive Function Brain Abnormalities Adults With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SCD inherit blood disorder . Symptoms include anemia , infection , organ damage , intense episode pain , call `` sickle cell crisis . '' In past , SCD consider fatal disease , many people SCD die young age . Due advance medical care , people SCD living longer live ; however , often experience deterioration quality life due progressive organ failure . Past research suggest child SCD commonly frontal lobe dysfunction syndrome , brain disorder affect cognitive function area attention , concentration , information processing , decision making . Often time , however , neurocognitive brain disorder diagnose treated people SCD . In preliminary brain imaging study , least half adult participant SCD cognitive dysfunction could see image brain , participant without SCD rarely visible change brain . Brain dysfunction may one important least-studied problem affect adult SCD . The purpose study evaluate extent cognitive functioning problem adults SCD . The study also determine connection cognitive functioning problem abnormality see MRI brain image adults SCD . This study observational case/control study enroll adult SCD control group healthy adult SCD . At study visit Day 1 , participant undergo blood collection complete psychosocial questionnaire . Female participant provide urine sample pregnancy test . Study researcher conduct medical record review , physical exam , neurological exam . They also interview participant collect medical history information . On Day 2 , participant undergo either brain MRI neuropsychological testing ; Day 3 , procedure complete . On Day 4 , study researcher explain study procedure result participant . Participants ask willing take part second phase study future . Enrollment study end May 2008 . A pilot interventional study follow study , report separately ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 00850018 .</detailed_description>
