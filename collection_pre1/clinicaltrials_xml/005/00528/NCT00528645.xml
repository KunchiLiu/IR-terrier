	<brief_title>AZD0530 Treating Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 12-week progression-free survival rate patient extensive stage small cell lung cancer treat AZD0530 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate patient treat drug . II . To determine overall survival time-to-progression patient treat drug . III . To determine adverse event AZD0530 patient IV . To determine effect AZD0530 treatment level circulate tumor cell patient . V. To determine potential predictive marker response circulate tumor cell treatment drug . VI . To evaluate rate tumor marker ( i.e. , circulate tumor cell ) stabilization patient treat drug . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect AZD0530 treatment level circulate tumor cell . II . To determine potential predictive marker response circulate tumor cell treatment drug . III . To evaluate rate tumor marker ( i.e. , circulate tumor cell ) stabilization patient treat drug . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral AZD0530 daily 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample obtain baseline periodically study determine level circulate tumor cell define translational study . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
