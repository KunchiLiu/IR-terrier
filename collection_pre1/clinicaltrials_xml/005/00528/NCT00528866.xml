	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Specialized radiation therapy deliver high-dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , leuprolide , goserelin , flutamide , bicalutamide , may lessen amount androgen make body . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving radiation therapy together androgen suppression docetaxel surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give radiation therapy together androgen suppression docetaxel work treat patient high risk prostate cancer undergone radical prostatectomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess whether addition androgen suppression therapy docetaxel adjuvant radiotherapy improve freedom progression . Secondary - To assess freedom local-regional progression , distant metastasis , disease-free survival , prostate cancer specific survival , non-prostate cancer specific survival , overall survival , time biochemical ( PSA ) failure . - To evaluate treatment-related `` acute '' `` late '' toxicity base Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Effects ( CTCAE ) v3.0 . - To correlate genomic proteomic biomarkers primary secondary clinical endpoint utilize archival prostatectomy tissue pretreatment prospectively collect serum/plasma . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Androgen suppression therapy : Patients receive luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist ( leuprolide goserelin ) injection AND oral antiandrogen ( flutamide 3 time daily bicalutamide daily ) 6 month . - Radiotherapy : Beginning 8 week initiation androgen suppression therapy , patient undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy intensity-modulated radiotherapy day 5 day week approximately 8 week . - Chemotherapy : Beginning 3-6 week completion radiotherapy , patient receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
