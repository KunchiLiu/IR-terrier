	<brief_title>Safety Study PRLX 93936 Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study ass safety , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics PRLX 93936 administer intravenously 1 hr daily 5 day patient advance solid tumor . Patients evaluate prior dosing , dose follow dosing , 28-day cycle . Tumor response evaluate every cycle . Three patient assign per dose level Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) reach Dose-Limited Toxicity ( DLT ) encounter . Sequential cohort three patient treat escalate dos Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) reach .</detailed_description>
