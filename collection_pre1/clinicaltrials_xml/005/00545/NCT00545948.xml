	<brief_summary>This study assign subject either cisplatin/vinorelbine cisplatin/pemetrexed chemotherapy use genomic base expression profile determine chemotherapy sensitivity completely resect early stage non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The vinorelbine-sensitive tumor group receive Vinorelbine follow cisplatin , pemetrexed-sensitive tumor group receive pemetrexed follow cisplatin . The primary objective trial determine whether genomic-based adjuvant chemotherapy treatment increase 2-year progression-free survival rate completely resect patient NSCLC compare historic control . Secondary objective include : 1 ) estimation percentage completely resect NSCLC tumor adequately analyze used direct specific adjuvant chemotherapy ; 2 ) estimation proportion patient assign treatment vinorelbine pemetrexed ; 3 ) evaluation drug sensitivity pattern cisplatin pemetrexed treatment arm ; 4 ) description overall median survival experience treat patient ; 5 ) assessment patient understanding perception participate clinical trial evaluate cancer genomics adjuvant treatment early stage lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Cisplatin With Either Genomic-Guided Vinorelbine Pemetrexed Early Stage Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study multi-center open label phase II study chemotherapy doublet cisplatin/vinorelbine cisplatin/pemetrexed adjuvant therapy early stage non-squamous NSCLC . Eligible patient previous treatment current diagnosis NSCLC . The two treatment group patient determine gene expression profile analysis patient 's tumor : one group vinorelbine-sensitive patient one group pemetrexed-sensitive patient . The genomic expression profile utilized generate percentage likelihood chemotherapy sensitivity . Patients direct receive chemotherapy regimen percentage predict sensitivity high . For instance , model predict likelihood tumor sensitivity 46 % vinorelbine 48 % pemetrexed , adjuvant chemotherapy would direct cisplatin/pemetrexed . Patients whose tumor could adequately analyze gene expression offer adjuvant therapy protocol deem appropriate primary oncologist . Patients either squamous non-squamous cell histology eligible participate study indicate study protocol date prior January 25 , 2010 . An amendment protocol January 25 , 2010 indicated inclusion non-squamous histology . However , low accrual January 25 , 2010 ( 5 patient , include 2 screen failure ) , report reflect original study outcome include squamous non-squamous histology . Thirty-one patient stage IB ( &gt; 4 cm ) , II IIIA non-squamous NSCLC enrol , 24 assign treatment . The vinorelbine-sensitive tumor group receive Vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 day 1 8 , follow cisplatin 75 mg/m2 day 1 , every 21 day 4 cycle . The pemetrexed-sensitive tumor group receive pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 day 1 follow cisplatin 75 mg/m2 day 1 , every 21 day 4 cycle . Standard pre-medication regimen include dexamethasone , vitamin B12 folate supplementation pemetrexed group . Patients group receive maximum 4 cycle therapy . Subsequent reevaluation genomic signature chemotherapy sensitivity show irreproducible , suggest inaccurate patient assignment two treatment arm . As result , would inappropriate separately analyze outcome different treatment group . Instead , information arm combine reflect overall measure two-year progression-free survival study . Similarly secondary objective , arm combine address endpoint . To assess patient understanding perception participate clinical trial evaluate cancer genomics adjuvant treatment early stage lung cancer , patient provide response follow question baseline : 1 . Did doctor talk today choose chemotherapy treatment lung cancer base genomics tumor ? 2 . How well understand doctor tell choose chemotherapy base genomics tumor ? ( circle number 1 7 , 1 = poorly 7 = well ) 3 . Do think type chemotherapy get base genomics tumor ? 4 . Do think get good medical care treatment lung cancer base genomics tumor ? 5 . To extent think treat lung cancer base genomics tumor lead successful treatment strategy ? ( circle number 1 7 , 1 = definitely lead successful treatment 7 = definitely lead successful treatment ) 6 . How effective think chemotherapy stop cancer come back ? ( circle number 1 7 , 1 = effective 7 = completely effective ) 7 . To extent YOUR lung cancer primarily cause genetics ? ( circle number 1 7 , 1 = cause genetics 7 = completely cause genetics ) 8 . To extent think lung cancer treatable ? ( circle number 1 7 , 1 = definitely treatable 7 = definitely treatable ) 9 . Did doctor talk chance lung cancer come back ? ( Yes - go question 10 , No - go question 11 , Do know - go question 11 ) 10 . What doctor say chance cancer come back ? ( Low Risk , Moderate intermediate risk , High risk , Do know ) 11 . What think chance lung cancer come back next year scale 1 7 1=definitely come back 7=definitely come back ? 12 . How worried lung cancer come back next year ? ( circle number 1 7 , 1=not worry 7=extremely worried )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients eligible include study meet follow criterion : 1 . Patients completely resect stage IB ( &gt; 4 cm ) , II , IIIA NonSquamous NSCLC . Patient must enrol begin therapy within 4 12 week date complete surgical resection . 2 . Fresh tissue must available genomics expression profile . 3 . ECOG performance status 0 1 . 4 . NO prior chemotherapy , radiation therapy , biologic/targeted therapy within last 5 year . Prior therapy low dose methotrexate similar medication allow therapy use treat nonmalignant condition . 5 . Age ≥ 18 year . 6 . No previous concomitant malignancy past 5 year curativelytreated carcinoma situ cervix , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . 7 . No serious medical psychiatric illness . 8 . Signed informed consent . 9 . Required laboratory data within one week enrollment : ANC AGC ≥ 1500 per uL ; Platelets ≥ 100,000 per uL ; Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL ; Creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dL ; creatinine clearance ≥ 45 mL/min ; SGOT/SGPT ≤ 1.5x ULN . 10 . Females childbearing potential ( surgically sterilize menarche 1 year post menopause ) must test negative pregnancy within 7 day prior time enrollment base serum pregnancy test . Both sexually active male female reproductive potential must agree use reliable method birth control , determine patient health care team , study 3 month follow last dose study drug . Patients exclude study meet follow criterion : 1 . Treatment within last 30 day drug receive regulatory approval indication time study entry . 2 .
