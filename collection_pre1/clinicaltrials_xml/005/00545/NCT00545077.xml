	<brief_summary>Locally advanced metastatic breast cancer postmenopausal woman negative HER2 , candidate hormone treatment receive previous chemotherapy hormonotherapy metastatic disease . The main endpoint study PFS . It calculate 378 patient need include , accord follow assumption : - Recruitment period 21 month . - Minimum follow-up period 9 month . - PFS 9 month control arm ( letrozole monotherapy ) . Using two-sided log-rank test , 5 % α level , 344 patient ( 172 treatment arm ) require 270 event occur , provide 80 % power detect hazard ratio 0.69 ( correspond PFS median 13 month bevacizumab arm ) . This sample size adjust intermediate analysis 2/3 total required event occur . This intermediate analysis avoid , time must carry , estimate final analysis carry 4 month . Taking account 10 % percentage loss , 378 patient expect include study . An intermediate safety evaluation carry 63 patient finish treatment treatment arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A multicenter , randomize phase III clinical trial . After verify selection criterion , patient randomize receive letrozole alone combination bevacizumab . Before randomization , patient stratify accord follow prognosis factor : - ER+/PgR+ v option ( ER+/PgR- v ER-/PgR+ ) - Previous adjuvant hormonotherapy ( yes/no ) - Status : locally advance vs metastatic . - Measurable v non measurable disease - Visceral disease ( yes/no ) - PFS .</detailed_description>

Functional ECOG status 0 1 . 5 . Life expectancy ≥ 24 week . 6 . Histologically confirm breast adenocarcinoma , measurable nonmeasurable , locally advanced metastatic ( stage IV ) disease . In event patient locally advanced disease , able undergo curative local treatment . Patients metastasis confine bone chosen , disease must confirm radiology , CT scan NMR doubt single bone scan . 7 . Patients HER2negative disease evaluate IHC FISH/CISH ( IHC 0 1+ , 2+ negative FISH ) . Patients 3+ IHC chosen regardless FISH/CISH status positive FISH/CISH ( &gt; 2 amplification ) choose either , regardless IHC finding . 8 . Positive hormone receptor ( estrogen receptor [ ER ] and/or progesterone receptor [ PgR ] ) evaluate local central laboratory , accord criterion participate institution . 9 . Patients candidate receive firstline treatment letrozole . 10 . Patients may receive ( neo ) adjuvant chemotherapy , provide last dose latter receive least 12 month randomization . Patients must recover toxicity . 11 . The patient allow receive adjuvant radiotherapy , provide complete least 6 week randomization patient recover reversible acute effect radiation . The previous administration radiotherapy palliate pain bone metastases authorize , provide : Not 30 % bone marrow irradiate . The patient recover reversible acute effect radiation . The patient least one metastatic location irradiate may evaluate progression , clear progression bone disease objectify end palliative radiotherapy . 12 . The patient may receive kind previous ( neo ) adjuvant hormone therapy provide consider candidate firstline hormonotherapy either letrozole fulvestrant . 13 . The treatment bisphosphonates allow recommended patient bone metastasis . Whenever possible , treatment start within 4 week start study therapy . The patient start treatment bisphosphonates must carefully evaluate mask progression disease . 14 . In patient heart failure risk ( e.g . previously treat &gt; 360mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent dos anthracyclines ) , LVEF must determine mean echocardiogram radionuclide ventriculography ( MUGA ) , must &gt; low limit normal . 1 . Evolutionary disease require immediate treatment cytotoxic chemotherapy accord investigator 's judgment . 2 . Patients locally advance breast cancer expect undergo surgery curative radiotherapy . 3 . Previous chemotherapy hormonotherapy metastatic disease . Patients may receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy neoadjuvant hormonotherapy curative intention part alternative adjuvant treatment . For previous neoadjuvant hormonotherapy premise adjuvant hormonotherapy valid . 4 . Previous therapy antiVEGF VEGFR tyrosinekinase inhibitor . 5 . History another pathology may affect development protocol interpretation result . It consider patient suffer skin carcinoma melanoma , cervical carcinoma situ another neoplasia treat curative intention diseasefree interval exceed 5 year choose . 6 . Evidence CNS metastasis . A CT scan brain NMR must do within 4 week randomization case suspect brain metastasis . 7 .
