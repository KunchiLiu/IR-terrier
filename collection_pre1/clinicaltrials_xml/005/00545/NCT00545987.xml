	<brief_title>Study Potential Preventive Vaccine Against HIV Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 40 million people worldwide currently infect HIV , virus cause AIDS ( Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ) . The number new case continue rise alarm rate .

To date , one three dos ADVAX vaccine give 45 individual study take place December 2003 October 2005 Rockefeller University University Rochester appear safe . The difference ADVAX study previous one receive two dos vaccine placebo either standard intramuscular injection `` electroporation . '' This study part broad research effort see change way vaccine give make vaccine effective . The result study suggest use regular needle may potent way inject type vaccine . This study new method injection call electroporation . Electroporation use device injects substance muscle along small amount electricity . This device use limited extent human subject show effective regular needle safe tested animal . Devices similar use many study deliver chemotherapy directly patient ' tumor .</detailed_description>
