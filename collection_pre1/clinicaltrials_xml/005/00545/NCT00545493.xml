	<brief_summary>Rasmussen encephalitis ( RE ) rare severe chronic inflammatory brain disease unknown origin affect one brain hemisphere . It usually accompany intractable epilepsy . In addition , often lead severe disability due functional deficit cause atrophy one brain hemisphere . Hemispherectomy effective mean surgical treatment epilepsy . It render patient , however , hemiplegic , hemianopic ( language dominant hemisphere affect ) aphasic . To slow even stop progressive inflammatory damage affect brain hemisphere , immunotherapy may beneficial . According literature survey , tacrolimus ( twice daily intake capsule ) intravenous immunoglobulin ( monthly infusion ) promise compound . In investigator ' study , two type treatment randomly assign patient disease onset within last year far advanced disability hemispheric brain injury . The patient follow assess prospectively functional brain MRI course disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Trial design/2 . Trial intervention Patients screen epileptological , neuropediatric , neurological center Germany . The study design approve meeting Bonn April 20 , 2002 several external participant ethical committee University Bonn . Patients suspect diagnosis RE transfer Department Epileptology University Bonn . If diagnosis `` RE acute stage '' confirm patient ( child ) parent give informed consent , patient randomize one two active treatment arm . The study start 1.10.2002 . The first patient include 20.11.2002 . 3 . Inclusion/exclusion criterion See appropriate section 4 . Duration Recruitment start 1.10.2002 go propose number study participant include . A patient remain study reach one predefined exit parameter ( see , # 4.5 ) . Every patient follow study condition least 12 month ( obtain true long term result ) . 5 . Outcome measure See appropriate section . 6 . Methods bias The patient randomize one treatment arm . To avoid unbalanced group size unequal number adolescent adult , two randomization list , one patient &lt; 11 year , one old patient ( stratification ) . Blinding possible administration two drug different would necessitate additional use placebo capsule IVIG group placebo infusion tacrolimus group . Because production administration adequate `` IVIG-placebo '' highly impracticable , blind treatment application plan . The physician assess `` Motricity Index '' `` Hemispheric ratio '' unaware kind treatment use . 7 . Power calculation It assume 1-2 RE patient diagnose large epilepsy center per year . The cooperation study center specialize center Germany good . Therefore , expect majority RE case transfer department . We estimate 16 suitable patient include within propose inclusion period . The disease rare perform power calculation ( mainly use limit recruitment figure ) . RE orphan disease , even number participant suffice detect small moderate difference two treatment , result provide invaluable information conservative treatment condition , e.g . comparison historical untreated control . 8 . Number participant It intend include least 16 patient name period ( otherwise , recruitment period prolong ) . We perform intention treat analysis analysis patient treat per protocol . 9 . Trial site Potential study participant refer department ( Dept . Epileptology , University Bonn ) Germany . The study procedure , especially clinical neuroradiological follow-up study include assessment safety parameter perform Bonn ( visit every two month within first year , second year every four month , thereafter every six month ) . In interval visit Bonn , refer center participate monitoring patient administration IVIG . There continuous contact study center Bonn external study co-worker . 10 . Analyses Primary outcome parameter ( time exit ) : The two group compare log rank test ( Kaplan-Meyer-survival curve ) . Non-parametric test apply secondary outcome parameter . 11 . Ethical consideration Tacrolimus IVIG side effect . The known tacrolimus side effect severe frequent IVIG . It must note , however , know tacrolimus side effect assess organ transplant patient severe medical disease usually treat one immunosuppressant . In patient autoimmune disorder treat tacrolimus-monotherapy , side effect considerably low . RE disease deleterious natural course possible risk immunotherapy clearly outweigh . It must assume RE patient worldwide treat kind immunotherapy early disease stage due favorable case report literature . Therefore , placebo control group appear ethically unacceptable . This chose compare two promising substance . The ethic committee University Bonn approve study design .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients meet least two follow three criterion : 1 . Clinical : Epilepsia partialis continuum progressive* hemiparesis 2 . MRI : Progressive* cerebral hemiatrophy 3 . Histopathology : T cell dominate encephalitis activate microglial cell ( typically , necessarily form nodule ) reactive astrogliosis . Numerous macrophage , B cell plasma cell positive sign viral infection ( viral inclusion body immunohistochemical demonstration viral protein ) exclude diagnosis RE . `` Progressive '' mean least two sequential clinical examination MRI study document increase deficit tissue loss require meet respective criterion .
