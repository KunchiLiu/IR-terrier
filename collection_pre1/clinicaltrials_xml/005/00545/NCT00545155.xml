	<brief_title>Screening Interventions Acute Care Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many old adult ( age 64 ) undetected health problem lack basic prevention measure . Failure identify treat condition lead unnecessary morbidity mortality decrease quality life . Traditional screen intervention program , usually base primary care provider ' office , insufficient , particularly medically underserved population . Alternate sit screen intervention begin receive attention may hold promise . The emergency medical service ( EMS ) system unique , community-wide system use perform in-home evaluation uniformly screen large number vulnerable old adult emergency response . The emergency department ( ED ) entry point access medical social service many patient . Recent program use EMS system screen patient ED screen intervene mixed result , little do rigorously evaluate integrate program EMS screen lead focus ED intervention promote health older adult . This propose project build upon principal investigator 's preliminary work unique resource Rochester , NY develop evaluate program EMS screen ED intervention help community-dwelling older adult unmet need . Specifically , study aim : 1 . Implement EMS screen program identify community-dwelling old adult ' unmet need emergency response , identify patient need related depression dementia . 2 . Evaluate test-retest reliability concurrent criterion validity EMS screen depression cognitive impairment . 3 . Develop refine EMS ED intervention program address need old adult find EMS risk depression cognitive impairment . Upon completion , study demonstrate reliability validity EMS screen condition propose EMS ED base intervention program template apply wide range geriatric disorder .</detailed_description>
