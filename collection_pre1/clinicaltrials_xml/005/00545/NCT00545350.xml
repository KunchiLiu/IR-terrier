	<brief_title>Exercise Intervention Prevent Fall-related Fractures Other Injuries : The Oss√©bo Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Osteoporotic fracture major cause morbidity disability elderly woman . Most fracture result fall . Falls prevention measure largely applicable population may contribute significantly reduce number fracture population . Recent randomize control trial show exercise program relatively low intensity , center balance retraining targeted subject moderate risk , reduce risk fall 30 % community-dwelling elderly people ( Province MA et al 1995 ; Gillepsie LD et al 2003 ; Chang JT et al 2004 ) . But , effectiveness exercise prevent injury cause fall , particular serious one accompany fracture , demonstrate . Most previous trial underpowered examine effect fall prevention exercise programme severe injurious fall . Furthermore , consensus outcome fall related injury evaluate controlled trial , injurious fall definition vary substantially across study . Besides fall lead fracture serious injury , fall lead medical care use ought consider well , since cost society high burden health care system heavy . Falls cause minor injury also important , may also serious consequence , depression , fear fall , activity restriction . Objectives : To evaluate effectiveness exercise prevent fall result fracture physical trauma . Also , good understand mechanism physical exercise prevents injurious fall ( e.g. , improvement physical functional ability , global physical activity level , general physical mental health , self-confidence ) , determine individual factor associate good long-term adherence program . Method : Randomized controlled trial . Participants woman age 75 85 year old , living home , impaired physical functional capacity ( assessed simple functional test ) . Women recruit use general population list , voter-registration supplemental health-insurance membership roll . They randomize 2 group : one receive intervention , control group without . Each group include 1000 woman follow 2 year , allow demonstrate 30 % reduction frequency serious fall intervention group ( incidence serious fall around 8 % per year ) . Falls injuries occurrence monitor ask woman return monthly calendar card mark date fall . A telephone interview realize case fall report record circumstance consequence fall . Intervention : The intervention last 2 year implement partnership association SIEL ( Sport , Initiatives , et Loisir ) Bleu 20 study center locate large medium-sized city . It include weekly exercise session small group , lead qualify specially trained instructor , supplement simple exercise home . The exercise program focus progressive balance retrain also include strength/resistance , coordination flexibility training exercise . Evaluation criterion : The main outcome measure incidence serious fall define `` unexpected event participant come rest ground , floor , low level `` accompanied fracture another serious injury ( include head injury require hospitalization , joint dislocation , severe sprain , non-specified serious joint injury , laceration require suture ) ( Buchner DM et al 1993 ) . The effectiveness intervention injurious fall include lead moderate injury ( bruise , cut , abrasion reduction physical function least 3 day , participant seek medical help ( Campbell AJ et al 1997 ) also assess . Falls associate intrinsic major event overwhelm hazard ( e.g. , traffic accident ) exclude . Intermediate outcome measure , may help explain effect ( absence effect ) intervention , change physical functional capacity ( e.g. , balance , gait ) , global physical activity level , feel self-efficacy ( fear fall ) , general physical psychological well-being ( quality life ) . These change evaluate sample participant ( 160 per group ) re-examine 1 year 2 year . Expected result : The group intervention propose assess relatively simple implement . It rely network physical exercise instructor already establish across France . In case demonstrate benefit could therefore easily generalize part population-based public health program fall-related injury prevention elderly . The intervention enable elderly woman preserve two element essential quality life age , , functional capacity independence .</detailed_description>
