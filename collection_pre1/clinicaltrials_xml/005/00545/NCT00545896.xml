	<brief_summary>Chronic soft tissue wound represent difficult problem patient doctor well . Chronic wound cause internal dermatological disease like venous ulcer consequence venous insufficiency , arterial ulcer consequence peripheral occlusive vascular disease , diabetic foot stem diabetes pathology . A different reason chronic wound could prior traumatic injury ( war wound , traffic accident ) show tendency heal surgical repair . The primary goal treatment chronic soft tissue wound obtain wound closure . Usually necrotic tissue debrided , i.e . surgically remove , assess full extent damage , detect underlying abscess pathology cause non-healing wound . Wet - - wet dressing primarily apply induce heal process . As second line attempt obtain closure special dressing like semipermeable film , gel , hydrocolloid calcium alginates apply . These expensive dressing associate extended time period conservative treatment closure observe . A third line failure nonoperative treatment application skin graft . This involve operative anesthesiological risk already health wise compromise patient little physiological reserve . One forget majority patient present outpatient clinic chronic soft tissue wound elderly with/without disable comorbidities . The use extracorporeal shockwaves ( ESW ) clinical application introduce central Europe two decade ago . Extracorporeal shockwave therapy ( ESWT ) use field urology , orthopedic surgery , trauma surgery . ESW associate induction neovascularisation mechanical stimulus cause proliferation large number cell include osteoblast ( Martini L. , J Trauma 2006 ) . The exact effect ESW human cell currently study several center worldwide . The application ESWT mention field medicine prove safe , reliable almost complication-free . Our center 's experience ESWT trauma surgery ( Schaden W. , Clin . Orthop 2001 ) observation traumatic condition ( fracture non-union , etc . ) , also surround tissue show favorable tissue heal ESWT , lead hypothesis ESWT might beneficial much large number chronic soft tissue wound . The investigator anticipate induce complete wound heal number define clinical/pathological condition ESWT . At time efficacy safety ESWT investigate .</brief_summary>
