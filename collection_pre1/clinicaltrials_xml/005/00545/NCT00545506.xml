	<brief_title>The Influence Warmed Surgical Bandage System Subcutaneous Tissue Oxygen Tension After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wound infection common serious complication anesthesia surgery . The morbidity associate surgical infection considerable include substantial prolongation hospitalization . The wound infection risk patient undergoing cardiac surgery range 0.8 17.7 % include superficial deep sternal infection . Major factor influence incidence surgical wound infection site complexity surgery , underlie illness , timely administration prophylactic antibiotic , intraoperative patient temperature , hypovolemia tissue oxygen tension . The primary determinant tissue oxygen availability local perfusion . Thermoregulatory status one major factor influence tissue perfusion . Local warm induces pre- capillary vasodilation improve tissue oxygenation . Local warm surgical wound may provide simple inexpensive way reduce perioperative wound complication . Specifically , test hypothesis Warm- Up therapy increase postoperative tissue oxygen tension patient undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass .</detailed_description>
