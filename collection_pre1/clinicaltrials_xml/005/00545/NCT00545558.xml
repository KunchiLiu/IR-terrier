	<brief_title>Effects Anti-HIV Drugs Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) Adults Infected With Both HCV HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coinfection HCV HIV occur 20 % 30 % HIV infected people United States . Individuals HCV/HIV coinfection tend high HCV viral load individual HCV alone . However , current evidence suggest initiation effective antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) may associate increase HCV viral load . The purpose study evaluate change HCV viral load associate initiation ART HCV/HIV coinfected adult . All participant receive ART consist efavirenz daily co-formulation emtricitabine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( DF ) daily . If participant unable tolerate different regimen would prescribe . There least 21 study visit . During first week study , participant undergo blood draws viral kinetic sample initiation study medication . Following first week , weekly visit 96 week . At screen , participant undergo vital sign measurement , physical exam , medical history , blood collection , liver biopsy . During Week 1 , participant hospitalize 24 hour initiation ART viral kinetic sampling . Blood draw viral kinetic sampling HCV HIV perform Hours 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 . Participants return clinic hospital Hours 48 , 72 , 96 , 167 additional viral kinetic sampling . Blood collection occur visit ; physical exam , vital sign measurement , side effect questionnaire , urine semen collection occur select visit .</detailed_description>
