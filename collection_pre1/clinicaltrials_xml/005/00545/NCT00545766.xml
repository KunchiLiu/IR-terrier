	<brief_summary>Currently , establish 2nd-line salvage chemotherapy regimens patient HRPC , many retain excellent performance status . The antitumor characteristic toxicity profile vinflunine make ideal agent investigate set . In Phase II trial , plan evaluate efficacy , toxicity , feasibility administer IV vinflunine dose 320 mg/m2 q3w salvage chemotherapy patient HRPC . The patient evaluate response , survival , toxicity . If significant antitumor activity demonstrate , evaluation agent either alone combination regimen earlier stage disease indicate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This non-randomized ( single-arm ) , open-label , multi-center , single-agent , Phase II study vinflunine second- third-line treatment subject HRPC . The primary objective study evaluate efficacy vinflunine salvage treatment , measure Protein-Specific Antigen ( PSA ) Response Rate endpoint . The primary objective study follow : To evaluate efficacy ( measure PSA response rate ) IV vinflunine administer q3w HRPC patient progress one two previous chemotherapy regimen . Secondary Objectives The secondary objective study follow : - To evaluate efficacy IV vinflunine administer q3w HRPC patient previously receive chemotherapy ( one two regimen ) , measure : - Time PSA progression - Overall survival - Palliative response patient Analgesic Score ( AS ) â‰¥10 stable baseline pain - Health-Related Quality Life - To assess efficacy ( measure PSA response rate ) IV vinflunine HRPC patient base response prior chemotherapy - Chemotherapy responsive - previous response recent chemotherapy regimen last &gt; 2 month completion . - Chemotherapy refractory - failure respond , progression within three month complete last chemotherapy . - To assess response rate IV vinflunine subset patient measurable disease , measure traditional Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion ( Therasse et al . 2000 ) . - To evaluate safety IV vinflunine administer every three week HRPC patient previously receive chemotherapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men age 18 year age old HRPC eligible study base follow inclusion criterion : 1 . Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate . 2 . Progressive hormone refractory locally advance metastatic disease . ( Definition HRPC ) : Clinical serological evidence disease progression despite adequate antiandrogen therapy , document castrate level serum testosterone ( &lt; 50 ng/mL ) . Patients medical castration therapy continue treatment maintain castrate level serum testosterone . Patients receive antiandrogen estrogen therapy either maintain , document progression 4 week withdrawal agent ( except nilutamide bicalutamide ) , require 6 week . 3 . Disease Progression , document following : PSA Progression , document elevated PSA level ( &gt; 5 ng/mL ) , rise serially baseline PSA value ( PSA value # 1 ) two occasion , least 1 week apart ( consider PSA value # 2 # 3 ) . ( Note : level PSA value # 3 less level PSA value # 2 , subsequent PSA value must obtain ( PSA value # 4 ) least 1 week PSA value # 3 measure . In order event consider PSA progression , level final PSA value ( PSA value # 4 ) must great PSA level observe PSA value # 2 . Progressive metastatic prostate carcinoma , document compute tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , radiograph non osseous lesion ( see Section 7.2 ) . Bone Scan Progression , document appearance least one new lesion believe secondary tumor flare phenomenon . 4 . Patients bone disease must PSA level &gt; =5 ng/mL ; patient stable lesion must evidence PSA progression . Patients must radiographically clinically demonstrable metastatic disease . 5 . Receipt either 1 2 previous chemotherapy regimen ; one regimens must include docetaxel . 6 . ECOG performance status 02 . 7 . Adequate bone marrow function , define : white blood cell &gt; =3,500/uL , hemoglobin &gt; =8 g/dL , platelet count &gt; =100,000/uL . 8 . Adequate renal function , define : serum creatinine &lt; 1.8 mg/dL , calculate measure creatinine clearance ( GFR ) &gt; =60 cc/min . Patients creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min &lt; 60 mL/min may also enrol , require initial adjust dose ( see Section 5.1 ) 9 .
