	<brief_summary>There two distinct aim study : 1 . This prospective study design document long-term ( 10-year ) radiographic clinical outcome new type highly cross-linked polyethylene liner contain vitamin E anti-oxidant , ( E-Poly ) , group primary total hip arthroplasty subject . The clinical outcome E-Poly compare group subject receive Arcom XL polyethylene . 2 . This study also design document long-term ( 10-year ) radiographic clinical outcome new cementless acetabular component titanium porous surface ( Regenerex ) . The clinical outcome new FDA clear device compare group subject receive acetabular component plasma spray surface .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects require primary total hip replacement Subjects diagnosis osteoarthritis traumatic arthritis Subjects demonstrate ability return followup next 10 year Subjects limited life span Subjects difficulty comprehend study protocol reason . Subjects inflammatory disease , previous infection require revision hip surgery . Subjects avascular necrosis Subjects whose bony structure small femoral head le 32mm diameter must use . Subjects whose bony structure deviate substantially general norm sufficiently require nonstandard technique nonstandard implant . Specific example total dislocation hip , severe coxa vera deformity , severe form multiple epiphyseal dysplasia Subjects complex disease entity significantly increase risk surgery major platelet abnormality , hematological disorder , positive HIV major medical complication substantially reduce longevity . Female subject pregnant may suspect pregnant plan become pregnant participate study .</criteria>
