	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Of Thymoglobulin In Patients With Relapsed Or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasingly , upregulation antiapoptotic protein implicate pathogenesis development chemotherapy resistance multiple myeloma . Therapeutic intervention target apoptotic pathway myeloma attractive target treat resistant disease . Dexamethasone trigger apoptosis via release Smac ( second mitochondria-derived activator caspase ) lead activation caspase-9 caspase-3.37 The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib block signal transduction pathway mediate NF-ÎºB include regulation antiapoptotic gene TRAF1 2 ( TNF receptor-associated factor ) cIAP ( cellular inhibitor apoptosis ) BCLXL . Two independent investigator establish activity thymoglobulin multiple myeloma cell cell line patients.38,39 Thymoglobulin show induce apoptosis via distinct mechanism multiple myeloma cells.40 This action appear mediated interaction surface marker include CD80 , CD38 , CD40 CD45 . This appear stimulate apoptosis via cathepsin caspase pathways.39 By target different aspect apoptotic process , Thymoglobulin may provide mechanism overcome drug resistance multiple myeloma . Normal bone marrow B-cells , activate B cell plasma cell show undergo apoptosis concentration dependent manner rATG . The rATG show bind B cell bind competitively inhibit several B cell specific monoclonal antibody . The apoptosis inhibit specific pathway inhibitor caspase , cathepsin B lysosomal cysteine protease , indicate pathway stimulate thymoglobulin exposure . 18 Thymoglobulin high concentration bind complement result direct cell lysis lymphocytes.22 Anti-thymocyte globulin induce B cell apoptosis preferentially myelomonocytic T-cell lines.41,42 Both myeloma cell line primary myeloma cell patient bone marrow aspirate undergo apoptosis exposure thymoglobulin , might expect base apoptotic affect B-cell lineages.38 Additionally set cell undergo opsonization complement add vitro . This demonstrate thymoglobulin induce myeloma cell kill number method thus would less susceptible tumor resistance . The thymoglobulin bind site assess competitive binding monoclonal antibody . Thymoglobulin bind competitively specifically IgG , HLA-ABC , HLA-DR , CD16 , CD32 , CD64 , CD19 , CD20 , CD27 , CD30 , CD38 , CD40 , CD52 , CD80 , CD95 , CD126 , CD138 . Only IgG , CD16 , CD64 , CD80 competitively bound . The apoptosis primary cell inhibit block caspase , cathepsin D , cathepsin B &amp; D pathways . Zand et al also compare apoptotic response five different lot thymoglobulin . All lot apoptotic curve overlap range 1-120 mcg/ml , demonstrate little lot lot variation exists.43 This would expect since lot derive combine serum multiple immunized rabbit thus individual difference response rabbit would mitigate . This may case lot ATGAM derive single horse . Each lot thymoglobulin already deplete antibody red blood cell , virus inactivate tested lymphocytotoxicity prior release . The consistency demonstrate Zand et al consistent lack observe variation potency notice great 20 year clinical experience medication . Together , data provide rational clinical use Thymoglobulin multiple myeloma . As result , propose dose escalation , phase I , open-label study Thymoglobulin patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma .</detailed_description>
