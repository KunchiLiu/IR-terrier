	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate drug call avastin combination standard radiation possible treatment treatment recurrent pelvic-confined gynecological cancer ( i.e . endometrial , cervical , vulvar , ovarian vaginal cancer ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Of Avastin And Pelvic Radiation In Women With Recurrent Gynecological Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research study learn effect ( good bad ) antiangiogenic therapy drug ( drug stop new blood vessel growth starve tumor cut blood supply ) call avastin . Avastin antibody direct vascular endothelial growth factor , VEGF . VEGF potent , specific growth factor well-defined role normal abnormal blood vessel formation . It present wide variety normal tissue , produce excess solid cancer ( tumor ) . In set cancer , VEGF promote growth blood vessel bring nutrient tumor cell . In laboratory study , avastin show inhibit growth several different type human cancer cell . This drug study least 3500 people breast , colorectal , renal , ovarian lung cancer . It study combination radiation therapy people recurrent gynecological cancer . Previous clinical trial involve use avastin combination standard radiation colorectal pancreatic cancer show significant increase toxicity compare standard radiation therapy toxicity . The primary objective study assess toxicity administer avastin radiation recurrent gynecological cancer . The secondary endpoint ass time progression disease . This mean hope treatment program delay regrowth cancer compare standard therapy radiotherapy alone . In addition , well respond treatment , pattern remission recurrence measure .</detailed_description>
