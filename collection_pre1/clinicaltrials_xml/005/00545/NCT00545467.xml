	<brief_title>Evaluation Strategies Switching Schizophrenia Patients Aripiprazole From Other Antipsychotic Agents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aripiprazole ( commercial name abilify ) first commercially available drug dopamine partial agonist effect approve treatment schizophrenia bipolar disorder since 2002 U.S . It reduce negative symptom schizophrenia efficiently markedly low incidence extrapyramidal symptom tardive dyskinesia . However , process switch antipsychotic agent aripiprazole result re-emergence worsen psychosis , along unpleasant side effect insomnia , nausea , vomiting , anxiety agitation . On basis prior study demonstrate efficacy safety aripiprazole Taiwan population , hence propose apply combine use pharmacogenomics therapeutic drug monitoring evaluation strategy switch stable schizophrenia patient aripiprazole antipsychotic agent . We evaluate cytochrome P450 background along potential candidate gene schizophrenia . This 2-year proposal examine relative efficacy , safety tolerability two different strategy switch stable inpatients/outpatients prior antipsychotic monotherapy aripiprazole 15 mg/day monotherapy use two different strategy : 1 . Fast taper previous medication within 1 week initiate aripiprazole 2 week . 2 . Slow taper previous medication within 4 week initiate aripiprazole 2 week . A total 200 stable schizophrenia patient randomize open label two strategy . We expect achieve follow result : 1 . Developing protocol high probability switch successfully schizophrenia patient aripiprazole , effective treatment refractory case markedly low incidence severe side effect , antipsychotic . 2 . Elucidate pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic factor associate clinical efficacy aripiprazole .</detailed_description>
