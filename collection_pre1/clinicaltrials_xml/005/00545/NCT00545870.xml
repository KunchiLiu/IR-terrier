	<brief_summary>Treatment diabetic macular edema perifoveal focal/grid laser coagulation find effective save visual acuity 50 % patient 3-14 % treated patient improve visual acuity postoperatively . The decent result lasercoagulation associate potential side effect , focal scotoma , change color discrimination development epiretinal gliosis . The frequency perifoveal laser treatment anatomically limited case diabetic macular edema : application 350 coagulates possibility repeat laser treatment perifoveolar without create confluent lasercoagulates cause significant scotoma . In case persistence edema spite complete perifoveal grid coagulation , standard therapy exists . Some previous study investigate effect steroid patient diabetic macular edema unresponsive grid laser photocoagulation , benefit visual acuity temporary intravitreal application associate significant side effect cataract progression ( 50 % ) ocular hypertension ( 20 % ) . In Diabetic Retinopathy Study 4-years rate severe vision loss patient high-risk retinopathy 20.4 % . In case proliferative retinopathy , panretinal ( scatter ) photocoagulation reduce risk development high-risk retinopathy 50 % 6 year . When panretinal lasercoagulation initiate , 2000 laser spot equally distribute four quadrant . Since panretinal photocoagulation bar risk like loss field vision , central vision reduction loss colour vision , treatment continue unlimited . In case persist neovascularisations spite panretinal photocoagulation , evidence base therapy exist . There high risk intravitreal bleeding , rubeosis , secondary glaucoma severe vision loss . When fibrovascular proliferation lead retinal detachment , vitreo-retinal surgery might indicate . Now know vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) major angiogenic stimulus responsible increase vasopermeability , cellproliferation angiogenesis diabetic retinopathy ( DRP ) . Several study , evaluate VEGF level vitreous , indicated role VEGF diabetic macular edema : vitreous sample patient diabetic macular edema contain elevate VEGF concentration VEGF inject experimental study result breakdown blood-retina barrier . There increase evidence therapeutic role anti-VEGF drug age-related macular degeneration also diseases diabetic macular edema . Intravitreal injections become favored treatment procedure administer anti-VEGF drug . The side effect decent result laser treatment visual acuity diabetic macular edema lead study use anti-VEGF therapy . Unpublished study result aptamer pegaptanib ( Macugen™ ) promising . A study use antibody fragment Ranibizumab ( Lucentis™ ) patiens diabetic macula edema progress . Ranibizumab approve used intravitreal injection . Currently one additional anti-VEGF drug already market : Bevacizumab ( Avastin™ ) , approve intravenous infusion treatment metastatic colo-rectal cancer . Previous study show systemic use Bevacizumab ( Avastin™ ) obtain promising result patient choroidal neovascularisation ( CNV ) age-related macular degenetration . This drug , monoclonal full-length antibody , design bind isoforms VEGF large molecule . But case report patient CNV cause age-related macular degeneration macular edema central retinal vein occlusion indicate intravitreally give Bevacizumab ( Avastin™ ) effective disease originate choroid retina , . These finding imply sufficient penetration retina Bevacizumab ( Avastin™ ) . Based new finding important role VEGF diabetic retinopathy , propose pilot study treatment persistent diabetic macular edema persist active neovascularistaions follow lasercoagulation intravitreally administer Bevacizumab ( Avastin™ ) Ranibizumab ( Lucentis™ ) .</brief_summary>
