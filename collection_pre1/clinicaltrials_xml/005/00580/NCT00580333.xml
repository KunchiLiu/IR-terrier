	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect take cisplatin combination bevacizumab surgery standard chemotherapy plus bevacizumab surgery participant Estrogen Receptor ( ER ) negative , Progesterone Receptor ( PR ) negative Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 ( HER2 ) negative breast cancer . Cisplatin use destroy cancer cell many type cancer , show effective manageable side effect . Bevacizumab antibody , protein attack foreign substance body . Bevacizumab slow stop cell growth cancerous tumor decrease blood supply tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Cisplatin Bevacizumab ER- , PR- , HER2 Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- To prepare surgery , small `` clip '' place tumor area surgeon locate site tumor time surgery . This standard procedure breast cancer . - The study drug give four 3-week cycle ( 3 month ) . Participants come clinic day receive study treatment intravenously . Cisplatin give day one treatment cycle ( every 3 week ) four cycle . Bevacizumab give day one treatment cycle three cycle . - On day one 3-week cycle physical exam , routine blood test urine test perform . 7-8 day chemotherapy , blood test hear test perform . A preoperative study visit take place 7-10 day surgery physical exam , routine blood test , Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) breast perform . - Surgery remove tumor occur least three week last dose cisplatin consider standard care . - Postoperative chemotherapy begin least three week surgery . Everyone research study receive four 2-week cycle doxorubicin cyclophosphamide plus bevacizumab . After 8 week , doctor decide follow two treatment regimen participant receive : Bevacizumab four 2-week cycle ( every two week ) ; Paclitaxel plus bevacizumab four 2-week cycle ( every two week ) . - At end postoperative chemotherapy , participant return clinic medical history , physical exam , vital sign , performance status , routine blood test , multiple gated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) Echocardiogram Scans , hear test .</detailed_description>
