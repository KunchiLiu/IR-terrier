	<brief_summary>The overall goal proposal determine role autonomic nervous system insulin resistant state associate obesity metabolic syndrome . Obesity result accumulation excessive fat deposit due increase caloric intake decrease energy expenditure , condition usually associate disease hypertension diabetes , cluster know metabolic syndrome . The first step development metabolic syndrome resistance action insulin . The mechanism underlie insulin resistance obesity still unknown , however investigator propose autonomic nervous system , particularly increase sympathetic activation obesity may play important role . We extensive experience study role autonomic nervous system cardiovascular alteration associate obesity produce complete autonomic withdrawal drug name trimethaphan . We propose use approach study role autonomic nervous system development insulin resistance obesity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Autonomic Nervous System Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study look role autonomic nervous system , involuntary nervous system control blood pressure , insulin resistance metabolic syndrome . Insulin substance help body use sugar food eat . Some people 's tissue stop react normal way insulin , condition know insulin resistance . A person insulin resistance health problem , obesity , high cholesterol , high blood pressure . These problem together call metabolic syndrome . We think autonomic involuntary nervous system control way body respond insulin . This system change obese people , think may cause insulin resistance . We plan study two drug -trimethaphan L-NMMA . Neither drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , use research purpose . Fifty people take part study .</detailed_description>
