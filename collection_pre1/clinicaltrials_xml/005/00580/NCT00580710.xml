	<brief_summary>This study design investigate effect diabetes mellitus treatment upon body 's response low blood glucose ( blood sugar ) level . Diabetes medical condition blood glucose rise high . Treatment diabetes mellitus involves give insulin ( hormone ) , occasionally cause blood glucose fall low . The body respond low glucose level produce number hormone , act insulin help correct low blood glucose . These hormone also provide symptom warn glucose fall far . These protective warning body may different people diabetes . We want test whether also mean diabetes change sensitivity brain function lower blood glucose level . In order answer question , need compare response people diabetes response people diabetes . The plan study low subject 's blood glucose use insulin , measure change occur brain function use call functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previous study show person type 1 diabetes less likely suffer long term microvascular complication diabetes ( eye , kidney nerve damage ) strive achieve near normal blood glucose possible . Unfortunately tight blood glucose control , likely subject suffer episodes hypoglycemia . Hypoglycemia often aspect diabetes management feared people diabetes may cause anxiety threat advance complication . For many people diabetes problem hypoglycemia compound development syndrome hypoglycemia unawareness . One aspect hypoglycemia unawareness impairment hormone normally release blood glucose fall . Hypoglycemia trigger release insulin antagonist epinephrine , norepinephrine , glucagon , growth hormone cortisol . These hormone act synergistically autonomic nervous system raise blood glucose , counteract insulin restore normoglycemia . These homeostatic mechanism also responsible early symptom low blood glucose , provide warn insulin-treated diabetic glucose fall . A number study include research unit establish strict metabolic control associate impairment normal counterregulatory response hypoglycemia loss hypoglycemia awareness . The brain central recognition hypoglycemia coordination counterregulatory response . Neural tissue depend mainly glucose energy supply . As circulate glucose fall beneath level need maintain glucose transport across blood-brain barrier , variety defense mechanism activate , include symptom cognitive dysfunction . However , precise nature cause adverse CNS effect hypoglycemia well understood . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) provide tool measure effect hypoglycemia pattern magnitudes neuronal activation human brain , normal diabetic subject .</detailed_description>
