Behavioral component impulsivity test delay probability discounting task . Finally , measure frontotemporal functioning also include neuropsychology neurocognitive battery . Recent study show area brain function differently pathological gambler ; thus , follow neuropsychology/neurocognitive test include : Attention/Information Processing Speed ( via Simple Reaction Time Task Continuous Performance Task ) , Episodic Memory ( via Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised Brief Visuospatial Memory Test ) , Executive/Frontal Lobe Measures ( via Wechsler Memory Scale-III , Choice Reaction Time Task , Working Memory Task ( N-back ) , Probabilistic Reversal Learning Task , Stop-Signal Task ) . Between group comparison battery impulsivity test make clarify component impulsivity associate pathological gambling . Secondly , within-group analysis perform correlate impulsivity gamble severity . Lastly , exploratory analysis subtyping pathological gambler performance task impulsivity type gamble conduct .</detailed_description>
