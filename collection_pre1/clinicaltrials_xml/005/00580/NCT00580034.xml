	<brief_summary>Allogeneic transplantation use treat many malignant non-malignant disease , though potential toxicity procedure remain high . We others show less toxic preparative regimen allow reliable allogeneic engraftment allogeneic transplantation . The primary purpose treatment trial follow patient undergo allogeneic transplantation long term outcome . The regimen use test prior phase I / II trial complete accrual . The issue engraftment rate graft versus host disease answer success lead regimen standard approach less toxic allogeneic therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may cure ameliorate illness many type ; however toxicity procedure limit broad applicability . Hematologic malignancy type show response . Those marrow failure , aplasia , hemoglobinopathy show response multiple trial well . Even patient certain solid tumor , breast , renal cell , melanoma show partial complete response allogeneic therapy . The limit effect historical method aggressive induction allogeneic therapy extremely toxic , require limit offer allogeneic therapy healthy ill patient . Work last decade show less toxic agent target immune system effectively allow engraftment less effect patient 's liver , lung , vital organ . We others complete multiple trial show effective use less toxic , non-myeloablative , regimens allogeneic therapy . Trials fludarabine cyclophosphamide standard dos ( patient ablate recover blood count 2 week ) allow 80 % patient engraft donor cell . Some group add low dos radiation combination , 80-100 % allogeneic engraftment . The lessened toxicity approach confirm multiple study , include data specific schema treatment plan review . Phase I result combination : Our group combine combination fludarabine cyclophosphamide antibody CAMPATH 1H . This antibody give patient purge immune system prevent rejection . It also purge T cell donate stem cell minimize graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . This approach proven successful multiple trial use standard toxic ablative procedure . Our approach last 3 year successful use antibody less toxic non-myeloablative procedure trial complete . The primary purpose treatment trial follow patient undergo allogeneic transplantation long term outcome . The regimen use test prior phase I / II trial complete accrual . The issue engraftment rate graft versus host disease answer success lead regimen standard approach less toxic allogeneic therapy .</detailed_description>
