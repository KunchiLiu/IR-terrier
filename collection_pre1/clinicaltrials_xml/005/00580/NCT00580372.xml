	<criteria>Previously untreated patient diagnosis multiple myeloma eligible . Similarly , patient one cycle standard chemotherapy one month interferon and/or glucocorticoid eligible . Patients must objective evidence , symptomatic , complication due myeloma ( e.g. , bone pain fracture , weakness anemia ) . Asymptomatic patient may treat diagnosis confirm evidence increase tumor mass ( e.g. , rise myeloma protein and/or increase lytic lesion ) . Asymptomatic patient idiopathic monoclonal peak , localize plasmacytoma , indolent , asymptomatic myeloma eligible study . Any patient without documented increase disease and/or clearly symptomatic disease eligible . Measurable , direct manifestation myeloma must present , monoclonal serum urine globulin . Plasma cell tumor must also document . Patients without protein criterion eligible bone marrow &gt; 30 % plasmacytosis document bilateral bone marrow aspiration biopsy . Patients stag multiple myeloma ( I , II , III ) eligible . Necessary baseline study must obtain determine stage prior registration . Patients may receive local radiation painful compression fracture lytic bone lesion , provide adequate autologous bone marrow still harvest . Patients present clinical condition require radiotherapy ( e.g . spinal cord compression ) may proceed concurrent local radiation VAD . Should compression fracture know prestudy lytic lesion occur later , myelosuppressive phase induction therapy , radiotherapy complete first prior proceed highdose cyclophosphamide , EDAP melphalan . Patients older 15 year age may 65 year old . Pregnant female exclude study . Eligibility criterion change progress different phase induction program towards two cycle marrowablative therapy . These summarized eligibility checklist . Briefly , prior VAD , patient must normal cardiac ejection fraction &gt; 50 % ( ECHO cardiography MUGGA scan ) , fairly normal liver function test ( bilirubin &lt; 2 mg % serum transaminase level less 2 x normal ) . Screening viral hepatitis negative acute chronic active hepatitis . Positive antibody ( antiHAV , HBSAb ) suggestive remote exposure acceptable . However , patient test positive Hepatitis C antibody ( antiHCV ) HIV ineligible . Those renal failure eligible start VAD promptly receive additional medical measure need . Patients present infection upon presentation shall receive proper medical management prior start therapy . Patient 's performance status criterion entry VAD portion program . After 2 3 cycle VAD , serum creatinine level must 2 mg % carbon monoxide diffusion capacity 50 % . Cardiac liver function requirement VAD . Not reach highdose melphalan stage 70 mg/M2 requirement Zubrod performance 0 1 must also fulfil 2 marrowablative dos melphalan ( 200 mg/M2 ) . Less 10 x 108 cells/kg store . granulocyte count le 1500/µl platelet count less 150,000/µl .</criteria>
