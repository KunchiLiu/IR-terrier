	<brief_title>Does Antenatal Fetal Head Circumference Predict Anal Sphincter Injury , Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Even though much work invest try identify risk factor predict population suffer sphincter tear pelvic floor trauma , epidemiology still poorly understood . Factors implicate include operative vaginal delivery , birth weight , primaparity . Up point little focus place antenatal factor would help predict prevent sphincter disruption . At time birth infant 's head large part body . Thus , head circumference infant may able predict subject likely suffer sphincter disruption . Thus , study aim determine whether fetal head circumference measure antenatally predictive pelvic floor trauma .</detailed_description>
