This proposal systematically replicate extend finding . A Stage II trial compare three treatment condition : ( 1 ) cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) ; ( 2 ) CBT plus CM ; ( 3 ) CBT plus enhanced CM model target increase early abstinence rate , parent skill , maintenance effect . Replicating initial demonstration positive effect CM extend scientific evidence use CM increase treatment efficacy substance-abusing adolescent . Testing enhanced CM model determine modification consistent underlying behavioral principle empiricism support CM intervention result improve outcome . Last , assessment potential mechanism action , particularly parenting , adolescent psychopathology impulsivity , provide scientific information directly relevant future development effective intervention prevention model adolescent substance abuse , inform u fundamental mechanism operate drug-dependence .</brief_summary>
