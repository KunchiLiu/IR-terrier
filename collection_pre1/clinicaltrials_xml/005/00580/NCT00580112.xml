	<brief_title>An Efficacy Study Trabectedin Treatment Participants With Specific Subtypes Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , prospective ( study follow participant forward time ) , multi-center ( 1 hospital medical school team work medical research study ) study evaluate effectiveness safety trabectedin 3 subpopulation breast cancer participant : Group A : triple negative profile estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor human estrogen receptor , Group B : human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 overexpressing tumor ( HER-2+ ) Group C : familial breast cancer gene 1 ( BRCA1 ) breast cancer gene 2 ( BRCA2 ) mutation carrier . Participants receive trabectedin 1.3 milligram per square meter ( mg/m^2 ) intravenous infusion ( fluid medicine deliver vein way needle ) 3-hour every 3 week , Day 1 cycle . Each cycle length 3 week . Treatment continue disease progression , unmanageable toxicity , participant refusal treatment delay longer 3 week due toxicity . Efficacy primarily evaluate percentage participant confirm objective response independent external review Investigators assessment . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
