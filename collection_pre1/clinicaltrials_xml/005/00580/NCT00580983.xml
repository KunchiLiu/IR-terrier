	<brief_summary>The purpose study test whether use advanced radiation therapy delivery technique spare patient 's normal tissue , include salivary gland , radiation . This study do try reduce radiation side effect , especially mouth dryness , happen standard radiation method . In order reduce side effect , normal tissue may receive different radiation dose ( sometimes ) would receive use standard radiation therapy . A secondary goal study determine type tumor patient control least well ( well ) use advanced radiation therapy delivery technique would patient treated standard radiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Studies show dose response relationship salivary gland exists may possible improve significantly post-radiation xerostomia quality life radiation technique devise would spare salivary gland adequately treat target . A new treatment modality ( computer-optimized IMRT ) facilitate increased spar noninvolved tissue , specifically spar parotid gland , conformal high-dose delivery bilateral neck target patient head neck cancer . This study evaluate benefit regard xerostomia-specific general QOL patient receive head neck RT use modality . Assessment swallow dysfunction aspiration make use videofluoroscopy . In addition , study evaluate pattern local/regional tumor recurrence , ass whether spar parotid gland may cause tumor recurrence spar neck area .</detailed_description>
