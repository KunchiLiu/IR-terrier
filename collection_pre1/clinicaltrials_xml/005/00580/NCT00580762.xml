	<brief_title>Bariatric Surgery ESRD Patients v Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study design compare two cohort patient undergo laparoscopic RYGB . Cohort 1 include ESRD patient HD meet NIH guideline preoperative requirement RYGB . Cohort 2 include non-ESRD patient meet NIH guideline preoperative requirement RYGB . Laparoscopic RYGB perform ESRD patient meet guideline recommend National Institutes Health consensus statement . This include patient either BMI≥40 kg/m2 BMI≥35 kg/m2 significant morbidity attribute obesity ( i.e . sleep apnea , hypertension , diabetes mellitus ) . All patient undergo complete pre-operative evaluation inclusive dietary instruction , assessment surgical risk , psychosocial evaluation compliance evaluation . This evaluation conduct exist infrastructure investigator Bariatric Surgery Center . Patients required hemodialysis able convert hemodialysis perioperative period . All procedure perform team surgeon , experience laparoscopic RYGB , organ transplantation general surgery ESRD patient . The risk involve Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery discuss patient . These risk inherent procedure , however procedure conduct medical appropriate reason therefore benefit procedure outweigh risk . At present time , believe , without justification , procedure risky risky ESRD population . A primary objective study investigate question .</detailed_description>
