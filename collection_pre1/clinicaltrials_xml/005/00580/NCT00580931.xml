	<brief_title>Safety Study Nicotinamide Treat Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal proposal show , nicotinamide ( NA ) , B3 vitamin , safe effective treatment patient mild moderate Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . NA known block ability certain protein regulate protein remove acetyl group . Recent evidence demonstrate inhibitor NA prevent nerve cell degeneration model Huntington 's disease ( HD ) , Parkinson 's disease Lou Gehrig 's disease ( ALS ) . Despite beneficial effect many different animal model , study date use inhibitor AD . In recent study find potent inhibitor , NA , significantly improve learn memory transgenic mouse develop AD . NA treatment also result striking change tau , protein abnormally accumulate AD . NA extensively use clinical study last 40 year generally safe well-tolerated . As NA safe readily available vitamin supplement , recent result provide strong argument study NA patient AD . We therefore propose treat 50 patient mild moderate AD either NA ( 1500 milligram twice day ) identical inactive drug ( placebo ) 24 week . At 6 week interval assess function learn memory , ability carry daily activity well caregiver report use standardized test . We also perform spinal tap begin end study measure level abnormal tau protein cerebrospinal fluid . Blood test periodically do ass liver function complete blood count . The result study may provide basis extensive study NA treatment mild moderate AD .</detailed_description>
