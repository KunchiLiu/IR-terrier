	<brief_summary>The investigator propose test hypothesis sympathetic nervous system contribute cardiovascular inflammatory abnormality present chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) , particular subset patient characterized postural tachycardia syndrome ( POTS ) . CFS POTS see mostly otherwise normal young woman , cause significant disability . A substantial proportion patient refer evaluation POTS meet diagnostic criterion CFS , conversely , subset patient refer treatment CFS POTS . The investigator hypothesize sympathetic activation underlies pathophysiology patient CFS POTS overlap ( CFS-P ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autonomic Nervous System Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Specific Aim 1 , investigator use state-of-the-art measurement sympathetic activity ( autonomic function test , response trimethaphan , direct nerve sympathetic traffic recording microneurography , plasma norepinephrine , intraneuronal metabolite ) , inflammatory mediator ( C-reactive protein , inflammatory cytokine ) , oxidative stress ( isoprostanes ) patient CFS-P . It important appropriate control group include , also study patient CFS without orthostatic tachycardia , patient POTS without CFS , normal control . The investigator document abnormality volume regulation POTS patient . Hypovolemia contribute sympathetic activation , vice versa , sympathetic activation contribute hypovolemia . Interrupting vicious circle acute saline infusion effective treatment improve symptom POTS patient . Not surprisingly , many POTS patient follow investigator , CFS patient follow Dr. David Bell , use saline pulse therapy way alleviate symptom . However , efficacy safety approach proven . The investigator propose validate treatment Specific Aim 2 . This group study show nitric oxide arguably important metabolic factor involve cardiovascular regulation . Abnormalities nitric oxide propose contribute CFS POTS , prove challenge part due interaction sympathetic nervous system . In Specific Aim 3 , investigator propose investigate importance nitric oxide CFS-P patient use experimental approach develop laboratory eliminate nitric oxide/autonomic interaction . Finally , Specific Aim 4 , propose proof-of-concept study test hypothesis sympathetic activation contribute many abnormality find CFS patient . If hypothesis correct , inhibition sympathetic tone result improvement abnormality describe volume , inflammation , oxidative stress . More importantly , result symptomatic improvement patient . The investigator believe , therefore , study propose application improve understand pathophysiology CFS , provide rationale approach treatment disable condition .</detailed_description>
