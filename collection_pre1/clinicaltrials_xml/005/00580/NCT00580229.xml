	<brief_summary>This study open-label prospective analysis oral prednisone ( compare IV methylprednisolone ) pre-treatment rituximab patient rheumatoid arthritis . The study useful pilot data establish different trend two treatment strategy decrease frequency severity acute infusion reaction . It would also establish proof principle pre-treatment oral prednisone equally efficacious IV methylprednisolone . The primary endpoint ass safety tolerability rituximab ( Rituxan ) RA . By show difference frequency severity acute infusion reaction rituximab use pre-treatment oral prednisone compare I.V . methylprednisolone , establish proof principle oral prednisone viable alternative I.V . methylprednisolone . Pre-treatment oral prednisone would practical advantage patient treat physician . The patient could self-administer treatment home thereby decreasing time would need spend infusion center . Further , dose prednisone few side effect 100mg methylprednisolone .</brief_summary>
