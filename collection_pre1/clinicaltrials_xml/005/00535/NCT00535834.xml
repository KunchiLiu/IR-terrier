	<brief_title>Studying Stored Samples From Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer Treated Clinical Trial NCI-00-C-0154</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate formation antibody complex serum sample take initiation treatment completion therapy prostate cancer patient previously enrol clinical trial NCI-00-C-0154 . - Evaluate immunologic response . Secondary - Clone underlying tumor antigen discover SEREX . OUTLINE : Samples previously collect clinical trial NCI-00-C-0154 ( whole blood , serum , peripheral mononuclear blood cell ) analyze immunologic response evidence formation anti-tumor antibody . Western blot use detect evidence vaccine-induced autoantibody response . If indication response , SEREX use clone underlie antigen .</detailed_description>
