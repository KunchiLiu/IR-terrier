	<brief_summary>The purpose study see small dose propofol give intravenously ( needle vein ) end anesthesia make less likely child agitate come anesthetic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Propofol Emergence Agitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergence agitation define mental disturbance recovery general anesthesia . It consist confusion , disorientation , delusion , hallucination . It manifest child combination restlessness , moaning , inconsolable cry , involuntary physical activity , thrash . This put patient risk injure caregiver , cause bleed disruption surgical repair , pull IVs drain . It difficult maintain necessary vital sign monitoring agitate patient , constant one-on-one nursing often require . When emergence agitation occur , member healthcare team , parent report dissatisfaction quality child 's recovery anesthesia . Propofol commonly use intravenous anesthetic agent . Studies compare continuous infusion intravenous propofol versus inhalational sevoflurane maintenance anesthesia . These show significant decrease incidence emergence agitation patient receive propofol infusion . This propose study investigate effect single bolus dose propofol conclusion sevoflurane inhalational anesthetic .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age : 12 month 6 year old Planned surgery/procedure : The goal enroll patient pain awake anesthesia . We include patient magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) anesthesia , eye exam anesthesia . We also include patient surgery regional caudal block part plan anesthetic . This small orthopedic procedure low extremity ; urologic general surgical procedure level umbilicus . These patient choose regional/caudal block result patient pain awake anesthesia . ( The caudal block single epidural injection local anesthetic do pediatric patient general anesthesia . It routine procedure result numbness level umbilicus , give relief pain , 8 hour . ) Examples orthopedic surgery include , limited : Removal extra digit syndactyly repair Club foot release Lower extremity tendon release lengthening Lower extremity tendon transfer Removal hardware Examples urologic surgery include , limited : Circumcision circumcision revision hypospadias repair Chordee repair Orchiopexy Orchiectomy Examples general pediatric surgery include , limited : Inguinal hernia repair Rectal muscle biopsy Excision low extremity lower abdominal mass Burn scar release skin graft Obstructive sleep apnea—Patients sleep apnea ideal candidate removal endotracheal tube laryngeal mask airway still somewhat anesthetized . It preferable extubate patient awake . Developmental delays—Patients developmental delay may interact environment , make eye contact , purposeful action , aware surroundings even baseline preoperatively . It would difficult evaluate feature emergence agitation child demonstrate behavior routine basis . Psychological disorders—Patients psychological disorder may issue developmental delay come evaluate behavior anesthesia . Egg white allergy—Propofol contraindicate patient egg white allergy due risk allergy propofol lecithin base .</criteria>
