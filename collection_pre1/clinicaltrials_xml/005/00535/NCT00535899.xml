	<brief_summary>In patient aortic stenosis low ejection fraction , predict recover ejection fraction aortic valve replacement ? We plan observe 50 patient Low EF aortic stenosis perform serial echocardiogram pre post-aortic valve replacement analyze regional wall motion contractility new software application call speckle track imaging .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Speckle Tracking Imaging Patients With Low Ejection Fraction Aortic Stenosis ( SPArKLE-AS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient severe aortic stenosis LV dysfunction , 76 % patient improvement ventricular function NYHA class , aortic valve replacement . The prognostic indicator patient recover EF post-operatively , fully establish , link history prior MI pre-operative aortic valve area . Furthermore hypothesize ventricle recover fibrosed , either prior MI long stand LVH ( hypertrophy ) . Currently systolic diastolic function measure pre-operatively standard 2D echo Doppler . 2D Strain Strain rate image speckle track novel method assess regional well global `` contractility '' . This method overcome many limitation inherent assess myocardial function current methodology , mainly reproducible , objective , independent myocardial translation , tether furthermore speckle track derive B mode image independent Doppler angle.The applicability technology patient aortic valve stenosis systolic dysfunction clinical significance evaluate . We hypothesize patient reduce peak systolic strain rate diastolic strain rate baseline adjust LVEF poor recovery LVEF relatively preserve strain strain rate . As pilot study , plan prospectively analyze 50 consecutive patient severe aortic stenosis leave ventricular systolic dysfunction , EF 40 % Speckle imaging derive strain rate image pre post-operatively aortic valve replacement . This would do part routine pre-operative post-operative transthoracic echocardiography use standard view , exception study would need do GE Vivid 7 digital ultrasound system . Speckle derive image data derive standard B mode ( Grey scale image ) , frame rate 50 f/s . 3 D image also obtain . Post-operative TTE 's performed discharge 4-12 months+/- 30 day discharge . Baseline characteristic take standard pre-operative baseline study include basic 2 D valve area , EF , wall thickness geometry , Doppler flow data . Exclusion criterion : Patients prior cardiac surgery include CABG valve replacement , mild mitral valve aortic regurgitation chronic kidney disease ( Cr 1.5 ) , emergent aortic valve replacement , endocarditis , CAD LHC &gt; 50 % . Informed consent obtain patient , include consent . No surgery delay purpose study proper hardware/GE VIVID system available .</detailed_description>
