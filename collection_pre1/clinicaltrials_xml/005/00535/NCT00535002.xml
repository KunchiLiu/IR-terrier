	<detailed_description>Cocaine dependence insidious disease underscore strong propensity relapse despite knowledge repercussion continue drug-use . Stress cocaine cue produce crave ultimately relapse cocaine dependent individual . Pre-clinical research demonstrate sex difference response cocaine-conditioned cue cocaine-primed reinstatement , correlate well reduce plasma progesterone level . Interestingly , consistent grow body clinical literature indicate progesterone may decrease reinforce property stimulant woman . Gender difference response social stressor cocaine cue cocaine-dependent individual demonstrate human laboratory study , however , interaction stress cue effect hormonal status response explore . This study examine role hormonal status response cocaine-related cue without pharmacological stressor ( yohimbine ) cocaine-dependent woman men . As integration research focus study also explore relationship impulsivity craving .</detailed_description>

Nicotine dependence affect HPA function ( Baron et al. , 1995 ) therefore would ideal exclude subject nicotine use . Because high comorbidity cocaine nicotine dependence , would seriously compromise feasibility recruitment . Individuals alcohol dependence exclude . However high comorbidity alcohol use cocaine dependence , individual alcohol abuse include .

Because ADHD commonly characterize impulsivity , ADHD severity rating determine control data analysis . Subjects must consent random assignment . Subjects must consent outpatient admission CTRC two overnight admission Medical University Hospital . Women pregnant , nurse childbearing potential practicing effective mean birth control .

Subjects evidence history significant hematological , endocrine , cardiovascular , pulmonary , renal , gastrointestinal , neurological disease include diabetes , condition may affect physiological/subjective response . Subjects Addison 's disease , Cushing 's disease diseases adrenal cortex likely affect hormonal/neuroendocrine status . Subjects history current psychotic disorder bipolar affective disorder may interfere subjective measurement . Subjects current major depressive disorder posttraumatic stress disorder disorder associate characteristic change stress response . Subjects panic disorder , yohimbine may precipitate panic attack . Subjects receive synthetic glucocorticoid therapy , exogenous steroid therapy , treatment agent interfere hormonal measurement within one month test session . Subjects take psychotropic medication , antidepressant , opiate opiate antagonist may affect test response . Subjects take SSRI 's include . Subjects acute illness fever . Individuals otherwise meet study criterion reschedule evaluation participation . Subjects obese ( BMI &gt; 35 ) may interfere hormonal status .
