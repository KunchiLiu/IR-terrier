	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : AZD2281 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving AZD2281 together irinotecan may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose AZD2281 irinotecan treating patient locally advance metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine recommended phase II dose AZD2281 irinotecan hydrochloride patient locally advance metastatic colorectal cancer . - To determine safety , tolerability , toxicity profile , dose-limiting toxicity , pharmacokinetic profile regimen . - To assess correlation , , toxicity profile pharmacokinetics regimen . - To assess , preliminarily , antitumor activity regimen patient measurable disease . - To demonstrate pharmacodynamic activity regimen establish effect tumor biopsy , cheek swab , blood sample . - To assess correlation , , patient tumor demonstrate microsatellite instability antitumor activity pharmacodynamic effect regimen . - To investigate impact common genetic polymorphism gene relevant pathway ( drug metabolism , DNA repair , apoptosis ) outcome toxicity well pharmacodynamic effect . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study AZD2281 irinotecan hydrochloride . - Part I : Patients receive oral AZD2281 twice day day -7 21 course 1 day 1-21 subsequent course . Patients also receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day ( course 1 28 day ) maximum tolerate dose determine absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Part II : Patients receive oral AZD2281 daily day 1-5 irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute day 3 maximum tolerate dose determined Part I . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo cheek swab , tumor tissue , blood sample collection periodically pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic , correlative study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
