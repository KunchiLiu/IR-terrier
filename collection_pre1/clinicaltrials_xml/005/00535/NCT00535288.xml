	<detailed_description>The direct treatment hot flush may mean 5-HT2A receptor antagonist . Mirtazapine potent blocker 5-HT2A receptor find effective reduce number intensity hot flush preliminary trial . Also several Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors ( SSRIs ) similar compound investigated manage hot flush , confirm role serotonergic system . In present trial , efficacy safety four different dos esmirtazapine compare placebo investigate woman moderate severe vasomotor symptom associate menopause . The primary objective trial demonstrate superior efficacy least one four dos esmirtazapine compare placebo four follow co-primary endpoint : 1 ) mean change baseline average daily frequency moderate severe vasomotor symptom Week 4 ; 2 ) mean change baseline average daily frequency moderate severe vasomotor symptom Week 12 ; 3 ) mean change baseline average daily severity moderate severe vasomotor symptom Week 4 ; 4 ) mean change baseline average daily severity moderate severe vasomotor symptom Week 12 . The number severity hot flush record mean electronic diary subject .</detailed_description>
