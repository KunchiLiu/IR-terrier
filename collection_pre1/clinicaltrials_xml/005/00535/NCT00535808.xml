	<brief_summary>In prospective randomize study protocol , three different blood pressure regulate agent ( nitroprusside , nitroglycerine , sevoflurane ) compare concern effect cerebral oxygen balance hemispheres aortic coarctation repair . Cerebral somatic saturation monitor non-invasively continuously via optical sensor apply right leave forehead somatic region . Arterial blood pressure , central venous pressure , heart rate systemic saturation record continuously . Intermittently , arterial venous blood gas analysis perform 6 definite time interval .
