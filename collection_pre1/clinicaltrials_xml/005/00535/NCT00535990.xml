	<brief_title>Minimally Invasive Surgery ( MIS ) Database Purpose Research</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Minimally invasive surgery become gold standard surgical treatment many indication , treatment gallstone acute appendicitis . For many indication , potential minimally invasive approach exist , data yet exist establish gold standard . In addition , certain patient factor age weight may influence success minimally invasive procedure . While numerous article literature report outcome minimally invasive therapy , series often notable small patient population vary definition treatment success study study . Due lack uniformity reporting patient outcome , opportunity exists establish standardize database large number patient undergoing procedure . A standardized database facilitate conduct prospective research risk factor benefit minimally invasive surgery . This analysis enhance care provide patient , reduce use ineffective therapy , thus promote improve efficiency increase quality care provide within UCSD system . This initial application . Several department UCSD develop similar database . There numerous example prospective database use similar purpose literature . Smithers , et al , use prospective database 446 patient undergoing esophagectomy compare open laparoscopic outcome . Nesset , et al , maintain database bariatric surgery patient two decade able draw conclusion data set 1584 patient . Even small number , prospective database useful . Andrew , et al , describe improvement outcome learn curve first 201 patient undergoing laparoscopic roux-en-Y gastric bypass use database . Though labor intensive , Clemmesen , et al , find maintain database allow improve care patient .</detailed_description>
