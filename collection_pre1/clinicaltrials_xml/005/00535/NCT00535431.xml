	<brief_summary>This single centre , double-blind , randomise , parallel group , repeat dose asthmatic subject . Subjects receive AER 001 ( 60 mg ) placebo twice daily 28 day . Before treatment subject experimentally challenge inhaled allergen induce decrease lung function . The primary outcome late phase response allergen measure average percent change FEV1 4-10 hour follow allergen . Because AER 001 Th2 anti-inflammatory , hypothesize AER 001 treatment inhibit late phase response allergen challenge .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : Primary Objective To investigate effect AER 001 late asthmatic response mild moderate asthmatic Secondary Objectives - To examine effect AER 001 antigen induce airway hyperactivity adenosine monophosphate blood level circulate IgE . - To characterise pharmacokinetics nebulised AER 001 . Exploratory Objectives - To examine effect AER 001 circulate sIL-13Rα2 IFNgamma . - To examine result single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) analysis IL-4 , IL-13 , IL-4Rα IL-13R α determine correlation AER 001 response genotype - To examine level anti-AER 001 follow administration AER 001 Methodology : - Single centre , double-blind , randomise , parallel group , repeat dose study male female asthmatic subject . - A sufficient number subject ( least 30 subject ) recruit ensure least 26 complete set data obtain . - Subjects randomise receive either AER 001 60 mg / match volume Placebo ratio 1 active : 1 placebo ( block size 6 ) . - Treatments administer nebulization PARI LC Plus nebulizer - Subjects receive b.i.d . administration AER 001 / placebo 27 day . A morning dose give Day 28 , ( 24 hour Day 27 am-dose ) .</detailed_description>
