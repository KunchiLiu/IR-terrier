	<brief_summary>The objective trial determine relationship within participant time manual detection reappearance fourth twitch ( T4 ) measure use peripheral nerve stimulator ( PNS ) time recovery fourth twitch/first twitch ( T4/T1 ) ratio 0.9 measure use Train Of Four ( TOF ) -Watch® SX , 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex administer 15 minute either bolus dose 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium last maintenance dose 0.15 mg/kg rocuronium .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relation Between TOF-Watch® SX Peripheral Nerve Stimulator After 4.0 mg.Kg-1 Sugammadex ( P05698 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The TOF-Watch® SX use neuromuscular monitoring clinical trial sugammadex . In clinical practice however , PNS commonly use many hospital worldwide . A disadvantage PNS objective monitoring like TOF-Watch® SX , detect number twitch . In trial , relationship time reappearance T4 use PNS ( i.e . Ministim® model MS-IV ) time recovery T4/T1 ratio 0.9 use TOF-Watch® SX determine dose 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex administer 15 minute last dose rocuronium . Determining relationship enable provision advice safe extubate participant administration 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex reverse neuromuscular block use PNS . The time reappearance T4 assess blind PNS-assessor . This assessor blind dose sugammadex use TOF result measure TOF-Watch® SX .</detailed_description>
