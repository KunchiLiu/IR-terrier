	<brief_title>SmartCPR Trial : An Analysis Waveform-Based Automated External Defibrillation ( AED ) Algorithm Survival From Out-of-Hospital Ventricular Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The delivery electrical shock , term defibrillation , long recognize one critical `` link '' `` Chain Survival '' follow out-of-hospital cardiac arrest . This particularly case patient present ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) , state constant yet uncoordinate fire low portion heart ( ventricle ) , ability treat patient defibrillation prior arrival hospital remain one reason group represent patient likely survive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest . Though technology successfully utilized prehospital set forty year , long-held belief `` immediate defibrillation '' optimal treatment patient come question . Following research do location Seattle , WA Oslo , Norway , come recognition patient ( particularly cardiac arrest 4-5 minute prior EMS arrival ) may actually benefit period CPR prior defibrillation ( `` delay defibrillation '' ) . This change take place within heart even level cell within heart follow onset VF . After several minute VF , cell within heart deprive deplete oxygen energy-containing molecule , build-up substance acid potassium . By provide CPR prior defibrillation , think patient 's heart may provide enough oxygen energy-containing molecule , make likely heart respond favorably defibrillation . Yet necessarily true VF patient . Other data patient whose collapse cardiac arrest witness defibrillation able provide quite rapidly ( i.e . airport , airplane , casino ) demonstrate high survival rate compare patient arrest longer period . This suggest patient best treat immediate defibrillation treat `` delayed defibrillation . '' The problem modern emergency medical service ( EMS ) system include determine VF begin , impact bystander CPR , patient 's overall condition time cardiac arrest , time interval 911 call arrival EMS provider ( EMTs paramedic ) side patient . By choose provide immediate defibrillation patient , hop benefit likely respond defibrillation survive , EMS system would simultaneously choose provide less ideal treatment patient likely benefit `` delayed defibrillation . '' Conversely , choose provide `` delayed defibrillation '' patient likely treat large percentage VF patient EMS system appropriately , yet potentially delay life-saving treatment likely survive ( patient would benefit immediate defibrillation ) . Research involve mathematic property VF waveform ( something human eye calculate ) lead development computer algorithm may predict , base calculate mathematical `` score '' VF , whether patient likely respond favorably immediate defibrillation delay defibrillation . Such technology could , therefore , seem able recommend every patient treatment best individual condition , would follow individual treatment may improve survival VF cardiac arrest overall . This study design examine effect technology VF patient present EMS provider New York , NY London , England .</detailed_description>
