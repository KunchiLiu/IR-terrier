	<brief_title>Study Measure Safety Paliperidone ER ( Extended-release ) Patients With Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder commonly condition may affect liver , alcohol abuse and/or chronic liver infection ( hepatitis ) . Although single-dose study patient liver disease conduct test safety medication , less information safety treatment medication schizophrenia at-risk population patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder liver disease . This 9-week study open-label ( patient investigator know study drug dose study drug patient take ) 2 phase . During Phase 1 , last 4 week , patient continue take whatever medication already take schizophrenia ( TAU , treatment usual ) . During first week Phase 2 , patient receive decrease dos TAU increase dos paliperidone ER . For rest Phase 2 , last 4 week , patient take paliperidone ER dose 3 mg/day 12 mg/day , prescribe study doctor .
