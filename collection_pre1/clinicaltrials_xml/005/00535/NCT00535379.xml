	<brief_title>SUTENT ( SUNITINIB , SU11248 ) Patients With Recurrent Progressive Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) common aggressive primary brain tumor adult show incidence 5/100.000 inhabitant per year1 . In Austria , approximately 350 patient diagnosed malignant glioma annually . Advances surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy minor impact natural course hardly treatable tumor . The mean survival time adult patient GBM 9-15 month time diagnosis1,2 . Thus , urgent need effective therapeutic approach base well molecular understanding tumor progression tumor neovascularization . Molecular Neurooncology begin elucidate complexity transform phenotype GBM goal identify important molecular change tumor cell may amenable targeted therapies3 . The elucidation growth factor receptor signal pathway responsible malignant phenotype translate molecular therapy . At present , targeted therapy small molecule inhibitor direct receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTKs ) downstream signal pathway seem promise therapeutic approach directly influence oncogenetically alter signal pathways4 . Imatinib Mesylate ( STI571 , Gleevec ) potent inhibitor Bcr-Abl , PDGFR-α/ß , c-Fms c-KIT tyrosine kinase . Its ability inhibit PDGFR signal suggest therapeutic potential malignant glioma , single-agent imatinib show minimal therapeutic activity5 . Erlotinib ( OSI-774 , Tarceva ) Gefitinib ( ZD1839 , Iressa ) potent inhibitor Epidermal-Growth-Factor-Receptor ( EGFR ) . However , inhibitor also demonstrate limited activity GBMs response rate 10 15 % significant prolongation survival6 . Tipifarnib ( R115777 , Zarnestra ) potent selective inhibitor farnesyl-transferase influence Ras oncogene pathway . Overexpression Ras implicate pathogenesis malignant glioma , also amplify receptor EGFR , PDGFR VEGFR lead downstream activation . Clinical trial inhibition Ras signal pathway show also limited biologic effect GBM patients7 . 3.2 . Rationale SUTENT treatment GBM Patients Reason limit activity selective target single agent , also chemotherapeutic treatment , GBM patient heterogeneity redundancy molecular pathway glioma cells8 . Therefore , multi-targeted therapy approach , inhibit multiple molecular signaling pathway involve tumor progression tumor neovascularization seem promising treatment strategy . SUTENT ( SUNITINIB , SU11248 ) potent multi-target inhibitor VEGFR1-3 , PDGFR-α/β , FLT3 , c-KIT , RET CSF-1R . This drug show good solubility , bioavailability protein-binding characteristics9 highly effective metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma ( MRCC ) 10-12 gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) 13,14 . The aggressiveness GBM reflect diffuse local infiltration brain parenchyma high tumor vascularization15,16 . Neuropathological hallmark GBMs pseudopalisades microvascular hyperplasia . Pseudopalisades characterize accumulation hypoxic tumor cell around central necrosis ( Fig . 3A ) , result increase metabolic demand tumor cell vascular occlusion . Such tumor cell express high level hypoxia-inducible regulator angiogenesis , include hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) -α. HIF-α accumulates tumor cell bind constitutively present partner HIF-β . The HIF complex lead transcription hypoxia-induced gene , VEGF PDGF17 . These growth factor secrete extracellular space tumor cell bind high-affinity receptor locate 1. tumor cell ( autocrine action ) , lead tumor cell proliferation survival , also stimulation HIF-α protein synthesis 2. endothelial cell , vascular smooth muscle cell pericytes ( paracrine action ) , lead tumor-related neoangiogenesis18-21 . Therefore , VEGF may induce microvascular hyperplasia ( Fig . 1B ) , typical form neoangiogenesis immediately related pseudopalisading cells16,22 . Since necrosis hypoxia locate GBM 's core , biologically relevant hypoxia-induced neovascularization occur peripherally , favour diffuse infiltration individual glioma cell allow peripheral GBM expansion . Summary molecular clinical rationale SUTENT treatment GBM patient - The target molecule SUTENT ( i.e . VEGFR , PDGFR , FLT-3 , c-KIT , RET ) strongly express GBM tissue crucial role tumor progression tumor neovascularization - The vascular density GBMs among high human neoplasm - Clinical study SUTENT demonstrate radiological response significant improvement progression free survival due SUTENT treatment MRCC Imatinib-resistant GIST - In clinical trial use SUTENT incidence severity adverse event laboratory abnormality relatively low ( MRCC GIST patient )</detailed_description>
