	<brief_summary>This study , conduct NIH Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) Phoenix Indian Medical Center , compare effect two method bariatric surgery , adjustable BAND Roux-en-Y gastric bypass , insulin . Bariatric surgery treatment achieve maintain weight loss . The study look surgery might improve insulin ( hormone important regulating blood sugar level ) make work body possible role change hormone produce gut ( stomach intestine ) . People 18 50 year age schedule either laparoscopic adjustable BAND Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery may eligible study . Candidates screen 4 6 week surgery medical history , blood test oral glucose tolerance test diabetes . Participants spend 4 day CRU 2 day overnight out-patient visit approximately 4 6 week surgery 3 6 week surgery . They return 4-6 hour visit CRU 6 month , 1 2 year surgery half-day outpatient visit 3 , 4 5 year surgery follow procedure : - Blood urine test , include pregnancy test woman . ( 4-day 2-day admission year , 3 , 4 5 ) - DEXA , x-ray scan determine body fat content . ( 4-day 2-day admission year , 3 , 4 5 ) - MRI scan measure fat tissue abdomen . ( 4-day 2-day admission year , 3 , 4 5 ) - Intravenous ( I.V . ) glucose tolerance test risk obesity diabetes . A sugar solution give needle vein one arm blood sample draw another needle vein arm . ( 4-day admission ) - Meal test measure blood sugar insulin gut hormone level meal . After I.V . line place arm vein , subject eats breakfast 20 minute . Blood sample collect halfway meal , end meal , 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 180 minute complete meal . Subjects fill questionnaire feeling hunger fullness , meal test . ( 4-day 2-day admission ) - Glucose clamp test measure effect body insulin give vein . An I.V line place vein arm vein hand side body . While insulin infuse one I.V. , blood sugar level check every 5 minute sugar solution give vein need . A radioactive sugar also infuse slowly 4 hour determine much sugar body produce . ( 4-day admission )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bariatric surgery treatment obesity , many case , also improve fast blood sugar level even patient type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) - within day week surgery . Both inability use insulin ( insulin resistance ) inability make enough insulin need ( impaired insulin secretion ) must present T2DM occur , report improve bariatric surgery . It generally think immediate improvement blood sugar level , include remission T2DM `` prediabetes '' many patient , follow bariatric surgery due markedly reduce intake calorie . However , know blood sugar level meal tend improve earlier great extent patient Roux en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) procedure patient either adjustable gastric banding ( BAND ) sleeve gastrectomy ( SG ) procedure . It propose surgical alteration gut subsequent re-routing food occur RYGB procedure result unique change gut pancreas ( organ secrete insulin ) respond food change also relate improved insulin resistance and/or secretion . The purpose protocol study , surgery , volunteer either normal impaired ( `` pre-diabetic '' ) blood sugar regulation approve undergo either elective RYGBP , BAND SG bariatric surgery ( n=16 per surgery group , total = 48 individual normal blood sugar ; n= 10 per surgery group , total = 30 individual prediabetes ) . The primary aim compare early effect BAND , SG RYGBP procedure : ) ability maintain blood sugar level , b ) much insulin make ( secretion ) work ( insulin action ) body , c ) responses gut pancreas hormone meal test significant weight loss occur surgery . To achieve goal , initially screen volunteer NIH Clinical Research Unit Phoenix approximately 4-6 week prior surgery ( 1-day outpatient visit ) determine oral glucose tolerance status ( OGTT ) . Within 3 week ( 1-4 week prior surgery ) , subject admit ( 4-day in-patient stay ) 2 day overnight stay outpatient ( 4-6 hour ) visit measure weight , body fatness ( DXA scan ) , waist circumference , insulin resistance , insulin secretion , fast blood sugar hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ; substance indicate well body keep overall blood sugar level normal range ) , plasma hormone response gut pancreas standard meal test . These measurement repeat 3-6 week follow surgery . Secondary aim : 1 ) compare long-term effect ( 5 year ) BAND , SG RYGBP surgery fast blood sugar HbA1c level , 2 ) determine level relate response gut pancreas hormone meal test , 3 ) determine whether pre-op early post-op measure insulin secretion , insulin action , responses gut pancreas hormone meal predict long-term level fast blood sugar HbA1c accounting change weight body fat . To achieve goal , subject return NIH CRU ( out-patient , 4-6 hour visit ) 6 , 12 , 24 month surgery repeat measurement body weight , fatness ( DXA , non-contrast MRI waist thigh ) , waist circumference , fast blood sugar HbA1c level gut pancreatic hormone response meal test . Thereafter , subject annual outpatient measurement body weight , body fat fast blood sugar HbA1c level 3 , 4 5 year surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects must initially qualify bariatric surgery accord current NIH guideline , require presence either morbid obesity alone ( BMI great 40 kg/m ( 2 ) ) BMI great 35 kg/m ( 2 ) along least 2 comorbidities . Patients condition sleep apnea , mild steatohepatitis , GERD , asthma ( require oral steroid ) osteoarthritis consider participation . Subject undiagnosed diabetes ( 2h glucose great 200 mg/dl initial screen OGTT ) include IGR group ONLY IF BOTH fast plasma glucose le 126 mg/dl HbA1c le 7 percent , suggest early T2DM . Subjects must least 18 year age less 150 kg body weight . Males females ethnic minority include . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Because indication bariatric surgery , many potential subject underlie comorbidities associate obesity . For protocol , subject exclude follow : Current smoking Previously diagnose diabetes Other endocrine disorder , Cushing 's disease , pituitary disorder , thyroid disease Significant hepatic renal disease ( ALT AST great 3fold upper limit normal range , cirrhosis , active hepatitis B C , serum creatinine great 1.5 mg/dl presence protein urine dipstick ) Active tuberculosis ( selfreport ) Major pulmonary disorder include physician diagnose chronic obstructive pulmonary disease obstructive sleep apnea Cardiovascular disease , include coronary heart disease , heart failure , arrhythmia , peripheral artery disease Hypertension ( accord World Health Organization diagnostic criterion ) , treat uncontrolled Gastrointestinal disease , include inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g . Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis ) , malabsorption syndrome ( e.g . celiac disease ) , gastric ulcer ( active ) Central nervous system disease , include previous history cerebrovascular accident , dementia , neurodegenerative disorder Cancer require treatment past five year , except nonmelanoma skin cancer cancer clearly cured opinion investigator carry excellent prognosis Psychiatric condition behavior current alcohol illicit drug use would incompatible safe successful participation study Recent use ( within 30 day ) anorexiant medication , antibiotic , contraceptive fertility drug recent use ( within 5 day ) anti inflammatory agent Pregnancy breastfeeding ( avoid radiation exposure fetus nursing infant )</criteria>
