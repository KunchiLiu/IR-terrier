	<brief_title>Trident® Tritanium™ Acetabular Shell Revision Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total hip replacement consider successful surgical procedure treatment degenerative joint disease . Clinical result cementless acetabular component demonstrate excellent long-term fixation device . However , call 'first generation ' cementless acetabular component similar success rate . In case acetabular component often revise due loosening , wear infection . Revision hip arthroplasty also become challenge patient often present severe bone loss poor bone quality . This lead compromise initial stability , turn lead lack long-term fixation failure . Acetabular revision cementless component show improved result cement fixation . Radiographic evaluation Trident® Tritanium™ Acetabular Shell provide valuable early intermediate information may help predict long-term success new system . It intention study closely follow subject undergone revision hip replacement regard implant survivorship , sign radiographic loosen , subject ' function evaluate Harris Hip Score Lower Extremity Activity Scale , subject quality life SF-36 adverse event . The primary efficacy hypothesis rate revision pending revision ( defined radiographic parameter ) due instability lack fixation Trident® Tritanium™ Acetabular Shell le 10 % 5 year .</detailed_description>
