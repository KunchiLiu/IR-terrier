	<brief_title>Group Based Exposure Therapy Combat-Related PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 250,000 veteran war-related PTSD treat VA system VA system last year . Although VA set 140 specialized PTSD program 206 Vet Centers treat veteran , survey practice pattern suggest VA PTSD treatment consistent publish treatment guideline . This mainly due rare use exposure therapy surprise consider empirical support exposure therapy PTSD treatment . The failure utilize evidence-based treatment may explain study generally fail support efficacy VA PTSD treatment . Group Based Exposure Therapy ( GBET ) consistent PTSD treatment guideline include large amount exposure therapy . An open trial 102 war veteran suggest GBET produce clinically significant last PTSD symptom reduction , measure Clinician Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) , large effect size 1.20 ( generalize ) . Clinically significant symptom reduction , define reduction total CAPS score 10 point , find 81 percent patient . These symptom reduction maintain 6-month post-treatment assessment patient . Self-report measure depression , anger , suicidal ideation PTSD also significantly reduce pre-treatment measure compare post-treatment score . This magnitude symptom change rarely report VA war-related PTSD patient low dropout rate ( &gt; 3 % ) . Caution use interpret unusual finding due treat clinician conduct study assessment . Unconscious bias desire patient please therapist may affect outcome . GBET 16-week program patient attend group therapy twice week three hour group per day require make two war trauma presentation group . These record patient require listen recording minimum 10 time . There generally 10 patient per group combination make presentation , listen recording presentation , hear presentation nine group member , 60 hour exposure . Patients learn PTSD symptom , sleep hygiene , specific stress/anger management technique , way cognitively restructure trauma-related thinking . Although finding encourage critical question remain generalizability GBET . The three primary question : 1 ) would similar outcome find rigorous test randomize control trial , 2 ) new psychotherapist produce similar outcome , 3 ) similar outcome find site . The propose study would take next step conduct first control trial 88 veteran war-related PTSD randomly assign either GBET Treatment Usual control condition ( 44 per condition ) . GBET treatment would provide four psychotherapist without prior GBET experience . Independent Assessors blind treatment condition would assess patient prior treatment , post-treatment , 6-months post-treatment one year post-treatment use CAPS standardized measure . If GBET support , multi-site study propose investigate third primary question . Potential Impact Veteran Health Care : GBET develop within specialized PTSD program , VA clinicians work war veteran primary mode treatment within program three year . Most VA PTSD program staff similar one develop GBET many staff . GBET manualized could adopt easily VA PTSD program Vet Centers . The propose study would serve feasibility study multi-site study . If multi-site study find GBET produce superior treatment outcome currently use , could direct impact live large number veteran lead well PTSD treatment within VA .</detailed_description>

Patients current history mania schizophrenia would exclude stress exposure therapy may precipitate increase symptom comorbid condition could interfere patient 's ability benefit treatment . 2 . Patients suffer current active psychosis , active mania , sufficient mental impairment , assess Mini Mental State Exam score 24 , would prevent patient provide valid consent participate safely understanding treatment . 3 . Patients current , prominent suicidal ideation . All patient would screen suicidal ideation intention RC initial screen IA initial assessment brief clinical interview . A BDI # 9 score 3 would prompt indepth inquiry concern suicidal thought intention initial assessment . 4 . Patients currently meet diagnostic criterion substance abuse dependence meet criterion previous three month ( measure clinical interview KreekMcHughSchlugerKellogg scale ( 50 ) ) .</criteria>
