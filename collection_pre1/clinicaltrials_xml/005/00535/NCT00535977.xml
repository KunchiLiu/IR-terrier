	<detailed_description>Cancer one main cause death among human world . Prostate cancer affect 20,000 men UK alone year . Diet known major factor influence risk cancer . Therefore , change diet may alter cancer risk . Cruciferous vegetable , particularly broccoli , provide diet substantial source plant chemical call glucosinolates . Previous research indicate glucosinolates break form isothiocyanate ( ITCs ) absorb body . Further research indicate ITCs may protect body development prostate cancer . However , mechanism behind effect fully understood . ITCs think powerful anti cancer agent modulate expression ( switch ) specific gene involve removal toxic substance carcinogens body . In study wish evaluate effect consumption conventionally breed cultivar broccoli contain high level ITCs gene expression prostate tissue gain well understand mechanism action . Several study suggest protection cancer amongst individual deletion certain gene . This pilot study comprise 12-month intervention either 400g ITC-enriched broccoli per week 400g garden pea men high risk develop prostate cancer . Changes gene expression prostate biopsy tissue compare 6 12 month intervention dietary group .</detailed_description>
