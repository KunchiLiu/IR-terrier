	<brief_title>NSCLC Relapse Therapy After Surgery Peri-operative Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As chemotherapy gain wider acceptance treatment earlier stage NSCLC , particularly adjuvant neoadjuvant setting , physician face grow population high performance status patient relapse first-line chemotherapy . The type second-line chemotherapy initial adjuvant neoadjuvant treatment platinum-based regimen remain largely undefined . Some might consider rechallenging patient platinum base doublet whereas others might treat patient monochemotherapy ( pemetrexed docetaxel ) . Most relapse occur perioperative chemotherapy surgery non surgical locally advanced relapse metastatic disease . Some difference exist post surgical relapse progression occur first line non surgical treatment stage III/IV . - Patients often good condition ( performance status 0-1 ) . - Progression often asymptomatic diagnose post surgical follow . - The dose chemotherapy previously administer low administer first line stage III/IV . - The time first line treatment treatment relapse longer . These difference might associate chemosensitive disease thus might rationale use platinum contain doublet instead classical mono chemotherapy docetaxel pemetrexed . Thus , current study design answer question .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients histologically cytologically confirm inoperable nonsmall celllung cancer eligible curative radiotherapy ( local metastatic relapse ) . Previous history adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( least 2 full cycle platinum contain regimen ) Initial stage pT1N0 pT3N2 ( TNM classification 1999 ) , complete resection . T4 tumour ( several nodule lobe ) M1 tumour ( several nodule lung ) N02 completely resect allow inclusion . Histological complete response tumour ( pT0N0 ) neoadjuvant chemotherapy allow inclusion . At least one unidimensionally measurable disease ( RECIST criterion ) ( lesion must clearly define margin Xray , CTscan , MRI ultrasound ( US ) examination measure least 1 cm assess CT , MRI US least 2 cm assess Xray , target lesion select outside previously irradiated field ) . PET scan ultra sonography allow ECOG Performance status 0 1 ) . Patients adequate biological function : Written inform consent patient . The effect docetaxel , cisplatin carboplatin develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason docetaxel , cisplatin carboplatin well therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Life expectancy &gt; 12 week Patient compliance geographic proximity allow adequate followup . Patient affiliate social insurance program Previous treatment docetaxel . Hypersensitivity docetaxel , cisplatin , carboplatin polysorbate 80 ( excipient ) . Previous history cancer Non small cell lung cancer , situ carcinoma uterine cervix basal cell carcinoma skin . Patients previously treat investigational agent last 30 day . Patient treat preoperative platin base chemotherapy , achieve progression disease treatment evaluation . Patients non responder preoperative chemotherapy whose tumor specimen disclose necrosis tumoral modification thus confirm lack chemosensitivity platin base chemotherapy Patient treat platin base adjuvant chemotherapy , relapse within first 6 month surgery . Patients peripheral neuropathy grade CTC &gt; = 2 Patients unable fulfill protocol requirement Serious concomitant morbidity incompatible study ( discretion investigator ) . Relapse within month follow lung cancer resection adjuvant chemotherapy Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Significant loss weight ( &gt; 10 % ) 6 week precede patient selection . Concomitant administration another anti cancer treatment Pregnant woman exclude study . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother , breastfeed discontinue . Patient legal protection .</criteria>
