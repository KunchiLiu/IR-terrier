	<detailed_description>Docetaxel drug design help kill cancer cell . Imatinib mesylate drug design block cancer cell grow divide . Hormonal treatment Lupron ( leuprolide ) Zoladex ( goserelin acetate ) use low testosterone level body prostate cancer cell need testosterone survive . All patient prostate gland remove treatment drug . Before treatment start , ask question medical history complete physical examination . You blood draw ( 2 tablespoon ) routine blood test . You ask question medication currently take take past . You electrocardiogram ( ECG - test measure electrical activity heart ) . As part standard care prostate cancer , also compute tomography ( CT ) scan ( magnetic resonance imaging ( ( MRI ) ) scan ) abdomen pelvis along bone scan ( x-rays bone ) see prostate cancer move part body . For study , receive hormone injection low level testosterone blood . You also take imatinib mesylate capsule mouth receive treatment docetaxel vein help kill cancer cell surgery . You receive hormone therapy either leuprolide goserelin acetate injection , whichever doctor feel give benefit . The hormone injection give every month every 3 month . During treatment hormone , also take anti-androgen drug call Casodex ( bicalutamide ) mouth 2 week . This drug use help decrease risk develop side effect due hormone injection ( standard care hormone treatment ) . You take imatinib mesylate capsule every day 6 week start hormone treatment . You also receive treatment docetaxel . Docetaxel injection give vein 60 minute week 4 week row . This follow 2 week docetaxel . This 6 week period consider course treatment . You 3 course treatment ( 18 week ) docetaxel . After treatment complete , prostate surgery within 4 week fully recover treatment . During treatment , general health monitor physical exam blood test ( 1-2 tablespoon ) often make sure tolerate treatment safely . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study doctor discus treatment option . Before surgery , give general anesthetic . An incision ( cut ) make abdomen ( low stomach area ) prostate gland lymph node pelvis remove . Before procedure , risk explain need sign separate consent form . After surgery , check-up visit every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month rest life . At visit , physical exam around 1-2 tablespoon blood collect routine lab test . If doctor feel necessary , may also CT scan , bone scan , and/or x-ray . These test do check cancer come back . If cancer come back , remove study doctor discus treatment option . This investigational study . The leuprolide goserelin acetate injection , bicalutamide tablet , imatinib mesylate capsule , docetaxel injection FDA approve commercially available . Up 36 participant take part study . All enrol UT MD Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
