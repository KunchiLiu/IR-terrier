	<brief_title>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillator Based Impedance Monitoring Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center feasibility study intend collect information change intra-thoracic impedance measurement CRT-D device . In order obtain intra-thoracic impedance measurement , device delivers subthreshold impulse measure resistance two electrode . At programmed interval , measurement obtain six different lead configuration .</detailed_description>
