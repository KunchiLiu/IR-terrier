	<brief_title>CAPTAIN : Choroidal Neovascularization Assessment Pattern Electroretinography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background 1.1 Pathophysiology Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) progressive disease cause irreversible visual impairment blindness nearly 50 million people globally 1 . 2 . Current estimate patient affect AMD higher affect Alzheimer 's disease 1.3 Although geographic atrophy neovascularization represent advance form AMD , neovascular AMD aggressive form account almost 90 % blindness disease . It characterize choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) development abnormal blood vessel underneath retina . Current treatment photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) intravitreal pegaptanib design limit visual loss , marginally effective 4-6 . 1.2 Treatment on-label naive AMD patient Recent randomize clinical trial ( Marina , Anchor ) conclusively demonstrate continued intravitreal therapy ranibizumab patient subfoveal CNV AMD lead stabilization vision 90 % patient improvement vision least third patient lead approval ranibizumab ( 0.5 mg ) treatment neovascular AMD . Naive patient use study determine improvement ERG determine without prior therapy . 1.3 Electroretinography ( ERG ) Effects Of Ranibizumab Therapy AMD trial typically design address visual acuity outcome design evaluate retinal function outcome . Global macular retinal index measure electroretinography ( ERG ) key indicator retinal health largely ignored clinical trial . 1.4 Non-Clinical Experience With Ranibizumab 1.4.1 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics ranibizumab investigate rabbit cynomolgus monkey follow intravitreal intravenous administration . In specie , follow intravitreal administration , ranibizumab clear vitreous humor half life 2-3 day . Following single intravitreal administration cynomolgus monkey , retinal concentration ranibizumab approximately one third vitreous concentration decline parallel vitreous concentration . In human , intravitreal half-life ranibizumab estimate 7-8 day . Repeated intravitreal injection ranibizumab lead detectable antibody serum rabbit cynomolgus monkey . 1.4.2 Nonclinical Toxicology A series nonclinical study ranibizumab administer intravitreal injection cynomolgus monkey perform ( detail regard study design result find Investigator Brochure ) . 1.4.3 Stability Studies The stability ranibizumab alone combination verteporfin assess vitro . The combination ranibizumab verteporfin 5 % dextrose solution concentration 500 mg/mL 1.4 mg/mL , respectively , result ranibizumab degradation decrease ranibizumab capacity bind VEGF . The ranibizumab degradation product fully characterize . Although currently unknown degradation also occur vivo , sequential administration verteporfin follow ranibizumab intervene washout period decrease likelihood loss ranibizumab activity degradation . 1.5 Clinical Experience With Ranibizumab Ranibizumab clinically evaluate nine study ( additional detail regard study design result find Investigator Brochure ) . The first clinical trial ranibizumab , Study FVF1770g Phase Ia study molecule give single intravitreal injection subject neovascular AMD . The goal study investigate safety tolerability define maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) . The single intravitreal MTD determine 0.5 mg ( limited ocular inflammation ) . The Phase I/II study FVF2128g first clinical trial multiple-dose regimen intravitreally administer ranibizumab . Sixty-four subject enrol study . Data show ranibizumab safe potentially efficacious subject subfoveal choroidal neovascularization due AMD . Study FVF2425g Phase I , open-label , randomize study three escalate multiple dose regimen intravitreally administer ranibizumab . Data show dose ranibizumab 2 mg could safely give part escalate dose regimen subject subfoveal choroidal neovascularization due AMD . Study FVF2428g Phase I/II , single mask , multicenter study safety , tolerability , efficacy multiple dose intravitreal injection ranibizumab combination verteporfin PDT subject neovascular AMD . Data show combination ranibizumab verteporfin PDT good safety profile study population , efficacy ranibizumab verteporfin PDT good verteporfin PDT alone . Preliminary finding Study FVF2428g suggest administration ranibizumab injection 7 day ( plus/minus 2 day ) treatment verteporfin PDT eye may result decrease visual acuity 30 letter due temporary intraocular inflammation ( uveitis ) . Study FVF2508g ongoing Phase I extension study design ass safety tolerability multiple-dose intravitreal injection ranibizumab administer monthly subject complete treatment phase Genentech-sponsored Phase I study . Study FVF2587g ongoing Phase III active treatment-controlled study design ass efficacy safety intravitreal administer ranibizumab compare verteporfin subject angiographically determine , predominantly classic subfoveal neovascular AMD . Study FVF2598g ongoing Phase III study design assess efficacy safety intravitreal injection ranibizumab administer monthly compare sham injection administer monthly subject angiographically determine , minimally classic occult subfoveal neovascular AMD . Data show ranibizumab safe efficacious subject subfoveal CNV due AMD . Study FVF3192g ongoing Phase IIIb study design assess efficacy safety intravitreal injection ranibizumab administer three monthly injection follow quarterly injection total duration 24 month , subject angiographically determine subfoveal neovascular AMD without classic CNV . Study 3426g ongoing open-label extension study design ass safety tolerability intravitreal injection ranibizumab subject complete treatment phase Genentech-sponsored ranibizumab study . Study 3689g ongoing Phase IIIb , 1 year multicenter study safety tolerability intravitreally administer ranibizumab two different dos ( 0.3mg 0.5mg ) subject active subfoveal CNV secondary AMD , administer month 3 month thereafter need , base criteria-based re-treatment option . 2 . Objectives 2.1 Primary Objective To determine improvement retinal function determine pattern full-field ERG follow treatment ranibizumab AMD 2.2 Secondary Objectives To determine correlation improvement visual acuity retinal function determine ERG Visual acuity 6 month 3 . Study Design 3.1 Description Of The Study This open-label , Phase I single arm study intravitreally administer ranibizumab on-label treatment naive patient follow assessment retinal function use ERG . Consented , enrol subject receive monthly open-label intravitreal injection 0.5 mg ranibizumab administer every month 6 month . ERG perform baseline , 1 month , 3 month 6 month . Electroretinograms record use DTL fiber electrode moisten carboxymethyl-cellulose sodium 1 % lie inferior fornix eye . Each DTL fiber lay along top low eyelid contact inferior cornea . Fibers anchor small adhesive pad near inner outer canthus . A reference electrode apply adhesive paste lateral outer canthus . An adhesive electrode place forehead serve ground . Prior pupil dilation , PERG responses record , include P50 ( derive macular photoreceptors ) N95 ( post-photoreceptor , include optic nerve ) , response alternate checkerboard pattern . Pupils dilate tropicamide 1 % phenylephrine hydrochloride 2.5 % full-field ERG PhNR recording . The patient dark-adapted 30 minute . For full-field recording , stimuli brief white flash present Ganzfeld integrate sphere . Responses dim bright flash record scotopic condition , a- b-wave amplitude note . Patients light adapt ten minute . Responses bright flash 30 Hz flicker response record photopic condition . A- b-wave amplitude implicit time note . Finally , photopic negative response ( PhNR ) record red flash blue background . 3.2 Rationale For Study Design Per package insert , naive AMD patient receive monthly injection Lucentis part usual care . 3.3 Outcome Measures 3.3.1 Primary Outcome Measures Percent patient Improvement ERG baseline 6 month base international standard ( determine expert reader ) . 3.3.2 Secondary Outcome Measures Percent patient Improvement ERG baseline 3 month base international standard ( determine expert reader ) Correlation change PERG mean change VA 6 month Mean change VA baseline 3 month 6 month . 3.4 Safety Plan There safety issue associate ERG . All safety monitor standard care use on-label ranibizumab . ERG test non-invasive . 3.5 Compliance With Laws And Regulations This study conduct accordance current U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs ) , local ethical legal requirement .</detailed_description>
