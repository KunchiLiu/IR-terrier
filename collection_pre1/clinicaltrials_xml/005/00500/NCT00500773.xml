	<detailed_description>Regular exercise lead improvement cardiovascular risc factor patient coronary heart disease , atherosclerosis metabolic disorder . Aerobic exercise anti-inflammatory effect . In contrast , exertional exercise marathon run cause acute pro-inflammatory impulse . This may lead myocardial injury , case preexist plaque , may result plaque rupture acute myocardial infarction . The researcher aim define critical role inflammatory marker cardiovascular risk factor predictor increase risk myocardial endothelial dysfunction marathon runner . The study group divide average trained runner ( 40 km/week ) , average trained obese runner highly trained runner ( &gt; 70km/week ) . Training programme supervise professional coach . Individual scientific marathon contest organize assessment . Diagnostic tool include measurement pulse wave velocity heart rate turbulence , echocardiography , first time , MRI-scans pre- post marathon run . Additionally , cardiovascular marker endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) adiponectin measure . Inflammatory marker include c-reactive protein ( CRP ) , interleukins tumor necrosis factor .</detailed_description>
