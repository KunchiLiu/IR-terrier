	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study compare carboplatin cyclophosphamide give etoposide , vincristine , radiation therapy treatment choroid plexus tumor . The safety 2 combination therapy also compare . Objectives : OVERALL AIM : To improve choroid plexus tumor treatment well understanding tumor biology increase knowledge benefit specific treatment element . Specific Objectives : The study prephase evaluate feasibility follow randomize study ( main phase ) . Pre-Phase ( complete 2005 ) Primary Specific Objective : To determine number patient accountable per year randomization worldwide study . Secondary Specific Objective : To measure number drop out describe toxicity chemotherapy . Main Phase ( started 2006 ) Primary Specific Objective : To compare survival time cyclophosphamide base treatment survival time carboplatin base treatment choroid plexus tumor patient . Main Phase Secondary Specific Objectives : 1 . To compare resectability choroid plexus tumor two block cyclophosphamide base treatment resectability two block carboplatin base treatment . 2 . To compare response rate incompletely resect choroid plexus tumor two block cyclophosphamide base treatment response rate two block carboplatin base treatment . 3 . To determine prognostic relevance histological atypia SV40 choroid plexus tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tumors choroid plexus epithelium rare . Participants study surgery remove much brain tumor possible . Taking much tumor surgery generally believe best result disease . Some participant may even second surgery remove tumor think necessary . After tumor surgery , exact treatment participant study depend much tumor remove surgery way tumor tissue look microscope . Some participant require additional treatment tumor take . Those participant still study , observation receive additional treatment . Those require additional treatment randomly assign ( toss coin ) one 2 treatment group equal chance assign either group . Chemotherapy ( treatment anti-cancer drug ) give part treatment participant whose tumor completely remove surgically . Participants one group receive carboplatin plus etoposide , vincristine , radiation therapy . Participants group receive cyclophosphamide plus etoposide , vincristine , radiation therapy . Among known drug cancer , etoposide , vincristine , cyclophosphamide , platinum drug effective brain tumor . Carboplatin use few side effect relate hear occur later . This study also use radiation therapy surgery child young 3 year old . Normally , chemotherapy use delay radiation therapy child old concern side effect . This change make poor result achieve chemotherapy use delay radiation therapy . Chemotherapy one additional treatment participant 3 year age receive study . After first 2 cycle , response evaluate , include exam do screen continue treatment , need . Further surgery consider exams . If doctor choose consider surgery agree procedure next appropriate step , may undergo second surgery remove anymore remain tumor . After second surgery , chemotherapy continue schedule 4 cycle . If require surgery , continue chemotherapy previously plan . For participant old 3 year age , radiation therapy part treatment . It give second cycle chemotherapy . Participants receive radiation per day , five day per week , period 6 week . Most participant need stay hospital time . This follow 6 cycle chemotherapy . After 6 cycle chemotherapy , surgery consider . While radiation treatment , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test 2 time week . Before finish radiation , another blood test ( 2-3 teaspoon ) take monitor kidney liver function , well measure level hormone . You physical exam , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test cycle treatment . Participants carboplatin group receive etoposide 1 hour Days 1-5 , carboplatin 2 hour Days 2 3 , vincristine 15 minute Day 5 . This repeat every 4 week 24 week . Each period 4 week consider 1 cycle treatment . Participants cyclophosphamide group receive etoposide 1 hour Days 1-5 , cyclophosphamide 1 hour Days 2 3 , vincristine 15 minute Day 5 . This repeat every 4 week 6 cycle ( 24 week ) treatment . Mesna , drug protect bladder effect cyclophosphamide , give 15 minute dose cyclophosphamide . The chemotherapy give study cause white blood cell count low . White blood cell infection-fighting cell . If white blood cell count low long , participant group may give drug call G-CSF ( filgrastim ) . Filgrastim growth factor naturally produce body increase production white blood cell . Filgrastim give shot skin start Day 9 start chemotherapy . The total length treatment receive 7 month , able complete cycle additional treatment . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur , doctor discus treatment option . After complete treatment , follow-up visit every 3 month first year . Every 6 month still visit doctor 4 year complete treatment . You continue follow-up visit every year monitor sign disease come back , long would agree allow follow-up visit . At visit , routine blood test ( 2-3 teaspoon ) , check hormone level , measurement growth , hear test . The effect radiation/chemotherapy brain function , ability learn , quality life measure . You MRI brain , know metastatic site , spine . Your body height body weight measure . About 2 teaspoon blood drawn routine test . Your urine test presence blood . You spinal tap look cancer cell spinal fluid . Your hormone level also take see sign metabolic disorder growth deficiency . This do blood test require extra blood sample . This investigational study . All drug use study FDA approve commercially available . Their use together study experimental . A total 100 patient take part multicenter study . Up 5 enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
