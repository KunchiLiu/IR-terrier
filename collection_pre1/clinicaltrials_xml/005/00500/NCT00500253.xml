	<brief_summary>The aim study assess utility exhale nitric oxide measurement ( FeNO ) treatment monitor child asthma . According aim study follow assumption formulate : 1 . Comparison annual cumulative steroid dose , number bronchodilator dose take , number asthma exacerbation , number hospitalisation due asthma , group child asthma FeNO monitor treatment ( study group ) , group child treatment monitor GINA 's grade disease clinical control ( control group ) 2 . Assessment corelation FeNO ( ppb ) symptom score ( point ) lung function ( FEV1 ) 3 . Comparison value non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness methacholine ( PC20M ) study group 12. month treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Utility Exhaled Nitric Oxide Measurement Treatment Monitoring Children With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma one common chronic disease worldwide , impose substantial social burden child adult . What need kept mind , especially assess treatment effect allergic inflammation child asthma , symptom score spirometry measure limitation , mainly subjectivity ( symptom score ) , wide variability , lack stability short time period ( symptom score spirometry measure ) . Monitoring allergic inflammation course asthma child exhale nitric oxide measurement ( FeNO ) may allow titrate dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids precisely , depend individual patient requirement . The aim study assess utility FeNO treatment monitor child asthma . According aim study follow assumption formulate : 1 . Comparison annual cumulative steroid dose , number bronchodilator dose take , number asthma exacerbation , number hospitalisation due asthma , group child asthma FeNO monitor treatment ( study group ) , group child treatment monitor GINA 's grade disease clinical control ( control group ) 2 . Assessment corelation FeNO ( ppb ) symptom score ( point ) lung function ( FEV1 ) 3 . Comparison value non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness methacholine ( PC20M ) study group 12. month treatment .</detailed_description>
