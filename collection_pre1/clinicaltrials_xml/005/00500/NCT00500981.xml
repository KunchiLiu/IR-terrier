	<brief_title>Internal Jugular Vein Ultrasound Measures Fluid Responsiveness Post-Operative Cardiac Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The optimal therapy numerous disease state involve replenishment intravascular volume . Unfortunately , current clinical measure volume status imperfect . Given biologic plausibility preliminary study , possible static and/or dynamic measure internal jugular vein ( IJV ) size may correlate volume status and/or associate volume responsiveness . If , type assessment might ideal clinical volume-assessment tool . This pilot study aim establish proof concept via evaluation question patient follow cardiac surgery . This prospective observational study physiologically-stable , ventilated patient post-cardiac surgery . The primary objective study evaluate relationship static size right IJV fluid responsiveness ventilate post-operative cardiac surgical patient . A secondary objective evaluate relationship dynamic variation size right IJV related respiration leg-raising fluid responsiveness group . Static dynamic ultrasound measurement right IJV perform pre-volume challenge . Volume responsiveness independently assess cardiac index measurement rapid infusion 10 % pentastarch . 30 subject recruit pre-operatively informed consent obtain . Stability sedation , mechanical ventilation , hemodynamics assure prior initiation measurement . Baseline static respiratory dynamic ultrasound measurement right IJV obtain repeated bilateral leg-raising . Baseline hemodynamics cardiac output obtain use indwell pulmonary artery catheter . A standardized volume challenge 10 % pentastarch give 15 minute provide followed repeat hemodynamic cardiac output measurement . Offline measurement IJV size obtain unmodified stored video loop single observer blind patient identity , hemodynamic , fluid response data . Fluid responsiveness assess examine change cardiac index volume challenge fluid responsive state define increase â‰¥ 12 % cardiac index volume challenge . The relationship volume responsiveness IJ ultrasound measure evaluate continuously dichotomously .</detailed_description>
