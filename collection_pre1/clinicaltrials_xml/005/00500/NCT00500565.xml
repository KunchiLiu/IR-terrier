	<brief_summary>The objective pilot study examine efficacy ON~Q Pain Relief System plus Intravenous Patient Controlled Analgesia ( IVPCA ) Morphine v IV PCA alone patient undergo free transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous ( TRAM ) flap surgery . The primary outcome measure postoperative opioid analgesia requirement . Other outcome also assess , include pain score , quality recovery , resource utilization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inadequate control surgical pain free TRAM procedure may lead complication delay recovery time . This could lead long stay hospital . The standard care pain free TRAM procedure drug anesthetic . Unfortunately , anesthetic long lasting usually require use opioids ( morphine hydromorphone ) control `` break-through '' pain . A continuous delivery local anesthetic wound site may provide good control pain decrease need use opioids . This may decrease length hospital stay well side effect associate treatment pain . Before study , ask question health , age , allergy may . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . You already schedule undergo free TRAM flap procedure . During free TRAM flap procedure , two `` soaker catheter '' place surgeon directly surgical site . The catheter flexible tube allow pain medicine ( saline ) deliver directly donor wound site abdominal site tissue breast reconstruction take . A small pump ( On-Q pump ) connect catheter deliver constant flow pain medicine ( saline ) 5 day . The On-Q pump completely portable attached hospital gown allow movement . You randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two group . Participants first group On-Q pump fill saline . Participants group On-Q pump fill bupivicaine . Participants group receive IVPCA , standard care pain relief . The IVPCA place PRN mode mean able press button deliver pain medication whenever feel pain . You ask question pain recovery process every 6 hour awake 5 day . You also ask fill questionnaire pain day treatment . It take around 10 minute complete questionnaire . The catheter remove 5 day treatment ( last day hospital , whichever sooner ) one surgeon participate surgery During study , experience intolerable side effect doctor feel best interest stop treatment , take study treatment option discuss . This investigational study . The On-Q device , PCA , bupivicaine FDA approve commercially available . Up 60 participant take part study ( 30 group ) . All enrol The University Texas ( UT ) MD Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) . This protocol partially fund research grant I-Flow Corporation .</detailed_description>
