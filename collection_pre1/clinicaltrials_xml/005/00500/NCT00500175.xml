	<brief_summary>More half low extremity amputation person diabetes . These patient suffer severe , diabetes-induced , peripheral , sensory neuropathy , thus frequently protect foot repetitive shear stress traumatic episode ulceration often ensue . We previously show temperature profile plantar aspect foot provide reliable warn tissue injury effectively use preventive modality . In study propose develop clinically test novel infrared-based temperature instrument ( TempTouchRM® ) intend home use high-risk diabetic patient . This step-on remote monitoring device serve early warn system impend ulcer Charcot fracture . The study ’ central hypothesis TempTouchRM device reduce incidence ulcer provide accurate , simple , effective approach monitor change foot temperature .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study ’ central hypothesis TempTouchRM device reduce incidence ulcer provide accurate , simple , effective approach monitor change foot temperature . To study hypothesis , follow specific aim propose : Aim 1 : To develop , validate implement software protocols follow : ( ) data acquisition processing , ( ii ) physician-TempTouchRM communication interface . A state-of-the-art web interface develop allow clinician view store data patient . Aim 2 : To evaluate effectiveness TempTouchRM reduce incidence diabetic foot ulcer among high-risk patient . Our hypothesis patient monitor TempTouchRM few foot ulcer ulcer less severe . The 110 patient study comprise two treatment arm : standard therapy group enhance therapy group The latter receive standard care plus infrared temperature monitor use TempTouchRM daily 12 month . Elevated temperature provide information physician prevention practice initiate , off-loading , skin care , etc . Aim 3 : To determine normal range temperature variation individual foot patient Enhanced Therapy correlate deviation range incidence ulcer . Our previous study use contralateral foot control detect abnormal temperature . We investigate hypothesis proper trend normal foot temperature , individual foot serve control predict ulcer .</detailed_description>
