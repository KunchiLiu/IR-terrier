	<detailed_description>Meniere 's disease characterize recurrent attack vertigo , fluctuate hearing loss tinnitus , common disease incidence 15-50 per 100,000 population . Some patient Meniere 's disease strongly prevent participating activity daily life interaction social environment , work schooling , due frequent attack vertigo especially progressive sensorineural hearing loss , spite various kind medication . This type Meniere ’ disease call intractable Meniere ’ disease . Although oto-pathology Meniere ’ temporal bone reveal 1938 inner ear endolymphatic hydrops , definitive pathogenesis Meniere ’ disease still unknown radical treatment disease . It , however , report Meniere 's disease usually trigger immune , metabolic , infectious , traumatic insult inner ear , associate small misplace malfunction endolymphatic sac . Among insults , immune-mediated response inner ear endo-organs endolymphatic sac , stria vascularis spiral ligament , think main reason development symptom Meniere ’ disease . Thus , systemic administration and/or local perfusion corticosteroid middle ear adopt anti-immune anti-inflammatory therapy patient intractable Meniere 's disease . These treatment report result good relief vertigo improvement hearing case . However , result especially hear last long enough discontinue additional repetitive application steroid . Since Meniere 's disease characterize repeated attack vertigo fluctuate and/or progressive hearing loss unlike inner ear disease without recurrence sudden deafness vestibular neuritis , necessary refrain repetitive application steroid long-term follow-up Meniere 's patient side effect . For inner ear drug delivery , note another hopeful unevaluated route , longitudinal route endolymphatic sac cochlea vestibule , suggest several line evidence animal study . Morgenstern et al . Lee et al . demonstrate intra-endolymphatic sac material could reach cochlear endolymphatic site vestibular aqueduct use test marker oto-toxic drug , respectively . Recently , Yamasoba et al . suggest possibility gene therapy vestibular aqueduct route . We also reveal intra-endolymphatic sac steroid could up-regulate water channel molecule , aquaporin-3 mRNA cochlea . In present study , examine intra-endolymphatic sac application large dos steroid de novo treatment intractable Meniere 's disease .</detailed_description>
