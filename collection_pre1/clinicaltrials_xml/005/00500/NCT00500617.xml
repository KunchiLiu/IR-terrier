	<brief_summary>Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease ( CAD ) common cause morbidity mortality worldwide . CAD precipitate complex interaction genetic environmental factor . Establishing diagnosis CAD myocardial infarction death critically important . However , diagnosis CAD significant challenge , current non-invasive modality often yield indeterminate result . There several biologically base theory atherogenesis related plaque development arterial wall . The aim study identify genetic biological marker distinguish patient CAD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose PREDICT study develop validate diagnostic blood Assay atherosclerotic coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . The Assay use quantitative real-time PCR ( RT-PCR ) quantify expression multiple gene circulate peripheral blood cell assess presence clinically significant CAD patient . This prospective , multi-center , observational study . Participation study alter clinical care . The procedure require protocol collection research blood sample . All data collect accordance participate institution 's standard patient care . The study divide four sequential segment unique subject goal : gene discovery ( segment 1 ) , Assay development ( segment 2 ) , Assay validation ( segment 3 ) , additional Assay testing ( segment 4 ) . The primary analysis perform third segment study use subset enrolled subject ( `` primary subject '' ) . Primary subject define additional eligibility criterion beyond general eligibility criterion require enrollment overall study . The additional , post-enrollment eligibility criterion base clinical demographic factor find course study affect expression gene use Assay . Such factor identify gene discovery algorithm development . The post-enrollment eligibility criterion define prior begin Assay validation segment study . In addition , three substudies plan enroll 1500 subject . - The first substudy include subject undergoing cardiac CT angiography ( CTA ) aim determine gene expression correlate total coronary atheroma burden , measure CTA . - The second substudy examines sample handle shipping condition affect treatment subject . - The third substudy focus additional algorithm development validation non-diabetic female patient population .</detailed_description>
