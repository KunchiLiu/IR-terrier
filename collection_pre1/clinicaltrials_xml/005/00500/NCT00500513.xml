	<brief_summary>Objectives : - To determine safety fiducial implantation . - To determine extent/rate migration radio-opaque fiducials place lung tumor adjacent normal tissue . - To compare real-time portal imaging-based fiducial track measurement three-dimensional motion four-dimensional CT scan determine many fiducials need track tumor . - To determine intra-fractional lung tumor motion change course treatment , treatment occurs . - To correlate position internal fiducials position external patient surface respiration . - To quantify residual motion clinical target volume radiotherapy gate use external fiducials . - To verify adequacy treatment portal margin encompass residual motion clinical target volume . - To determine radio-opaque fiducial placement adjacent trachea ( move ) reduce daily setup inaccuracy , spare normal tissue . - To determine motion hilar adenopathy ( ) , whether correlate motion primary tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If eligible take part study , pulmonary ( lung ) function test . This test involve breathe mouthpiece measure amount air breathe . This provide information well lungs work , chest wall move breathe . You begin normal treatment planning process . A bean-bag `` cast '' make lie plan treatment . This do low day-to-day change position . A CT scan take breathe quietly , possibly several X-rays perform well . You mark magic marker , possibly several permanent tattoo place help daily positioning . These procedure normally take 1-2 hour . Small metal marker ( 5 ) place near tumor . A thin , flexible tube camera , call bronchoscope , use place marker lung . You give sedative one vein local anesthetic spray nose mouth introduce bronchoscope . The bronchoscope introduce one nostril pass windpipe bronchial tube . This allow doctor examine lung place small metal marker . These marker use track tumor treatment . In way radiation treatment give tumor even move breathe . You also study measure much tumor move . This do several additional CT scan , typically take weekly basis . Additional pulmonary function measurement take CT scan . These measurement allow researcher monitor movement tumor breathe . These procedure normally take 1 2 hour . You study duration radiation treatment . You follow additional 4 - 6 week make sure complication study . THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY . A total 30 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Patient must undergo radiation treatment . 2 . Planned course radiation treatment must great equal 6 week . 3 . The patient able tolerate bronchoscopy : . Able maintain oxygen saturation &gt; 95 % room air nasal cannula supplementation &lt; 5L/min , b . Can tolerate supine position without respiratory difficulty , c. Has normal hemodynamic parameter , d. Has normal coagulation profile 4 . The patient candidate bronchogenic placement seed . 5 . The patient identifiable tumor CT scan . 6 . The patient sign consent form . 1 . The patient previous thoracic surgery ( e.g. , lobectomy , pneumonectomy , tumor excision ) . Biopsy , mediastinoscopy , mastectomy exclusion . 2 . The patient previous radiation thorax .</criteria>
