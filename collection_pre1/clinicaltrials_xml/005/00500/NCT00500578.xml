	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To determine whether aerosolized ribavirin effective give intermittent dose 3 hour every 8 hour therapy RSV upper respiratory tract infection ( URI ) whether prevent progression pneumonia . 2 . To determine effect regimen persistence viral shedding .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intermittent Use Aerosolized Ribavirin Treatment RSV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ribavirin drug normally give treat upper respiratory infection cause RSV . The drug effective inhaled aerosol . This treatment require patient tent inhale medication . The usual method administer drug inhale medication continuously 18 hour . In study , total dose medication use , however , treatment 3 hour every 8 hour . As part standard care , treatment blood drawn ( around 2 teaspoon ) routine blood test . You wash throat nose collect . For procedure , around 1 teaspoon saline spray nostril blow nose cup . You swab nose throat . You also chest x-ray check status disease . Women able child must negative blood urine pregnancy test . Before treatment , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two group . Participants one group receive treatment ribavirin 3 hour every 8 hour . Participants group receive treatment use standard treatment schedule , ribavirin 18 hour every 24 hour . For group , drug administer aerosol use face mask . This require tent receive therapy . Treatment last 5 10 day . This require hospitalization . In addition ribavirin treatment , also receive Xopenex inhalation therapy every 6 - 8 hour . Xopenex drug design make breathe easy . We may need use another breathing treatment , albuterol inhalation therapy one time need , directly receive ribavirin make breathe easy . Every 2-4 day treatment blood collect ( around 2 teaspoon ) routine test . On Days 3 7 treatment ( +/- 2 day ) , repeat throat nose washings/swabs . The washing swab repeat week 2 week , 2 consecutive culture negative , occurs sooner . If doctor feel necessary , may repeat chest x-ray . If time develop sign pneumonia , remove study treat standard schedule ribavirin continuous inhalation and/or therapy 18 hour day . Also , develop intolerable side effect , take study doctor discus treatment option . This investigational study . Ribavirin FDA approve commercially available . However , method administration ribavirin investigational . Up 50 patient participate study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
