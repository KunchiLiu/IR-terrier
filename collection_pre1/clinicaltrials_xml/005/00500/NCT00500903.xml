	<brief_title>A Study MLN8237 , Novel Aurora A Kinase Inhibitor , Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multicenter , dose escalation , phase 1 study MLN8237 adult patient advance solid tumor . This study first administer MLN8237 human . MLN8237 give daily 7 21 consecutive day follow 14-day recovery period ( cycle length = 21 35 day ) . Patients continue receive repeat cycle MLN8237 long disease progress experienced unacceptable MLN8237-related toxicity . The dose MLN8237 increase successive cohort 3 6 patient maximum tolerate dose MLN8237 identify . Once maximum tolerate dose identified 7 consecutive day treatment , total 9 12 patient treat dose good define safety , PK , pharmacodynamics . Longer period dose MLN8237 evaluate , increase 7 14 day , , feasible , 21 day . Intermediate length dose may also evaluate . A 14-day recovery period follow dose period regardless duration .</detailed_description>

Patients treat fully human monoclonal antibody must receive treatment antibody least 6 week , treat chimeric monoclonal antibody must receive treatment antibody least 4 week . Patients treat noncytotoxic small molecule drug ( eg , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , Tarceva® , hormonal agent , Femara® ) must receive treatment drug least 2 week first dose MLN8237 give . Male patient must use appropriate method barrier contraception ( eg , condom ) inform sexual partner must also use reliable method contraception ( eg , birth control pill ) time inform consent 3 month last dose study treatment . Female patient must postmenopausal , surgically sterilize , willing use reliable method birth control ( eg , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , abstinence ) inform male sexual partner must also use reliable method contraception ( eg , condom ) time inform consent 3 month last dose study treatment .

Examples include limited partial gastrectomy , history small intestine surgery , celiac disease . History uncontrolled sleep apnea syndrome condition could result excessive daytime sleepiness , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Difficulty swallow capsule Inability take nothing mouth except water prescribe medication 2 hour 1 hour dose MLN8237 Received 4 previous cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimen include regimen use adjuvant neoadjuvant therapy . There limit number noncytotoxic therapy ( eg , hormonal immunologic ) patient may receive . Tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( eg , Tarceva Iressa® ) consider noncytotoxic compound .
