	<brief_summary>This multi-center , randomize , placebo-controlled , time-lagged , parallel-group study healthy hypertensive subject evaluate safety tolerability vaccine CYT006-AngQb . The trial double-blind active vs. placebo within treatment arm , open respect AngQb dose escalation . In first arm , 16 healthy normotensive volunteer treat one dose regimen consist single s.c. injection 100µg AngQb placebo . Upon satisfy safety tolerability profile , judge independent safety monitor board , arm two enrol . In arm two 36 patient mild moderate hypertension receive three s.c. injection 100µg CYT006-AngQb ( 24 patient ) placebo ( 12 patient ) . The second third injection give 4 12 week first injection , respectively . Upon satisfy safety tolerability profile , judge independent safety monitor board , arm three enrol . In arm three 36 patient mild moderate hypertension receive three s.c. injection 300µg CYT006-AngQb ( 24 patient ) placebo ( 12 patient ) . The second third injection give 4 12 week first injection , respectively . The primary objective trial evaluate safety / tolerability 3 dose regimen CYT006-AngQb healthy volunteer patient mild moderate essential hypertension . Secondary objective include assessment pharmacodynamic effect dose-response ( immunogenicity biomarkers renin-angiotensin system ) , exploration clinical efficacy ( effect systolic diastolic blood pressure )</brief_summary>
