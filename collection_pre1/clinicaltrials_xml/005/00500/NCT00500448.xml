	<brief_summary>Patients knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) often decrease thigh muscle strength . This muscle weakness think originate center brain spinal cord restrict recruitment fiber responsible muscle contraction . An inability fully contract muscle surround knee joint impairs patient ' ability perform activity daily live ( i.e . walking , climb stair ) may even contribute joint degeneration . Establishing therapy aim increase muscle strength , restore normal function , possibly slow process involve development knee OA essential order enhance quality life adult population plague degenerative joint condition . Electrical muscle stimulation apply thigh promising therapy show successfully restore muscle strength , however long treatment last influence functional outcome remain unknown . In order electrical muscle stimulation value must result sustained improvement muscle strength functional outcome . Therefore , purpose propose investigation determine electrical muscle stimulation restore thigh muscle strength improve functional outcome patient knee osteoarthritis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A frequent clinical obstacle encounter patient knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) inability achieve full voluntary activation quadriceps musculature . This phenomenon term arthrogenic muscle inhibition ( AMI ) ongoing reflex inhibition musculature surround joint follow distension damage structure joint . AMI limit factor joint rehabilitation restrict full muscle activation therefore prevents restoration strength . Thus , patient often participate life activity deficient strength neuromuscular control result alter low extremity mechanic potentially predispose patient joint degeneration . Neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) show successful reverse quadriceps AMI , however duration effectiveness influence functional outcome remain elusive . Therefore , purpose propose study examine quadriceps activation functional outcome follow 4-week NMES protocol patient medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis . To examine efficacy NMES reverse AMI improve functional outcome , 38 subject randomly assign either undergo 4-week NMES program undergo therapeutic intervention . Prior treatment 1 , 12 , 24 week follow treatment , patient ' quadriceps central activation ratio assess . Additionally , subject undergo gait stair climb analyse determine functional performance activity daily live improve compare baseline assessment . Patients ' perceive level function also test use Western Ontario McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index .</detailed_description>
