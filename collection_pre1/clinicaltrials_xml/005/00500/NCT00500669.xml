	<brief_title>A Randomised Study Assess Betadine Groin Wound Patients Undergoing Primary Varicose Vein Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction . Varicose vein surgery common . Worldwide , common indication type surgery cosmesis . However , also medical indication , include venous eczema , lipodermatosclerosis venous ulceration . The surgery usually straight forward instance do day case . Patient medical practitioner expectation therefore high . Surgery groin notorious risk wound infection . In primary varicose vein surgery , groin wound infection rate high 20 % 1 . A realistic figure might approximately 10 % ( Sains PS , Reddy KM , Jones HJS Derodra JK . Audit varicose vein surgery : patient perspective . Phlebology 2005 20 ( 4 ) 179 - 182 . ) A small prospective study conduct Royal Hobart Hospital establish wound infection rate hospital . All procedure perform care single surgeon routinely soaks groin wound Betadine . Patients follow weekly basis six week wound inspection independent nurse consultant . Of 11 patient ( five female , mean age 50.3years , range 31 - 74 year , mean weight 92kg , range 60 - 130kg , mean body mass index 41 ) complete six week follow , total 17 groin wound . Only one ( 6 % ) infection . Unfortunately , study terminate prematurely independent nurse perform wound assessment replace lag interval least 6 week replacement due start . One major problem varicose vein surgery risk recurrence . Recurrent varicose vein difficult deal primary varicose vein thus every effort must make time primary surgery perform operation low recurrence rate . Despite adequate surgery , recurrence develop via neovascularisation groin . This may part normal wound heal process . If neovascularisation prevent , may reduce recurrence rate . However , detriment heal groin wound . Previous vitro study look effect povidone-iodine component wound heal . It toxic granulocyte , monocyte keratinocytes 2 , 3 . Dilute Povidone-Iodine solution also know inhibit human skin fibroblast growth vitro 4 , 5 . In vivo study , however , fail show clinically significant delay wound heal wound irrigated povidine iodine 4 . Povidine-iodine bacteriocidal effect 6 . Could groin wound develop infection develop neovascularisation part inflammatory response ? Topical antimicrobial agent commonly use wound management . This base premise reduction bacterial contamination aid wound heal . Sindelar show incidence superficial infection surgical wound irrigate povidone-iodine solution prior closure less wound irrigated saline ( 2.9 % vs. 15.1 % ) 7 . No toxicity report povidone-iodine used brief rinse soak , plan study . In order ass effect Betadine ( 10 % povidone-iodine ) groin wound infection rate recurrence rate patient undergoing primary varicose vein surgery conduct prospective , randomize study . Following injury haemostasis , hypoxia , high lactate level acidosis stimulate angiogenesis . Under influence factor bFGF VEGF , endothelial cell proliferate form capillary bud . These cell secrete matrix metalloproteases allow vascular bud dissect wound matrix EGF PDGF recruit pericytes stabilise new vessel formation ( Betsholtz C , Lindblom P , Gerhardt H. Role pericytes vascular morphogenesis . EXS9422005 ; 115 - 125 Investigators . Mr. S. R. Walker - Staff Specialist , Vascular Surgery . Prof. Sinha - Associate Professor Surgery Mr. David Cottier - Visiting Medical Officer - Vascular Surgery . Protocol . Inclusion criterion - Patients undergoing primary saphenofemoral ligation varicose vein ( combine short saphenous surgery ) . Exclusion criterion - Allergy iodine Redo groin dissection Patients multiple avulsion saphenopopliteal ligation Patients unable return outpatient 6 week undergo assessment wound care nurse Patients admit care Prof. Sinha Mr. S. R. Walker include . Patients suitable study recruit outpatient department . If patient agrees include study , undergo pre-operative venous duplex scan . This may alter operative plan . If patient duplex scan prior decision surgery , scan need repeat . On admission surgery patient undergo usual pre-operative work , include weight height . Their past medical history record . All patient receive pre-operative dose low molecular weight heparin ( Clexane 20mg ) thromboembolic prophylaxis . The groin area shave immediately operation . The groin leg prepare surgery usual way use aqueous Betadine . No prophylactic antibiotic give . The surgical procedure groin perform standard manner expose saphenofemoral junction . The junction tributary ligate . In case long saphenous vein pin strip level knee . At point , patient randomize via seal envelope either saline soak gauze Betadine soak gauze place groin wound . This leave place minimum one minute . Some surgeon may choose close groin wound proceed avulsion others may choose leave soak swab place avulsion dealt . The length time swab leave groin wound record . The groin wound close vicral fascia monocryl skin . The groin wound dress non occlusive dressing . Post operative protocol - Patients book see wound care consultant weekly basis 6 week . The patient book Prof. Sinha Mr. Walker 's outpatient clinic Thursday morning . The wound care consultant attend clinic assess wound . The wound care consultant blind whether saline Betadine use groin . The wound classify : 1 . - normal post operative wound , sign infection 2 . - erythema wound extend 5mm wound edge 3 . - erythema 5mm wound discharge 4 . - discharge pu wind 5 . - wound dehiscence infection , presence pu necrotic tissue . At six week follow , patient undergo venous duplex scan . This scan performed ensure adequate surgical procedure perform . One year follow surgical procedure , patient undergo final venous duplex scan ass sign recurrence , particular , recurrence groin . Both post operative duplex request form complete time original operation date request form scan . End point . Primary end point - groin wound infection Secondary end point - groin recurrence varicose vein Statistics . If use Betadine reduce infection rate ( 20 % ) recurrence rate 50 % , study 90 % power , would require least 100 patient group . This number could readily recruit multicentre study .
