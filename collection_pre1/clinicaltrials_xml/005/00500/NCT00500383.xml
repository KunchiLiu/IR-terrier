	<brief_summary>This study aim evaluate light base technique , call Optical Breast Spectroscopy ( OBS ) formerly know Transillumination Breast Spectroscopy ( TiBS ) , use detect difference breast tissue high- low-risk population within high-risk population BrCa1 2 carrier non-carriers . These difference may include difference breast tissue composition metabolism time enrollment study ( possibly reflect change occur adolescence ) rate breast tissue change time ( possibly reflect rate tissue transformation normal ultimately malignant state ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Using Optical Breast Spectroscopy ( OBS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preliminary data show Optical Breast Spectroscopy ( OBS ) ability detect tissue difference various pathology age-related change breast tissue two year period . In present study , want determine whether OBS ability detect optical difference woman harbor mutation breast cancer susceptibility gene , BrCa1 BrCa2 , age-matched control ( non-carriers ) . More specifically , possible difference breast tissue time enrollment study ( reflect change potentially occur adolescence ) rate breast tissue change time ( reflect rate tissue transformation normal ultimately malignant state ) . The overall goal develop pre-screening technique survey monitor risk breast tissue advise early point image technique ( e.g . MRI ) initiate drastic primary prevention measure recommend .</detailed_description>
