	<brief_summary>This study examine role certain area brain blepharospasm , type dystonia ( abnormality movement muscle tone ) cause unwanted uncontrollable blink closing eyelid . The study compare brain activity healthy volunteer people blepharospasm find difference brain may lead good treatment dystonia . Healthy volunteer people blepharospasm 18 year age old may eligible study . All candidate screen medical history . People blepharospasm also physical examination blepharospasm rating . Participants undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) electromyography ( EMG ) two 4-hour session , separate 1 7 day . TMS A wire coil hold subject 's scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . The subject hears click may feel pull sensation skin coil . There may twitch muscle face , arm leg . During stimulation , subject may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action . Repetitive TMS involve repeat magnetic pulse deliver short burst impulse . Subjects receive 60 pulse per minute 15 minute . EMG Surface EMG do TMS measure electrical activity muscle . For test , electrode ( small metal disk ) fill conductive gel tap skin face ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives This proposal evaluate role increase excitability orbicularis oculus ( OO ) muscle representation medial frontal area ( supplementary motor area , SMA ) anterior rostral cingulate : M3 ) excessive blink patient benign essential blepharospasm ( BEB ) . We hypothesize : 1. rest , decrease MEP 15 minute 1Hz rTMS , target SMA-M3 , prominent patient BEP healthy control subject , 2. rest , decrease MEP 15 minute 1Hz rTMS target M1 , almost patient BEP healthy control subject , 3. rest , sICI OO muscle decrease ICF increase stimulation SMA-M3 facial cortical area , patient BEP compare healthy control subject , 4. rest sICI ICF OO muscle stimulation M1 facial area patient BEP healthy control subject , 5. healthy control subject facilitation MEPs evoke M1 prominent voluntary blinking , 6. healthy control subject facilitation MEP evoke SMA-M3 prominent involuntary blinking , 7. patient BEB facilitation MEPs evoke M1 SMA-M3 voluntary involuntary blinking . 8. possible evoke consistent reproducible motor evoke response ( MEP ) orbicularis oculi ( OO ) muscle stimulate two main cortical representation upper facial region : medial frontal wall ( SMA cingulate cortex - rostral part , M3 ) primary motor cortex ( M1 ) transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . Study population 36 patient BEB without severe forceful closure eyelid , 36 normal volunteer . Study design Subjects 3 visit : Visit 1 : screening blepharospasm score Visit 2 : stimulation OO muscle representation SMA-M3 use low frequency rTMS ( 1Hz ) Hesed coil ( design stimulate deep brain ) . Visit 3 : stimulation OO muscle representation M1 use low frequency rTMS ( 1Hz ) use standard eight-shaped coil . Visits 2 3 : single pulse TMS use evoke MEPs OO muscle . Paired pulse TMS use assess sICI OO muscle . The order visit 2 3 randomly assign . Outcome measure The main outcome measure size OO muscle MEPs amount sICI assess 15 minute low frequency rTMS . The secondary outcome measure size OO muscle MEPs assess voluntary involuntary blink .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy volunteer ( age 18 old ) willing participate . Patients ( age 18 old ) benign essential blepharospasm EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS : Subjects history neurological psychiatric disorder , current use history alcohol drug abuse , psychiatric disorder require hospitalization prolong treatment , head injury loss consciousness , epilepsy . Subjects receive drug act primarily central nervous system EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS : Subjects history neurological disorder blepharospasm Subjects history psychiatric disorder , current use history alcohol drug abuse , psychiatric disorder require hospitalization prolong treatment , head injury loss consciousness , epilepsy . Subjects receive drug act primarily central nervous system Subjects treat botulinum toxin injection within 3 month prior participation study Subjects take medication dystonia time study Subjects severe forceful closure eyelid , subject score 20 Blepharospasm Disability scale ( Lindeboom et al. , 1995 ) . Patients participation study would , opinion investigator , cause undue stress excessive apprehensiveness also exclude . The reason , patient , stressful situation ( like medical exam experiment ) may cause strong increase involuntary blink rate lead severe functional discomfort . The following exclusion criterion due use transcranial magnetic stimulation repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 1Hz ( Hallett 1999 ) healthy volunteer patient : Subjects cardiac pacemaker , intracardiac line , implant medication pump . Subjects eye , blood vessel , cochlear , eye implant . Subjects increase intracranial pressure evaluate clinical mean Subjects metal cranium Subjects dental brace ( dental filling problem ) , metal fragment occupational exposure surgical clip near brain . Subjects personal family history hearing loss</criteria>
