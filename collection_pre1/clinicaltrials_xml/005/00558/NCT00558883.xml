	<detailed_description>Acarbose , alpha-glucosidase-inhibitor , delay release glucose complex carbohydrates upper small intestine . The digestion carbohydrates acarbose intake therefore mainly take place lower small intestine colon . Through innovative mode action postprandial hyperglycemia specifically delay flatten . Acarbose use 15 year therapy type 2 diabetes . Efficiency safety treat diabetes prove extensive study . Until today serious side effect acarbose report , reduction HbA1c 0.7-1 % . Three large prospective study metaanalysis resp. , could prove acarbose highly significant positive effect incidence progression cardiovascular disease people prediabetes type 2 diabetes resp . In STOP-NIDDM-trail person prediabetes well meta-analysis type 2 diabetes ( MERIA ) event rate acarbose group ~ 50 % low . In substudy STOP-NIDDM intervention study ca . 50 % low progression intima-media-thickness A. carotis communis document acarbose comparison placebo . In multivariate analysis acarbose always important independent determinant vasoprotective effect . Epidemiological investigation , even control prospective study , establish causal relationship . Thus question rise wether acarbose - besides know therapeutic effect postprandial hyperglycemia pleiotropic effect , lead document preventive effect cardiovascular complication . This would principal importance use acarbose patient prediabetes / type 2 diabetes increase vascular risk . So far acarbose cardiovascular oral antidiabetic drug people IGT . Working hypothesis : Acarbose change complex way transport , digestion place glucose release absorption . As result intestinal milieu , intestinal flora provision enzymes low small intestine change . This modify immune response intestinal wall food proinflammatory effect . The small intestine big immune organ organism . The postprandial glucose increase could direct effect low-grade inflammation . Toxic effect ( glucotoxicity ) , activation immune system low-grade inflammation could reason develop endothelial dysfunction affect plaque stability . The activity lymphocyte immune system intestine would component , acarbose could take influence diabetogenesis atherogenesis . The question enterovasal axis one fascinate new research concepts basis incretin-related drug treatment diabetes resp . As intravasal indicator low-grade inflammation consider : leucocyte , high sensitive C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) plasminogen activator inhibitor active antigen ( PAI1 ) well lymphocytes subpopulation . The effect acarbose parameter postprandial phase know yet .</detailed_description>
