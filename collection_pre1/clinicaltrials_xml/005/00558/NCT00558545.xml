	<brief_title>A Phase 1-2 , XIAP Antisense AEG35156 With Weekly Paclitaxel Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common cancer woman United States , second common cause cancer death , main cause death woman age 45 55 . In 2006 , 212,920 American woman diagnose breast cancer , 40,970 die disease. [ 1 ] . Fewer 10 percent woman present metastatic disease time diagnosis . However , majority woman relapse initial definitive therapy early stage locally advanced disease disseminate metastatic disease rather isolate local recurrence . Treatment metastatic disease palliative intent usually involve hormone therapy and/or chemotherapy without trastuzumab . Active chemotherapy agent include anthracyclines , taxanes , vinorelbine , alkylating agent antimetabolite . Taxanes become cornerstone first-line treatment metastatic breast cancer . Weekly dos paclitaxel administer continuously several week remarkable lack myelosuppression [ 2 ] . Weekly paclitaxel ( 80 mg/m2 ) directly compare every three-week therapy ( 175 mg/m2 ) 585 woman metastatic breast cancer . Weekly therapy associate significantly high response rate ( 40 versus 28 percent ) long TTP ( nine versus five month ) , similar overall survival bad neurotoxicity [ 3 ] . Since patient metastatic breast cancer unlikely cure disease [ 4 ] , consider candidate clinical trial .</detailed_description>
