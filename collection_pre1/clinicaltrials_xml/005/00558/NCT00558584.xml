	<brief_title>Multicenter Study Immunoadsorption Dilated Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) characterize ventricular chamber enlargement systolic dysfunction normal LV wall thickness . According report heretofore , incidence disorder industrialize Western country lie within order magnitude 5 - 8 new illness per year every 100,000 population . The prevalence , accordingly , approximately 36 patient every 100,000 population . However , recent data suggest high actual prevalence DCM : present estimate prevalence congestive heart failure range 2 % 6 % . According recently publish study ( e.g. , MERIT-HF study COPERNICUS study ) , 30 % 35 % patient congestive heart failure suffer non-ischemic myocardial heart disease . DCM diagnose , furthermore , 12 % patient CIBIS II study . Approximately 26 % patient reduce left-ventricular systolic function CHARM-added study suffer heart failure due DCM . Based data , assumption justify Germany approximately 500,000 patient suffer DCM . Despite advance medical treatment heart failure , general prognosis DCM poor . In many case , treatment option surgical e.g. , heart transplantation implantation assist device . An association virus myocarditis DCM hypothesize subset patient DCM . Both experimental clinical data indicate viral infection inflammatory process involve pathogenesis myocarditis DCM , may represent important factor cause progression ventricular dysfunction . Abnormalities cellular immune system present patient myocarditis DCM . For patient DCM , immunohistological method introduce diagnosis myocardial inflammation . Infiltration lymphocytes mononuclear cell well increased expression cell adhesion molecule , frequent phenomenon DCM . These finding support hypothesis immune process still active . Furthermore , activation humoral immune system production cardiac antibody play important role DCM . Several antibody cardiac structure detect DCM patient - include antibody act mitochondrial protein , alpha- beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain isoforms , cardiac beta-receptor , muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-2 , sarcolemmal Na-K-ATPase . The functional significance cardiac autoantibody debate . It possible autoantibody form consequence inflammatory reaction cellular destruction , case regard epiphenomenon . Cardiac autoantibody , hand , may likewise play active role pathogenesis DCM trigger disease process , contribute development myocardial contractile dysfunction . For certain antibody , in-vitro data indicate negative effect cardiac performance . In myocarditis DCM , heart-reactive cytotoxic auto-antibodies ADP/ATP carrier find . These antibody cross-react calcium channel cardiomyocytes . Purified antibody obtain DCM patient induce negative inotropic effect isolate rat cardiomyocytes decrease calcium transient . Immunization rodent peptides derived cardiovascular G-protein receptor induce morphological change myocardial tissue resemble DCM . Furthermore , recent data provide evidence antibody beat1-receptor induce DCM : rat immunize second extracellular loop cardiac beta1-receptors develop progressive leave ventricular dilatation dysfunction . Interestingly , serum transfer immunized animal unsensitized rat induce similar cardiomyopathic phenotype , thus demonstrate pathogenic potential particular antibody development DCM . Further confirmation principle autoantibody contribute induction disease process progression DCM provide recent study . The author show mice deficient program cell death-1 ( PD-1 ) immunoinhibitory co-receptor develop autoimmune DCM production high-titre circulate IgG autoantibody reactive 33-kilodalton protein express specifically surface cardiomyocytes . This antigen recently identify cardiac troponin I . When cardiac antibody impair cardiac function , removal would logically expect lead improvement patient 's haemodynamic situation . Cardiac antibodies belong IgG fraction eliminate immunoadsorption ( IA ) therapy . Immunoadsorption introduce method treatment autoimmune process e.g. , Goodpasture 's syndrome lupus erythematodes . This form therapy already successfully apply treatment DCM . Several pilot study show IA improve cardiac function patient DCM . The first uncontrolled pilot study disclose acute beneficial haemodynamic effect IA patient severe heart failure due DCM . A randomize study follow , investigate haemodynamic effect additional IA therapy DCM . This study include patient DCM ( NYHA III-IV , LVEF &lt; 30 % ) stable medication . In IA group , IA conduct three consecutive day , one IA session daily . On ground safety - i.e. , reduce risk infection immunoglobulin depletion - immunoglobulin G substitute last IA session . Immunoadsorption subsequent IgG substitution ( IA/IgG ) repeat 3 course monthly interval month 3 . In contrast control group , patient IA/IgG group demonstrate 3 month significant increase cardiac index ( CI ) , parallel similar increase stroke volume index . A recent study demonstrate IA/IgG therapy likewise mitigate inflammatory process myocardium DCM patient . A case-controlled study , perform others , conduct IA one course 5 consecutive day without IgG substitution subsequent immunoglobulin depletion . This study repeat IA follow-up . In study , LVEF increase 22 40 % one year IA : significant gain contrast control group without IA therapy . Recent data indicate beneficial haemodynamic effect IA relate removal negative inotropic cardiac antibody . Detection cardio-depressant antibody plasma DCM patient , IA , effectively predict acute prolonged haemodynamic improvement IA . A study clearly disclose cardio depressant antibody belong IG-3 subclass [ 38 ] . The removal antibody IgG-3 subclass accordingly represent essential mechanism IA therapy DCM . Protein-A anti-IgG column license IA . Anti-IgG sepharose effectively eliminate IgG subclass , include IgG-3 . Protein A bind Fc part human IgG-1 , -2 , -4 . However , affinity protein A IgG-3 low . IgG-3 removal markedly increase protein-A , use optimized treatment regime , prolong IA course 4 - 5 session , reduce loading volume protein column plasma . In use adsorption regime IgG-3 elimination , protein-A IA induces significant acute prolonged haemodynamic improvement DCM patient . Furthermore , IA treatment protein A adsorption perform 1 course 5 consecutive day induces improvement leave ventricular function DCM patient period 6 month , result comparable received IA treatment repeat 4 course monthly interval . Despite optimized medical treatment , prognosis DCM still poor . For patient , heart transplantation represent palliative treatment option . Alternative therapeutic strategy treatment DCM consequently essential interest . This randomized multicentre study investigate first time mean double-blind study design whether specific causal intervention - i.e. , removal autoantibody - influence disease process improve cardiac function patient suffer heart failure due DCM .</detailed_description>
