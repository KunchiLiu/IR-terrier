	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy , CC-4047 , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Dexamethasone CC-4047 may stop growth cancer cell block blood flow cancer . Giving CC-4047 together dexamethasone may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give CC-4047 together dexamethasone work treat patient relapsed refractory multiple myeloma amyloidosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CC-4047 Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To assess response rate duration remission low-dose CC-4047 plus dexamethasone patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma amyloidosis . - To assess toxicity CC-4047 plus dexamethasone patient population . - To assess expansion cohort response rate increase CC-4047 dose among patient fail respond adequately initial start dose follow first 2 course treatment . - To assess response rate duration remission CC-4047 plus dexamethasone patient lenalidomide resistant refractory multiple myeloma . - To assess response rate duration remission CC-4047 plus dexamethasone patient previously treat light chain amyloidosis . - To assess response rate duration remission low- high-dose CC-4047 plus dexamethasone patient lenalidomide bortezomib refractory multiple myeloma . - To assess response rate duration remission high-dose CC-4047 plus dexamethasone patient relapse refractory myeloma receive ≤ 3 treatment regimen . OUTLINE : Patients group accord disease status ( relapsed/refractory myeloma [ close accrual 8/5/2008 ] v lenalidomide resistant/refractory myeloma [ close accrual 4/2/2009 ] v previously treat light chain amyloidosis v lenalidomide bortezomib resistant/refractory myeloma { low-dose/day } [ close accrual 11/20/09 ] v lenalidomide bortezomib resistant/refractory myeloma ( high-dose/day ) v relapsed/refractory myeloma { high-dose/day } ) . Patients receive oral CC-4047 day 1-28 oral dexamethasone day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week 6 month .</detailed_description>
