As example , low level tissue omega-3 fatty acid associate markedly high rate death cardiac cause compare patient relatively high concentration omega-3 fatty acid . Obese patient often unhealthy dietary intake evidence increase inflammatory process . After gastric bypass patient decreased absorption fat gastrointestinal tract may become fatty acid deficient . While gastric bypass may decrease death cardiovascular disease morbidly obese patient , cardiovascular disease still common cause death gastric bypass . There numerous nutritional deficiency occur gastric bypass many well document . However , data concern plasma tissue level omega-3 fatty acid morbidly obese patient either operation .</detailed_description>
