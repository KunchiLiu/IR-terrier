	<brief_title>A Randomized Phase 2 Study ARQ 197 Versus Gemcitabine Treatment-Naïve Patients With Unresectable Locally Advanced Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , open-label randomized phase 2 study design evaluate PFS treatment-naïve patient unresectable ( locally advance metastatic ) pancreatic adenocarcinoma follow treatment either ARQ 197 ( ARQ arm ) gemcitabine alone ( GEM arm ) . The study also evaluate efficacy safety parameter include ORR , OS adverse event two treatment arm . Patients randomly assign GEM arm receive gemcitabine alone . Patients assign ARQ arm receive oral ARQ 197 alone . ARQ 197 investigational oral drug supply capsule multiple strength . For study initial shipment capsule 120 mg , 30 count . In ARQ arm , patient take 120 mg ARQ 197 twice daily , morning even one hour prior two hour meal . ARQ 197 treatment continue unacceptable toxicity , document progression disease , another discontinuation criterion meet . Gemcitabine commercially available drug treatment patient locally advance metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas . In GEM arm , gemcitabine administer intravenous infusion 30 minute dose 1000 mg/m2 . The dosing schedule gemcitabine weekly first cycle ( 4 week ) , weekly 3 consecutive week follow week rest subsequent cycle . Gemcitabine therapy continue unacceptable toxicity , document progression disease , another discontinuation criterion meet . A treatment cycle define 28 day treatment arm . Cycles may repeat every 4 week ( 28 day ) base toxicity response . The assigned treatment continue unacceptable toxicity , disease progression ( clinical radiological ) another discontinuation criterion meet . Tumor evaluation : Tumor evaluation perform 8-week interval . Tumor response ( complete response , partial response , stable disease , progressive disease ORR ) evaluate use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . Progression-free survival : The time disease progression-free calculated randomization disease progression per RECIST death due cause . Patients alive progression free censor date last tumor evaluation . Overall survival : Overall survival time calculated date randomization death due cause . Safety assessment : Data vital sign , physical examination , adverse event , serum chemistry , hematological laboratory test , electrocardiograms collect . This study design establish potential efficacy ARQ 197 treatment naive pancreatic cancer patient control , randomize study . The sample size 30 Evaluable patient per treatment group consider adequate provide meaningful estimate PFS ORR OS rate , however , study power show statistically significant difference treatment group . Therefore , analyse primarily descriptive nature . Taking account anticipate drop-out/loss-to-follow-up rate 20 % , total sample size 72 patient . Primary secondary objective analyze two treatment arm use appropriate patient population statistical method .</detailed_description>
