	<brief_summary>Objectives : Primary Objective : To determine whether addition low dose methadone morphine ( methadone group ) low dose escalation index compare morphine alone ( morphine group ) Day 15 ( +/- 3 day ) Secondary Objectives : To determine whether individual methadone arm low pain intensity morphine alone arm demonstrate decrease two point baseline ( +/- 3 day ) ESAS score Day 15 ( +/- 3 day ) . To determine whether methadone group experience few opioid induce neurotoxic side effect ( include sedation , myoclonus , hallucination , hyperalgesia confusion ) compare morphine alone group Day 15 ( +/- 3 day ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Methadone morphine design block pain receptor ( cell sensitive particular drug ) nerve brain . Study Groups Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) 1 2 group . Participants Group 1 stay morphine . Participants Group 2 receive morphine plus methadone . You equal chance ( 50/50 ) place either 2 group . You , medical staff , study researcher know group assign . If necessary , doctor able find group event emergency . Participants Group 1 take 2 dos `` slow-release '' morphine mouth every 12 hour , every day 15 day ( plus minus 3 day ) . You also access `` immediate-release '' morphine use , need , pain . If need 3 immediate-release dos 24-hour period , call study doctor . Participants Group 2 take 1 dose slow-release morphine 1 dose methadone mouth every 12 hour , every day 15 day ( plus minus 3 day ) . You also access immediate-release morphine use , need , pain . If need 3 immediate-release dos 24-hour period , call study doctor . You complete questionnaire daily symptom pain may experience . It take 5 minute complete time . You provide drug diary write often take pain medication . Study Visits : On Days 8 15 ( plus minus 3 day ) follow test procedure perform : - You complete 3 questionnaire side effect may . They take 15-20 minute complete . - You test see sensitive skin . On Day 15 ( plus minus 3 day ) , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure kidney function . Length Study : You off-study Day 15 ( plus minus 3 day ) . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . Methadone morphine FDA approve commercially available . Their use together investigational . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Individual reporting average pain score last 24 hour least 4 numerical scale 0 10 ( 0= pain , 10=the bad possible pain ) history cancer ( active evidence disease ) . 2 . Individual receiving strong opioids ( morphine , fentanyl , oxycodone , hydromorphone ) 3 week prior enrollment . 3 . Individual require least 150 mg daily morphine equivalent daily dose cancer pain . Using formula MEDD = dose X MEDD Factor ( App L ) would follow : morphine : 24 hour total oral intake ( sum PRN around clock dos ) 150 mg great would qualify patient , fentanyl alone : 24 hour total transdermal intake 75mcg/h great would qualify patient , oxycodone alone : 24 hour total oral intake 100 mg great would qualify patient , hydromorphone alone : 24 hour total oral intake 30 mg/day great would qualify patient . 4 . Individual ability receive morphine methadone orally . 5 . Individual known allergy history severe toxicity morphine methadone . 6 . Individual normal cognition define normal state arousal absence obvious clinical finding confusion , memory concentration deficit . 7 . Individual adequate renal function ( creatinine less equal 2.0 MG/DL ) 8 . Individual Zubrod performance status 3 low . 9 . Individual willing sign write informed consent . 10 . Individual 18 year age old . 11 . Individual stable dos ( dose least one week ) nonopioid analgesic include NSAIDS , corticosteroid , gabapentin , pregabalin , antidepressant prescribe purpose pain control . 1 . Individual determine incapable complete evaluation form . 2 . Individual clinically evident impaired cognition . 3 . Patient MEDD great 600 .</criteria>
