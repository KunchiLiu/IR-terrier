	<brief_summary>The Department Anesthesiology conduct clinical trial evaluate pregabalin give prior several day Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) reduce prevalence Complex Regional Pain Syndrome ( CRPS ) late postoperative time . The prevalence complex regional pain syndrome ( CRPS ) follow total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) 13 % 6 month post-surgery . CRPS painful debilitate condition , 4 main class symptom : sensory , include burning , allodynia , hyperalgesia affect limb ; vasomotor , include temperature asymmetry skin color change ; edema sudomotor , include sweating ; movement disorder dystrophy , include decreased range motion , motor dysfunction ( weakness , tremor , dystonia ) change hair , nails skin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Department Anesthesiology conduct clinical trial evaluate pregabalin give prior several day Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) reduce prevalence Complex Regional Pain Syndrome ( CRPS ) late postoperative time . The prevalence complex regional pain syndrome ( CRPS ) follow total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) 13 % 6 month post-surgery . CRPS painful debilitate condition , 4 main class symptom : sensory , include burning , allodynia , hyperalgesia affect limb ; vasomotor , include temperature asymmetry skin color change ; edema sudomotor , include sweating ; movement disorder dystrophy , include decreased range motion , motor dysfunction ( weakness , tremor , dystonia ) change hair , nails skin . Gabapentin related potent compound pregabalin show reduce postoperative pain animal model . Pregabalin also reduce neuropathic pain rat . In patient , gabapentin administer surgery treat postoperative pain . In addition , pregabalin give postoperatively reduce dental pain molar extraction . Gabapentin use many year patient neuropathic pain , include reflex sympathetic dystrophy . More recently , pregabalin also show efficacious treatment neuropathic pain . However , clinical study investigate whether perioperative administration gabapentin pregabalin reduce persistent long-term pain syndrome e.g . CRPS.Subjects age 21 80 recruit obtain Informed Consent .</detailed_description>
