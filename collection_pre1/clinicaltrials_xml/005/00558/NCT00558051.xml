	<brief_title>Alpha-type-1 Dendritic Cell-based Vaccines Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dendritic cell ( DC ) -based vaccination , usually administer traditional intradermal route , new treatment option cancer patient . While previous DC-based vaccination trial show safety approach ability induce objective clinical response , overall efficacy DC-based vaccine still disappoint ( Rosenberg et al. , 2004 ) . We hypothesize two likely cause limited clinical activity : A ) suboptimal type DCs use vaccine B ) suboptimal mode use vaccine allow vaccinate patient fully benefit DC biology . We conduct pilot evaluation therapeutic vaccination DC1s load autologous tumor material , patient metastatic colorectal cancer resect minimal evidence disease.The propose evaluation novel intralymphatic route DC-based vaccination allow u administer vaccine way physiologic respect kinetics antigen appearance lymph node feasible perform repetitive fashion , without damage local lymph node .</detailed_description>
