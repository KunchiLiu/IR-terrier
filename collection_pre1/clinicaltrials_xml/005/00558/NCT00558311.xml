	<brief_summary>The aim study demonstrate clazosentan , administer continuous intravenous infusion 5 mg/h Day 14 post aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( aSAH ) , reduce incidence cerebral vasospasm -related morbidity all-cause mortality within 6 week post-aSAH treat surgical clipping . The primary endpoint study occurrence cerebral vasospasm-related morbidity , mortality all-causes within 6 week post-aSAH , define least one following : 1 . Death ( cause ) . 2 . New cerebral infarct ( ) due cerebral vasospasm either primary relevant contributing cause , adjudicate entirely due cause vasospasm . 3 . Delayed ischemic neurological deficit ( DIND ) due cerebral vasospasm either primary relevant contributing cause , adjudicate entirely due cause vasospasm . 4 . Neurological sign symptom ( depend state consciousness ) , presence confirm cerebral vasospasm angiography ( DSA CTA ) , lead administration valid rescue therapy . An independent Critical Events Committee ( CEC ) adjudicate whether patient meet primary endpoint individual morbidity component .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Males female age 18 75 year ( inclusive ) . 2 . Patients rupture saccular aneurysm , confirm angiography ( digital subtraction angiography [ DSA ] compute tomography angiography [ CTA ] ) , successfully secure surgical clipping . The time aneurysm rupture must know possible estimate reasonable degree certainty . 3 . World Federation Neurological Surgeons ( WFNS ) grade IIV measure prior clip procedure , worsen grade V postprocedure ( base regular Glasgow Coma Scale [ GCS ] ) * 4 . Patients diffuse clot ( long axis &gt; = 20 mm , clot present across hemisphere ) baseline CT scan . 5 . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test must use reliable method contraception 12 week follow study drug discontinuation . 6 . Written inform consent participate study must obtain patient legal representative prior initiation studymandated procedure randomization . Patients must evaluable WFNS grade prior clipping procedure . Patients assess WFNS postprocedure due requirement uninterrupted sedation ( e.g. , high unstable intracranial pressure [ ICP ] ) may include study provide CT scan perform 12 hour postprocedure , prior randomization , rule large procedurerelated infarct . 1 . Patients subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) due cause saccular aneurysm ( e.g. , trauma rupture fusiform mycotic aneurysm ) . 2 . Patients intraventricular intracerebral blood , absence subarachnoid blood , local clot . 3 . Presence cerebral vasospasm see angiography prior clipping procedure . 4 . Patients experience major complication clip procedure , massive bleeding , major arterial occlusion , large territorial cerebral infarct define involve &gt; 1/3 vascular territory , new major neurological deficit postprocedure ( e.g. , hemiplegia aphasia last &gt; = 12 hour postaneurysm clip ) . * 5 . Patients study drug start within 56 hour aneurysm rupture . 6 . Patients aneurysm secure coil . 7 . Patients know , time screening , certain followup , protocolmandated imaging assessment feasible . 8 . Patients hypotension ( systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &lt; = 90 mmHg ) refractory treatment . 9 . Patients aspiration pneumonia . 10 . Patients pulmonary edema severe cardiac failure require inotropic support . 11 . Any severe unstable concomitant condition disease ( e.g. , know significant neurological deficit , cancer , hematological , coronary disease ) , chronic condition ( e.g. , psychiatric disorder ) , , opinion investigator , would affect assessment safety efficacy study drug . 12 . Significant kidney and/or liver disease , define plasma creatinine &gt; = 2.5 mg/dL ( 221 micromol/l ) and/or total bilirubin &gt; 3 mg/dL ( 51.3 micromol/l ) measure local site laboratory . 13 . Patients receive i.v . nimodipine , i.v . nicardipine , fasudil hydrochloride , must drug discontinue least 4 hour prior initiation study treatment . 14 . Patients receive statin less 2 week prior admission must discontinue prior study drug initiation . 15 . Patients receive cyclosporin A calcineurin inhibitor ( e.g. , tacrolimus ) , patient know time randomization medication start study drug infusion period . 16 . Patients receive investigational product within 28 day prior randomization already participate current study . 17 . Patients unlikely comply protocol ( e.g. , unable return followup visit ) . 18 . Known hypersensitivity endothelin receptor antagonist . 19 . Patients current alcohol drug abuse dependence . Further detail exclusion criterion number 4 : `` Large territorial infarct '' refers infarct detect clip procedure immediately postprocedure ( i.e. , CT perform suspicion cerebral infarct complication ) . This imply wait 2448 hour postprocedure perform protocolmandated CT scan order randomize patient . Evaluation new major neurological deficit postprocedure imply reversal sedation ( wait patient recover sedation ) performance GCS examination ( verbal score intubate patient may extrapolate eyeopening motor score use value provide table include Section 3.9.1.2.1 protocol ) . In event new major neurological deficit improve within 12 hour clip procedure , patient include study .</criteria>
