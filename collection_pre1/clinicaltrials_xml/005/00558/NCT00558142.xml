	<brief_summary>Millions people receive radiographic contrast material investigation like CT coronary angiography . While consider safe healthy patient , cause acute renal impairment . This term radiocontrast-induced nephropathy ( RCIN ) generally define increase serum creatinine baseline 25 % 0.5 mg/dL ( 44.2 μmol/l ) within 48 hr . RCIN occur less 2 % patient normal renal function common patient pre-existing renal damage . The pathophysiology RCIN unclear . Possible mechanisms involve 1 ) reduce renal blood flow lead acute tubular necrosis 2 ) direct renal tubular injury oxygen free radical . Current prevention strategy focus increase renal blood flow reduce oxidative stress . Patients risk RCIN currently receive fluid , low dose contrast , variable unproven dos acetylcysteine . The evidence acetylcysteine administration unclear . A RCIN consensus work group report American Journal Cardiology September 2006 `` N-acetylcysteine consistently effective reduce risk contrast-induced nephropathy '' . The perception benefit acetylcysteine administration unproven disadvantage clinician report give large amount radio-contrast patient receive acetylcysteine since believe prevents RCIN . There need determine acetylcysteine might prevent RCIN identify appropriate dose route administration . Since acetylcysteine vasodilator well antioxidant , may work two distinct way , prevent reduction renal blood flow ( RBF ) contrast-induced oxidative damage . Previous study use change serum creatinine . In addition insensitive marker alter renal function , contrast cause renal vasoconstriction acetylcysteine vasodilatation , change serum creatinine ideal marker effect . Finally optimum dose route acetylcysteine administration unclear , illustrated study use variety dos route . We propose study mechanism effect acetylcysteine healthy diseased kidney , unstressed stress radiocontrast administration . We hypothesise acetylcysteine may exert renoprotective effect RCIN renal vasodilatation and/or antioxidant mechanism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms Effect Acetylcysteine Renal Function After Exposure Radiographic Contrast Material</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study test hypothesis acetylcysteine exert renoprotective effect RCIN antioxidant and/or renal vasodilator mechanism . We take structured 4−part approach , use randomise control cross−over study assess effect acetylcysteine renal function normal diseased kidney , effect contrast normal kidney , without acetylcysteine treatment . We also perform parallel−group randomise control trial angiography CKD patient without acetylcysteine treatment . The four group study simultaneously . As per decision MHRA , study phase IV trial authorize medication rather phase I trial . The study perform simultaneously four group participant , study : 1. healthy volunteer receive acetylcysteine PO , acetylcysteine IV , placebo 2. volunteer stage III CKD receive acetylcysteine PO , acetylcysteine IV , placebo 3. healthy volunteer receive radiographic contrast plus acetylcysteine PO , acetylcysteine IV , placebo 4. patient stage III CKD receive radiographic contrast elective coronary angiography plus acetylcysteine PO , acetylcysteine IV , placebo . The study perform Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility Royal Infirmary Edinburgh ( RIE ) . Volunteers pay £120 cover travelling expense study arm . STUDIES 1 AND 2 These study assess effect acetylcysteine alone healthy volunteer volunteer stage III CKD . Volunteers randomise three−way , cross−over , double−blind comparison match placebo oral intravenous regimen acetylcysteine . The primary outcome change RBF ( measure para−aminohippuric acid [ PAH ] clearance ) . In addition , GFR ( measure inulin clearance ) , tubular function ( fractional excretion potassium sodium ) , oxidative balance ( total oxidative capacity , plasma urinary isoprostanes ) , plasma urinary endothelin−1 assay . The pharmacokinetics acetylcysteine measure compare IV PO regimens . Volunteers randomise receive three occasion , separate least two week , one : A ) placebo capsule PO , plus IV infusion acetylcysteine normal saline . B ) acetylcysteine capsule PO , plus infusion normal saline . C ) placebo capsule PO , plus infusion normal saline . DOSE JUSTIFICATION There currently data guide choice optimum oral IV acetylcysteine regimen . This study assess effect IV oral dose acetylcysteine ( IV 200mg/kg ; PO 68.6 mg/kg ) similar currently use clinical practice . The oral dose expect produce plasma concentration much low IV dose ; however , believe first pas effect oral administration may increase conversion liver acetylcysteine cysteine glutathione , increase efficacy oral dose . The first clinical trial RCIN use arbitrary low dose oral regimen acetylcysteine − 600mg twice day ( BD ) 2 day , start day dye administration ( total dose 2.4 g , 34.3 mg/kg 70kg patient ) . Recent study use high total dos 1500mg BD 2 day ( total dose 6 g , 85.7 mg/kg 70kg patient ) . IV regimens also assess since propose effective start day dye administration , rather day . The first trial use dose similar use early treatment paracetamol−induced hepatotoxicity - 150 mg/kg 30 min , 50mg/kg 4 hr ( total dose 200 mg/kg ) - report less nephropathy . Other study use low dos ( eg . 500 mg 15 min [ 7.1 mg/kg 70 kg patient ] 1000 mg twice , procedure , [ 28.5 mg/kg 70kg patient ] ) find benefit . Overall , choice acetylcysteine regimen previous study seem base ease prior practice paracetamol poison rather knowledge acetylcysteine 's effect kidney . We choose revise IV high dose regimen derive PK data publish Dr L Prescott Monte Carlo simulation ( Dr R Thanacoody , Consultant Clinical Pharmacologist , Edinburgh Royal infirmary , unpublished ) 2 reason : 1. RCT show benefit IV acetylcysteine use high dose regimen similar use paracetamol poisoning ( 150 mg/kg 30 min , 50 mg/kg 4 hr ) . The subsequent negative study use much low dos , suggest IV acetylcysteine may need give high dos . 2. high peak plasma concentration result rapid initial infusion acetylcysteine paracetamol poison produce nausea 40 % patient anaphylactoid reaction 20 % . Although reaction routine normally easily treat , important reduce rate reaction study participant . The revised regimen provide similar amount acetylcysteine administers evenly across 7 hour , produce low peak acetylcysteine concentration lower likelihood nausea anaphylactoid reaction ( Dr R Thanacoody , unpublished ) . The choice oral acetylcysteine regimen necessarily arbitrary . We use 1200 mg since evidence effective usually administer 600 mg. STUDY 3 This study assess effect acetylcysteine renal function healthy volunteer receive single IV 100ml dose Visipaque 320 ( iodixanol , equivalent 320 mg iodine/ml ) , iso−osmolar non−ionic radio−contrast agent , via peripheral cannula . We choose dose 100 ml routinely use Royal Infirmary coronary angiography CKD patient ( Radiology Dept , personal communication ) . Larger dose 400 ml use angioplasty subsequently require . Such dos fall within dos recommend summary product characteristic , Martindale , literature . The safety profile dose healthy adult excellent ; patient CKD , iodixanol least safe contrast agent . Volunteers randomise study three−way , cross−over , double−blind comparison placebo oral intravenous regimen acetylcysteine . They receive coronary angiography , intravenous contrast . We study healthy volunteer order identify effect NAC contrast healthy kidney . This provide baseline data interpret study CKD patient . In addition , healthy patient rarely get RCIN contrast administration , currently use marker RCIN ( raise serum creatinine ) crude measure renal dysfunction − since GFR fall renal RBF substantially reduce significant period time . It likely small sub−clinical change occur healthy patient help determine contrast NAC affect kidney . STUDY 4 This study assess effect acetylcysteine renal function stable stage III CKD patient receive 100 ml iodixanol routine coronary angiography . Recruited patient receive multiple angiography study 4 crossover comparison randomise control study oral acetylcysteine vs. IV acetylcysteine vs. placebo . Results study 1−3 inform analysis interpretation study . MEASUREMENTS OF RENAL FUNCTION Most previous RCTs measure change serum creatinine concentration rather direct measure renal failure . Serum creatinine concentration provide information GFR . However , accurate since affected diet , age muscle mass . Furthermore , acetylcysteine also lower serum creatinine concentration , suggest low creatinine note RCTs may actually reflect improved renal function . GFR best marker global renal function . It directly measure use 51Cr−EDTA method complicate technique . We use alternative method measure plasma clearance inulin . Serum cystatin C concentration may better marker GFR creatinine . Cystatin C small cysteine protease secrete fixed rate nucleate cell affect diet muscle mass . In RCIN , serum cystatin concentration peak normalise rapidly creatinine . We measure cystatin C patient ass whether would better marker GFR future RCTs . Changes renal blood flow acetylcysteine and/or contrast administration assess measure plasma PAH clearance . Endothelin−1 ( ET−1 ) potent endogenous vasoconstrictor increase urinary ET−1 associate development RCIN . Changes renal ET−1 production measure follow acetylcysteine and/or contrast measuring ET−1 concentration plasma urine calculate fractional excretion . Renal tubular function assess measure kidney 's fractional excretion sodium potassium . Reductions fractional excretion ion supply information renal perfusion tubular function , note previously RCIN . We also measure urine level protein release damage tubular cell . Since acetylcysteine alter oxidative state , measure oxidative balance assay plasma urinary isoprostanes , plasma N−acetylcysteine , peripheral blood cell glutathione , total antioxidant capacity . ADMINISTRATION OF ORAL ACETYLCYSTEINE/PLACEBO Participants receive 3 blister pack acetylcysteine placebo capsule ask take appropriate capsule 08.00 20.00 day study day ( Day 1 ; Day 2 day spend CRF ) . They also ask drink extra 500ml water ensure adequate hydration . Hard capsule contain acetylcysteine 600 mg match placebo ( Lactose PhEur 600 mg ) prepare Tayside Pharmaceuticals , Dundee , package patient pack 8 capsule . The capsule deliver hospital pharmacy supply participant accord randomize allocation order . INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION OF DRUGS Inulin PAH administer 20G venous cannula insert forearm . Inulin PAH infuse constant infusion rate throughout 8 hour study period . Acetylcysteine/placebo administer second 20G venous cannula insert forearm . We use intravenous acetylcysteine preparation currently use Royal Infirmary Edinburgh ( Parvolex , UCB Pharma Limited ) . Placebo sodium chloride solution infusion . Active placebo infusion prepare Clinical Research Facility study day accord randomize allocation order . VENOUS BLOOD SAMPLING Blood sample obtain via 17G venous cannula insert forearm . Samples take hourly 10 occasion −1h ( begin inulin/PAH infusion ) 8h ; total 120 ml take . Blood also sample 24h ( 09.00 day 3 ) 72h 09.00 day 5 ) ; 24 ml time . URINE SAMPLING 40ml urine sample take void every two hour , 0h 8h day 1 , 24h ( 09.00 day 3 ) 72h ( 09.00 day 5 ) . Participants ask void urine waking day 3 5 . At end study , venous cannulae remove haemostasis confirm . Subjects provide toast warm beverage observe 30 minute leave unit .</detailed_description>
