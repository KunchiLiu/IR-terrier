	<brief_title>Vitamin A Supplementation Modulation Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Immune Responses Latent Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) remain significant global health problem . Approximately third world 's population infect Mycobacterium tuberculosis 95 % case occur develop country . This enormous pool latently infect individual expect pose major obstacle TB control highly endemic country globally . In high income , low TB burden country , target test TB case contact treatment latent TB infection ( LTBI ) practise component TB control strategy . However , practised high burden , low-income country . New evidence mathematical modelling suggest , meet millennium development goal , intervention M. tuberculosis infection require . Children increase risk rapid progression active disease ( usually within year infant ) . , Malnutrition identify major risk factor progression TB profound effect cellular immune function- key host defence TB . There 2 type risk associate malnutrition : acquisition infection risk infection progress disease . Therefore , population high prevalence latent TB infection , co-prevalent malnutrition may influence TB incidence rate . Vitamin A supplementation clearly show reduce all-cause child mortality develop country . Vitamin A give recommended dos profound effect improve outcome measles overall childhood mortality morbidity . The mechanism attribute modulation immune response addition correct underlying deficiency . In TB patient , nearly impossible determine nutritional status disease thus determine whether malnutrition lead TB TB lead malnutrition . However , study establish link vitamin A deficiency susceptibility respiratory infection progression latent active TB disease . Preschool child symptomatic vitamin A deficiency find respiratory disease twice rate non-deficient child , irrespective anthropometric status . Getz et al find 81 % person cohort LTBI low level vitamin A developed disease compare 30 % normal level . We previously observe 32 % prevalence vitamin A deficiency subset Tuberculosis case contact study contact latent TB ( unpublished data ) . The mechanism benefit vitamin A clinical outcome especially related measles largely unknown tuberculosis yet prove . However , likely related influence immune system.In experimental animal model , vitamin A promotes differentiation cytokine secretion macrophage may regulate secretion pro-inflammatory cytokine e.g . TNF-alpha IL-6 . child . Vitamin A supplementation report promote lymphogenesis induce high proportion CD4 naïve T-cells ( CD4+ CD45RA ) . In addition , quality T-cell function may also affect Vitamin A.There data indicate IFN-gamma production decrease vitamin A deficient child optimal normal child . Immune responses PBMCs non-deficient child stimulate specific antigen bias towards IFN-gamma , less IL-10 IL-4 . This cytokine profile reminiscent decrease Treg differentiation and/or Th1-type immune response induce vitamin A , require protection intracellular pathogen M.tb . Indeed , data previous study suggest initial decrease Treg induction contact TB case associate protection progression TB disease To best knowledge unaware trial vitamin A modulation immune response associate progression active disease child latent TB . We conduct parallel group comparison dose 200,000 IU Vitamin A supplementation placebo latently infect child age 5-14 year evaluate qualitative quantitative modulation T-cell responses clinical disease progression .</detailed_description>
