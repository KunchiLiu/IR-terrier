	<brief_summary>Lead accumulate bone . During pregnancy , physiologic change occur prompt bone resorption order provide calcium grow fetal skeleton also release lead store bone pregnant woman 's circulation . We previously demonstrate lead store mobilize circulation pregnant woman pose major threat fetal development . This particularly unfortunate since bone lead store , accumulate , persist decade , thereby jeopardize pregnancy woman even current lead exposure subside . What do many thousand woman lead exposure grow want healthy child ? To address question , 2000 , project embark randomize intervention trial test whether bedtime nutritional supplement 1,000 mg calcium significantly reduce fetal lead exposure toxicity suppress bone resorption pregnant mother .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent evidence indicate marked increase mobilization lead maternal bone store circulation pregnancy lactation . Furthermore , data group others indicate phenomenon carry significant risk fetal toxicity form growth ( decrease birth weight , head circumference , birth length ) subsequent cognitive development . These finding pose major public health problem , even among society decline lead exposure , give persistence pocket high lead exposure ( include community live proximity hazardous waste ) well long residence time lead bone ( year decades ) . One possible strategy suppress mobilization maternal bone lead store pregnancy nutritional intervention . We conduct randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial dietary supplement contain 1,200 milligrams calcium mean suppress bone resorption result mobilization lead bone plasma pregnancy , breast milk postpartum period . We take maternal measurement pre-pregnancy postpartum bone lead use K-x-ray fluorescence technology ; bone resorption ( assay N-telopeptide type I collagen urine [ urinary NTX ] ) , whole blood lead , plasma lead ( use special collection technique measure IDTIMS ) pre-pregnancy , first , second , third trimester one four month postpartum ; breast milk lead level one four month postpartum . We measure maternal plasma breast milk lead level direct source fetal infant lead exposure , recent research suggest maternal venous blood lead level adequately reflect either parameter . We test hypothesis supplement significantly decrease urinary NTX , plasma lead , breast milk lead level . We also explore relationship plasma lead level birth anthropometry measure . This research , successful , may provide mean prevent secondary toxicity accumulate lead burden among woman reproductive age .</detailed_description>
