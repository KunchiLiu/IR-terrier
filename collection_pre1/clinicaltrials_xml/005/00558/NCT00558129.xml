	<brief_summary>To determine effectiveness X-STOP® implant equivalent ( non-inferior ) conventional laminectomy patient lumbar spinal stenosis measure Zurich Claudication Questionnaire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects X-STOP® Versus Laminectomy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical study describe herein aim compare surgical outcome X-STOP® Interspinous Process Decompression® ( IPD ) system implantation conventional laminectomy subject require surgical intervention due symptom lumbar spinal stenosis ( LSS ) confirm diagnosis MRI , X-ray CT . Patients LSS meeting entry criterion randomize either X-STOP® IPD laminectomy treatment . Patients remain blinded procedure receive . The primary study outcome group difference Zurich Claudication Questionnaire ( ZCQ ) 12 month post-operative . In addition , subject undergo follow-up assessment 2 week 2 , 12 24 month post-operative . The secondary objective compare safety profile radiographic outcome group use pre- post-operative MRI flexion/extension X-rays , measure change canal neuroforaminal cross sectional area spinal stability , respectively .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age &gt; 50 2 . Has complete least 6 month conservative therapy may include limited epidural steroid injection , oral steroid , NSAIDS , analgesic , physical therapy , and/or spinal manipulation . 3 . Symptoms leg/buttock/groin pain without back pain exacerbate lumbar extension relieve flexion . If back pain also present must partially relieve patient flex . 4 . Diagnosis NIC due lumbar stenosis 1 2 lumbar level confirm Xray , MRI CT. 5 . Subject surgical candidate disease severity justify BOTH laminectomy XSTOP IPD placement clinically appropriate treatment option . 6 . Baseline score &gt; 2.0 Physical Function domain Zurich Claudication Questionnaire ( ZCQ ) . Because postmarket study , Inclusion Criteria consistent FDA approve XSTOP indication use ( moderately impaired physical function ) , require ZCQ physical function score &gt; 2.0 . 7 . Subject able walk least 50 foot . 8 . Subject willing able comply require followup test expect physically able return evaluation schedule followup visit . 9 . Subject able understand risk benefit participate study . 10 . Subject understands sign study inform consent form . 1 . Spinal stenosis involve 2 lumbar level . 2 . Any previous lumbar spine surgery . 3 . Subject unremitting pain spinal position axial back pain without leg/buttock/groin pain . 4 . Evidence subject 's symptom due vascular claudication . 5 . Subject significant instability lumbar spine , e.g. , isthmic spondylolisthesis degenerative spondylolisthesis great Grade 1 ( scale 1 4 ) . 6 . Subject ankylose segment affect level ( ) . 7 . Subject significant scoliosis ( Cobb angle great 25 degree ) . 8 . Subject cauda equina syndrome define neural compression cause neurogenic bowel ( rectal incontinence ) bladder ( bladder retention incontinence ) dysfunction . 9 . Subject fix motor deficit know peripheral neuropathy . 10 . Subject degenerative neurologic disease . 11 . Subject mass lesion ( e.g . disc herniation , synovial cyst , spinal tumor ) . 12 . Any evidence spinal systemic infection . 13 . Subject history spinous process fracture par interarticularis fracture . 14 . Subject history radiographic evidence 1 osteoporotic fracture ( e.g. , vertebral , hip , wrist ) OR subject severe osteoporosis spine hip , define bone mineral density ( BMD ) spine hip 2.5 SD mean adult normal . If Investigator suspect osteoporosis , DEXA scan do . 15 . Subject know allergy implant material ( include titanium titanium alloy polyetheretherketone XSTOP IPD ) . 16 . Subject bleed disorder active systemic disease HIV , hepatitis , etc . 17 . Subject medical condition would limit availability followup . 18 . Subject recent history narcotic abuse ( i.e. , within last 3 year ) . 19 . Subject immunologically suppress , receive receive 7.5 milligram prednisone ( equivalent ) daily six month immediately prior enrollment . 20 .
