	<detailed_description>Studies show high-dose Methylprednisolone Rituximab use single agent effective relapsed refractory B-CLL . Methylprednisolone act independently p53 apoptosis pathway . The combination drug may improve response outcome previously treat high-risk B-CLL patient . Study Objectives Primary : To determine clinical benefit high-dose Methylprednisolone Rituximab previously treat high-risk B-CLL patient term clinical flowcytometric response rate . Secondary : To determine progression free overall survival . To characterize safety profile high-dose Methylprednisolone Rituximab . Patient Population Patients previously treat symptomatic high risk B-CLL 18 year age old . Study Duration The study period subject expect 21 month . Subjects receive up-to 6 cycle IV infusion Methylprednisolone Rituximab . Maximum duration treatment expect 9 month . All infusion study treatment administer medically qualified site staff inpatient outpatient clinic supervision Investigator . Subjects complete schedule visit later Study Month 21 , time enter long term follow period . Subjects follow every 3 month disease progression , initiation subsequent leukemia treatment survival , except case lose follow , subject withdraws inform consent . Study Design Phase II , multicenter , non-randomized , open label study . Maximum Recruitment Period 2 year Number Planned Subjects Approximately 50 patient .</detailed_description>
