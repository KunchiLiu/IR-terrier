	<brief_summary>Background : The brain release signal mark reward certain behavior . Some medication Parkinson disease ( PD ) cause patient engage compulsive behavior , possibly medication affect reward system . By use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , researcher study brain activity individual receive reward . Objectives : To learn brain people PD behave reward . To learn whether two common Parkinson medication ( levodopa pramipexole ) change behavior . To compare reward signal brain healthy volunteer reward signal brain people PD . Eligibility : Women 50 80 year age men 45 80 year age . Participants divide healthy volunteer volunteer mild moderate PD . Design : Prescreening consist neurological examination series question gamble habit drug alcohol use . Participation TMS study involve computer game simulation slot machine : - Before simulation , participant receive TMS establish baseline response rate . - During simulation , participant play game receive real money . TMS administer patient three different condition : - TMS administer patient take Parkinson medication . - TMS administer patient take levodopa . - TMS administer patient take pramipexole ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The role mesencephalic dopamine neuron reward process establish primate use electrophysiological technique human use functional neuroimaging . Their role think dual : ) show sustained activity expectation future reward ii ) phasic response reward . Animal data indicate neuron , locate midbrain area A8-10 , behave single functional unit activate . They rich projection prefrontal motor cortex synapse interneurons cortical pyramidal cell , produce primarily inhibition . Though function fully understood , projection clearly play important role motivation learn . We recently develop pair paradigm detect reward relate signal primary motor cortex , transcranial magnetic stimulation use measure brief event . So far , test healthy volunteer ; intend study Parkinson disease ( PD ) patient order help clarify role dopamine effect reward . The Parkinson patient test levodopa/carbidopa dopamine agonist medication . Our hypothesis dopamine reward relate signal alter level evocable inhibition primary motor cortex . Using behavioral paradigm deliver intermittent reward , aim demonstrate , treat untreated PD patient difference amount cortical inhibition , ) reward expect compare reward expect ii ) reward compare unrewarded trial . We also aim demonstrate difference response healthy control .</detailed_description>
