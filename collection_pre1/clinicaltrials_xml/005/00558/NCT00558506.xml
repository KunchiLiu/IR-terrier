	<brief_title>Pilot Open Label Clinical Trial With Abatacept Ankylosing Spondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical manifestation prevalence ankylose spondylitisAnkylosing spondylitis ( AS ) chronic inflammatory disease affect primarily spine sacroiliac joint , extraspinal structure peripheral joint , enthesis ( insertion tendons/ligaments bone ) , eye ( uveitis ) aorta also involve . There strong association AS MHC class I antigen HLA-B27 positive 90-95 % patient . About 5 % HLA-B27-positve individual develop ankylose spondylitis lifetime , start 95 % age young 45 year . The overall prevalence AS estimate 0.2 1.2 % . These difference mainly explain difference HLA-B27 prevalence different population . Current treatment ankylose spondylitisRecent ASAS/EULAR recommendation treatment AS state predominant axial manifestation two group effective drug : NSAIDs , recently , TNF-blockers 1 . Thus , contrast rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory rheumatic disease SLE treatment DMARDs play role mangement AS . Most recently , could show three open label study drug leflunomide2 , IL-RA anakinra3 methotrexate 4 effective AS . Sulfasalazine , DMARD often use treatment AS , , , also limited efficacy . About 20-30 % AS patient estimate potential candidate treatment TNF-blockers disease still active despite adequate therapy NSAIDs . From AS patient treat TNF-blockers , 50 % show 50 % improvement disease acitivity ( BASDAI ) , 50 % . Especially latter patient suboptimal response anti-TNF agent alternative treatment option urgently need . Evidence ankylose spondylitis autoimmune disease thepotential role T cell pathogenesisWe argue already 10 year ago autoimmunity play important role pathogenesis ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) . Although direct evidence , nearly 'suspected ' autoimmune disease , autoimmune response AS propose repeatedly last year cartilage likely target autoimmune response AS . Histological study magnet resonance imaging investigation suggest primary site inflammation cartilage/bone interphase . Mononuclear cell infiltrate mainly find cartilage subchondral bone . In early active sacroiliitis , T cell macrophages dominant infiltrates underline relevance specific cellular immune response . This back recent study group demonstrate mononuclear infiltrates ( include CD4+ CD8+ T cell ) cartilage investigate femoral head facette joint ( small joint spine ) obtain surgery number AS patient 5,6 . The presence T cell MNC infiltrate strongly dependent presence cartilage surface femoral head , suggest cartilage could indeed stimulus target cellular immune response . Furthermore , T cell response demonstrate proteoglycan ( important cartilage protein ) human arthritides include ankylose spondylitis . We could also recently demonstrate CD4+ CD8+ T cell response proteoglycan ( aggrecan ) derive peptides peripheral blood CD8+ T cell response collagen VI derive peptide synovial fluid AS patient . Thus , finding suggest chronic , probably T cell mediate , immune response cartilage relevant pathogenesis AS.Further strong evidence crucial role T cell pathogenesis AS come , addition experimental data discuss , association AS MHC class I antigen HLA-B27 . Because natural function HLA molecules presentation peptide T cell postulate presentation yet unknown peptide T cell might link explain HLA-B27 association , although direct evidence hypothesis still miss . However , hypothesis back lack association HLA-B27 subtypes *B2706 *B2709 , differ susceptible subtypes 1 ( 2 ) amino acid substitution bottom peptide bind groove . Thus , subtypes might present arthritogenic peptide . Based described finding role T-cells ankylose spondylitis assume Abatacept potential effective drug treat ankylose spondylitis.The rheumatology group Charité , Campus Benjamin Franklin , large experience conduction clinical trial , especially ankylose spondylitis , include treatment biologicals . The infliximab trial finally lead approval infliximab indication ankylose spondylitis . Most study conduct investigator ' initiate ( sponsor ) trial . From trial know placebo response rate rather small patient active ankylose spondylitis . The aim propose trial evaluate short-term efficacy safety treatment active AS ( BASDAI &gt; 4 despite adequate therapy NSAIDs ) pilot open label trial abatacept . If clear response ( see sample size justification ) . acceptable safety reach study would follow double blind placebo-controlled trial.We propose treat open label pilot study two group patient : 1 . TNFa-blocker failure ( mean patient show adequate response TNFa-blocker treatment accord international ASAS recommendation 7 ; mean patient discontinue side effect ) 2 . TNFa-blocker naïve patient . We expect gain important information potential indication treatment AS abatacept already relatively simple study design small number patient ( N= 30 total ) .Research hypothesis The aim propose trial evaluate short-term efficacy safety treatment active AS ( BASDAI &gt; 4 despite adequate therapy NSAIDs ) pilot open label trial abatacept . If clear response ( see sample size justification ) acceptable safety reach study would follow double blind placebo-controlled trial .</detailed_description>
