	<brief_summary>This trial examine safety , efficacy feasibility single dose intravenous zoledronic acid maintenance skeletal integrity frail , institutionalized woman , risk deleterious outcome osteoporosis . The investigator test hypothesis institutionalize elderly woman single dose intravenous zoledronic acid therapy : ( 1 ) efficacious demonstrate stability improvement bone mass measurement reduction bone turnover ; ( 2 ) safe feasible ; ( 3 ) provide estimate vertebral nonvertebral fracture reduction cohort use planning future study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>We include elderly woman 65 year old reside nursing home assist living facility know history osteoporosis , determine history adult fragility fracture bone mineral density criterion osteoporosis ( Tscore 2.5 total hip , femoral neck spine ) low bone mass ( Tscore &lt; 2.0 total hip , femoral neck spine , consistent National Osteoporosis Foundation Treatment guideline ) . If participant 's spine hip evaluable ( due surgery , calcification , artifact scan area , scoliosis , etc . ) , may include study Tscore â‰¤ 2.0 forearm . Elders choose without consideration ethnic racial background . We choose frail , institutionalize woman 7085 % osteoporosis age group substantially undertreated . We include qualify , able weight bear assist transfer chair , endure result maximum generalizability nursing home population whole . Children exclude frail , institutionalized elder . Men exclude become postmenopausal less likely become osteoporotic . We exclude institutionalized woman subacute illness expect survive discharge less 2 year . We also exclude patient contraindication bisphosphonate , hypocalcemia , allergy , pervious adverse event ( exclude gastrointestinal disorder ) , currently oral bisphosphonate . We exclude patient calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/mm . We exclude woman schedule need tooth extraction procedure associate osteonecrosis jaw patient cancer give multiple course high dose intravenous bisphosphonates . We screen condition detailed history , physical exam ( include dental exam ) , chart review , baseline laboratory analysis , include BUN/creatinine , liver function test , TSH , calcium , PTH , 25hydroxyvitamin D , alkaline phosphatase baseline calculate creatinine clearance . Participants vitamin D level &lt; 20 ng/ml treat vitamin D 50,000 IU/wk 8 week addition calcium . Vitamin D rechecked patient enrol vitamin D level &gt; 20 ng/ml . Patients allow continue certain medication know affect bone mineral metabolism ( e.g . glucocorticoid , anticonvulsant ) use common population . ( In facility , 2.9 % patient use glucocorticoid 7.2 % use antiepileptic drug . ) In addition , woman treat past present osteoporosis agent , estrogen/progesterone , raloxifene , calcitonin , allow participate continue therapy prescribe physician . However , patient currently bisphosphonates great 1 year previous 2 year prior enrollment , exclude bisphosphonates long act . Patients allow wear hip pad prescribe physician . If parathyroid hormone , may participate , tell monotherapy parathyroid hormone beneficial combination therapy parathyroid hormone alendronate , previously demonstrate .</criteria>
