	<brief_title>Treatment Carpal Tunnel Syndrome With Dynamic Splinting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study compare efficacy treat Carpal tunnel Syndrome Dynasplint® Systems device compare non-treatment control group utilize randomize , control , cross-over study design . The dependant variable study patient 's score Levine-Katz disability pain scale test , change nerve conduction median nerve test upon diagnosis . The independent variable include three different patient group separate randomization . The first group subject ( select randomly ) fit therapeutic , functional Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint® versus second , control patient treat dynamic splinting first sixty ( 60 ) day . After initial sixty ( 60 ) day , original control patient fit functional Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint® system allow examiner evaluate variance subject group , allow third group Cross-Over group . The METHODS multi-centered study include recruit patient multiple hand surgeon neurologists patient diagnose follow physician ' physical examination nerve conduction test median nerve . The subject brief study sign inform consent require IRB participate . Subjects consent give Levine-Katz disability pain scale test , prior fit Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint® Subjects taught use Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint® properly fit Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint® subject require complete weekly report show compliance wear treatment schedule , must attend regular , monthly examination refer physician . After initial sixty ( 60 ) day study subject repeat three lead conduction test median nerve . Control subject point fit Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint® system become Cross-Over subject final nerve conduction test administer worn Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint® system sixty ( 60 ) day . Upon discharge study subject also retake Levine-Katz disability pain scale test . Eighty ( 80 ) SUBJECTS recruit follow diagnosis CTS ( use nerve conduction test median nerve differential diagnosis ) group assignment determine randomization follow patient 's completion inform consent require IRB . All patient randomly select start experimental group fit functional Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint® control group subject fit sixty ( 60 ) day . When ultimately fit , categorized `` Cross-Over '' subject measure continue variance group . The DURATION patient enrol study sixty ( 60 ) day experimental subject control subject spend first sixty ( 60 ) day control role without treatment . However , follow sixty day initial control subject refit functional Carpal Tunnel Dynasplint® `` Cross-Over '' subject additional sixty ( 60 ) day , make control subject duration study 120 day .</detailed_description>
