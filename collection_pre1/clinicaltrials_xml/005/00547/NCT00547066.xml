	<brief_title>Study Veltuzumab ( hA20 ) Different Doses Patients With ITP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal current treatment guideline patient chronic adult ITP maintain platelet level 30 x 109/L . The conventional first-line therapy corticosteroid without intravenous immunoglobulin , many patient relapse steroid taper . Standard therapy splenectomy , patient refractory ITP respond require therapy . Unfortunately , immunosuppressive agent available treatment typically produce short-term response . Because lack medical option first-line therapy , target population first study anti-CD20 immunotherapy hA20 adult patient chronic ITP fail least one standard ITP therapy ( i.e. , receive least one standard ITP therapy present platelet level 30 x 109/L ) . In autoimmune disease , rituximab well anti-CD20 antibody currently consider commercialization focus different dose schedule rheumatoid arthritis , use fix dosage rather variable dos base body surface area . In addition , recent study newer anti-CD20 antibody rheumatoid arthritis report low dos indeed appear effective administered twice , 2 week apart . Based upon consideration , patient study receive hA20 twice , 2 week apart , administer one 3 dose level .</detailed_description>
