	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma pancreas . The site primary lesion confirm endoscopically , radiologically , surgically pancreas . 2 . Patients must deem unresectable due involvement critical vasculature , adjacent organ invasion , presence metastasis , medical condition make surgical resection unfavorable . 3 . Patients must primary metastatic lesion measurable least one dimension RECIST criterion within 4 week prior entry study 4 . More 4 week must elapse time major surgery completion last dose chemotherapy , radiation therapy , investigational therapy patient must adequately recover effect . 5 . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month . 6 . Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70 % . 7 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm3 platelet &gt; 70,000/mm3 total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . albumin &gt; 2.8 mg/dL 8 . Patients must adequate clot function ( platelet &gt; 70k ; INR &lt; 1.4 ; PTT &lt; 60 ) . 9 . Age &gt; 18 year . 10 . The effect DCs develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 11 . No history autoimmune disease . 12 . Ability understand study protocol willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients receive anticoagulation therapy . 2 . Patients receive prior gemcitabine radiation therapy pancreatic bed 3 . Patients receive investigational agent . 4 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude poor prognosis often develop progressive neurological dysfunction would confound evaluation neurological adverse effect . 5 . Uncontrolled concurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 6 . Patients test positive Hepatitis B virus , Hepatitis C virus HIV .</criteria>
