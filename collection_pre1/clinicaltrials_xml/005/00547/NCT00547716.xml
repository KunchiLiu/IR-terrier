	<brief_summary>Hepatitis C virus infection common blood-borne infection United States lead cause chronic liver disease affect 130 million people around world . It estimate 1.6 % US population may affect Hepatitis C infection . The recommended treatment approve condition use interferon ribavirin . In patient chronic Hepatitis C , tend accumulation fat liver . Fatty liver associate failure treatment . The accumulation fat liver blame particular type fat call triglyceride . Fish oil , reduce type fat call VLDL , low triglyceride concentration much 50 percent . This study seek determine administration fish oil along standard treatment patient Hepatitis C increase treatment response rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Omega-3 Fatty Acids ( Fish Oil ) Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatic steatosis may present 66 % case chronic Hepatitis C infection . Previous study report steatosis independent predictor treatment failure patient chronic hepatitis C infection . The pathogenesis hepatic steatosis chronic Hepatitis C infection fully elucidate . Hepatic steatosis manifestation excessive triglyceride accumulation liver . Hypertriglyceridemia may benefit Omega-3 fatty acid ( fish oil supplement ) , reduce VLDL production lower serum triglyceride concentration much 50 percent . The treatment chronic hepatitis C result average sustained viral response rate 54 % -63 % . We find response rate around 50 % treatment patient . We hypothesize give omega-3 fatty acid along interferon therapy patient Hepatitis C , may able increase treatment response rate . Thus , purpose study look effect omega 3 fatty acid early sustain viral response rate patient chronic HCV infection .</detailed_description>
