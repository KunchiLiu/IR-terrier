	<brief_summary>An experimental drug call L-DOPS increase production body messenger chemical call norepinephrine . Cells brain make norepinephrine often go Parkinson disease . The exact consequence loss unknown , may relate symptom fatigue , depression , decrease attention occur commonly Parkinson disease . This study explore effect L-DOPS conjunction carbidopa entacapone , drug use treat Parkinson disease . We wish find effect increase norepinephrine production brain whether carbidopa entacapone augment effect . Volunteers study must least 18 year age able give consent participate study . To participate study , volunteer must discontinue use alcohol , tobacco , certain herbal medicine dietary supplement , must also taper discontinue certain kind medication might interfere result study . Candidates screen medical history physical exam . Participants admit National Institutes Health Clinical Center two week test . The study three test phase randomly choose order participant : - Single dose L-DOPS - Single dose L-DOPS conjunction carbidopa - Single dose L-DOPS conjunction entacapone Each phase last two day , washout day phase drug give test perform . In phase , participant undergo series test measurement , include blood pressure electrocardiogram test . Participants healthy volunteer also blood drawn undergo lumbar puncture ( also know spinal tap ) obtain spinal fluid chemical test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Augmenting Effects L-DOPS With Carbidopa Entacapone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : L-DOPS synthetic chemical convert norepinephrine ( NE ) . NE key messenger sympathetic nervous system . Failure sympathetic nervous system result orthostatic hypotension ( OH ) , fall blood pressure person stand . Patients Parkinson disease ( PD ) often OH related loss sympathetic nerve NE deficiency . L-DOPS help treat OH patient . Drugs use commonly treat PD , however , probably influence effect L-DOPS . Carbidopa , combine levodopa ( brand name Sinemet ) standard treatment PD , might prevent L-DOPS turn NE outside brain therefore interfere effect L-DOPS blood pressure . Entacapone ( brand name Comtan ) might augment production NE dose L-DOPS , decrease metabolic breakdown L-DOPS . The first goal study test hypotheses patient neurogenic OH . NE also chemical messenger brain think participate variety neuropsychiatric phenomena vigilance , mood , memory , transmission pain sensation . Patients OH evidence central NE deficiency . A second goal study determine whether depressed mood , apathy , fatigue , pain improve L-DOPS treatment patient . A third goal test whether carbidopa entacapone , enhance delivery L-DOPS brain , augment L-DOPS effect symptom . Finally , fourth goal verify carbidopa entacapone augment neurochemical index central neural production NE dose L-DOPS . Study Population : The subject patient PD+NOH , MSA+NOH , pure autonomic failure ( PAF ) ; healthy volunteer . A total 55 patient 15 healthy volunteer enrol . Design : Patients healthy volunteer enter Protocol undergo clinical laboratory evaluation NIH Clinical Protocol 03-N-0004 , confirm diagnosis , identify NOH , provide data related central peripheral NE production . Each subject serf control . Subjects test take single oral dose 400 mg L-DOPS randomize crossover design study three treatment condition L-DOPS alone , L-DOPS carbidopa ( 200 mg ) , L-DOPS entacapone ( 200 mg ) . Healthy volunteer CSF drawn lumbar puncture fluoroscopic guidance 3 hour administration drug combination . Outcome Measures : Primary : Hemodynamics , plasma catechols metabolite , non-motor symptom checklist Secondary : ( In healthy volunteer ) CSF catechols metabolites Other : ( In patient dysarthria ) Speech</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All subject Protocol already undergone clinical laboratory evaluation call Clinical Protocol 03N0004 , `` Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Primary Chronic Autonomic Failure . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Age : People younger 18 year old exclude . Risk : A candidate subject exclude , judgment Principal Investigator Clinical Director , Protocol participation would place subject substantially increase acute medical risk . This include risk associate air travel NIH . A candidate subject exclude , opinion Principal Investigator Clinical Director , medical risk outweigh potential scientific benefit . Disqualifying Conditions : A candidate subject exclude disqualify condition . Examples disqualify condition hepatic renal failure , symptomatic congestive heart failure , severe anemia , psychosis , refractory ventricular arrhythmia , symptomatic coronary heart disease . Persons dementia interfere ability provide inform consent exclude . If dementia suspect , score minimental examination less 24 , bioethics consult obtain . Medications : A candidate subject exclude clinical consideration require patient continue treatment drug likely interfere scientific result . Examples would treatment levodopa/carbidopa tricyclic antidepressant . Patients know suspected allergy hypersensitivity test drug exclude . Patients unable discontinue nicotine alcohol temporarily exclude . Patients discontinue medication patient patient doctor discus Dr. Goldstein , Principal Investigator , Sandra Pechnik , Research Nurse . If decided discontinuing medication would unsafe , patient exclude study . Subjects must discontinue use alcohol tobacco throughout period test . PD patient difficulty tolerate withdrawal levodopa/carbidopa treatment may treat dopamine receptor agonist study , dose remain . Tricyclic antidepressant , drug inhibit Laromaticaminoacid decarboxylase catecholOmethyltransferase , levodopa , carbidopa withdrawn throughout period study . Withdrawal antiparkinsonian medication may worsen rigidity , bradykinesia , tremor . These effect think adversely influence longterm course disease . Withdrawal tricyclic antidepressant may worsen depression . Drug withdrawal do inpatient . Alternative drug , serotonin reuptake blocker , antianxiety agent , dopamine receptor agonist , may use constant dos study . Herbal Medicines Dietary Supplements : Certain herbal medicine dietary supplement know suspect interfere experimental result , herbal medicine dietary supplement must discontinue enrollment study . For many herbal medicine dietary supplement , mechanism action therefore possible effect experimental result unknown . In case subject wish continue herbal medicine dietary supplement study , search available medical literature fail identify effect know expect interfere experimental result , subject may participate . Practical Limitations : Subjects feel would difficult insert catheter vein exclude . Subjects expect clinically tolerate lying still supine test exclude . Pregnancy : Pregnant lactate woman exclude . Women childbearing potential must negative urine blood test pregnancy do within 24 hour test involve radioactivity experimental drug . PostLumbar Puncture Headache : Candidate Healthy Volunteers exclude headache require blood patch lumbar puncture fluoroscopic guidance .</criteria>
