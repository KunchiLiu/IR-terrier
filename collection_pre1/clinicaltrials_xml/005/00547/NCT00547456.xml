	<criteria>Adult male female diagnosis COPD screen nocturnal desaturation indicate . Clinical stability define absence treatment change need acute care within last two month . Weight stable , within 5 % , previous three month measure office visit . Willingness participate clinical study . Acute illness within precede 2 month . Patients receive systemic glucocorticoid therapy within past month . Clinical and/or overnight pulse oximetry evidence obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . The Multivariate Apnea Prediction Questionnaire ( MAP ) give patient assess likelihood OSA base common symptom disorder . While recognize screen instrument evaluate specifically COPD patient , ass common sign symptom OSA . This tool show identify OSA 95 % sensitivity ( 63 ) . In addition , ODI 4 % determine overnight pulse oximetry record . Patients exclude MAP score &gt; 0.4 ODI 4 % &gt; 15/hour , suggestive concomitant presence obstructive sleep apnea . Hypercapnia define PaCO2 &gt; 50 mmHg rest arterial blood gas Previous diagnosis erythrocytosis , pulmonary vascular disease , pleural effusion , ischemic heart disease congestive heart failure . No chronic illness know affect inflammatory response infection , collagen vascular disease , liver disease , thyroid disease diabetes . Primary care pulmonary physician refusal . Patient refusal reason . Lack capacity participate inform consent process .</criteria>
