	<brief_summary>This research study Phase I/II clinical trial . It do determine best dose investigational drug ( P276-00 ) use safely . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study research doctor try find information ; safe dose use , side effect may cause effective treat relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma . A majority multiple myeloma patient overexpress protein play role regulate body 's cell cycle call Cyclin D1 . The study drug P276-00 Cyclin D1 inhibitor investigation treatment solid tumor . The researcher therefore believe Cyclin D1 study therapeutic target myeloma . In research study , look high dose P276-00 give safely see well work</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Safety Efficacy P276-00 Subjects With Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pre clinical data demonstrate P276-00 selective Cdk4-D1 Cdk1-B inhibitor potent cytotoxic effect MM cell include sensitive ( MM1.S , RPMI 8226 , OPM1 , OPM2 ) resistant ( MM1.R , Dox-40 , LR5 ) conventional chemotherapy well mouse xenograft model . The IC50 effect 300-1000 nM vitro , potential dos evaluate clinical study achieve concentration . This evidence support rationale evaluate effect P276-000 patient relapsed/refractory MM order determine safety tolerability well pharmacokinetics potential efficacy . The current study design allow adequate assessment patient safety term potential adverse effect P276-00 .</detailed_description>
