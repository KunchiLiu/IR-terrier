	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Stereotactic body radiation therapy may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Giving erlotinib together stereotactic body radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give erlotinib together stereotactic body radiation therapy work treat patient locally advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Non-Small Call Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate effect erlotinib stereotactic body radiotherapy 6-month progression-free survival patient locally advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer . Secondary - To describe actuarial rate in-field local control out-of-field disease progression patient treat regimen . - To evaluate safety regimen patient . - To evaluate overall survival patient treat regimen . - To evaluate duration erlotinib usage time initiation third-line systemic therapy ( chemotherapy biologic agent ) patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 1-4 week initiation erlotinib hydrochloride , patient undergo stereotactic body radiotherapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
