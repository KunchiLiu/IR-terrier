	<brief_title>PET Imaging Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptors Patients With Carotid Atherosclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective Inflammation vascular wall play important role pathophysiology atherosclerosis , include development plaque , plaque destabilization rupture . Clinical basic scientific data demonstrate importance peripheral white blood cell process . Therefore , noninvasive method detect inflammatory activity atherosclerosis may great value help determine prognosis , direct therapy perhaps assess novel therapy stabilization atherosclerotic plaque . The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ( PBR ) distinct central benzodiazepine receptor associate GABAA receptor associate immune function . PBR express macrophage , therefore , may clinically useful marker detect inflammation . Our preliminary autoradiographic data demonstrate specific PBR binding carotid atherosclerosis sample . Though PBR image vivo positron emission tomography ( PET ) use [ ( 11 ) C ] 1- ( 2-chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl ) -3-isoquinoline carboxamide ( PK11195 ) , develop new ligand , [ ( 11 ) C ] N-acetyl-N- ( 2-methoxybenzyl ) -2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine ( PBR28 ) show great specific signal [ ( 11 ) C ] PK11195 non-human primate . The objective protocol assess utility [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 PET detect inflammation unstable atherosclerosis plaque large vessel inflammation . Study population Twenty patient carotid atherosclerosis , 20 patient large vessel vasculitis include Takayasu 's Giant Cell arteritis , 20 age-matched healthy subject one PET scan . Design A [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 PET scan [ 18 F ] fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) PET scan perform patient carotid atherosclerosis . If patient endarterectomy PET scan , endarterectomy sample evaluate vitro autoradiography use [ 3H ] PK 11195 immunohistological stain macrophage marker . Patients large vessel vasculitis healthy subject also [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 PET scan [ 18 F ] FDG PET scan . Outcome measure Binding [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 atherosclerotic lesion , aortic arch branch compare bind contralateral carotid artery healthy subject . Binding [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 also compare accumulation [ 18 F ] FDG region . In addition , patient atherosclerosis endarterectomy , bind atherosclerotic lesion compare immunohistological staining macrophage marker .</detailed_description>
