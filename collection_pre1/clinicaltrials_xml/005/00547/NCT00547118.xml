	<brief_summary>1 ) To examine efficacy rimonabant decrease weight metabolic parameters/cardiovascular disease risk people schizophrenia receive second generation antipsychotic 2 ) To examine safety tolerability rimonabant adjunctive agent decrease weight metabolic risk people schizophrenia 3 ) To examine efficacy rimonabant neurocognitive impairment people schizophrenia treat second-generation antipsychotic ( secondary outcome ) 4 ) To examine efficacy rimonabant patient perceive health outcome quality life ( secondary outcome ) 5 ) To test effect rimonabant cigarette smoking , nicotine dependence nicotine crave people schizophrenia 6 ) To examine effect rimonabant food satiety people schizophrenia There increase awareness problem metabolic issue people schizophrenia renew focus physical health care population . There under-treatment , general , medical condition people schizophrenia , increase mortality natural cause . People schizophrenia risk develop obesity due many factor include inactive lifestyle , poor dietary choice , side effect commonly use atypical antipsychotic . Metabolic syndrome discuss cardiology endocrinology two decade , prevalence mentally ill fully realize . Diabetes mellitus may twice prevalent among patient schizophrenia general population metabolic syndrome probably even prevalent diabetes among people schizophrenia . There opportunity address serious problem . A new drug , rimonabant , recently approve several European Latin American country . This drug represent first new class psychoactive drug witch may improve metabolic problem decrease appetite drive . This may also help decrease drive cigarette use , also great problem people schizophrenia . Is safe effective treatment population ? This study propose test question rapid study , develop basis future work important area .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Rimonabant , Weight Metabolic Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part I 2-week evaluation phase . In Part I , subject undergo diagnostic interview symptom treatment along medical , side effect measure , neuropsychological test ( test memory , attention , motor task skill ) . An electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , urine sample , 3 tablespoon blood take laboratory test . Women pregnancy test . This part study 3-4 visit . The time visit 8 hour . Part II 16-week treatment phase subject randomly assign either rimonabant placebo 16-week period . The medication give unmarked capsule subject know medication receiving . Only pharmacist know medication subject receive . If emergency occur break blind give appropriate care . This phase require one visit every week visit may take 2-3 hour . Subjects examine every week check symptom side effect . Subjects symptoms evaluate use specially design rating scale , ask daily experience feeling . Evaluations occur every 4 week may take 2 hour . At week 8 week 16 laboratory test repeat . These test compare baseline test take Part I . The end study test may take total 8 hour may require 3-4 visit . All test do research purpose would perform subject participate study . The total number visit request study 16-20 . When subject undergo neuropsychological testing , examine ability learn remember number word pay attention quickly perform motor task . A motor task use hand perform task place pegs piece wood . These test take 2 hour do begin Part I end Part II . Diet exercise counsel hold weekly group individual . Sessions focus topic calorie , fat content , portion control determine healthy weight . We request participant maintain food diary exercise approximately 30 minutes/3 time per week . Subjects encourage attend counseling session . Transportation available subject . If patient attend session , reeducated importance attend session time clinical ratings.Subjects discharge study attend session . Randomization do use permuted block randomization system , stratified clozapine/olanzapine treatment baseline . Treatment assignment order random within block , total number patient assign treatment equal . The block size vary size 2 4 random sequence . The unblinded pharmacist notify treatment assignment , inform unblinded pharmacist site study medication dispense . In emergency , research staff able contact pharmacy unblinding . Rimonabant available 20 mg capsule match placebo . For outpatient study medication dispense weekly basis plus two extra day medication . Inpatient subject receive study medication daily Maryland Psychiatric Research Center ( MPRC ) Treatment Research Program ( TRP ) central pharmacy non-blind pharmacist . The blind broken medical emergency require information . If occurs , patient withdrawn study . All raters , investigator staff blind treatment assignment except pharmacist . The pharmacist participate assess primary symptom side effect dependent variable conveys information treatment assignment patient staff except medical emergency . Patients receive 75 % assign medication consider compliant . Outpatient compliance monitor weekly pill count subject interview . Inpatient compliance monitor inpatient medication record . If patient observe non-compliant discussed patient plan formulate bring patient back within compliance parameter . For outpatient plan may include contact patient caretaker schedule increase clinic visit . These monitoring procedure use MPRC study result high level compliance . Compliance pattern carefully monitor treatment group describe part presentation study result . Satiety define reduced willingness eat meal , due sickness extraneous factor think sensation fullness . A preload test meal use study . The preload fix amount food give participant consume entirety . The test meal food food serve , follow preload , sufficient quantity participant eat much desire . The amount consume test meal measure used index satiety . Likert Visual Analog Scales ( VAS ) also use . We employ preload-test meal paradigm along rating scale present study investigate effect rimonabant satiety signal . The test occur baseline , week 8 , week 16 see effect change . All three test occasion . Participants arrive skip breakfast give preload 12 oz . Ensure ( 375 kcal ) serve chilled large , plastic cup . Hunger rating take baseline , every 30 minute 90 minute . After 60 minute test meal consist pre-weighed bowl Reduced Fat Wheat Thins Nilla Wafers give . These keep separate bowl exact caloric consumption measure . The test meal serve 12 oz . water serve chilled large plastic cup . Satiety assess quantity Wheat Thins , Nilla Wafers , water consume difference hunger rating score baseline time point . About 75 % subject smoker . Smoking measure perform &gt; 8 ppm CO expire breath smoke least 5 cigarette daily . One approach study tobacco crave laboratory compare smoker response expose neutral smoking-related vivo cue . In vivo `` real-life '' cue either presented experimenter involve manipulation material participant . For study , smoke cigarette baseline ( 15 minute test begin ) , patient ask complete Tobacco Craving Questionnaire ( TCQ ) Positive Negative Affect Schedule ( PANAS ) . Participants expose two experimental trial present random order : 1 ) smoking cue , 2 ) neutral cues.Each trial last 20 minute . Participants complete TCQ PANAS immediately 10 20 minute cue exposure . There rest period trial . During rest period , patient complete study assessment last 30-60 minute . After assessment , patient smoke complete rating cue reactivity session second random condition time point ( baseline , immediately , 10 20 minute ) .Trials begin experimenter place tray contain opaque cover table front participant . In smoke cue condition , pack participant preferred brand cigarette lighter ashtray tray cover . In neutral cue condition , pack unsharpened pencil pencil sharpener cover . When instructed , participant lift cover tray . In smoke cue condition , participant take one cigarette pack light without puff hold look . At end exposure period participant extinguish cigarette , replace cover tray . In neutral cue condition , participant take one pencil pack sharpen hold look . The Iowa Gambling Task ( IGT ) computer-administered cognitive test measure risk-reward decision-making . Performance impair patient brain lesion ventromedial prefrontal cortex people abuse alcohol , cocaine , marijuana , methamphetamine , opiate , multiple illegal drug . Patients schizophrenia show normal IGT performance study . In particular , adolescent patient adult catatonic schizophrenia show impairment . One study find IGT performance significantly correlate negative symptom . In study , subject take one two equivalent version IGT study entry study completion . Each task session take 30 minute . The Tobacco Craving Questionnaire ( TCQ ) questionnaire design assess current tobacco craving . Factor analysis 47-item TCQ result four factor : 1 ) emotionality , smoke anticipation relief withdrawal negative mood ; 2 ) expectancy , anticipation positive outcome smoke ; 3 ) compulsivity , inability control tobacco use ; 4 ) purposefulness , intention plan smoke positive outcome . We use 12-item version TCQ , comprise three item factor exhibit optimal within-factor reliability ( Cronbachs coefficient alpha ) inter-item correlation . The 12-item TCQ valid reliable 47-item version . TCQ item rat scale 1 strongly disagree 7 strongly agre . Factor scale score participant obtain sum three item . The PANAS 20-item scale 10 item describe positive mood ( enthusiastic , interested , determine , excite , inspire , alert , active , strong , proud , attentive ) 10 item describe negative mood ( scar , afraid , upset , distressed , jittery , nervous , ashamed , guilty , irritable , hostile ) . Each item rat 5-point scale ( , little , moderately , quite bit , extremely ) . The PANAS show high internal consistency test-retest reliability . Subjects leave study point . If participant experience worsen psychotic symptom ( relative baseline BPRS , increase 3 point OR increase 5 7 one follow BPRS item : somatic concern , conceptual disorganization , hostility , suspiciousness , hallucinatory behavior , unusual thought content OR increase 2 CGI global severity OR subject judge enter exacerbation his/her illness treat clinician ) , patient discontinue study . Other reason study termination include evidence suicidal thinking behavior , development worsen significant depressive symptom ( score point study &gt; 10 CDS 3 suicidal item ) , complete cessation eat drink &gt; 24 hour , pregnancy , blood pressure &gt; 165/95 three consecutive reading . Once participant discontinue study whatever reason , completion rating perform . This include laboratory test rating scale neurocognitive assessment . If patient prematurely terminate study , resume standard treatment . At end study patient option continue rimonabant FDA approve US . Other intervention improve weight metabolic profile discuss patient .</detailed_description>
