	<detailed_description>Since pacemaker implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICDs ) use , question external source interference could alter function event record property . Because device often intend life-saving , proper function critical importance . The literature document number common source possible interference . Interference MRI electrocautery observe ( 1 , 2 ) . Outside hospital , store security device personal digital assistant ( PDAs ) evaluate ( 3 , 4 ) . In 1997 , Hayes et al publish randomize , prospective trial conclude cellular telephone impact function pacemaker , seem effect significant distance ( 5 ) . They show phone use ear sufficiently far away prevent health risk recommend phone put shirt pocket use near device . Unlike phone , commonly hold ear , music available via portable MP3 player hold almost anywhere . Thaker et al state Apple iPods cause pacemaker interference 50 % patient , over-sensing 20 % patient , telemetry interference 29 % patient pacemaker inhibition 1.2 % patient ( 6 ) . The mean age sample 76.1 year +/- 8.6 year . We anticipate high proportion teenager kid pacemaker use portable MP3 player elderly adult population . Design Prospective observational study single tertiary care center . Subjects The electrophysiology department Children 's Hospital , Boston follow large number patient pacemaker ICDs . Approximately 15 patient see week clinic routine pacemaker evaluation . Entry Criteria We include first 100 patient pacemaker ICDs consent prospective trial . 1 . Consent participation 2 . Active pacemaker/ICD , function appropriately time interrogation base internal diagnostics judgment appropriate clinician ( electrophysiology nurse , fellow and/or attend . 3 . Normally function lead threshold time interrogation base internal diagnostics judgment appropriate clinician ( electrophysiology nurse , fellow and/or attend . Variables Primary Outcome Change pacemaker sense threshold , pace threshold , telemetry interference pacemaker inhibition . Methods Study investigator first obtain informed consent patient family , appropriate , assent child . At conclusion routine clinic visit , patient pacemaker attach appropriate proprietary interrogation system pacemaker device . We monitor pacemaker/ICD system place series portable music device various distance pacemaker/ICD system : ( 1 ) 2cm , ( 2 ) 30cm , ( 3 ) 100cm . At distance pacemaker re-interrogated change pacemaker sense threshold , pace threshold , telemetry interference pacemaker inhibition . At end test process , device remove near patient device interrogate assure device appropriate clinical setting . Risks We believe minimal risk associate study . The principle intervention placement music device near pacemaker/ICD time pacemaker monitoring . We consider risk similar risk encounter many patient currently use portable music device outside hospital . In addition , expect permanent change pacemaker ICD setting , threshold function . Statistical Issues Hypothesis Our hypothesis close approximation portable MP3 player interfere appropriate sense record pacemaker ICDs . Sample Size Power Calculations We intend conduct descriptive study , tabulate number time pacemaker ICD change sense threshold , pace threshold , telemetry interference pacemaker inhibition expose series portable MP3 player various distance . In addition , describe nature quantitative difference change . Because intend comparison significance control group , choose 100 patient reasonable sample size evaluate possible change pacemaker/ICD function .</detailed_description>
