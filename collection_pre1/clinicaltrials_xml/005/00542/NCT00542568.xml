	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Sustained Erythropoietin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia , common complication chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) result insufficient production hormone erythropoietin damage kidney lead decrease red blood cell production bone marrow . Replacement therapy recombinant human erythropoietin effectively correct anemia patient . However , despite availability recombinant human erythropoietin decade use CKD patient , two third patient initiate dialysis hematocrit le 30 % , three fourth hemoglobin ( Hb ) less 11 g/dL level recommend National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative . Treatment recombinant human erythropoietin typically involve subcutaneous ( SC ) administration regular interval follow frequent laboratory test monitor hemoglobin concentration . There need provide significantly improve care area use sustain therapy approach . EPODURE , autologous dermal biopump capable sustain secretion therapeutic EPO body , use small tissue explant patient 's skin . The EPODURE biopump harvest directly patient 's dermis local anesthetic . EPODURE Biopumps , produce ex vivo transduction MOs Helper Dependent Adenoviral EPO vector ( HDAd-EPO ) , express secretes EPO . The EPODURE Biopump subsequently implant subcutaneously back patient order provide continuous delivery know amount EPO .</detailed_description>
