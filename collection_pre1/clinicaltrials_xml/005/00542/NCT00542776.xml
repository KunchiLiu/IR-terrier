	<brief_title>Impact Immunosuppression IBD Patients Response Influenza Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza extremely contagious airborne disease cause influenza virus . It cause mild severe illness , even death . Patients inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) high risk get serious complication infect . Current guideline recommend influenza vaccine IBD patient . However , many IBD patient take immunosuppressive agent uncertain capacity mount truly protective response vaccination . This important area research IBD patient adequate immunological response , may need enhance response increase dosage give booster shot . Many clinician treat patient autoimmune disease ask vaccine safe effective . Many IBD patient receive vaccine without proper study perform answer question . The study propose important clinical public health significance . It step toward answer question whether vaccination influenza vaccine safe patient IBD patient different type immunosuppressive medication respond similarly respond well healthy control vaccine . There one million people United States diagnose IBD . Thus , information gain clinical study provide important knowledge physician care immunocompromised patient consider vaccination . Studies immunological response immunocompromised patient ( e.g. , transplant , HIV , oncology , chronic renal failure , SLE ) influenza vaccine demonstrate patient develop antibody titer protective level within 4-6 week . However , titer decrease compare healthy control , especially immunocompromised patient immunosuppressive agent . The frequency influenza immunocompromised patient low immunization almost major side effect vaccine . There little data immune response vaccination child IBD . One recently publish study compare influenza titer vaccination among 3 pediatric group : IBD patient receive immunosuppressive therapy , IBD patient receive immunosuppressive therapy , healthy control . All IBD patient study decrease response one three influenza strain compare control . IBD patient receive immunomodulators infliximab low immune response rate two influenza strain compare control . There difference immune response among IBD patient immunomodulators , IBD patient ASA , control . There difference rate adverse event IBD patient control The primary aim research measure seroprotection IBD patient immunosuppressive agent receive influenza vaccine . The hypothesis IBD patient immunosuppression impaired immunity , therefore , low seroprotection rate immunization compare IBD patient immunosuppression . If data available , also compare group historical healthy control give vaccine . The secondary aim determine antibody titer level side effect patient . The patient population include IBD patient immunosuppression IBD patient immunosuppression . Recruiting approximately 75 patient per group provide adequate power study . A blood sample take IBD patient evaluate baseline antibody level marker ( e.g. , CBC , ESR , albumin ) immediately immunization influenza vaccine . Lab test redrawn Month 1 ( 3-8 week ) evaluate level antibody titer follow marker . During study , track basic laboratory measure , disease status use Pediatric Crohn 's Disease Active Index Modified Harvey-Bradshaw Score UC , side effect adverse event vaccination .</detailed_description>

Actively previously follow gastroenterologist Children 's Hospital Boston 4 . On nonimmunosuppressants ( aminosalicylates , antibiotic , medication ) and/or immunosuppressant ( steroid , immunomodulators , TNFalpha inhibitor ) past 30 day . Standard concomitant medication ( e.g . antihistamine , acetaminophen ) allow . 1 . History bleed disorder would make hematoma likely ( eg hemophilia , von Willebrand 's disease ) 2 . Received influenza vaccination current influenza season 3 . Contraindications influenza vaccine ( severe allergic reaction prior influenza vaccine ) 4 . Fever within 48 hr prior injection 5 . Receipt another vaccination within 2 day influenza vaccine dose ( vaccine plan 2 day influenza vaccine )</criteria>
