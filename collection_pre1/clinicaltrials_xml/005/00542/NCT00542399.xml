	<brief_summary>An open-label , treat target , intervention study order compare metabolic control twice-daily insulin Detemir injection child adolescence type 1 diabetes mellitus . All eligible patient assign receive insulin Detemir daily breakfast . Short act insulin analog , Novorapid , use mealtime insulin . The start dose insulin Detemir individually determined.Based self-measured fasting blood glucose level , insulin dos titrate throughout trial , aim pre-breakfast premeal concentration 90-180 mg/dl subject age 6-12 year 80-130 mg/dl subject age 13-18 years.Patients 4 week titration phase achieve target blood glucose titration insulin Detemir do , due hypoglycemic episode would switch treatment consist twice daily insulin Detemir . If target blood glucose achieve end 4 week titration phase , titration possible patient suffer hypoglycemic episode , titration period would extend patient would switch treatment 2 injection insulin Detemir.When achieve blood glucose target patient continue study end maintenance phase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An open label , treat target , prospective , intervention study order compare metabolic control twice-daily insulin detemir injection child adolescence type 1 diabetes mellitus . Study objectives : 1 . To assess efficacy safety insulin detemir therapy ( twice daily ) use treat target titration protocol initiate maintain therapy child adolescent type 1 diabetes . 2 . To evaluate percentage patient That achieve reduction 0.5 % HbA1c baseline end study evaluation . 3 . To evaluate Incidence sever , nocturnal , symptomatic asymptomatic hypoglycemia glucose excursion hyper hypoglycemia measure area curve determine CGMS technique . Treatment plan : Patients assign receive insulin detemir daily breakfast . Short act insulin analog , Novorapid , use mealtime insulin . The start dose insulin detemir individually determine . Based self-measured fasting blood glucose level , insulin dos titrate throughout trial , aim pre breakfast premeal concentration 90-180 mg/dl subject age 6-12 year 80-130 mg/dl subject age 13-18 year . Patients 4 week titration phase achieve target blood glucose titration insulin Detemir do , due hypoglycemic episode , would switch treatment consist twice daily insulin Detemir . If target blood glucose achieve end 4 week titration phase , titration possible patient suffer hypoglycemic episode , titration period would extend patient would switch treatment 2 injection insulin Detemir .</detailed_description>
