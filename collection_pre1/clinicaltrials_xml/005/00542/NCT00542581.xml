	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate visual outcome patient satisfaction implantation toric IOL patient predict residual corneal astigmatism 0.75 1.00 D. Cataract prevalent throughout world IOLs routinely implant extraction cataractous lens . It frequently perform surgery United States estimate 2-3 million procedure perform annually . With age population rise , well increase popularity refractive intraocular lens , number intraocular surgery continue rise . Over year , surgical technique evolve intracapsular extraction modern phacoemulsification . This development help evolution IOLs well . The IOLs advance extensively : different material design available , permit implantation small , sutureless incision . Traditional IOLs monofocal design provide vision one distance , typically far ; correct mainly spherical component refractive error . However , patient corneal astigmatism require additional surgical treatment laser correction ( laser situ leratomileusis , LASIK ; photorefractive keratectomy , PRK ) limbal relax incision , RLI ) . Another alternative use toric IOL , especially design correct sphere astigmatism . The ACRYSOF Toric IOL intend primary implantation capsular bag eye visual correction aphakia preexist comeal astigmatism adult patient without presbyopia , desire improve uncorrected distance vision , reduction residual refractive cylinder increase spectacle independence distance vision . The treatment selection corneal astigmatism depend amount cylinder follow , 0.25 0.75 D create surgical incision steep axis ; 0.75 1.75 D , RLI ; 1 2.25 D , toric IOLs ; 1 3.00 D , LASIK/PRK .</brief_summary>

SUBJECTS A total 40 eye ( 20 per site ) 20 subject sexes race undergo routine phacoemulsification intraocular lens implantation include . 2.1 . Patient Inclusion Criteria : Subjects MUST fulfill follow condition qualify enrollment trial 2.1.1 . Subject must age-related cataract eye . 2.1.2 . 21 year age old . 2.1.3 . Patient must desire cataract extraction . 2.1.4 . Expected maximum 2 week minimum 1-week interval first second eye surgery . 2.1.5 . Cross-cylinder value calculation Toric Calculator indicate cross-cylinder correction 0.75D 1.0D least one eye 1.75 fellow eye . 2.1.6 . Willing able comply schedule visit study procedure . 2.2 . Patient Exclusion Criteria : Subjects ANY follow condition eligibility exam may NOT enrolled trial . 2.2.1 . Preoperative ocular pathology : amblyopia , rubella cataract , proliferative diabetic retinopathy , shallow anterior chamber , macular edema , retinal detachment , aniridia iris atrophy , uveitis , history iritis , iris neovascularization , medically uncontrolled glaucoma , microphthalmus macrophthalmus , optic nerve atrophy , macular degeneration ( anticipated best postoperative visual acuity le 20/30 ) , advance glaucomatous damage , etc . 2.2.2 .

Participation ( current participation ) investigational drug device trial within previous 30 day prior start date trial . 2.2.10 . Intraocular conventional surgery within past three month intraocular laser surgery within one month operate eye . 2.2.11 . Other ocular surgery time cataract extraction . The principal investigator reserve right declare patient ineligible non-evaluable base medical evidence indicate patient unsuitable trial . 2.3 . Surgical Exclusion Criteria The study lens implanted patient exclude study follow complication encounter surgery : 2.3.1 . Significant anterior chamber bleeding . 2.3.2 . Detached Descemet 's membrane 2.3.3 . Iris damage 2.3.4 . Inability achieve secure , symmetric , `` bag '' position IOL : posterior capsule rupture , radial tear capsulorhexis , vitreous loss , zonular rupture . 2.3.5 . Use corneal suture 1 week . 2.4 . Post-implantation Exclusion Criteria 2.4.1 . Haptic capsular bag . 2.4.2 . Decentration IOL 1.0 mm 2.4.3 . Ocular pathology potentially affect visual acuity evident prior surgery . The principal investigator reserve right declare patient ineligible nonevaluable base medical evidence indicate patient unsuitable trial . 3 . STUDY ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES Subjects recruit corneal anterior segment clinic Storm Eye Institute satellite office . Once identify study candidate , patient ask he/she would like participate . A study coordinator one investigator answer question obtain informed consent . The patient understand participation study affect quality care . 4 . STUDY INTERVENTION The Acrysof toric SN60T3 IOL approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . The examination treatment use protocol similar use routine practice . Therefore , additional risk involve study extremely low . Patients undergo routine cataract extraction intraocular implantation Acrysof toric lens eye . 5 . STUDY VISIT SCHEDULE AND ASSESSMENTS ( Table 1 ) 5.1 . Visit Schedule Patients examine follow interval : 1 . Visit 1 : Preoperative evaluation complete four week surgery 2 . Visit 2 : Date Surgery 3 . Visit 3 : 14 ± 2 day postoperative 4 . Visit 4 : 30 ±5 day postoperative 5 . Visit 5 : 90 ±7 day postoperative 6 . Visit 6 : 180 ±10 day postoperative Additional office visit require medical safety . On visit unscheduled patient visit case report complete . 6 . MEASUREMENTS AND EVALUATIONS 6.1 . Visit 1 : Preoperative assessment include thorough medical history complete eye examination . The latter include ETDRS uncorrected distance visual acuity ( UCDVA ) , manifest refraction , ETDRS best correct distance visual acuity ( BCDVA ) , slit-lamp exam , manual keratometry , Orbscan , quality vision questionnaire evaluate well . Informed consent obtain prior perform procedure study . Patient must review sign documentation . Women childbearing potential undergo pregnancy test enter trial negative . 6.2 . Visit 2 : Surgery perform surgeon topical anesthesia . A standard phacoemulsification posterior chamber lens insertion perform accord investigator 's preferred technique . If major complication occur surgery ( e.g . expulsive hemorrhage vitreous loss require vitrectomy ) , patient exclude trial . Subjects implant Acrysof Toric SN60T3 IOL . Postoperatively , patient instruct follow standard care routinely use cataract extraction . 6.3 .

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 7.1 . Sample size calculation : This pilot study . 7.2 . Statistical Method : All data collect study coordinator . Data enter Access database . The database password protect access restrict study personnel . Data analysis perform without patient identification . Comparisons statistical analysis do determine statistical difference exist preoperative postoperative visit . Statistical analysis do use standard descriptive statistic test deem appropriate base distribution data . If data normally distribute , test t-test use , non-normally distribute data analyze use Wilcoxon test comparison group . ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test use comparison baseline postoperative visit . A P le 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
