	<brief_summary>This study collect representative blood sample healthy child adult child adult unique red blood cell feature relate sickle cell disease . Sickle cell disease blood disease limit ability red blood cell carry oxygen throughout body . The purpose study collect variety blood sample may use investigate advance potential new drug treatment sickle cell disease . Volunteers must least 8 year old . Samples take healthy volunteer volunteer unique red blood cell feature relate sickle cell disease . Candidates screen medical history . During study , participant undergo one- two-hour outpatient procedure National Institutes Health Clinical Center . Once researcher explain study obtain participant consent , participant donate 8 cc ( approximately 2 teaspoon ) blood . Because repeat test help researcher validate study finding , participant unique red blood cell feature mention may also ask willing return donate another 2 cc 8 cc blood additional study . The amount blood drawn exceed 50 ml eight-week period adult 7 cc within six-week period child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The critical event lead serious morbidity sickle cell disease distortion ( sickling ) consequent stiffen red blood cell cause abnormal hemoglobin . Currently , hydroxyurea approve drug treat sickle cell disease , partially effective . This protocol seek identify high sensitivity vitro screen method additional compound result inhibit sickling red blood cell . Subjects sickle cell trait disease normal volunteer ask donate blood sample study verify hemoglobinopathy periodically donate small volume sample fresh blood use ongoing high throughput screen test identify potentially clinically useful anti-sickling drug .</detailed_description>
