	<brief_summary>A primary goal clinical research study find high safe dose sorafenib give combination idarubicin Ara-C treatment acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) high-risk , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . Once high safe dose find , researcher try learn combination treatment help control AML high-risk MDS newly diagnose patient . The safety treatment combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I-II Study Idarubicin , Cytarabine , Sorafenib ( BAY43-9006 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Sorafenib design block function important protein cancer cell . When active , proteins help cause abnormal growth behavior leukemia cell . Idarubicin Ara-C design insert DNA ( genetic material cell ) stop DNA repairing . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . If enrolled Phase I part study , dose sorafenib receive Ara-C idarubicin depend enrol study . Each new group 3 participant receive high dose level sorafenib previous group high safe dose sorafenib give combination Ara-C idarubicin reach . If enrol Phase II portion study , receive high safe dose sorafenib combination Ara-C idarubicin find Phase I part . Study Drug Administration : During study , receive treatment 28-day `` cycle . '' The dos idarubicin Ara-C study participant . On Days 1-4 ( Days 1-3 old 60 ) induction cycle ( # 1 possibly # 2 ) , receive Ara-C nonstop infusion ( needle vein ) . You also receive steroid mouth vein every day reduce risk side effect , rash . On Days 1-3 induction cycle ( # 1 possibly # 2 ) , receive idarubicin vein 1 hour day . In general , sorafenib take mouth twice daily Days 1-7 , unless otherwise instruct . However , dose sorafenib may differ among study participant . Sorafenib take water empty stomach . Your study doctor give complete instruction take sorafenib . Depending side effect may , dose sorafenib may decrease , stop side effect go away , even stop completely , doctor think best interest . Study Visits : During Cycles 1-2 , study visit 2 time week . You may need study visit often study doctor think necessary . At visit , follow procedure perform . - You ask side effect may experience medication may take . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . During Cycles 1 2 , Days 21-28 , bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy perform check status disease . For Cycle 3 cycle , bone marrow aspirate determine necessary doctor . If doctor think respond treatment , bone marrow aspirate collect every 3-6 month , doctor feel necessary . Consolidation Therapy : If find disease respond treatment , may receive 5 additional cycle therapy . These cycle call `` consolidation '' therapy give every 4-6 week . On Days 1-3 , Ara-C give nonstop infusion . You also receive steroid either mouth vein help reduce risk side effect . On Days 1-2 , idarubicin give vein 1 hour . Sorafenib take twice daily mouth 7 day , schedule determine study doctor . After cycle , every 4-6 week , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check blood count level . Maintenance Therapy : After 5 cycle consolidation therapy , accord response consolidation therapy , may continue study receive `` maintenance '' treatment , need , determine study doctor 7 cycle . You take sorafenib twice day every day 28-day cycle . Every 1-4 week , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Length Study : You may receive 14 cycle total therapy . You may take study leukemia get bad , develop another illness interfere take study drug , intolerable side effect . This investigational study . Sorafenib FDA approve commercially available treatment metastatic renal cancer . Idarubicin FDA approve use combination approve antileukemic drug treatment acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) adult . Cytarabine FDA approve use treatment leukemia . The use sorafenib combine idarubicin Ara-C treatment AML high-risk MDS investigational authorize use research . Up 75 patient take part study . All patient enrol M. D. Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
