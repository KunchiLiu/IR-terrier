	<brief_title>An Open-Label Trial N-Acetylcysteine Cannabis Dependent Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project involve investigation oral N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) potential pharmacologic agent treatment cannabis dependence adolescent . Cannabis dependence continue major problem among adolescent United States . To date , psychosocial intervention produce small modest effect size control trial , minimal work do investigate potential role pharmacotherapy cannabis dependence . Translating preclinical research suggest role NAC cocaine dependent individual , research group develop preliminary evidence decrease cocaine use cue reactivity human take NAC . Preclinical research additionally demonstrate significant parallel glutamatergic dysfunction nucleus accumbens ( propose target NAC treatment ) habitual cocaine marijuana user . NAC inexpensive , long-available agent favorable tolerability profile adult child . However , yet study cannabis dependent adolescent . Hence , undertake open-label pilot trial NAC adolescent cannabis dependence . The primary specific aim propose project : 1 . To assess feasibility conduct trial NAC cannabis dependent adolescent . 2 . To assess safety tolerability NAC cannabis dependent adolescents The secondary specific aim propose project : 3 . To gather variability information assist design larger-scale , adequately power clinical trial NAC cannabis dependent adolescent . Primary hypothesis 1 . It feasible recruit retain cannabis dependent adolescent trial NAC . 2 . NAC well tolerate among cannabis dependent adolescent . Secondary hypothesis 3 . Adequate variability information gather design larger-scale , adequately power clinical trial NAC cannabis dependent adolescent . Twenty-four adolescent 12 20 year old recruit study . Results project use design study .</detailed_description>
