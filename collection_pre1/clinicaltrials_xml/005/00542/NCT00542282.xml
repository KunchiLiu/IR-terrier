	<brief_summary>Obstructive lung disease usually differential diagnostic consideration patient present breathlessness cough . Spirometry key diagnostic test use confirm airflow obstruction particularly primary care set . Airflow obstruction completely resolve administration bronchodilator , definition , exclude diagnosis COPD . Evaluation obstructive lung disease must include pulmonary function test ; bronchoreversibility test adjunct differentiate asthma COPD . Bronchoreversibility serve absolute diagnostic criterion separate asthma COPD . Vibration response imaging ( VRI ) technology provide simple , radiation-free method image lung , visualize vibration energy ( lung sound ) emit respiration cycle . In study , regional quantitative qualitative information vibration response compare spirometry assess lung function COPD Asthma patient .</brief_summary>
