	<detailed_description>CAH genetic steroidogenesis disorder . The common form , 21OHD , lead cortisol deficiency , turn , excess androgen , hormone promotes development maintenance male sex characteristic . As result androgen excess , prepubescent male newborn , prepubescent , grown female exhibit mature masculine characteristic . The symptom severity 21OHD vary among individual disease adult versus child . The reason difference yet know . Current therapy 21OHD consist administration glucocorticoid replace cortisol suppress excessive pituitary function . With information gene factor contribute severity 21OHD , researcher may able good treat child adults disease . This study examine participant ' DNA determine gene may affect severity 21OHD may make disease milder adult child . People interested participate 3-day inpatient study first undergo physical exam provide blood sample determine eligibility . Eligible participant admit study site morning first study day . A blood sample take participant receive one 10-mg pill hydrocortisone . Heart rate blood pressure take every 4 hour throughout day . In morning Day 2 , blood sample take participant ask urinate toilet . After point end study , participant collect urine jug . On morning Day 3 , participant complete urine collection blood sample take . Participants receive intravenously medicine call cosyntropin , synthetic form hormone body make . About 1 hour , participant provide final blood sample . Participants receive one last pill hydrocortisone prior end study .</detailed_description>
