	<brief_summary>Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ALI/ARDS ) severe lung condition cause respiratory failure . Individuals ALI/ARDS often require use respirator artificial breathing machine , know mechanical ventilator , intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Research show lung protective ventilation ( LPV ) , type mechanical ventilation technique , effective way reduce number death due ALI/ARDS . This study evaluate effectiveness Web-based educational program aim educate ICU clinician use LPV patient ALI/ARDS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Web-Based Ventilator Management Educational Program Clinicians ( The Lung Injury Knowledge Network LINK Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ALI/ARDS life-threatening condition involve inflammation lung fluid accumulation air sac , lead low blood oxygen level respiratory failure . Common cause include pneumonia , septic shock , lung trauma , patient require immediate care ICU . The main form treatment ALI/ARDS delivery oxygen continuous level pressure damage lung mechanical ventilation . Each year , 74,500 people die due ALI/ARDS 22 % death could prevent use LPV . LPV mechanical ventilation technique lower volume oxygen administer . The purpose study implement evaluate Web-based educational program provide educational instructional resource ALI/ARDS LPV ICU clinician , include physician , nurse , respiratory therapist . Hospitals participate study randomly assign access Web site either begin study period later time . Participating clinician hospital access Web site often necessary 6-month period . The Web site contain background educational information ALI/ARDS LPV , include recognize ALI/ARDS implement LPV patient . Scholarly article material , include chart help clinician determine appropriate ventilator setting patient , available download . Clinicians also able email question critical care expert . At end 6-month study period , study staff compare number patient receive LPV number patient receive LPV prior start study .</detailed_description>
