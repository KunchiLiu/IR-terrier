	<brief_title>PCMRI - MRI/TRUS System Evaluation Prostate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer ( PC ) common male malignancy western world . In U.S. approximately 230,000 new diagnosis annually . Each year , 40,000 men establish disease die PC . Early detection possible use prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) and/or DRE , follow biopsy PC suspect . Biopsy generally carry transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) guidance rectum wall . Typically , 6-13 sample different area prostate take order cover entire gland area . Since TRUS accurately detect PC , prostate biopsy , date , fact random biopsy . Furthermore , PSA may elevate , patient without PC , lead many 75 % patient undergoing unnecessary TRUS guide biopsy [ 1,2 ] . The need accurate preoperative evaluation PC , well early detection tumor lead numerous application Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) prostate.1 The sensitivity specificity whole body MRI pelvic phased-array coil low ~70 % . Improved sensitivity obtain use endorectal coil efficacy ~85 % report due improve signal noise ratio ( SNR ) coils.2 One major limitation conventional MRI scanner cost limited availability . A portable , hand-held MR scanner capable detect PC thus , interest . TopSpin develop novel MRI base system prostate imaging Urology . The primary use prostate MRI probe diagnosis , stag guidance minimally invasive therapy PC . The system consist miniaturize transrectal MRI probe , incorporate magnetic field source coil . The MRI probe integrate used conjunction TRUS system . The TRUS probe provide prostate gross anatomy allow Urologist select cross-section ( ) interest within prostate . The MRI probe provide MRI image select cross-section ( ) improve tissue characterization enable localizing tumor within prostate . Fusion image promise significantly improve ability direct biopsy region much high likelihood malignant . In addition , system capable guide local treatment Cryotherapy Brachytherapy . The integrate MRI-TRUS system resemble state-of-the-art , high-end ultrasound system . The MR-TRUS probe connect cart base console , house electronics hardware require MR ultrasound activation . An investigational device manufacture , handle , store accordance applicable good manufacturing practice ( GMP ) . It use accordance approve protocol . Procedures assure quality every aspect trial implement .</detailed_description>
