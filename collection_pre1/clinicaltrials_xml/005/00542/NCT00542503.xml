	<brief_title>Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predict People Who Are Likely Develop Flash Pulmonary Edema ( The PREDICT Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary edema condition abnormal build-up fluid occur lung , lead swell . Symptoms include shortness breath , breathe difficulty , cough . Flash pulmonary edema , develop suddenly life-threatening , usually cause heart failure . It occur leave ventricle heart weaken function properly , potentially impede flow blood heart rest body . Blood pressure fluid volume increase , excess blood accumulates blood vessel tissue lung . Flash pulmonary edema require immediate treatment , include supplemental oxygen , mechanical ventilation , medication . This study determine new form MRI test use identify probable abnormality blood flow lung predict increase risk develop flash pulmonary edema among old adult . This study enroll people risk develop flash pulmonary edema . At baseline study visit , participant undergo medical record review , physical exam , blood collection , question cardiovascular health , MRI stress test . For stress test , participant first receive medication dobutamine , increase heart rate reduce blood supply heart . Participants place MRI machine image heart take . All participant complete follow-up cardiovascular health questionnaire three time year 1 10 year , depend participant enrol study .</detailed_description>
