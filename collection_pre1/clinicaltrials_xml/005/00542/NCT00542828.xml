	<criteria>Patient provide sign write informed consent . Patient pathologically confirm low intermediate1 risk MDS time MDS diagnosis time screen . Patient receive 1 prior treatment MDS . Patient exhibit least 1 hematologic cytopenia ( anemia , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia ) period ≥1 week . Patient documentation prior transfusion requirement . Patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance score 0 , 1 , 2 . Patient ≥18 ≤70 year age time sign informed consent document ( ICD ) . Patient able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . Patient willing practice medically approve method birth control participation study ( least 12 month last infusion rATG ) ( fertile male female patient ) . Patient pregnant lactating . Patient prior treatment ATG . Patient receive immunomodulatory immunosuppressing agent ( exclude steroid ) &lt; 12 week prior first infusion rATG . Patient prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and/or organ transplant . Patient prior allergic reaction rabbit proteins excipients . Patient follow subtypes MDS : refractory anemia ring sideroblast ( RARS ) ; chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) white blood count &gt; 13x10^9/L ; MDS/myeloproliferative disease ( MPD ) . Patient MDS associate 5q chromosomal deletion unless patient receive prior lenalidomide treatment &lt; 4 week prior first infusion rATG . Patient MDS presume secondary exposure chemical treatment radiotherapy chemotherapy . Patient receive investigational agent within 4 week prior first infusion rATG . Patient follow abnormality : serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &gt; 2.5 x ULN ; serum total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN , except unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia relate patient 's MDS . Patient receive treatment nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) within 14 day prior start treatment . Patient known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive . Patient prior diagnosis malignancy MDS , unless patient diseasefree least 5 year follow completion curative intent therapy . Patient serious medical condition ( MDS ) would limit survival &lt; 2 year . Patient active acute chronic infection , include cytomegaloviremia ( CMV ) infection deep tissue infection . Patient serious medical condition , uncontrolled illness ( include , limited , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia ) , social condition , psychiatric illness would prevent patient signing informed consent document ( ICD ) , would place patient unacceptable risk he/she participate study , would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
