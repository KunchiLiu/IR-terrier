	<brief_summary>Aging associate loss lean muscle mass , term sarcopenia . Food intake particular ingestion protein amino acid show powerful stimulus promote net muscle protein anabolism . However anabolic response follow meal-like protein bolus seem blunt elderly compare young adult . The first aim proposal investigate post-prandial muscle protein synthesis rate young elderly men response meal-like protein bolus period rest physical activity ( study A ) . The rest trial ( REST ) act proof-of-principle study examine blunt protein synthetic response elderly , control trial comparison exercise trial ( EXC ) establish surplus value physical activity prior protein intake muscle protein synthesis . The second aim proposal determine surplus value increase quantity ingest protein bolus ( study B ) . Large amount protein ( 40 60 g ) compare meal-like amount protein ( 20 g ) mean maximize plasma amino acid availability and/or stimulate muscle protein anabolism . The third aim proposal study difference quality ingest protein bolus ( study C ) . Instead significantly increase quantity protein bolus , also apply practical approach augment skeletal muscle protein synthesis rate ; modify digestibility amino acid composition meal-like protein bolus .</brief_summary>
