	<detailed_description>One frustrating problem IVF today poor ovarian response . There amount woman undergo infertility treatment , respond poorly usual gonatotrophin stimulation protocol apply . The ovarian response , number antral follicle oocytes developed ovary stimulation , correlate directly ovarian reserve . As ovarian reserve define existent quantitative qualitative supply follicle find ovary potentially develop dominant therefore closely associated reproductive potential . There plethora criterion use characterize poor response . The number develop follicle number oocytes retrieved standard dose ovarian stimulation protocol , two substantial criterion definition poor ovarian reserve . Satisfying response ovulation induction consider retrieval 5-14 oocyte per patient , whereas poor response consider retrieval 4 less oocyte . Using standard dos , however , number patient exhibit inappropriate ovarian response . Exaggerated response lead increase risk ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome , hand , inadequate ovarian response associate increase number IVF cancellation . During past two decade , substantial amount research carry order improve knowledge ovarian response predictor . Age often guide infertility treatment choice , since woman 's chronological age single important factor predict couple 's reproductive potential , generally acknowledge reproductive ageing related quantitative qualitative reduction primordial follicle pool . However , age alone limit value predict response infertility treatment . A number ovarian reserve test design order determine ovarian reserve evaluate ability predict outcome IVF . Many test become part routine diagnostic procedure infertile patient undergo assist reproductive technique . These ovarian reserve test include measurement specific endocrine marker combination study ultra-sonographic parameter . Basal FSH first widely use endocrine marker ovarian reserve well potential age predict decreased ovarian function today establish patient elevate basal FSH level lower success rate IVF . At present , several marker ovarian reserve advocate , basal estradiol level , basal LH level , early follicular phase serum inhibin B concentration anti-mullerian hormone concentration . Moreover , several ovarian ultrasonographic parameter study marker ovarian resposiveness . The antral follicle count , ovarian volume ovarian stromal blood flow appear indicative poor response assist reproduction . The purpose prospective study evaluate association endocrine ultrasonographic marker ovarian reserve IVF outcome determine marker contribute prediction poor response IVF .</detailed_description>
