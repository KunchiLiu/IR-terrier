Patients previously participate NIH study follow possible long-term benefit side effect treatment . Patients treat alpha-interferon interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) may continue treatment medication felt might benefit . Blood sample may draw part standard medical care research purpose . Other test may do appropriate diagnosis treatment , include , example , chest X-ray , electrocardiogram , tissue biopsy . Patients see follow-up visit regular interval monitor treatment progress . Certain patient currently enrol NIH study IL-2 treatment may participate phase study add corticosteroid , hydrocortisone , prednisone , prednisonolone , regimen . Patients whose CD4 count increase IL-2 receive corticosteroid ( mouth vein ) open manner . Patients respond IL-2 therapy randomly assign receive corticosteroid placebo ( inactive substance ) IL-2 infusion blind manner , neither patient medical staff know patient receive drug receive placebo . Participants request receive least three round treatment corticosteroid placebo . Patients currently take IL-2 subcutaneous injection ( skin ) may participate optional part study receive future IL-2 cycle home instead near Clinical Center . Patients show ability self-administer tolerate IL-2 injection minimal supervision minimal side effect may eligible option . Home administration IL-2 involve less frequent data safety monitoring , on-site medical evaluation begin cycle . Participants continue see Clinical Center regularly schedule follow-up visit medical evaluation start IL-2 cycle determine safe begin cycle . Patients case manager place monitor call day 2 4 cycle third follow-up call 1 week later . Patients responsible contact study staff member complication problem develop time .</brief_summary>
