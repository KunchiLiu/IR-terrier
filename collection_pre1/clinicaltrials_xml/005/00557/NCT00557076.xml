	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether familiar vocal stimulation , provide coma recovery , improve outcome person unconscious severe TBI . The primary hypothesis unconscious person receive standard rehabilitation ( SR ) plus high-dose Familiar Voice stimulation ( FVs ) compare unconscious person receive SR plus sham stimulation ( Sham Group ) demonstrate : 1 . Significantly neurobehavioral function post-intervention compare pre-intervention . 2 . Using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) , significantly high average measure volumetric activity whole brain , middle temporal gyrus bilaterally , primary auditory area , bilateral pre-frontal cortex , hippocampus and/or cerebellum post-intervention compare pre-intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Medical advance improve odds survive severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) thereby increase demand rehabilitation . Medical rehabilitation management coma recovery , however , hamper paucity rigorous clinical trial examine rehabilitation effectiveness . This randomized clinical trial address knowledge gap . The purpose study determine whether high dose familiar vocal stimulation ( FVs ) improve outcomes person unconscious severe TBI . The research objectives : 1 . Determine whether neural response elicit FVs improve neurobehavioral outcome and/or elicit activation expect region . 2 . Examine relationship neurobehavioral neurophysiological response high dos FVs coma recovery . There two study cohort group receive standard rehabilitation . The experimental group expose daily 40 minute FVs 6 week . The Sham Group ( Control Group 2 ) receive 40 minute sham treatment , silence , daily 6 week . The 40 minute FVs treatment provide four 10 minute session . Each FV session start subject hearing familiar voice call 'Subject 's Own Name ' aloud voice re-telling memory event familiar subject . The person re-telling event person experience event subject interact subject daily basis least 1 year prior injury .</detailed_description>
