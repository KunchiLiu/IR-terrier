	<brief_summary>Two group patient prostate cancer enrol : Group A : patient whose cancer worsen spread hormonal therapy chemotherapy . Group B : patient rise PSA surgery radiotherapy prostate spread bone organ . Patients receive Phenoxodiol ( PXD ) 400 mg every 8 hour daily 28 consecutive day ( 1 cycle ) . Treatment outcome evaluate three cycle ( 12 week ) PXD treatment ( immediately prior cycle 4 ) . Patients progression disease take study . Responding stable disease patient remain study total 12 cycle ( approximately 12 month ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All patient must histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate Patients castrate noncastrate level testosterone eligible define . Patients castrate level testosterone ( Group A androgen independent disease ) need meet follow criterion : Progressive disease base one follow ) rise PSA , b ) transaxial imaging , c ) radionuclide bone scan . Patients whose sole manifestation progression increase disease relate symptom eligible . 1 . PSA minimum 3 consecutive rising level , interval &gt; 1 week determination . The last determination must minimal value &gt; 4 ng/ml determine within two week prior registration . 2 . Measurable Disease : Patient show new progressive soft tissue mass CT MRI scan eligible . 3 . Radionuclide bone scan : New metastatic lesion . Serum testosterone &lt; 50 ng/ml , determine within two week prior start treatment Maintaining castrate status : Patients undergone surgical orchiectomy continue medical therapy [ i.e . gonadotropin release hormone analog ( GnRH analogs ) maintain castrate level serum testosterone . Patients receive antiandrogen part firstline hormonal therapy must show progression disease antiandrogen prior enrollment . Patients must discontinue Megestrol Acetate ( MEGACE ) show progression disease medication . No prior chemotherapy except adjuvant neoadjuvant therapy give &gt; 3 year prior enrollment No one prior course palliative radiotherapy . No prior radioisotope therapy Strontium89 Samarium . Patients noncastrate level testosterone ( Group B androgen dependent disease ) need meet follow criterion : A rise PSA radical prostatectomy , radiotherapy radiation implant evidence metastatic disease bone , CT scan MRI scan . PSA double time le 12 month Testosterone level &gt; 50 ng/ml Age &gt; 18 year age . Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; 70 % Four week since major surgery . Patients must sign informed consent document state understand investigational nature propose treatment . Required Initial Laboratory Data : WBC &gt; 3,000/µl ANC &gt; 1,500/µl Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dl Platelet count &gt; 100,000/µl Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal Bilirubin within 2 x normal limit SGOT ( AST ) &lt; 2.5 x upper limit normal SGPT ( AST ) &lt; 2.5 x upper limit normal PSA &gt; 4.0 ng/ml ( measurable disease Group B ) &gt; 4.0 ng/ml Group A PT within normal limit ( * ) PTT within normal limit ( * ) ( * ) unless patient already anticoagulated reason ( i.e . atrial fibrillation , etc . ) Agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation additional 1 month finish Phenoxodiol . Able swallow retain oral medication Life expectancy &gt; 3 month Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients may continue daily MultiVitamin Calcium supplement herbal , alternative food supplement ( i.e . PCSpes , Saw Palmetto , St John Wort , etc . ) must discontinue registration . Bisphosphonate therapy bone metastases allow ; however , treatment must initiate prior first dose PXD . Prophylactic use bisphosphonates patient without bone disease , except treatment osteoporosis , initiation bisphosphonates study treatment permit . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients significant cardiovascular disease include congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Class III IV ) , active angina pectoris recent myocardial infarction ( within last 6 month ) exclude . Patients prior history hemorrhagic thrombotic cerebral vascular accident , deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism within past 6 month exclude . Patients `` currently active '' second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer register . Patients consider `` currently active '' malignancy complete therapy consider ( physician ) less 30 % risk relapse . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Because patient immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction Phenoxodiol . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
