	<brief_summary>A common soft tissue injury sport involve sprint jump hamstring strain . Not much evidence-based research carry prevention hamstring strain . Most study suggest hamstring strain occur later part swing phase player sprint . In phase hamstring muscle work decelerate knee extension - , muscle develops tension lengthen . This mean muscle change function eccentrically concentrically . We hypothesize rapid change eccentric concentric function muscle vulnerable injury , injury prevent increase eccentric muscle strength hamstring . This randomized clinical trial examine effect 10-week preseason strength-training program Danish elite soccer . The strength-training program focus eccentric hamstring training . 60 elite team ( 1200 soccer player ) cluster-randomized either ordinary training ordinary training combine eccentric hamstring strength training . The training group start train program pre-season ( 10 week ) continue train week follow season . Suspected hamstring strain season examine within 3 day use ultrasound . Ultrasound verify hamstring strain register , player start standardized rehabilitation program .</brief_summary>
