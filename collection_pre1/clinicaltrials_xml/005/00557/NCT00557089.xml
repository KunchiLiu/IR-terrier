	<brief_title>The Effect rhDNase Ventilation Inhomogeneity Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Life expectancy CF patient greatly increase due improve clinical care . While certainly beneficial CF patient , make difficult assess effect therapeutic intervention . Currently , FEV1 remain primary outcome parameter clinical trial , many CF patient normal pulmonary function annual rate decline le 2 % . Therefore , additional parameter need sensitive define abnormality CF patient use therapeutic trial . Gas mix technique show sensitive parameter define abnormality patient cystic fibrosis , unclear useful technique detect change therapeutic intervention . Abnormalities gas clearance lung largely due retention inhaled gas due mucous obstruction lower airway assess lung clearance index ( LCI ) . Interventions improve mucous accumulation expect improve lung clearance assess technique . RhDNase demonstrate improve lung function reduce pulmonary exacerbation patient cystic fibrosis due improve mucus clearance . Lung clearance index ( LCI ) show sensitive spirometry detect abnormality CF patient . Clear cut-offs find differentiate normal patient even newly diagnose CF patient . However , little know LCI may change treatment .</detailed_description>
