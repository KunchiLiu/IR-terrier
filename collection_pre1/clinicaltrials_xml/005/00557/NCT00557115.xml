	<brief_title>Early Pulmonary Rehabilitation Following Acute COPD Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , also sometimes know chronic asthma , bronchitis emphysema , important health problem . Many people COPD admit hospital worsening symptom , know exacerbation . Hospitalisations acute exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) massive burden NHS . Over past decade , hospitalization increase 50 % , annual hospital cost COPD UK amount £587 million . After discharge , people fail cope well due variety reason . A prolonged stay hospital may lead muscle weakness , particularly leg muscle [ 1 ] , loss confidence perform everyday activity , increase anxiety [ 2 ] . A high proportion patient re−admitted hospital follow discharge . The aim study ass whether attendance exercise training education programme shortly follow discharge firstly , improve exercise capacity quality life , secondly , reduce use health resource cost NHS . It known exercise training education programme know Pulmonary Rehabilitation beneficial stable patient COPD reduce breathlessness , increase exercise capacity improve quality life . We recently perform pilot study show early Pulmonary Rehabilitation considerable short−term benefit patient COPD recently discharge follow hospital admission worsen symptom [ 3 ] . We hypothesise benefit long−lasting , may reduce use healthcare resource cost NHS . References : 1 .

Description Study : Based result pilot study [ 1 ] , hypothesise early pulmonary rehabilitation ( EPR ) lead long term improvement exercise capacity , quality life , use &amp; result cost healthcare resource , peripheral muscle strength daily activity level . The null hypothesis EPR lead significant difference outcome compare usual care ( UC ) . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS : This prospective randomise control clinical trial EPR vs. usual care.By use control group , statistically significant difference outcome attribute EPR . No treatment consider part routine care withhold UC group . Patients : Patients study acute exacerbation COPD deem sufficiently unwell duty medical registrar warrant hospital admission . Exclusion criterion include significant co−morbidity could limit exercise training , attendance pulmonary rehabilitation programme precede year . In−patient treatment include standard therapy ( nebulised bronchodilator , oxygen , non−invasive ventilation ( require ) , antibiotic 1−2 week course oral prednisolone 30−40mg daily ) . On hospital discharge , patient allocate either early pulmonary rehabilitation ( EPR ) group ( within 7 day hospital discharge ) usual care ( UC ) i.e . routine outpatient primary−care follow−up . PROTOCOL : In 48 hour plan hospital discharge , follow measurement make patient : 1 . Pulmonary function test , include ear−lobe blood gas , spirometry , lung volume , transfer factor . 2 . Anthropometric data , include height , weight , body mass index , lean body mass ( measured bio−electrical impedance ) 3 . Field exercise capacity measure incremental shuttle walk , standard externally pace , incremental , maximal , corridor−walking test [ 2 ] . 4 . Disease−specific generic health status , measure Chronic Respiratory Diseases Questionnaire ( CRDQ ) [ 3 ] , St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) [ 4 ] . Interviews take place lung function department King 's College Hospital . 5 . Cardiopulmonary exercise test subset voulnteers , measurement VO2 , VCO2 lactic acid . 6 . Non−volitional volitional quadriceps strength : twitch quadriceps tension follow supramaximal stimulation femoral nerve maximum isometric voluntary contraction . This painless supramaximal method assess quadriceps strength fatigue [ 5 ] [ 6 ] . 7 . Endurance walk capacity ( endurance shuttle walk ) 8 . Health resource usage ( see later ) . The EuroQol ( EQ−5D ) instrument [ 7 ] use main measure health−related quality−of−life economic evaluation . The measurement make baseline repeat 3 12 month . Of note , study prospective longitudinal study , patient familiarise exercise test day discharge minimise learning effect . Verbal encouragement exercise test standardise avoid researcher effect . The assessor blind subject 's intervention . However owing nature intervention , possible blind subject intervention . RANDOMISATION : At discharge , patient allocate either hospital outpatient exercise rehabilitation programme , usual care . Due number study , allocation treatment use minimisation method use ensure comparable group . The following factor take account : 1 . Age ( 70 ) 2 . Gender ( male/female ) 3 . Hospital Discharge incremental shuttle walk distance ( le 100 metre ) . 4 . Length Hospital Admission ( less 7 day ) 5 . FEV1 le 30 % predict INTERVENTION : Patients allocate EPR group attend pulmonary rehabilitation programme within 7 day hospital discharge . This consist two session week 8 week , supervise multi−disciplinary team consist physiotherapist , occupational therapist , nurse dieticians well clinical research fellow fund propose grant . Each session consist 60 minute exercise , make aerobic walk cycling exercise plus low upper limb strength endurance exercise , 1 hour discussion focus psychosocial lifestyle issue , particular emphasis nutrition domestic activity . The EPR group also give individualise home exercise programme , encourage daily exercise . The UC group receive usual outpatient primary care follow−up . HEALTH ECONOMICS : The EuroQol ( EQ−5D ) instrument use main measure health−related quality−of−life economic evaluation [ 9 ] . It develop collaborative group European researcher preference−based index , suitable calculation QALYs . The EQ−5D one two instrument currently recommend use economic evaluation [ 8 ] . Information patient ' use health service collect review hospital note , patient recall home diary issue study participant . The resource include : hospital admission , inpatient day , ITU day , outpatient consultation , A &amp; E attendance , primary care surgery home visit . SAMPLE SIZE : Our preliminary pilot study power detect 50−metre difference incremental shuttle walk 5 % significance level 90 % power . Based health resource usage data collect pilot study , detect 50 % reduction hospital readmission rate 5 % significance level 80 % power would require minimum 60 patient ( 30 group ) . We propose study 80 patient study References : 1 .
