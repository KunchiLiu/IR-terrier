	<brief_title>Safety Study Oxaliplatin 5-fluorouracil Followed FUDR Unresectable Colorectal Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects plan undergo surgery placement HAI therapy pump consider enrollment . Standard HAI therapy require laparotomy placement intrahepatic arterial catheter connect one several commercially available subcutaneous electronic pump . The pump use deliver FUDR directly liver , usually begin four week surgery last average period six twelve month study . Current HAI therapy regimen often alternate FUDR systemic chemotherapy . This study examine addition one hour isolate hepatic perfusion 5-FU Oxaliplatin prior standard treatment . Subjects give consent form review sufficient time review information , interested subject opportunity ask question investigator . Subjects interested enrol trial sign inform consent clinical data collect chart ensure meet eligibility requirement . The study consist one hour isolate liver perfusion perform time laparotomy place HAI therapy pump . Following surgery subject monitor ICU 24-48 hour potentially hospital additional 5-7 day . Subjects free start standard HAI therapy regimens four six week follow surgery . The duration treatment , dose HAI therapy decision combine HAI systemic chemotherapy discretion treat physician .</detailed_description>
