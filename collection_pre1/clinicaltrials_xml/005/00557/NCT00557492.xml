	<brief_title>Efficacy Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation Potentially Resectable Pancreas Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 2 stage phase II study bevacizumab ( 10 mg/kg ) fix dose rate ( FDR ) gemcitabine ( 1500 mg/m2 10 mg/kg/min ) combination sequential rapid fractionation radiotherapy ( 30 Gy total ) preoperative treatment potentially-resectable subject adenocarcinoma pancreas . The purpose study determine rate margin negative surgical resection ( R0 resection rate ) rate complete pathological response patient resect pancreas cancer . The overall goal study determine merit novel regimen study Phase III trial examine time progression overall survival . Based need 48 evaluable subject evaluate primary endpoint , study open target accrual 60 subject give expect 20 % rate attrition observe prior study subject pancreas cancer UPCI .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic cytologic proof pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Subjects biopsyproven adenocarcinoma pancreas potentially resectable preoperative imaging . Subjects consider potentially resectable use criterion define Pisters ( Pisters et al. , 2001 ) : imaging detects evidence extrapancreatic disease ; evidence tumor extension superior mesenteric artery ( SMA ) celiac axis ( intact fat plane tumor adjacent visceral artery ) , patent superior mesentericportal vein confluence encasement portal superior mesenteric vein . Karnofsky performance status ≥ 80 . No active second malignancy except basal cell carcinoma skin Normal renal , hepatic , hematologic function time enrollment evidence : Serum creatinine level ≤1.6 mg/dl ( Calculated Creat clearance &gt; 50 ) Serum total bilirubin level ≤1.5 X ULN Urine protein excretion ≤ 1+ urine dipstick White blood cell count ≥ 3.5x109/ml per ml platelet count ≥ 100x109 per ml Age &gt; 18 year . Children exclude toxic effect bevacizumab gemcitabine growth development preclinical study . For subject obstructive jaundice , biliary tract must drain temporary plastic short permanent metallic biliary stent . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . DiseaseSpecific Exclusions Subjects receive chemotherapy within 12 month prior study entry . Prior use radiotherapy investigational agent pancreatic cancer . Subjects undergone laparotomy pancreas cancer within 6 week Any evidence metastasis distant organ ( liver , lung , peritoneum ) . Symptomatic endoscopic evidence gastric outlet obstruction • Endoscopic finding suggest tumor erosion gastrointestinal mucosa . Concurrent malignancy evidence active measurable disease except basal cell carcinoma skin . General Medical Exclusions Inability adhere study and/or followup procedure History allergic reaction hypersensitivity study drug ( bevacizumab , gemcitabine , proton pump inhibitor ) . Other concurrent experimental therapy . Because subject immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive subject receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study . BevacizumabSpecific Exclusions Subjects recent surgery ( prior 6 week ) Core biopsy minor surgical procedure , exclude placement vascular access device , within 7 day prior study enrollment Subjects follow comorbid medical condition : History myocardial infarction unstable angina within 12 month prior study enrollment . Ascites Pregnancy/lactation The effect study drug develop human fetus unknown . For reason bevacizumab , gemcitabine , radiation therapy use trial know teratogenic animal study , woman men childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) time study entry 6 month completion study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . A serum pregnancy test female childbearing potential must do prior receive study drug . Due combine effect chemotherapy radiation , breastfeed allow 6 month completion study participation . Regular aspirin use &gt; 325 mg per day Regular NSAID use Bleeding diathesis , coagulopathy , need fulldose anticoagulation INR &gt; 1.5 Known central nervous system metastasis Previous cerebrovascular accident , transient ischemic attack , seizure ( within 6 month ) Serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , diverticulitis , intraabdominal abscess within 6 month prior study enrollment . Recent hemoptysis , Uncontrolled hypertension ( define systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg antihypertensive medication ) Any prior history hypertensive crisis hypertensive encephalopathy New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) grade 2 great congestive heart failure ( see Appendix I ) Prior deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism Urine protein excretion 2+ ≥ 1 g per 24 hour Peripheral vascular disease lower extremity claudication rest pain prior low extremity vascular surgery arterial insufficiency Dyspnea require supplemental oxygen</criteria>
