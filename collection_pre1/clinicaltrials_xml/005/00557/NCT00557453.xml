	<brief_title>The Role Antibiotic Treatment Patients With Acute Mild Cholecystitis - A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cholelithiasis inflammatory biliary tract disease constitute major health problem western country . Acute cholecystitis third major cause emergency admission surgical ward incidence increase increase age . Acute cholecystitis define acute inflammation gallbladder commonly cause gallstone impact cystic duct . The treatment acute cholecystitis varies different medical center around world . In hospital , mainly US , common treatment early laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 72 hour onset symptom / admission . However , UK many center Europe treatment acute cholecystitis conservative ( NPO , IV fluids antibiotic ) laparoscopic cholecystectomy delay . The reason delay surgery differ institution include assumption decreased complication , surgeon OR availability schedule , cost , hospital policy . A recent metanalysis prove similar safety efficacy early delay laparoscopic cholecystectomy . The conversion rate , length operation complication rate ( overall complication rate , intra-abdominal collection , bile leak , CBD injury ) also comparable . At Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center , Mount Scopus patient acute cholecystitis treat conservatively follow delay laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Over year approach prove carry relatively low rate complication , mainly bile duct injury &lt; 1 % , without interruption busy OR schedule . Regardless lack evidence base guideline treatment acute cholecystitis traditional triad NPO , IV fluids antibiotic adopted institution vis-Ã -vis high complication conversion rate early cholecystectomy . The antibiotic treatment associate side effect , cost important unavoidable development bacterial drug resistance . However , date randomize trial prove superiority either one method .</detailed_description>
