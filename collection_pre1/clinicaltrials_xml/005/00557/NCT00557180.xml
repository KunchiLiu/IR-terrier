	<brief_title>Examining Link Between Obesity , Inflammation , Response Asthma Medications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma affect 20 million people United States . It cause many factor , include exposure tobacco smoke , infection , allergen . Recent research suggest may relationship obesity asthma . It fully understand two condition link , inflammation may play role . Obesity-related inflammation may increase risk airway inflammation , thereby elevate risk develop asthma . Increased inflammation relate obesity may also reduce effectiveness inhale steroid asthma medication , include glucocorticoid . Compared people normal weight , people overweight obese may high risk develop glucocorticoid insensitivity , result intolerance glucocorticoid medication . The purpose study examine effect obesity glucocorticoid insensitivity inflammation . This study also examine difference response asthma steroid medication people overweight obese . This study use previously collect data participant two clinical trial NHLBI-funded Asthma Clinical Research Network ( ACRN ) : Best Adjustment Strategy Asthma Long Term ( BASALT ) study ( NCT00495157 ) Tiotropium Bromide Alternative Increased Inhaled Corticosteroid Patients Inadequately Controlled Lower Dose Inhaled Corticosteroid ( TALC ) study . There additional study visit specifically study . Researchers examine blood sample collect participant ' first BASALT TALC study visit analyze level inflammation biomarkers ( include tumor necrosis factor-alpha [ TNF-Î± ] , interleukin-6 [ IL-6 ] , leptin ) proinflammatory cytokine level , influence glucocorticoid insensitivity . Additional BASALT TALC study data , include lung function , asthma symptom , asthma exacerbation , also analyze .</detailed_description>
