	<brief_title>Saracatinib Treating Patients With Metastatic Locally Advanced Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate disease control rate AZD0530 ( saracatinib ) patient metastatic breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate efficacy AZD0530 term overall response rate ( complete partial response ) progression free survival . II . To describe toxicity profile AZD0530 patient population . III . To prospectively explore change circulate tumor cell pre-treatment level patient receive AZD0530 . OUTLINE : Patients receive saracatinib orally ( PO ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
