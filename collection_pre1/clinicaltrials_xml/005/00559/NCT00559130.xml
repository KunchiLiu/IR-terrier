	<detailed_description>Mortality rate acute lung injury ( ALI ) acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) range 38.5 65 % , low mortality acute lung injury ARDS . ARDS/ALI often see part systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) , particularly systemic sepsis . The lung finding parallel damage tissue , namely , widespread destruction capillary endothelium , extravasation protein rich fluid interstitial edema . The alveolar basement membrane becomes damage fluid leak airspace , reduce lung compliance cause ventilation-perfusion mismatch . The important cause ALI/ARDS sepsis , pneumonia , major trauma , pulmonary aspiration , near drowning , burn , inhalation toxic gas ( e.g . ammonia ) , fat embolism , amniotic fluid embolism , eclampsia , drug intoxication ( e.g . aspirin ) , radiation injury mechanical ventilation . Cox colleague demonstrate ovine model ARDS intense acute inflammation trachea bronchi 3 48h injury , accumulation neutrophil , fibrin plasma protein , mucus airway lumen . Immunostaining multiple cytokine ( interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) , IL-1beta , IL-1alpha , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) ) find airway mucous gland , release cytokine airway lumen consider potentially highly significant progression injury . The importance cytokine increasingly realize mechanical lung injury ( common cause ALI/ARDS ) associate mechanical ventilation ( MV ) . Here pathway identical release cytokines/chemokines potentiate extravasation , activation , recruitment leukocyte , cause ventilator-associated lung injury ( VALI ) ventilator-induced lung injury ( VILI ) . Moreover , VALI/VILI perpetuate chronic inflammatory response ALI/ARDS multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) . The purpose study evaluate reduction cytokine , use CytoSorb device , primary secondary endpoint</detailed_description>
