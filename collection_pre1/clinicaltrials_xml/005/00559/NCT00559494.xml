	<brief_summary>While research animal model spinal cord injury provide many promising insight , human study fail produce effective therapy . We propose investigate drug Minocycline ( metalloproteinase inhibitor ) treatment spinal cord injure patient aim limit neurological injury improve neurological outcome . This drug influence several secondary injury mechanism implicate spinal cord injury effective improve outcome spinal cord injury animal model . We also propose examine safety feasibility spinal cord perfusion pressure augmentation protocol IV fluid inotrope medication versus standard maintenance mean arterial pressure subject exhibit decrease perfusion pressure le 75 mmHg . The purpose pilot study 1 ) evaluate feasibility clinical trial protocol Minocycline patient acute spinal cord injury , 2 ) ensure adequate drug dose metabolic effect . After undergo process inform consent , patient agree participate study randomize placebo treatment group double-blind fashion . Clinical neurological examination , patient-reported quality life , functional independence categorization combine serum cerebrospinal fluid laboratory investigation establish pharmacological property safety profile medication group patient . In addition , patient tolerance dose regimen assess . The result study provide preliminary data necessary plan large prospective , randomize , control , double-blind clinical trial ass efficacy assess safety .</brief_summary>
