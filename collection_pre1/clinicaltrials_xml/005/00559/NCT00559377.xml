	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well PET scan use fluoromisonidazole F 18 fludeoxyglucose F 18 work find oxygen tumor cell patient undergo treatment newly diagnose stage 1B , stage II , stage II , stage IV cervical cancer . Diagnostic procedure use positron emission tomography ( PET scan ) , fluoromisonidazole F 18 , fludeoxyglucose F 18 find oxygen tumor cell may help doctor predict patient respond treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Test extent fluoromisonidazole F 18 ( [ ^18F ] FMISO ) uptake predicts survival patient undergo therapy newly diagnose stage IB-IVB cervical cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Test [ ^18F ] FMISO tumor uptake independent predictor response therapy provide additional predictive power fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( [ ^18F ] FDG ) . II . Test [ ^18F ] FMISO tumor uptake predictor response subgroup patient receive radiotherapy . III . Test relationship [ ^18F ] FMISO uptake primary tumor volume primary tumor estimate CT scan . IV . Test reproducibility [ ^18F ] FMISO uptake tumor image patient sequential day test-retest protocol . V. Compare [ ^18F ] FMISO PET PET/CT scan [ ^18F ] FDG PET PET/CT scan test whether [ ^18F ] FMISO independent predictor treatment outcome . OUTLINE : Patients receive fluoromisonidazole F 18 ( [ ^18F ] FMISO ) IV 1 minute follow PET scan . Patients undergo second [ ^18F ] FMISO PET scan 4-8 week later . Patients prior fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( [ ^18F ] FDG ) PET scan part routine clinical management undergo [ ^18F ] FDG PET scan baseline . A subset 10 patient undergo two [ ^18F ] FMISO PET scan within 48-hour period evaluate variability ( test-retest ) image measurement . Patients response therapy follow periodically time disease progression 2 year .</detailed_description>
