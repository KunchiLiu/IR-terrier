	<brief_title>Selumetinib Treating Patients With Papillary Thyroid Cancer That Did Not Respond Radioactive Iodine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Ascertain objective response rate ( complete response partial response ) patient iodine I 131-refractory papillary thyroid cancer treat selumetinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity treatment patient . II . Determine pharmacokinetic profile treatment patient . III . Determine progression-free overall survival patient . IV . Assess proxy measure treatment response ( thyroglobulin PET scan ) patient treat selumetinib . IV . Compare relevant laboratory correlate responder non-responders . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral selumetinib twice daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Archived tissue examine gene mutation , include RET , BRAF , NTRK , RAS , fluorescence situ hybridization and/or polymerase chain reaction fluorescence melt curve analysis . Protein expression ERK phosphorylated ERK assess immunohistochemical staining . Blood sample collect periodically pharmacokinetic analysis biomarker assessment ( thyroglobulin antithyroglobulin autoantibody ) . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
