	<brief_summary>During last decade increase relative proportion life expectancy elderly people industrialised country . Consequently amount elderly disease disability related age increase . It therefore appear paramount gain well understanding disuse immobilisation affect neuromuscular property elderly , well identify train regime ensure effective rehabilitation.The population interest present study elderly individual long term hip-osteoarthritis undergoing hip-replacement operation . The study divide two part , cross-sectional study intervention study . The cross-sectional study investigate muscle size , maximal muscle strength , specific force , neural drive explosive muscle force characteristic elderly individual affect unilateral prolonged disuse due hip-osteoarthritis . The data clearly indicated side hip-osteoarthritis affect marked decrease muscle mass , maximal muscle strength , neural drive explosive muscle force characteristic compare unaffected side . The intervention study investigate elderly patient undergo hip-replacement surgery could benefit additional training early postoperative phase . The data clearly demonstrate resistance training effective safe way increase muscle mass , maximal muscle strength , neuromuscular activity , functional performance decrease hospitalisation period compare regime conventional rehabilitation regimen electrical muscle stimulation . Additionally intervention study demonstrate resistance training effectively induce marked increase explosive muscle force characteristic elderly subject compare rehabilitation regime use electrical muscle stimulation conventional rehabilitation . Furthermore , gain maximal muscle strength explosive muscle force characteristic accompany significant increase EMG amplitude . Furthermore , demonstration explosive muscle force capacity neuromuscular system remain trainable elderly recover prolonged limb disuse major surgery may important implication future rehabilitation program , especially consider importance rapid muscle force capacity postural balance , maximal walk speed task daily life action .</brief_summary>
