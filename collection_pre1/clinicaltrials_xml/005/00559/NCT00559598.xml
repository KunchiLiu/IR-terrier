	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample blood laboratory patient cancer healthy participant may help doctor identify learn protein related cancer . It may also help doctor tell whether patient cancer . PURPOSE : This clinical trial look protein blood sample see well work find pancreatic cancer extrahepatic biliary tract cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Proteins Finding Pancreatic Cancer Extrahepatic Biliary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To explore utility serum proteome pattern early detection diagnosis pancreatic extraheptic biliary tract cancer analyze serum sample participant previously enrol PANKRAS-II study . - To support effort contact participant ( recruit PANKRAS-II study 10 year ago ) diagnose benign biliary-pancreatic disease order discern subsequently develop malignant biliary-pancreatic tumor . - To gather information clinical factor surround date blood extraction may influence proteomic pattern blood sample perform review clinical record participant . OUTLINE : Serum sample analyze proteome pattern . Participants undergo telephone interview medical history ( i.e. , pancreatic biliary tract disease diagnose within past 10 year ) . Medical record review gather information clinical factor surround date blood extraction may influence proteomic pattern blood sample .</detailed_description>
