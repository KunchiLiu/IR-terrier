	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : A positron emission tomography scan procedure small amount radioactive sugar inject vein , scanner use make detailed , computerized picture area inside body tumor cell find . This study look whether drug zoledronic acid interfere ability PET scan find tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well positron emission tomography work give together zoledronic acid find tumor cell patient advance non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine PET response rate zoledronic acid patient non-small cell lung cancer . OUTLINE : Patients receive 1 dose zoledronic acid day 1 follow 3'-deoxy-3'- [ 18F ] fluorothymidine/PET determine standardize uptake value . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
