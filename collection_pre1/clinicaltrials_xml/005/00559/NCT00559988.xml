	<brief_title>Combined Use BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring Predefined Anticoagulation Reduce Stroke Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) atrial flutter ( AFL ) common cardiac arrhythmia associate increase incidence stroke patient additional risk factor . Oral Anticoagulation ( OAC ) reduce stroke risk , arrhythmias frequently intermittent asymptomatic , start OAC therapy often delay electrocardiographic documentation obtain . Technological advance implant dual-chamber cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator ( CRT-D ) device allow early detection real time verification AF/AFL intracardiac electrograms ( IEGM ) automatically transmit clinician . Such remote diagnostic capability might particularly relevant patient asymptomatic AF allow timely treatment . Compared conventional periodic , ( e.g. , quarterly ) office device evaluation , daily remote monitoring may prove superior diagnosis AF prophylactic treatment thromboembolism . The start , stop restart OAC base predefined atrial rhythm-guided strategy conjunction standard risk-stratification scheme could lead good clinical outcome compare conventional clinical care . The study design demonstrate risk reduction thromboembolism proximate episode document AF/AFL bleed potentiate chronic OAC absence AF . Verification premise would impact clinical practice , provide evidence physician use HM guide OAC patient AF/AFL . The result study demonstrate clinical value wireless remote surveillance cardiac rhythm may define critical threshold AF/AFL burden warrant OAC antiarrhythmic drug therapy patient risk stroke</detailed_description>
