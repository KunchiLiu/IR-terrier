	<brief_summary>The propose study validate determine sensitivity new drive simulator , create evaluate drive ability relate study show similar drive performance patient chronic opioid treatment control group . Although commercial version simulator validate certain population certain measure , require re-calibration clinical study . The investigator propose prospective randomize clinical trial evaluate driving skill alcohol consumption use drive simulator . Two group study subject utilized , majority ( 80 % ) receive alcohol placebo different time . A small set study subject ( 20 % ) give placebo trial evaluate learn effect placebo blind effectiveness . Each group take drive test three time point : baseline begin study , 1st dose placebo dose two alcohol placebo beverage . This information allow u evaluate drive ability potentially impairing condition opioid usage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects recruit via discreet flyer distribute around Rush University Medical Campus . Subjects schedule maximum 6 participant evaluate day . Some evaluation day may fall weekend . Study duration estimate 4-5 hour , completion subject driven respective residence . Upon arrival subject complete questionnaire contain demographic information measure evaluate possible alcohol abuse issue . All subject give short driving simulator practice baseline simulator trial . Subjects randomize two group part study , 80 % probability selection group A 20 % probability selection Group P. Group P give placebo learn effect estimate . In addition baseline , group take full drive test two additional time precede alcohol placebo dose . Of two trial Trial # 2 Group A alcohol give . Both group receiver placebo simulator Trial # 1 . Alcohol trial ( Group A ) : The alcohol dose consist 40 % alcohol ( vodka ) liquor beverage contain 2 part orange juice 1 part liquor . The exact amount/volume alcohol determine base factor weight sex reach peak BAC 0.08 % . The primary contrast interest comparison placebo alcohol dose drive simulation trial . Analyses take place general linear model framework , use `` Proc Mixed '' model repeat measure design produce accurate estimate pre-planned comparison well main effect longitudinal estimate . Various outcome variable measure drive ability use , three primary measure : measure weave ( Standard Deviation Lateral Deviation ) , Reaction Time ( RT ) unexpected stimulus , number accident . The placebo , Group P , evaluate estimate effect learn estimate effectiveness placebo sham .</detailed_description>
