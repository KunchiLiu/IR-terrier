ESRD disproportionately affect African Americans , constitute 29 % ESRD patient Medicare ESRD program . The disease result variety disease , diabetes lead underlie cause ( 44 % case ) hypertension second leading cause ( 26 % ) . The proportion ESRD case cause diabetes increase dramatically . Patients age 18 old African American , ESRD , participant FIND CHOICE study may eligible study . FIND , Family Investigation Diabetes Nephropathy , involve multicenter study identify susceptibility gene , , risk , diabetic form kidney disease . CHOICE , Choices Healthy Outcomes Caring ESRD patient ongoing study identifies risk factor cardiovascular outcome ESRD patient . The principle mapping MALD involve genetic variation exist across population . When mix occurs population different ( heterogeneous ) gene , admix offspring inherits chromosome distinct ancestry . However , generation mating , recombination several generation , originally large block DNA African ancestry become part small segment throughout chromosome . The study focus risk allele , , alternative form gene carry disease risk . Risk allele closely related nearby ancestral gene marker find person . Patients undergo collection blood urine genetic testing . Researchers conduct separate analysis study . Case-control analysis ESRD consist 1,150 participant FIND 250 CHOICE . There also 750 control participant FIND . For case-control analysis diabetic ESRD , 750 participant FIND , 125 CHOICE , 750 control FIND . Finally , quantitative trait analysis , look phenotype-meaning visible characteristic produce interaction person 's genetic makeup environment . That analysis involve 350 patient diabetic nephropathy ESRD 750 control FIND .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - End stage renal disease ( ESRD ) near-total loss kidney function result variety disease . ESRD disproportionately affect African Americans ; group comprise 29 % ESRD patient treat Medicare ESRD program , proportion markedly exceed representation general population . - The Family Investigation Diabetes Nephropathy ( FIND ) study ongoing study identify susceptibility gene diabetic form nephropathy , Choices Healthy Outcomes Caring ESRD patient ( CHOICE ) study ongoing prospective study identify risk factor cardiovascular outcome ESRD patient . Participants study already recruit characterized respect renal phenotype ; furthermore , DNAs individual already collect isolated . In study , intend genotype marker suitable MALD analysis African Americans . The central hypothesis present study renal disease susceptibility alleles present high frequency African Americans white specific region genome African Americans contain marker allele admixture linkage disequilibrium ESRD susceptibility allele . Objectives : - The overall objective study identify novel locus , gene , gene product , may partially account excess risk end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) African Americans compare white . - To achieve goal , employ Mapping Admixture Linkage Disequilibrium ( MALD ) analysis , specialized form linkage disequilibrium mapping , perform genome-wide association study approximately 2,500 African-American participant FIND CHOICE study . Eligibility : - Specific Inclusion/Exclusion criterion : African American - Gender minority inclusion . The FIND CHOICE study open men woman ethnicity ; however , due underlie principle MALD analysis , study include African-American participant cohort . Design : - Genotype 1536 African-American MALD marker ( 2 cM average spacing ) utilize DNA approximately 2,500 African-American participant FIND CHOICE . - Perform genome-wide association analysis utilize 2 cM dense genetic map identify chromosomal loci admixture linkage disequilibrium : - ESRD case-control design - ESRD attributable diabetes case-control design - Quantitative renal phenotype - Fine map putative chromosomal region admixture linkage disequilibrium ESRD densely-spaced single nucleotide polymorphism . - A characterization MYH9 gene , mRNA protein encode planned case control . Gene sequence region implicate undertaken . Characterization mRNA product quantity alternative splice evaluate . Experimental characterization MYH9 proteins isoforms , post-translational modification , interaction , immunohistochemical staining perform .</detailed_description>
