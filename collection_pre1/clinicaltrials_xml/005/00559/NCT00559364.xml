	<detailed_description>This study Phase III , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , parallel , placebo-controlled study , assess efficacy safety Viokase® 16 correction steatorrhea patient EPI due CP pancreatectomy . The study include follow phase : screening phase ( 10 day ) , wash-out phase ( 6 7 day ) , randomization phase ( 10 day ) , treatment phase ( 6 7 day ) . In screen phase , patient undergo screen procedure prior entry study . In wash-out phase , stool collection perform allow determination baseline CFA . In randomization phase , patient qualify Treatment Phase ( , patient CFA % 80 % ) randomize study . In treatment phase , patient randomize 2:1 ratio ( Viokase® 16 Placebo ) . In treatment phase , stool collection period perform allow determination CFA % serve ass efficacy Viokase® 16 correction steatorrhea . Follow-up procedure schedule 7 10 day discharge . Patients show abnormal finding , adverse event concomitant medication treatment phase assess via follow-up telephone call . Patients show abnormal finding ( physical examination , vital sign , clinical laboratory test , adverse event , concomitant medication ) treatment phase complete follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
