	<brief_summary>Some HIV-infected individual white blood cell marker know HLA-B*57 appear help control progress disease ; however , HLA-B*57 marker able control infection . This study examine effect give white blood cell HLA-B*57 individual control HIV infection individual control HIV infection , form HIV treatment . All candidate screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test . Both donor recipient volunteer must HIV-positive individual 18 year age old HLA-B*57 marker receive care . Donor candidate must positive HIV antibody test least seven year recent CD4 cell count great 400 cells/mm ? , HIV viral load le 50 copies/mL , previous HIV viral load great 1,000 copies/mL . Recipient candidate must positive HIV antibody test recent CD4 cell count le 400 cells/mm ? HIV viral load great 10,000 copies/mL , must fail least two prior combination antiretroviral regime willing receive resume combination antiretroviral therapy . Donor volunteer exclude take certain antiretrovirals drug , medical history cancer blood-borne illness , medical condition might interfere study . Recipient volunteer exclude medical history malignant cancer medical condition might possibly interfere study . Donors undergo apheresis separate white blood cell circulate blood red blood cell plasma return bloodstream . The procedure take five hour , donor require return additional test . Donors may ask return white blood cell donation , maximum six procedure per year . Recipients undergo apheresis obtain stem cell possible use study , admit NIH Clinical Center inpatient unit receive infusion white blood cell undergo series blood test infusion . The infusion process take two hour . After discharge , recipient ask return Clinical Center monitor follow-up test , may receive infusion ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Improvements human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV/AIDS ) treatment United States make disease many case chronic illness . However , many individual fail multiple line standard therapy , thus , development new mode salvage treatment crucial . Restriction viral replication , mediate CD8+ cell , appear play important role control HIV replication . A subset individual , many posse human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) B*57 exhibit restriction HIV type 1 viral replication le 50 copies/mL , presumably mechanism CD8+ T-cell mediate , become elite long-term non-progressors ( LTNP ) , evidence progressive immunodeficiency development opportunistic complication many year follow-up . Other individual , include HLA-B*57 show evidence control HIV replication , without antiretroviral therapy develop progressive immunodeficiency HIV-related opportunistic complication . In exploratory study , investigate novel cell transfer strategy : 3 patient HIV infection fail least 2 standard regimen antiretroviral therapy , CD4+ count 200 cells/mm ( 3 ) , plasma HIV viral load great 10,000 copies/mL , administer 10 ( 10 ) peripheral blood mononuclear cell obtain lymphapheresis `` elite '' LTNP match recipient least one HLA-B allele . Up 70 patient may enrol screen identify 3 donor 3 recipient . Up 3 infusion may administer per patient , infusion occur frequently every 3 month . The primary endpoint safety infusion survival donor cell recipient . Changes recipient CD4+ CD8+ cell number , immune parameter , plasma HIV viral load also monitor closely evidence anti-HIV activity .</detailed_description>
