	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Giving chemotherapy radiation therapy entire body autologous peripheral stem cell transplant stop growth cancer cell stop divide kill . The patient 's stem cell return patient replace blood-forming cell destroy chemotherapy radiation therapy . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect give combination chemotherapy together without total-body irradiation follow stem cell transplant see well work treat patient non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To evaluate outcome patient poor-risk , age-adjusted International Prognostic Index high- high-intermediate-risk , intermediate- high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma undergo high-dose therapy comprise etoposide cyclophosphamide , either carmustine total-body irradiation , autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) give consolidation therapy . - To evaluate role high-dose therapy ASCT first partial complete remission ( 1PR/CR ) patient poor-risk primary mediastinal large cell lymphoma . - To evaluate role high-dose therapy ASCT first 1PR/CR patient advanced-stage mantle cell lymphoma . - To evaluate short-term long-term toxicity high-dose therapy ASCT perform 1PR/CR patient poor-risk aggressive lymphoma . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord disease ( diffuse mix , diffuse large cell , immunoblastic lymphoma v primary mediastinal large cell lymphoma v small noncleaved cell lymphoma v stage IV mantle cell lymphoma ) . Patients ' peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) collect mobilization . A minimum 2.0 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg must collect . Patients experience disease progression stem cell collection remove study . Patients assign undergo 1 2 therapeutic regimen . - Regimen 1 : Patients undergo total-body irradiation ( TBI ) day -8 -5 receive etoposide IV 4 hour day -4 cyclophosphamide IV 2 hour day -2 . Patients undergo autologous PBSC transplantation day 0 . - Regimen 2 ( patient receive prior thoracic irradiation patient underwent previous irradiation precludes use TBI ) : Patients receive carmustine IV 2 hour day -7 -5 . Patients receive etoposide cyclophosphamide undergo autologous PBSC transplantation regimen 1 . Patients residual bulky disease great 5 cm may undergo involved-field radiotherapy transplantation . Patients follow day 7 , 14 , 21 , 100 180 PBSC transplantation , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
