	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Open Label Dose Escalation Study Acadesine B-CLL Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I/II , open-label , escalate dose number dos study involve 30-40 patient B-CLL . A patient fail reach final assessment visit due reason occurrence dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) may replace . Eligible patient enrol Part I Part II study cohort three patient . There requirement stagger Day 1 dose patient cohort minimum 48 hour . In first part study ( Part I ) patient receive single dose acadesine Day 1 . In second part study ( Part II ) , patient receive 5 dos treatment period 20 day start Day 1 . In Part I study , start dose 50 mg/kg give 4 hour iv infusion Day 1 . Patients continue assess safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics three week dose ( Day 22 ) . The decision escalate next dose separate cohort patient base assessment safety , include DLTs , pharmacokinetic modelling ( PKM ) exposure ZMP pharmacodynamic response data , available , independent Data Monitoring Board ( DMB ) . A DLT define Grade 3 4 toxicity , may local injection site systemic , observe within 21 day dose consider related study drug . The dose escalate PKM indicate exposure ZMP reach plateau . Dose escalation continue new cohort accordance rule describe follow table . The dose dose escalation stop consider Optimal Biological Dose ( OBD ) dose start dose use Part II study ass repeat dose acadesine . The OBD review DMB prior start Part II study . If DLT note give cohort Part I , follow dose escalation rule follow ascertain maximum administer dose ( MAD ) . In unlikely event DLT see ≥ 2 patient start dose use Part I , study may resume low dose adequate evidence desire pharmacodynamic effect , ie reduction B-cell count , start dose . Dose escalation Part I study shall follow modify Fibonacci dose escalation design , 100 % dose escalation allow Grade 2 toxicity consider related treatment confirm ( define NCI CTCAE v3.0 ) . If occurs , future escalation shall incremental ( 67 % , 50 % , 40 % , 33 % , etc ) , MAD confirm . Intermediate dose level may evaluate indicated acquire safety PK data . In Part I study , blood sample PK analysis ( acadesine metabolite ZMP ) take pre-dose 0 , 30 , 60 minute , 2 , 6 , 20 , 72 , 96 , 168 hour , 14 21 day post-dose cohort . Predictive modelling repeat dose pharmacokinetics carry used conjunction safety pharmacodynamic data predict suitable multiple dose regimen Part II clinical study , 5 dos administer regular interval period 20 day . The Part II dose decision base review data DMB . In Part II one additional acadesine dose administer successive new cohort enrol . The decision add additional dose separate cohort patient base assessment safety , include DLTs , PKM exposure ZMP , pharmacodynamic response data , available , DMB . Blood sample PK analysis Part II study take pre-dose 0 , 30 , 60 minute , 2 , 6 , 20 , 72 , 96 , 168 hour post-dose first last day dose also pre-dose 0 minute post-dose interim dos . Samples also take 14 21 day completion last dose patient . As Part I , patient Part II continue follow 21 day last dose acadesine . If 1 3 patient experience DLT , 3 patient recruited cohort . If ≥ 2 patient 6 experience DLT , dose stop cohort cohort patient may enrol receive 5 administration acadesine low dose ( intermediate dose ) 20 day period , base safety , pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic data . The decision continue low dose base review DMB . Sampling time pharmacokinetic assessment may alter study base data collect order fully define pharmacokinetic profile acadesine ZMP . The total volume blood required assessment increase .</detailed_description>
