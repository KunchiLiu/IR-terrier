	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study compare 2 different method check lymph gland ( middle chest ) cancer cell . Objectives : The aim prospective study determine stag accuracy endobronchial ultrasound guide fine needle aspiration biopsy mediastinal lymph node compare 'gold standard ' , mediastinoscopy , patient clinical Stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer . Primary Objective : To determine sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , accuracy EBUS-FNA mediastinoscopy identify mediastinal nodal metastasis . Secondary Objectives : To estimate quantitative qualitative difference regard sample mediastinal node ( number location node biopsied , number location positive node , extracapsular extension , ability biopsy contralateral node ) . To determine frequency change plan therapeutic management result outcome EBUS-FNA mediastinoscopy . To determine procedure related complication . To perform analysis cost EBUS-FNA mediastinoscopy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endobronchial Ultrasound Versus Mediastinoscopy Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current procedure use check cancer cell lungs small operation base neck ( mediastinoscopy ) get sample lymph gland . These sample look microscope see contain cancer cell . A procedure developed may allow doctor get sample lymph gland without perform operation . This call endobronchial ultrasound `` EBUS '' . The purpose study compare 2 procedure . If agree take part study , insurance provider contact . In order take part study , insurance provider must agree pay EBUS mediastinoscopy procedure . If insurance provider agree pay procedure , schedule EBUS mediastinoscopy . The procedure schedule day . You first EBUS . You receive general anesthesia small flexible scope pass windpipe . Samples lymph gland tissue collect tiny needle pass scope . This performed patient procedure . If tumor find opposite side chest another tumor EBUS , mediastinoscopy necessary . If tumor find opposite side chest another tumor EBUS , mediastinoscopy . This also outpatient procedure involve small ( 2 cm ) cut base neck , breast bone . Your doctor pas special scope camera chest ( breast bone ) . This allow doctor see lymph gland around windpipe get sample . This also perform general anesthesia able leave hospital shortly procedure . Depending whether lymph gland cancer , doctor recommend best therapy tumor . This investigational study . The EBUS FDA approve . The mediastinoscopy consider standard care . The comparison 2 procedure investigational . Up 100 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

Patient must prove suspected NSCLC prior registration . Patients obtain subsequent pathologic confirmation NSCLC time EBUS subsequent surgery remain enrolled study . Patients subsequently find etiology NSCLC exclude analysis . 5 . Patient must anticipate definitive therapy primary NSCLC . This may include surgery , chemotherapy , radiation therapy combination . 6 . Patient must medically fit definitive therapy . 7 . Patient patient 's legally acceptable representative must provide sign dated write informed consent prior registration studyrelated procedure . 1 . Patient receive prior chemotherapy radiotherapy cancer . 2 . Patient consider poor risk due nonmalignant systemic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , etc . ) would preclude treatment option . 3 . Patient contraindication either endobronchial ultrasound mediastinoscopy : Latex allergy ; Bleeding diathesis ; Previous mediastinoscopy ; Previous mediastinal nodal resection ; Previous tracheostomy . 4 .
