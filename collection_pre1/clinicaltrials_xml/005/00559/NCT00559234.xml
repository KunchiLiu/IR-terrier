	<brief_summary>This study evaluate potential candidate future clinical research study relate diagnose undiagnosed genetic eye disorder diseases . It test new treatment , may arrange standard treatment exist eye disorder . The purpose study train eye doctor medical researcher National Institutes Health appropriate method procedure treat patient genetic eye disease , expand pool possible participant future research study trials eye health . Volunteers study may adults minor child diagnose risk genetic eye disease . Candidates may medical condition would interfere researcher ' ability perform examination procedure require study . Participants give complete medical family history undergo series test procedures part research study . The procedure include full eye examination vision testing , electrooculography electroretinogram examine function retina , flourescein angiography provide information flow blood participant 's eye . Participants provide research material study give blood sample hold genetic testing analysis , adult participant also undergo skin biopsy provide cell tissue additional research material . At clinic visit , participant receive treatment genetic eye disease need , include medication surgical procedure . Participants may remain part study three year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The National Eye Institute conduct study evaluate participant either diagnose undiagnosed genetic condition may eligible wish participate NEI clinical research study . The primary purpose evaluation treatment protocol provide resource patient specific new research protocols staff fellowship training . A secondary purpose provide long-term follow-up treatment variety genetic eye disease genetic specialist NEI well able identify research hypotheses disease , may lead idea future protocol . Finally , ability provide long-term follow-up care also facilitate referral effort new NEI protocol . As by-product research activity , participant help investigator maintain clinical skill .</detailed_description>
