	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study Chemo-Immunotherapy Combination Melanoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , become increasingly accept , order induce clinically effective antitumor response , immunotherapy need combine chemotherapy . Thus , traditional perception chemotherapy immunotherapy act unrelated mechanism may antagonistic challenged premise select panel drug induce immunogenic cell death produce specific danger signal . Furthermore , chemotherapy combine immunotherapy may affect antigen cross-presentation , induce `` cytokine storm '' , reduce number regulatory T cell activate homeostatic lymphoid proliferation . Our previous result obtain mouse model , demonstrate drug-induced cytokine favour antitumor immunity . Based observation , explore whether administration dacarbazine ( DTIC ) disease-free melanoma patient combination peptide vaccination could result improved anti tumor immune response . Patients include study assign two treatment arm either receive anti-tumor vaccination Melan-A gp100 analog peptide alone ( arm 1 ) combination DTIC pre-treatment ( arm 2 ) . Arm 1 , vaccine alone : patient receive i.d . injection Melan-A : 26-35 ( A27L ) gp100 : 209-217 ( 210M ) peptide ( 250 µg ) formulate Montanide ISA-51 plus s.c. injection 3MU IFN-α , adjuvant day 1 8 every 21 day total 5 course ( 10 vaccination ) . Both peptide IFN-α inject close separate site next local lymph node . Arm 2 , DTIC plus vaccine : vaccination schedule combine DTIC ( 800 mg/mq i.v . ) administer one day vaccine administration accord standard treatment .</detailed_description>
