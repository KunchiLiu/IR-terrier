	<brief_summary>This study examine risk workplace exposure benzene , substance know lead cancer blood possibly lung . It use widely industry contaminant environment . Researchers National Cancer Institute China Center Disease Control ( formerly Chinese Academy Preventive Medicine ) do previous study worker manufacture industry China people work least 1 day 1972 1987 12 city country . Data collect approximately 75,000 worker expose benzene 35,000 , purpose investigate relationship benzene exposure cancer risk . For worker expose benzene , significant risk cancer affect blood cell 1.8-fold excess lung cancer among . This study expand finding also identify effect benzene amount whether genetic tendency benzene poisoning . About 3,860 benzene-exposed worker 12 city interview . Next-of-kin deceased worker , subcohort ( additional grouping ) participant serve control group research . Patients work place exposure benzene brief physical exam sample cell mouth rinse sample blood collect study genetic influence develop blood disease workplace exposure . All participant next-of-kin , deceased , give questionnaire work history , use cigarette hair dye , medication take , family history cancer . Interviews 40 minute long conduct participant home workplace , time convenient , interview audiotaped .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Benzene know leukemogen may cause lymphoma well , ability , cause condition 10 part per million ( ppm ) air unclear . It currently regulate United States 1 ppm 8-hour time-weighted average 5 ppm short-term exposure level 15 minute . There critical need ass risk related benzene exposure 10 ppm widely use industrially ubiquitous contaminant environment . The National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Chinese Academy Preventive Medicine ( CAPM ) , whose name recently change China Center Disease Control ( CDC ) previously establish cohort 75,000 worker expose benzene 12 city China 35,000 unexposed comparison worker , investigate relationship benzene exposure cancer risk , 1972 1987 . We follow worker use factory record report result suggest benzene exposure 10 ppm may associate increase risk acute non-lymphocytic cancer could also associate increase risk lymphoma lung cancer . We lay groundwork epidemiologic investigation China evaluate health risk low level benzene exposure , particularly present factory 1990s . The cohort follow 1999 , effort identify 3260 subject study , include case ( HLD malignancy , n= 161 ; benzene poisoning , n= 1040 ; lung cancer , n= 560 ) 1500 subject cohort sub-sample use comparison group . In addition , identify series case benzene poison control factory outside cohort ( n = 600 ) . We propose contact next-of-kin decease subject ( essentially cancer case member sub-cohort decease ) , questionnaire-based evaluation benzene exposure , contact living subject ( primarily benzene poisoning case sub-cohort sample ) collection questionnaires biologic sample . The questionnaire ( format direct interview live subject next-of-kin ) collect information potential confounders need analysis benzene 's effect information work experience outside study cohort factory . The biologic sample collection ( 13 ml blood buccal cell rinse ) provide material primarily study genetic polymorphism potentially associate benzene metabolism disease status . The polymorphism study relatively common Chinese population may associate relatively modest increase risk ( 1.5 2-fold ) . Written inform consent obtain next-of-kin live study subject . We attempt enroll 3,860 study subject next-of-kin . The study carry Drs . Gui-Lan Li Song-Nian Yin colleague China CDC , Beijing , China .</detailed_description>
