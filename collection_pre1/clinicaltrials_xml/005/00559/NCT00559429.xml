	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer remain lead cancer diagnose men USA . It estimate 232,090 new case diagnosed 2003 , account 30 % cancer case diagnose men . ( 1 ) Prostate cancer still second lead cause cancer death men ( lung cancer ) US estimate 28,900 men die prostate cancer 2003 . Although 79 % men present early stage disease ( i.e. , local regional ) time diagnosis , substantial number men present metastatic disease . ( 2 ) Unfortunately many patient present local disease treat local therapy eventually experience disease recurrence . Initial treatment patient prostate cancer advance stage androgen deprivation . Approximately 85 % men objective response hormonal therapy initially eventually patient develop progressive eventually fatal disease . Treatment option patient HRPC include systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy /or palliation symptom ( especially pain ) ( 3 ) . Single agent combination chemotherapy regimens associate objective response rate range 40-70 % patient HRPC ( 4 ) . No survival advantage show treatment phase III study . More effective systemic therapy need impact morbidity mortality cause disease . ( 5 ) A new bone target approach combination radioisotopes chemotherapy . In addition inherent systemic benefit chemotherapeutic agent also act radiosensitizers combined radiopharmaceutical . Preliminary clinical experience combination radiopharmaceutical systemic chemotherapy indicate approach feasible tolerable potentially effective . In randomized phase II trial metastatic HRPC patient treat chemotherapy : Ketoconazole Doxorubicin alternate Vinblastine Estramustine ( KAVE regimen ) . Seventy-two patient stable respond 2-3 cycle randomize receive consolidation treatment additional 6 weekly doxorubicin treatment single dose 89Sr weekly doxorubicin alone . Patients receive combined consolidation treatment significantly long time progression survival ( 27.7 vs.16.8 month . P=0.0014 ) . ( 20 ) Docetaxel clearly represent active single agent treatment metastatic prostate cancer . The radiosensitizing property Docetaxel well document preclinical clinical experiment . The likely underlying mechanism G2M block cell cycle induce docetaxel result cycle cell radiosensitive phase cell cycle . Besides palliative role , current clinical preclinical data suggest bone target approach may represent potentially useful component overall therapeutic approach metastatic prostate cancer . Randomized , double-blind , placebo control trial suggest bisphosphonates endothelin A antagonist may delay progression prostate cancer bone . These clinical observation relatively large trial provide impetus design large definitive study evaluate role various bone target approach treatment prostate cancer . The currently propose trial represent preliminary evaluation safety docetaxel +153 Sm combination . This study may also provide important preliminary efficacy information combination . The combination regimen design explore clinically possible interaction docetaxel samarium-153-EDTMP . The block G2/M phase follow administration docetaxel result accumulation cell radiosensitive phase cell cycle . Pre-clinical data suggest likely occur 24-48hrs post administration docetaxel . This follow 24 hour later administration radiopharmaceutical short physical half life 46.3 hour . The bone uptake complexed sm153- EDTMP molecule effectively take bone metastatic site within time interval . To target cell repopulating cell cycle follow initial block+ cell kill mitotic phase , plan Q3 week x 2 administration docetaxel Day 1 Day 22 . Following 8 week rest ( week 5 -12 ) , treatment repeat maximum 2 cycle development dose-limiting toxicity disease progression . Samarium give 12 week interval . Docetaxel radiosensitizer show activity prostate cancer give patient Q3 week Q week schedule . Based personal communication Dr. Theodore DeWeese 's ( Johns Hopkins Hospital Radiation Oncologist ) preclinical data suggest 24 hour dose docetaxel , maximum G2M arrest . This represent rationale bolus dose docetaxel combine schedule .</detailed_description>
