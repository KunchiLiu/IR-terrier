	<brief_summary>Cardiac arrest sustain VT ( ventricular tachycardia ) patient heart disease best treat ICD ( implantable cardioverter defibrillator ) . However , ICD alone appropriate therapy patient frequent VT episode . In fact frequent shock VT may predict poor prognosis . Anti-arrhythmic drug co-administered ICDs 50 % patient prevent VT episode , antiarrhythmic drug may harmful effect . Thus improve drug prevent VT without interfere ICD function need . Recent data include suggest clonidine may new therapy prevent ICD shock . It may act centrally sympathetic outflow peripherally selectively cardiac Purkinje , suppress control VT occur patient . Our purpose test hypothesis clonidine reduce frequent VT good beta blocker patient ICDs . After informed consent patient randomize single blind fashion either clonidine metoprolol give three time per day . Other prescribed drug may adjust promote toleration study drug . ICD interrogation episodes VT primary endpoint . Device base NIPS ( non-invasive program stimulation ) test subset patient allow mechanistic understanding clonidine effect . All procedural technique place perform clinically ; preliminary data give show feasibility project .</brief_summary>
