	<brief_summary>This study help permit development preventative strategy well cell-cased therapy existent disease . It hypothesize age associate reduced vascular injury-induced endothelial progenitor cell activity , result impaired vascular repair increase vascular disease . Patients stable coronary artery disease control group patient undergo coronary angiography without angioplasty recruit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease lead cause morbidity mortality society . It initiate dysfunction line coronary artery . There several repair mechanism think involve circulate endothelial progenitor cell mobilize bone marrow home sit endothelial injury . We hypothesize age associate reduced vascular injury induce endothelial progenitor cell activity , result impaired vascular repair increase coronary heart disease event . 96 patient stable coronary artery disease enrol study . They undergo either angiography alone angiography angioplasty . Their venous blood collect immediately prior procedure 20-24 hour procedure . The number endothelial progenitor cell assess base ability form colony also migrate influence certain growth factor . These value compare sample . All patient also contact 6 month , 2 5 year participation study clinical outcome coronary artery disease correlate number aforementioned cell .</detailed_description>
