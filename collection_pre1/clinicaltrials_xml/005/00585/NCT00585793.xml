	<detailed_description>There grow demand treatment access antiretroviral ( ARV ) therapy HIV infection resource - poor setting . Of HIV-1 subtypes ( A , B , C , D , F , G , H , J , K multiple recombinant virus ) , ARV drug develop study primarily subtype B . This HIV subtype predominates North America , Western Europe rest industrialize world . However , worldwide , subtype B make minority ( 10 % ) HIV infected population . In Uganda , HIV-1 subtypes A D predominate . Although evidence ARV 's developed subtype B virus activity non-subtype B virus , demand grow ARV 's resource-poor setting , entirely clear whether non-B subtypes respond robustly current ARV 's available . Also , unknown drug failure ( form viral resistance ) non-subtype B virus due mutation similar see subtype B virus . Without data resource-poor country , still early tell whether different HIV-1 subtypes require unique drug treatment salvage strategy fail initial therapy . The University Wisconsin ( UW ) Health HIV Care Program partnering Mulago Hospital Pediactirc Infectious Disease Clinic ( PIDC ) past five year . The PIDC well 5,000 child HIV attend clinic . Approximately 20 % child meet criterion ARV treatment US PEPFAR ( Presidents Emergency Plan AIDS Relief ) arrangement . A retrospective collaborative ( UW/PIDC ) study perform PIDC examine ( use genotyping ) 40 child fail initial ARV therapy . This study find different mutation child fail antiretroviral therapy . Based upon study , goal present cohort study examine prospectively expand population child attend PIDC relationship HIV subtype infect Ugandan child virologic clinical response ARV 's available population . Approximately 30 % child currently fail ( base primarily upon clinical data ) ARV therapy PIDC . In study , child separate tube 5 cc blood drawn ( specify time ) HIV subtyping examine whether specific subtypes HIV associate failure specific ARV 's ARV combination . In addition HIV subtype determination , viral genotyping ( viral mutation ) perform examine relationship HIV subtype specific viral mutation indicate resistance ARV . The overall design study prospectively collect cohort clinical virologic data child ( age birth 16 year ) start ARV therapy 12 month period enrollment ( 110 child qualify PEPFAR ARV treatment ) . The inclusion criterion child receives ARV therapy . The exclusion refusal part patient family blood drawn record examine . Children receive ARV therapy time period approach recruit study attend physician . This study approve University Wisconsin Hospital Clinics Mulago Hospital IRBs . All treat child clinical HIV genotype subtype data ( blood send U. Wisconsin analysis ) collect prior start ARV 's . Children receive initial therapy HIV infection 2 NRTIs ( AZT , d4T , ABC ddI ) 1 NNRTI ( Neverapine , Efavirenz ) Kaletra ( protease inhibitor ) . One month start ARVs ( every four month thereafter study period ) HIV viral load obtain . If child fail therapy , clinical data time failure collect blood drawn repeat viral load , HIV-1 subtyping ( subtype change ) , genotypic analysis ( see ) . Decisions use treatment child fail first antiretroviral regimen make use data collect blood obtain child study . ARV failure PIDC generally assess clinical ground ( weight loss , diarrhea , fever , opportunistic infection [ OI ] etc ) . The PIDC fairly sophisticate data management system . In child clinical failure ARV 's initial therapy , blood HIV-1 viral load , subtype genotype drawn . This blood frozen ship University Wisconsin analysis . On site ( Dr. Kekitiinwa ) clinical data collect . This data include age , sex , physical finding clinical course ARV 's . More specifically , reason ARV failure : occurrence OI , wasting , recurrence diarrhea , ( symptom HIV ) , toxicity ARV ( tolerability ) . All blood sample label number corresponds identity patient . This number keep Dr. Graziano . These sample Federal Expressed dry ice University Wisconsin evaluate HIV-1 subtype genotype . No material inducement recruitment offer personnel PIDC receive incentive recruitment subject . This study minimal risk patient . ARV therapy standard care PIDC infect HIV AIDS . T-tests significance population cohort analysis perform examine whether correlation HIV-1 subtype , clinical failure , appearance specific genetic resistant mutant . There statistical justification sample size . The risk study bruise transient pain blood drawn analysis ( see consent form ) . Since AIDS devastate disease Uganda ARV therapy represent hope HIV infected child , particular concern examination medical record child . There cultural sensitivity draw blood PIDC population . The clinical benefit study participant research knowledge mutation ( fail therapy ) start second line therapy . Physicians care patient administer consent form . All fluent English ( national Uganda language ) Lugandan ( prevalent dialect Kampala surround area ) . See consent form ( What signatures thumb print mean ) enclose detail .
