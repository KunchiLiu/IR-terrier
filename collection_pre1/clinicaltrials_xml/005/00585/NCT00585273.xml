	<brief_summary>Over last decade , second generation antipsychotic increasingly utilized . Since introduction , however , atypical antipsychotic increasingly associate significant metabolic complication include hyperlipidemia , insulin resistance/diabetes mellitus , obesity . These metabolic complication increase risk cardiovascular disease population already elevate risk . The initial goal propose study identify early sign endothelial dysfunction vascular disease treat atypical antipsychotic . The identification early sign vascular disease may link metabolic complication cardiovascular risk . Demonstration change vascular function associate atypical antipsychotic represent important identifiable intermediate long-term cardiovascular risk . The second goal propose study identify genetic factor may associate development cardiovascular disease , later serve guide predict risk . Accurate prediction risk may facilitate future development empirical , risk-based , individualized selection process antipsychotic medication . Aim 1 : To quantify role antipsychotic-induced metabolic complication development vascular disease use measure endothelial function . Hypothesis 1 : Atypical antipsychotic lead great impairment endothelial function , evidence decrease flow-mediated dilation baseline measure compare change time control . Medication-induced metabolic complication temporally associate impairment endothelial function . Aim 2 : To investigate role candidate pharmacogenetic polymorphism cardiovascular metabolic complication atypical antipsychotic . Hypothesis 2 : Profiles polymorphisms receptor target atypical antipsychotic associate impaired cardiovascular function metabolic complication .</brief_summary>
