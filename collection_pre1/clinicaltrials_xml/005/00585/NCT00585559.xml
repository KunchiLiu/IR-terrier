	<brief_title>Acetaminophen aSAH Inhibit Lipid Peroxidation Cerebral Vasospasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( aSAH ) often devastate form stroke high morbidity mortality despite advance surgical management . Approximately 30,000 patient annually suffer aSAH U.S. For patient survive initial subarachnoid hemorrhage , delayed cerebral vasospasm occur day 4-14 great cause neurological disability death . A grow body evidence incriminate hemoprotein-catalyzed lipid peroxidation mediator vasospasm . Hemoglobin release lysed red cell subarachnoid space become oxidize , state act pseudoperoxidase generates protein radical induce lipid peroxidation . F2-isoprostanes form lipid peroxidation highly potent constrictor cerebral arteriole . We demonstrate 5 fold mean increase F2-isoprostanes cerebrospinal fluid patient aSAH ; increase maximal time delay vasospasm , level increase function severity aSAH . We hypothesize vasoconstrictor major contributor vasospasm produce hemoprotein , hemoglobin myoglobin , disease release cellular confines . We discover acetaminophen ( APAP ) potent inhibitor hemoprotein-catalyzed lipid peroxidation IC50 hemoglobin 15 uM , range plasma level result therapeutic dos drug human . Acetaminophen act reduce ferryl-oxo radical form heme , thereby prevent formation hemoprotein radical initiate lipid peroxidation . To assess proof concept vivo , determine effect acetaminophen rat model rhabdomyolysis renal failure result intense vasospasm . Acetaminophen block lipid peroxidation model , prevent renal failure dose produce plasma level therapeutic range human . We also demonstrate N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) inhibit hemoprotein-catalyzed lipid peroxidation . Moreover , NAC administration increase level glutathione vivo , glutathione co-substrate glutathione peroxidase reduce level peroxide environment aSAH . This important acetaminophen potent inhibit hemoprotein-catalyzed lipid peroxidation peroxide concentration low . This concerted evidence basis hypothesis NAC augment efficacy acetaminophen inhibitor hemoprotein-catalyzed lipid peroxidation aSAH . These find provide rationale pilot study seek proof concept acetaminophen-based regimen inhibit lipid peroxidation patient subarachnoid hemorrhage . Lipid peroxidation determine analysis F2-isoprostanes cerebrospinal fluid . If inhibition see , would provide basis large multi-center investigation ass effect clinical endpoint . This pilot study determine whether APAP , NAC , APAP combination NAC inhibit lipid peroxidation aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage .</detailed_description>
