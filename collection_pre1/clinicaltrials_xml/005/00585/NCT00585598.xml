	<brief_title>Evaluation Supralaryngeal Airway Removal During Initial Resuscitation Trauma Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The esophageal tracheal combitube ( ETC ) first marketed 1987 Frass , Frenzer , Zahler alternative airway traditional endotracheal intubation . The combitube polyvinyl chloride double lumen supraglottic airway place blindly , quickly , minimal training . The device available two size , 37F small adult ( 4-6 foot tall ) 41F large adult ( 198 cm height ) . It widely use Wisconsin pre-hospital airway management algorithm trauma patient . The combitube design two lumen include pharyngeal lumen ( blind distal end blue proximal end allow communication airway via hole position low pharynx ) tracheal lumen ( clear , short proximal portion open distal portion ) . The device also two balloon allow adequate ventilation oxygenation minimize risk aspiration . The oropharyngeal balloon locate pharyngeal perforation inflate ( 85 - 100 mL air ) seal oral nasal cavity . The distal balloon position distal tracheal lumen open seal either esophagus trachea depend upon position inflate . The King LT-D design one lumen , two ventilation aperture locate two inflatable cuff . The distal cuff/balloon seal esophagus . The proximal cuff/balloon seal oropharynx . Ventilation occur proximal end tube . Multiple clinical trial undertake examine safety efficacy ETC &amp; King LT-D use pre-hospital setting . In general , ETC device show superiority laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) , oral airway/bagged mask ventilation , pharyngeal tracheal lumen airway term success rate insertion , ventilation , complication rate . In-hospital use , include use elective operative case 6 hour duration cardiac arrest necessitate CPR , study limited fashion . However , small clinical trial support use ETC &amp; King LT-D first line rescue airway ETT possible . In addition , several study show equivalence ventilation oxygenation ETT ETC use CPR , operate suite , ICU set . However , clinician still view supralaryngeal ETC/King LT-D primarily rescue airway . Although technically possible maintain airway supralaryngeal ETC/King LT-D , endotracheal intubation gold standard . In trauma setting , patient arrive trauma bay supralaryngeal airway place , traditionally exchange ETT primary survey ( initial assessment ) . This exchange possible use number technique widely describe literature . Although skilled anesthesiologist reportedly exchange safely rapidly accord limited number clinical trial , safety exchange primary survey initial resuscitation trauma patient well document . This study prospective clinical trial design evaluate exchange supralaryngeal airway immediately upon arrival trauma bay accord UWHC previously adopt protocol .</detailed_description>
