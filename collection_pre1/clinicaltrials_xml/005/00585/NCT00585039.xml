	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine large , double-blind , randomize , prospective pediatric clinical trial whether use continuous levalbuterol ( Xopenex ) addition standard emergency department treatment acute asthma exacerbation improve Forced Expiratory Volume 1 sec ( FEV 1 ) compare use continuous racemic albuterol . The secondary objective correlate clinical ( hospitalization rate clinical asthma score ) plasma level ( S ) -albuterol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Albuterol Versus Xopenex Treatment Acute Asthma Emergency Department ( ED )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children age 6 17 year inclusive history asthma eligible enrollment present pediatric emergency department moderate severe acute asthma exacerbation . All eligible child enrol whenever study personnel available obtain informed write consent . Children le 6 year age enrol levalbuterol approve child 6 year age great . Children also exclude Forced Expiratory Volume 1 sec ( FEV 1 ) &gt; 70 % predict ( see ) ; history chronic lung disease ( e.g . cystic fibrosis ) , noncorrected congenital heart disease , suspect intrathoracic foreign body , need immediate resuscitation pregnant . Eligible patient identify research assistant attend ED physician notify . The attend ED physician make final decision regard severity base physical exam spirometry ( FEV 1 ) result . The FEV 1 value record calculated percentage predict base standardized height weight chart . All spirometry perform licensed respiratory therapist research assistant train use spirometer . An FEV 1 50 % 70 % predict consider moderate exacerbation le 50 % predict , severe . As child enrol significant asthma exacerbation delay treatment . If consent process carry within first 15 minute upon arrival ED receive standard dose albuterol per stand ED order . A computer generate table random number use assign child treatment group . A locked area ED contain number plastic bag contain either 15 mg racemic albuterol 7.5 mg levalbuterol . Since enrol child ≥ 6 year age weigh &gt; 20 kg therefore receive 7.5 mg racemic albuterol ( 0.5 % , 2.5mg/0.5 ml Nephron Pharmaceuticals ) normal saline ( total volume = 20 ml ) nebulized one hour assign albuterol group ( i.e . equivalent 2.5 mg every 20 minute 3 dos ) . If 6 11 year age receive 1.89 mg levalbuterol ≥ 12 year age 3.75 mg levalbuterol volume normal saline . This would equivalent give 3 treatment every 20 minute one hour . Both study medication identical odor appearance . All child receive 2 mg/kg methylprednisolone maximum dose 60 mg orally within first 20 minute treatment . All child also receive two unit dos ipratropium bromide ( 1000 mcg ) first hour nebulization therapy standard care . Spirometry perform baseline hour bronchodilator treatment child discharge home admit in-patient unit . Patient disposition ED depend response treatment . The ultimate decision admit discharge attending discretion . However , child able perform good loop spirometry FEV1 may use guide decision . An FEV 1 ≥ 70 % predict likely mean discharge home appropriate instruction . Children observe 60 minute last bronchodilator treatment ensure maintain response . Children admit PICU FEV 1 &lt; 50 % require inhaled bronchodilator hourly . If child 's FEV 1 ≥ 50 % &lt; 70 % still experience moderate symptom likely admitted floor treatment ED may allow sufficient improvement discharge . If treatment period one hour FEV1 &gt; 70 % discharge home . If &lt; 70 % admit . Once disposition decide study conclude patient except telephone follow-up child discharge home . All child discharge home call 30 day ED assessment . This call determine child unscheduled ED office visit asthma exacerbation . Data collect include child 's age , weight , height , gender , ethnicity , medication use home , asthma history , asthma score , peak flow , disposition ED , adverse effect , serum level albuterol isomer ( see data collection sheet attach ) . Blood drawn baseline . The serum level albuterol enantiomer require 7 ml blood drawn . Children elect RCT two medication take part part study . Blood sample send lab , spun frozen . The sample store study complete ship outside lab measurement plasma level ( S ) ( R ) albuterol . These plasma level review patient disposition already decide clinically relevant acute management time . There dedicate research personal ED 16 hour day sole purpose identify study candidate ensure procedure follow accord protocol . This ensure continuity study process include placement consent medical record . Since spirometry objective test also allow shift change without need worry different individual measuring FEV1 . Despite ED staff ( physician , fellow , nurse , technician ) inform educate purpose , protocol procedure use study regularly schedule staff meeting .</detailed_description>
