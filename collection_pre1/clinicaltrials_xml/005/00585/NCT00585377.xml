	<brief_title>Bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) + Erlotinib First-line Therapy Stage IIIB/IV Recurrent , Non-squamous Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination Bevacizumab Erlotinib show encouraging activity patient previously treat , non-small-cell lung cancer . In phase I/II study erlotinib bevacizumab patient nonsquamous stage IIIB/IV NSCLC one prior chemotherapy exposure , recommend phase II dose establish erlotinib 150 mg/day orally plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously every 21 day ( 13 ) Forty patient treat recommended Phase II dose . The median age 59 year ( range , 36 72 year ) , 21 female , 30 adenocarcinoma histology , nine never-smokers , 22 &gt; = two prior regimen ( three patient &gt; = four prior regimen ) . The common adverse event mild moderate rash , diarrhea , proteinuria . No pharmacokinetic interaction identify . Eight patient ( 20.0 % ; 95 % CI , 7.6 % 32.4 % ) partial response 26 ( 65.0 % ; 95 % CI , 50.2 % 79.8 % ) stable disease best response . The median overall survival 34 patient treated phase II dose 12.6 month , progression-free survival 6.2 month . These data compare favorably conventional chemotherapy salvage set NCSLC response rate &lt; 10 % median survival 6-8 month ( 14-16 ) . In attempt improve therapeutic index initial therapy metastatic NSCLC , combination bevacizumab erlotinib propose first-line treatment place conventional chemotherapy . The regimen beneficial toxicity reduce efficacy unchanged efficacy improve . Since regimen cause hair loss , minimal nausea cytopenia , nearly eliminate risks infection bleed , combination target agent appear well tolerate conventional chemotherapy . Efficacy may also improve since activity salvage set patient less likely respond treatment rival conventional chemotherapy untreated set . In addition , erlotinib alone untreated set yield result dissimilar chemotherapy similar condition . Hence , hypothesize combination erlotinib plus bevacizumab produce superior result less toxicity . This trial intend provide pilot data future randomize trial combination target agent versus conventional chemotherapy advance NSCLC .</detailed_description>
