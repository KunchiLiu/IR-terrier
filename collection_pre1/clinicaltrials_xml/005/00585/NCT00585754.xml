	<brief_summary>This study aim test preliminary efficacy 3.0 mg guanfacine ( GFC ) daily versus placebo cocaine and/or alcohol dependent individual . This proposal laboratory treatment outcome study examine effect guanfacine brief exposure stress , drug cue neutral situation cocaine/alcohol crave , mood neurobiological reactivity sample cocaine and/or alcohol dependent individual . Guanfacine beneficial reduction stress drug cue induce crave relate arousal . In sample 60 cocaine and/or alcohol dependent men woman , propose examine ( ) differences measure cocaine craving , emotion state , hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) activation , physiological arousal plasma catecholamine response stress imagery drug cue imagery compare neutral imagery ; ( b ) reduction cocaine/alcohol abstinence symptom ; ( c ) improvement cocaine alcohol treatment outcomes measure increase abstinence , reduction cocaine/alcohol use increase treatment attendance . Hypothesis 1 : Guanfacine decrease stress-induced cocaine craving , negative emotion relate arousal laboratory compare placebo . Hypothesis 2a : As compare PLA group , GFC group show significant reduction protract withdrawal symptom measure CSSA/CIWA 9-week treatment period . Hypothesis 2b : As compare PLA group , high percentage GFC patient remain abstinent 9-week treatment period high percent negative cocaine urine alcohol-free day . Hypothesis 2c : The GFC group show great adherence treatment measure day treatment compare Pla group .</brief_summary>
