	<brief_summary>Each year , 400,000 cardiac surgical operation perform United States ; 10,000 perform child . These operation make possible use heart-lung bypass machine , also know cardiopulmonary bypass . This machine allow body support heart repair . While machine life saving , risk lead variety complication . One complication result fact patient 's blood expose foreign material machine , plastic tubing . In nearly case cardiac surgery , lead whole body response patient follow operation . This response , inflammation , characterize alteration function heart lung , fever , fluid retention , bleed disorder postoperative period . While usually temporary self limiting , significant morbidity occur approximately 1-2 % case inflammatory response present . Additionally , child appear susceptible response . This lead significant postoperative complication associate actually surgical procedure perform heart . The exact cause response fully understood . However , important understand trigger , timing , pattern complex inflammatory response order modify arrest . Unlike situation associate type whole-body inflammatory reaction trauma overwhelming infection , cardiac surgical team advantage know trigger occur ( i.e . cardiac operation ) hence opportunity preemptive intervention effort minimize response . One effort focus proposal . Nitric oxide ( NO ) gas use year treatment lung disease infant . It life save safe . Recently , investigate anti-inflammatory effect outside lung . We propose deliver NO source great inflammation cardiac surgery , cardiopulmonary bypass machine . It intention show ; minimize inflammation find first 24 hour follow cardiac surgery child . If correct , reduction inflammation result less damage organs child 's body improve outcome following surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>I. Hypothesis Treatment child surgery employ cardiopulmonary bypass inhale , exogenous nitric oxide ( iNO ) deliver cardiopulmonary bypass circuit : 1 . Modulate ischemia/reperfusion injury 2 . Influence endothelial dysfunction 3 . Ameliorate bypass-triggered systemic inflammatory response II . Specific Aims Three specific aim test hypothesis : Delivery iNO cardiopulmonary bypass circuit result decrease : 1 . Measures end-organ dysfunction often associate CPB ; pulmonary function , cardiac injury marker , serum creatinine , neurologic injury marker . 2 . Measures inflammatory response , specifically IL-6 TNFa via antioxidant property . 3 . Platelet activation aggregation lead reduce transfusion requirement . III . Introduction Background - Cardiopulmonary bypass lead ischemia/reperfusion injury . One mediator injury oxygen radical production . NO known bind oxygen radical specie . - Cardiopulmonary bypass lead endothelial dysfunction . This mediate cell-free hemoglobin bind endogenous NO , see sickle cell disease . - Both factor , separately combination , perpetuate inflammatory response trigger CPB . NO affect response interfere process . Additionally , NO known affect neutrophil chemotaxis well platelet activation aggregation , amplify inflammatory response . IV . Basic Protocol Experimental Design In prospective , randomize , control , blind pilot trial compare 20 ppm iNO deliver CPB circuit . Our study target child undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) surgery correction transposition great artery ( TGA ) Tetralogy Fallot ( TOF ) . Subjects Inclusion Undergoing repair TGA TOF &lt; 16 year age Exclusion Age &gt; 16 year age Pregnancy Known bleed disorder Treatment Protocol Following informed consent , blood drawn pre-operatively baseline characteristic ( methemoglobin , venous saturation , CBC , S100 , gene expression profile , BNP , cTnI , IL-6 , IL-8 , lactate , TNFalpha ) [ Table , Blood sample Study ] . Intra-operatively use standardized anesthetic protocol unless contraindicate specific patient clinical characteristic . Intraoperative measurement include : aortic cross clamp time , total cardiopulmonary bypass time . Intraoperative hemodynamic measurement include : mean systemic blood pressure ( MAP ) , central venous pressure , right atrial pressure pulmonary artery pressure , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( available ) . Blood sample draw follow CPB upon arrival ICU analyze . Repeat blood sample draw 12 , 24 , 48 hour . Patients follow time discharge . Ventilator setting , length ICU hospital stay record . All measurement group . Time point reference time admission PICU group .</detailed_description>
