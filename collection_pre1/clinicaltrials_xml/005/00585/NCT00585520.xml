	<brief_summary>Cocaine dependence chronic , relapse disorder stress/negative mood exposure drug-related stimulus `` cue '' associate high rate relapse ( McKay et al. , 1995 ; O'Brien et al. , 1998 ; R. Sinha , 2001 ; Shaham et al. , 2003 ) . In particular , sex difference relapse precipitant note , woman report great stress relate relapse men report high number relapse associate drug cue/temptation situation ( Lex , 1991 ; McKay et al. , 1996 ; R. Sinha , 2001 ; R. Sinha , Rounsaville BJ , 2002 ) . Current SCOR study show stress cocaine cue increase drug crave stress relate arousal , response differ cocaine men woman ( R. Sinha et al. , 2003 ; H.C. Fox et al. , 2005a ) . Furthermore , stress-induced cocaine crave HPA response predictive cocaine relapse , also moderate gender ( R. Sinha et al. , 2006 ) . However , previous research examine basis sex difference stress cue induce crave arousal , know increase relapse susceptibility . Greater knowledge sex-specific neurobiology cocaine dependence facilitate development gender-specific cocaine relapse prevention effort . Growing evidence support role gonadal hormone explain sex difference observe stress response well behavioral response cocaine ( Festa &amp; Quinones-Jenab , 2004 ; K. Carroll , Fenton LR , Ball SA , Nich C , Frankforter TL , Shi J , Rounsaville BJ , 2004 ; Lynch , 2006 ; Kajanti &amp; Phillips , 2006 ) . Estrogen increase behavioral response cocaine , presence progesterone decrease subjective behavioral effect cocaine , female male ( Jackson et al. , 2006 ; Sofuogu et al. , 1999 ; M. Sofuoglu et al. , 2002 ; Evans &amp; Foltin , 2006 ) . Stress cocaine enhance brain stress circuit , namely corticotrophin release factor ( CRF ) -hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis central noradrenergic/sympatho-adrenomedullary ( SAM ) pathways activate mesolimbic dopaminergic system involve rewarding effect cocaine ( ADD REFS ) . Exposure Stress , cocaine cocaine cue increase cocaine crave HPA axis response . Importantly , progesterone affect behavioral response cocaine , also play key role stress regulation . However , know whether progesterone alters stress-induced drug cue-induced craving related stress arousal , marker predict cocaine relapse outcomes . Our preliminary data suggest woman expose stress drug cue laboratory luteal phase ( high progesterone ) show low stress induced drug cue-induced craving , anxiety cortisol response compare late follicular phase ( high estrogen ) ( see preliminary Studies section CX ) . On basis previous research , propose double-blind placebo control study examine progesterone 's effect stress cue-related response cocaine dependent men woman . We hypothesize high dose progesterone ( 200 mg bid ) vs. placebo alter stress-induced cocaine craving , negative affect , physiological HPA response stress , change great woman men .</brief_summary>
