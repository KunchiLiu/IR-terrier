	<brief_summary>It known administration steroid increase blood sugar level . Administration betamethasone common practice pregnancy woman risk preterm delivery . However , unknown magnitude change glucose woman receive betamethasone . The purpose study determine magnitude time increase blood sugar pregnant woman without diabetes receive steroid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There substantial body evidence administration corticosteroid patient deem risk preterm delivery ( delivery prior 37 week gestation ) decrease risk respiratory distress syndrome , intraventricular hemorrhage , neonatal death . Current recommendation National Institute Health ( NIH ) American College Obstetricians Gynecologists ( ACOG ) patient pregnancies 24-34 week gestation deem risk preterm delivery receive antenatal corticosteroid . The recommended dosing two dose betamethasone 12 mg give 24 hour apart intramuscular injection . ( Alternatively , dexamethasone 6 mg give intramuscularly every 6 hour 4 dos may administer . Betamethasone use preferentially institution . ) Glucocortiocoids well-known effect glucose metabolism . They increase blood glucose level antagonize insulin decrease synthesis insulin , thus inhibit peripheral glucose utilization increase gluconeogenesis ( process body produce glucose ) . Pregnancy also characterize relative insulin resistance result glucose intolerance . It follow , , combination pregnancy corticosteroid could cause significant disruption glucose homeostasis . Routinely pregnancy , gestational diabetes diagnose administration glucose tolerance test consist ingestion 50g glucose follow serum glucose level one hour later . This known one-hour post-glucola test . A value 140 mg/dL consider abnormal , prompts administration 3-hour glucose tolerance test . This test consist fast blood sugar , follow serum glucose level 100g oral glucose challenge 1- , 2- 3-hours . A profile two abnormal value consider diagnostic gestational diabetes . In 1997 Fisher et al retrospectively compare incidence gestational diabetes patient receive tocolytics antenatal corticosteroid , find high incidence abnormal one-hour glucose screen test gestational diabetes patient receive steroid tocolytics ( medication use try decrease uterine contraction ) . However , interval receipt steroid administration glucose screen test quite variable study . Shelton et al 2002 evaluate extent hyperglycemia non-diabetic patient receive multiple weekly dos corticosteroid . They find fast glucose level increase several day follow first course steroid , return normal , remain persistently elevate patient receive three course . Postprandial level significantly alter . A study Gurbuz et al 2003 assessed effect betamethasone one-hour glucola test find although initial effect screen test , effect transient resolve generally one week administration second dose betamethasone . These patient one-hour screen test perform prior administration corticosteroid . The dose regimen betamethasone , however , different recommend ACOG . Thus far , study report : ( 1 ) significant hyperglycemia non-diabetic patient receive corticosteroid ( 2 ) magnitude pattern increase glucose differs patient normal abnormal one-hour glucolas diabetes . This study conduct pilot study , report extent hyperglycemia occur non-diabetic patient administration corticosteroid guide sample size calculation . We plan obtain thirty non-diabetic subject fifteen diet-controlled diabetic control comparison . The hypothesis patient diabetic extent hyperglycemia diabetic .</detailed_description>
