	<brief_summary>This clinical trial evaluate safety tolerability CRS 207 investigational product weaken form ( attenuate ) Listeria monocytogenes , type bacteria commonly find environment . CRS-207 alter lab reduce ability cause disease , maintain stimulation immune system . CRS 207 also genetically modify recombinant DNA release antigen call Mesothelin . Because CRS 207 stimulates immune response Mesothelin Mesothelin may present high level tumor cell normal cell , clinical trial also examine CRS 207 boost immune system way target certain type cancer . The purpose first clinical trial CRS-207 identify appropriate dose investigation agent later clinical study explore safety give consent adult advance cancer ovary pancreas , non-small cell lung cancer , advance malignant epithelial mesothelioma . Immunological response CRS-207 tumor status study participant also measure . Patients choose enter study must meet study entry criterion must previously fail standard treatment cancer . Qualifying study patient assign receive one several dose level CRS-207 . Each patient may receive 4 intravenous administration ( 21 day apart ) CRS-207 assign dose level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients consent participate study evaluate eligibility accord medical history , physical examination , blood testing , compute tomography ( CT ) scan thorax , abdomen , pelvis . Those patient qualify study receive 4 intravenous dos CRS-207 , 21 day apart . After infusion , monitor overnight in-patient facility , include collection blood specimen . Study participant return infusion outpatient follow-up visit blood test additional monitoring safety immune response CRS-207 . Participants repeat CT scan measure tumor size 2nd dose 4th dose . On Day 91 participant discharge study . All study participant eligible participate long-term follow-up study visit 6 month final dose CRS-207 annually thereafter evaluation disease progression , survival , potential long-term toxicity CRS 207 .</detailed_description>
