	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Profile Myfortic Combination With Tacrolimus Fed Versus Fasting State</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mycophenolate sodium ( Myfortic® ) antiproliferative immunosuppressant use renal transplantation . Mycophenolate sodium formulate enteric coated tablet release mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) turn inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) . Through inhibition IMPDH , de novo pathway purine synthesis , T B lymphocytes rely proliferation , block . The pharmacokinetic profile mycophenolate sodium mainly study combination cyclosporine steroid . There little information pharmacokinetics mycophenolate sodium combination tacrolimus currently publish information steroid withdrawal . All current publish data pharmacokinetics MPA patient receive chronic corticosteroid part immunosuppression regimen . As immunosuppression minimization , especially corticosteroid withdrawal , become popular important understand mycophenolate sodium metabolite behave two-drug maintenance immunosuppression regimen . The study assess pharmacokinetic profile mycophenolate sodium patient tacrolimus dose adjust base level , steroid withdrawal protocol . Renal transplant patient act control randomize crossover design pharmacokinetic profile occur two different time point . Immunosuppression consist induction therapy maintenance immunosuppression consist tacrolimus plus mycophenolate sodium . Corticosteroids withdrawn per institutional protocol within first week post transplant . Approximately 3-4 week post transplant , patient meet enrollment criterion consent participate study instruct take 720 milligram mycophenolate sodium orally twice daily one week either separate food two hour ( fast state ) meal ( fed state ) . After one week , patient admit approximately 24 hour continue receive mycophenolate sodium without food . During period , blood sample draw 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 12 hour follow dose evaluate level mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) mycophenolic acid glucuronide ( MPAG ) . After 24 hour , patient discharge instruction take mycophenolate sodium opposite manner ( feed fast state ) week . At end second week patient return second PK evaluation blood collection time point follow mycophenolate sodium dosing .</detailed_description>
