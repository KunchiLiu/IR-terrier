	<brief_summary>Deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) common complication hospitalize medical patient . Consensus guideline recommend use medication heparin low-molecular-weight heparin ( LMWH ) prevent DVT patient . Generally , medication give fix dose everyone . The appropriate dose medication patient severe obesity uncertain . There evidence use standard fixed-doses severely obese patient may provide adequate protection DVT . The purpose study evaluate weight-based dose ( 0.5 milligram per kilogram body weight ) commonly prescribe LMWH , enoxaparin severely obese patient determine predictable level blood thin achieve . We hypothesize dose enoxaparin 0.5mg/kg daily severely obese patient lead predictable blood level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Weight-based Enoxaparin Dosing Obese Medical Patients Risk DVT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Introduction : Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) significant cause morbidity mortality hospitalize patient . It well-known complication patient major surgery trauma . More recently , medically ill patient identify another high risk group 15 % patient experience VTE absence prophylaxis . 1 Several study find use enoxaparin , dalteparin , fondaparinux safe effective reduce risk VTE 45 % 63 % medically ill patient . 1-3 Additionally , enoxaparin find least safe effective unfractionated heparin VTE prophylaxis . 4 Enoxaparin 40 mg daily show safe effective prophylactic therapy hospitalize patient . 1 In thromboprophylaxis study , include investigate enoxaparin 40 mg daily , morbidly obese patient ( great equal 35 kg/m2 ) grossly under-enrolled . This problematic several reason . First , drug distribution weight dependent therefore , anticoagulant level differ accord patient 's weight . 5 Secondly , FDA approve dos fix dos take account body weight . Thirdly , obese patient great risk failure prevent VTE obese patient probably great risk develop VTE . 6 Lastly , morbidly obese patient become quite common population whole become obese . Even information , standard VTE prophylaxis obese patient . Optimal mean deliver safe effective thromboprophylaxis group unknown . When use LMWH 's , consensus recommendation monitor peak anti-Xa activity target level 0.1-0.2 units/mL . 5 However , many hospital access anti-Xa monitoring . Studies evaluate predictability weight-based prophylactic dosing tinzaparin demonstrate anti-Xa level predictably achieve therefore , laboratory monitoring may necessary dose strategy.7 However , tinzaparin widely utilized U.S. uncertainty remain whether predictable anti-Xa level achieve weight-based prophylactic regimen use commonly use drug enoxaparin . If weight-based dosing enoxaparin show result predictable anti-Xa activity obese patient , need monitor would obviate . Objectives : The primary objective evaluate predictability achieve target anti-Xa activity level morbidly obese medically ill patient use weight-adjusted ( 0.5 mg/kg ) daily prophylactic dose enoxaparin . The secondary objective gain information evaluate pharmacokinetic curve enoxaparin obese patient 18 hour second dose . Participant Selection Criteria : VTE risk evaluate institutionally utilized risk stratification scheme . This risk stratification scheme draft multi-disciplinary panel , represent standard care medically ill patient University Utah . Inclusion Criteria : Medically ill patient great 18 year age body mass index ( BMI ) great equal 35 kg/m2 admit University Utah Medical Center , risk VTE , eligible pharmacological prophylaxis determine patient 's provider consent study . Exclusion Criteria : Patients pregnant ( urine HCG perform female child-bearing age reliable birth control , otherwise clinically indicate ) , currently therapeutic anticoagulation , bleed disorder , platelet count less 100,000/mL , coagulopathy , active bleeding , creatinine clearance le 30 mL/min ( base Cockcroft-Gault equation , round serum creatinine 1 patient great 65 year ) , recent ( within 14 day ) stroke , surgery trauma exclude . Design : This single arm study enrol consecutive eligible patient admit University Utah Medical Center . This descriptive study evaluate feasibility predictability administer weight-adjusted enoxaparin ( 0.5mg/kg daily ) achieve recommend target peak anti-Xa level patient extreme body weight . The hypothesis weight-adjusted prophylaxis reliably achieve recommend target anti-Xa level . If , would obviate future need routine anti-Xa monitoring use pharmacologic regimen . Additionally , also parallel cohort evaluate day 2 pharmacokinetic curve 5-serial anti-Xa activity measurement subset 2-3 patient weight group . Study procedure : Consecutive eligible patient enrol informed consent give . Consent obtain University Hospital , mainly Internal Medicine Floor . It obtain one study co-investigators . At least one person obtain consent available consent patient time day adequate time exchange information answer question investigator participant . The study protocol use VTE prevention regimen employ rational pharmacologic principle line publish recommendation prophylaxis patient population . In consideration comparator cohort group , would consider unethical cohort group receive enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously daily comparator group pharmacologic data strongly suggest effective level anticoagulation would achieve population patient . 8 Informed consent felt optimal order allow patient fully understand regimen , although acceptable standard care , employ broad context study whereby patient data collect recorded prospective fashion . Once informed consent obtain , patient begin VTE prophylaxis enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg subcutaneously day . Peak anti-Xa activity obtain patient venipuncture 4-6 hour first second dose give . Five milliliter blood drawn . This amount blood need laboratory test perform . Baseline clinical demographic information obtain record standard case reporting form , CRF ( see Appendix B ) . Patients continue prophylaxis deem necessary attend physician duration hospital stay unless dictate otherwise patient 's attend physician . Adverse event VTE , bleed event , thrombocytopenia record hospital stay ( see Appendix C ) . If patient consent additional testing , mark consent form . These patient anti-Xa level draw first enoxaparin dose , 4h , 6h , 12h , 18h second dose enoxaparin . If 12h anti-Xa level obtain less 0.05 units/mL , 18 hour blood test eliminate . The purpose section provide u information evaluate pharmacokinetic curve enoxaparin obese patient 18 hour .</detailed_description>
