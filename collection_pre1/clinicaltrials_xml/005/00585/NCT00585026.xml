	<detailed_description>This research study design test utility D-shaped bifocal lens PRIO Computer Lenses person use computer . These different type eyeglass lenses commonly use perform computer work . D-shaped bifocal lens design general purpose use PRIO Computer Lenses progressive addition lens design use computer useful driving task require clear distance vision . The study examine much work subject complete 2-hr visit laboratory ( productivity ) subject feel work ( symptom ) . The UAB Department Optometry sponsor research study . Interested individual must least 40 year age relatively good vision eye wear glass least 4-hrs computer work per workday . There restriction enter study . Participating subject provide one two different type lenses choice eyeglass frame . All subject require use pair glass provide computer work period 4 month . During fourth eighth week period , subject require complete three short survey phone ( 10 question ) day five day ( morning , noon afternoon ) glass affect work computer feel . These survey take 5 minute less complete . During fifth sixth week , subject would require visit laboratory School Optometry 2-hours edit task computer complete short survey begin finish . Participants would call week confirm wear glass . These call would last 2-3 minute less . Upon qualify study , subject randomly ( like flip coin ) assign computer receive either bifocal lens variable focus computer glass . This single-blind study , mean neither doctor complete survey on-site visit inform type glass subject use . The following periodic measurement make study : visual upper extremity comfort ( survey ) productivity ( edit task ) . Subjects asked return clinic 1 2-hr visit . At visit subject ask experienced undesirable reaction tolerate glass .</detailed_description>
