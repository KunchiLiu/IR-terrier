	<criteria>Patients platinum refractory epithelial ovarian cancer : Defined patient histologically confirm epithelial ovarian cancer respond ( progressive stable disease best response ) initial chemotherapy regimen include platinum agent ( cisplatin carboplatin ) . Patients platinum resistant ovarian cancer : Defined patient histologically confirm epithelial ovarian cancer relapse less 6 month completion prior platinum base chemotherapy . If patient respond progressed 6 month complete therapy , patient must receive least one additional course platinum contain chemotherapy recur within 6 month discontinuation secondline treatment program . Measurable Disease : Lesions accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; /= 20 mm conventional technique . The method assessment technique use characterize identify report lesion baseline follow . Image base evaluation preferred evaluation clinical examination . Lesions consider unmeasurable include follow : bone lesion , leptomeningeal disease , ascites pleural/pericardial disease . Prior treatment number chemotherapeutic regimen permit long interval least 4 week since last chemotherapy . Prior treatment paclitaxel chemotherapy permit long administer &gt; /= 3 week regimen least 4 week since last treatment . Normal Hepatic function Total Bilirubin &lt; 2 time upper limit normal range . Transaminases &lt; 2 time upper limit normal range Nonpregnant nonnursing . Treatment protocol would expose unborn child significant risk . Women reproductive potential agree use effective mean birth control . Other serious illness , would limit survival &lt; 2 year , psychiatric condition , would prevent compliance treatment informed consent . Performance Status &gt; 2 Uncontrolled severe cardiovascular disease , diabetes , pulmonary disease , infection , opinion treat physician would make protocol treatment unreasonably hazardous patient . Patients `` currently active '' second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer . Patients consider `` currently active '' malignancy complete therapy consider physician less 30 % risk relapse within one year . Patients receive investigational agent within prior 4 week .
