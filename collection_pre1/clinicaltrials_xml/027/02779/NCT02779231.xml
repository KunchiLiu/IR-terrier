	<brief_summary>Hypertension remain one important preventable contributor disease death . It common risk factor stroke myocardial infarction U.S. , associate great attributable risk mortality among modifiable risk factor cardiovascular event . Over 50 million people live hypertension United States , hypertension one common reason visit healthcare provider . Abundant evidence randomize control trial show benefit antihypertensive drug treatment reduce important health outcome person hypertension . Yet , approximately 20 % U.S. adult unaware disease . Hypertension difficult diagnose common medical illness . In case , hypertension asymptomatic ; accordingly patient seek care common symptomatic illness . Patients frequently diagnose present end organ disease ( e.g. , myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , stroke , renal failure ) . Another complicate aspect relate diagnose uncontrolled hypertension multiple blood pressure measurement need establish diagnosis . Blood pressure reading falsely elevate clinic due presence observer clinical surrounding ( e.g. , white coat hypertension ) . Even elevate blood pressure read identify clinic setting , reading need order make possible physician decide next appropriate medical intervention . This need multiple BP measurement time often delay initiate modify medical therapy uncontrolled hypertension . Having patient take BP home facilitates timely diagnosis uncontrolled hypertension reduce diagnostic uncertainty . In fact , home measurement well diagnostic indicator stroke cardiovascular mortality clinic reading , closely correlate end-organ damage , cost effective well-tolerated patient . Patients frequently ask record BP clinic visit . Historically , patient use hand-written log , recently , patient instruct use Internet-based web portal uploads value patient 's electronic medical record . Compliance either approach relies effective patient provider followup , many setting , nurse pharmacist need call patient prompt blood pressure measurement , costly time consume approach . Therefore , researcher need develop effective , yet low cost alternative monitor home blood pressure . This study propose solution . The purpose study evaluate simple m-health intervention increase ease efficacy diagnose uncontrolled hypertension achieve good blood pressure control hypertensive patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Half participant randomize `` text-messaging '' protocol , half randomize `` standard care '' protocol . Text message protocol : A trained research personnel ( student , pharmacist , physician research assistant ) record patient 's cell phone number . Participants select 7 morning 7 evening time convenient check send blood pressure measurement . ( The literature recommend 12-14 measurement take one week morning evening reading make diagnosis hypertension ) . Participants use home blood pressure monitor provide give instruction use . This visit take around 30 minute . After participant leave clinic , pre-specified time date , automate server side script run investigator ' server check application database give time interval appropriate time send participant text message specific , simple instruction . An example message follow : `` Please remember check blood pressure morning 7am ! Reply message blood pressure time take . '' The participant return short text his/her blood pressure measurement time take : `` 150/90 145/88 7am '' . The investigator ' software identify cell phone number associate message enter blood pressure measurement , time blood pressure record , time message receive account associate participant secure database . If participant complete blood pressure homework assignment , pre-specified number reminder send patient 2 week elapse . Once pre-specified number measurement ( seven day ' worth measurement ) receive website , email alert send study personnel generate document blood pressure number send treat physician e.g . physician 's clinical mailbox . Standard care protocol : participant randomize `` Standard Care '' group instruct obtain 7 morning 7 evening blood pressure measurement . Participants ask choose method communication reply blood pressure number back physician . These include `` MyChart '' Internet-based web-portal connect participant 's electronic medical record , call back clinic number , mailing , fax blood pressure log physician . The type method participant choose record . Participants use home blood pressure monitor provide give instruction use . Participants group ask return blood pressure cuff Iowa River Landing Internal Medicine clinic . This do time convenient finish blood pressure assignment . During study , investigator access participant ' medical record obtain following information : late blood pressure measurement , blood pressure medication , late cholesterol measurement , cholesterol medication , late glucose measurement , chronic medical condition , medication , insurance , race , age , gender , marital status , height weight . Medical record also access 3-6 month later identify change medical management occur send blood pressure reading . Time type intervention record whether add new medication increase current medication dose . Also blood pressure reading next clinic visit ( 3-6 month study ) record .</detailed_description>
