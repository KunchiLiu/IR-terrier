	<brief_summary>Although RA pathomechanisms remain incompletely understood , periodontitis RA share pathogenic feature : genetic environmental influence , chronic inflammatory disease , immunoregulatory imbalance , bacterial factor , persistence antigen/peptide clinical factor ( conjunctive hard tissue destruction ) . Several hypothesis evocated : Gram negative bacterial systemic spreading , inflammatory transmitter substance systemic spreading ( IL1 , IL6 , IL17 , PGE2 ) , systemic spread bacterial degradation product ( LPS example ) . Currently Porphyromonas gingivalis ( PG ) might susceptibility factor RA PG enzyme , peptidylarginine deiminase lead auto antibody creation RA increase . As periodontitis , RA chronic disease cyclic increase evolution , need complex pluridisciplinary treatment approach . Recent study report increased prevalence RA patient periodontal disease . Others study show periodontal treatment induces significant decrease sedimentation rate DAS28 . Periodontitis suspect independent , aggravating factor patient RA ( give definition NIH : aggravate factor something make condition bad ) . So periodontal treatment consider RA treatment per se . But hypothesise treat periodontitis RA patient show sign periodontitis could result improvement RA disease activity . To date role periodontitis aggravate factor patient remain unclear , RCT design reasonably used test causal hypothesis . There still remain RA patient persistent symptom frequent exacerbation despite specialist care continuous treatment , result treat aggravate factor need . As majority patient benefit systematic evaluation treatment aggravate factor , periodontal treatment strategy need test . The aim randomise control trial ass effectiveness periodontal treatment rheumatoid arthritis patient . To assess effectiveness periodontal treatment reduce severity rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , patient suffer periodontitis rheumatoid arthritis . The hypothesis periodontal treatment reduce severity rheumatoid arthritis .</brief_summary>
