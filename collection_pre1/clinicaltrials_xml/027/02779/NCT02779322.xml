	<brief_summary>This study try identify difference cost , length operation result two different bariatric surgical technique , laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass Single anastomosis laparoscopic gastric bypass . The study conduct Spanish public health system hospital . The patient trial preoperative study , hospital treatment admission , postoperative treatment follow patient include hospital bariatric surgery program . No new method apply randomly choose surgical technique . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Versus Laparoscopic Single Anastomosis Gastric Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One group patient study do simplified laparoscopic gastric bypass , vertical gastric pouch 20 ml , 150 cm Roux-en-Y limb construct antegastric antecolic fashion , biliary limb 100 cm . Anastomosis do endoscopic surgical linear stapler , close aperture continuous absorbable running suture . The Petersen space mesenteric defect close non-absorbable suture . The group patient perform single anastomosis gastric bypass , also know Minigastric bypass ( MGB ) , vertical gastric pouch 100-150 ml , end side gastro-jejunal anastomosis 200 cm Treitz angle . The anastomosis do endoscopic surgical linear stapler , close aperture continuous absorbable run sutures.The Petersen space also close non-absorbable suture . The investigator randomly assign 10 patient group , n=20 . Considering one method basically , Roux-en-Y construction , expect clear difference operating room ( OR ) time , group . Fisher Test , use statistical analysis , assume risk 0.05 statistical power 90 % . Once patient include study , randomize 1:1 ratio conventional laparoscopic gastric bypass group single-anastomosis laparoscopic gastric bypass ( Mini gastric bypass ) group also blind surgeon surgery . The method randomization conceal envelope .</detailed_description>
