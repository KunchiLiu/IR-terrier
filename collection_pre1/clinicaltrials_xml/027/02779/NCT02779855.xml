	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine oncolytic virus call Talimogene laherparepvec ( modify herpes simplex 1 virus specifically destroy cancer cell leave normal cell alone ) inject directly tumor chemotherapy prior surgery enhance elimination triple negative breast cancer tumor . The natural herpes simplex 1 virus typically cause cold sore around mouth , talimogene laherparepvec version herpes virus change prevent reproduce normal tissue . However , still attack break open cancer tissue use treatment cancer . It think virus also help recruit participant 's immune system attack cancer cell treatment possibly destroy tumor tissue effectively chemotherapy alone . This virus already FDA approve treat melanoma skin tumor , investigator want determine virus achieve similar benefit woman triple negative breast tumor .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Must histologically cytologically confirm clinical stage T23 N02 triple negative ( estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor &lt; 1 % human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) 01 ImmunoHistoChemistry ( IHC ) unamplified fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) ) invasive ductal carcinoma . Must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . As well , participant must primary tumor able visualize ultrasound amenable direct injection . No prior history invasive breast cancer Adults age 1870 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 Must normal organ marrow function outline protocol Sexually active woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry duration study participation . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document T4 tumor , know metastatic disease , recurrent disease , inflammatory breast cancer , multicentric disease , and/or synchronous bilateral breast cancer A second active malignancy , exception localize nonmelanoma skin cancer prior situ carcinoma Receiving investigational agent unable treated doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition talimogene laherparepvec agent use study Known active prior herpes simplex virus infection ( HSV ) , prior complication HSV infection encephalitis , require systemic antiviral therapy time study enrollment Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , know active hepatitis B/C infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Women pregnant nursing Immunocompromised patient may increase risk herpetic infection treat talimogene laherparepvec . Therefore , HIVpositive patient , patient acquire congenital immunodeficiency condition , chronic systemic immunosuppressant ( require &gt; 10 mg prednisone equivalent/day ) , Those active autoimmune disease exclude study .</criteria>
