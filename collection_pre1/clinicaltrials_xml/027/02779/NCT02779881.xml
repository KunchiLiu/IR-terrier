	<brief_summary>Epigenetic mechanism implicate pathogenesis food allergy . The investigator previously demonstrate tolerance acquisition child Immunoglobulin E- ( IgE ) mediate cow 's milk allergy ( CMA ) drive epigenetic modulation Th1 Th2 cytokine gene . A regulatory T cell ( Treg ) suppressive phenotype , characterize stable expression transcription factor `` Forkhead box Protein 3 '' ( FoxP3 ) , play pivotal role food tolerance . FoxP3 mRNA expression lower child atopic asthma IgE-mediated food allergy healthy child . FoxP3 stable expression require full CpG demethylation transcriptional regulatory region , , moreover , hypermethylation FoxP3 gene associate reduced Treg function allergy . DNA methylation biologically chemically stable epigenetic modification lock long-term gene expression pattern . The demethylation status FoxP3 highly conserve region within Treg-specific-demethylated-region ( TSDR ) , CpG-rich , locate 2nd conserve non-coding sequence FoxP3 ( CNS2 ) , restrict Tregs . Transcriptional activity TSDR essentially determine methylation status : completely inactive methylated state , TSDR demethylated , transcription factor Ets-1 Creb bind TSDR . TSDR demethylated open chromatin conformation Foxp3 locus lead stable phenotype differentiate Foxp3+ Treg . FoxP3 TSDR demethylation peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) associate reduced atopic sensitization asthma child . Epigenetic regulation antigen-induced T-cell subset may predict state immune tolerance food allergy . Indeed , DNA methylation FoxP3 gene Tregs decrease oral tolerance acquisition patient peanut allergy undergoing oral immunotherapy . The aim study evaluate epigenetic regulation FoxP3 gene child IgE-mediated CMA .</brief_summary>
