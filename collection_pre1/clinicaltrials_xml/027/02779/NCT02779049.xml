	<detailed_description>Background : Nontuberculous mycobacteria Lung disease ( NTM-LD ) become important clinical concern , incidence increase last decade . Mycobacterium avium complex ( MAC ) common responsible specie NTM-LD Taiwan . The clinical relevance MAC sputum , however , 35~42 % exist environment ubiquitously . According guideline American Thoracic Society , diagnosis MAC-LD base clinical , radiographic , mycobacteriology criterion require two positive sputum culture MAC . The major limitation mycobacterial culture long turn-around-time , usually 2-4 week . In addition , mycobacterial culture nucleic acid amplification test discriminate true MAC infection colonization airway colonization MAC uncommon . Therefore , diagnosis MAC-LD remain big challenge clinical practice , rapid accurate diagnostic test develop . Beyond contemporary diagnostic criterion , host immune response NTM disease recently propose help diagnosis . Inflammatory marker may represent host response discriminate MAC infection colonization . But inflammatory marker influence infection MAC infection . By contrast , lymphocyte response antigen stimulation may specific diagnosis . In preliminary result , in-vitro response peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) low MAC-LD healthy control . The underlie mechanism responsible reduce PBMC response MAC-LD fully understand . In previous study conduct tuberculosis patient , interaction program cell death ligand-1 ( PD-L1 ) dendritic cell program cell death-1 ( PD-1 ) T cell lead apoptosis anergy T lymphocyte thus suppress cellular immunity . Therefore , possible similar alteration immune response also occur patient MAC-LD correlate PBMC response well disease severity .</detailed_description>
