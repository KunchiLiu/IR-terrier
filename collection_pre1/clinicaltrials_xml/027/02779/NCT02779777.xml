	<detailed_description>This phase 2 study investigate antitumor activity term RBC transfusion independence ( RBC TI ) tipifarnib approximately 58 eligible subject low , low INT risk MDS know curative treatment . Eligible subject may receive 2 prior systemic therapy . Prior systemic therapy receive standard dos least one full treatment cycle . A two-stage study design employ order minimize number study subject treat tipifarnib consider sufficiently efficacious grant development subject population . In first stage , 44 eligible subject enrol stratify one four biomarker-defined stratum ( 11 subject per stratum ) base subject KIR2DS2 KIR2DL2 positivity . Subjects receive tipifarnib administer start dose 900 mg , orally food , twice day ( bid ) 7 day alternate week ( Days 1-7 15-21 ) 28 day cycle . At discretion investigator , dose tipifarnib may increase 1200 mg bid subject experience dose limit toxicity 900 mg dose level . Subjects develop serious adverse event , ≥ grade 2 treatment-emergent adverse event ( TEAE ) deem related tipifarnib last ≥ 14 day undergo dose escalation . Stepwise 300 mg dose reduction control treatment-related , treatment-emergent toxicity also allow . In absence unmanageable toxicity , subject may continue receive tipifarnib treatment disease progression . If complete response observe , therapy tipifarnib maintain least 6 month beyond start response . Hematologic assessment , include peripheral blood evaluation review transfusion requirement , perform screen least monthly disease progression . Disease assessment ( bone marrow quality life evaluation ) also perform screen least every approximately 12 week start end cycle 3 . Additional hematologic disease assessment may conduct deem necessary Investigator . The timing hematologic disease assessment maintain much possible independently potential treatment cycle delay . Determination RBC TI disease response perform Investigator accord MDS/MPN International Working Group ( IWG ) criterion . Similarly , disease progression also determine base MDS/MPN IWG criterion . Upon disease progression , subject study follow approximately every 12 week survival use subsequent therapy either death 12 month accrual study complete , whichever occur first . Information survival subsequent anticancer therapy may collect phone . Subjects terminate treatment reason death disease progression assess regular interval disease progression leukemic transformation ( monthly blood count approximately every 12 week bone marrow aspirate symptom assessment ) . These assessment continue disease progression , withdrawal subject 's consent study procedure initiation another anticancer therapy</detailed_description>
