	<brief_title>Optimizing Walking Function Stroke Survivors Task-Oriented Home Exercise Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority stroke individual unable reenter previous community life stroke . Reintegration community life optimize walk function major goal stroke rehabilitation . Because widely available inpatient rehabilitation , discharge incomplete recovery , limited number technically trained physical therapist , financial saving , transportation difficulty , home-based stroke rehabilitation set interested many develop country . Task- orient exercise well know accept approach optimize walk function underlie principle motor control motor learn theory . This approach use clinical set close supervision , identification appropriate protocol community environment progress . To date , proper home exercise program base task-oriental principle minimal supervision improve walk competency stroke propose stroke rehabilitation . The purpose study investigate effect structure , progressive , task- orient home exercise program walking competency individual post stroke .</detailed_description>
