	<brief_title>Autologous Bone Marrow Transplantation Premature Ovarian Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Premature ovarian insufficiency ( POI ) curative treatment . It notice case POI recover spontaneously . Furthermore , concept fix prenatal pool oogonia challenge postnatal neo-oogenesis currently prove . Very small embryonic-like stem cell ( VSELs ) find ovary . VSELs stem cell notice survive chemotherapy induce gonadal insufficiency . Data animal study show stimulation stem cell result regeneration affect ovary . Stimulation achieve injection mesenchymal stem cell suppose secrete trophic factor . Numerous study mice prove efficacy bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) resume ovarian function chemotherapy-induced ovarian insufficiency . These study follow research human . Human study include use stem cell different site include BM , adipose tissue , umbilical cord . Allogeneic BMT raise moral conflict origin newly develop oocyte . Although study prove newly develop oocyte genetically trace recipient ; study show newly develop oocyte originate donor BM . Several small study examine use autologous BMT animal human . The result study promise . Use autologous BMT also avoid need chemotherapy condition related complication associate allogeneic BMT . Human study mostly use ovarian injection BM . Intravenous injection simpler less invasive ovarian injection later involve use laparoscopy . However , intravenous injection test .</detailed_description>
