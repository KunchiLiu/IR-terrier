	<brief_summary>SPI-1005 novel oral drug contain glutathione peroxidase mimetic ( ebselen ) test subject history NIHL risk additional NIHL . The goal multi-center Phase 2b study determine whether SPI-1005 effective reduce acute NIHL affect population . In Phase 2b study subject prior NIHL enrol expose calibrate sound challenge ( CSC ) induces slight acute NIHL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2b Study SPI-1005 Reduce Incidence , Severity , Duration Acute Noise Induced Hearing Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , safety efficacy study oral SPI-1005 adult Noise Induced Hearing Loss ( NIHL ) . All recruited subject severity NIHL determine start SPI-1005 treatment use otoscopy , tympanometry audiometry . Subjects &gt; 15 &lt; /= 40 decibel ( dB ) NIHL enrol randomize either placebo SPI-1005 . Patients dose either placebo SPI-1005 7 day , begin 1 day acute NIHL . Patients audiometry Words In Noise Testing ( WINT ) immediately calibrate sound challenge ( CSC ) . The CSC involve listen 4 hour pre-recorded music ( 100 dBA SPL ) insert earphone . The CSC induces slight acute NIHL . Follow-up audiometry WINT perform 1 7 day post-CSC . A total four clinic visit require 10-14 day .</detailed_description>
