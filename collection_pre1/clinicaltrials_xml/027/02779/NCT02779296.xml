	<brief_summary>Surgical Site Infections ( SSI ) represent significant complication plastic surgery . Infections result prolonged recovery impair long-term cosmetic appearance . One potential method reduce infection apply thin layer dermal glue suture site incision immediately surgery . Conventional closure , suture staple , leave site vulnerable epithelialization occur 24 48 hour . In contrast , dermal glue provide instant , waterproof barrier show intrinsic bacteriostatic property . The glue supply liquid enclose vial apply , polymerize rapidly exothermic reaction presence moisture form solid adhesive . 2-Octylcyanoacrylate ( 2-OCA ) -based glue formulate flexible previous preparation . The application dermal glue rapid , simple require specific follow-up naturally sloughs overtime . The purpose study determine 2-OCA-based glue reduce rate surgical site infection follow surgery . Patients undergo breast surgery recruit randomized either group receive layer glue suture follow surgery treatment . Patients follow 30 day 8 month sign infection , additional complication visual appearance scar . The cost treat infection calculate determine use dermal glue prevent infection economically feasible . This research potential find method reduce surgical site infection , applied surgery .</brief_summary>
