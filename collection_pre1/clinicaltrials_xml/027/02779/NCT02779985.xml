	<brief_summary>Effects food food substance energy expenditure particular interest , increase prevalence obesity consequent metabolic disease like type II diabetes fatty liver disease , risk factor development cardiovascular disease ( CVDs ) . Recently , Goji berry ( Lycium Barbarum , wolfberry ) introduce Western diet . L. Barbarum originate Asia , use improve health several organ . Although L. Barbarum promote super food many beneficial effect , consistent scientific evidence effect lack . In one study , find short-term intake L. Barbarum polysaccharides - equal 150 g fresh berry - increase postprandial oxygen consumption . This indicate L. Barbarum might exert beneficial effect energy expenditure . Furthermore , long-term intervention trial show beneficial effect L. Barbarum lipid glucose metabolism mouse type II diabetic patient inflammatory status healthy elderly . Altogether , L. Barbarum potential use functional food increase metabolic health , detail information postprandial effect L. Barbarum miss . We therefore propose double-blinded , randomize , placebo control intervention trial investigate effect single dose L. Barbarum postprandial energy expenditure substrate oxidation , metabolic flexibility , lipid glucose metabolism inflammatory marker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Goji Berries Energy Expenditure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : The primary objective study investigate effect single dose L. Barbarum postprandial energy expenditure . Secondary objective investigate effect single dose L. Barbarum postprandial lipid carbohydrate oxidation metabolic flexibility , postprandial lipid glucose metabolism inflammatory marker . Study design : This double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled intervention trial two test day separate washout period least 1 week . Study population : The study population consist 20 apparently healthy overweight ( BMI 25 30 kg/m2 ) men age 18-65 year . Intervention : All subject receive mixed meal include 25 gram dry L. Barbarum intervention product match mixed meal without L. Barbarum placebo product . The meal match energy content macronutrient composition .</detailed_description>
