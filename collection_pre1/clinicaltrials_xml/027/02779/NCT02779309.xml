	<detailed_description>ABSTRACT Introduction : Older adult live community often multiple , chronic condition functional impairment . A challenge healthcare provider work community lack predictive tool apply broad spectrum mortality risk observe may use inform care planning . Objective : To develop mortality risk prediction model old adult home care set . The final algorithm implement web-based calculator use old adult need care , well informal formal caregiver . Design : Open cohort study use Resident Assessment Instrument Home Care ( RAI-HC ) data Ontario , Canada , January 1 , 2007 , December 31 , 2013 . Participants : The derivation cohort consist approximately 437 000 home care recipient January 1 , 2007 , December 31 , 2012 . A split sample validation cohort include approximately 122 000 recipient January 1 December 31 , 2013 . Main outcome measure : Predicted survival time RAI-HC assessment . All death ( N â‰ˆ 245 000 ) ascertain linkage provincial vital statistic record . Statistical analysis : Proportional hazard regression estimate assessment assumption . Predictors include sociodemographic characteristic , social support , health condition , functional status , cognition , symptom decline , prior healthcare use . Model performance evaluate 6- 12-month predicted risk , include measure calibration ( e.g. , calibration plot ) discrimination ( e.g. , c-statistics ) . The final algorithm generate combine development validation data .</detailed_description>
