Therefore aim project deconstruct SCH symptom monitor management system determine relative contribution cost component achieve symptom reduction , maintain general health function reduce healthcare utilization . We also examine benefit least individual component overall system . A 5 group randomize control trial design utilize 750 participant ( 150/group ) begin new course chemotherapy call SCH system daily report presence severity 11 symptom throughout course chemotherapy 6 month . This study significant innovative shift current clinical practice paradigm provide symptom care episodically clinic visit innovative approach patient-centric , provide symptom care patient need . The study address question generally ask multi-component intervention , determine active ingredient cost . Determining value new approach care automate telehealth intervention essential decision process healthcare system payer decide adopt reimburse . It also vitally important patient new symptom care innovation adopt good meet need dramatically reduce symptom .</detailed_description>
