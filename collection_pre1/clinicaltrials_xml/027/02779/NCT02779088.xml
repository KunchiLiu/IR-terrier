	<detailed_description>It easy perform longitudinal cohort study urban area high migration . WanHwa area , sit southwestern Taipei , property high elder population low migration , suitable cohort study . In age process , elderly decrease functional status result frailty , immobility , poor health-related fitness . Health-related fitness include cardiovascular endurance , body composition , muscular strength endurance , flexibility . It strong relationship good health , characterize ability perform daily activity . The functional status old citizen decline age . Appropriate physical activity reverse process deconditioning related disease . The screen old citizen health-related fitness select high risk population . However , report health-related fitness scarce Taiwan . The aim study establish cohort elder population base parameter health-related fitness , body composition , blood biochemistry , balance , quality life , musculoskeletal ultrasonography ; evaluate association fitness parameter disease incidence data . Investigators expect recruit 1200 adult attend annual health check-up National Taiwan University , BeiHu Branch 2016 2017 , train sarcopenia strengthening exercise . This cohort study establish urban elderly cohort , measure physical functional parameter , find risk factor age , validate role strength train sarcopenic patient .
