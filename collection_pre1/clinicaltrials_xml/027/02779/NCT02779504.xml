	<brief_summary>The Agluna® ( antimicrobial ionic silver surface technology ) use treat surface METS ( Modular Endoprosthetic Tumour System ) medical device , order reduce risk post surgical infection orthopaedic endoprosthetic replacement surgery . This Post Market Clinical Follow study design retrospectively establish infection rate cohort patient receive Agluna® Treated METS implant compare clinical data patient receive untreated METS implant; order provide evidence support investigator ' clinical claim .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post Market Clinical Follow Up Study Evaluation Agluna® METS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This post-market clinical follow-up study retrospective data comparison study series Agluna® treat untreated METS™ modular prosthesis conduct Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital , Stanmore . The expected sample size 106 , 53 patient treatment arm ( Agluna® treat vs untreated ) . However initial pilot 20 subject evaluate feasibility study conduct identify study design modification require . The primary outcome estimation infection rate 12 month follow Agluna ( silver ) treat METS™ endoprosthetic surgery . This compare infection rate non-Agluna Treated device similar population . Incidence infection measure accord accept definition periprosthetic joint infection American Academy Orthopedic Surgeons . The study follow period 12 month implantation . Secondary objective examine health economic impact use Agluna® Treated METS™ Modular Tumour System comparison untreated METS™ Modular Tumour System establish clinically relevant superiority Agluna® Treated METS™ Modular Tumour System comparison untreated METS™ Modular Tumour System .</detailed_description>
