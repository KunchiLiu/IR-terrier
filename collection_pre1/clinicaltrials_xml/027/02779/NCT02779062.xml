	<detailed_description>An apparent life-threatening event ( ALTE ) refers sudden occurrence infant symptom breathe irregularity , stiffness , limpness , appear frighten caretaker , prompt seek medical care . ALTE first define 1986 NIH consensus panel . Population-based epidemiologic study report range 2.5 9.4 ALTE admission per 1000 live birth . While ALTEs truly life-threatening , clinician parent may assume infant 's life was—and may still be—in danger proven otherwise . Since actual risk adverse outcome well-appearing ALTE patient unknown , concern often lead extensive diagnostic evaluation hospitalization rule serious occult pathology even patient appear well presentation unremarkable clinical assessment . Nonspecific inpatient diagnostic evaluation harm patient cause complication invasive testing , false-positive test result , vulnerable child syndrome . Given risk low probability test identify treatable diagnosis well-appearing infant , American Academy Pediatrics establish Guideline Committee ALTEs develop recommendation management patient . Specifically , Committee formulate criterion define low-risk group infant present ALTE may safely discharge minimal diagnostic testing hour observation . While evidence-based clinical guideline potential reduce unnecessary test hospital admission , anecdotal evidence suggest parent may frighten event resist return home baby even objective risk extremely small . To gather data parental attitude , investigator propose survey subject ( parent infant experience ALTE ) learn whether would accept return home brief period observation emergency department physician determine safe . This survey focus subject 's willingness forgo admission hospital risk associate hospitalization ( e.g. , hospital-acquired infection , complication invasive diagnostic procedure ) might outweigh risk recurrent ALTE serious underlying condition . Subject 's obvious need admission base initial clinical assessment exclude , since discharge home would option . Study finding inform effort develop clinical guideline management ALTE take account parental attitude objective evidence . Without type data , implementation guideline problematic .</detailed_description>
