	<brief_summary>To assess safety biological efficacy therapeutically administer closely HLA-matched third party donor-derived specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) target cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) Adenovirus ( Adv ) Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) fungi include Aspergillus Candida species treatment viral infection follow allogeneic blood marrow stem cell solid organ transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Partially HLA-matched Third Party Antigen Specific T-cells Infection Post-stem Cell Solid Organ Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study analyse safety biological efficacy administer investigational product ( closely HLA-matched third party donor-derived T cell stimulate viral fungal antigen express DC ) , treatment viral reactivation and/or infection fungal infection follow allogeneic blood marrow solid organ transplantation . The cell give therapeutically transplantation patient active viral reactivation proven/probably fungal infection despite standard therapy . Our AIMS study safety third party donor-derived CTL infusion , effect treatment viral reactivation well effect reconstitution virus- fungus-specific immunity , viral fungal infection reactivation rate transplantation , viral load , use antiviral antifungal pharmacotherapy . We evaluate safety infusion respect development adverse event within first 12 month post-CTL infusion dynamic cell persistence T-cell chimerism analysis .</detailed_description>
