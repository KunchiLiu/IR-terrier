	<detailed_description>There currently two different genetic test develop purpose . They look specific DNA component determine risk . Participants study age 60 year caucasian population people test validate . Each participant study explain ask sign inform consent document agree participate . They dilate exam eye along photograph take retina . If doctor see necessary also special scan special angiogram eye look retina detail . For genetic test member research team use two swab genetic company gently scrap cell inside cheek . These cell send respective lab analysis .</detailed_description>
