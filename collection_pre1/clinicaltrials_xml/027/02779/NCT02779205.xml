	<brief_summary>The beneficial effect relate administration adipose tissue-derived stromal cell ( ADSC ) demonstrate various situation physiological pathological wound healing , thus open new field cell therapy . Despite use new technology , management burn child well congenital malformation hypospadias cleave lip and/ cleft palate lead aesthetic functional sequela require multiple surgical procedure . Cell therapy base administration ADSC seem promising issue indication , however , date study conduct ADSC pediatric population . An initial study ( Protocol 0808203 ) allow u obtain first sample adipose tissue child conduct vitro comparative study characterization property ADSC child compare adult . In continuity , second study aim complete knowledge efficacy safety child ADSC cell therapy assess animal model skin wound heal develop lab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Through study , medium term objective approach clinical protocol treatment pathological scar develop appropriate way deliver ADSC future clinical application , ensure safety procedure . The primary goal work determine whether ADSC child prepare accord Good Manufacturing Practice ( GMP ) , associate improvement wound heal vivo demonstrate adult ADSC . To answer question , 40 sample adipose tissue child obtain settle surgery ( inguinal hernia vesico-ureteral reflux suprapubic way ) perform within 2 group child ; 0 1 year 2 13 year , define data acquire previous protocol . Wound heal evaluate nude mouse model skin burn . A macroscopic analysis carry two index describe literature ( re-epithelialization scar contraction ) express percentage initial lesion different time ( 3 day , 7 day , 10 day , 14 day , 21 day , 30 day ) . A microscopic analysis conduct determine rate re-epithelialization ( day 7 ) evolution skin structural parameter ( dermal epidermal thickness , density collagen , inflammatory infiltration ) . These index define treat group ( burn mice inject pediatric ADSC ) control mouse ( burn inject cell ) . A comparative analysis two group age conduct also compare data collect adult ADSC . To answer second part primary goal regard safety , perform long-term follow-up ( 1 yr ) burn mice inject ADSC , obtain data animal transplantation cell clinical study . Complementary vitro investigation still seem necessary well understand specificity ADSC pediatric origin particularly perform transcriptomic epigenetic study .</detailed_description>
