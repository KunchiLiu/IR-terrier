	<detailed_description>Previous large study conclude rest LV diastolic systolic function decline age . The cardiovascular system undergoes several age-related change . For healthy old individual , heart generally function well rest condition . Structural physiological change tend result diminish exercise tolerance . However , increasingly show even change result sedentary lifestyle age-related phenomenon . Most elderly people tend become less physically active . It difficult separate change intrinsic age process arise result sedentary lifestyle . Studies age physical activity usually compare old athlete sedentary one , physical activity find attenuate impact age heart . Thus , investigator set find difference heart elderly physically fit measure METS . And try understand basis difference .</detailed_description>
