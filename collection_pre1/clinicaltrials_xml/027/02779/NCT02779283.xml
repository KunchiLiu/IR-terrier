	<brief_summary>This phase IB trial study feasibility use functional laboratory base study determine well test use select personalized kinase inhibitor therapy combination standard chemotherapy treat patient newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . It also evaluate safety potential efficacy . Kinase inhibitor type substance block enzyme call kinase . Human cell many different kinase enzyme , help control important cell function . Certain kinases active type cancer cell block may help keep cancer cell grow . Testing sample blood patient AML laboratory kinase inhibitor may help determine kinase inhibitor activity cancer cell one combine standard care chemotherapy . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving personalized kinase inhibitor therapy combine standard chemotherapy may better treatment AML .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Personalized Kinase Inhibitor Therapy Combined With Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine feasibility use vitro small molecule inhibitor screen select kinase inhibitor add standard chemotherapy induction AML . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety tolerability addition kinase inhibitor add standard induction chemotherapy . II . Evaluate overall objective response rate completion induction therapy . III . Evaluate need re-induction day 14 ( Â±3 day ) . IV . Evaluate sensitivity kinase inhibitor use investigational small molecular inhibitor screen newly diagnose AML . V. Determine twelve-month overall survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Perform next-generation mutational analysis primary leukemia sample study subject baseline establish panel know mutation subject time bone marrow recovery induction chemotherapy measure residual disease evaluate utility next-generation sequence method compare flow cytometry minimal residual disease ( MRD ) . II . Evaluate pharmacokinetics individual kinase inhibitor . III . Determine cytogenetic risk group high rate treatment failure inability obtain result small molecule inhibitor screen . OUTLINE : Patients receive cytarabine intravenously ( IV ) continuously 24 hour day 1-7 , idarubicin IV 30 minute day 1-3 . Based result kinase inhibitor assay , patient receive either sorafenib tosylate PO twice daily ( BID ) , sunitinib malate PO daily , dasatinib PO daily , nilotinib PO daily , ponatinib hydrochloride PO daily day 8-29 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-6 week , minimum 1 year .</detailed_description>
