	<detailed_description>Background : Liquid meal replacement ( LMRs ) provide mixture carbohydrate , fat protein , along added vitamin mineral liquid ready-to-drink form powder formula require mixing . They design mimic low-calorie meal serve quick easy source calorie consume . Behavioral strategy tool important assist obese individual lose weight maintain weight loss . There evidence LMRs contribute weight loss may reduce relate cardiometabolic risk factor . Need propose research : An early meta-analysis demonstrate partial meal replacement plan produce significant weight loss improve weight-related cardiometabolic risk factor . Several control trial since investigated effect liquid meal replacement body weight weight-related risk factor disease . There need update evidence effect LMRs cardiometabolic risk inform dietary guideline public health policy development . Objective : To synthesize evidence randomize controlled trial effect LMRs body weight , blood pressure , glycemic control establish lipid target . Design : The systematic review meta-analysis conduct accord Cochrane Handbook Systematic Reviews Interventions report accord Preferred Reporting Items Systematic Reviews Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) . Data source : MEDLINE , EMBASE The Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials ( Clinical Trials ; CENTRAL ) search use appropriate search term supplement manual search . Study selection : The investigator include randomize controlled trial &gt; = 2-weeks duration ass effect LMRs versus control diet body weight , blood pressure , marker glycemic control lipid profile . Data extraction : Two investigator independently extract relevant data ass risk bias use Cochrane Risk Bias Tool . All disagreement resolve consensus . Standard computation imputation use derive miss variance data . Outcomes : Four set outcomes assess : ( 1 ) Markers adiposity ( body weight , BMI , body fat , waist circumference ) , ( 2 ) glycemic control ( HbA1c , fast glucose , fast insulin ) , ( 3 ) Established therapeutic lipid target ( LDL-cholesterol , non-HDL-cholesterol , apolipoprotein B , HDL-cholesterol , triglyceride ) , ( 4 ) blood pressure ( systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure ) . Data synthesis : Pooled analysis mean difference perform use generic inverse variance method . Random-effects model use even absence statistically significant between-study heterogeneity yield conservative summary effect estimate presence residual heterogeneity . Fixed-effects model use less 5 included trial . Crossover trial assess via paired analysis . Heterogeneity assess Cochran Q statistic quantify I2 statistic . To explore source heterogeneity , investigator conduct sensitivity analysis , study systematically remove . If &gt; = 10 trial , study investigator conduct apriori subgroup analyse liquid meal replacement type ( diabetes-specific formula , soy-based formula fiber-containing formula ) , age , health status ( presence/absence type 2 diabetes ) , comparator , dose , baseline measurement , study design ( parallel , crossover ) , follow-up ( &lt; = 3 month , &gt; 3 month ) risk bias . Meta-regression analysis assess significance categorical continuous subgroup analysis . When &gt; = 10 trial available , publication bias investigate funnel plot formal test use Egger Begg test . If publication bias suspect , investigator attempt adjust funnel plot asymmetry impute miss study data use Duval Tweedie trim fill method . Evidence assessment : The strength evidence outcome assess use Grading Recommendations Assessment , Development Evaluation ( GRADE ) . Knowledge translation plan : The result disseminate interactive presentation local , national international scientific meeting publication high impact factor journal . Target audience include public health scientific community interest nutrition obesity . Feedback incorporate use improve public health message key area future research define . Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers network among opinion leader increase awareness participate directly committee member development future guideline . Significance : The propose research synthesize high quality evidence randomize trial aid knowledge translation effect LMRs body weight related cardiometabolic disease risk . It strengthen evidence-base guideline , improve health outcome , educate healthcare provider patient , stimulate industry innovation , guide future research design .</detailed_description>
