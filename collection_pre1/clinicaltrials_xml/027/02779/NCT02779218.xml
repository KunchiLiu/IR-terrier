	<brief_summary>Strokes represent , industrialize country lead cause acquire motor disability adult old 40 . Stroke responsible France 150 000 200 000 new case hemiplegia year . These patient see deficit improve first 6 month stroke . This recovery largely base brain plasticity mechanism rehabilitation main objective optimize mechanism . However , 20 % patient hospitalize rehabilitation sector recover functional upper limb . This lack functionality due overall strength gap also predominance gap extension movement wrist finger . Meanwhile , work brain plasticity help develop new technique non-invasive brain stimulation ( Non-invasive Brain Stimulation , NIBS ) model couple stimulation ( Paired Associative Stimulation , PAS ) modulate way effective brain plasticity . In previous study , investigator show 30 minute session last facilitation ( 60mn ) specific motor evoke potential ( MEP ) Extensor Carpi Radialis ( ECR ) . Several study show adjuvant effect GSIN associate learn motor task . For PAS , study show great facilitation latter associate muscle contraction . The motor imagery ( MI ) imagine movement without realize , base mechanism similar real movement . This technique also show effect adjuvant therapy hemiplegic patient , however , remain low obtain motor drive . Its use patient motor make uniqueness strength .</brief_summary>
