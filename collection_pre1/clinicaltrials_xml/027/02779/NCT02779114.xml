	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) characterize progressive synovitis lead degradation articular cartilage lead erosion juxtaarticular bone drive auto antibody . Few clinical study could show quick thorough control inflammatory process could stop degradation process [ 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 ] presumably well prognosis remission untreated and/or uncontrolled RA disease [ 20 ] . These study aim low disease activity [ 20 ] , often focus early RA [ 18 , 19 ] , evaluate different therapy strategy , mostly escalate instead deescalating medication [ 20 , 21 ] . Real `` RA- - remission '' therapy reduction study miss , even first small trial focus one preparation show promising result [ 16 , 17 ] . In study conventional medication usual combination evaluate treatment Rheumatoid Arthritis different stage disease duration . The study schedule 365-day ( 12-months ) , phase 3 multicenter , randomize , open , prospective , control , parallel-group intervention study 318 patient Rheumatoid Arthritis . Based result clinical study mention , need guideline therapy proposal RA- patient remission current preparation evaluate subject control set clinical study . The information obtain study assess formulation new guideline regard patient Rheumatoid Arthritis remission .</detailed_description>
