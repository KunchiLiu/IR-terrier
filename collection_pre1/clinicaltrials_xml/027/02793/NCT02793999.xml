The researcher use investigational system device non-invasively ( , , without penetrate skin ) , measure amount oxygen go use brain . They take bedside research measurement baby ' stay hospital . With measurement , intention study role oxygen brain injury test efficacy research device potential permanent bedside diagnostic device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perinatal Brain Injury : Potential Innovative NIRS Optimize Hypothermia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonatal encephalopathy ( NE ) due hypoxia-ischemia major public health concern occur 6/1000 live term birth devastate consequence . Many affected neonate suffer lifelong motor disability epilepsy , increasingly high prevalence cognitive behavioral disability become appreciate . In hypoxia-ischemia decrease blood oxygen delivery , follow reperfusion transient energy recovery . What follow `` window opportunity '' excitotoxicity associate increased cerebral metabolism eventually lead secondary energy failure irreversible cell death . In window , therapeutic hypothermia ( TH ) currently treatment available proven efficacy . TH act primarily decrease cerebral metabolism , thus preserve energy store . Although current gold standard brain injury detection magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , MRI impractical screen tool provide bedside monitoring optimize individual response therapy . Commercially available continuous wave ( CW ) near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) system provide bedside measure cerebral oxygen saturation ( SO2 ) SO2 alone assess oxygen metabolism , oxygen delivery take account . What need bedside tool monitor cerebral metabolism detect elevation metabolism suggest evolve hypoxic-ischemic injury , decrease metabolism suggest response therapy . Cerebral oxygen consumption ( CMRO2 ) direct measure cerebral metabolism therefore investigator propose measure index CMRO2 bedside use innovative combination Frequency Domain Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ( FDNIRS ) Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy ( DCS ) . The initial study investigator show CMRO2 elevate neonate MRI evidence perinatal brain injury , confirm neonates TH significantly low CMRO2 normal control . Following exciting result , propose feasibility study determine FDNIRS-DCS screen involvement , assess response treatment , predict outcomes one large neonatal population require early screening immediate intervention : neonatal encephalopathy . To assess early outcome , research team propose innovative combination advance neurobehavioral testing , regional FDNIRS-DCS measure quantitative MRI analysis use MRIs obtain without sedation . If hypothesis prove true , help determine bedside index CMRO2 provide FDNIRS-DCS optimize TH individual neonate , thereby improve neurodevelopmental outcome . Success stage also allow exploration potential FDNIRS-DCS determine additional benefit emerge new treatment NE screen treatable neonatal disorder .</detailed_description>
