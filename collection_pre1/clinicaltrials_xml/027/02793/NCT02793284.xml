	<brief_summary>The investigator attempt determine new form imaging call 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT helpful physician decide manage suspect prostate cancer recurrence . This imaging use Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography ( PET/CT ) scan use radioactive tracer 18F-DCFPyL concentrated prostate cancer cell potentially identify cancer cell throughout body . The combination 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT potentially identify area prostate cancer recurrence see usual image [ bone scan , compute tomography ( CT ) thorax , abdomen pelvis , plus multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ] .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study evaluate utility investigational restaging 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT follow conventional imaging ( bone scan , CT thorax , abdomen pelvis plus multi-parametric pelvic MRI ) detect prevalence metastatic disease among men biochemical recurrence radical radiotherapy treatment prostate . Men treat primary radiation external beam brachytherapy eligible . Eighty ( 80 ) eligible consent patient biochemical recurrence potentially suitable local salvage target ablative therapy register imaged conventional imaging ( bone scan , CT thorax , abdomen pelvis plus multi-parametric pelvic MRI ) follow investigational restaging 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT . Characterizing site disease identify combination 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT conventional image versus 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT alone use explore potential 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT single restaging study men biochemical recurrence . While investigation treatment restaging discretion investigator patient , actual treatment/management , treatment outcome quality life record electronic database 6 , 12 , 24 36 month re-staging . Such longitudinal analysis management outcomes useful characterize disease trajectory , response treatment quality life patient whose recurrent disease manage base comprehensive restaging use combination conventional image 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT .</detailed_description>
