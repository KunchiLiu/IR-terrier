	<brief_title>Clinical Trial In Healthy Volunteers And Health Elderly Volunteers To Evaluate The Safety , Tolerability And Blood Concentration After Single And Multiple Escalating Oral Doses Of PF-06751979 .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics ( PK ) PF-06751979 follow oral dos healthy adult healthy elderly subject higher dose previously administer . Such characteristic enable design future clinical trial patient population , effort optimize efficacy PF-06751979 , well establish safety margin human . Inclusion healthy elderly subject optional , provide additional safety tolerability information age range target population confirm PK PF-06751979 subject future clinical trial Alzheimer 's disease patient population . The Primary Objective evaluate safety tolerability single multiple ascend oral dos PF-06751979 healthy adult subject . Secondary Objectives characterize pharmacokinetics PF-06751979 : plasma follow single multiple ascend oral dose administration healthy adult subject urine follow multiple ascend oral dose administration healthy adult subject . An additional secondary objective evaluate effect multiple oral dos PF 06751979 CSF A-beta fragment healthy adult subject . This study divide three part : Part A - Single ascending dos ( SAD ) healthy adult subject ( 18-55 year ) ; Part B - Multiple ascending dos ( MAD ) healthy adult subject ( 18-55 year ) ; Part C - Multiple dos ( MD ) healthy elderly subject ( 60-85 year ) . Study Parts may run staggered fashion ; Part C study may commence satisfactory review relevant data Parts A B .</detailed_description>
