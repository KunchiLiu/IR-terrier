	<criteria>Baseline : 1 . Is ≥ 18 year old legal consent . 2 . Is willing comply followup evaluation specify time . 3 . Subject subject 's legal representative inform understands nature study provide sign informed consent participate study . 4 . Has Rutherford Clinical Category Score 2 , 3 4 ( index limb ) . 5 . Resting ABI &lt; 0.9 , abnormal exercise ABI . Intraprocedure : 6 . De novo , restenotic , and/or occlusive target lesion ( ) locate within native common and/or external iliac artery : proximal point distal ostium common iliac artery distal point least 1 cm Inferior Epigastric Artery ( IEA ) measure straight anteroposterior ( AP ) view . 7 . Radiographic evidence ≥ 50 % stenosis restenosis ( PTA adjunct therapy , include stent stent graft ) , occlusion target lesion ( ) common iliac artery and/or external iliac artery . 8 . Total combined length lesion ( ) ≤ 120 mm determine investigator amenable stenting . 9 . Reference vessel diameter ≥ 4.0 mm ≤ 9.0 mm . 10 . Radiographic evidence target limb straight line femoropopliteal flow , either require CFA/SFA/popliteal treatment significant stenosis ( ≥ 50 % stenosis occlusion , confirm angiography index procedure ) , OR undergone successful treatment accord protocol specification &lt; 30 % residual stenosis procedural complication prior enrollment study . 11 . At least one patent infrapopliteal artery ankle require intervention ( i.e. , &lt; 50 % stenosis ) . 1 . Has previous stent stentgraft implantation target lesion ( ) . 2 . Has contraindication know untreatable allergy antiplatelet therapy , anticoagulant , thrombolytic drug drug use study accord protocol . 3 . Has know hypersensitivity contrast material adequately pretreated . 4 . Has know hypersensitivity nickeltitanium ( nitinol ) . 5 . In opinion investigator , bleed diathesis , coagulopathy , and/or know hypercoagulable condition make patient unsuitable study participation . 6 . Refuses blood transfusion . 7 . Is female currently breastfeed , pregnant , childbearing potential use adequate contraceptive measure refuse use contraception throughout duration study . 8 . Has life expectancy le 1 year . 9 . Has plan use thrombectomy , atherectomy , brachytherapy , cryotherapy laser device treat common and/or external iliac artery index procedure . 10 . Has plan surgical intervention ( require inpatient hospitalization ) 14 day 30 day index procedure . 11 . Is currently participate investigational drug device study yet reach primary endpoint analysis . 12 . Has know aortic disease require intervention within 9 month post index procedure . 13 . In opinion investigator , one follow comorbid condition may impact subject safety and/or participation study : History severe liver disease ( i.e . ascites , esophageal varix , liver transplant ) Known suspect active systemic infection infection within target limb Undergoing immunosuppressant therapy follow organ transplant Chronic Kidney Disease Stage IIIB worse ( i.e. , GFR &lt; 45 mL/min ) New York Heart Association Classification III IV hospitalization decompensated heart failure within 30 day index procedure Recent ( within 30 day index procedure ) myocardial infarction Recent ( within 30 day index procedure ) hemorrhagic ischemic stroke Acute thrombophlebitis deep venous thrombosis index limb treat Any comorbid condition judgment investigator precludes safe percutaneous intervention 14 . Guide wire successfully cross target lesion ( ) reenter true vessel lumen beyond lesion ( ) , study device deploy proximal distal end within true vessel lumen . * 15 . Aneurysmal target vessel . * 16 . Presence acute intraluminal thrombus propose lesion site ( ) . * 17 . If treatment require nontarget lesion distal target vessel index procedure , nontarget lesion must successfully treat ( residual stenosis &lt; 30 % procedural complication ) prior treatment target lesion : Be locate within native CFA/SFA/PPA The distal point must least 1 cm first branch tibial trifurcation 18 . Lack straightline blood flow foot/ankle target limb prior index procedure inability achieve straightline blood flow foot/ankle target limb treatment nontarget lesion CFA/SFA/proximal popliteal index procedure prior enrollment . * 19 . Perforation , flowlimiting dissection , injury require additional stenting surgical intervention prior start target lesion treatment . *</criteria>
