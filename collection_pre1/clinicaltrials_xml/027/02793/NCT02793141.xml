	<brief_title>International Study NoSocomial Pneumonia Intensive CaRE ( PneumoINSPIRE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specifically , study aim : - Evaluate global epidemiology nosocomial pneumonia ICU patient , analyse responsible pathogen resistance pattern type pneumonia geographical region . - Describe global scale current clinical practice regard diagnosis determine degree concordance diagnosis nosocomial pneumonia routine clinical practice official definition include : ) ATS/IDSA 2005 guideline ; b ) CDC/NHSN Surveillance Definitions ( version January 2015 , modify April 2015 ) . - Identify global scale variable treatment decision emphasis therapeutic schema , appropriateness , de-escalation decision relation outcomes . Secondary objective include : - Evaluate nosocomial pneumonia specific subgroup critically ill patient ( , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ COPD ] , elderly , postoperative , trauma patient ) . - Describe difference nosocomial pneumonia non-intubated ICU patient VAP . - Compare characteristic outcomes patient nosocomial pneumonia ward patient later transfer ICU non-intubated ICU patient nosocomial pneumonia . This international study explore clinical detail nosocomial pneumonia ICU setting : practice variation among country continent , diagnostic treatment modality , implicate pathogen resistance pattern , resolution pattern risk factor unfavourable outcome . In view , global multicentre study shall provide useful information elaboration future recommendation diagnostic treatment approach nosocomial pneumonia ICU . Inclusion criterion : ICU patient diagnosis nosocomial pneumonia , include : - Admission ICU diagnosis HAP develop ward non-intubated patient ( Ward HAP ) - The first episode ICU-acquired pneumonia develop non-intubated patient ( ICU-HAP ) - The first episode ICU-acquired pneumonia develop patient receive invasive ventilation ( i.e . Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia ( VAP ) ) . Exclusion criterion : - Age &lt; 18 year - Patients nosocomial pneumonia receive palliative treatment time assessment eligibility ( i.e . time clinical diagnosis ) - Previous inclusion study Research sit : More 150 ICUs 25 country worldwide agree participate study . Sample size : A minimum 10 consecutive ICU patient nosocomial pneumonia describe recruit per site . A sample size least 1000 ICU patient nosocomial pneumonia anticipate comprise dataset . This sample size choose provide generalisable data geographic region satisfy power consideration . Statistical analysis : Descriptive analytic , technique parametric non-parametric test use explore diagnostic , microbiological subgroup difference well clinical outcome nosocomial pneumonia . Cox regression use predict dichotomous outcome interest , include mortality pneumonia resolution . Independent predictor associate hazard ratio 95 % confidence interval report . A two-sided p-value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . Proposed Start End Date : The first site anticipate commence recruitment March 2016 stagger site recruitment ; however , site anticipate start recruitment first half 2016 ; site commence recruitment soon relevant Institutional Review Board approval obtain . Recruitment continue minimum target 10 patient reach . Sites opportunity recruitment study active . Completion recruitment anticipate occur end July 2017 . Dissemination Findings : Summary data present timely manner national international conference peer-reviewed journal .</detailed_description>
