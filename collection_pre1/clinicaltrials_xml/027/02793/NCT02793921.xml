	<detailed_description>The specific aim include : 1 . Compared usual care , examine whether 6-month exercise intervention improve cognitive function first six month AI therapy postmenopausal woman early stage breast cancer . Hypothesis 1 . Exercise improve cognitive function woman receive AI therapy domain specific fashion attention , executive memory function influence domain . 2 . Compared usual care , examine direct effect exercise neuroimaging metric brain health include regional gray matter volume , white matter architecture functional dynamic brain pro-inflammatory biomarkers ( IL-6 CRP primary outcome ; TNF-α secondary ) , explore direct effect exercise symptom ( fatigue , sleep problem , depression , anxiety ) . Hypothesis 2 . Exercise improve neuroimaging metric brain health pro-inflammatory biomarkers . 3 . Compared usual care , explore whether effect exercise cognitive function mediate ) neuroimaging metric cognitive function , b ) IL-6 , CRP TNF-α level c ) symptom ( fatigue , sleep problem , depression , anxiety ) , moderate E2 level first six month AI therapy .</detailed_description>
