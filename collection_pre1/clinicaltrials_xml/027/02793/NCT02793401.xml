	<detailed_description>Chronic shoulder pain , negatively affect quality life due pain loss function , third common painful condition musculoskeletal system [ 1 ] The aim study determine effective conventional physical treatment method ( HILT US ) pain daily activity patient chronic shoulder pain difficult treat , unfavorable effect patient life quality . This prospective , randomize , control , single blind study conduct Physical Treatment Rehabilitation Training Research Hospital ethic board approval obtained.A total 210 patient , present hospital chronic shoulder pain , evaluate inclusion study . Patients include study divide two group investigate physician , use simple randomization , treatment organize . Forms detail patient ' ( demographic , VAS score SPADI ) complete another investigate physician blind type treatment patient would receive . The investigating physician complete Post-treatment 1st day ( Post-T1st day ) Post-T finding 30th day ( Post-T 30th day ) form record data . Patients randomly divide two group receive treatment two week ( 14 day ) show : - Group 1 : Hotpack ( HP ) + Balneotherapy+ Exercise + HILT - Group 2 : Hotpack ( HP ) + Balneotherapy+ Exercise + US Patients group receive HP affect shoulder region 20 minute balneotherapy , mineral water pool 38-400C 20 minute , seven consecutive day . ROM exercise Codman exercise , level increase severity pain patient , give stretch strengthen exercise teach patients.The patient perform exercise daily two set five repeat set . HILT perform use BTL-6000 High Intensity Laser , 12 W ( watt ) , 1064 nm device hot laser Nd : YAG LASER source . BTL 4710 US device apply 3 MHz frequency , 1.5watt/cm2 intensity 25 cm2 surface area . Headpiece area device 5 cm2 , application perform head device position 90ยบ ( perpendicular ) full contact 5 minute use gel , perform continuous circular motion . Patients evaluate use VAS SPADI pre-treatment ( Pre-T ) , Post-T1st day Post-T 30th day .</detailed_description>
