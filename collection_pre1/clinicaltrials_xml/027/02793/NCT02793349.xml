	<brief_summary>ABSORB BTK Study : A prospective , multicenter , control clinical evaluation use bioresorbable drug elute stent arterial vasculature knee</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The ABSORB Bioresorbable Scaffold Below Knee Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study evaluate performance bioresorbable vascular scaffold coat drug Everolimus . This used treat short length blockage 55mm ( 5.5cm ) artery knee . This performed treat patient severe leg pain develop skin ulcer gangrene heal due insufficent blood supply . The ABSORB Everolimus Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold work similar principle drug elute stent use considerable time treat blocked artery . However product consist scaffold coat drug rather leave metallic stent blood vessel , product primarily deliver drug , give mechanical support blood vessel longer need scaffold absorbs body leave permanent metallic implant . This device use safely effectively artery supply heart clinical trial current practice also evaluate leg artery single-centre pilot study . This study aim evaluate 's use large number patient multiple centre compare historical control group metal drug elute stent . The study evaluate ultrasound angiographic derive patency artery 36 month follow-up time point . This data collect patient fulfill inclusion criterion treat followed time .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Stenotic ( &gt; 50 % ) occlusive atherosclerotic disease distal popliteal infrapopliteal arteries A maximum two focal target lesion one distal popliteal infrapopliteal vessel Length lesion maximally 55 mm , allow maximally 2 stent implanted Reference vessel diameter 2.5 mm4 mm Symptomatic critical limb ischemia ( Rutherford 3 , 4 , 5 ) Subject able take least one type thienopyridine ( e.g . clopidogrel ) acetylsalicylic acid The patient must &gt; 18 year age Lifeexpectancy 12 month The patient child bear potential negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day index procedure The patient must willing able return appropriate followup time duration study The patient must provide write patient informed consent approve ethic committee Patient refuse treatment The reference segment diameter suitable available stent design . Unsuccessfully treat ( &gt; 30 % residual stenosis ) proximal inflow limit arterial stenosis Untreatable lesion locate distal outflow artery More two infrapopliteal lesion limb Previously implant stent ( ) PTA lesion site Lesion location require kiss stent procedure Lesion lie within adjacent aneurysm Inflowlimiting arterial lesion leave untreated The patient know allergy heparin , Aspirin anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy bleed diatheses unable , unwilling , tolerate therapy . The patient take Phenprocoumon ( Marcumar ) . The patient history prior lifethreatening contrast medium reaction . The patient currently enrol another investigational device drug trial . The patient currently breastfeed , pregnant intend become pregnant . The patient mentally ill retard . Subject receive heart transplant organ transplant wait list organ transplant Subject receiving schedule receive anticancer therapy malignancy within 30 day prior procedure Subject receive immunosuppression therapy , know serious immunosuppressive disease ( e.g. , human immunodeficiency virus ) , severe autoimmune disease require chronic immunosuppressive therapy ( e.g. , systemic lupus erythematosus , etc . ) The patient also receive inhibitor CYP3A ( Itraconazole , Erythromycin ) , inducer CYP3A ( Rifampin ) within 90 day follow procedure . Subject receive schedule receive chronic anticoagulation therapy ( e.g. , heparin , coumadin ) Use alternative therapy ( e.g . atherectomy , cut balloon , laser , radiation therapy ) part index procedure</criteria>
