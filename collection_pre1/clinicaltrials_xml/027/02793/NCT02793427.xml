	<detailed_description>Primary objective : Determine whether AGEs could serve long-term retrospective indicator glycemic control type 1 diabetic patient determine use marker clinical practice therapeutic purpose patient monitoring . For purpose , necessary determine baseline pathophysiological range concentration serum AGEs find link AGEs glycemic control Secondary objective : ( 1 ) Evaluation early predictive potential AGEs onset diabetes complication . ( 2 ) Measurement fructosamine-3-kinase erythrocyte activity evaluation effect glycemic control diabetic patient accumulation AGEs . ( 3 ) Ancillary study : development new method evaluation glycation serum protein base use innovative technology vibrational spectroscopy ( Raman infrared ) . Protocol design : Cross-sectional single-center study use cohort diabetic child follow period 5 year . Population / patient : 118 child type 1 diabetes child without clinical complication 33 non-diabetic child . The group patient stratify duration diabetes : enrolled time discovery diabetes follow-up previously know diabetes . Control subject recruit among sibling diabetic patient follow University Hospital Reims among non-diabetic patient treat Hospital Reims disease interfere protocol , match age Â± 2 year . Plan investigation : First phase : collecting information inform consent child holder parental authority , inclusion patient achieve blood sample child ( control diabetic ) . For diabetic patient , blood collection include follow-up . Thus , additional sample necessary protocol . Second phase : monitoring diabetic child blood urine sample measurement skin fluorescence 5 year inclusion . No follow-up plan control subject . Conduct study : Inclusion patient blood collection . Determination AGEs ( pentosidine , carboxymethyllysine MG-H1 ) high performance liquid chromatography couple tandem mass spectrometry Laboratory Biology Pediatric Research . Statistical Analyses : Find link type 1 diabetes AGE concentration link diabetes duration concentration AGE Student test.ROC Curves propose reference value concentration AGE . Find link AGE concentration HbA1c value Spearman correlation test link AGE concentration HbA1c value ( HbA1c &lt; 7.5 % / 7.5 % &lt; HbA1c &lt; 8.5 % / HbA1c &gt; 8.5 % ) simple linear regression Kruskal Wallis test . Find link AGE concentration magnitude change HbA1c Spearman correlation test Pearson .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>IInclusion criterion : Diabetic patient Patient age 118 year recruit accord duration diabetes Patient type 1 diabetes Patient without clinical diabetes complication Patient parent agree sign informed consent participation Control subject Control subject recruit among sibling diabetes patient follow University Hospital Reims . Nondiabetic patient follow Reims University Hospital disease , accord appreciation investigator , may interfere current protocol expect result . Obtaining informed consent Patient holder parental authority . Exclusion criterion : Diabetic patient Patient monogenic diabetes MODY diabetes require permanent insulin therapy . Patient pathology ( accord appreciation investigator ) could disturb participation study Control subject Control subject require longterm frequently corticosteroid treatment treatment may disturb glucose metabolism Control subject chronic disease history severe disease ( malignant disease , kidney liver disease , ... ) Control subject significant ongoing recover acute disease Control subject obesity ( BMI great 97th percentile compare reference curve evolution BMI accord age ) .</criteria>
