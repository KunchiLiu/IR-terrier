	<detailed_description>Setting The study take place primary care health facility Chitwan , Nepal . The Department International Development ( DFID ) -sponsored Programme Improving Mental Health Care ( PRIME ) implement Chitwan , Nepal . PRIME aim improve coverage treatment priority mental disorder implement evaluate comprehensive mental health care package , integrate primary health care five low middle income country ( LMIC ) ( Nepal , India , South Africa , Ethiopia Uganda ) . The care package include provision psychosocial pharmacological intervention non-specialized primary health worker ( follow World Health Organization mental health Gap Action Programme ( mhGAP ) -Intervention Guide ) community counselor . Currently , mental health service systematically available primary health care . The facility include health post , primary health center , urban clinic . These part government health center represent first portal care . In facility , primary care provider refer health auxiliary staff : health assistant , community medical assistant , auxiliary nurse midwife . PRIME RESHAPE component conduct Transcultural Psychosocial Organization ( TPO ) Nepal , Nepali non-governmental mental health research training organization . Design The investigator use pilot cluster randomize trial design . Because attitudes clinical behavior influence peer ( reference ) , investigator anticipates high degree contagion among provider within facility . Moreover , clinical care restrict exclusive relationship single provider government health system . Therefore , patient care characterize see range provider within single facility course treatment . Therefore , cluster design health facility unit clustering require . Interventions The control arm include standard PRIME training supervision protocol Nepal . There two version PRIME training : one prescribers one non-prescribers . Prescribers refer health worker prescribe medication ( health assistant auxiliary health worker ) . Non-prescribers prescribe medication provide community outreach , assist vaccination within maternal child health program , promote adherence . Non-prescribers predominantly auxiliary nurse midwife . Training prescribers base mhGAP include target disorder depression , psychosis , epilepsy , harmful drinking . Psychosocial module focus communication skill , supportive technique , health education include base prior curriculum adapt Nepal . Training delivered psychiatrist experience psychosocial counselor . Following training , prescriber group participate monthly supervision session psychiatrist . Non-prescribers receive training include psychosocial basic , modify behavioral activation module , modify motivational interviewing module . These later psychological treatment , know Healthy Activity Program ( HAP ) Counseling Alcohol Programs ( CAP ) respectively , develop use South Asia non-specialists . Non-prescribers receive monthly supervision experience psychosocial counselor . RESHAPE-mh us basic model PRIME training supervision . For prescriber non-prescriber training , people mental illness ( PWMI ) participate co-facilitators . PWMI train serve co-facilitators use `` PhotoVoice '' —a participatory research approach photography use develop testimonial message . PWMI contribute personal testimonial , ongoing social contact , myth busting , provide recovery emphasis . In addition , health worker previously participate PRIME program receives train participate co-facilitator serf enthusiastic aspirational role model . The second component RESHAPE ongoing engagement PWMI monthly consumer consultation meeting . [ Note : In Duke Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) Pro00055042 National Institute Mental Health ( NIMH ) grant application K01MH104310 , RESHAPE refer `` Consumer Engagement Anti-Stigma ( CEAS ) Training . '' CEAS rename RESHAPE-mh . ] Participants Primary care worker intend direct beneficiary RESHAPE . Their patient intend indirect beneficiary . Primary care worker include prescribers ( health assistant auxiliary health worker ) non-prescribers ( auxiliary nurse midwife ) represent first contact care need . Medical doctor ( MBBS ) limit primary health center hospital usually see person encounter one low level cadre worker . In pilot , additional participant include PWMI train facilitator RESHAPE , mental health expert ( psychiatrist psychosocial counselor ) serve facilitator supervisor , research staff ( research assistant , field coordinator , external competency fidelity raters ) . For pilot , investigator plan recruit primary care worker ( prescribers non-prescribers ) participate PRIME scale-up phase subset patient . Randomization RESHAPE pilot cluster randomize trial . As mentioned , reason cluster randomization expect contagion level health facility . Health attitude behavior influence co-worker , therefore investigator expect intervention do one health worker facility influence peer . In addition , contagion may occur training among community health worker . Therefore , health care provider randomization plan randomize prescribers non-prescribers associate specific facility . Planned analysis Qualitative analysis : Focus group discussion ( FGD ) , cognitive interview , process evaluation note cod NVIVO ( software name ) analyze use content analysis theme cultural acceptability , experience consumer trainer , relevance clinical care , train duration , structure training , content training , follow-up engagement . Coding conduct among independent raters , inter-rater reliability calculate use Kappas . Data analysis conduct throughout step facilitate iterative revision finalization manual . Statistical analysis : The quantitative outcome interest summarize descriptively visually time provider ( 3 time point : pre- post-training , 6 month later ) patient ( 2 time point : study entry 6 month later ) study arm . Total validated domain-specific score obtain instrument . Patient ( PT ) -specific trend time score plotted examine between-PT difference determine plausible pattern ( e.g . linearity ) trend . This information use inform choice effect estimate ( e.g . difference slope mean specific follow-up time point ) subsequent cluster-randomized trial ( C-RCT ) . The profile group cluster study arm examine between-cluster between-arm variation PT outcomes . Using first PT measurement ( i.e . absence intervention ) , preliminary estimate within- between-cluster variance , within- between-primary care worker ( PCW ) variances intra-class correlation coefficient ( ICC ) PT outcomes estimate . Such estimate essential sample size calculation plan R01 C-RCT design . Such variance often guess obtained study , whereas investigator obtain context design-specific estimate use pilot data . Moreover , investigator able estimate variance component measure interest , PT-specific slope , appropriate . PCW-specific trend PCW-score examined use strategy PTs . Preliminary indicative estimate difference perception arm obtain . Because propose K01 study pilot , hypothesis-based inference testing perform . Instead , quantitative analysis focus description . Analyses use publication C-RCT pilot modification full-scale C-RCT . Ethics research governance Consent : Providers tell consent form two different train approach evaluate . They tell focus regard stigma may bias outcome . Nor tell main difference training presence PWMI co-facilitators may contribute attentional bias . Harms : The main risk factor psychological distress among consumer depend type interaction health care trainees training . If consumer feel engagement training comfortable training environment , investigator outline contingency plan regard use videotape testimonial . Given prior training healthcare consumer Nepal , investigator anticipate consumer find training experience non-distressing experience . Minimal risk harm treatment anticipate . If patient require medication , hospitalization , treatment , continue follow . Thus , disincentive patient provider transition care need . In addition risk great likelihood , issue consider 1 ) negative consequence confidentiality information obtain study ( include subject identity research participant information collect assessment abstract medical record review ) compromise . Treatment patient study discretion PCWs . PCW train include psychotherapy medication management . At time , PCWs may decide initiate medication . All patient expect receive optimal clinical care clinical judgment PCWs . PCWs supervise psychiatrist Chitwan provide information management receive referral patient worsen symptoms clinical concern . All change treatment result Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events report institutional review board . Research ethic approval : This protocol approve Duke University ( Protocol Number : Pro00055042 ) Nepal Health Research Council ( Regulatory Number : 110/2014 ) . Amendments : Amendments jointly review Duke University Nepal Health Research Council , well submit funder : National Institute Mental Health , USA . Timescale Trainings PRIME PRIME plus RESHAPE take place February—April 2016 . Providers follow one year evaluate retention , change knowledge , attitude , clinical competence . Patient enrol facility earlier one month training great 6 month train . They followed-up six month initial enrollment evaluation . Primary outcome data collection complete end June 2017 .</detailed_description>
