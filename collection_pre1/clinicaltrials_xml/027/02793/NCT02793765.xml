	<brief_summary>This clinical study evaluate role combination therapy docetaxel follow Provenge patient metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC , ( prostate cancer resistant medical surgical treatment low testosterone ) . The purpose study look combination therapy docetaxel follow Provenge correlate immunological biomarkers clinical result therapy . Biomarkers gene , protein molecule affect cancer cell grow , multiply , die respond compound body . The study drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Treatment administer outpatient basis . Patients receive 6 cycle docetaxel follow Provenge . Docetaxel antineoplastic ( chemotherapy affect cancer cell growth ) agent . Docetaxel dose 75 mg/m2 give intravenously 1-hour infusion every 21 day Day 1 6 cycle . Provenge immunotherapy ( vaccine make patient 's blood cell ) reprograms immune cell attack cancer . A course therapy consist three dos Provenge administer 2-week interval . The strategy aim determine whether cytokine production T cell infiltration tumor cell could favor regression use combination chemotherapy plus vaccine . Tissue endpoint include biopsy prior first chemotherapy first vaccine therapy end therapy . Prostate cancer tissue infiltrate study expression CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD25/FOX3P , CD56 , CTLA-4 , PD-1 , Ki67 . Additional immunological endpoint secondary antigen spread various cytokine biomarkers .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) develop serial treatment resistance consider incurable . It largely indolent disease , would give body time mount effective immune response . CRPC therefore potentially well suited vaccine therapy . Docetaxel antineoplastic agent belong taxoid family . The FDA-approved course therapy prostate cancer consist 75 mg/m2 docetaxel give intravenously 1-hour infusion every 21 day Day 1 . Sipuleucel-T ( Provenge ) , FDA-approved cancer vaccine therapy manufacture culture individual 's freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) , include antigen-presenting cell ( APCs ) T cell , fusion protein ( PA-2024 ) compose prostatic acid phosphatase ( PAP ) link granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) . A course therapy consist three dos Provenge administer 2-week interval . This open-label phase II study taxane-naïve patient metastatic CRPC docetaxel follow Provenge . Adult ( age &gt; 18 year ) men metastatic CRPC . pathologically-confirmed adenocarcinoma prostate clinical radiologic evidence metastatic disease progress despite treatment anti-androgens , inhibitor adrenal-produced androgen ( abiraterone ) , androgen receptor inhibitor ( enzalutamide ) , , prior study entry candidate receive Standard Care chemotherapy ( e.g. , docetaxel/prednisone ) immunotherapy ( Provenge ) , enrol study . This study recruit total 32 patient metastatic CRPC . Patients receive 6 cycle docetaxel follow Provenge . Treatment administer outpatient basis . Patients must meet one follow prognostic criterion : - PSA doubling time ≤6 month - &gt; 10 bone lesion ( meet PSA double time criterion ) - Visceral metastasis - Bone lymph node lesions The primary objective study characterize immunological biomarkers therapy correlate immunological biomarkers clinical outcome . The strategy aim determine whether cytokine production T cell infiltration tumor cell could favor regression use combination chemotherapy plus vaccine . Tissue endpoint include biopsy prior chemotherapy , day 14 rest period therapy vaccine therapy . Prostate cancer tissue infiltrate study expression CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD25/FOX3P , CD56 , CTLA-4 , PD-1 , Ki67 . Additional immunological endpoint secondary antigen spread various cytokine biomarkers .</detailed_description>
