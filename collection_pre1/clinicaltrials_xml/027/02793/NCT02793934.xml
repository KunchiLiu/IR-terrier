	<brief_title>The Pilot Project Development Of MEdical Rehabilitation System Russian Federation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The program perform in-patient out-patient rehabilitation department 13 region Russian Federation ( total 244 department ) . The basic goal Programme : 1 . To develop system organization medical rehabilitation provide succession rehabilitation care Russia cover need . 2 . To improve accessibility rehabilitation care system successive 3-stages 3-level medical rehabilitation 3 . To develop multidisciplinary approach medical rehabilitation stage medical organization different level 4 . To improve patient 's daily living activity , functioning , enable participation , reduce sick-leaves duration work absenteeism , increase social role community , prevent pain recurrence chronicity , prevent recurrent event hospitalization 5 . To develop efficacy criterion medical rehabilitation stage rehabilitation establish logistic pathway patient rehabilitation 6 . To implement educational programme personnel PRM accord European model . 7 . Preparation introduce new specialty Russia - doctor PRM 8 . To establish financial method calculate cost tariff rehabilitation care patient different diseases/conditions stage rehabilitation medical organization different level 9 . To improve financial efficacy medical rehabilitation substantiation new tariff price rehabilitation care 10 . To demonstrate effectiveness `` new '' model medical rehabilitation system compare traditional model multicenter study , patient ACE , AMI THR . 11 . To evaluate clinical efficacy `` new '' model medical rehabilitation compare `` old '' model patient ACE , AMI THR follow indicator : in-hospital 3-months mortality , number complication , length hospital stay , degree recovery function , activity participation . To calculate economic advantage `` new '' model medical rehabilitation patient ACE , AMI THR calculation financial cost one case complete course rehabilitation To study characteristic disorder function participation . To develop methodological framework establishment register patient receive rehabilitation Russia . 12 . To develop basic establish quality assessment system rehabilitative care Russian Federation . The difference new old model rehabilitation : 1 . The doctor-patient relationship In old model - Patient passive recipient service In new model - The patient-oriented approach 2 . Diagnosis In old model -According International Classification Diseases ( ICD-10 ) In new model - ICD -10 ICF 3 . Doctors task In old model - To assign necessary consultation expert conduct rehabilitation activity accordance standard care . In new model - To organize discussion patient problem , formulate achieve goal rehabilitation short-term long-term outcome , evaluate criterion rehabilitation treatment , organize effective use time equipment require rehabilitation adequately address problem technology 4 . Education In old model - Education separate specialty physiotherapy ( kinesiotherapy ) , acupuncture ( RTI ) , massage therapy , speech therapy , etc . In new model - The unified system education professional medical rehabilitation accordance European training program doctor Physical Rehabilitation Medicine , modular principle , network form educational program 5 . Work organization In old model - Everyone work accordance official duty , expert free decide treatment do patient ( kinesiotherapist , psychologist etc ) In new model - Multidisciplinary approach . Experts joint discussion set goal rehabilitation , task , time solution , performer , base patient 's need . 6 . The composition rehabilitation team In old model - Instructor-methodologist exercise therapy doctor , physiotherapy doctor nurse , massage nurse , speech therapist , clinical psychologist , nurse In new model - Clinician relevant specialty , instructor-methodologist physical therapy physician , doctor nurse physiotherapy , ergotherapist , physiotherapy instructor , massage nurse , speech therapist , clinical psychologist , nurse 7. length stay In old model -Fixed ( 14 , 21 30 day , depend stage rehabilitation ) accordance National regulation care In new model -Duration stay programme depend goal objective individually patient . When goal , objective achievement certain clinical / instrumental parameter reach patient transfer next stage discharge 8 . The criterion refer patient next stage rehabilitation In old model -completion standard course care In new model -A single algorithm completion rehabilitation certain stage ( project participant ) goal objective reach 9 . Payment case In old model -Fixed tariff complete case Diagnosis relate group ( DRG ) In new model -According clinical statistical group three stage rehabilitation - case mix group ( CMG ) 10 . The volume work do In old model -According regulation standard treatment In new model -Required achieve objective case 11 . An audit rehabilitation measure In old model -no In new model -Internal external Inclusion/exclusion criteria The inclusion exclusion criterion programme define Russian professional association ( ARUR ) precisely describe Protocols Pilot Project ( Neurology , Cardiology Orthopedia Protocols , respectively ) . The Programme focus adult patient gender age 18 y.o. , next condition : 1 . Acute cerebrovascular event ( ACE , ischemic stroke intracerebral hemorrhage - specialty neurology ) 2 . Acute myocardial infarction ( AMI , specialty cardiology ) 3 . Patients total hip replacement ( THR , specialty orthopaedia ) Our management stroke , AMI THR refer international guideline although scientific evidence still lack physical technique . Our programme base individual approach patient . During different phase diseases put emphasis adequate drug treatment , increase exercise 's tolerance , gradual mobilization verticalization simultaneous improvement daily activity , increase mobility self-servicing , improvement activity participation . Safety patient right define National regulation , national law internal rule . Each patient sign inform consent form . Each patient sign inform consent . The patient his/her relative invite participate multidisciplinary team meeting . All patient 's medical functional information , assessment monitoring data record manually standardize medical documentation . It fulfil entry discharge level treatment . All Programme document store clinical archive accessible periodic internal external audit outcome assessment . One feature Pilot Project Russia use ICF assessment efficacy medical rehabilitation configure activity individualize rehabilitation process For model patient include Pilot Project set domain ICF create . Analysis ICF domains do automatically soft `` ICF-reader '' . The program `` ICF-reader '' also help generate documentation adoption patient patient 's discharge transfer . The main function `` ICF-reader '' accumulation analysis data . Each patient assign unique number , allow identify him/her electronic database program `` ICF-reader '' . Each center responsible work program `` ICF-reader '' . In second phase Pilot Project , program `` ICF-reader '' give opportunity establish rehabilitation diagnosis basis ICF , option ICF assessment use rating scale . At 1st stage rehabilitation patient include programme detail examination , stabilization condition assessment rehabilitation potential . On basis primary examination use ICF tool individualize programme rehabilitation , goal rehabilitation method technology establish . The transfer patient one stage rehabilitation another depend : achievement define goal functional parameter ( data laboratory , instrumental , functional method , result clinical examination appropriate scale ) , assessment activity participation achievement requirement National regulation ( number appropriate diagnostic method , prespecified treatment , prevention procedure etc ) The degree functional disturbance assess appropriate diagnostic method : laboratory , instrumental clinical . Referral patient : At 1st stage rehabilitation ( acute unit ) patient include rehabilitation process first 48 hour onset event surgery examination doctor ( trained PRM ) member multidisciplinary team . Each member multidisciplinary team assess patient begin end stage rehabilitation appropriate pre-defined clinical scale . At 2nd stage rehabilitation patient include rehabilitation process admission 1st stage ( referral PRM doctor 1st stage ) At 3rd stage rehabilitation patient include rehabilitation process admission 1st 2nd stage ( referral PRM doctor 1st 2nd stage , referral general practitioner assessment multidisciplinary team ) .</detailed_description>
