	<detailed_description>Two commercial whole grain rye crisp bread process differently ( unfermented sourdough ferment ) refine wheat control product test study . The rye crisp bread product contain similar ingredient . All product provide similar amount available carbohydrate ( 30g ) . The total amount test product 50-60g . The specific primary aim study : To conduct short-term breakfast intervention study human ( n = 24 ) compare effect 2 high-fiber rye crisp bread product process different way ( sourdough ferment unfermented ) refine wheat control crisp bread part normal breakfast self-rated appetite , postprandial glucose insulin concentration . Difference post-prandial insulin response product primary endpoint . Secondary aim ( conduct significant effect primary endpoint demonstrate ) : To assess change hormone relation self-perceived satiety , hunger desire eat difference chemical microstructural composition test food .</detailed_description>
