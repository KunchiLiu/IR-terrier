	<brief_summary>Congenital cataract ( CC ) lead cause childhood visual disability treatable childhood blindness worldwide1 . CC patient wide range presentation lens opacity generally categorize several group base etiology , anatomical position , shape lens opacity . Cataractous eye CC patient also frequently complicate anterior segment abnormality due close anatomical relationship similar developmental origin . Lens opacities different position may relate specific anterior segment abnormality ; example , anterior polar cataract associate great corneal astigmatism ( CA ) . However , study systematically related position lens opacity specific anterior segment abnormities , mainly due small number CC patient , lack proper equipment , lack awareness important relationship .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Congenital cataract ( CC ) lead cause childhood visual disability treatable childhood blindness worldwide1 . CC patient wide range presentation lens opacity generally categorize several group base etiology , anatomical position , shape lens opacity . Cataractous eye CC patient also frequently complicate anterior segment abnormality due close anatomical relationship similar developmental origin . Lens opacities different position may relate specific anterior segment abnormality ; example , anterior polar cataract associate great corneal astigmatism ( CA ) . However , study systematically related position lens opacity specific anterior segment abnormities , mainly due small number CC patient , lack proper equipment , lack awareness important relationship . Using large CC database Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center ( ZOC ) , current study compare anterior segment characteristic CC patient lens opacity different position propose modify CC category system base specific relationship position lens opacity anterior segment characteristic . Knowledge relationships beneficial understanding CC occurrence development clinical significance CC diagnosis treatment .</detailed_description>
