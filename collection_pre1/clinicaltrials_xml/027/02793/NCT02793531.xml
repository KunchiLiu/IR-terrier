	<brief_summary>Weight loss muscle waste commonly occur patient cancer , negatively influence quality life , treatment response survival . Weight change patient cancer may consequence energy imbalance disturbance protein metabolism , poor treatment tolerance , hormonal alteration , systemic inflammation etc . This result body composition modification favor fat gain and/or lean body mass loss early stage cancer . However , advance cancer mostly loss fat mass lean mass find . Unfortunately , gain muscle mass difficult achieve . In previous study Investigators , bolus ( 15 g ) essential amino acid mixture present milk protein able stimulate whole-body protein anabolism equally effectively weight-losing patient lung cancer . This indicate high potential protein high essential amino acid therapeutic agent increase muscle mass patient . However , dose-response effect reach optimal whole-body protein anabolism yet unknown differ among patient . Therefore , Investigators would like study effect several dosage protein high essential amino acid level , administer sip feeding , whole-body protein anabolism patient cancer comparison healthy old adult . Furthermore , individual protein requirement cancer patient may establish cornerstone nutritional support . Specifically establish 'the anabolic threshold ' , protein breakdown equal synthesis response relation protein intake net protein synthesis critical .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , Investigators test follow hypothesis : A protein meal high EAA level stimulate protein anabolism dose-dependent way exact relationship differs among cancer patient . The primary endpoint extent stimulation net whole-body protein synthesis level protein intake individual cancer control subject . This project provide important clinical information anabolic capacity dietary protein high EAA level level protein intake required become anabolic cancer patient individual base . In way , study provide preliminary data development individualized nutritional strategy stop process ongoing muscle loss cancer patient . General aim : - To study whole-body protein anabolic effect several dosage high-quality protein sip feed cancer subject compare healthy control . - To investigate anabolic threshold subject cancer compare healthy control . The mechanisms underlying lean tissue loss cancer remain unraveled , may complexity metabolic alteration present symptom weight loss become obvious . Multiple factor like anorexia inflammation present cancer , contribute loss lean tissue patient create drain body protein store . Previous study show oral supplementation large amount calorie cancer partially successful indicate composition dietary supplement meal important successfully counteract muscle waste . Although previous study support concept supplement high-quality milk proteins lung cancer subject , dose-response anabolic effect proteins high EAA level still unclear . Furthermore , insight actual protein requirement cancer . The knowledge gain study benefit insight term promotion protein gain feed cancer patient .</detailed_description>
