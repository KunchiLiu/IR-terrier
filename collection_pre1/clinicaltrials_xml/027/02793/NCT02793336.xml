The study continuation two already establish cohort study : `` STOP MIP '' , enrol pregnant woman follow delivery `` baby-cohort '' , enrol baby mother include cohort follow first year life . Continuous follow baby 4 year old increase understanding long term impact especially vivax malaria . The cohort link randomize control trial ( RCT ) offer cohort patient enrol RCT diagnose malaria ( symptomatic ) , allow estimate treatment effectiveness .</brief_summary>
