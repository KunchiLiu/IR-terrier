	<brief_summary>A structural leg length discrepancy ( SLLD ) common clinical problem . Its prevalence estimate 40-70 % . Those suffer limp long time may lead follow-up low back pain lower limb musculoskeletal disorder . Although low limb triple view x-ray consider current technique determine LLD , costly time consume every hospital afford , case radiograph , patient expose radiation . Therefore , necessary develop rapid clinical assessment method gather exterior parameter build Regression model measure discrepancy determine LLD accurately . While use shoe lift correct discrepancy easiest conservative intervention LLD , still many controversy much height add clinically academically . The optimal height add depend feedback user gait performance . The best gait performance measure kinematic performance center mass body walk . Therefore , project want compare treatment response two kind shoe lift height correction method LLD : give 80 % discrepancy shoe lift height correction triple view x-ray give optimal shoe lift height correction analyze kinematic performance center mass body .</brief_summary>
