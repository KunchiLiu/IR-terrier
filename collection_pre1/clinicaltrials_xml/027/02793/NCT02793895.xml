	<brief_summary>The aim SEARCH-AF trial evaluate novel diagnostic tool detect post-operative atrial fibrillation flutter ( POAF/AFL ) cardiac surgical subject early , sub-acute post-operative period . The population include cardiac surgical subject either develop risk develop new onset POAF/AFL risk stroke , determine CHA2DS2-VASC ( congestive heart failure , hypertension , age ≥75 year ( 2 point ) , diabetes mellitus , previous stroke/transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) ( 2 point ) , vascular disease , age 65-74 year , sex class ( female ) ) score . These subject must history AF/AFL cardiac surgery . The intervention group undergo 30 day continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring adhesive , patch-based monitor ( Medtronic SEEQ™ mobile cardiac telemetry system ) . The control group receive usual care , involve plan cardiac rhythm test within first 30 day study randomization . The primary outcome documentation sustain atrial fibrillation flutter within first 30 day randomization . In addition , subject group undergo 14 day continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring Medtronic SEEQ™ mobile cardiac telemetry system 6±1 month index cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim SEARCH-AF trial evaluate novel diagnostic tool detect post-operative atrial fibrillation flutter ( POAF/AFL ) cardiac surgical subject early , sub-acute post-operative period . Its primary objective test whether enhanced cardiac rhythm monitoring adhesive , continuous monitor result higher rate atrial fibrillation flutter ( AF/AFL ) detection 30 day randomization post-cardiac surgical subject risk develop post-operative atrial arrhythmia , compare usual care . The study design open-label , two-arm randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare strategy enhance cardiac rhythm monitoring vs. usual care 396 post-cardiac surgical subject risk develop POAF/AFL . The primary endpoint proportion subject cumulative AF/AFL burden ≥6 minute documentation AF/AFL 12-lead ECG within 30 day randomization . Clinical endpoint adjudicate independent committee physician . The study population involve post-cardiac surgical subject high risk stroke , define CHA2DS2-VASC score ≥4 CHA2DS2-VASC ≥2 additional risk factor develop POAF/AFL . These subject must history AF/AFL pre-operatively . Subjects meet inclusion criterion randomize 1:1 ratio one follow 2 arm : ( ) Enhanced cardiac rhythm monitoring ( intervention group ) ( ii ) Usual care ( control group ) . Subjects intervention group receive 30 day continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring Medtronic SEEQ™ mobile cardiac telemetry system . Monitoring begin day randomization . Subjects usual care group undergo protocol-mandated cardiac rhythm monitoring first 30 day randomization . All subject follow-up visit 45-52 day hospital discharge 6±1 month surgery . At 6±1 month , subject undergo 14 day continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring SEEQ™ mobile cardiac telemetry system . A telephone follow-up perform subject 9±1 month surgery .</detailed_description>
