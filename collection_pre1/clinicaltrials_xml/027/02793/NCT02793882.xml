	<brief_summary>1.0 Background &amp; Introduction Positron emission tomography / computer tomography ( PET/CT ) nuclear medicine procedure base measurement positron emission radiolabelled tracer . This technology allow biologic process visualize measured whole body image . Common radiotracers use today USA Europe radiolabelled choline derivative analogs 18F-fluoromethylcholine ( FMCh ) 18F-fluoroethylcholine ( FECh ) , broadly FCH . Both fluorinated choline analog extensively study display seemingly identical biological , radiopharmaceutical radiochemical property . Both extensively study human prostate cancer , FMCh slightly publish data FECh . Imaging radiolabelled choline derivative use determine sit abnormal choline metabolism use characterize prostate cancer , extensive data literature . PET/CT radiolabelled choline derivative consider standard care expert available , however JGH , anatomic imaging CT MRI , bone scan current diagnostic imaging modality use patient population . Prostate cancer cell increase choline uptake compare normal tissue , form molecular basis technique . The Gleason score , histopathologic measure tumor aggressiveness , one important prognostic factor disease . The objective study evaluate degree uptake measure maximum standard uptake value ( SUVmax ) FCH PET/CT prostate cancer correlate Gleason score initial biopsy . 2.0 Study Objectives The objective study evaluate patient-wide SUVmax 18F-FCH PET/CT locoregional metastatic prostate cancer correlate histopathologic Gleason score initial biopsy . It hypothesize SUVmax correlate positively Gleason score . This interest non-invasive risk stratification may possible future . 3.0 Study Design This single-site JGH-only open label study one ( 1 ) 18F-FCH PET/CT perform study participant . A PET/CT scan take 3 hour . 4.0 Safety &amp; Ethics The radiation dose patient fluorinated choline derivative compare favorably major PET tracer widespread clinical use , 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) . The safety fluorinated choline derivative dispute investigator expect number adverse event study ( near ) zero . There establish toxicology diagnostic dos fluorinated choline derivative . There salient ethical consideration identify . The treat physician free order diagnostic therapeutic intervention study patient , care modify restricted way . Treating physician free incorporate information acquire study discard relevant . Care patient may improve additional information provide FCH PET/CT , otherwise unchanged . No vulnerable population include study . 5.0 Confidentiality All information ( medical history , physical examination , PET/CT result ) keep strictly confidential authorized personnel access . The report PET/CT contain password protect radiology &amp; nuclear medicine RIS database ( RadImage ) diagnostic imaging report securely store . Clinical PET/CT report store indefinitely , whereas study data keep locked PI destroy 10 year . 6.0 Population , Sample Size Recruitment A maximum 225 competent adult male medically stable prostate cancer patient available Gleason Scores enter study . Patients recruit urologists clinical setting . Initial contact consent department urology .</brief_summary>
