	<brief_summary>The purpose study 1 . To explore effect sarcopenia recovery post stroke hemiplegia 2 . To explore effect stroke sarcopenia relationship degree sarcopenia respiration swallow function 3 . To quantify qualify post stroke loss muscle mass 4 . To validity use echointensity elastography evaluation sarcopenia . By reach list purpose , sarcopenia view one serious post stroke complication closely related worth functional outcome , thereby emphasize importance evaluation sarcopenia well prevention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measurement Sarcopenia Post-stroke Rehabilitation Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sarcopenia occur frequently among old population . The change rather occur early trauma generalized illness . However , nature sarcopenia different geriatric population . Post stroke sarcopenia underestimated however reduction motor uni number begin within 4 hour post stroke 3 week , sarcopenia see hemiplegia normal side . This muscular weakness hinder functional recovery process .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria stroke patient First ever subacute stroke patient whose lesion confirm brain imaging ( MRI/CT ) Patients difficulty premorbid ambulation activity daily live . Patients follow 1 step obey Patients perform hand function test Patients whose laboratory test , neurologic , cognitive , dysphagia evaluation complete within 1 month onset date . Patients admitted/transferred department least 4 week , follow conventional rehabilitation protocol . Patients least 2 MRS ( Modified Ranking Score ) FAC ( Functional ambulation category ) score . stroke patient Patients meet list criterion Patients double hemiplegia Patients systemic disease affect loss muscle mass causr malnutrition . ( Example : chronic inflammatory disease , autoimmune disease , chronic intestinalis , active tuberculosis , immunocompromised state , AIDS , malignancy , pregnancy , amputation , operation . Patients joint contracture difficult perform sonographic evaluation . Traumatic brain injury patient .
