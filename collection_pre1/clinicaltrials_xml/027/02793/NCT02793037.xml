	<brief_summary>Trial Design - Objectives Purpose The aim study perform proof concept successful retention outcome measure zirconia RBBs replacement miss canine posterior teeth ( 6-8mm span ) exhibit similar survival rate ( 95 % ) metal ceramic RBBs 3 year short term ( Botelho 2006 ) . The use monolithic extra-coronal zirconia RBBs posterior region appear report literature ( A search pf Pub Med Google Scholar show similar study publish - pubmed.gov ; Keywords : `` zirconia '' , `` resin '' , `` clinical '' assess 17/10/2015 AND google scholar ; Keywords : `` zirconia '' , `` resin bond fix partial denture '' , `` resin bond fixed dental prosthesis '' , `` Maryland '' , `` resin bond bridge '' `` posterior '' , `` clinical '' ) In addition , currently appear clinical trial plan finish area ( clinicaltrial.gov ; Keywords : `` zirconia '' , `` resin '' assess 17/10/2015 ) use zirconia RBBs posterior region . This reveal gap literature use zirconia replace posterior teeth prosthesis . The primary outcome measure would : success ie . prosthesis retention ie . fall The secondary outcome measure would : - complication prosthesis tip , drift fracture . - patient center outcome ( satisfaction oral health relate quality life ) RBBs The hypothesis 2-unit cantilever zirconia RBBs successful current data 2-unit cantilever metal-ceramic RBBs centre difference patient center outcome . The Primary review appointment 1 , 6 , 12 , 24 36 month . However , long term follow perform centre experience long term study ( 9.5 year - Botelho 2014 ) . A randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) compare metal-ceramic RBBs NOT perform 5-year success rate metal-ceramic ( Botelho 2006 ) anterior zirconia ( Sasse 2014 ) prosthesis high 95 % small difference would mean unattainable large sample size equivalence test ( Burns 2001 ) . Significance implication Zirconia significant strength great stiffness base metal alloy display clinical outcome comparable metal-ceramic conventional crown bridge ( Heintze 2010 , Sailer 2007 ) . Well polished zirconia observe low wear rate porcelain ( Stober 2014 ) Zirconia RBBs posterior tooth replacement offer esthetic biocompatible treatment option patient traditional ceramic-metal RBBs . It anticipate patient demand would high prosthesis successful ( retentive ) . These result would re-write establish dental prosthodontics textbook would first centre report routine use 2-unit extracoronal all-zirconia RBB replacement miss posterior teeth . Research plan methodology The sample pool would obtain patient present Prince Philip Dental Hospital , University Hong Kong request need replacement one miss teeth.. They clinically assess eligibility invite participate write consent study . After treatment review 3rd year endpoint study . Further review beyond undertaken .</brief_summary>
