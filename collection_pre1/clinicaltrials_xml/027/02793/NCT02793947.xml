	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine efficacy safety peri-incisional multimodal injection post-operative pain control follow operative management femur fracture . Enrolled subject prospectively randomize either peri-incisional injection control cohort . Patients treat standard care surgical technique treat orthopaedic surgeon patient 's specific fracture pattern . The patient randomize injection cohort receive intra-operative injection 400 mg ropivacaine , 0.6 mg epinephrine , 5 mg morphine local superficial deep peri-incisional tissue general anesthesia . Visual analog pain score collect every 4 hour surgery first two post-operative day . Total narcotic consumption also record eight hour interval first two post-operative day . Medication related side effect monitor . The investigator hypothesize peri-incisional injection cohort demonstrate improve pain profile utilize less parenteral narcotic analgesia early post-operative period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine efficacy safety peri-incisional multimodal injection post-operative pain control follow operative management femur fracture . Patients identified way direct presentation orthopaedic trauma service acute femur fracture . If patient meet parameter study enrollment ( inclusion/exclusion criterion ) patient approach introduction study member surgical team . If patient agreeable study enrollment , he/she complete write informed consent process . This study protocol receive formal approval University Iowa Institutional Review Board . The study design prospective , randomize , double-blind comparative trial . Patients randomly assign two treatment group : peri-incisional multimodal injection control ( injection ) . In order create balance cohort respect intervention , randomization complete block format across six discrete surgical technique : proximal femur open reduction internal fixation ( dynamic hip screw , trochanteric stabilize plate ) , distal femur open reduction internal fixation ( lateral peri-articular lock plate ) , cephalomedullary fixation , intramedullary fixation ( antegrade retrograde intramedullary device without fix angle construct femoral head ) , percutaneous fixation , arthroplasty ( hemiarthroplasty total hip arthroplasty ) . Randomization perform use Microsoft Excel ( Microsoft , Redmond , Washington ) generate random number . The patient enrol investigation well nursing staff perform post-operative assessment blind treatment allocation . Each patient treat standard care technique choose treat surgeon regardless whether patient decides enroll study . Written inform consent obtain surgical procedure addition independent study consent . All surgical procedure complete general anesthesia . No spinal , regional , preemptive anesthesia/analgesic regimen employ per study protocol . Surgical drain placement pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis standardize . Post-operative pain management continue per institutional standard care combination intravenous oral narcotic analgesia . The post-operative pain regimen specify altered study protocol . Patients randomize peri-incisional injection cohort receive single intra-operative injection subject general anesthesia follow completion fracture fixation/instrumentation . The local anesthetic cocktail include 400 mg 0.75 % ropivacaine ( 53.33 mL ) , 0.6 mg 1 mg/mL epinephrine ( 0.6 mL ) , 5 mg 0.5 mg/mL morphine sulfate ( 10 mL ) , 36.07 mL 0.9 % sodium chloride solution . All pharmacologic agent anesthetic cocktail FDA approve . For intra-articular proximal femur procedure cocktail evenly distribute deep ( synovium , capsule , periosteum , gluteus musculature ) superficial ( fascia lata , vastus lateralis , subcutaneous plane ) tissue prior wound closure . The pattern follow extra-articular proximal femur procedure without direct injection synovium capsule . The injection similarly distribute deep ( synovium , capsule , periosteum ) superficial ( quadriceps musculature , subcutaneous plane ) tissue prior wound closure distal femur procedure . Injections intramedullary nail place around nail entry site bone superficial tissue entry site cross lock location . All infiltration complete blunt trochar minimize risk intravascular injection . The primary outcome visual analog pain score first two post-operative day . Patients instructed use 10-cm visual analog scale describe current level comfort end point zero correspond `` pain '' ten correspond `` extreme possible pain . '' Pain assessment complete patient rest standardize interval immediately prior surgery , post-anesthesia care unit ( captured mean individual data point ) , every 4 hour follow surgery first two post-operative day . Visual analog pain score collect chart nursing staff inpatient ward . All nursing staff remain blind treatment allocation . Physician staff knowledge intra-operative treatment randomization involve record outcome measure . The secondary outcome measure total narcotic consumption , wound complication , drug-related side effect . Narcotic consumption record every eight hour first two post-operative day transform narcotic equivalent . Every fifteen minute post-anesthesia care unit every four hour first two post-operative day nurse personnel monitor patient via direct observation query medication side effect related ropivacaine toxicity include blurred vision , hear problem , transient peripheral paralysis , dizziness , convulsion , uncontrolled muscle contraction , hypotension , bradycardia , new onset arrhythmia . Anesthesiology staff also perform two standardized post-operative assessment recovery room first post-operative day screen adverse effect relate injection . An priori power analysis complete sample size determination primary outcome measure . A preliminary retrospective analysis reveal standard deviation 2.5 visual analog pain scale twelve hour follow surgery ( unpublished data ) . Prior literature suggest change 1.0-1.3 point visual analog scale clinically significant . Therefore , investigator determine total 44 patient require per study group order detect 1.5 point difference visual analog scale power 80 % P-value 0.05 . The Student test chi-squared test association use compare continuous categorical variable two group , respectively . Statistical significance define p &lt; 0.05 . Patient confidentiality maintain time . Only approve research team personnel review medical record . Only minimal data necessary answer research question obtain . Collected electronic data store password protect server . Written inform consent document store locked filing cabinet Department Orthopaedics Rehabilitation University Iowa Hospitals Clinics . Upon publication completion data analysis information patient identifier destroy .</detailed_description>
