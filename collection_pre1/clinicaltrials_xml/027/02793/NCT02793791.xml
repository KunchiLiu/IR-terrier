	<brief_title>Prophylactic Treatment Hepatic Dysplastic Nodules HBsAg Positive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatic dysplastic nodule ( DNs ) include high grade dysplastic nodule ( HGDNs ) low grade dysplastic nodule ( LGDNs ) , incidence high patient liver cirrhosis . Once diagnosed , late version major guideline recommend enhanced follow-up , treatment would provide diagnosis hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) establish follow-up . While hand , mount evidence show DNs relatively high transition rate progress HCC . In 154 patient chronic hepatitis cirrhosis , Kobayashi et al . report annual transition rate 20 % patient HGDN 10 % patient LGDN . The 5-year cumulative transition rate HGDN LGDN 80.8 % 30.2 % , respectively . Even regenerative nodule ( RNs ) without dysplasia evolve HCC 12.4 % .More recently , Sato et al . study 68 large regenerative nodule ( LRNs ) 20 DNs 1,500 consecutive nodular lesion ; 50-month transition rate 13.6 % LRNs 40 % DNs . Earlier study support finding . Adenomatous polyp accept precursor colorectal cancer ( CRC ) remove prevent cancer . Compared transition rate , A recent cohort study estimate average annual transition rate advance adenoma CRC men 3.1 % , 5-year-transition rate around 15 % . Since transition rate hepatic DNs much high colorectal adenomatous polyp , `` enhance follow-up '' really best choice treatment ? So proposed clinical trial , hypothesize hepatic DNs discover patient chronic hepatitis B , early minimally-invasive ablation treatment decrease incidence HCC . Recruited patient divide two group randomly , `` Observation group '' , patient followed-up receive therapy ; `` Ablation group '' , DNs ablate minimally-invasive ablation therapy , include RFA , PEI , MWA , etc . All patient followed-up accord AASLD guideline . Then incidence HCC two arm compare .</detailed_description>
