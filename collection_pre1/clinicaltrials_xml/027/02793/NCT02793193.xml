	<brief_summary>The gut-brain axis describe important , gut function central nervous system ( CNS ) function . The microbiota gut play important role axis neural , immune endocrine system . Previous study find alter gut microbiota ( GM ) composition could change CNS function animal human . Probiotics show positive effect improve stress response animal stress related psychiatry human . The current study investigate probiotic improve response social stress healthy participant patient irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , stress-related disease , whether probiotic action counteract locally act antibiotic , Rifaximin . The investigator use Cyberball paradigram induce social stress magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) record neural response relate social stress . The administration probiotic new strategy mental health management treatment gastrointestinal ( GI ) disorder future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Understanding neural mechanism underlie experience social stress may help prevent development IBS help people maintain mental health . Social distress examine Cyberball paradigm develop peer child autism spectrum disorder , people social anxiety disorder borderline personality disorder . These study provide researcher clinical evidence validity paradigm patient . Here investigator examine neural response IBS patient acute stress induce Cyberball game acute intervention probiotic 4 week alleviate stress response . The study firstly conduct healthy volunteer whose GM disturb antibiotic Rifaximin simulate IBS patient , see neural response social exclusion effect probiotic Bifidobacterium longum 1714 ( Study 1 ) . The second study conduct clinical trial IBS patient meet diagnosis base Rome I , II , III criterion ( Study 2 ) . Study 1 &amp; 2 randomized , double blind , double dummy design , participant visit laboratory 3 time ( M1 , M2 , M3 ) : measurement baseline 2 period intervention ( P1 , P2 ) . Each period last 4 week , result duration study 8 week total . Group 1 take B.longum 1714 4 week begin Rifaximin 4 week , test effect B.longum 1714 also Rifaximin could block effect B.longum 1714 . Group 2 also take B.longum 1714 first 4 week , test effect B.longum 1714 . In second 4 week , participant take placebo , comparison Group 1 . Group 3 take Rifaximin 4 week placebo 4 week , test pure effect Rifaximin . Group 4 take Rifaximin begin B.longum 1714 , test B.longum 1714 normalize central function impair Rifaximin . 1 week placebo add 3 week Rifaximin 4 week B.longum 1714 washout period avoid Rifaximin directly kill B.longum 1714 . Group 5 take placebo two 4-weeks period control group . Participants allow eat certain kind food . As mentioned exclusion criterion , participant eat probiotic/prebiotic containing food supplement , potentially immune-enhancing dietary supplement either . The food avoid summarized list probiotic/prebiotic contain food . Also , participant ask record food take day intervention , take photo . Nutritional information food take participant analyze use online tool http : //nutritiondata.self.com/ . Before intervention period , participant need complete questionnaire include demographic questionnaire , Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ ) Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) . The PHQ exclude healthy participant suffer psychiatry disorder ( ) analysis . The HADS , also complete intervention period , aim study effect probiotic anxiety depression level healthy participant especially IBS patient . Also , participant receive daily online questionnaire via email , include Positive Affect Negative Affect Scales , question level stress , consumption study capsule , hour sleep , IBS symptom quality life ( QoL ) ( last two patient ) , etc . Through questionnaire , investigator record menstruation information female participant control confounders . Also , gender age healthy patient group match much possible , since factor could effect GM composition CNS function . Stool sample collect day participant come lab visit measurement . The stool sample fresh possible , ideally collect morning visit day . Fresh sample store RNA synthesis stabilization buffer time collection . A centrifuged fecal pellet store -80° . Blood sample ( 10cc ) also take doctor University Hospital Tübingen participant finish experiment . The sample immediately send centrifuge 3500rpm 10 min separate serum . The sample store -80° analysis . During Magnetoencephalography measuring , Cyberball game , rest state session 5 minute . In session participant study supine position . Participants instruct move little possible remain awake , keep eye close . After rest state record Cyberball game start . The task game project screen participant ask fixate screen hold response box get ready task . Magnetic field measure 275-channel whole head magnetometer sample rate 1200 Hz . In order overlay brain activity derive MEG anatomical scan , high-resolution ( 1 mm , isotropic ) T1-weighted structural MR image acquire MPRAGE sequence 3-T MR scanner ( University Hospital Tübingen , Tübingen , Germany ) . Seventeen participant need experimental group , result least 85 study ( study 1 &amp; 2 ) . The recruitment participant organize MEG center responsibility Prof. Dr. Christoph Braun . The study announce black board Tübingen University Clinic campus University . Further announcement do via University mail list local newspaper . Each participant provide detailed information aim investigation , tasks measurement . Participants informed possibility cancel examination time without cause prejudice person . Investigation carry write consent participant obtain .</detailed_description>
