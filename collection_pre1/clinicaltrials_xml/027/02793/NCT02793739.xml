	<brief_summary>Fingers part body often subject increase sign age due physical use , trauma exposure environment . The FDA 's recent approval dermal filler , calcium hydroxylapatite , hand lead increased patient demand hand filler , turn , lead question rejuvenation dorsal finger . Due different anatomy finger dorsal hand plus new demand improve entire hand plus finger area , aim characterize best approach . Youthful finger devoid wrinkle often fuller contour thus hide `` knuckle '' ( proximal distal interphalangeal joint ) . With age loss subcutaneous tissue volume , finger become wrinkled , look skeletal , almost emaciate , joint become much prominent , aesthetic feature often dislike patient . By augment volume dorsal finger , possible visibility bony structure decrease , wrinkle become smoother , youthful appearance finger restore . There publish report , investigator ' knowledge , use injectable filler dorsal finger three-dimensional volume correction . The use exogenous hyaluronic acid ( HA ) filler finger would off-label . Given HA filler use safely effectively many area three-dimensional volume restoration throughout body , investigator believe HA filler may use effectively safely correct volume loss finger . The investigator hope study present current , state art , never report technique , safety , efficacy patient satisfaction HA filler region .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At Marmur Medical , subject recruit consented prior study evaluation procedure ; subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , participant enrol study . Informed consent clearly say use hyaluronic acid filler treatment dorsal finger volume loss investigational . Subjects also compensate visit ( initial six follow-ups total seven visit ) . Pre post treatment photograph take . Subjects give lidocaine cream apply area injection temporary numbing effect prior injection ( 10-15 minute ) . Ice pack also apply area temporarily numb effect prior injection . The patient 's finger inject 0.5-2.0 mL hyaluronic acid total level sub-dermal plane . The injected filler mold need optimize correction finger . Syringes use amount injected finger , well total per hand , document 0.1 mL increment ( e.g . 3.4 mL ) . The expected volume need 1-2 syrinx per subject initially . On Day 14 , subject return evaluation possible touch-up injectable hyaluronic acid filler need ( injector 's discretion ) . The expected volume need may 1-2 syrinx per subject touch-up . The subject return follow-up time-points follow : day 14 ( +/- touch-up hyaluronic acid injection necessary ) , 6 week , 3/6/9/12 month . The patient investigator ( ) ass volume enhancement finger . Subjects ask rate level satisfaction treatment follow-up visit ( Global Satisfaction Assessment , Natural Look/Feel Scale ) . In addition , initial visit , subject give 30 day diary fill evaluate symptomology injection ( pain , bruising , swell , redness , sensitivity/tenderness , itching , lumps/bump development , temporary numbness , sign vascular compromise other/open comment box ) . The subject diary collect 3 month follow-up visit . Statistical analysis data gather performed outside statistician use test Wilcoxian signed-rank test ( two observation ) Friedman 's test ( 2 observation ) use STAT , version 13 . All adverse event record every follow-up visit . These event include : redness , swell , tenderness , nodule development skin restrict range motion . More serious adverse event include : compartment syndrome , infection injection site , Tyndall effect , persistent granulomatous change , injection necrosis , persistent erythema edema , vascular occlusion cause symptom pain , numbness necrosis .</detailed_description>
