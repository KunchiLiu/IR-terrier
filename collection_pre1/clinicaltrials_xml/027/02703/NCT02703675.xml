	<brief_summary>Research show lower brain temperature may good result heart attack patient . Lowering brain temperature may promise treatment stroke patient . The Excel Cryo Cooling device drop brain temperature cool blood artery neck . The device neck collar cool pack shake reach low temperature within second . The collar place around patient 's neck cool pack apply front neck held place . This device provide stable cool irrespective participant size weight . The objective study test value use Excel Cryo Cooling device drop brain temperature 3 different group adult participant : . Healthy adult volunteer , ii . Adult participant normal body temperature intensive care unit iii . Adult participant fever intensive care unit</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness , Safety Ease Application Excel Cryo Cooling Collar Rapidly Reduce Core Brain Temperature</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate effectiveness , safety ease application Cryo Collar rapidly reduce core brain temperature , study recruit 8 healthy volunteer , 10 adult normothermic participant 10 adult sick febrile participant Neurocritical Care ICU The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center . Before place collar around participant 's neck , investigator record participant 's ear temperature heart rate baseline . An Excel Cryo Collar place around participant 's neck . After activate cool element , investigator place within neck collar . The participant 's ear temperature record every 5 minute . The investigator replace cool element every 20 minute continue record participant 's ear temperature every 5 minute . A total 6 cooling element use 2 hour . The heart rate blood pressure participant check record every 20 minute cool element replace . The participant 's bedside shiver assessment scale ( BSAS ) also record study . Five adult sick febrile participant receive 2 round cool procedure 2 hour long . The investigator analyze data gather study 2 different way : First , investigator run descriptive statistic three group participant find follow variable : Average temperature drop , average time mild therapeutic hypothermia change temperature end study . Second , investigator compare difference achieving temperature drop among three group compare mean value temperature drop three group .</detailed_description>
