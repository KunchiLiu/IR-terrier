	<brief_title>FoodnGo-Empower : A Feasibility Study Physical Activities Nutrition Older Patients Use Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Welfare health technology often direct solve problem meet needs society ' vulnerable group often familiar computer . The research innovation programme Food´n´Go - Empower aim develop , test implement health technology solution involvement increase empowerment elderly patient relative . The focus frequent issue group patient , phase focus nutrition physical activity . Later , solution include pain management , management sleep problem , medication management , prevention confusion coordination treatment care course across sectorial border . The technology tablet- computer , operate patient mean number app-like software application . In summer 2013 programme receive grant Capitol Region 's Public-Private-Innovation ( OPI ) pool design development prototype . In 2014 prototype nutrition test feasibility study . Usability acceptability test patient ' home , well effect nutrition intervention , discharge hospital ( see protocol 10/16/2014 ) . The result promising , aim test technology support nutrition physical activity across sectorial boundary . The elderly patient operate tablet admission discharge , continue effort aim nutrition physical activity stay rehabilitation centre 5 6 week discharge . The working hypothesis : Functional ability nutritional status stabilize improve , readmission dependency municipal service reduce . The aim study : 1. test adjust version Food´n´Go technology active involvement elderly patient prevent weight loss loss muscle strength hospitalization discharge 2. develop test technology relation stability , applicability acceptability</detailed_description>
