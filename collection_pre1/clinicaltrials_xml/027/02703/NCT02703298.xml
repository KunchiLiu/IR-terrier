	<criteria>1 . Tumor eligibility : Histologically cytologically confirm advanced , non resectable , and/or metastatic solid tumor refractory standard care therapy , standard care therapy available , amenable establish form treatment . 2 . Solid tumor must measurable evaluable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST v. 1.1 ) . Target lesion previously irradiate consider measurable ( lesion ) unless increase size observe follow completion radiation therapy . 3 . Female male , 20 year age old . 4 . ECOG performance status 0 2 . Resolution acute toxic effect prior therapy surgical procedure grade 1 ( except alopecia ) . 5 . Adequate organ function define follow criterion : Serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ) serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤3 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , AST ALT ≤5 x ULN liver function abnormality due underlying malignancy ; Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN ( except patient document Gilbert 's syndrome ) ; Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1500/µL ; Platelets &gt; = 90,000/µL ; Hemoglobin &gt; = 9.0 g/dL ; Serum creatinine ≤2.0 x ULN 6 . Signed date informed consent document indicate patient ( legally acceptable representative ) inform pertinent aspect trial prior enrollment . 7 . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . 1 . Patients leukemia , lymphomas , multiple myeloma , type hematologic cancer . 2 . Major surgery , radiation therapy , systemic anticancer therapy within 4 week start study treatment . 3 . Prior highdose chemotherapy require hematopoietic stem cell rescue . 4 . Current treatment another clinical trial . 5 . Brain metastasis , spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis , leptomeningeal disease unless appropriately treat neurologically stable least 4 week . 6 . Any follow within 12 month prior start study treatment : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident include transient ischemic attack ; within 6 month prior start study treatment pulmonary embolus . However , upon agreement investigator sponsor , 6 month posteventfree period patient pulmonary embolus waive due advanced cancer . Appropriate treatment anticoagulant permit . 7 . Hypertension control medication ( &gt; 150/100 mmHg despite optimal medical therapy ) . 8 . Current treatment therapeutic dos warfarin ( low dose warfarin 2 mg PO daily deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis allow ) . 9 . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive receive antiretroviral therapy . 10 .
