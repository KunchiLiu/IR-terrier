	<brief_summary>This study aim examine role weight gain adipose tissue immune cell influx development obesity relate cardiometabolic disorder . Adipose tissue-mediated chronic systemic inflammation implicate development cardiometabolic disorder obesity . Therefore , resolution adipose tissue inflammation may key ameliorate obesity-associated dyslipidemia , insulin-resistance , cardiovascular disease . Proinflammatory cytokine contribute initial influx immune cell adipose tissue weight gain . However , mechanism regulate cytokine adipose tissue milieu effect weight gain adipose tissue completely understood . The study propose investigate molecular event contribute increase infiltration macrophages T-cells adipose tissue weight gain . The central hypothesis lean subject ( low body fat mass ) , healthy fat gain associate decreased expression proinflammatory cytokine . However , obesity ( high body fat mass ) , adipose tissue alter , permit increase expression inflammatory cytokine fat gain result influx immune cell . To test hypothesis , adipose tissue well characterize lean ( control , low body fat ) obese individual ( high body fat ) baseline modest 5 % weight gain use . Adipose tissue sample subsequent weight loss also examine . For study , obesity define body composition rather body mass index ( BMI ) , several study show BMI adequately define obesity several individual normal BMI may indeed high body fat mass . Individuals body fat content ≤25 % men , &amp; &lt; 35 % woman ) consider lean individual body fat content &gt; 25 % men , ≥35 % woman consider obese .</brief_summary>
