	<brief_title>Endoscopic Treatment Difficult Bile Duct Stones : Spyglass + EHL x Balloon Dilation Papilla</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before enrollment patient study , two investigator , EGHM TAPF , perform 10 complete case ERCP ( Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ) + SPYGLASS + EHL , get experience method . This comparative study method , prospective , randomize study assess successful removal bile duct stone consider difficult two propose method . A total 100 patient recruit , accord criterion inclusion / exclusion Appendix I. Randomization perform use computer generate system . Fifty patient distribute group 1 ( Spyglass + electrohydraulic lithotripsy ) fifty group 2 ( hydrostatic balloon dilation papilla extractor balloon sweep ) . Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) perform , diagnosis difficult stone , follow randomization two propose method . In group 1 , examination Direct Visualization System Bile Ducts ( `` Spyglass Direct Visualization System '' ) hold soon diagnosis difficult stone partial endoscopic papillotomy . After access biliary duct system describe , visualization stone , introduce gently work channel spyglass probe perform electrohydraulic lithotripsy . When fragmentation complete system spyglass remove piece stone remove conventional endoscopic method . In group 2 , diagnosis difficult calculus perform partial endoscopic papillotomy , papilla ( papillotomy ) dilate hydrostatic balloon maximum size allow diameter common bile duct , follow scan extractor balloon . In group , stone clearance confirm use Spyglass cholangioscopic exploration bile duct . In case failure stone removal method study , perform biliary drainage plastic stent .</detailed_description>
