This require individual/child parent attend clinical facility fast require trained health care professional take venous sample , analyse interpret result . There also problem encounter standardise test . The patient fast must travel clinic test morning . The OGTT , do hospital , therefore affect individual 's time work , time school , cause inconvenience expensive individual , parent child travel clinic . The unpredictability workload hospital staff mean test time often strictly adhere accurately record . In patient cystic fibrosis also additional risk cross infection attend hospital OGTT . These factor limit uptake OGTTs screen child cystic fibrosis . To overcome issue simple , disposable , self-administered electronic OGTT Kit contain everything require perform OGTT home simple write pictorial instruction use study . The aim study establish self-administered electronic Oral Glucose Tolerance Test kit increase annual uptake screen CFRD child 10 17 year age CF .</detailed_description>
