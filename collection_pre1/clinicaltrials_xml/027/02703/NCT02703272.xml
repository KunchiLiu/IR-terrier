	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Ibrutinib Pediatric Young Adult Participants With Relapsed Refractory Mature B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , randomize ( study medication assign participant chance ) , open-label ( identity study drug know participant study staff ) , control study consist two part : Part 1 Part 2 . The Part 1 pharmacokinetic run-in part , conduct start randomized part ( Part 2 ) study Part 2 randomize open-label study . Part 1 Part 2 study conduct 3 phase : Pretreatment ( Screening ) Phase ( Up 14 day administration study drug ) , Treatment Phase , Posttreatment Phase . The Treatment Phase extend enrollment ( Part 1 ) randomization ( Part 2 ) 1 follow : 1 ) completion 3 cycle therapy , 2 ) transplantation , clinically indicate , 3 ) progressive disease ( PD ) , whichever come first . The Posttreatment Phase continue death , loss follow , consent withdrawal , study end , whichever occur first . The end study define approximately 60 event-free survival ( EFS ) event occur Part 2 ( death , disease progression , lack complete response [ CR ] partial response [ PR ] 3 cycle treatment base blind independent event review ) , sponsor terminates study , whichever come first . Participants Part 1 1 less ( &lt; ) 18 year old . Participants Part 2 1 30 year old . Participants primarily evaluate pharmacokinetics part 1 efficacy ( EFS ) ibrutinib combination RICE RVICI background therapy compare RICE RVICI background therapy alone part 2 . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
