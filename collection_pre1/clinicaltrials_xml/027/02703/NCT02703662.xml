	<detailed_description>Complex abdominal wall reconstruction utilize advanced technique include , limited , component separation , modify component separation , free tissue flap reconstruction . Data suggest recurrence rate lower insertion mesh support material . More specifically , synthetic mesh utilization repair simple clean ventral hernia reduces hernia recurrence 50 % compare suture closure alone . Unfortunately presence microbial contamination infection , mark increase hernia recurrence mesh infection use synthetic prosthesis . Biologic mesh however establish option use abdominal wall reconstruction presence field contamination infection . These indication , well others , biologic material include , limited , patient chronic immunosuppression , infect field , colonize field ( i.e . precede synthetic mesh ) , need place product within peritoneal cavity ( underlay ) , patient complex loss domain . It also note may significant utility use biologic material much broad range indication , economic cost product clearly tempored wide indication overall use . To date , prospective randomize controlled trial compare various biologic mesh material context abdominal wall reconstruction . As result , proposal describes 'head head ' randomize control trial ( RCT ) 2 market 's popular biologic mesh . Strattice ( noncross-linked porcine dermis , LifeCell Inc. ) compare Permacol ( cross-linked porcine dermis , Covidien Inc. ) randomize manner . Although significant difference mesh product regard procurement , tissue processing cost , clinical control trial need compare performance . Given nearly 2-fold difference cost 2 include biologic mesh , equivalence regard recurrence postoperative complication would represent massive economic saving public health care system .</detailed_description>
