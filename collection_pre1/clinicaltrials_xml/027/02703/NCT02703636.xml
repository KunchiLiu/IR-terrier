	<criteria>1 . Outpatient status baseline . 2 . Males , female childbearing potential ( surgically sterile , one year last menses ) . 3 . A diagnosis dementia Alzheimer 's type accord DSMIV criterion . 4 . A clinical diagnosis probable AD accord National Institute Neurological Communicative Disorders Stroke Alzheimer 's Disease Related Disorders Association ( NINCDSADRDA ) criterion . 5 . Brain scan ( magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] , compute tomography [ CT ] ) meet diagnosis criterion conduct within 3 year prior baseline . 6 . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) meet diagnosis criterion conduct within 3 year prior baseline visit , long past brain scan ( MRI CT ) also meet . 7 . MMSE score ≥ 10 ≤ 23 screen baseline . 8 . Patients currently oral monotherapy ( donepezil , 5 mg ) , galantamine ( 1624 mg ) 4 week prior baseline visit . 9 . Patients fail receive enough treatment benefit previous treatment define patient meet least one follow condition screen baseline ( multiple choice allow ) 10 . Patients decline ≥ 2 point MMSE despite treatment oral Cholinesterase ( ChE ) inhibitor initial 3month . 11 . Patients decline ≥2 point MMSE last 6 month oral ChE inhibitor ( ChEI ) . 12 . Patients show marked worsening BPSD , ADL ( define 1 state progression FAST ) judge physician despite treatment oral ChE inhibitor initial 3month last 6month oral ChE inhibitor 13 . Patients difficulty treat orally ChEIs ( donepezil galantamine ) physician 's judgement . 14 . Poor compliance adverse event except GI symptoms 15 . Patients swallow difficulty . 1 . Any medical neurological condition AD could explain patient 's dementia ( e.g. , abnormal thyroid function test , vitamin B12 folate deficiency , posttraumatic condition , syphilis , head injury , Huntington 's disease , Parkinson 's disease , subdural hematoma , normal pressure hydrocephalus , brain tumor ) baseline 2 . Any DSMIV Axis 1 diagnosis may interfere evaluation patient 's response study medication , include primary neurodegenerative dementia , schizophrenia , bipolar disorder 3 . An advanced , severe , progressive , unstable disease type may interfere efficacy safety assessment put patient special risk 4 . Current diagnosis active skin lesion/disorder 5 . Patients history hypersensitivity ingredient rivastigmine carbamate derivative 6 . Each patient require primary caregiver willing accept responsibility supervise treatment , assess patient 's condition throughout study , provide input efficacy assessment . Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply .</criteria>
