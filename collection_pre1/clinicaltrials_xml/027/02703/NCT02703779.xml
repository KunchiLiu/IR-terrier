	<brief_title>Exploratory Trial Estimate Proportion Patients With Tumor Cell Contaminated Leukapheresis Products With Without Bortezomib With In-vivo Purging - Multiple Myeloma ( MM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplant result improved overall survival currently consider effective first line therapy applicable majority patient multiple myeloma . However disease relapse inevitable remain primary cause mortality cohort . The purpose study estimate proportion subject plasma cell contamination harvest stem cell product standard treatment arm . The study explore whether in-vivo purge malignant tumor plasma cell improve progression free survival ( PFS ) patient . The study consist two group : Group A : Standard Care ( SOC ) stem cell collection without in-vivo purging bortezomib . Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) Mozobil use need . Group B : Bortezomib 1.3mg/m^2 give subcutaneously ( SQ ) day -11 -8 follow Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) day -4 -1 prior stem cell harvest ( day 0 ) .</detailed_description>

Ability understand , willingness sign write Informed Consent Form Diagnosis multiple myeloma undergoing plan autologous stem cell transplantation Age ≥ 18 year Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) 70 , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0 , 1 2 Adequate organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥ 3,000/micro Liter ( mcL ) absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL platelet ≥ 100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit NOTE : For study , subject bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) exclude enrollment study . Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) ( Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase [ SGOT ] ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) ( Serum Pyruvic Glutamic Transaminase [ SPGT ] ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit Women childbearing potential men partner childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 30 day follow completion therapy . Should woman partner become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician investigator immediately . A woman childbearing potential female ( regardless sexual orientation , undergone tubal ligation , remain celibate choice ) meet follow criterion : Has undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; Has naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) Subjects meet exclusion criterion baseline exclude study participation . Current anticipated use investigational agent . NOTE follow clarification study : Prohibited Concurrent Therapy : Participation clinical trial investigational agent include trial , within 14 day start trial 2 week participant receive last dose bortezomib mobilization . Hypersensitivity bortezomib , boron mannitol Granulocyte colonystimulating factor ( GCSF ) Subject receive &gt; 6 month lenalidomide ( Revlimid® ) therapy prior stem cell collection Subject know brain metastasis . Presence brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis patient often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Grade 3 high peripheral neuropathy Bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection symptomatic congestive heart failure unstable angina pectoris cardiac arrhythmia psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Pregnant nursing : There potential congenital abnormality regimen harm nursing infant .</criteria>
