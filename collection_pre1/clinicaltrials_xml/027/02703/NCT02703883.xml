	<brief_title>Body Weight Support Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The individual participate study subject SCI twelve month evolution . All classify incomplete injury class C D accord American Spinal Injury Association ( ASIA ) . Each receive training BWST six week . Two measure stance balance perform training protocol . The first measure make enter training protocol ; final measure implement gait train BWST protocol complete . For instrumented stance balance testing , small wireless inertial motion sensor ( OPAL sensor , APDM Inc. , Portland , OR ) place subject ' waist . Subjects perform instrumented stance eye open ( iSway ) . Outcome measure record automatically generate use Mobility Lab software ( APDM Inc. , Portland , OR ) . Measures include root mean square sway jerk ( normalized range acceleration amplitude ) .</detailed_description>
