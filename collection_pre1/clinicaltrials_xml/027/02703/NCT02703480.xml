	<detailed_description>E ) Study Procedures Visit 1 : Screening ( Approximately 30 min ) Informed consent obtain principal investigator co-investigator . The subject instruct read inform consent form ( ICF ) , give ample time question answer , instructed sign ICF . Subject give copy ICF . Subject ask complete demographic information medical history . Inclusion/exclusion criterion evaluate . The pre-operative height bony crest evaluate pre-existing radiograph refer clinic le 6 month old . If recent radiograph exist , radiographs take visit . It standard care radiograph within past 6 month prior surgery . Visit 2 : Surgery ( Approximately 180 min ) Medical history review standard care . Eligibility subject withdrawal criterion review ensure subject still qualify study . Surgeries perform either two investigator , Yong Hur ( Co-I ) Yumi Ogata ( PI ) . The use d-PTFE vertical ridge augmentation randomly assign one side mouth subject ( randomization research purpose ) Ti-mesh side mouth , therefore , subject receive follow procedure : - Guided Bone regeneration ( GBR ) procedure use d-PTFE : ( standard care exclude clinical measurement ) The following step perform follow standard care procedure : local anesthesia , muco-periosteal incision , full thickness flap reflection , de-cortication alveolar ridge , bone harvest use bone scraper , tent screw placement , clinical measurement , DBBM graft material placement , placement stabilization d-PTFE membrane accord manufacturer 's instruction , suture . - Guided Bone regeneration ( GBR ) procedure use Ti-mesh : ( standard care exclude clinical measurement ) The following step perform follow standard care procedure : local anesthesia , muco-periosteal incision , full thickness flap reflection , de-cortication alveolar ridge , bone harvest use bone scraper , tent screw placement , clinical measurement , DBBM graft material placement , placement stabilization titanium mesh accord manufacturer 's instruction , suture . Bone harvest use bone scraper perform GBR procedure technique ( d-PTFE Ti-mesh ) . Bone harvest use bone scraper harvest particulate autogeneous bone graft material . The investigator use mixture 50:50 DBBM autogenous bone graft material vertical augmentation procedure study . Particulate autogenous bone graft harvest retromolar region mandible . This area next area GBR procedure ( posterior mandible ) visible flap elevation vertical augmentation . Therefore , investigator need additional step except harvest autogenous bone graft . Intraoral harvest bone scraper retromolar region simple safe method collect cortical bone chip . The intrasurgical clinical measurement ridge height take surgery . The distance top tenting screw bone crest measure periodontal probe procedure . Duration procedure surgical complication include flap tear bleeding collect . All outcome measurement perform Co-I perform surgery . The subject ask complete pain/discomfort survey use VAS scale zero ten . A medication log give patient track number pill prescribe painkiller take order examine amount pain surgical procedure . The mean number pill use surgical procedure analyze . Post-operative medication prescribe follow TUSDM standard care guideline . Visit 3 ( 7±3 day procedure ) : Post-operative Follow-up ( Approximately 20 min ) Medical history review standard care . Eligibility subject withdrawal criterion review ensure subject still qualify study . Each subject post-operative visit , standard practice TUSDM periodontology clinic . Standard care procedure include suture removal evaluation surgical site perform . For research , information regard bleeding , presence infection , bruising , and/or complication collect . Each subject complete survey evaluate level pain/discomfort , bleeding , swell follow surgical procedure side - classify VAS scale zero ten . In addition , subject return complete medication log . Visit 4 ( 21±3 day procedure ) : Post-operative Follow-up ( Approximately 20 min ) Medical history review standard care . Eligibility subject withdrawal criterion review ensure subject still qualify study . Each subject post-operative visit , standard practice TUSDM periodontology clinic . Standard care procedure include suture removal evaluation surgical site perform . For research , information regard bleeding , presence infection , bruising , and/or complication collect . Each subject complete survey evaluate level pain/discomfort , bleeding , swell follow surgical procedure side - classify VAS scale zero ten . Follow-up visit six month post-operative period vertical ridge augmentation surgery schedule . Standard care procedure evaluation complete follow-up visit . The surgical site evaluate vertical ridge augmentation procedure , order ass presence postoperative complication , exposure d-PTFE membrane Ti-mesh , infection , swell , paresthesia complication . All note subject 's axiUm record review time Visit 4 . Visit 5 ( 6±1 month Visit 4 ) : Evaluation visit ( Approximately 20 min ) Medical history review standard care . Eligibility subject withdrawal criterion review ensure subject still qualify study . Surgical site evaluate subject 's axiUm record review complication . Each subject complete survey evaluate level pain/discomfort , bleeding , swell follow surgical procedure side - classify VAS scale zero ten , Visit 3 . Radiographs take . It standard care radiograph take prior implant placement . The post-operative ( vertical GBR augmentation procedure ) height bony crest evaluate radiograph take part standard care . Visit 6 ( Up 1 month Visit 5 ) : Bone core harvesting , implant placement visit ( Approximately 120 min ) Medical history review standard care . Eligibility subject withdrawal criterion review ensure subject still qualify study . The subject present regularly schedule implant placement . The following step perform follow standard care procedure : local anesthesia , muco-periosteal incision , full thickness flap reflection , membrane ( Ti-mesh/d-PTFE ) removal , clinical measurement , tent screw removal , bone core harvesting , implant osteotomy , implant placement , suture . The intrasurgical clinical measurement ridge height take implant placement surgery . The distance top tenting screw bone crest measure periodontal probe procedure . The bone height gain calculate subtract second measurement form first measurement ( take initial surgery ) . At time implant placement bone core harvest site implant location histological analysis . For bone sample study , hollow ( trephine ) bur , rather solid bur , use allow sample . A trephine bur 3-4 mm diameter use . The core size exceed amount bone removal require designated implant . Removal bone standard implant placement order create space fixture . The bone core biopsy place fixative label subject ID . The collected bone sample place alcohol storage store basic science laboratory DHS-635 . The implant placement consider part study . After Visit 6 - Laboratory analysis bone core sample Histological slide prepare histomorphometric analysis perform commercial laboratory ( CBSET ) . The sample cod subject number histological analysis blind . All collect bone core sample ship laboratory ( CBSET ) Yumi Ogata ( PI ) Yong Hur ( Co-I ) . Histomorphometric measurement tissue fraction ( DBBM , autogenous bone , newly form bone marrow and/or connective tissue ) perform grafted area . The section digitally photograph computerized software .</detailed_description>
