	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether role measure Hydrogen Sulphide ( H2S ) exhale breath term management patient asthma . The investigator recruit patient range severity asthma health volunteer . Levels Hydrogen Sulphide measure exhaled breath blood . Also exhale Nitric Oxide , Spirometry asthma symptom score measure study visit . Participants attend either 2 4 separate visit . The investigator determine whether relationship exhale Hydrogen Sulphide asthma severity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . Perform cross-sectional study non-asthmatic subject asthmatic subject vary severity level Hydrogen Sulphide exhale breath relation severity control asthma 2 . Compare level exhale Hydrogen Sulphide exhale Nitric Oxide . We recruit 30 health volunteer 90 patient range severity asthma . Particpants attend either 2 4 visit . At visit follow measurement take : 1 . Exhaled Hydrogen Sulphide 2 . Serum Hydrogen Sulphide 2 . Exhaled Nitric Oxide 3 . Spirometry 4 . Asthma Symptom Score ( ACQ ) The investigator use Hydrogen Sulphide UV fluorescent machine Model T101 ( 0-50 ppb 0-20 ppm ) ( Cal-Bay Control Inc , USA ) measure directly line exhale breath Hydrogen Sulphide . This method use previously normal people , first determine whether exhaled flow-dependence measurement H2S level . The investigator use hand-held Nitric Oxide machine ( NO Breath ) measure Nitric Oxide exhale breath . Subjects must asthma accord one follow criterion document last 12 month : 1 . Improvement FEV1 ( forced expiratory volume one second ) ≥ 12 % 200ml predict inhalation 400 mcg salbutamol 2 . Airway hyper-responsiveness ( PC20 &lt; 8mg/ml ) 3 . Diurnal variation PEF ( peak expiratory flow ) : amplitude % mean twice daily PEF &gt; 8 % 4 . Decrease pre-bronchodilator FEV1 &gt; 12 % &gt; 200mls within 4 week taper treatment one follow drug : inhaled corticosteroid , oral corticosteroid , long-acting beta-agonists , long-acting beta-agonists short-acting beta-agonists . PLUS A history wheeze occur spontaneously exertion</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient must able give informed consent . The definition severity asthma accord GINA ( Global Initiative Asthma ) guideline dependent amount therapy need control asthma . The investigator also include least 45 patient severe asthma defined basis : Uncontrolled asthma : three follow feature present week previous 4 week : Daytime symptom twice per week Any limitation activity Nocturnal symptom per week Need reliever treatment twice per week Pre bronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict personal best OR Frequent severe exacerbation ( ≥2 per year ) OR Require prescription daily alternate day oral corticosteroid ( OCS ) achieve asthma control despite prescription high dose inhale corticosteroid ( &gt; 1000mcg fluticasone propionate daily equivalent ) maintenance oral corticosteroid plus long acting beta agonist one controller medication ( example anticholinergic , leukotriene receptor antagonist theophylline ) . Diagnosis asthma asthma cohort : Subjects must asthma accord one follow criterion document last 12 month improvement FEV1 ≥ 12 % 200ml predict inhalation 400 mcg salbutamol airway hyperresponsiveness ( PC20 &lt; 8mg/ml ) diurnal variation PEF : amplitude % mean twice daily PEF &gt; 8 % decrease pre bronchodilator FEV1 &gt; 12 % &gt; 200mls within 4 week taper treatment one follow drug : inhaled corticosteroid , oral corticosteroid , longacting betaagonists , longacting betaagonists shortacting betaagonists . PLUS history wheeze occur spontaneously exertion Current smoker , Exsmoker &gt; 10 year pack history smoke within past 6 month . Significant alternative diagnosis may mimic complicate asthma , particular dysfunctional breathing , panic attack , overt psychosocial problem ( thought major problem rather addition severe asthma ) Significant primary pulmonary disorder particular pulmonary embolism , pulmonary hypertension , interstitial lung disease lung cancer Subjects emphysema bronchiectasis exclude thought major pulmonary disorder rather addition severe asthma Diagnosis current investigation occupational asthma Any subject currently participate , participate within 3 month first dose study use new molecular entity , first dose study investigate drug .</criteria>
