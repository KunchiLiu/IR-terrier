	<detailed_description>The LUCY Study prospective , consecutively enrol , non-randomized multi center post-market study evaluate Ovation Abdominal Platform use endovascular treatment female patient . The primary endpoint freedom access-related vascular complication freedom AAA-related mortality 30 day . Secondary endpoint study achieve demonstrate benefit female patient despite fact historically few female patient eligible EVAR , experience high rate access-related complication high mortality rate . Secondary endpoint evaluate 1 year ( 365 ± 60 day ) post-procedure .</detailed_description>
