	<brief_title>Image-Guided Stereotactic Radiosurgery ( SRS ) Boost HPV-Oropharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) frequently find within tumor cell remove patient diagnosed oropharynx cancer . Tumors contain HPV virus ( term `` HPV-Negative '' ) cure frequently radiation therapy . Tumors contain HPV patient history cigarette smoking also cure frequently radiation . One way potentially overcome challenge deliver intense dose radiation treatment tumor . The standard way deliver radiation , term Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy ( IMRT ) , protect normal tissue near tumor certain degree completely . Stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) technique deliver radiation precisely . This trial test safety treat HPV-unassociated oropharynx tumor high radiation dose wth SRS ( term `` boost '' ) standard course IMRT give . In addition , investigator look whether magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan detect treatment response oropharynx tumor earlier standard test .</detailed_description>
