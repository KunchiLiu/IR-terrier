	<detailed_description>Two recent study show two attend spine surgeon perform complex adult spine deformity surgery instead one , decrease complication , unplanned surgery within 30-days [ Ames ] , 90-day readmission , wound infection , pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis post-operative neurologic complication [ Sethi ] . However , study retrospective evaluate cost-savings associate two spine surgeon instead one perform complex spine deformity surgery . With increase scrutiny efficient use health care dollar , would important determine downstream cost saving justify pay surgeon fee two spine attending complex high cost case . Most cost-effectiveness study use traditional accounting ( TA ) method determine cost . TA use allocate expense general ledger payroll activity code . These code derive billable item procedure enter accounting software . Costs service group cost type , across unit service . A cost-effectiveness study use time-driven activity-based costing ( TDABC ) [ Kaplan ] medicine [ Au , Balakrishnan ] none spine surgery . TDABC allow detailed identification cost phase patient 's care cycle . While TDABC use industry , use describe time health care rarely operative set [ Balakrishnan ] . This may due large amount manpower necessary collect TDABC data . Objectives : The objective study ( 1 ) determine dual spine attending reduce downstream cost compare single spine attend complex spine surgery use traditional accounting method ; ( 2 ) demonstrate application TDABC method evaluate operating room phase complex adult spinal deformity surgery compare traditional accounting method ( TA ) .</detailed_description>
