	<brief_summary>Various center around world currently investigate feasibility yield surveillance pancreatic cancer high-risk individual . Evidence begin accumulate surveillance may lead early detection non-invasive precursor lesion asymptomatic early stage cancer . Ultimately , goal surveillance reduce mortality high risk individual , confirm many research question need answer . While number high-risk individual screen separate screening facility likely small properly address many question , pool data comprises sizable sample size provide unique research opportunity . The objective study retrospectively review case high-risk individual participate pancreatic surveillance program 1 ) suspicious precursor lesion detect pancreatic resection perform 2 ) advance malignant disease diagnose . The de-identified information enter international multicenter database registry .</brief_summary>
