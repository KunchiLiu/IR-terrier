	<brief_summary>The purpose investigator ' study ass efficacy single dose preoperative gabapentin within enhanced recovery surgery protocol acute postoperative pain reduction woman undergo minimally invasive hysterectomy . Participants consent participate randomize either control group without gabapentin study arm receive gabapentin 600 mg prior plan surgery . The investigator collect data postoperative narcotic use , subjective pain rat numeric pain scale , addition adverse effect single dose gabapentin use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Dose Preoperative Gabapentin Use Minimally Invasive Hysterectomy Acute Pain Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multimodal postoperative analgesia hysterectomy mainly base combination nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug opioids . However , adverse effect include nausea , vomit , sedation , pruritus may limit use opioids . As side effect dose relate , minimize opioid exposure may significantly reduce risk . Thus , interest evaluate preemptive well post-operative administration non-opioids . Additional regimen suggest minimize opioid use associate adverse effect include injection local anesthetic , epidural analgesia , anticonvulsant , gabapentin pregabalin . Gabapentin , widely use anticonvulsant use treatment neuropathic pain , recently suggest improve postoperative analgesia reduce opioid requirement . Gabapentin think modulate calcium channel presynaptic nociceptive neuron , turn modulate inhibit release excitatory neurotransmitter activate nociceptors . In addition inhibit pain transmission , gabapentin may exert analgesic effect activate descend inhibitory noradrenergic pathway . Many study demonstrate safety efficacy gabapentin perioperative use variety procedure across discipline include thoracotomy , laparoscopic cholecystectomy , tonsillectomy , major orthopedic surgery , cesarean section , abdominal hysterectomy . Several randomized trial evaluate effect gabapentin administer preoperatively well give pre- postoperatively hysterectomy . In systematic review 14 study conduct 2004 2013 , sample range 40 200 , investigator identify 8 trial gabapentin administer preoperatively reduce pain associate abdominal hysterectomy surgery . Analysis data clearly demonstrate preemptive gabapentin reduce postoperative visual analog scale ( VAS ) pain score approximately 50 % postoperative use morphine approximately 37 % . The incidence pruritus dry mouth receive preemptive gabapentin appear similar receiving placebo , however high rate report dizziness ( statistically significant ) associate gabapentin . In contrast , multiple postoperative dos gabapentin addition preoperative dose find significant effect VAS score 24 hour , thus favor single preoperative dose . Although initial result encouraging , uptake gabapentin routine clinical use remain limited due mixed result variability gabapentin protocol , include dose duration . Christiana Care Health System ( CCHS ) plan implement Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS ) protocol administers preoperative medication reduce postoperative pain , include acetaminophen , celecoxib , dexamethasone , gabapentin . Therefore aim study ass efficacy single dose preoperative gabapentin protocol reduce acute postoperative pain woman undergo minimally invasive hysterectomy .</detailed_description>
