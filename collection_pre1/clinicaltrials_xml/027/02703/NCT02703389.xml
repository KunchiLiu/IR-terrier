	<brief_summary>The amount speed emergency department ( ED ) discharge instruction often make difficult patients/caregivers know final diagnosis remember instruction . We hypothesize video ear infection antibiotic ' role management facilitate caregiver understanding increase likelihood caregiver properly follow discharge instruction . To verify hypothesis , large multi-centre clinical trial need . Prior , ethical conduct small 'pilot ' trial . Previously healthy child ( 6 months-5 year ) diagnose mild ear infection McMaster Children 's Hospital ED eligible participate . If child caregiver decide participate , discharge , caregiver either : 1 ) watch aforementioned video , 2 ) give pamphlet information , 3 ) standard care ( additional information ) . Participants fill knowledge survey discharge . The research assistant contact participant phone determine caregiver follow discharge instruction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As acute otitis medium case self-resolve , observation initial management mild acute otitis medium ( AOM ) recommend Canadian American authority . However , North American child receive antibiotic AOM reason , make AOM-related prescribing key focus antimicrobial stewardship intervention . Low uptake ED suggest management strategy may cause caregiver under-appreciation antibiotic-associated harm problem understand discharge plan , could remedied novel video-based knowledge translation platform . The aim pilot study determine feasibility follow-up large trial . The main clinical research question : caregiver previously healthy child age 6-59 month diagnose ED physician acute otitis medium judge eligible watchful wait approach , use innovative informative video lead lower rate unnecessary antibiotic use compare pamphlet intervention ( reference standard ) ? This single-centre , randomize , control , pilot trial . Caregivers previously well child age 6-59 month present McMaster Children 's Hospital ( MCH ) ED non-severe AOM eligible watchful wait approach enrol randomized video intervention , pamphlet intervention , standard care ( intervention ) . The primary outcome proportion caregiver fill prescription antimicrobial &lt; 48 hour recruitment , caregiver generally advise wait 48-72 hour prior administer antibiotic healthy child mild AOM .</detailed_description>
