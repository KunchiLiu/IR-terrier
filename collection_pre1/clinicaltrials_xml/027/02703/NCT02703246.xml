In minimally invasive gynecologic surgery small incision make abdomen pelvis hysterectomy perform laparoscopy . The challenge remove uterus , may quite large , small incision . One option morcellate uterus remove tissue either small abdominal incision incision vagina . When organ morcellated cut small piece remove , section section , small incision . The investigator compare two method tissue removal see whether one result well surgical outcome increase intra-operative post-operative complication . The primary outcome time take perform surgery ( operative time ) . Secondary surgical outcome study include amount blood lose surgery , post-operative complication , readmission hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tissue Removal During Hysterectomy : The Effect Vaginal Versus Abdominal Morcellation Surgical Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hysterectomy commonly perform non-obstetric procedure woman United States , approximately 400,000 hysterectomy perform year . Minimally invasive technique show advantage laparotomy . These include decreased blood loss , fast recovery time , improve postoperative pain decrease postoperative complication include wound infection , thromboembolism , iatrogenic injury incisional hernia . Due benefit , volume minimally invasive procedure increase significantly last ten year make tissue extraction widely debate topic . Morcellation technique allow large piece tissue remove small incision originally perform either scalpel manual device first power/electric morcellators introduce 1993 . Since , power morcellation make 50,000 150,000 minimally invasive hysterectomy possible annually . While former integral part treatment woman large uteri uterine fibroid , recently come scrutiny due multiple concern include dissemination undetected malignancy , development iatrogenic myoma well increased number report complication death . This lead US Food drug administration April 2014 issue statement discourage use laparoscopic power morcellation . In face grow bias electronic mechanical morcellators , approach must investigate promulgated patient may still benefit minimally invasive gynecologic surgery . The two commonly use method tissue extraction manual morcellation mini-laparotomy vaginal morcellation . In former , trocar site enlargement new 1 inch incision create specimen bring abdominal surface morcellated scalpel.In latter , tissue remove fashion via colpotomy . The investigator intent compare manual morcellation method ( vaginal v abdominal mini-laparotomy ) order help surgeon choose best approach patient .</detailed_description>
