	<detailed_description>Mobile platform leverage variety industry drive dramatic efficiency gain . The technology enable redesign key process allow efficient use labor capital lead good performance outcome . Telehealth use electronic information mobile telecommunication technology support long-distance clinical health care , patient professional health-related education , public health health administration . Much focus Institute Medicine government agency application telehealth improve access healthcare specialized expertise extend reach scarce resource underserved population . These platform also routinely deploy disease management tool . A natural extension aim use telehealth clinical development process , improve efficiency ability inclusive broader patient population critical step modernize clinical trial . REINVENT non-interventional , multi-center , research network-based cross-over study evaluate potential utility telehealth platform improve efficiency clinical trial . The study aim enroll 30 subject 9 11 qualified Radiant Clinical Research primary care physician ( PCP ) , coordinate single main study site . Potential subject screen randomize ( 1:1 ) Visit 1 2-period crossover design study 4 standard cognitive outcome measure administer Visits 2 ( Day 30 ±7 ) 3 ( Day 90 ±7 ) , either remotely in-person visit . A 60-day interval require Visits 2 3 reduce learn effect commonly observe repeated administration cognitive assessment .</detailed_description>
