	<brief_summary>The main purpose study explore impact amyloid positron emission tomography compute tomography ( PET/CT ) scan physician diagnosis management , include drug management care practice , patient diagnosis cognitive impairment . This study also intend capture specific patient-reported outcome related patient burden , confidence satisfaction . The hypothesis aid early diagnosis , individual diagnostically uncertain etiology dementia benefit knowledge amyloid plaque burden status , alteration patient diagnosis management , lead significant change patient care partner report outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary purpose prospective , observational study examine benefit [ 18F ] Flutemetamol PET/CT scan clinical practice early diagnosis cognitive impairment identify Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) pathology . To accomplish , clinician order amyloid positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan , investigator assess impact [ 18F ] Flutemetamol PET/CT scan 1 ) physician diagnosis management relate care practice drug management , 2 ) patient report outcomes patient evaluate Cognitive Disorders Clinic University Utah meeting Appropriate Use Criteria ( AUC ) clinical amyloid PET/CT scan . A secondary purpose compare semi-quantitative assessment amyloid plaque burden use vendor supply software standard visual assessment amyloid positivity . The primary hypothesis , diagnostically uncertain case , knowledge amyloid status determine amyloid PET/CT scan may alter patient diagnosis management lead significant change patient family report outcomes . A secondary hypothesis vendor supply semi-quantitative assessment amyloid plaque positivity superior standard visual criterion assessment . Aims : Aim 1 : To assess change diagnosis management include care practice drug management adult patient evaluate cognitive deficit meet Appropriate Use Criteria ( AUC ) . Aim 2 : To assess change amyloid PET/CT scan patient-reported outcome involve care partner confidence satisfaction . Aim 3 : To assess confidence visual interpretation use vendor supply semi-quantitative software ass amyloid plaque burden . Hypotheses Tested - Synopsis The hypothesis aid early diagnosis , individual diagnostically uncertain etiology dementia benefit knowledge amyloid plaque burden status alteration patient diagnosis management , lead significant change patient care partner report outcome . Aim 1 1 . Amyloid PET change physician judgment likelihood AD 2 . Amyloid PET change lead diagnosis 25 % case 3 . Amyloid PET increase physician diagnostic confidence lead diagnosis 4 . Amyloid PET change 25 % care practice option pre-scan management 5 . Amyloid PET change 25 % drug management option Aim 2 1 . Care partner confident diagnosis scan scan 2 . Care partner satisfy multidisciplinary cognitive specialty team evaluation previous evaluation 3 . Care partner satisfy multidisciplinary cognitive specialty team evaluation amyloid PET evaluation non-specialists perform without amyloid PET 4 . Care partner find amyloid PET burdensome doctor find scan helpful 5 . Based upon experience amyloid PET scan , majority care partner would still agree amyloid PET scan perform requested specialist 6 . Care partner find amyloid PET cause increase adverse reaction ( scan visit ) standard routine clinic visit ( post-scan visit ) 7 . Care partner find diagnostic clinic visit ( post-scan visit ) cause increase adverse reaction first clinic visit ( pre-scan visit ) Aim 3 : 1 . Confidence radiologist / nuclear medicine physician interpretation scan increase add quantitative analysis compare qualitative analysis alone This study use [ 18F ] Flutemetamol-PET imaging ass quantify amyloid plaque burden patient mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) dementia unclear etiology , accord Diagnostic Statistical Manual-IV ( DSM-IV ) and/or National Institutes Aging-Alzheimer 's Association criterion , verify dementia specialist within 24 month . The [ 18F ] Flutemetamol-PET scan study participant assess use General Electric ( GE ) software database ( NeuroMarQ ) contain scan data healthy control individual evaluate abnormality amyloid plaque burden differ value expect individual age range .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must 45 90 year age inclusion research study . Confirmed diagnosis MCI dementia unclear etiology , accord DSMIV and/or National Institutes AgingAlzheimer 's Association criterion , verify dementia specialist within 24 month . Meets Appropriate Use Criteria ( AUC ) Cognitive complaint verify objectively confirm cognitive impairment ; The etiologic cause cognitive impairment uncertain comprehensive evaluation dementia specialist , include general medical neurological examination , mental status test include standard measure cognitive impairment , laboratory testing , structural neuroimaging ; Alzheimer 's disease diagnostic consideration ; Knowledge amyloid PET status expect alter diagnosis management . MRI and/or CT brain within 12 month prior enrollment ; Clinical laboratory assessment within 12 month prior enrollment : complete blood count ( CBC ) , standard blood chemistry profile , thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) , vitamin B12 ; Patient must agree clinical radiographic endpoint result laboratory information enter research database , evidence signing informed consent form . Patient must postmenopausal minimum one year , surgically sterile , confirm pregnant serum pregnancy test perform within 24 hour prior research PET imaging . All patient , legal guardian , must sign write informed consent HIPAA authorization accordance institutional guideline . Patients know allergic hypersensitivity reaction previously administer radiopharmaceutical . Patients significant drug allergy autoimmune disease may enrol Investigator 's discretion . Adult patient require monitored anesthesia PET scanning . Patients claustrophobic undergo PET imaging . Prior participation amyloid vaccination clinical study time past completion passive amyloid vaccination study within 6 month screen . Patients Normal cognition subjective complaint verify cognitive testing . Subject 's scan order one follow reason : Scan order solely base family history dementia , presence apolipoprotein E , lieu genotyping suspect autosomal mutation carrier ; Scan order nonmedical purpose ( e.g. , legal , insurance coverage , employment screening ) Currently pregnant Patients unwilling know result PET image scan .</criteria>
