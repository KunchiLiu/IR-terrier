	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Effect Vegetal Oil Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cognitive impairment syndrome define decrease intellectual performance respect previous step time . The Cognitive impairment consider functional alteration continuous physiological evolution happen set different circumstance : - A increase normal reduction , appear age sixty , also know Age-associated memory impairment ( AAMI ) - A mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , recent mild loss memory , high expect patient 's age educational level . - A severe pathological decrease mental ability , also know , depend characteristic : Severe cognitive impairment ( SCI ) , senile dementia Alzheimer 's disease ( 1 ) . In next year expect disease become one main health aged-related problem age people . ( 2 ) Nowadays , 35,6 million people kind dementia , estimate every year , 7,7 million new patient diagnose . ( 3 ) The amount people affect probably duplicate every 20 year , effective treatment stop evolution develop . The forecast estimate 81,1 million patient 2040 , make disease XXI century real epidemic . ( 4 ) Before reach level dementia , SCI Alzheimer 's disease , patient suffer progressive mild cognitive impairment . In level , disease early diagnose would worth act . Evidences Polyunsaturated oil use prevention and/or treatment cognitive impairment . Polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) help improve cognitive function . Neuronal tissue , brain , retina neurone-covering membrane ( myelin ) include high level PUFA . ( 5 ) PUFA 's act order transmission Nervous System . Population study report beneficial effect fish oil , high PUFA concentration , memory patient suffer mild cognitive impairment . ( 6 ) It also beneficial Alzheimer 's patient , deficient PUFA 's . A diet rich PUFA 'S improve cognitive function patient con cognitive impairment Alzheimer 's disease . ( 6-8 ) Epidemiological study suggest oil rich short chain PUFA , play beneficial role stop initial progression Alzheimer 's disease . The previous data confirm possibility beneficial effect product study ( mixture vegetable oil , rich triglyceride lecithin ) due common characteristic product PUFA 's already market .</detailed_description>
