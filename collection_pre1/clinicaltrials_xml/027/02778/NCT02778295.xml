	<detailed_description>Fabry disease progressive , inherit , multisystemic lysosomal storage disease character-ized specific neurological , cutaneous , renal , cardiovascular , cochleo-vestibular cere-brovascular manifestation . Annual incidence report 1 80,000 live birth figure may underestimate disease prevalence . When late-onset variant disease consider , prevalence approximately 1 3,000 suggest . Fabry disease pan-ethnic . The clinical picture cover wide spectrum range mild case heterozygous female , severe case classically affect hemizygous male residual alpha-galactosidase A activity . These patient may characteristic neurological ( pain ) , cutaneous ( angiokeratoma ) , renal ( proteinuria , kidney failure ) , cardiovascular ( cardiomyopa-thy , arrhythmia ) , cochleo-vestibular cerebrovascular ( transient ischemic attack , stroke ) sign disease . Female patient may mild severe symptom . Pain common early symptom Fabry disease ( chronic pain characterize burn tingle paresthesia occasional episodic crisis characterize agonize burn pain ) . Pain may resolve adulthood . Anhidrosis hypohidrosis may occur cause heat exercise intolerance . Other sign include angiokeratoma , corneal change , tinnitus , chronic fatigue , cardiac cerebrovascular abnormality ( leave ventricular hypertrophy , arrhythmia , angina , dyspnea , nephropathy ) . Fabry disease disorder glycosphingolipid metabolism cause deficient absent lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A activity relate mutation GLA gene ( Xq21.3-q22 ) encode alpha-galactosidase A enzyme . Deficient activity result accumulation globotriaosylceramide ( Gb3 ) within lysosome , believe trigger cascade cellular event . Definitive laboratory diagnosis involve demonstration mark enzyme deficiency hemizygous male . Enzyme analysis may occasionally help detect heterozygote often inconclusive due random X-chromosomal inactivation , make molecular testing ( genotyping ) females mandatory . In childhood , possible cause pain rheumatoid arthritis `` grow pain '' must rule . In adulthood , multiple sclerosis sometimes consider . Fabry disease transmit X-linked trait . The existence atypical , late-onset , variant availability specific therapy complicate genetic counseling . A disease-specific therapeutic option ( enzyme replacement therapy use vitro engineer alpha-galactosidase A ) recently introduce longterm outcome investigation preparation available , promise . Enzyme enhancement pharmacological chaperone currently investigation clinical trial . Conventional management consist pain relief analgesic drug , nephroprotection ( angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker ) , antiarrhythmic agent , pacemaker implantable cardioverter defibrillator , dialysis kidney transplant . With age , progressive damage vital organ system develop , possibly lead organ failure . Endstage renal disease life threaten cardiovascular cerebrovascular complication limit life expectancy untreated male female reduction 20 10 year , respectively , versus general population . New method , like mass-spectrometry give good chance characterize specific metabolic alteration blood ( plasma ) affect patient allow diagnose future disease earlier , high sensitivity specificity . Therefore goal study identify validate new biochemical marker plasma affect patient help benefit patient early diagnose thereby earlier treatment .</detailed_description>
