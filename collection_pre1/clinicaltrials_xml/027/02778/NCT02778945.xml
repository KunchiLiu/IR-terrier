	<brief_summary>In present study , investigator compare intermediate deep NMB i.e . two extreme regime muscle paralysis ( neuromuscular block ; NMB ) , ( I ) patient receive intermediate muscle paralysis ( `` control , conventional NMB '' ) versus ( II ) patient deep neuromuscular blockade rocuronium ( `` Deep NMB '' ) , compare surgical procedure consider sensitive inadequate muscle relaxation , elective minimally invasive spinal surgery . The primary objective trial compare operation time reduction help decrease stiffness target back muscle surround surgical field . The change back muscle stiffness also measure secondary objective goal mechanical tension weigh scale also take ultrasonography use shear wave elastography ( SWE ) . Other observational objective divide follow category stakeholder : patient , surgeon anesthesiologist ' , do collect variety clinical parameter . The follow collected compare . 1 . For patient Intraoperative radiation amount , post-anesthetic care unit ( PACU ) stay , transfer rate SICU post-op . care , post-operative respiratory complication rate , total hospital cost . 2 . For surgeon Post-operative complication regard operation field , evaluate surgical condition use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS score ) surgeon 's side . 3 . For anesthesiologist Intraoperative ventilation parameter patient , evaluate surgical condition use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS score ) anesthesiologist 's side .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient randomly assign two group IRB ( institutional review board ) approval , receive either deep neuromuscular blockade ( `` Deep NMB '' ) intermediate neuromuscular block ( `` Control NMB '' ) . Enrolled patient give number sequence enrollment receive treatment code use randomization schedule . The team take care patient perioperatively blind regard study ; include surgeon ( This study use two different responsible surgeon attending ) team , anesthesia care team operating room , PACU pain physician responsible postoperative pain management ( protocols departmental hospital clinical process ) . An additional unblinded anesthesiologist involve study management present patient ' arrival operation room patient ' discharge PACU . The unblinded study anesthesiologist take care patient ' anesthesia induction , calibration documentation neuromuscular monitoring management neuromuscular blockade . Primary endpoint : To compare measurement operation time reduction , operation time record institutional electronic medical chart incision final suture closure surgical wound . A difference 10 % change operation time two group consider clinically meaningful difference . Secondary endpoint : By use Mechanical Tension Weighing Scale ( MTWS ) mechanical dynamometer also Shear Wave Ultrasound Elastography ( SWE ) , value take following . 1 . Shear Wave Ultrasound Elastography ( SWE ) : SWE score value collect 3 time following . First , After enrol , obtain informed consent clinical study screening , SWE score measure take prior surgery basal value patient . Second , After Induction patient positioning , measure target back muscle stiffness use ultrasonography SWE . Third , SWE score measure finally stich discharge . 2 . Mechanical Tension Weighing Scale ( MTWS ) mechanical dynamometer : After surgical incision , measure target back muscle stiffness use MTWS . It compare study group . Other check point : To compare safety benefit deep neuromuscular block intermediate conventional NMB correspond sugammadex reversal . ( Other check point might change clinical trial initiation circumstantially ) The check point variable collect investigate compare safety benefit divide patient , surgeon anesthesiologist ' one collect variety clinical parameter . 1 . For patient intraoperative radiation amount , operation duration , anesthesia duration , post-anesthetic care unit ( PACU ) stay , transfer rate SICU post-op . care , post-operative respiratory complication rate , post-op pain score include patient control analgesia ( PCA ) , post-op nausea vomiting ( PONV ) , total hospital cost . 2 . For surgeon unintended movement surgery , compromise operating field tense surround muscle , post-operative complication regard operation field , evaluate surgical condition use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS score ) correlate muscle stiffness measure weigh scale SWE . 3 . For anesthesiologist Anesthetic time , intraoperative ventilation parameter patient , intraoperative vital sign monitor value , evaluate surgical condition use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS score ) correlate muscle stiffness measure weigh scale SWE . All clinical parameter collect within 48 hour surgery except total hospital cost patient .</detailed_description>
