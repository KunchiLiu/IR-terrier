	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Plasma Levels N-Methanocarbathymidine ( N-MCT ) Normal Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 trial evaluate safety pharmacokinetics N-MCT administer orally single ascend dose . Healthy male female ( non-pregnant , non-lactating ) subject age 18-45 , consent allow participate study upon screen meet inclusion / exclusion criterion . Subjects enrol one four cohort group sequentially . Each six subject group receive dos sequentially within 48 hour dose increase ( ie , second subject group receive dose 48 hour first subject receive dose ) . Cohort 1 ( 6 subject , male &amp; female ) receive 200 mg , Cohort 2 ( 6 subject , male &amp; female ) receive 400 mg , Cohort 3 ( 8 subject , male female , 2 placebo , 6 treat ) receive 800 mg Cohort 4 ( 8 subject , male female , 2 placebo , 6 treat ) receive 1200 mg N-MCT . Each cohort complete safety data evaluate prior initiate next cohort . All subject plasma urine sample evaluate N-MCT . The PI protocol IDMC review safety data ( AEs ) , safety lab , vital sign , finding Day 7 Cohort 1 enrol subject Cohort 2 . Cohort 2 data Day 7 review accordingly PI IDMC enrol subject Cohort 3 . Cohort 3 data Day 7 review PI IDMC enrol subject Cohort 4 . However , prior dose escalation new cohort describe , GHUCCTS IRB review approve , expedite review , IDMC report upon decision escalate dose new cohort base .</detailed_description>
