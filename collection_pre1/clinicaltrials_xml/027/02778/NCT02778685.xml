	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab , Letrozole , Palbociclib Treating Patients With Stage IV Estrogen Receptor Positive Breast Cancer With Stable Disease That Has Not Responded Letrozole Palbociclib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response rate ( ORR ) , base Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] , version 1.1 ) , pembrolizumab combination letrozole palbociclib patient metastatic estrogen receptor ( ER ) +human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) 2- breast cancer , determine addition pembrolizumab patient stable disease ( SD ) letrozole palbociclib achieve response ( complete response [ CR ] , partial response [ PR ] , ORR ) measure study baseline , base RECIST version 1.1 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability add pembrolizumab ( 200 mg every 3 week ) ongoing treatment letrozole ( 2.5 mg ) palbociclib ( 3 week , one week : dose palbociclib vary secondary individual patient tolerance , range 75-125 mg ) patient metastatic ER+HER2- breast cancer . II . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) . III . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) . IV . To evaluate duration response ( DOR ) use RECIST version 1.1 . V. To evaluate clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) use RECIST version 1.1 . VI . To evaluate toxicity ( use National Cancer Institute [ NCI ] Common Terminology Criteria adverse Events [ CTCAE ] , version 4.0 ) associate triple drug combination ( pembrolizumab , letrozole , palbociclib ) patient metastatic ER+HER2- breast cancer . VII . To evaluate CR , PR , ORR , PFS , DOR , CBR use immune-related Response Criteria In Solid Tumors ( irRECIST ) ; time treatment failure also assess . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study cellular/humoral immune response analyze immune stromal cell characteristic treatment correlate clinical response ; include program cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) expression level . II . To study peripheral serum thymidine kinase ( TK ) level association treatment response . III . To study circulate tumor deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ( ctDNA ) effect combine pembrolizumab , letrozole , palbociclib ctDNA profile . OUTLINE : Patients receive letrozole orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 palbociclib PO QD 3 week . Courses letrozole palbociclib repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Courses pembrolizumab repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 6 month 3 year , every 12 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
