	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Pharmacokinetics Maraviroc HIV-1-Exposed Infants Risk Acquiring HIV-1 Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Maraviroc CCR5 receptor antagonist use treat HIV infection adult . Adding maraviroc standard care prophylaxis regimen may also reduce risk perinatal transmission HIV . The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics maraviroc HIV-1-exposed infant risk mother-to-child HIV transmission . This study also determine appropriate dose maraviroc first 6 week life . The study enroll 72 mother-infant pair two cohort . Because maraviroc interacts antiretroviral drug efavirenz ( EFV ) adult , infant study stratify within cohort base exposure maternal EFV . Cohort 1 stratify utero exposure maternal EFV , infant strata receive single dose maraviroc solution within 3 day birth another single dose Week 1 life . Stratum 1A include infant without utero exposure maternal EFV 8 week immediately delivery . Stratum 1B include infant utero exposure maternal EFV minimum 2 week immediately delivery . Cohort 2 stratify exposure maternal EFV birth , infant strata receive maraviroc oral solution twice daily start within 3 day birth continue 42 day . The initial start dose Cohort 2 determine base finding Cohort 1 . Stratum 2A include infant without exposure maternal EFV either utero 8 week immediately delivery breastfeeding . Stratum 2B include breastfeed infant exposure maternal EFV utero birth breastfeeding , minimum 2 week immediately delivery breastfeeding . Participants attend entry visit within 3 day infant 's birth . Participants attend 5 6 study visit Month 4 . Visits may include medical history review , physical examination , blood collection mother and/or infant , HIV testing , adherence counseling .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Mother legal age provide independent informed consent research participation willing able provide write informed consent infant 's participation study . Mother confirm HIV1 infection base test two sample collect different time point . More information criterion find protocol . At entry , infant meet EFV exposure requirement , base mother 's report confirm medical record available , follow : For Cohort 1 , Stratum 1A : Infant born mother receive EFV eight week immediately prior delivery . Note : Breastfeeding formula feed infant eligible stratum . For Cohort 1 , Stratum 1B : Infant born mother receive EFV minimum two week immediately prior delivery . Note : Breastfeeding formula feed infant eligible stratum . For Cohort 2 , Stratum 2A : Infants born mother receive EFV eight week immediately prior delivery breastfeeding , mother receive maternal EFV . Note : Breastfeeding formula feed infant eligible stratum . For Cohort 2 , Stratum 2B : Breastfeeding infant bear mother receive EFV minimum two week immediately prior delivery , intend breastfeed minimum six week continue receive maternal EFV breastfeeding . Note : Only breastfeed infant eligible stratum . At birth , infant 's estimate gestational age least 37 week . Note : If gestational age birth document infant 's available birth record , study staff may assess gestational age early possible opportunity screen period use assessment purpose eligibility determination . At birth , infant 's weight least 2 kg . Note : If weight birth document infant 's available birth record , study staff may assess infant weight early possible opportunity screen period use assessment purpose eligibility determination . At entry , infant le equal 3 day old . At entry , infant follow lab value : Grade 0 alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ( normal ) Less equal Grade 1 aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) total bilirubin Less equal Grade 2 hemoglobin , white blood cell count , platelet count At entry , infant initiate antiretroviral prophylaxis include potent CYP3A4 inhibitor inducer . See protocol information . At entry , infant assess site investigator designee generally healthy base review available medical record , available medical history information , physical examination finding . Born singleton delivery ( multiple birth ) . Infant condition , opinion site investigator designee , would make participation study unsafe , complicate interpretation study outcome data , otherwise interfere achieve study objective ; example , severe congenital malformation , medical condition , clinically significant find physical examination . At entry , positive infant HIV nucleic acid test result ( result require available prior entry positive result obtain prior entry exclusionary ) . At entry , infant breastfeed mother receive disallow medication list protocol . Mother receive maraviroc pregnancy .</criteria>
