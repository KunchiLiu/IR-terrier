	<brief_title>Predicting Hypoglycaemia Arrhythmias Patient With Diabetes CKD - Validation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , especially long duration diabetes , insulin treatment chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) vulnerable patient exhibit high risk cardiac arrhythmia sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) . Various factor presence coronary heart disease , diabetic cardiomyopathy well autonomic neuropathy underlie pathology associate development potentially fatal arrhythmias patient hypoglycemic event consider directly trigger arrhythmia . It postulate severe hypoglycemia may lead cardiac arrhythmia , later summarize `` dead bed '' syndrome . In addition , recent data large cardiovascular outcome trial patient type 2 diabetes suggest severe hypoglycemia associate increase risk cardiovascular event cardiovascular relate death . Moreover , CKD markedly increase risk hypoglycemia even moderate impairment kidney function ( eGFR &lt; 45 ml/min ) associate significant increase SCD . Various pathophysiological mechanism may contribute increase cardiovascular mortality hypoglycemia include hypoglycemia-induced release catecholamine , pro-arrhythmogenic ECG alteration well inflammatory change . Morphological functional alteration heart occur CKD contribute mechanism . So far performed study limit short duration glucose ECG monitoring fact 3 lead Holter-ECGs use , thus allow assessment sophisticated ECG abnormality QT dispersion , T-wave alternans , late potential . Therefore clear data exist predict arrhythmia SCD relation hypoglycemia patient diabetes . Ideally , SCD risk score could identify characterize high-risk patient date little known hypoglycemia-associated ECG marker identification patient risk arrhythmias SCD . In general population , various ECG risk marker SCD identify heart rate , cardiac rhythm abnormality , atrioventriculare ( AV ) block , QT length , QT dispersion , heart-rate variability ( HRV ) , T-wave alternans , late potential , well left- ( LBBB ) right-bundle branch block ( RBBB ) ( review ) . In patient diabetes hypoglycemia , diabetic cardiomyopathy , well presence autonomic neuropathy may lead ECG abnormality . Merely sparse data exist effect spontaneous hypoglycemic episode change ECG parameter small study patient type 1 diabetes demonstrate nocturnal hypoglycemia associate decrease low-frequency component heart rate variability . To date , sophisticated marker QT dispersion , late potential , T-wave alternans examine `` real-life setting '' , likely marker require 12 lead ECG registration long duration . However , establishment risk algorithm prediction hypoglycemia-associated arrhythmias mandatory perform long duration simultaneous glucose monitor 12 lead ECG registration capture ECG risk marker SCD . In actually run project investigator evaluate association hypoglycemic events/glucose swing arrhythmias/ECG predictor SCD clinical study perform 50 patient insulin-treated diabetes moderate severe CKD . These patient receive 7 day continuous glucose ECG registration data use development risk assessment model . The current validation study seek confirm risk assessment model develop collaboration AICES - Aachen Institute Advanced Study Computational Engineering Science approve capacitive ECG registration device obtain collaboration Philips Chair Medical Information Technology University Clinical Center Aachen ( UKA ) . To end , 10 patient insulin-treated diabetes moderate severe CKD include . Seven day glucose monitor well data capacitive ECG recording generate study , thus allow validation adjustment develop medical hardware mathematic model . The study item 12-lead ECG T-shirt consist textile electrode data log device . The device record long-term 12-lead ECG data . The purpose T-shirt improve patient 's comfort long-term recording prevent adverse effect regular ECG electrode . Current system limit use ECG electrode , hardly tolerate patient severe direct side effect skin rash bullous lesion . These side effect result skin preparation electrode gel . The propose ECG T-shirt need problematic preparation . Another benefit fix placement electrode T-shirt . In regular 12-lead ECG long-term recording , electrode may fall patient need reattach . Therefore , faulty position electrode may occur .</detailed_description>
