	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY : Single centre , double-blind , randomise , placebo-controlled , 4-way crossover study 4 single-dose treatment period . The washout period dose 5 day . Screening : Subjects screen eligibility within 28 7 day first admission . The screening consist : medical history ; physical examination , vital sign ; complete neurological examination ; 12-lead ECG ; haematology , coagulation , plasma biochemistry urinalysis test ; HIV , hepatitis B hepatitis C serology ; drug abuse alcohol screen ; urine pregnancy test woman childbearing potential ; review selection criterion . Treatment period : In treatment period , eligible subject admit UFH day prior receive study medication : vital sign ; medical history physical examination update ; 12-lead ECG ; haematology plasma biochemistry ; drug abuse alcohol screen ; urine pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . On first admission , subject review selection criterion randomly assign one treatment sequence . On morning dosing day , subject receive dose nebicapone/placebo concomitantly dose Madopar® HBS 125 fasting condition ( least 8 hour ) remain UFH least 24 h post-dose ; , leave return next period follow-up visit . At give time-points pre-dose discharge , subject submit vital sign record , brief neurological examination , 12-lead ECG , blood sample plasma drug determination erythrocyte S-COMT activity assay . At discharge , vital sign ECG record , haematology plasma biochemistry test perform . Blood sample ( 7 mL ) determination plasma concentration levodopa , 3-O-methyldopa ( 3-OMD ) nebicapone , assay erythrocyte S-COMT activity take follow time : pre-dose , ½ , 1 , 1½ , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 24 h post-dose . Follow-up : A follow-up visit occur approximately 7-10 day discharge last treatment period early discontinuation : medical history physical examination update ; vital sign ; 12-lead ECG ; haematology , plasma biochemistry urinalysis test ; pregnancy test woman childbearing potential .</detailed_description>
