	<brief_summary>It suggest augment repetitive task practice use box ( mirror ) therapy ( BT ) enhance benefit task practice may provide stroke survivor opportunity engage self-directed practice outside normally schedule therapy session . However , dosage BT use clinical practice unclear . In order practitioner begin integrate BT clinical practice situation information need determine defines therapeutic dose . The aim study differentiate two dosage self-directed BT add treatment usual decreasing arm hand motor impairment , improve activity level , increase self-directed participation stroke . Forty-five subject Stroke Rehabilitation Unit Helen Hayes Hospital ( HHH ) randomly assign three group : treatment usual plus 30 minute dosage self-directed BT 5x/week ; treatment usual plus 60 minute dosage self-directed BT 5x/week ; treatment usual plus 30 minute self-directed sham BT 5x/week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mirror Therapy After Stroke : A Dosing Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 795,000 people United States stroke year , stroke consider leading cause long-term disability . Impairments arm hand function common stroke limit engagement daily life activity , impact overall quality life stroke survivor . It find incomplete upper limb recovery predict health relate quality life stroke survivor one year post-stroke four ( self-care , usual activity , pain/discomfort , &amp; anxiety/depression ) five domain measure EuroQol-5D questionnaire . Thus , evidence-based intervention improve arm hand function stroke need . In fact , recent study identify `` treatment upper extremity recovery '' one top ten research priority relate life stroke accord stroke survivor , caregiver , health professional . Evidence suggest task-oriented training intervention Repetitive Task Practice ( RTP ) effective improve upper extremity ( UE ) function activity , therapy participation stroke survivor . Recently , suggest augment RTP use cognitive strategy , Mirror Box Therapy ( BT ) , enhance benefit task practice may provide stroke survivor opportunity engage self-directed practice outside normally schedule therapy session . During BT , person engages motor activity unimpaired limb watch mirror reflection superimpose ( unseen ) impair limb ; process create visual illusion whereby activity perform unimpaired limb attribute impaired limb . While generate visual illusion common ingredient publish BT effectiveness trial , actual treatment protocol differ considerably . One important protocol difference see across publish trial relate dosage BT . For instance , minute BT provide range 10 minute 60 minute per session ; session frequency range 1 7 session per week , length intervention range 3 6 week . Thus , dosage BT use clinical practice unclear . In order practitioner begin integrate BT clinical practice information need effective dosage , may vary accord multiple factor ( e.g. , stage recovery , survivor 's current functional limitation , environment service render ) .</detailed_description>
