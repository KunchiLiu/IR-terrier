	<brief_summary>Pars plana vitrectomy usually perform general anesthesia include endotracheal intubation muscle relaxation . However , short procedure anesthesia use laryngeal mask without muscle relaxation also common practice . In observational study incidence patient movement examine anesthesia technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Usually eye surgery safely perform local anesthesia . However , eye open procedure , general anesthesia may safer alternative . The intraocular pressure less stable wake patient anesthetized patient increase intraocular pressure lead prolapse vitreous . Moreover , wake patient may move procedure movement surgery cause serious lesion retina consecutive loss vision due intraocular instrument . A typical intraocular procedure vitrectomy . During vitrectomy vitreous body remove substituted silicon oil gas . Vitrectomy usually perform inserting instrument par plana eye . The par plana , area iris retina , contain structure essential vision . On one side eye light source access intraocular infusion introduce eye par plana . An infusion connect fixed 60 cm eye level thus maintain intraocular pressure gravity . On opposite side eye instrument like scalpel , scissors instrument combine cut suction vitreous insert tube . Common indication vitrectomy vitreous body bleeding retinal detachment . Reliable immobilization anesthesia mandatory vitrectomy . However , anesthesia vitrectomy complicate fact anatomical structure risk reach early operation consequently much time adopt anesthesia dosage individual patient ` need . At end procedure critical area leave minute conjunctival suture leave relatively short period time recovery anesthesia extubation . Possibly due difficulty deviation vision axis patient movement uncommon general anesthesia eye operation . Usually event dealt supplementation anesthesia muscle relaxation , lead impairment operation condition put patient risk eye damage loss vision . Rossiter co-worker investigated quality immobilisation 52 patient eye surgery . Even small eye movement like upward deviation vision axis regard incomplete immobilisation study interfere surgery thereby increase risk complication . In four 52 patient ( 7.6 % ) eye movement observe surgery ( Rossiter 2006 ) . It show study deviation quantify depend patient ` preoperative finding ( Daien 2013 ) . Vitrectomy perform 20-gauge- 23-gauge sutureless transconjunctival vitrectomy , depend diameter intraocular access channel ( Aylward 2011 ) 3 . Generally , operation time considerably shorter 23-Gauge-vitrectomie , conjunctival suture need . Hence , 23 Gauge-vitrectomies perform general anesthesia use laryngeal mask without muscle relaxation institution . 20-Gauge-vitrectomies perform general anesthesia endotracheal intubation due long operation time . However , total muscle relaxation maintain first 30 - 45 min surgery reliable immobilization reach volatile anesthetic . The result Rossiter co-worker show eye movement occur surgery without muscle relaxation study . Hence , may argue immobilization balance anesthesia 23 Gauge-vitrectomy second half 20 Gauge-vitrectomy may inferior immobilization addition muscle relaxant . Objective prospective observational study comparison immobilization quality general anesthesia par plana-vitrectomy without neuromuscular blockade endotracheal intubation .</detailed_description>
