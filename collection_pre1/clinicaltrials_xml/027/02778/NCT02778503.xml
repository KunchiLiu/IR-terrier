	<brief_summary>Atraumatic Restorative Treatment ( ART ) alternative restorative technique dental caries , apply partial caries tissue removal philosophy use hand instrument , relative cotton roll isolation , immediate restoration Glass Ionomer Cements ( GIC ) avoid local anesthesia . The choose material study High Viscosity Glass Ionomer Cement ( HVGIC ) due unique physical-chemical property well applicability challenge clinical situation material would adequate . Although substantial evidence regard GIC property , information GIC ( different cost ) longevity still weak . Therefore , objective study ass effectiveness ART restoration perform low-cost HVGIC cavitated dentine carious lesion primary permanent molar . This multicenter randomize control double-blind ( patient operator ) clinical trial perform 680 primary and/or permanent molar child 4 9 year old presenting cavitated dentine carious lesion occlusal occlusal-proximal surface . The tooth consider unit sample , randomly allocate group generate random list number distribute dark seal envelope open dental assistant . Teeth test group submit restorative treatment HVGIC Vitro Molar control group HVGIC Fuji IX . The restoration effectiveness assess mean clinical bitewing x-rays control 6 12 month .</brief_summary>
