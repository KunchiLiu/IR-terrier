	<brief_summary>Progressive Supranuclear Palsy ( PSP ) , Cortico-Basal Degeneration ( CBD ) Multiple System Atrophy ( MSA ) degenerative brain condition currently curative treatment . To aid development new treatment trial , press need develop good method diagnose condition early , track disease progression . The PROSPECT-M-UK study collect standardise clinical data time . Patients also option brain MRI scan , eye movement exam donate blood , skin spinal fluid sample , aim identify `` biomarkers '' improve accuracy early diagnosis track natural time course disease . Control participants meet criterion Parkinson 's disease define condition consider investigator group ally syndrome risk state ( atypical parkinsonian syndrome ) , also examine . Patients also participate via CBD European registry one-off study assessment cross-sectional study , involve complete questionnaire blood sample donation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There group neurodegenerative disorder often initially diagnose Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , biologically clinically distinct , follow malignant disease course . The three common condition PSP , CBD MSA . These condition median survival approximately 6-7 year unlike PD , respond well dopamine replacement therapy . PSP CBD characterize tau-pathology MSA alpha-synuclein pathology . A great deal pre-clinical work carry tau alpha-synuclein disease model , yet disease modify agent condition . There number potential therapeutic compound development order improve likelihood success , press need increase number early case patient recruit new treatment trail . Thus , good method improve accuracy early diagnosis track progression need develop . This achieve : 1. detailed study change patient ' clinical state time ; 2. study `` biomarkers '' blood , skin , spinal fluid brain MRI . The investigator recruit patient PSP , CBD MSA refer specialist clinic assessment treatment . An additional group Atypical parkinsonian syndrome ( APS ) case meet criterion Parkinson 's disease define condition , consider investigator group ally syndrome risk state also invite participate study . People unaffected neurological disease invite participate one-off occasion . Being involve PROSPECT-M-UK longitudinal study involve attend research assessment 5 occasion 3 year ; neurological examination ; complete questionnaire provide detail clinical history , self/carer report functional scale quality life ; neuropsychology assessment ; eye movement exam ; donate blood skin sample ; patient invite lumbar puncture spinal fluid collection brain MRI scan two occasion ( baseline 1 year follow-up ) . Patients also agree contact phone clinic appointment two occasion 4 5 year . In addition , cross-sectional cohort establish , enable participation patient travel study centre . This involve donate blood sample return study questionnaire . A CBD European registry also create involve structure neurological assessment , medical note review blood sample donation . The primary outcome study duration disease , aim improve method early diagnosis track disease progression . Importantly , study link together centre researcher across Europe establish infrastructure create trial ready cohort future therapeutic study PSP/CBD/MSA .</detailed_description>
