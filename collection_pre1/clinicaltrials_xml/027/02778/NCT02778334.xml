	<detailed_description>Introduction literature review With 130 000 case per year France 2010 , stroke one common neurological disease , often leave many disable sequelae physical cognitive level ( currently live 500 000 disable follow stroke ) lead loss significant autonomy patient . However , many stroke survivor soon find range comparable previous state . Investigators ask impact life event people apparently show visible effect : psychological repercussion stroke patient healthy ; change daily life , particularly mental function brutal confrontation mortality ? Research psychology psychiatric disorder post-stroke indicate frequency occurrence depression 30-40 % patient , occurrence anxiety disorder 20 % 30 % patient . Depression anxiety stroke influence presence sequel , preliminary study ( see Psycho-stroke current study ) patient impairment independence three month stroke Investigators observe presence depressive anxious symptom . The psychological health influence patient 's quality life overall . Recent result thus demonstrate post-stroke depression increase risk short- long-term mortality . It therefore seem essential identify risk factor influence depression anxiety stroke , particularly patient rapidly almost completely recover aftermath accident , prevent emergence support . In scientific literature , individual coping strategy cop strategy , development identify factor influence post-stroke psychological health . Thus , active coping center problem would associate good mental health status , passive coping center managing emotion would instead poor prognostic factor . However , clinical understanding everyday process adaptation among survivor stroke limited assessment method conventionally use research , question memory `` general '' subject . Modern techniques increasingly use , Experiences Sampling Method ( ESM ) Ecological Momentary Assessment ( EMA ) allow assessment individual functioning ecologically carry natural environment subject greatly limit retrospective recall . The application method population stroke survivor already validate one study also show active behavior ( work , sport ) would post-stroke depression risk factor , whereas presence social environment ( among friend , relative ) would protective factor . However , study interested certain type behavior , comparable cop strategy ( active coping , social support research ) representative whole , study specifically interested evaluation cop method stroke patient . It seem interesting use similar methodology observe vivo finer accurate adaptation strategy stroke survivor , thus ecological representation cop . The factor influence Investigators choose investigate study relate symptomatic form depression anxiety . It important first note somatic cognitive consequence stroke close depression anxiety manifestation . This symptomatic overlap make difficult locate diagnose disorder . Determine specific seem necessary , would involve identification symptom psychopathological would significantly associate depression anxiety last intense . Studies post-stroke depression reveal symptom relate mood , thought depressive emotion durable predict diagnosis depression intensity long term , somatic symptom ( fatigue ) acute phase stroke show significant association long-term mental health . Investigators find publish study indicate result subject regard post-stroke anxiety . However , Psycho-stroke current study , initial result show psychic symptom anxiety three month stroke predict anxiety six month . Investigators would like deepen result focus shorter-term variable , say first day occurrence accident , study link mental health status quality life first month follow stroke . Again , use modern evaluation method ( ESM / EMA ) capture emotional psychological phenomenon almost instantaneously , thus promote clinical understanding mental disorder stroke . This approach , already apply context post-stroke depression , however , use study anxiety population , although research population interested anxiety assess . Objectives : Our project aim well understand psychological repercussion stroke patient quickly find health autonomy comparable previous state . The objective investigate relationship depressive symptom anxiety , cop strategy quality life acute phase first month onset stroke . This period particularly demand patient must therefore adapt readjust continuously : shock stroke , hospitalization several service ( intensive care , neurology , rehabilitation ) , back home , `` new '' life change relate stroke , resumption professional activity , etc ... Our methodology combine tool conventionally use ( standardized interview , validate questionnaire ) new , ecological true method ( Experience Sampling Method apply use smarphone application ) ass different variable study . This initially determine whether various symptom depression one hand anxiety hand , depend mode expression ( vs. outsource internalize ; ie emotional , cognitive , somatic ) , observe acute phase stroke , relate predict quality life , depression anxiety long term ( four month stroke ) . Furthermore , study observe individual coping strategy ( cop ) daily evolution influence psychological status quality life month follow stroke . Methodology Population N wait 75 patient . Recruitment Location : Neuro-Vascular Unit St. Joseph Hospital . Study duration : 18 24 month depend pace inclusion . Procedure After submission approval project Patient Protection Committee propose patient fulfil inclusion criterion participate study informed progress objective ( note ( cf . . Annexes ) meeting psychologist ) . Camille Vansimaeys , psychologist principal investigator study also one see patient conduct interview part research . Patients accept see maintenance hospitalization Neuro-Vascular Unit ( T0 = 4 7 day post-stroke ) ass depression anxiety ( hetero-evaluation ) . Socio-demographic medical data collect file anonymous . At time release UNV ( T1 = 12 day average hospitalization ) , patient divide two group : 1 ) patient return home 2 ) patient continue hospitalization rehabilitation . Depression , anxiety , quality life cop strategy assess self-administered questionnaire . A first phase ambulatory ( ESM / EMA ) also take place follow UNV output : 5 time day 7 day patient respond question evaluate depression , anxiety cop strategy . Patients answer question via smartphone app ( issue ESM ) . The application directly instal personal smartphones patient . For patient smartphone configure used application lent time study University Paris Descartes . Patients entrust smartphones sign additional form framing term loan . An explanation operation application smartphones make time first interview hospital , train phase perform hospitalization . During phase measurement smartphones , patient contact three day first evaluation , address resolve difficulty use , remind people smartphone lent loading . Another ambulatory phase model perform T1 ( 5 time daily 7 day ) accompany self-assessment depression , anxiety , cop strategy quality life make 2 month post-stroke ( T2 ) . The last time study take place 4 month stroke onset ( T3 ) . Patients review interview ass depression anxiety ( hetero self assessment ) well cop strategy quality life ( self-questionnaires ) . Ambulatory measurement phase ( 1 week , 5 time day ) also accompany evaluation . It make interview half population , half control possible parasitic effect . ethical implication The intervention research vulnerable patient occurrence stroke , therefore may certain psychic emotional vulnerability particularly challenging time , implies Investigators attentive many ethical consideration . First , important emphasize proper monitoring offer patient whose psychic suffer manifest different assessment . Investigators verify follow difficulty , Investigators redirect health professional support . Similarly , patient simply express follow-up request direct appropriate care . It also check patient willing participate research understood objective conduct . It also specify clearly participation , refusal participate withdrawal study case affect management relationship medical nursing team . Tools All tool use validated French version . • Straight-evaluation The hetero-evaluative tool involve identification semiotic element semi-structured clinical interview conduct experienced evaluator train award tool ( case clinical psychologist charge study ) . They fill patient , investigator ( psychologist ) ask question base questionnaire , formulate differently different patient . MINI ( Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inventory ) ( Sheehan et al. , 1998 ; Lecrubier et al. , 1998 ) . This must-semi-structured interview guide psychological research , use part professional practice psychologist . This inventory gather information semiotic element assist diagnosis certain psychiatric disorder accord DSM-IV . Modules A ( major depressive disorder ) , B ( dysthymia ) , I ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) , O ( GAD ) L ( psychotic disorder ) MINI use assess presence absence disorder mood ( major depression , dysthymia ) , anxiety disorder ( generalize anxiety post-traumatic stress , ass relevant study traumatogenic dimension Stroke ) identify subject present psychotic disorder include study , mainly alter perception reality . In addition , module psychotic disorder introduce patient tell invastigator ask question unusual bizarre experiment occur people . `` Thereby depersonalize maintenance reassurance fact issue part standard valuation method raise order argue diagnostic hypothesis concern . MADRS ( 10 item ) ( Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale ) ( Montgomery Asberg , 1979 ; Lempérière , 1984 ) use assess intensity depressive symptom . This scale reference scale area , include ten item assess different aspect depressive symptomatology . HAM-A ( 14 item ) ( Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ) ( Hamilton , 1959 Pichot , 1959 ) scale measure state anxiety . This scale intensity score general anxiety , consist two sub-scores somatic anxiety one hand , psychic anxiety . • Self evaluation These tool questionnaire complete person self-evaluated . BDI-II ( 21 item ) ( Beck Depression Inventory 2nd ed ) assess severity depressive symptom . Twenty-one group statement different symptom depression available , patient select one best match feel . The advantage choose tool ass different aspect depression term physical symptom cognitive emotional . HADS ( 14 item ) ( Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ) . This scale assess severity depressive anxious symptomatology . This used tool somatic disease neurological particular . This survey present advantage short , assess symptom somatic psychological symptomatology . Brief-COPE ( 28 item ) : This questionnaire assess 14 separate dimension cop ( two item per dimension ) : active coping , planning , instrumental support , emotional support , expression feeling , positive reinterpretation , acceptance , denial , blame , humor , religion , entertainment , substance use disengagement behavioral . WHOQOL BREF scale assess quality life use 26 item , include two related overall quality life . This questionnaire allow u understand dimensionally subjective perception person 's life , different field compose . Physical health : include aspect pain , fatigue work ability ; mental health : compose among others positive negative emotion self-esteem ; social relation : include personal , private life available social support ; finally live environment element financial resource , access information resource , recreation , etc ... • Ambulatory Measures : ESM / EMA These measure carry via smartphone app . The select item previous study measure variable , build specifically study basis validate tool . Symptoms depression anxiety : symptom depression anxiety present DSM-IV-TR show variability day assess dimensionally Likert scale 7 point . Eg depression : sad mood , anhedonia , fatigue , difficulty concentrating , negative / pessimistic thought . Life event : question focus occurrence last three hour event positive impact one hand , negative . Participants indicate specific area life event . strategy adapt stressful event : cop strategy evaluate adapt question brief-COPE . Participants indicate react negative event previously identify select list statement match response , example : `` I turn ( e ) work activity take mind. `` Evaluation method use different time study : Preservation analysis data : A basic anonymous data create . Only investigator access concordance table link questionnaire complete patient data database create . The statistical study conduct investigator locally hospital Saint Joseph group . There exchange data . Different statistical test use analyze data : analyzes variance , correlation , regression . Investigators try update significant association depressive anxious symptom , cop quality life first month stroke , control influence variable effect ( neurological status , level autonomy , hospital stay time return home , etc ... ) . Investigators compare evolution different dimension two subgroup patient ( back home inpatient rehabilitation T1 service ) . Medical information stroke data effect ( cognitive motor function affect , severity sequela , area autonomy would eventually reduce , type location stroke , etc ... ) account analyze result investigate possible existence link anxiety depression level . The data store smartphones transfer directly smartphone computer store data ; host secure server certify . In case , server either already obtain necessary authorization CNIL ; application make . Expected result The general clinical significance project determine element identify , time initial hospitalization follow stroke , patient risk adversely psychological evolution physical medical condition allow quickly return home . The result interest assessment management post-stroke psychiatric disorder : distinguish characteristic depression anxiety consecutive event order facilitate diagnosis acute phase stroke direct support . The symptomatological risk profile thus detect specific therapy prominent symptom disorder field stroke may propose / develop . Moreover , result enable greener detail understanding process connect individual coping strategy , post-stroke psychological problem quality life various important time disease . project interest Our project several interest . First , provide longitudinal study track first month post-stroke , combine several complementary assessment method enable comprehensive representation psychological manifestation : standardized tool traditionally use environmentally friendly method . This design study provide good understand psychic development key stage life process patient stroke ( hospitalization another service , return home ) . Several clinical implication expect : develop prevention post-stroke psychological problem allow specific identification depression anxiety acute phase ; identify target supported specific disorder field stroke ; improve Supported favor development cop strategy associate long-term mental health reduce associate negative development ; understand healthy patient stroke quickly return home , live important step provide support tailor suit specific need .</detailed_description>
