	<brief_summary>Linezolid , primary treatment MDR-TB combination therapy anti . Until dose 600 mg x1 / day , rather sensible patient , unanimous . It true dosage consensus , go without say , interindividual variability , mark moreover linezolid , therapeutic monitoring assay plasma level indispensable pharmacological treatment . This therapeutic drug monitoring ( TDM ) often give rise , know , dosage change . It turn present real STP basic objective PK / PD really make France treatment tuberculosis ( TB ) bibliography remain rather poor recommendation , yet element : indeed linezolid antibiotic whose activity purely `` time-dependent '' . So one fulfill 2 PK / PD objective whose precise boundary sometimes still determine : - % T &gt; MIC , percentage time spend plasma concentration minimum inhibitory concentration linezolid ( LNZ ) Mycobacterium tuberculosis . In practice , residual concentration next shot must &gt; MIC ( 0.125 1 mg / l ) - A fortiori must also take account concentration prevent appearance resistant mutant , amount 1.2 mg / l - AUC / MIC &gt; 80 , ratio area curve ( AUC , Area curve ) plasma concentration versus time CMI LNZ Until , without real bibliographic support , sake kindness patient coupled economic advantage , STP consist 2 sample , peak 1:30 taking ( Cmax ) residual take ( C min ) , , 600mg x1 / 24 correlate well AUC ( 55 % peak 75 % residual ) . Following observation 25 30 % patient C min &lt; 1.2 mg / L , even frequently &lt; 0.2 mg / L 600 mg x 1 , low peak leave presage AUC may insufficient well . This study therefore imperative pharmacological streamline ensure adequate therapeutic monitoring involve maximum minimum toxicity efficiency . And light already practiced molecule mycophenolate example carry AUC miniAUC example . It would therefore achievement AUC patient treat LNZ TB MDR / XDR week . Achieving require AUC obtain 7 blood sample give day instead two sample take present . Indeed one must mind peak rational / residual become blur context , one two goal PK / PD fill ( Cmin &gt; MIC / CMP ) expense second ( AUC ) . The benefit , direct indirect multiple obtain ensure protocol . The study analyze individual data confirm accuracy dose fractionation 300mgx2 / day time highlight potential new dosage adjustment would need achieve study , substantial gain term efficacy toxicity via suitable therapeutic monitoring . Secondly , determine collection point , patient , dose interest take late routine STP order collect less point ( eg miniAUC MPA ) retain statistical power estimate kinetic parameter , mainly AUC ( eg aminoglycoside also ) . Finally third phase construction basis individual kinetics population pharmacokinetic model highlight population parameter especially co-related variable explain high pharmacokinetic variability allow follow patient determine individually tailor dose immediately first shot first assay .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective : Determination AUC / MIC % T &gt; MIC patient confirm appropriateness , light peak residual , interest split dose frequently perform case low residual toxicity secondary objective : Determination point privilege sample context maximum statistical power minimal stress patient . - Outlook : Development population PK model determination co-variables interest individualize dosage immediately next patient Methodology : Prospective , multi-center , non-interventional type routine care Study duration : 1 day / patient , maximum total duration recruitment : 6 month , aim 30-40patients included Acquisition data : Additional medium ( Informed consent , sample protocol , collection form biological , clinical pharmacological patient treatment ) - Statistical analysis software suitable pharmacokinetic - Anonymity data : identifier subject award ( first name surname / number ) data enter computer file retain sponsor GHPSJ site realization determination AUC optimal dosage . Development study : - Performance study - Expected duration patient recruitment : 6 month - Number patient recruit 30 40 patient , limited number hospitalize patient recruit center ( sanatorium Bligny ) , combine MDR-TB treatment linezolid - Duration study patient : 12 24 hour time 7 sample . - Regarding iterative sampling prevention potentially associate pain , patient already KT PAC place administer IV drug ( amiklin , augmentin vitamin particular ) , therefore plan take sample . For patient system place use , explain propose establishment device Catelon patch Emla , decision matter patient . Destruction sample : sample retain use study . They destroy accordance rule good practice research laboratory . Data : Data include clinical biological , bacteriological patient . The GHPSJ guarantee biological material digitally encode involve direct identify information subject participate research . The shipment make sanatorium Bligny staff supervision investigator within department ( Dr Mathilde Jachym Damien Le Du ) . Ethical aspect : After notification CPP Ile de France II , project classify `` research routine care . '' The opinion CPP Ile de France II request meeting June 2015 . The manager research center hospital group Paris Saint-Joseph ( GHPSJ ) . The latter contract SHAM ( usual insurer GHPSJ care clinical research ) ensure risk blood sample . The research information issue signature Circular collect patient . An agreement make institution , GHPSJ Bligny Medical Center , include logistics transport harvest management .</detailed_description>
