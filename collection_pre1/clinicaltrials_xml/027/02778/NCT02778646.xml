	<brief_summary>Familial hypercholesterolaemia ( FH ) autosomal dominant somatic mutation commonly locate LDL-receptor , APOB , PCKS9 gene . The estimated prevalence homozygous FH estimate 1 million , whereas prevalence heterozygous FH range 1/500-1/200 ( 0.2-0.5 % ) general population . The majority individual suffer FH remain undiagnosed without treatment . Using preexist clinical guideline , study score patient within national cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) registries FH aim evaluate prevalence FH among individual suffer premature cardiac event within UK . Following score registry , study also examine relationship cholesterol survival premature event order understand possible ramification untreated FH patient survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Familial Hypercholesterolaemia ( FH ) genetic disorder cause mutation low-density lipoprotein receptor ( LDL-R ) gene . Individuals suffer FH experience elevate cholesterol level outside accepted range healthy cholesterol level . When leave untreated FH may cause complication cardiovascular health may cause premature cardiac event . Current screen method disease successfully diagnose majority FH case . This study apply three clinical diagnostic tool -- Dutch Lipid Clinic Network Criteria ( DLCN-Criteria ) , Make Early Diagnosis Prevent Early Deaths ( MEDPED ) criterion , Simon Broome Register Criteria -- within national registry order define possible , probable , definite case FH . The national registry use study Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project ( MINAP ) National Audit Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( BCIS ) audit . Following score patient , one-year 30-day survival model create order ass effect elevate cholesterol survival , suspect FH patient elevate cholesterol level . Data within MINAP range 2003-2013 data BCIS range 2007-2014 . Patient information within audit collect follow admission English Welsh hospital follow coronary event percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Information related survival mortality collect annually within audit . Participants study experience premature cardiovascular event coronary intervention ( men &lt; 55 woman &lt; 60 ) .</detailed_description>
