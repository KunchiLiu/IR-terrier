	<detailed_description>The goal pilot study test different approach monitor medication adherence hypertension patient , leverage NIH-funded Way Health platform . Patients poor blood pressure control recruit University Pennsylvania Health System offer remote monitoring electronic pill bottle bidirectional text messaging . Our aim analyze compare effect remote monitor electronic pill bottle versus bidirectional messaging blood pressure reduction 4 month . Patients randomize 2:2:1 Arm A ( electronic pill bottle ) , Arm B ( bidirectional messaging ) , Arm C ( usual care ) . A total 150 participant enrol study , 60 intervention arm 30 control . After 4 month patient complete in-person follow-up blood pressure measurement end program survey . We monitor patient 's medical record additional 8 month intervention track blood pressure measurement number outpatient visit . Accrual : Participants study patient treat within UPHS health system . They identify via daily electronic medical record review study staff . The study staff work UPHS create filter electronic medical record system generate monthly list patient may meet study criterion . A study coordinator review list patient determine eligibility . If patient meet minimal requirement add study screen data base contact via recruitment letter 3 follow-up phone call . The intervention study 4 month date consent , additional 8 month follow-up , passively monitor visit utilization blood pressure electronic medical record . After patient enrolls message send PCP via EPIC notify physician patient enrol study . At conclusion intervention , participant complete in-person blood pressure measurement post-study survey . Information BP measurement record EPIC message send PCP research BP measurement include . Analysis Plan : The primary outcome systolic blood pressure 4 month visit , control initial systolic blood pressure . Additional outcome include , percent normotensive , recruitment attrition rate , patient perception intervention survey . We also track BP measurement EMR obtain usual care well utilization PCP visit , MPM messaging , phone call . We also compare medication adherence patient electron pill bottle patient bidirectional messaging . Assuming 5.3mmHg standard deviation SBP ( give variability BP time ) two-sided significance level 0.017 ( accommodate three pairwise comparison ) , sample size 60 intervention arm 30 control arm provide 80 % power detect difference SBP reduction 3.75 mmHg either intervention usual care , difference SBP reduction 3.1 mmHg AdhereTech bidirectional text messaging arm . Data Safety : Paper-based record keep secure location accessible personnel involve study . Computer-based file make available personnel involve study use access privilege password . Prior access study-related information , personnel require sign statement agree protect security confidentiality identifiable information . Wherever feasible , identifier remove study-related information . Precautions place ensure data secure use password encryption , research involve web-based survey .</detailed_description>
