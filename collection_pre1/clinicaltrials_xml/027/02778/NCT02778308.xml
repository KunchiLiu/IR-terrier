	<detailed_description>Carcinoma gallbladder commonest malignancy biliary tract . United state incidence 1/100000.Higher incidence note Chile , Mexico Southwest American Indians . It third common malignancy India . The disease may mimic benign disease presentation . Now 78-85 % case may detect preoperatively radiological imaging . 1-3 % carcinoma gall bladder may detect incidentally . Up 1/3rd patient may present jaundice 7 % resectable . With aggressive surgical resection , actuarial 5 year survival 83 % stage II disease 63 % stage III report . Treatment choice complete surgical resection . The role chemotherapy radiotherapy well document treatment gallbladder cancer . Because propensity gallbladder carcinoma spread regional lymph node early stage high rate loco regional recurrence , adjuvant chemotherapy chemo-radiotherapy seem rational therapeutic option . The chemotherapy base 5 Fluorouracil without radiotherapy . Gemcitabine without Cisplatin increasingly use . In recent paper Gemcitabine Cisplatin find effective gemcitabine alone provide definite survival advantage progression free survival . An early randomized trial do assess efficacy adjuvant chemotherapy pancreato-biliary cancer report improvement disease free overall 5 year survival . But study include patient suboptimal resection pancreato-biliary malignancy . In view observation study design assess efficacy chemotherapy adjuvant set gallbladder cancer patient undergone curative resection .</detailed_description>
