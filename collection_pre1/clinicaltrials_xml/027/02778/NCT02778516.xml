	<brief_summary>Dietary sodium intake independently increase risk mortality end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . It play significant role hypertension , hypervolemia , leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) , blunts effectiveness hypertensive agent . In addition , hypervolemia associate excessive dietary sodium intake result need intense fluid removal dialysis ( ultrafiltration ) , result symptom pain , cramp , hypotension , nausea , vomit hemodialysis ( HD ) treatment session . Although sodium restriction universal recommendation ESRD management , National Kidney Foundation ( NKF ) recommendation 2400 mg/day consensus-based per Dietary Approaches Stop Hypertension ( DASH ) study , evidence-based recommendation data derive dialysis population . In addition , The Dietary Guidelines Americans 2010 , recommend restriction dietary sodium intake 1500 mg per day person hypertension and/or kidney disease , middle-aged older adult , African Americans , though also little empiric evidence support recommendation general population none dialysis population . Therefore , remain demonstrated diet sodium restriction attainable , sustainable , safe beneficial . The investigator propose double blind randomized control design investigation examine feasibility assess effect three level sodium intake ( ambient , 2400 mg/d , 1500 mg/d ) hemodialysis ( HD ) participant symptom profile , compare effect hemodialysis-specific variable participant symptom profile dialysis well explore role body fluid composition use bioimpedance ( BIA ) measurement among three sodium-restricted group marker sodium restriction efficacy .</brief_summary>
