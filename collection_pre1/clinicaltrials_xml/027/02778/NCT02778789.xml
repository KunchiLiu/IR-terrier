	<brief_summary>Comparing structural effect TNFi tocilizumab periarticular bone perform comprehensive analysis periarticular bone change RA patient treat either TNFi tocilizumab longitudinal Setting , use high-resolution peripheral quantitative compute tomography ( HR-pQCT ) , sensitive method visualize quantify bone microstructure RA patient . Quantitatively assess change erosion volume , osteophytes size area cortical fenestration group TNFi-treated group tocilizumab- treat RA patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inhibition tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) interleukin- 6 receptor ( IL-6R ) emerge highly effective cytokine block strategy treatment rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) last year . Both , inhibition TNF-α ( TNFi ) interleukin-6 receptor tocilizumab ameliorate sign symptom , reverse elevate acute phase response inhibit progression bone erosion RA patient ( 1 ) . Despite striking similarity respect efficacy safety treatment RA , TNFi tocilizumab two entirely distinct approach target chronic inflammatory disease human . This concept highlight differential response TNFi tocilizumab chronic inflammatory disease psoriasis , psoriatic arthritis spondyloarthritis , clinical efficacy former latter treatment modality ( 2 ) . On hand , tocilizumab direct effect acute phase response iron metabolism , find TNFi . Therefore , subtle difference may exist TNFi tocilizumab , relevant long-term treatment RA patient .</detailed_description>
