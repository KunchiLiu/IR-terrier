	<brief_summary>This study perform assess certain chronic disability - stroke , upper extremity ( UE ) amputation , spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , cerebral palsy ( CP ) - differ healthy subject ability perform ADLs . By study kinematics respective cohort study participant assess perform common activity daily live ( ADLS ) , investigator research team aim good understand impaired neural pathway , pathway impair various point along pathway , deleteriously affect ADLs patient differ long-term disability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cross-sectional study compare bilateral ADL activity stroke survivor , SCI paraplegic , UE amputees , adult CP , healthy control . The study participant perform 4 ADL task BiAS passive robot . From task , BiAS robots provide information regard position , velocity , distance , displacement , etc . This , along video information provide 3D Kinect EEG neuroheadset , use basis investigator data aid inform member research team respective impairment affect upper limb kinematics ADL task . Participation study include follow step : 1 . Informed Consent : After arrival , subject review sign consent form study personnel present . 2 . Pre-Assessments : A member research team evaluate subject ' upper extremity ass ability use . Subjects evaluate use battery assessment , limited , Box Block , Pin Prick , grip strength use dynamometer . 3 . Break : Subjects give 15 minute break . 4 . BiAS passive robot system : Subjects introduce device wrist place end robot . As common therapy task perform subject , BiAS device collect data along video 3D Kinect , ECG gel electrode , EEG neuroheadset . After 4 ADL activity , subject ask level exercise discomfort , . After subject finish exercise BiAS , thank participation study . 5 . Video photo may collect determine subject quality ADL movement .</detailed_description>
