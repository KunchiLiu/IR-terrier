	<brief_title>Pain Reduction With Intranasal Medications Extremity Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inadequate pain control , especially emergency department ( ED ) , major public health concern . Despite increased awareness , pain continue underdiagnosed undertreated , particularly pediatric population . Children often encounter long delay medication administration , possibly due time require obtain intravenous access . The intranasal administration route offer efficient alternative faster noninvasive delivery pain medication . This route gain popularity secondary rapid onset active , minimal discomfort relative simplicity . Opioids commonly use class analgesic pain medication child present severe pain due traumatic injury . Despite potential effectiveness , opioids several concern adverse effect , particularly administer prior procedural sedation child . Administration pre-procedural sedation opioids associate increase risk serious adverse event ( oxygen desaturation , apnea , hypotension ) well need significant intervention , bag-mask ventilation , intubation , pharmacologic blood pressure support . In addition , due genetic variation may lead increase diminished opioid sensitivity , ideal dose adequately control severe pain yet avoid adverse medication-related side effect difficult ascertain . Many child severe pain receive opioids , receive dos recommend experience long delay receive opioids . The reason unclear , investigator speculate may due part fear adverse effect opioids , provider inexperience opioid use child fear contribute opioid tolerance abuse . For reason , provider often seek non-opioid alternative pediatric patient acute , severe pain . Ketamine , sub-dissociative dos administer intravenous intranasal route , emerge alternative medication treatment moderate severe pain multiple setting . In adult , low dose ketamine well tolerate use successfully adjuvant alternative opioids provide rapid pain relief ED . As dissociative anesthetic , ketamine commonly use agent facilitate painful procedure pediatric emergency department . At low dos , use child provide analgesia variety acute chronic pain setting , include terminal diagnosis , sickle cell disease , perioperative pain , traumatic injury , extensive burn condition opioids contraindicate . Similar adult , ketamine use via intranasal route provide adequate analgesia sedation child pre-hospital set undergoing procedure . The objective study compare intranasal sub-dissociative ketamine intranasal fentanyl treatment acute pain associate traumatic limb injury child present ED document objective respiratory side effect profile utilize noninvasive capnometry . If find effective analgesic , intranasal ketamine would particularly useful child experience adverse effect opioids , develop opioid tolerance result chronic painful condition , poor opioid sensitivity due genetic predisposition pediatric trauma patient potential hypotension . Additionally , patient require procedural sedation fracture reduction , avoid opioids early emergency department visit may decrease sedation recovery time risk serious adverse event sedation .</detailed_description>
