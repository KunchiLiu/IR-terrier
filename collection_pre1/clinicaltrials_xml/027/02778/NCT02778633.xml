	<brief_title>Mean Systemic Filling Pressure Heart Performance Predicting Fluid Responsiveness Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The assessment cardiovascular state critically ill patient subject difficulty term fact several hemodynamic parameter , example mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) cardiac output ( CO ) supply insufficient information circulating volume cardiac performance . There clinical need adequate determination intravascular volume status therefore reliable predictor fluid responsiveness highly relevant . However , determine fluid status patient , lack appreciation venous side circulation persist today , greatly due inability appropriately assess venous side circulation . The importance venous part circulation moreover reflect fact increase venous resistance reduce CO many time similar increase arterial resistance . Mean systemic filling pressure ( Pms ) , defined pressure equal pressure would measure heart suddenly stop pumping ( arterial venous ) pressure entire circulatory system bring equilibrium instantaneously , good , complete reliable reflection total intravascular fluid compartment . Passive leg raise ( PLR ) represent `` self-volume challenge '' predicts preload responsiveness transient hemodynamic change venous return directly monitor ventilated patient , provide intact circulation , order test amount volume responsiveness .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must older 18 year , must equip pulsecontour cardiac output system central venous catheter . Patients subsequently connect hemodynamic monitoring device Navigator™ . In patient clinical sign inadequate tissue perfusion , passive leg raise standardized fluid challenge perform . Patients assist device ( e.g . intra aortic balloon pump , Impella® , ECMO ) , patient arrhythmias ( either atrial ventricular ) exclude study . Also , patient inguinal impairment contraindication passive leg raising exclude ( deep venous thrombosis elastic compression stock ) , head trauma , increase intraabdominal pressure suspect clinical context examination well patient absolute contraindication fluid challenge .</criteria>
