	<detailed_description>Background Fecal incontinence ( FI ) affect self-confidence lead social isolation even loss employment Often conservative treatment first option ineffective surgical intervention follow conservative necessary . Small defect anal sphincter muscle might treat sphincter repair sacral neuromodulation ( SNM ) However , patient rarely become fully continent short-term result deteriorate long term . Those patient patient large defect candidate neosphincter procedure ( artificial bowel sphincter graciloplasty ) . However , success rate method limit explantation rate high . A permanent colostomy associate massive psychosocial impairment remain ultimate treatment option With project Smart Muscle Incontinence Treatment ( SMIT ) multidisciplinary consortium consist representative range clinical medicine via microelectronics towards biomaterial science aim develop novel implant treat faecal incontinence . The aim campaign include development implantable prototype device act artificial continence muscle use low-voltage electrically activate polymer ( EAPs ) control implemented pressure sensor patient . Subsequently , knowledge anatomical biomechanical property anal sphincter complex cardinal importance . Most exist data anatomy physiology result base old study almost data biomechanical property available . However , new technology even merge data different examination method might provide new information field . Accurate image data pelvic floor region crucial development new , implantable device restoration fecal continence . Optimal size ( inner , out diameter , length ) geometrical shape ( cylinder , cone , torus ) adapt different functional state ( rest , squeeze , defecation ) improve function prevent erosion consequent infection prosthesis . With study , investigator aim correlate three-dimensional endoanal ultrasonographic image MRI image . The combination different image technique demonstrate eliminate individual drawback examination method therefore would allow precise description tissue . The registered data complementary information would permit distinct segmentation three-dimensional presentation anatomical structure pelvic area . This information great potential facilitate diagnostics surgical plan region . High-resolution anal manometry ( HRAM ) provide intra-anal pressure rest maximum pressure high spatial time resolution . However Biomechanical property anal canal elasticity stiffness ( compliance flexibility ) tissue represent important parameter continence organ routinely evaluate daily clinical practice . Functional Lumen Imaging Probe ( FLIP ) allow measurement cross sectional area ( CSA ) respect apply luminal pressure , respectively . FLIP potential useful order ass biomechanical property sphincter region . Such information potentially give new insight physiology pathophysiology continence process . With pilot study , investigator aim acquire anatomical biomechanical data use establish ( manometry ) novel technology ( merge endoanal ultrasound MRI data ) 50 patient suffer Fecal Incontinence . Objective Primary objective collect anatomical , physiological biomechanical characteristic continence organ ( sphincter pelvic floor ) patient suffer fecal incontinence compare data data gather earlier study ( NCT02263170 ) healthy volunteer . Secondary objective : test feasibility FLIP measure biomechanical property anal canal test feasibility merge 3D US data MR image . Methods For assessment morphology ultra sound MRI use , whereas FLIP ( functional luminance image probe ) HRAM ( high resolution anal manometry ) modality choice investigate biomechanical property sphincter complex .</detailed_description>
