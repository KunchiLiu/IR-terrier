	<brief_title>My Cardiac Recovery ( MyCaRe ) : A Pilot RCT .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The early transition period post coronary artery bypass graft surgery one associate intense physiological psychosocial adjustment require patient make sustainable long-term lifestyle change . Cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) evidence-based risk reduction program show improve overall fitness quality life well low morbidity mortality patient coronary artery disease . Therefore , development supportive strategy bridge gap acute care CR early intervention cardiac surgery patient essential . MyCardiacRecovery ( MyCaRe ) interactive platform include standardized educational format interactive tracking ( wound heal activity progression use photo capability Fitbit flex accelerometer ) support first 6 8 week post hospital discharge . This application help patient family navigate way continuum care provide : ) integrate link acute care outpatient cardiac rehab efficient coordination information reduction duplication service ; b ) patient care education material design address salient recovery question ; c ) improve communication patient care provider , ) ensure streamline systematic referral CR . This innovative strategy potential positively impact patient satisfaction , improve patient outcome possibly minimize financial constraint place health care system . Phase 1 ( preliminary usability test ) prototype 1.0 complete . Phase 2 focus test MyCaRe 2.0 sample post cardiac surgery patient use pilot randomize controlled trial design . Protocol Summary : App Study Phase 2 - Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial N= 40 ( 20 usual care + intervention ; 20 usual care ) Study Population : Post cardiac surgery patient population 1 acute care cardiac centre Toronto Study Design Pilot Randomized control trial Study Duration May 2016 - Dec 2017 Study Agent/ Intervention MyCaRe prototype ( mobile application ) Primary Objectives : 1 ) To examine effect MyCaRe application enrolment CR post cardiac surgery comparison usual care ( assess effectiveness intervention ) ; Secondary Objectives : 2 ) To examine impact MyCaRe application patient recovery satisfaction ( i.e . knowledge level , perception recovery outcomes activity progression , quality life , anxiety depression ) 3 ) To examine effect MyCaRe application health service use . 4 ) To examine patient clinician satisfaction , specifically user ease , usability comfort MyCaRe application .</detailed_description>
