	<detailed_description>Purpose The purpose study assess efficacy anti-IL 17 treatment ( secukinumab ) patient know severe allergic contact dermatitis ( ACD ) . Background ACD immune mediate disease characterize itching , erythema , vesicle , thicken scaly skin , affect large part population world . A review study 2007 Thyssen et al summarizes study North Europe North America 1966-2007 suggests prevalence least one allergen among population 21.2 % ( range 12.5-40.6 % ) ( 1 ) . The incidence ACD static differs country ( 1 ) , recent year increase incidence ACD cause increase number environmental detergent ( 2 , 3 ) . For patient severe ACD disease associate difficulty perform daily activity , loss sleep reduce life quality ( DLQI ) ( 4 ) . ACD treat moisturize cream , topical steroid severe case systemic steroid , UVB , PUVA , azathioprin alitretinoin . However , drug severe side effect patient ACD respond already exist treatment . New treatment therefore highly need . A group patient suffer severe eczema often result impared lifestyle seldom loss work ( 4 ) . The pathogenesis ACD T-cell mediate delayed type hypersensitivity reaction , consist sensitization elicitation phase ( 5 ) . In sensitization phase exogen allergen ( hapten ) enter epidermis defect skin barrier . The allergen present Langerhans cell CD4+ CD8+ T-cells lymphatic node , activate increase number T-cells . The elicitation phase begin patient contact allergen . The T-cells react allergen release cytokine IFN-ɣ follow skin lesion inflammation . The IFN-ɣ important inflammatory cytokine , produce CD4+ CD8+ T-cells ACD human mice ( 6 , 7 ) . However , last decades study reveal inflammatory cytokine , IL-17 IL-22 may importance immune response contact allergen ( 8-11 ) . IL-17 produced T-helper ( TH ) 17 cell , innate cell macrophages dendrit cell cell type ( 12 ) . In mice CD4+ CD8+ T-cells produce IL-17 identify ( 13 ) . A study Nakae et al IL-17 deficient mouse generate exposed dinitroflorobenzene trinitrochlorobenzene , mutant markedly reduce ear swelling compare wild-type mouse , suggest IL-17 play role contact allergy ( 14 ) . In nickel allergic human , CD4+ CD8+ T-cells show produce IL-17 increase number IL-17 produce cell find tissue eczematous reaction ( 8 ) . Our group others find nickel-specific Th1 Th17 cell individual nickel allergy , healthy control ( 8 , 9 ) . Our hypothesis since IL-17 appear involve human ACD , anti-IL-17 treatment ( secukinumab ) might beneficial effect patient ACD . This study evaluate secukinumab treatment patient know allergic contact dermatitis . The study interventional type consist two part perform Department Dermato-allergology , Herlev Gentofte Hospital , University Copenhagen , Hellerup , Denmark . Study 1 Study 1 include 10 patient know allergy nickel , low grade eczema inclusion . Before enrollment patient screen eligibility ( blood sample ( 8-10 ml ) , Quantiferon TB Gold test , urine test infection/pregnancy chest x-ray ensure evidence infection and/or malignancy ) ( 15 ) . The patient test two standard patch test nickel vehicle upper inner arm confirm allergy . A photo biopsy ( 4 mm ) patch test area take , clinical examination skinfold measure evaluate grade dermatitis perform . The response assess clinically ( 48 h , 72 h day 7 ) application grade negative ( - ) , doubtful ( ? + ) , 1+ , 2+ , 3+ 4+ use modify version International Contact Dermatitis Research ( ICDRG ) score system . Patients receive 300 mg secukinumab s.c. injection ( autoinjector ) single dose , administer nurse Department Dermato-allergology , Gentofte Hospital . After one week patient retested nickel , photo biopsy patch test area take , clinical examination skinfold measure perform evaluate efficacy secukinumab . The study comprise 8 visit total include screen Study 2 Study 2 include 10 patient two know allergic contact allergy clinically moderate severe ( PGA≥3 ) allergic contact dermatitis inclusion . Patients treat open label 8 week . Before enrollment patient screen eligibility ( blood sample ( 20-25 ml ) , Quantiferon TB Gold test , urine test infection/pregnancy chest x-ray ensure evidence infection and/or malignancy ) ( 15 ) . Clinical degree dermatitis evaluate use Physician Global Assessment score ( PGA ) instrument severity eczema follow PGA level : clear , almost clear , mild , moderate , severe . Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI , appendix 1 ) Patient 's Global Assessment score ( PtGA , appendix 2 ) measure photo eczema take . When test result baseline clinical procedure ready ( 7-14 day screen visit ) patient eligible inclusion biopsy take ( 4 mm , eczema ) , PGA , PtGA DLQI perform photo eczema take . This consider baseline . Afterwards treatment 300 mg secukinumab s.c. injection ( autoinjector ) initiate first dose administer nurse Department Dermato-allergology , Gentofte Hospital . During first four week patient treat secukinumab week . After period secukinumab administer month last dose give week 8 . All dose secukinumab besides first dose self-administered patient . Two four week baseline another biopsy take , PGA , PtGA DLQI perform photo eczema take evaluate efficacy secukinumab . At week 4 another blood sample ( 12 ml ) take ( cytokine level ( IFN-ɣ IL-17 ) evaluate ) Eight twelve week baseline , PGA , PtGA DLQI perform photo take evaluate efficacy secukinumab . A follow visit perform 16 week baseline relapse , PGA , PtGA , DLQI safety treatment free week explore . The study comprise 7 visit total include screening</detailed_description>
