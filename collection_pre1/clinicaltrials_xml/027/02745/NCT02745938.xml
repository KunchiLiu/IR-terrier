	<brief_summary>Mitochondrial disorder group inherit disorder cause malfunctional mitochondrion . Mitochondria find every cell body , disorder therefore give symptom every tissue , especially high energy need brain , heart muscle . The symptom often unspecific term muscle weakness fatigue , delay first contact doctor delay diagnosis . The aim study investigate possible use GDF-15 ( Growth Differentiation Factor 15 ) biomarker mitochondrial disease compare result healthy control , metabolic myopathy muscular dystrophy . The concentration relative exercise investigate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Energy insufficiency : Mitochondrial metabolic myopathy inherit disease compromise cellular energy metabolism , especially affect skeletal muscle high energy need . Chemical energy store body adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , derive different source include breakdown carbohydrate , lipid purine nucleotide . In respiratory chain inner mitochondrial membrane , ATP release oxidative phosphorylation . Any genetic disorder affect step production energy , storage breakdown glycogen lipid transport conversion substrate , manifest energy insufficiency affect tissue . Mutations gene encode enzyme lipid carbohydrate metabolism result metabolic myopathy mutation enzyme complexes respiratory chain result mitochondrial disorder . Mitochondrial disorder : Mitochondrial disorder cause mutation either mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) nuclear DNA ( nDNA ) lead impaired function respiratory chain reduce energy generation . The disorder derive mtDNA mutation maternally inherit , nDNA mutation autosomal recessively dominantly inherit . Mitochondrial disorder present wide range symptom syndromes depend mutation mutation load tissue . Symptoms usually arise brain , nerve , skeletal cardiac muscle , tissue high energy demand . The patient may suffer muscle weakness , exercise intolerance , impaired balance coordination , seizure , learn deficit , impaired vision , hear loss heart defect . Age disease onset varies disease debut throughout life . The prevalence general 6.2/100.000 birth . Metabolic myopathy : Metabolic myopathies either inherit autosomal recessively , dominantly , X-linked occur spontaneously . Metabolic myopathy cause defective enzyme lipid metabolism ( Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders ) , glycogen glucose metabolism ( Glycogenoses ) common feature compromise energy generation affect tissue , especially muscle . Symptoms vary , patient suffer exercise intolerance , muscle contracture , progressive muscle weakness heart- respiratory failure . If symptoms start childhood , disease often severe may present acute metabolic decompensation , hypoketotic hypoglycemia , encephalopathy risk coma death . The prevalence incidence uncertain , since might many patient diagnose . With increased awareness newborn screen program , patient diagnose survive metabolic decompensation . Growth Differentiation Factor 15 diagnostic tool : Since symptom mitochondrial disorder metabolic myopathy unspecific , easily mistake i.e . cardiopulmonary disease diagnosis difficult . Therefore , would useful biomarker could easily distinguish disorder others . A recent study show Growth Differentiation Factor 15 ( GDF-15 ) significantly elevate blood patient affect mitochondrial disorder compare healthy individual , unknown whether increase specific mitochondrial disease . Thus unknown GDF-15 level patient muscle disease , include metabolic myopathy energy deficiency , mitochondrial disease , also present . GDF-15 belongs transform growth factor beta super family growth factor regulate inflammation apoptosis injured tissue . It known GDF-15 elevate , suggest oxidative stress , part pathophysiology mitochondrial disorder , increase GDF-15 activation P53 . Oxidative stress also play role pathophysiology metabolic myopathy [ 8 ] , GDF-15 may therefore elevated patient . To make sure GDF-15 elevate due muscle involvement , also measure subgroup muscular dystrophy . AIM In study , wish investigate : 1. measurement GDF-15 use biomarker mitochondrial myopathy distinguish patient healthy person . 2. elevate GDF-15 also sign either metabolic myopathy muscle dystrophy exclusively detect mitochondrial disease . 3. GDF-15 concentration mitochondrial metabolic myopathy varies metabolic demand increase exercise . 4. GDF-15 concentration correlate oxidative capacity ( VO2max ) patient mitochondrial myopathy . We investigate concentration GDF-15 blood sample patient affect mitochondrial disorder compare concentration patient affect metabolic myopathy , muscular dystrophy group healthy control . If significant difference , GDF-15 may sensitive biomarker mitochondrial disorder . We investigate maximal oxidative capacity maximal workload capacity study relate concentration GDF-15 . METHODS : 30 subject mitochondrial disorder , 25 metabolic myopathy , 25 muscular dystrophy 25 healthy control recruit . A blood sample take , GDF-15 muscle marker measure . 10-15 subject mitochondrial disorder , 10-15 metabolic myopathy 10-15 healthy individual investigate exercise test , blood sample take afterwards .</detailed_description>
