	<brief_summary>Acetate primary acidify solution use bicarbonate-based hemodialysis worldwide . It publish small trial case series addition acetate associate rise nitric oxide production vascular smooth muscle cell , endothelial cell myocardial cell sign vascular dysfunction . Furthermore clinical side effect dialysis e.g . nausea , malnutrition , intradialytic blood pressure drop , induction proinflammatory cytokine activation complement leukocytes described acetate . Citrate hand associate : Acid-base disorder ( metabolic alkalosis ) , Disturbances calcium homeostasis ( Hypocalcemia ) , also anti-inflammatory effect . Both dialysate additive ( citrate acetate ) commercially available used world wide dialysis center . The investigator hypothesize substitution acetate citrate reduces cardiovascular risk ( measure change surrogate parameter pulse wave velocity Augmentation index ) might improve quality life participant . Furthermore investigator speculate citrate dialysis solution could reduce systemic inflammation participant study .</brief_summary>
