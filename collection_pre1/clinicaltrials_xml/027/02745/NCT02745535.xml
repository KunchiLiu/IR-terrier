	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety , tolerability , efficacy sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir ( SOF/VEL/VOX ) adults chronic hepatitis C infection fail eradicate hepatitis C despite previous combination directly act antiviral therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The treatment chronic Hepatitis C combination directly act antiviral agent ( DAAs ) represent dramatic improvement previous therapy safety , tolerability efficacy , therapy universally effective . Some patient fail achieve sustain virologic response ( SVR ) follow therapy combination DAAs , yet ideal retreatment strategy patient yet determine . As DAA medication become widely available outside clinical trial setting , important evaluate retreatment strategy patient fail combination DAA therapy , regardless whether virologic failure , post-treatment relapse , discontinue treatment prematurely . The RESOLVE study evaluate safety , tolerability , efficacy treatment fix dose combination sofosbuvir ( approve NS5B inhibitor ) , velpatasvir ( formerly GS-5816 , second generation NS5A inhibitor ) voxilaprevir ( formerly GS-9857 , investigational NS3/4A protease inhibitor ) HCV infect patient early advance liver disease , include HIV hepatitis B , fail previous combination DAA therapy . Patients early stage compensate cirrhosis receive 12 week therapy , follow adverse event SVR follow completion therapy . RESOLVE aid understand determinant response re-treatment combination DAA therapy - With without cirrhosis - In patient HCV GT1 subtypes b - In patient previously fail DAA therapy - With without HIV hepatitis B RESOLVE also examine factor associate treatment response , include - viral pharmacokinetics patient receive combination SOF/VEL/VOX , patient without cirrhosis - differential interferon sensitive gene response - host genetic proteomic factor - evolution HCV quasispecies resistance associate variant baseline response therapy - change host HCV-specific immunity patient without advanced liver disease</detailed_description>
