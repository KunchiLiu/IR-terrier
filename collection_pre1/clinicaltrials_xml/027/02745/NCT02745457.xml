	<brief_summary>Background : Growth impairment commonly see child diagnose inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , mainly Crohn 's disease ( CD ) . There general consensus literature body composition , compose fat mass lean mass alter child IBD compare control . Evidence regard effect different therapeutic approach body composition child IBD scarce inconsistent . Furthermore , study use anthropometric measure dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) body composition assessment , information usefulness air displacement plethysmography ( ADP ) assessment lack . Objectives : To assess body composition child IBD ADP DEXA diagnosis various interval follow . Design : A prospective cohort study . Setting : Pediatric gastroenterology institute , Schneider Children 's Hospital . Participants : Children 6 year 17 year diagnose either CD ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . Main outcome measure : Accuracy ADP comparison DEXA percentage fat mass lean mass diagnosis treatment . Secondary outcome measure : Correlation body composition skin fold , mid arm circumference measurement , BMI , inflammatory marker , gender , disease activity physical activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Children diagnose either Crohn 's disease ( CD ) Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) follow-up Pediatric gastroenterology institute , Schneider Children 's Hospital , enrol . Patients enrol diagnosis time point follow-up . Patients ' characteristic retrieve medical file include demographic detail , disease phenotype , anthropometric measure , laboratory evaluation , complication therapeutic regimen . At enrollment patient perform body composition assessment air displacement plethysmography ( ADP ) DEXA ( great 7 day 2 method measurement ) . At one two year follow initial assessment ADP measurement repeat , mid arm circumference skin fold measurement take patient fill physical activity questionnaire . Disease activity score ( either Pediatric Crohn 's Disease Activity Index CD Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index UC ) calculate . Similar evaluation perform prior immediately follow exclusive enteral nutrition corticosteroid course prior biologic therapy initiation .</detailed_description>
