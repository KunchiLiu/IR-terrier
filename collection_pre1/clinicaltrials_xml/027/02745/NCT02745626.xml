	<brief_summary>Orthodontic treatment traditionally carry fixed appliance involve use stainless steel bracket archwires . The challenge move teeth root effectively minimize iatrogenic damage root resorption gingival inflammation . In recent year , development new appliance bracket self-ligating bracket clear aligners report improve periodontal status , less iatrogenic root damage improve hygiene treatment . Although treatment modality rapidly accept clinical practice , clinical basic science research data regard overall biological compatibility support high level evidence base dentistry ( e.g , randomized clinical trial ) lack . In word , advantage disadvantage regard yet scientifically evaluate . Such quantification provide invaluable information improvement treatment modality . A randomized controlled clinical trial conduct strict inclusion exclusion criterion test follow hypothesis ( H ) 18 month treatment : H-1 : There difference amount root resorption cause three different appliance . H-2 : Gingival health affect 'type appliance ' use correct malocclusion . H-3 : There difference amount bacterial count type appliance use orthodontic treatment . The hypothesis test follow specific aim ( SA ) : SA-1 : To investigate amount orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption generate treatment . SA-2 : To evaluate periodontal health patient different appliance system . SA-3 : To determine change Streptococcus mutans total bacterial count contain plaque orthodontic patient . SA-4 : To ascertain whether association microbial count type appliance use orthodontic treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Oral Hygiene &amp; Root Resorption During Orthodontic Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Importance research Orthodontic treatment longer limit mainly child adolescent . With increase number patient old age group seek orthodontic treatment ; increase demand esthetic alternative conventional fixed stainless steel appliance . Some issue associate conventional fixed appliance treatment : 1 ) unaesthetic appearance bracket especially adult patient , many unwilling wear brace , 2 ) conventional system compromise ability patient maintain good oral hygiene ; 3 ) increase risk periodontal breakdown due constant accumulation plaque around bracket , wire ill-fitting band ; 4 ) require many follow-up visit appliance reactivation adjustment teeth move desire ; 5 ) iatrogenic root resorption , major medico-legal concern also pose significant problem clinician . Increased use self-ligating bracket clear aligners Invisalign ( Align Technology , Inc. , Santa Clara , CA ) recent development orthodontics try address concern . However clinical evidence highlight efficacy quiet forthcoming . Present knowledge primarily base upon case report , case series , survey , anecdotal report retrospective study . In scenario imperative find optimized evidence-based treatment strategy lead predictable outcome complete patient satisfaction treatment minimize risk root resorption periodontal breakdown . RESEARCH DESIGN &amp; METHODS : Screening procedure : The partcipants select Division Orthodontics , Department Craniofacial Sciences , University Connecticut , Health Center two investigator : 1 ) faculty member supervise 'clinical component ' research 2 ) faculty member supervise microbiological radiological part research . Only gain approval faculty member participant select study . The participant parent provide write explanation background study , objective , involvement . In addition consent form routine orthodontic care currently use investigator 's clinic ; patient parent/guardian every participant give second consent form specifically related study . The following inclusion criterion , base previous study investigator 's clinical research experience : 1 . All participant physically healthy relevant allergy medical problem . 2 . All participant ≥ 12 year age . 3 . There less 8mm anterior crowd space adequate buccal interdigitation . Patients posterior edentulous space include treatment entail space closure . 4 . Participants permanent teeth present , except third molar . 5 . Demonstrable ability maintain adequate oral hygiene . 6 . Show optimum dental health without immediate need restoration . Following exclusion criterion : 1 . Skeletal anterior-posterior discrepancy maxilla mandible ( ANB ≥ 5° ) . 2 . Centric relation ( CR ) - Centric occlusion ( CO ) discrepancies great 3 mm . 3 . Anterior posterior open bite . 4 . Participantswho pregnant , diabetic use mouth rinse interact medication , include antibiotic therapy . 5 . Presence active periodontal disease . 6 . Presence impact teeth . 7 . Smoking The participant fulfil criterion randomly assign one treatment group . The statistician project use computer-generated random number ( 'Rand ' function , Microsoft , Excel 2011 ) allocation sequence . This ensure even distribution participant group . Computer generate random number also randomize right left side maxilla select experimental side . Sample size From previous study , inferred mean colony form unit ( CFU ) unit difference approximately one log ( standard deviation ( SD ) = approximately 1 ) would result clinically significant increase S.mutans count . Therefore sample size 15 participant per group , α = 0.05 , yield statistical power approximately 0.80 study . To account 10-25 % patient drop data loss due unavoidable circumstance , enroll 68 patient study . Specific aim # 1 : Measuring gingival health Periodontal measurement record specifically upper maxillary lateral incisor second premolar.One individual take study related periodontal measurement three different time interval : T0 : treatment , T1 : 9 month treatment &amp; T2 : 18 month treatment . During measurement , examiner blind previous score . Prior start research , participant receive standardized oral hygiene instruction ensure healthy periodontium . Goal 1 : Measuring gingival Status The gingival index ( GI ) develop Loe Silness used.Grades severity gingivitis score clinical inspection base size , color , texture gingival margin adjacent bracket bleed probe . Goal 2 : Measuring plaque index ( PI ) The PI assess accord plaque accumulation gingival area four grade guide probe gingivally buccal surface select teeth . Goal 3 : Measuring papillary bleeding index ( PBI ) Bleeding probe ( BOP ) tendency measure proximal buccal side select teeth , 20 second probe depth pocket/gingival sulcus . The PBI assess five grade guide probe carefully along marginal sulcus observe bleed intensity . Specific aim # 2 : Estimating total bacterial Streptococcus mutans count plaque sample . Goal 1 : Collection plaque specimen After isolate teeth saliva cotton roll gently dry prevent contamination , supragingival plaque carefully remove without traumatize gingiva , would increase production gingival crevicular fluid . 52 The plaque-sampling investigator use standardize protocol collect specimens three time interval . Plaque specimens collect labial surface immediately surround orthodontic bracket sterilize dental scaler tip dimension ( # 8/9 Orban DE hoe scaler , Hu-Friedy , Chicago , Ill ) . Because area increase decalcification generally immediately adjacent bracket , four pass , 1 along tooth bracket interface gingival , mesial , distal , occlusal aspect , make avoid overload instrument tip . For invisalign group single circular stroke around center clinical crown make . All specimens tooth place individual tubes anonymous cod sealed transport laboratory . The coding specimen ensure blind laboratory personnel help minimize experimental bias . Goal 2 : Microbial sample Each specimen dilute 2 ml phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) dilute yeast extract sample sonicated 10 sec serial dilution . Then 1 ml submit tenfold serial dilution 9 ml yeast extract . After serial dilution test tube vortexed 10 sec . Ten microlitre ( 10 μl ) supernatant plat onto Tripticase soy agar supplement 5 % sheep bovine blood ( BBL ) total bacterial evaluation mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar specific S. mutans . The sample process within 2 hour plate incubate 24 hour 37°C . The number total CFU ( Colony form unit ) , specific S. mutans identify count blind investigator represent total recoverable facultative flora . Specific aim # 3 : Estimating external apical root resorption ( EARR ) maxillary incisor For patient periapical film maxillary incisor premolars &amp; orthopantographs ( OPG ) take two different time point ( T0 &amp; T2 ) . All periapical film develop similar condition ( Dentax 810 Basic ) scan ruler computer , calibrate measure 1:1 ratio Adobe Photoshop software ( Adobe , San Jose , Calif ) measurement purpose . If require good interpretation image tooth enlarge and/or print . Measuring root resorption Root crown length measure slide caliper near 0.1 mm The enlargement factor second film adjust first film case reference register crown length , assume unchanged orthodontic treatment . The 'rule-of-three formula ' applied calculate root length change due orthodontic treatment . It assume orthodontic treatment crown length change ( unless fracture ) . Therefore , ratio initial crown length ( C1 ) final crown length ( C2 ) determine enlargement factor . If change occur root length treatment , ratio initial root length ( R1 ) final root length ( R2 ) equal C1/C2 ratio . If treatment root shorten , amount OIIRR R1-R2 ( C1/ C2 ) . All research data identify unique identifier ( Patient1 , Patient 2 … ) contain PHI . Specifically , data collect experiment associate participant 's name , medical ID number , identifier , could readily identify participant . All participant data gather transfer immediately secure database data identify unique identifier create participant .</detailed_description>
