	<brief_summary>The goal SOAR characterize clinical economic impact clinician ' response major bleed complication pre-procedural concern bleed risk patient treat oral anticoagulant ( warfarin , anti-Xa oral , anti-thrombin ( IIa ) oral ) present ED hospital acute illness injury , eventual aim inform development improve approach management OACs ED .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Oral Anticoagulants Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose Rationale : Until recently , warfarin oral anticoagulant ( OAC ) available US , substantial infrastructure develop around management . Over past five year , four non-Vitamin-K antagonist oral anticoagulant ( NOAC ) approve FDA . The NOACs associate generally few less severe bleeding complication , short half-lives , often make management bleeding complicates use agent less problematic similar episode associate warfarin . Bleeding NOAC therapy occur , patient take NOACs sometimes require procedure delay , good hemostasis desirable , therefore NOAC may delay complicate care . The challenge latter issue compound lack readily available , rapid-turnaround quantitative assay measure magnitude anticoagulation effect associate NOAC use . From safety perspective , large warfarin infrastructure translate useful support use new NOACs ; anticoagulation impact readily monitor simple , quick test . In October 2015 first specific reversal agent NOAC approve , useful dabigatran ; present , specific reversal agent anti-Xa NOACs . Emergency care provider face many concern insecurity regard safety warfarin NOACs , work highly pressurize care environment , often limited patient history little time consider treatment option . Because unique position hospital ED US healthcare continuum , frequently initial site care patient OACs develop bleed complication . In clinical setting , tend standardized , international normalize ratio ( INR ) -driven pathway management warfarin-related bleeds . Many EDs hospital pharmacy try establish similarly standardize , though evidence-driven , pathways NOAC-related bleeding , eagerly await availability additional specific reversal agent use patient . The ED represent key sentinel surveillance point assess clinical economic impact bleed concern complication attributable OAC therapy . Other bleed issue impact pace nature medical surgical care occur inpatient setting , especially ICU surgical suite . Taken together , hospital setting ( ED plus inpatient ) offer 360-degree view scope , significance , cost OAC-related bleeds bleed concern . This registry propose large , prospective , multicenter study identifies clinical economic impact safety concern around OAC use evaluation management strategy ED inpatient unit participate hospital . The eventual aim use data inform gradual development new , protocolized safety standard management OACs ED .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Bleeding require intervention patient must take OAC meet least one follow criterion : Acute bleed potentially lifethreatening presentation Acute bleeding associate fall hemoglobin level ≥2 g/dL Acute bleeding associate hemoglobin level ≤8 g/dL baseline hemoglobin available Acute symptomatic bleeding critical area organ Any intracranial bleeding Bleeding 8 hour direct patient monitoring require prior ED disposition Bleeding intravenous ( IV ) Vitamin K , fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) , prothrombin complex concentrate ( PCC ) activate PCC ( aPCC ) , specific factor replacement reversal agent , parenteral hemostatic agent tranexamic acid administer Bleeding pack red blood cell ( PRBCs ) platelet transfuse 2 . Bleeding Concern patient must take OAC , without overt bleeding , meet least one follow criterion : Diagnostic therapeutic surgical procedure hemostasis desirable ( e.g. , emergency laparotomy ) , opinion treat physician , postpone least 8 hour Diagnostic therapeutic percutaneous procedure hemostasis desirable ( e.g. , lumbar puncture ) , opinion treat physician , postpone least 8 hour Overdose ( deliberate accidental ) one OAC agent , opinion treat physician , require administration Vitamin K , FFP , PCC aPCC , specific factor replacement specific reversal agent , parenteral hemostatic agent tranexamic acid , desire immediate reversal anticoagulation Bleeding concern , opinion treat physician , 8 hour direct patient monitoring require prior ED disposition Patients meet follow criterion eligible inclusion registry study : Those received investigational reversal agent OAC index event ( data patient collect part pertinent investigational study ) .If course SOAR enrollment investigational reversal agent approve , agent use outside registration study , subject exclude . Those received treatment bleed bleed concern another facility immediately prior transfer enrol facility .</criteria>
