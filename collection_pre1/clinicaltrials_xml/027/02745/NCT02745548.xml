	<brief_summary>In order well understand radiation-induced lung toxicity , investigator proposes novel functional avoidance approach incorporate central well peripheral BSS segment treatment planning process order quantify account respective radiosensitivity . Specifically , investigator proposes systematic study involve acquire pre- post-SAbR high-resolution CT SPECT V/Q scan lung cancer patient receive radiotherapy , follow auto-segmentation BSS element use virtual bronchoscopy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Very recent lung cancer therapy positive impact public health lung SAbR . Lung SAbR involve precise administration high , biologically potent dos ( 54-70 Gy ) 3-5 fraction . The recent update Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) 0236 Phase II multi-center lung SAbR trial show 5-year primary tumor control &gt; 90 % inoperable Stage I NSCLC patient tumor ≤ 5cm . However , use highly potent dos put patient risk collateral toxicity include radiation pneumonitis radiation injury airway , cause stenosis , atelectasis ultimately fibrosis . A review 35 early-stage NSCLC SAbR clinical study find report maximum value Grade ≥3 toxicities 10-28 % . In RTOG 0236 trial , 17 % patient present Grade ≥3 toxicity . Furthermore , toxicity show increase dramatically centrally-located and/or large ( &gt; 5cm ) early-stage tumor . Due concern , current clinical practice , use high-dose-per-fraction lung SAbR routinely indicate small percentage ( ~3 - 4 % ) NSCLC population - inoperable , early-stage patient small , peripheral lesion . Inoperable patient early-stage central and/or large tumor , high stage and/or multiple lesion , pulmonary oligometastases ( metastatic disease limit number lesion sit ) either treat conventional radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy ( ~30 - 40 % 5-year survival ) , treat ( median survival ~1 year ) . The segmented structure import clinical radiotherapy treatment planning system order calculate dose individual BSS element . Follow-up CT image follow-up SPECT V/Q scan use characterize radiosensitivity structure spatially map potential radiation-induced loss lung function . Eventually , use information , investigator investigate treatment planning strategy help limit radiation dose consequent damage BSS element , thereby reduce lung toxicity . The investigator hypothesize - Anatomically variable radiation injury bronchial tree pulmonary vasculature important determinant post-SAbR pulmonary toxicity residual pulmonary function .</detailed_description>
