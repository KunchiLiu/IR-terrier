	<detailed_description>This ClinicIMPPACT proposal build upon success IMPPACT project ( Grant No . 223877 , complete February 2012 ) , create model facilitate accurate RFA treatment . This preliminary RFA model test swine , extensive histological workup , clinical simulation study base patient data , report relatively high correlation estimate actual tumor volume . The mapping software liver cancer RFA develop project provide simulator radiologist plan , review optimize procedure . Within IMPPACT , extensive experiment perform pig cell develop micro-scale cellular death model , use calibrate software . After porcine liver calibration , eight patient lesion select database clinical procedure , plan software use retrospectively simulate intervention predict lesion shape . Predicted volume compare real thermal lesion , visualize segment contrast-enhanced CT one month ablation . These comparison show simulated real lesion volume acceptably match take virtual tissue perfusion value account . Some lesion shape mismatch , possibly due inaccuracy segment radiological image . Treatment RFA could improve use validated software solution estimate lesion size identify possible complication advanceâ€”ideally , solution adapt real-time clinical requirement . However , current state art involve long , hardware-intensive computing time ( ~5 hour ) , impractical clinical use . The main goal project develop simulation tool , drive user-friendly , ergonomically optimized graphical user interface , support complex requirement clinician . Therefore , work step international project medical technical partner accelerate simulation speed , optimize needle registration , integrate patient ' individual perfusion value software calculation , well accurate validation technique , produce sophisticated reliable prediction . The software could also aid offline plan simulation RFA teach tool radiologist . Its use retrospective analysis improve clinical follow scientific evaluation .</detailed_description>
