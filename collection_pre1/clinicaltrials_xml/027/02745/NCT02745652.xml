	<detailed_description>Carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) one common peripheral nerve entrapment disorder upper limb . CTS common pregnancy especially third trimester well , significant percentage female postnatal may still complaints least 3 year postnatal . Purpose : To compare effect pulse magnetic field ( PEMF ) versus ultrasound ( US ) treat patient CTS . Forty postnatal female patient idiopathic CTS assign randomly two equal group . One group receive PEMF nerve tendon gliding exercise wrist 3 time week 4 week . The group receive US plus exercise . Pain level , sensory motor distal latency median nerve ( MSDL MMDL ) , sensory motor conduction velocity median nerve ( MSCV MMCV ) , functional status scale hand grip strength assess pre post treatment</detailed_description>
