	<brief_summary>Despite decline fatal traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) incidence recent year , TBI morbidity remain public health challenge lead cause disability United States To combat effect , new research need identify mechanisms injury lead potential target therapeutic intervention improve neurological outcome . One promising area research cerebral metabolic dysfunction follow TBI . Studies post-traumatic cerebral metabolism show cerebral metabolic rate glucose ( CMRglc ) decrease period day , week month injury duration degree hypometabolism correlate level consciousness strong predictor long-term neurological outcome . However , specific change intermediary carbohydrate metabolic pathways yet identify . In addition , role astrocyte metabolism post-injury metabolism study . This study use vivo 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) 3 Tesla , novel method clinical study TBI , non-invasively study metabolic fate flux glucose ( metabolized neuron astrocyte ) acetate ( metabolize astrocyte ) metabolic pathways hypometabolic period . In addition , investigator study association decrease cerebral perfusion change glucose acetate metabolism follow TBI , change cerebral perfusion could profoundly affect cerebral metabolism limit substrate availability .</brief_summary>
