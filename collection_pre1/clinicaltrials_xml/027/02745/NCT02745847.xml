	<brief_title>Re-irradiation With Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Relapsed Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer one lethal malignant tumor , probably attributable local recurrence deem predominant factor influence patient ' prognosis quality life . Only 15 % -20 % patient suitable surgery among first diagnose pancreatic cancer 5-year survival rate patient R0 resection still less 20 % . Therefore , radiotherapy become promise method improve survival . However , due adjacent organ risk , conventional external beam radiotherapy , besides long course , sometimes result severe radiation-induced toxicity , delay initial thereafter treatment , chemotherapy , reduce clinical benefit . A single-fraction dose gross tumor volume could increase stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) . Furthermore , dose organ risk could also reduce , thus effectively improve local control rate reduce radiation relate toxicity . Compared conventional external beam radiotherapy , SBRT prove provide long progression free survival safe combination chemotherapy . Moreover , owe short course low toxicity SBRT , quality life largely improve . However , report progression usually occur 2 year initial treatment . The common failure pattern local recurrence . Chemotherapy supportive treatment commonly use relapse pancreatic cancer unfavored outcome . Palliative surgery perform patient recurrent pancreatic cancer study . Nevertheless , bad medical condition high complication rate , many patient could endure surgery . Therefore , whether patient previously treat SBRT could re-irradiated another challenge treatment pancreatic cancer . Some study confirm improved quality life longer survival could available re-irradiation via SBRT patient relapse pancreatic cancer . Real-time guide synchronous trace SBRT increase dose tumor volume decrease dos organ risk toxicity , render SBRT alternative treatment relapse pancreatic cancer . Chris et al . demonstrate 1-year local control rate 70 % re-irradiation SBRT 14 patient toxicity mild . Nergiz Dagoglu et al . show median overall survival 14 month grade 3 , 4 5 toxicity occur . From 2013-2015 , retrospectively review medical record 14 patient relapse pancreatic cancer re-irradiated SBRT . All tumor marker pain score decrease quality life improve 3 month re-irradiation . Hence , base experience , attempt prospectively evaluate safety efficacy re-irradiation SBRT relapse pancreatic cancer .</detailed_description>
