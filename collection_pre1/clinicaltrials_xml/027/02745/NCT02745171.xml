	<brief_summary>Introduction : Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) result dysfunction dopaminergic system degenerative progressive , change nigrostriatal pathway , decrease concentration dopamine . Has clinical sign , symptom call cardinal engine : rest tremor , bradykinesia , rigidity postural instability . In addition drug therapy , physical therapy also consider useful tool treatment motor disorder disease . The role physiotherapy aim stimulate security independence patient PD carry activity preserve improve physical function . Some study show negative effect disease quality life functional mobility . Few study conduct evaluate effect long-term therapy PD , many report beneficial effect rehabilitation program short period time . Objective : To continually assess effect completion physical therapy program patient Parkinson 's disease . Methods : Type study randomize double blind clinical trial Parkinson Pro Program Hospital Federal University Pernambuco . Will recruit subject PD , sex , stag 1 3 scale Hoehn Yahr score great 18 Mini-Mental . Patients recruit undergo assessment use scale assessment functional mobility , quality life motor examination start physical therapy end treatment two month completion treatment , interval assessment month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Behavior Assessment Effects Physical Therapy Program Patients With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Parkinson 's disease result dysfunction dopaminergic system , cholinergic , serotonergic noradrenergic , though neuropathological basic pattern change nigrostriatal pathway , decrease concentration dopamine level dopamine receptor body striatum . With still little known etiology instance , Parkinson 's disease clinical sign , symptom call cardinal engine : rest tremor , bradykinesia , rigidity postural instability . Additionally , patient may exhibit cognitive deficit emotional change progression disease . The clinical diagnosis primarily base identification cardinal motor symptom plus initial response levodopa therapy . The literature unanimous admit use Levodopa ( L-dopa ) effective drug treatment , administration recommend satisfactory symptom control . In addition drug therapy , physical therapy also consider useful tool treatment motor disorder associate disease . Although speed motor patient learningParkinson 's disease lower control group age , rehabilitation , individual may also acquire motor skill well improve performance practice repetition . Although physical rehabilitation program beneficial improve activity daily live ( ADL ) mobility patient Parkinson 's disease , yet clear long effect sustain . Most clinical trial physiotherapy PD base short-term rehabilitation program . Few study conduct evaluate effect long-term physical therapy Parkinson 's disease , many report beneficial effect short-term rehabilitation program , without concern monitor physical therapy . Thus study aim continuously evaluate behavior effect physical therapy program patient Parkinson 's disease . Knowledge time interval decline gain physiotherapy guide point guide patient regard return service revaluation , also consider fact disease progressive .</detailed_description>
