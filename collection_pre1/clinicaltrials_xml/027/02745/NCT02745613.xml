	<brief_title>Type 2 Diabetes Affect Exercise Induced Improvement Insulin Sensitivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A family history T2D ( FH+ ) risk factor develop insulin resistance ( precedes T2D ) T2D ( Ryder et al. , 2003 ) . Exercise training hand show improve insulin sensitivity highly effective prevent/manage T2D . However know early sign insulin resistance appear clinically diagnose benefit exercise prevent/cure T2D , limit offspring Hispanic T2D parent . Therefore , propose study determine 1 ) normoglycemic ( normal blood glucose ) offspring T2D parent insulin resistant , use gold standard method measure insulin sensitivity metabolic flexibility ( ability switch carbohydrate fat oxidation ) 2 ) 8 week exercise train improves insulin sensitivity metabolic flexibility extent FH+ compare normoglycemic offspring parent without history T2D ( FH- ) 3 ) 8 week exercise training change blood , lipid molecular profile relevant insulin sensitivity extent FH+ compare offspring parent without family history T2D ( FH- ) .</detailed_description>
