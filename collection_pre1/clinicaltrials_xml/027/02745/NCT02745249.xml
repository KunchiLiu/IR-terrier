	<brief_title>Assessing Feasibility Integrating Maternal Nutrition Interventions Into Existing MNCH Platform Bangladesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inadequate maternal nutrition likely undermine potential impact IYCF improvement make Alive &amp; Thrive ( A &amp; T ) first phase link poor fetal growth lead small-for-gestational age pre-term newborn . These baby respond growth promote feeding practice well normal newborn ( WHO Healthy Growth project ) . In study 16,290 singleton infant born rural Bangladesh 2004 2007 , 50 % bear low birth-weight . Low birth-weight risk factor neonatal death , estimate 37 per 1,000 live birth Bangladesh . Factors associate low birth-weight include young maternal age , poor pre-pregnant nutritional status , short birth interval , poor maternal dietary intake ( quality , quantity , diversity ) , inadequate pregnancy weight gain . Better maternal nutrition improve maternal newborn outcome facilitate achievement continuum good nutrition . In set country program goal Bangladesh phase 2 , Alive &amp; Thrive decide focus demonstrate feasibility integrate package maternal nutrition intervention large-scale MNCH program . Maternal nutrition receive equal priority child nutrition A &amp; T program BRAC already develop effective strategy though improve IYCF practice . MNCH program offer best opportunity achieve large scale sustainability . The GOB also promote mainstreaming nutrition intervention health service . Considering behavior change focus Alive &amp; Thrive strategy , effort concentrate improve dietary practice , specifically , improve diversity food energy intake pregnant woman , improve intake calcium iron/folic acid supplement . BRAC 's supply system use ensure access calcium iron/folic acid supplement . The current Government Bangladesh guideline supplement pregnant woman iron folic acid calcium , take food ( minimize adverse effect ) would focus behavior change intervention . The primary objective propose evaluation answer follow question use cluster-randomized evaluation design : - Can coverage utilization key maternal nutrition intervention improve equitably integrate nutrition-focused BCC community mobilization BRAC 's rural MNCH program ? - What factor affect high quality integration nutrition intervention well-established MNCH program platform ? Secondary objective examine follow question : â€¢ Can intensive , formative-research base BCC intervention maternal nutrition improve quality diet pregnant woman rural Bangladesh facilitate well early breastfeeding practice via routine MNCH service ?</detailed_description>
