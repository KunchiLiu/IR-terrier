	<detailed_description>Exogenous erythropoietin ( EPO ) currently use reduce prevent need red blood cell transfusion preterm infant . Just two decade ago , erythropoietin ( EPO ) receptor first identify brain , astrocytes find capable synthesize EPO . Subsequently , find culture hippocampal cerebral cortical neuron expose EPO spar glutamate-induced cell death see neuron expose EPO . Thus begin concept EPO protect brain adversity . Several follow-up study child participate trial recombinant EPO prevention treatment anemia , term newborn encephalopathy , retinopathy prematurity also provide evidence neuroprotective effect . In ELGAN ( Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn ) study , abnormal brain structure function associate intermittent sustain systemic inflammation ( ISSI ) . Since EPO anti-inflammatory property kidney muscle well growth/trophic property , reason elevate circulating level might convey information reduce risk brain damage ELGANs . Although major neurodevelopmental disability cerebral palsy ( CP ) , mental disability , learn attention deficit school age figure prominently outcomes ELBW infant , successful neuroprotective intervention yet develop . Investagators design prospective , randomize , mask study evaluate rhEPO initial hospitalization follow , hypothesize rhEPO recipient would receive few transfusion initial hospitalization extremely preterm infant . Based potential neuroprotection , study design determine whether rhEPO ( 500 u/kg ) also effective improve developmental outcome extremely low gestational age newborn . The neurodevelopmental outcome rhEPO treat extremely preterm infant clear . Investigators propose early-childhood neurodevelopmental follow-up study compare long-term effect rhEPO measure , Bayley Scales Infant Development III . We plan follow extremely low gestational age child around 24 month ' correct age ( CA ) enrol study .</detailed_description>
