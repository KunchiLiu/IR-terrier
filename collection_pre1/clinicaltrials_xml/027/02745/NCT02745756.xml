	<brief_summary>This study add experimental treatment another type cell , call dendritic cell . It hop cell may stimulate immune system react neuroblastoma much way vaccine cause immune system react certain virus bacteria . The physician conduct study observe previous research neuroblastoma cell recognize immune system , destroy immune cells.The main goal study see give participant additional anti-Neuroblastoma vaccine reduces risk relapse follow Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant .</brief_summary>
