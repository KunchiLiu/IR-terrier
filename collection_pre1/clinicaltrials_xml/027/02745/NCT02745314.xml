	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND.- The frailty syndrome ( FS ) associate increase morbidity mortality elderly patient . When severe symptomatic , aortic stenosis ( AS ) disease poor prognosis , frequent cause heart surgery elderly associate high health cost . No variable identify determinant morbidity mortality patient algorithms developed treatment decision-making particular population . The FS functional reserve indicator could prognostic interventional treatment tolerance marker , include selection patient surgical treatment . The FS cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) share biological substrate among inflammatory state associate poor prognosis . OBJECTIVES .- To evaluate effectiveness diagnosis FS characterize prognosis elderly patient severe symptomatic AS representative clinical practice . In addition , examine contribution inflammatory state relationship FS prognosis severe , symptomatic AS . METHODS .- Prospective study 12 month 200 patient &gt; 74 year old severe symptomatic AS . During index visit main clinical characteristic record addition perform comprehensive geriatric assessment , FS assessmet accord Fried et al criterion ( strength , walk speed , physical activity , fatigue , unintentional weight loss ) determination inflammatory marker ( C-reactive protein interleukin-6 ) . During follow-up , measure functional impairment ( basic instrumental activity daily live , walk speed time set &amp; go test ) , hospitalization , death quality life determine .</brief_summary>
