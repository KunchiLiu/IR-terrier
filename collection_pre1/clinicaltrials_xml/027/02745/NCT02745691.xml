	<brief_summary>The aim Phase 4 study test scale structure , reliability , responsiveness change validity EORTC QLQ-LC29 conjunction EORTC QLQ-C30 patient diagnose lung cancer . Participants enrol three group accord primary therapy ( A . Surgery , B. Radiochemotherapy , C. Targeted therapy ) . Various combination therapy permissible , result total eight subgroup ( A.1 Surgery alone and/or adjuvant therapy , A.2 Surgery [ late effect ] , B.1 Chemotherapy alone , B.2 Radiotherapy alone , B.3 Sequential radiochemotherapy , B.4 Concurrent radiochemotherapy , C.1 Targeted therapy alone , C.2 Targeted therapy combination therapy ) . According sample size calculation include total N = 400 patient . N = 120 patient ask fill questionnaire second time point , subgroup n = 60 subject test-retest analysis ( patient clinically stable indicate change anchor question two assessment point ) , another n = 60 subject test-retest analysis ( indicate change worse better ) . Standard psychometric analysis employ evaluate hypothesize scale structure QLQ-LC29 internal consistency , convergent discriminate validity , well test-retest reliability responsiveness change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 4 Field Study Analyzing Psychometric Properties EORTC Quality Life Questionnaire ( QLQ ) LC29</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 comprise 30 item group five functional scale ( physical , role , cognitive , emotional social ) , one scale rate global health quality life , three multi-item symptom scale ( fatigue , nausea vomiting , pain ) five single symptom item ( dyspnoea , insomnia , appetite loss , constipation diarrhea ) , one item assess perceive financial impact disease treatment [ 18 ] . Patients rate item use four-point Likert response scale exception scale global health quality life accompany seven-point response format . A time period specify physical functioning scale item . The time frame remain item past week . The updated lung cancer module , QLQ-LC29 , module use conjunction QLQ-C30 assessment quality life patient lung cancer . All item accompany classic EORTC four-point Likert response scale label 1 `` '' , 2 `` little '' , 3 `` quite bit '' , 4 `` much '' . The time frame entire module past week ( `` Please indicate extent experienced symptom problem past week '' ) . A content analysis item preliminary psychometric calculation ( Cronbach 's alpha ) Phase 3 data suggest QLQ-LC29 compose five multi-item scale five single item . Inclusion Criteria - histologically confirm diagnosis lung cancer - previous primary recurrent tumour - ability understand language questionnaire - mental fitness complete questionnaire - 18 year age - write informed consent . Exclusion Criteria Inversely , exclusion criterion negation specify characteristic , i.e. , histologically confirm diagnosis lung cancer , previous primary recurrent tumour , mentally fit complete questionnaire , able understand language questionnaire , young 18 , refusal inform consent . Sampling matrix Participants enrol three group accord primary therapy ( A . Surgery , B. Radiochemotherapy , C. Targeted therapy ) . Various combination therapy permissible , result total eight subgroup ( A.1 Surgery alone and/or adjuvant therapy , A.2 Surgery [ late effect ] , B.1 Chemotherapy alone , B.2 Radiotherapy alone , B.3 Sequential radiochemotherapy , B.4 Concurrent radiochemotherapy , C.1 Targeted therapy alone , C.2 Targeted therapy combination therapy ) . Sample size According sample size calculation include total N = 400 patient . N = 120 patient ask fill questionnaire second time point , subgroup n = 60 subject test-retest analysis ( patient clinically stable indicate change anchor question two assessment point ) , another n = 60 subject test-retest analysis ( indicate change worse better ) . Statistical analysis Standard psychometric analysis employ evaluate hypothesize scale structure QLQ-LC29 internal consistency , convergent discriminate validity , well test-retest reliability responsiveness change .</detailed_description>
