	<brief_summary>This pilot study purpose measure vascular function , assess evaluate arterial stiffness ( pulse wave velocity augmentation index ) endothelial function ( flow mediate dilatation ) , elite/amateur symptomatic male cyclist unilateral Endofibrosis ( EF ) , compare asymptomatic male cyclist group age match healthy male ( non-athletes ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Case Control Study Vascular Function Cyclists</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endofibrosis ( EF ) iliac artery non-atheromatous flow-limiting condition specific highly trained athlete . Although pathophysiology well understood , haemodynamic injury mechanical stress consider play key role develop EF . Recurrent exposure factor could trigger arterial remodelling process result intravascular lesion EF resemble `` adaptive intimal thickening '' . Although natural history condition know , believe progressive increase number report limb threaten ischaemia due dissection and/or thrombosis arterial lumen . Therefore , imperative understand pathophysiological mechanism behind condition order develop accurate diagnostic screening criteria/tools early identification characterization EF . As data literature support hypothesis , investigator design pilot study evaluate hypothesis whether athlete EF evidence vascular dysfunction artery . There currently data whether athlete develop EF underlie arterial disease abnormality . It quite possible people develop EF underlie systemic endothelial dysfunction may represent risk factor development disease . Therefore investigator study non-invasively endothelial function ( measure flow mediate dilatation ) well arterial stiffness ( measure pulse wave velocity augmentation index ) improve understand structural mechanical characteristic vascular tree cohort patient .</detailed_description>
