	<brief_summary>At least 40 % patient prostate cancer ( PC ) present positive lymph node ( N1 ) . The optimal treatment strategy patient remain controversial . Although androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) still often initiated treatment , result disappoint . Recent study support use aggressive therapy include external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) ADT . The retrospective study support additional use EBRT N1 PC patient however conclusive regard extent radiation field . Even EPLND , might role pelvic EBRT irradicating microscopic disease . However pelvic irradiation irrevocably result increase toxicity . Moreover , node negative ( N0 ) PC patient addition pelvic EBRT result improved outcome randomise trial . However set Tumor Node Metastasis pathological stage ( p ) N1 , proven pathological examination , PC patient never evaluate far . This trial aim answer question whether pelvic EBRT beneficial pathological N1 PC patient . It also important realise pathological N1 PC patient similar outcome . There significant impact number positive lymph node outcome , two positive node suggest significant cut-off value predict survival pathological N1 PC patient . By stratify patient accord number lymph node involve study add proper selection patient benefit pelvic EBRT avoid toxicity patient benefit pelvic EBRT . Additionally , small RNAs constitute potentially valuable marker diagnosis , prognosis , therapeutic choice PC patient . Blood sample collect examine potential role miRNAs biomarker develop prognostic signature clinical relapse-free survival . The result trial serve base developping new trial order optimise treatment patient pathological N1 PC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Impact Prostate Only Versus Pelvic Radiation N+ Prostate Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In era increase evidence favour aggressive local treatment , extend pelvic lymph node dissection ( EPLND ) frequently perform data support potential role external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) pelvic node positive ( N1 ) prostate cancer ( PC ) , treatment N1 PC patient need revise . Seen lack clear guideline regard extent radiation field N1 prostate cancer patient , urgent need study evaluate place pelvic EBRT . The aim trial thus evaluate pelvic irradiation impact clinical relapse free survival pathological N1 PC . The hypothesis perform pelvic EBRT EPLND pathological N1 PC patient result significant improved clinical relapse free survival 15 % compare prostate EBRT . This evaluate multicentre Phase III stratify randomise trial randomise patient PC 1-4 positive lymph node EPLND prostate ( bed ) radiotherapy + 2 year ADT pelvic radiotherapy + 2 year androgen deprivation . A total 330 patient enrolled trial . Stratification base number positive lymph node since patient increase number positive lymph node exhibit poor prognosis .</detailed_description>
