As oncological pathology , stage disease diagnosis major determine factor estimate survival . Ovarian stimulation fertility preservation perform study , patient stage I-II ( TNM ) neoplasia treat ( surgical removal tumor ) prior systemic therapy , indicate . Among young woman great incidence basal type tumor HER2 ( human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ) , always express hormone receptor . In early stage disease , control ovarian stimulation procedure , removal tumor , reveal worsen prognosis disease , term overall survival disease-free survival ( absence local distant recurrence ) .
