	<detailed_description>The central role brain regulate food intake steer feed behaviour increasingly recognize . It currently well accept brain target organ measure effect pleasantness energy homeostasis order change feed behaviour reduce rise prevalence obesity . The effect food brain multiple complex . In addition primary aspect food taste , texture , look smell , secondary aspect energy regulation much important entire `` eat experience '' . Resting state functional connectivity brain assessed analysis low-frequency fluctuation present blood-oxygenation-level-dependent ( BOLD ) signal functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Investigators use rest state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rsfMRl ) detect change connectivity default mode salience network consumption four different milkshake add sugars sweetener .</detailed_description>
