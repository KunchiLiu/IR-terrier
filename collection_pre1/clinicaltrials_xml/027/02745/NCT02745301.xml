	<brief_summary>To assess persistence bladder cancer-specific biomarkers urine collect pre-operatively , resect cancer tissue , urine collect post-operatively . A panel sensitive specific bladder cancer biomarkers use establish signature disease pre-operative patient positive diagnosis bladder cancer current standard care ( e.g. , in-office cystoscopy , OR cystoscopy ) . The specificity marker assess , well degree non-specific signal attributable source biomolecules , analyze resect tumor tissue biomarkers . Finally , post-operative urine assess presence marker . To extent biomarker panel determine specific sensitive , may serve indicator degree surgical intervention successfully eradicate underlying disease . The investigator also aim assess stability biomarker signature urine evaluate several patient specimen various time point throughout day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current standard care non-muscle invasive bladder cancer ( NMIBC ) rely pathologic confirmation negative margin well repeat transurethral resection . National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) American Urological Association ( AUA ) guideline specify regular schedule continue examination cystoscopy cytology monitor patient recurrence disease . Physicians Choice Laboratory Services ( PCLS ) validate panel biomarkers isolate voided urine combine ability reliably detect presence transform cell population . These marker include somatic mutation number oncogene well establish important etiologic factor development bladder cancer scientific clinical literature . In addition , regional hypermethylation genome evaluate , presence absence specific proteins involved disease state . Through measurement biomarkers use next generation sequence immunoassay , PCLS able establish analytical clinical validity marker diagnose disease . The statistical correlation biomarkers presence transitional cell carcinoma result ability define distinct disease signature indicative disease preliminary study . The current study aim expand upon finding effort offer physicians additional tool manage bladder cancer . Hypothesis : Bladder cancer biomarkers elevate preoperative intraoperative urine specimen direct correlation intact lesion ( ) , diminish significantly disappear urine specimen post-operatively function completion resection . Further , persistence disease-specific biomarkers urine post-operatively may correlate risk recurrence progression . Biomarker level determine pre- , intra- post-operative urine specimen , well resect bladder tissue statistically compare change correlate presence absence visible disease . Biomarkers tissue sample quantify compare urine sample value . The specific aim current proposal : SA1 ) : Assess stability biomarker signature urine . To date , effort across biomarker field rely detection cancer context single patient specimen collect single point time . The consistency biomarker signature across specimen provide patient fully describe . The current study ass consistency biomarkers compose panel detect across urine specimen collect multiple point time subset patient . This data inform utility single point-in-time collection regard accurately define disease signature . SA2 ) : Assess persistence bladder cancer-specific biomarkers urine collect pre-operatively , resect cancer tissue , urine collect post-operatively . A panel sensitive specific bladder cancer biomarkers use establish signature disease pre-operative patient positive diagnosis bladder cancer current standard care ( e.g. , in-office cystoscopy ) . The specificity marker assess , well degree non-specific signal attributable source biomolecules , analyze resect tumor tissue biomarkers . Finally , post-operative urine assess presence marker . To extent biomarker panel determine specific sensitive , may serve indicator degree surgical intervention successfully eradicate underlying disease . SA3 ) : Determine whether persistence biomarkers patient urine post-operatively correlate recurrence progression . The panel marker detect pre-operative urine tumor assay voided urine collect routine follow-up surveillance visit period one year . Biomarkers monitor persistence quantitative change level .</detailed_description>
