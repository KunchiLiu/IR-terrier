	<brief_summary>In feasibility study , [ 18F ] dabrafenib use radioactive tracer . All patient study diagnose advanced melanoma evidence brain metastasis eligible treatment dabrafenib , specific V600-mutated BRAF inhibitor . Patients undergo dynamic PET scan brain determine [ 18F ] dabrafenib distribution kinetics brain metastasis . In addition , static total body PET scan perform visualize whole body distribution tracer uptake .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : Dabrafenib oral protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor specifically target mutate BRAF protein . It use treatment metastatic melanoma evidence BRAF V600 mutation genomic material . However , group patient often heterogenic response treatment see . Heterogeneity drug accumulation tumor could responsible observed difference treatment response lesion patient . Besides poor tumor accumulation drug , heterogeneous expression drug target , B-Raf protein , patient lesion within single patient could account heterogeneity treatment response . PET image radioactively label carrier-added [ 18F ] dabrafenib ( low specific activity ) tracer might useful tool show distribution pattern kinetics native drug ; particular PET use determine dabrafenib cross blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) accumulate brain metastasis . Since behavior [ 18F ] dabrafenib patient hitherto unknown , first feasibility study need . In feasibility study , use low specific activity [ 18F ] dabrafenib , label procedure already develop , determine whole body distribution kinetics brain metastasis metastatic BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma patient . Study design : This study feasibility study use [ 18F ] dabrafenib PET tracer , 10 patient . Patients eligible study least 18 year age . They diagnose metastatic melanoma presence metastasis brain positive BRAF V600 mutation status . In addition , patient naïve treatment BRAF MEK inhibitor . Interventions : A [ 18F ] dabrafenib PET/CT scan MRI scan brain perform baseline , 7 day less start treatment oral dabrafenib . CT MRI part regular care . The PET procedure commence injection approximately 200 MBq [ 18F ] dabrafenib , follow 60 minute dynamic PET scan brain thereafter total-body PET scan ( toe head ) . During dynamic PET scan brain , arterial blood sample analysis plasma metabolite perform . Treatment response monitor part regular treatment ( CT thorax/abdomen MRI brain ) 4 week . In addition , single venous blood sample collect isolation circulate tumor DNA . Immunohistochemical stain mutate B-raf protein perform tumor tissue , either derive fresh biopsy preexist tumor specimen . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Patients participate study receive dynamic PET/CT scan brain , static total-body PET/CT scan MRI scan brain baseline . After 4 week receive CT scan chest abdomen MRI scan brain . All CT MRI scan part regular care . The PET/CT scan , study procedure , carry radiation burden 4.1 mSv . This constitute intermediate risk , base criterion International Commission Radiological Protection . For purpose pharmacokinetic modeling , arterial catheter place invasive procedure . Expected adverse event identical unlabeled dabrafenib . Patients directly benefit study , participation help get insight pharmacokinetics dabrafenib role treatment brain metastasis .</detailed_description>
