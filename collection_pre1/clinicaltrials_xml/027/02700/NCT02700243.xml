	<brief_title>Increase Tolerance Exercise Raise Activity Through Connectedness Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study evaluate whether use Fitbit device exercise prescription associate increased daily activity turn increase exercise tolerance young adult patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . The investigator hypothesize use Fitbit exercise prescription associate increase exercise tolerance compare standard counseling exercise prescription alone . For patient CF , young adulthood adolescence significant time vulnerability . In addition normal behavioral challenge adolescence young adulthood ( seek independence/autonomy also choose rebellion ) , CF often deal significant disease progression . Therefore , work new innovative way improve adherence regimen improve lung function exercise need continue support patient vulnerable time . Studies patient cystic fibrosis show regular exercise training decrease rate lung function decline , potentially improve lung function , improve aerobic capacity . However , many patient include regular exercise daily routine . Successful strategy improve adherence include provide patient specific guideline appropriate exercise program , support participation provide positive feedback . Overall , exercise crucial diagnostic therapeutic modality patient Cystic Fibrosis , although awareness somewhat limit . The adult CF program Boston Children 's Brigham &amp; Women 's Hospital establish inpatient outpatient exercise program part quality improvement effort . Patients prescribed individualized exercise program exercise prescription base assessment sub-maximal effort . This program successful give rigor daily life ( e.g . school , work , family obligation ) , adherence concern resource limit rigorous feedback maintain essential life activity .</detailed_description>
