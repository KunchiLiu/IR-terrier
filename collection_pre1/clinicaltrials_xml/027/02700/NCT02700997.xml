	<brief_title>Uterosacral Ligament Suspension Clip</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterosacral ligament suspension Is commonly performed procedure support vaginal apex time pelvic reconstructive surgery pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) . Despite well establish durable option patient , little research detail ligament suspension suture location live model . The available literature limit cadaveric study , suggest suture placement close proximity vital structure ureter , blood vessel , rectum nerve . This study seek describe suture location relation surround anatomy postoperative patient follow high uterosacral ligament suspension . The secondary aim determine safe zone suture placement . Seventeen woman ( age 18-85 ) care Cincinnati Urogynecology Associates , physician group TriHealth , choose vaginal hysterectomy uterosacral ligament suspension ( USLS ) treatment choice pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) enrol . At time surgery , titanium vascular clip ( size small ) applied base delay absorbable suture place vaginal apex internal vaginal side help identification image . On postoperative day ( POD ) 1 , patient undergo CT pelvis scan . The CT scan involve administration IV contrast image ureter vascular structure . The clip fall suture dissolve 12 week postoperatively . All patient ask complete low extremity neurological questionnaire preoperatively postoperatively .</detailed_description>
