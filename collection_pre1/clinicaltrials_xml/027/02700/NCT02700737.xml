	<brief_summary>To answer research question : `` Would image-based model result different clinical decision compare clinical practice guideline ? `` , conduct randomize controlled experiment compare hypothetical decision make interventional cardiologist present image parameter currently recommend clinical practice guideline vs. hypothetical decision make interventional cardiologist receive expanded list parameter , include simulation modelling .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Image-Based Modelling Clinical Decisions Coarctation Aorta</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In collaboration three clinical partner , first generate two separate image datasets maximum three patient recruit participate CARDIOPROOF . The first dataset include image parameter currently recommend clinical practice guideline ( refer `` limited dataset '' ) . The second dataset include expand list parameter , inclusive information available traditional imaging parameter ( recommend guideline ) simulation modeling ( refer `` image-based modelling dataset '' ) . We generate limited image-based model datasets fully de-identified patient already enrol CARDIOPROOF ( NCT02591940 ) consent publication data anonymized form . Using computerized random-sample function , randomly allocate interventional cardiologist two separate group present one set imaging data . The first group receive `` limited '' dataset include information available traditional diagnostics ( recommended clinical practice guideline ) pre-specified number patient ( maximum 3 ) . The second group receive full , detailed dataset inclusive information available traditional diagnostics ( recommend guideline ) simulation model set patient . We ask interventional cardiologist two group make ( hypothetical ) clinical decision use dataset image parameter present . The clinical decision hypothetical patient treat accord clinical practice guideline experiment retrospectively involve interventional cardiologist directly involve care patient participate CARDIOPROOF . The analysis focus hypothetical scenario compare proportion cardiologists make different type intervention decision two randomly allocate group .</detailed_description>
