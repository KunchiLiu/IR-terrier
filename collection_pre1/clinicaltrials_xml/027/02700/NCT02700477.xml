	<brief_summary>Trigonella Foenum-Graecum , commonly know Fenugreek , plant extensively use source anti-diabetic compound Fenugreek traditionally use India , especially Ayurvedic Unani system . Preliminary animal human trial suggest possible hypoglycemic anti-hyper lipidemic property Fenugreek seed powder , take orally . Fenugreek seed contain 50 % fiber ( 30 % soluble fiber 20 % insoluble fiber ) slow rate post-prandial glucose absorption . This may secondary mechanism hypoglycemic effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus complex heterogeneous group metabolic condition characterize increased level blood glucose due impairment insulin action and/or insulin secretion . Diabetes condition primarily define level hyperglycemia give rise risk microvascular damage ( retinopathy , nephropathy neuropathy ) . It associate reduced life expectancy , significant morbidity due specific diabetes related Microvascular complication , increase risk macrovascular complication ( ischemic heart disease , stroke peripheral vascular disease ) , diminish quality life.Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) common form diabetes human result combination genetic acquire factor impair -cell function tissue insulin sensitivity . The WHO put number person diabetes worldwide approximately 170 million . The prevalence diabetes mellitus rise dramatically past 20 year , number people diabetes expect reach 366 million 2025 . The prevalence type 2 diabetes mellitus expect grow even rapidly future . There also considerable geographic variation incidence T2DM , country like India fast emerge `` diabetes hot spot '' . About 5-10 % total health care budget use T2DM many country . Reduced pancreatic β-cell functional mass diabetes , category glucose intolerance , describe several author , decrease islet and/or -cell volume pancreas type 2 diabetic patient consistently report . In addition , study conduct patient , isolated islet , show quantitative qualitative defect glucose-stimulated insulin secretion . The ideal antidiabetic agent normalize plasma glucose , minimize side effect , prevent development micro- macrovascular complication . Obviously agent available , likely available near medium-term future . Current treatment treatment regimen include combination oral antidiabetic drug ( OADs ) , antihypertensive medication , antidyslipidemic agent , less successful manage respective disease target clinical goal . Measures screen intensive life-style modification help delay onset diabetes at-risk individual , stringent glycemic control pharmacotherapy may improve outcome . To manage type 2 diabetes epidemic effectively , however , agent effectively durably control glycemia provide pleiotropic benefit ( e.g . blood pressure reduction ) require . The landmark Diabetes Control Complications Trial United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) convincingly demonstrate normalize glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1C ) level individual diabetes reduce diabetes-related cardio-vascular ( CV ) morbidity mortality well incidence progression micro vascular complication . HbA1C concentration accurate predictor risk complication , desirable goal 7.0 % less . In clinical setting , measurement HbA1C assess longer-term glycemic control among individual diabetes . A range therapeutic agent exist treatment type 2 diabetes . Metformin , biguanide , commonly prescribed oral anti diabetic drug ; American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) /European Association Study Diabetes ( EASD ) guideline recommend metformin initial pharmacotherapy type 2 diabetes , expect reduction HbA1C 1.0 % 2.0 % . In recommendation , ADA International Diabetes Foundation support metformin initial pharmacotherapy type 2 diabetes . However , Metformin associate increase CV risk lactic acidosis , contraindicate patient heart failure impair renal function . Metformin monotherapy also associate diarrhea approximately 50 % patient nausea vomit 25 % patient . Sulfonylurea 's ( SUs ) e.g. , glimepiride long effective low-cost mainstay type 2 diabetes therapy ; metformin , SU monotherapy expect reduce HbA1C 1.0 % 2.0 % . SUs common alternative add-on metformin act stimulate pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion glucose-independent manner . Weight gain common adverse effect SU therapy , increase risk hypoglycemia , particularly elderly patient worsen renal function . Thiazolidinedione ( TZD ) monotherapy associate HbA1C reduction 0.5 % 1.4 % . TZDs beneficial effect CV marker , include lipid level ( particularly triglyceride HDL-Cholesterol ) , blood pressure , inflammatory mediator , endothelial function , fibrinolytic status . However , weight gain increase risk edema heart failure frequent adverse effect , particularly TZDs use combination insulin . Alpha-glucosidase inhibitor , acarbose , act competitive inhibitor alpha glucosidases , thereby delay glucose absorption . This effect glucose uptake decrease glucose peak insulin response postprandially moderately lower fast plasma glucose level HbA1C , gastrointestinal adverse effect requirement three time daily dosing may inhibit adherence therapy . Monotherapy alpha-glucosidase inhibitor associate HbA1C reduction 0.5 % 0.8 % , weight gain . Glinide ( i.e. , repaglinide , nateglinide ) monotherapy report reduce HbA1C 0.5 % 1.5 % . The rapid onset action glinides necessitate three time daily dosing , associate hypoglycemia . Weight gain report glinide therapy ( 0.7 1.8 kg ) . Insulin , either alone combination agent , commonly metformin , effective option restore normoglycemia , especially administer early disease course . The disadvantage insulin therapy weight gain increase risk hypoglycemia . Insulin observe clinically relevant effect either blood pressure lipid . In addition devise appropriate pharmacotherapeutic regimen patient type 2 diabetes , patient management also critical importance best handle medical care team include physician , pharmacist , dietitian , diabetes education specialist . Ideally , diabetes care plan develop input medical care team practitioner patient . Incretin-based therapy , include glucagon-like peptide ( GLP ) -1 receptor agonist 's exenatide exenatide Long act release ( LAR ) , liraglutide Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) inhibitor sitagliptin , vildagliptin , saxagliptin represent new class antidiabetic drug . Data suggest equal potentially great efficacy incretin-based therapy low HbA1C compare antidiabetic therapy , low risk hypoglycemia . Other benefit include weight reduction ( GLP-1 receptor agonist ) weight neutrality ( DPP-4 inhibitor ) .GLP-1 receptor agonist recently add ADA/EASD treatment algorithm tier 2 alternative addition SUs basal insulin patient adequately control metformin plus lifestyle modification . The OADs able , time , reduce A1C correct metabolic glucoregulatory dysfunction involve type 2 diabetes pathophysiology . As result , HbA1C goals become difficult maintain significant glycemic burden accumulates , increase risk CV diseases . The treatment co morbid condition , particularly hypertension , may also impede achieve maintain glycemic goal . Difficulties maintain long-term glycemic control currently available antidiabetic therapy lead need additional treatment use monotherapy combine safely exist agent may target underlie pathology type 2 diabetes . Although traditional treatment treatment combination initially successful lower HbA1C , unable restore normoglycemia long term . Recent data suggest mean time secondary failure OADs ( therapeutic event necessitate addition another agent insulin ) may short 1.3 year . The primary goal treatment patient type 2 diabetes maintenance beta-cell function , decline major reason impairment glucose tolerance time . Consequently , therapy arrest progressive beta-cell deterioration restore maintain normoglycemia require . New therapy need also minimize weight gain correct dyslipidemia without compromise improvement glycemic control . The Investigational Agent Trigonella Foenum Graecum , commonly know Fenugreek , plant extensively use source antidiabetic compound , seed , leave extract different model system . Fenugreek traditionally use India , especially Ayurvedic Unani systems.Preliminary animal human trial suggest possible hypoglycemic anti-hyperlipidemic property fenugreek seed powder take orally . Fenugreek seed contain 50 % fiber ( 30 % soluble fiber 20 % insoluble fiber ) slow rate post-prandial glucose absorption . This may secondary mechanism hypoglycemic effect .</detailed_description>
