	<brief_title>Biofeedback Wheelchair Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants study ask participate follow first ( 1st ) session : 1 . Physical exam assess joint motion 2 . Questionnaires ask shoulder pain 3 . All subset following activity : 1 . Level wheelchair propulsion 10 minute 2 . Ramp wheelchair propulsion 3 . Lifting wheelchair , include car ( simulated car therapy area ) 4 . Transferring in/out wheelchair 5 . Overhead task ( lift object shelf ) 6 . Reaching During next session ( ) , participant ask participate subset activity list ( 3a-3f ) also guide biofeedback intervention . The intervention consist visual and/or auditory cue guide movement performing task . The visual biofeedback consist line shape target screen participant 's goal achieve movement . The auditory cue tone multiple tone alert participant move and/or target achieve . During biofeedback session study staff may also provide verbal cue feedback . The investigator may review medical record participant obtain information spinal cord injury , wheelchair injury muscle , ligament , bone nerve . During session , prior perform activity list ( 3a-3f ) , motion sensor apply skin overlie participant 's sternum ( chest ) , shoulder blade , via plastic cuff arm elbow , wrist use medical grade adhesive tape . Sensors detect muscle activity may also apply skin participant 's arm . Sensors detect force apply participant 's arm also use . Force detect use subset following tool : exchange one wheel participant 's wheelchair one size detect force , participant wear glove detect force , use mat detects force . The activity complete study may photograph videotaped .</detailed_description>
