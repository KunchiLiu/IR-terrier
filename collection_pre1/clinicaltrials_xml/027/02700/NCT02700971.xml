	<brief_summary>This trial utilize Molecular MicroscopeTM diagnostic system ( MMDxTM ) combine molecular histopathological feature biopsy , plus clinical laboratory parameter , create first Integrated Diagnostic System . This MMDxTM utilized phenotype cutaneous melanoma biopsy sample detect immune responsive mRNA signature .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microarray Prediction Response Nivolumab , Ipilimumab , Combined Therapy Subjects With Previously Untreated , Locally Advanced Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial treatment consist pretreatment 18 gauge core biopsy locally advance metastatic cutaneous subcutaneous lesion . The biopsy stabilize site RNAlater ship ATAGC courier ambient temperature . RNA extract use Trizol-chloroform method purify use RNAEasy micro kit ( Qiagen ) . RNA sample pass quality control test ( Agilent Bioanalyzer ) label , hybridize PrimeView Affymetrix microarrays scan accord manufacturer 's protocol . Resulting `` .CEL '' file use analysis global gene expression . Pathogenesis Based Transcript ( PBT ) set represent molecular signature inflammation assess core biopsy melanoma patient . Each PBT set get `` score '' - summarize expression member set . PBT score allow estimate pre post-treatment immunological activity tumor e.g . TCMR activity macrophage burden . PBT score correlate clinical outcome determine utility technology prognostic predictive biomarker . Finally molecular classifier predict response therapy build .</detailed_description>
