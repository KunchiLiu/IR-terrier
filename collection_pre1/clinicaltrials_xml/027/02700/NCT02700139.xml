	<brief_summary>The aim clinical trial compare rate myopic progression child wear aspheric ( MyLens ) spherical/ toric ophthalmic lens . The propose lens design aspheric lens suppose slow myopic progression child unique asphericity ( proprietary information ) . Myopic progression quantify change axial length ( AL ) cycloplegic refractive error ( Rx ) monitor 6-12 month ( 6 month crossover ) double-masking . Peripheral refraction ocular aberration evaluate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Visual manipulation induce progressive addition lens ( PALs ) show inhibit eye growth myopia development child 11 % 21 % efficacy compare single vision lens . However , treatment effect PALs statistically significant clinically insufficient . The current study aim investigate use spectacle lenses unique novel design myopia control child . This prospective one-year randomize clinical study evaluate axial elongation myopia progression eye use novel lens design compare use conventional single-vision design . It double-masked , cross-over study . One eye fit study lens eye fit single-vision lens . Subjects ask wear spectacle 6 month two lens design swap next 6 month wash-out period 2 week . Both subject examiner aware lens design use subject phase .</detailed_description>
