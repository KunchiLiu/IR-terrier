	<brief_summary>This phase I/Ib study design establish safety maximum tolerate dose ( MTD , also recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) ) aurora kinase A inhibitor alisertib combine dose-adjusted ( DA ) -R-EPOCH ( rituximab , etoposide , doxorubicin , vincristine , cyclophosphamide prednisone ) patient CD20-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , transform follicular lymphoma Burkitt lymphoma positive Myc gene rearrangement ( Myc+ ) . Filgrastim peg-filgrastim also include cycle R-EPOCH . Once identify MTD , expansion cohort limit Myc+ DLBCL population open characterize clinical activity safety . Secondary objective include estimate complete response rate ( CR ) progression free survival ( PFS ) . We also explore association baseline kinome signature and/or RNA sequence CR , identify differential kinome transcriptome prior treatment .</brief_summary>

Patients may enroll study base local laboratory evaluation , confirm UNC Hematopathology Laboratory retrospectively Positive CD20 via immunophenotyping Prior Treatment : Previously untreated received maximum one cycle combination chemotherapy ( i.e . RCHOP , REPOCH , RhyperCVAD ) within 4 week study entry except patient require dose reduction first cycle offstudy REPOCH . Measurable disease assess 2 dimensional measurement CT ( ≥ 1.5 cm ) . Adequate organ function demonstrate : Bone marrow function ( without platelet transfusion myeloid growth factor support within two week screen ) demonstrate : Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,000 cells/mm3 Platelet count ≥75,000/mm3 And hepatic renal function demonstrate : Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; ALT AST 5 x ULN liver metastases present Total serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN CrCl ≥ 30 Adequate renal function define : Calculated creatinine clearance must ≥ 30 mL/minute base CockcroftGault formula Documented negative serologic test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B ( unless serologically positive due prior vaccination ) , hepatitis C within year prior enrollment ( note : guidance define active infection hepatitis B , please refer WHO guideline . ( World Health Organization , Global Alert Response ( GAR ) , Hepatitis B ( who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/ whocdscsrlyo20022/en/index4.html ) Patient agree consume 1 standard unit alcohol per day study 30 day last dose alisertib . A standard unit alcohol define 12 oz beer ( 350 mL ) , 1.5 oz ( 45 mL ) 80proof alcohol , one 6oz ( 175 mL ) glass wine . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative pregnancy test within 7 day prior D1 treatment Female subject must : Postmenopausal least one year screen visit , Surgically sterilize , Willing use acceptable method birth control ( ie , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide , abstinence ) duration study . Male subject , even surgically sterilize ( ie , status postvasectomy ) , agree : Use acceptable method contraception ( effective barrier contraception : Completely abstain heterosexual intercourse ) entire study treatment period 4 month last dose alisertib . Ability swallow oral medication As determined enrol physician protocol designee , ability patient understand comply study procedure entire length study Sufficient data calculate International Prognostic Index ( IPI ) score baseline : Age Stage Disease LDH ECOG performance status number extranodal sit Voluntary write informed consent performance studyrelated procedure part normal medical care , understand consent may withdraw subject time without prejudice future medical care . Adequate leave ventricular function ejection fraction ≥ 40 % echocardiogram MUGA scan . Exclusion Criteria CNS involvement DLBCL Major surgery within 4 week prior entry Receiving concurrent cytotoxic , biologic agent ( ) investigational agent ; NOTE : Concurrent intrathecal chemotherapy CNS prophylaxis allow per institutional standard Receipt investigational drug within 14 day D1 alisertib Prior administration Aurora A kinasetargeted agent , include alisertib Patients `` currently active '' second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer , noninvasive bladder cancer , `` low risk '' adenocarcinoma prostate carcinoma situ cervix . Patients consider `` currently active '' malignancy complete therapy free disease ≥ 3 year . Treatment clinically significant enzyme inducer , enzymeinducing antiepileptic drug phenytoin , carbamazepine phenobarbital , rifampin , rifabutin , rifapentine St. John 's wort within 14 day prior first dose alisertib study . Radiation therapy 25 % bone marrow ( note : whole pelvic radiation consider 25 % ) Prior allogeneic bone marrow organ transplantation Known GI disease GI procedure could interfere oral absorption tolerance alisertib ; example include , limited partial gastrectomy , history small intestine surgery , celiac disease Known history uncontrolled sleep apnea syndrome condition could result excessive daytime sleepiness , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ; requirement supplemental oxygen Requirement constant administration proton pump inhibitor 5 day prior D1 alisertib , and/or requirement constant administration H2 antagonist , pancreatic enzyme ; intermittent us antacid H2 antagonists allow Requirement drug , juice and/or herbs strongly inhibit CYP3A4 within 7 day prior D1 alisertib throughout treatment NOTE : Glucocorticoids consider inducer CYP3A4 . However , use allow patient take continuous dose 15 mg/day prednisone ( equivalent ) least 1 month prior D1 alisertib . In addition , low dose steroid use control nausea vomit allow . Topical steroid use inhale steroid also permit . Systemic infection require IV antibiotic therapy within 14 day precede first dose study drug , severe infection Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Prior study entry , ECG abnormality Screening document investigator medically relevant . Female subject pregnant breastfeeding ; confirmation subject pregnant must establish negative serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ( betahCG ) pregnancy test result obtain screening ( within 7 day prior D1 treatment ) . Pregnancy test require postmenopausal surgically sterilize woman . Serious medical psychiatric illness likely interfere participation clinical study Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , include uncontrolled diabetes , malabsorption , resection pancreas upper small bowel , requirement pancreatic enzyme , condition would modify small bowel absorption oral medication , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate enrollment study . Inability swallow oral medication inability unwillingness comply administration requirement related alisertib .
