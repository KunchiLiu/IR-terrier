	<detailed_description>The New York City Department Health Mental Hygiene ( DOHMH ) Montefiore Medical Center , Fund Public Health New York , DOHMH 's fiscal agent , partner study evaluate feasibility , health outcome return-on-investment single integrate pest management ( IPM ) intervention Bronx , Harlem Northern Manhattan child age 5 12 persistent asthma live home pest . Principal Investigator ( PI ) Daniel Kass , MSPH , Deputy Commissioner DOHMH Division Environmental Health , extensive experience oversee evaluation program policy initiative , co-PI Marina Reznik , MD , MS , Associate Professor Pediatrics Montefiore , conduct research evaluate impact home-based asthma intervention asthma-related outcome child persistent asthma recruit Montefiore clinic . Asthma common childhood disease New York City , prevalence hospitalization rate high high-poverty neighborhood . The great individual community-level factor associate asthma disparity vary exposure trigger home , notably cockroaches mouse . Asthma health care cost significant , prevention effort reduce trigger could result improve outcome significant cost saving . Unlike traditional pest control , rely solely pesticide , IPM eliminate pest prevents re-infestation address housing condition conducive pest safe , target use pesticide . The specific goal project : - Demonstrate feasibility implement basic IPM intervention home child age 5-12 year persistent asthma current prescription controller medication past-year history asthma-related urgent care visit live household pest problem . - Evaluate change asthma outcomes asthma-related health system utilization associate IPM intervention . - Assess cost return-on-investment ( ROI ) IPM intervention . - Report finding support policy adopt insurance reimbursement basic IPM intervention embed health service delivery prevent asthma exacerbation due pest trigger home . HealthFirst Affinity , among large insurer pediatric patient Bronx , collaborate research team , provide support recruitment use data health outcome among study participant evaluation . The research team also work pest control expert establish well-priced replicable protocol IPM best practice . The protocol build upon DOHMH 's prior work evaluate IPM public housing , demonstrate significant reduction pest population allergen kitchen bedroom , sustain effect . The study aim contribute best-practice model one-time IPM service home effective reduce asthma trigger also practical readily adoptable pest control industry , replace current pesticides-only approach . This groundwork critical effort scale meet demand , IPM intervention become reimbursable service asthma care high-risk child . This two-year research project employ prospective , randomize control study design random assignment 400 participant two group : intervention control . Participants group follow 12-month period three assessment : baseline ( recruit ) , 6 month , 12 month after-recruitment . The intervention group receive IPM service within 2-4 week completion baseline assessment . In addition intervention , family provide basic information good pest-control practice , appropriate food storage , give set food storage container . The control group provide basic pest control information baseline offer equivalent intervention , information , food storage container completion 12-month assessment . The primary clinical outcome measure : asthma-related urgent care ( unscheduled ambulatory ) visit , asthma-related emergency department ( ED ) visit , asthma-related hospitalization . The evaluation propose initiative ass intervention implementation cost , impact health outcome , healthcare cost saving ROI . This project target low-income child potential significantly improve health well-being . The study design evaluate inexpensive scalable environmental intervention asthma replicate New York City neighborhood incorporate urban healthcare set New York State nationwide . By demonstrate cost effectiveness , study could provide basis health insurance coverage IPM visit embed clinical treatment plan high-risk asthma patient live pest .</detailed_description>
