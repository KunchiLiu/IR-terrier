	<brief_summary>Patients painful knee condition often present hip muscle weakness . This weakness lead , perpetuate , knee problem . Diminished strength cause movement impairment lead pathology , functional limitation disablement . In case , hip muscle weakness cause simple disuse muscle shrinkage ( atrophy ) . Hip weakness may cause inhibitory mechanism limit force output muscle . The inhibition reflexive response pain joint dysfunction . Joint mobilization/manipulation quickly reduce pain improve joint function , possibly decrease inhibition increase strength . Joint mobilization/manipulation may facilitate strength recovery . By restore strength sooner , patient may avoid deleterious effect prolong muscle weakness achieve quicker well outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Hip Versus Spinal Joint Mobilization Hip Muscle Strength</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients knee pain often present hip muscle weakness . Hip muscle weakness cause faulty hip mechanic contribute adverse knee joint kinematics . The gluteus maximus large hip muscle primary action extension external rotation hip joint . Gluteus muscle weakness associate varied knee injury , include patellofemoral pain syndrome , iliotibial band syndrome anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) sprain . In 2 systematic review assess subject anterior knee pain , author find strong evidence impair hip extensor muscle strength activation . In prospective cohort study , weak hip external rotation strength associate development anterior knee pain hip strength diminish pain start . There evidence support gluteal muscle strengthen management anterior knee pain . Some author argue gluteal muscle weakness may cause muscle inhibition simple disuse atrophy . This reflexive muscle inhibition neural-mediated driven pain joint dysfunction . Joint mobilization/manipulation reduces pain improves joint function may help maximize strength reduce inhibition . Yerys et . al . ( 2002 ) demonstrate hip joint mobilization cause immediate 14 % increase gluteus maximus strength Makofsky ( 2007 ) find immediate 17 % increase gluteus medius strength hip joint mobilization . Both study , however , use asymptomatic subject result may translate symptomatic patient . Chilibeck ( 2011 ) find immediate 14 % increase hip extension strength , 12 % hip abduction , lumbar spine thrust joint manipulation . This study also use asymptomatic sample . In addition , thrust joint manipulation use less frequently physical therapy practice compare nonthrust joint mobilization . The scientific objective research ass effect spine hip joint mobilization hip muscle strength patient knee pain . The study aim answer follow question : 1 . Does hip joint mobilization immediately improve hip muscle strength patient knee pain ? 2 . Does spinal joint mobilization immediately improve hip muscle strength patient knee pain ? 3 . Does hip spinal joint mobilization create great improvement hip muscle strength patient knee pain ? This pilot , prospective clinical trial use randomize clinical trial design . The primary dependent variable isometric muscle strength , measure pound , interval level measurement . Muscle strength determine maximum voluntary contraction ( MVC ) measure electronic hand-held dynamometer . Hand-held dynamometric muscle test demonstrate good intrarater reliability validity compare Biodex dynamometry . Although establish minimal clinically important change ( MCID ) score strength testing , author suggest 10 % change strength clinically significant . Pain measure ordinal level numeric pain rating scale ( NRPS ) . Investigators recruit subject routine clinical practice within NYULMC-CMC . The outcome variable ( isometric muscle strength strength ) measure intervention initial evaluation visit . After measure obtain , participation study complete . There follow-up .</detailed_description>
