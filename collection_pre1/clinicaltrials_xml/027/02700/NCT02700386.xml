	<brief_summary>The propose study do learn particular dose radiation treatment breast cancer complete short amount time traditionally use treat breast cancer . Subjects ask research study already surgery breast cancer cancer cell find lymph nodes drain breast tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Shorter Course Radiation Treatment Breast Cancer That Has Spread Lymph Nodes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects join study receive shorten course radiation treatment last approximately four ( 4 ) week , instead traditional six ( 6 ) week course woman typically receive situation . The short course subject receive design way think equivalent long course . This short course already show safe effective treat breast cancer breast tissue . However , cancer cell find lymph nodes drain breast , subject require radiation large area chest , armpit , shoulder completely test experimental dose .</detailed_description>
