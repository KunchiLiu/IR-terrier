	<brief_title>Effects Upper Limb Motor Robotic Training Over Neuroplasticity Function Capacity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial carry Institute Physical Medicine Rehabilitation University São Paulo since February 2012 . The investigator include patient clinical diagnosis Ischemic hemorrhagic stroke . The patient randomize block four , six eight , two arm : ICT : patient undergo 60 minute physiotherapy occupational therapy twice week ten consecutive week . Other therapeutic service phonoaudiology , psychology , nutrition , physical conditioning prescribe upon patient ' medical demand . After 10 week , patient undergo two whole week daily ICT reach 90 % time constraint , include weekend . During last period , therapeutic service offer , occupational therapy ICT . Patients allow undergo robotic therapy . Robotic therapy : patient undergo robotic occupational therapy 60 minute , three time week twelve consecutive week . All therapeutic service prescribe upon patient ' medical demand . Patients allow undergo ICT . The investigator raters blind treatment . The evaluation do prior beginning treatment end . The follow assessment do 3 12 month end treatment . The sample size estimate 62 patient arm , total size 124 patient</detailed_description>
