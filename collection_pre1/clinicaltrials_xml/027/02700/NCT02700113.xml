	<brief_title>Investigating Phenotypic Profiles Children Adolescents With ASD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 25 % 30 % child ASD fail acquire spoken language . This group child adolescents ASD neglect research conduct past 2 decade , part field lack tool ass , often pose significant behavioral challenge preclude participation research study . Among ~70 % individual ASD speak language skill , 50 % language impair ; remain group normal language score standardized test . To date , study brain cognitive mechanism underlie heterogeneity ASD remain limited . The goal study , part Autism Center Excellence , provide detailed description phenotypic profile find among minimally verbal individual diagnose ASD . Participants ASD age 4 18 give comprehensive assessment , include standardized assessment language , nonverbal cognitive ability adaptive function . Assessments also include experimental task base use eye-tracking , touch screen electrophysiology technology ( EEG ) , parent-report measure parent-child interaction measure . The eye-tracking touch screen assessment target receptive language , word learning mechanism , social attention deployment visual auditory stimulus . The EEG/ERP assessment target auditory processing organization , specific focus mismatch negativity ( MMN ) marker auditory processing . Based comprehensive assessment investigator aim generate description cognitive-behavioral phenotype common minimally verbal autistic individual . The investigator also investigate age-related pattern development behavioral phenotype role symptom severity shape phenotypic profile population . The investigator expect finding provide valuable insight etiology profound expressive language deficit significant proportion ASD population lead identify subphenotypes within minimally verbal population .</detailed_description>
