	<brief_title>Study Pulse Pressure During Tilttable Erigo® Adult Patients With Acquired Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial take place non private hospital Denmark . Patients recruit two ward treat patient severe brain injury , patient admit study period consider regard inclusion exclusion . Patients include via close relative accept , patient GP ( General Practitioner ) . Any adverse effect event report local ethic committee . All data collect simultaneously intervention . Some data directly record via monitor output , data directly inputted Epidata , trial take place . Sample size calculate 10 60 individual depend actual difference . Beyond 60 included individual clinical relevance statistical significant result longer apparent . If individual variable noncomplete , analysis subject miss data , undertaken . The statistical analysis plan follow general crossover design use approach consider 2 treatment 2 period . Patients cluster randomize cluster 4 , treat one intervention first . Intervention A : Traditional tilt table . measurement 0 degree 30 deg . 60. deg . return 0 deg . Intervention B : Erigo® tilttable , measurement intervention A . During intervention step frequency Erigo® set 48 steps/min . Between two period wash period least ½ hour maximum 2 hour plan . Primary outcome derive noninvasive BP measurement .</detailed_description>
