	<detailed_description>This study prospective , baseline blind control , one arm clinical study show performance safety UltraShape treatment non-invasive abdominal fat reduction . Up 60 Healthy subject 4 investigational site enrol study . All subject undergo assessment general health . During treatment period , subject 's fat thickness circumference measure three successive UltraShape treatment , two week interval , perform . The study subject undergo UltraShape treatment abdomen . During follow-up period visit conduct follow : 4 week ( 4wk FU ) , 8 week ( 8wk FU ) 12 week ( 12wk FU ) post last treatment ( Tx.3 ) . Subject 's abdominal fat thickness circumference measure measurement point assess visit . Additionally , subject questionnaire complete follow-up visit ( 4wk , 8wk 12wk FU ) . Finally , photography perform visible light condition front , right , leave back view . Most assessment occur visit ( treatment follow-up visit ) clinic .</detailed_description>
