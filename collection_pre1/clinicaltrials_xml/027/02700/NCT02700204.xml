	<brief_title>Histological Study Evaluate Skin Changes After PicoWay® 1064 nm 532nm Picosecond Fractional Laser Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This histological study prospective clinical study evaluate skin biopsy single PicoWay treatment 532nm 1064nm fractional hand-piece . Up 30 healthy candidate , enrol 2 participate study site . Subjects study assign Arm 1 Arm 2 , take account skin type , receive fractional treatment peri auricular and/or Buttocks accord investigator decision : Arm 1 : 532nm hand-piece Arm 2 : 1064nm hand-piece Subjects receive one treatment peri auricular and/or Buttocks , fractional hand-piece . The investigator may use multiplicity energy level area subarea single treatment , order titrate optimum energy level . Further , investigator elect , Picoway handpiece distal end ( distance gauge end ) flat piece transparent plastic/glass ( appropriate anti reflective coat desire ) , contact skin . In case , investigator may also elect use couple gel match medium skin glass . All subject biopsy treat area ( single two peri post-auricular , buttock ) baseline prior treatment . Biopsies area also perform immediately treatment ( within 30 minute ) and/or ~48 hour treatment , accord physician discretion , 2-month follow-up . Topical anesthetic ( ointment ) intradermal inject solution may use prior treatment</detailed_description>
