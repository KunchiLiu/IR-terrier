	<brief_summary>The main goal study find people Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) develop verbal ability remain minimally-verbal throughout adolescence adulthood . Current research focus investigate brain difference related process sound initiate speech adolescent young adult ASD vary language skill , compare adolescent ASD , order clarify whether atypical process auditory perception , perceptual organization and/or neural oscillation pattern may explain individual ASD fail acquire functional speech .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>About 30 % child Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) fail acquire spoken language . This group child seriously neglect research conduct past 2 decade . Little known , part field lack tool ass , often pose significant behavioral challenge preclude participation research study . Among ~70 % individual ASD speak language skill , 50 % language impair ; remain group normal language score standardized test . Thus , enormous heterogeneity verbal ability ASD . To date , study brain cognitive mechanism underlie heterogeneity remain quite limited . At cognitive level , current research suggest language impairment verbal child ASD involve deficit phonological work memory , evident test nonsense word repetition . The area language affect group include complex syntax morphology relate mark tense ( Tager-Flusberg et al. , 2005 ) . There also considerable evidence MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) study child adult difference volume asymmetry language region cortex , specifically Broca 's Wernicke 's area . Recent study suggest difference necessarily track degree language impairment , though conflicting finding literature . Importantly , participant cognitive neuroimaging study ASD adult individual relatively intact language . Far less know process ( either cognitive neural ) might implicate minimally verbal group . This project design address issue use two different brain imaging method approach . 1. fMRI DTI : Converging line evidence support view ASDs disorder connectivity , abnormalities white matter integrity reduce coordination activity across brain region give rise core feature . Recent result group ( Guenther ; Manoach ) identify white matter anomaly speech network high-functioning verbal adult ASD , specifically pathway leave supplementary motor area ( SMA ) leave ventral premotor cortex ( vPMC ) , pathway involved initiation speech output accord Directions Velocities Articulators ( DIVA ) model speech production , lead model neural computation underlie speech . These connectivity abnormality reveal DTI functional connectivity analysis collect use fMRI . NOTE : IRB approval collection fMRI/DTI data obtain MGH , portion study carry . Data analysis carry MGH BU . 2 . Electrophysiology : EEG/ERP It long known child ASD fail respond spoken , cover ear presence certain sound , yet show highly acute hearing context . Little known mechanism might underlie unusual auditory processing profile . Abnormal neural oscillation find endophenotype ASD infant adult . However , picture oscillation differ non-clinical subject unclear depend age test . Characterizing oscillation present brain range adolescent allow u quantify relationship neural activity severity language impairment . The main hypothesis test project abnormal neural connectivity minimally verbal child ASD profoundly impede ability perceptually organize auditory scene meaningful unit object , direct effect language development individual . Event-related brain potential ( ERPs ) frequency-based analysis electroencephalogram ( EEG ) collect passive listening task , evaluate auditory perception perceptual organization tone speech use mismatch negativity ( MMN ) paradigm ( MMN reflect passive deviance detection process index low-level acoustic process automatic sensory memory mechanism , widely investigate study auditory perceptual discrimination tone speech ) . The investigator plan collect data 3 group adolescent ASD vary language skill ( minimally verbal , verbal-language impaired , verbal-language normal ) age gender match non-ASD typical adolescent . The participant diagnose test use range standardize non-standardized assessment include IQ/cognitive level ; social ability ; ASD severity ; communication skill ( nonverbal ) . These assessment carry trained examiner clinical core house BU . Because many participant present highly challenge behavior difficult test , number innovative approach take maximize participant ' success complete behavioral assessment , tolerate provide artifact-free data electrophysiological MRI portion study . Overall , investigator hypothesize group test differ neural index auditory perception , neural index perceptual organization , induced neural oscillation . Further , investigator hypothesize difference degree language impairment across group correlate difference degree abnormality measure neural index , form abnormality , suggest root cause difference across test subject group quantitative rather qualitative .</detailed_description>
