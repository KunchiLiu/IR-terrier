	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose vaccine therapy treat patient malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor remove surgery ( unresectable ) come back period improvement ( recurrent ) . Vaccines make gene-modified virus may kill tumor cell express gene call neurofibromin 1 ( NF1 ) without affect surround normal cell may also help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor That Recurrent Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) intratumoral administration Edmonston strain measles virus genetically engineer express neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NIS ) ( oncolytic measles virus encode thyroidal sodium iodide symporter [ MV-NIS ] ) patient inoperable recurrent malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ( MPNST ) . II . To determine safety toxicity intratumoral administration MV-NIS patient inoperable recurrent MPNST . III . To preliminarily assess antitumor efficacy intratumoral MV-NIS administration rate progression-free survival 3 month , achieve follow radiographic response treat lesion use World Health Organization ( WHO ) response criterion guideline . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time course viral gene expression virus elimination biodistribution virally infected cell various time point infection MV-NIS use single-photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) /computed tomography ( CT ) imaging . II . To assess viremia , viral replication , measles virus shedding/persistence follow intratumoral administration . III . To determine humoral cellular immune response inject virus . IV . To assess quality-of-life patient treat MV-NIS , use two inventory ( Pain Fatigue ) . V. To assess time progression difference growth rate treat untreated tumor lesion . VI . To assess overall survival time patient treat MV-NIS . OUTLINE : Patients receive MV-NIS intratumorally day 1 . Patients also undergo SPECT/CT baseline 3 8 day MV-NIS . Patients may also undergo SPECT/CT 15 28 day , 6 week base whether uptake prior imaging study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month .</detailed_description>
