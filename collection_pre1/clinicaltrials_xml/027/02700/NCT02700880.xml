	<brief_summary>The WEARIT-III registry enroll subject ischemic cardiomyopathy heart failure ( include NYHA II , III , IV ejection fraction ≤ 35 % ) wear medically prescribe ZOLL LifeVest Wearable Defibrillator . The primary objective WEARIT-III Registry prospectively document clinical course high-risk cardiac patient heart failure ischemic cardiomyopathy prescribe Wearable Cardioverter Defibrillator ( WCD ) , leave ventricular function recovery , arrhythmia , Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator ( ICD ) , Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy ( CRT ) , Left Ventricular Assist Device ( LVAD ) , heart transplantation , assess benefit WCD heart failure patient ischemic cardiomyopathy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY PROCEDURE U.S. patient prescribe commercially available WCD ( ZOLL LifeVest ) approach letter sponsor summarize study purpose procedure . Once patient sign consent form participate study , receive three questionnaire University Rochester , coordination data center WEARIT registry , time enrollment , 3 month 12 month follow-up , respectively . At 3 12-month follow-up , physician patient contact provide information arrhythmia , interim event ( ICD , CRT LVAD implantation , heart failure episode , death ) , send u related hospital report echocardiogram report ass improvement leave ventricular function . STUDY DESIGN WEARIT-III prospective observational patient registry . Optimal pharmacologic and/or implanted device therapy anticipate , Registry physicians involve medical care subject , collect information standard care patient . In WEARIT-III also retrieve hospital records/echocardiogram report subject follow-up use authorization form sign study subject contact physician collect information improvement leave ventricular function whenever available . DATA MANAGEMENT , DATA STORAGE Once consent , device recording prescribe information obtain device provider . Data subject-completed questionnaire also obtain . Data enter web-based , password-protected clinical data-management system . That data doubled-checked accuracy personnel work Registry . All study document keep locked file room . All computer password-protected keep locked area . DATA ANALYSIS Routine patient clinical data well WCD data clinical outcome 1 year follow-up record study patient enter study-specific data- management system use exist data management system Heart Research Follow-up Program . All analysis perform base primary secondary objective . Patient 's clinical characteristic record present descriptive statistic . Change clinical course record descriptive statistic compare pre- WCD post-WCD . Time-to-event analysis perform assess time medication optimization . Clinical event present person-time rate compare previous WCD study . Adverse event evaluate raw count percentage . Compliance analyze mean median length use daily wear time .</detailed_description>
