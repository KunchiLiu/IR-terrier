	<brief_summary>Patients cohort compose 50 consecutive patient male female hepatic malignancy , refer nuclear medicine department process radioembolization January 2010- August 2015 . 26 patient examine Tc99-MAA SPECT-CT 24 patient examine Tc99-MAA , SPECT-CT PET-CT. Our study protocol follow : 1 . Collection anamnestic data 2 . Calculation liver tumor volume quantification software 3 . Evaluation liver tumor involvement 4 . Evaluation liver lung shunt 5 . Calculation dose SIRTEX 6 . Y90 image 7 . Follow Up</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Added Value Hybrid Functional Anatomical Imaging PET-CT SPECT-CT Patients Treated With Y-90 SIRT Liver Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The description various stage patient go SIRTex treatment department nuclear medicine roll study follow : The first stage dedicate evaluation patient 's illegibility treatment . 1 . In Angiography department 2 . In Nuclear medicine department assessment liver-lung shunting ( planar image ) . Followed SPECT-CT upper abdomen . SPECT Low dose CT use identify leak stomach , duodenum mesentery , well assess uptake Tc-99m-MAA tumor lesion . In order increase SPECT-CT resolution sensitivity co-registrated SPECT-CT diagnostic CT provide previous contrast enhance CT PET-CT . In procedure , Low dose CT use bridge diagnostic CT functional imaging SPECT . 3 . Calculation dose Sirtex therapy . At stage purpose study investigate add value SPECT-CT estimation Tc-99m-MAA uptake tumor lesion . The second stage dedicate assessment Y-90-SIRTex uptake liver tumor exclude extra hepatic leak . Several hour treatment patient perform SPECT-CT use Brummshtrullung emission PET-CT peak Zr-90 . At stage , study , compare liver lesion uptake Tc-99m-MAA SPECT-CT lesion uptake Y-90 -SIRT SPECT/PET-CT well assess SPECT-CT withTc-99m-MAA may use predictor Y-90-SIRTex uptake liver lesion . Does SPECT-CT Tc-99m-MAA change patient managment . The third stage study collection monitor post treatment outcome data .</detailed_description>
