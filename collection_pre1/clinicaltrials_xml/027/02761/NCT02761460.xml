	<brief_title>The Efficacy Safety PEG-rhG-CSF Preventing Chemotherapy-induced Neutropenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neutrophilic granulocytopenia one common serious complication chemotherapy . Research show 25 % ~ 40 % patient receive standard chemotherapy appear neutropenia fever . It increase risk infection Chemotherapy relate death , lead delay chemotherapy , maybe Reduce curative effect chemotherapy . RhG-CSF widely use prevent neutropenia , half-time short , need daily injection maintain effective blood drug concentration . Patients poor compliance , related adverse reaction medical cost increase . At time , patient appear neutropenia thought RhG-CSF give . Therefore , reduce frequency RhG-CSF injection effectively prevent neutropenia effectively , premise ensure safety patient achieve good effect chemotherapy , always focus clinical problem . Pegylated recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( PEG-rhG-CSF ) first class national new drug develop domestic pharmaceutical company . According phase Ⅱand phase Ⅲ clinical trial , PEG-rhG-CSF good effect . The patient need one injection PEG-rhG-CSF Cycle chemotherapy , effect rise white blood cell smoothly , avoid pain repeat injection PEG-rhG-CSF</detailed_description>
