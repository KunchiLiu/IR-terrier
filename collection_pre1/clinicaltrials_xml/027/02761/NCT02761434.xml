	<brief_title>The Effect Vasopressin Glucose Regulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction The neurohypophysial hormone arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) , also know antidiuretic hormone , one first hormone identify vasopressin property 1895 Oliver Schäfer . They show extract pituitary gland increase blood pressure anesthetize dog . AVP mainly synthesize paraventricular supraoptic nucleus hypothalamus . The hormone transfer neural lobe posterior pituitary release circulation . Target organ perceive hormonal stimulus three different receptor : V1a , V1b V2 . The receptor V1a mainly express vascular wall responsible vasoconstriction . The receptor V1b mainly find anterior pituitary , mediate secretion adrenal corticotropin hormone , V2 receptor mainly express nephron tubule trigger water reabsorption . Since discovery AVP , vasopressin antidiuretic property well study document . Other AVP effect blood pressure water homeostasis , hormone implicate variety function include pain , bone lipid metabolism , hypertension , social behavior , age , cognitive function , cellular proliferation , inflammation , infection , homeostasis , hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis , diabetes . All effect could provide useful insight many disease . Therefore , focus application effect AVP glucose regulation healthy human . AVP known enhance hepatic glycogenolysis activation V1a receptor increase release glucagon , result increase glucose level experimental animal . Even glucagon receptor liver block , AVP still increase blood glucose . The V1b receptor identify alpha beta cell islet Langerhans . Thus , AVP stimulate insulin secretion counteract increase blood glucose . In experiment AVP V1a V1b receptor knockout mouse , alteration glucose fat metabolism observe , suggest AVP might play role glucose regulation metabolic disorder . Studies humans genetic variation AVP V1a receptor show increased prevalence diabetes overweight subject high fat diet . Recently , study rat prone metabolic dysfunction , examined effect long-term influence vasopressin glucose homeostasis . It report high vasopressin enhance hyperinsulemia glucose intolerance obese rat , treatment vasopressin receptor V1a antagonist reduce glucose intolerance . In French epidemiological study , cohort 3,615 male female normal fast blood glucose follow 9 year . It indicate water intake inversely independently associate risk develop hyperglycemia . The author hypothesize result due hypohydration related increase plasma vasopressin . More recently , Swedish cohort 2,064 subject malmo diet cancer study analyze 15.8 oral glucose tolerance test . They find copeptin ( reliable clinical surrogate marker AVP ) independently predict diabetes mellitus abdominal adiposity . Interestingly , hypohydration low water drinking link chronic elevated AVP . In recent study free-living adult , low habitual water intake lead significantly elevate AVP compare adult high water intake . Experimental Design Sixty subject age 30 55 absence insulin resistance recruit study . Thirty adult normal body mass index ( BMI ; 15 male 15 female , 18.5 kg∙m-2 &lt; BMI ≤25 kg∙m-2 ) thirty overweight obese adult ( 15 male 15 female , 28 kg∙m-2 ≤ BMI ≤35 kg∙m-2 ) recruit participate study . Sample size estimation show 60 subject provide power 0.8 alpha level set 0.05 . The effect vasopressin glucose metabolism study via osmotic stimulation vasopressin ( AVP ) utilize hypertonic saline infusion follow oral glucose tolerance test . Each subject perform two identical experiment , differ sodium chloride ( NaCl ) content infusion ( isotonic vs. hypertonic saline ) . All female subject perform trial early follicular phase , approximately 2-6 day post menses onset ensure low endogenous level estrogen progesterone . After rest seated position 30 min , subject infuse intravenously either 3 % NaCl ( Hypertonic saline , hence HYPER ) 0.9 % NaCl ( Isotonic saline , hence ISO ) 120 min period infusion rate 0.1 ml/min/kg body weight single-blind fashion counterbalance order . This hypertonic saline infusion increase plasma osmolality 285 least 300 mmol/kg . From separate venous catheter , blood sample take every 30 min . Following infusion , subject rest equilibration period 30 min start 4-h oral glucose tolerance test . Subject preparation oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) : Subjects eat normal diet 3 day prior test , undertake normal physical activity . Dinner standardize day alcohol allow . Subjects instruct fast least 10 h prior test . Procedure OGTT : The OGTT test consist 75 g glucose ingestion follow blood sampling period , sample collect every 30 min 240 min . Urine sample collect end infusion end OGTT . Blood pressure record via automate sphygmomanometer follow blood sample . Oxygen uptake respiratory exchange rate assess hourly via indirect calorimetry , total seven time per trial . During blood sampling , thirst perception mouth dryness also assess via visual analog scale . Samples Analysis A total fourteen blood sample collect experimental trial analyze : hematocrit ( Hct ) , hemoglobin ( Hb ) , osmolality ( Osm ) , sodium ( Na ) potassium ( K ) , total plasma protein , glucose , insulin , c-peptide , glucagon , copeptin , plasma renin activity , corticotropin release hormone ( CRF ) , cortisol , triglyceride free fatty acid ( FFA ) . Urine sample analyze osmolality urine specific gravity fresh . Backup sample serum , plasma , urine store , frozen -80°C , event additional analysis need , replacement broken vial . Data Handling &amp; Analysis To ensure quality integrity data collect case report form utilized . The case report form ( CRF ) design record data collect way meet high standard . CRF develop , test approve prior subject enrolment . The scientist involve data collection study train use CRF prior begin data collection . A paper digital library CRFs establish maintain experiment least 2 year publication manuscript . The data base manager principal investigator person access identifiable subject information . All rest document cod ensure subject anonymity . Data Safety Monitoring Plan include : Overall framework data safety monitoring , responsible party monitoring , procedure report adverse events/unanticipated problem . Following data collection , data entry take place two authorized scientist . Data Quest diagnostics available PDF format data entry also perform verified two scientist . Data integration database cleaning perform statistical software via analysis visualization . The primary response variable glucose metabolism capture 4 variable ( glucose , insulin , C-Peptide glucagon ) measure ratio scale , 14 occasion . Secondary Outcomes : Hb , Hct , Total Proteins , Osmolality , Na , K , Copeptin , adrenal corticosteropin release hormone ( ACTH ) , CRH , Angiotensin II , plasma renin activity ( PRA ) , Aldosterone , Triglycerides , FFA . Additional repeat continuous outcome : ( 1 ) Blood pressure measure 14 occasion ; ( 2 ) Oxygen uptake respiratory exchange rate assess 7 separate occasion ; ( 3 ) thirst perception mouth dryness measure 14 occasion . Covariates Measurements Treatment group ( isotonic vs. hypertonic saline ) primary comparison interest . Other covariates include sex ( Females vs. male ) weight status ( normal weight vs. overweight/obese ) , age ( 30-55 ) time ( 1-14 ) . To examine mean response profile similar group , i.e . whether pattern change time mean response vary group , present study explore group time interaction effect : ( e.g . treatment time interaction ; weight time interaction ; sex time interaction ) . Data Analysis Plan - For quasi-experimental repeated measure-design , researcher conduct longitudinal analysis describe change mean response time , change relate covariates interest . - The normality continuous variable assess conduct Shapiro-Wilk test normality . - For continuous outcome , summary statistic ( mean standard deviation ) conduct time sequence . Moreover , correlation glucose metabolism measure perform . - Percentages calculate covariates measure nominal scale , mean ± standard deviation present measure continuous scale . - The distribution insulin sensitivity index area curve assess . Statistical Modeling To study change mean response relate covariates time , Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Modeling -with random intercept slopes- employed use Restricted Maximum Likelihood Estimation . It assume group 's mean response change linearly time . However , mean response time linear , higher-order polynomial trend explore . The researcher fit appropriate covariance pattern model account correlation among repeated measure appropriate inference make . Statistical significance determine alpha 0.05 . All statistical analysis would carry follow statical software STATA© , JMP© SAS© . Anticipated Findings Conclusions During hypertonic saline infusion trial water balance artificially manipulate ( hypertonic hypervolemia ) . The increase plasma osmolality stimulate vasopressin secretion . It anticipate AVP stimulation elevate insulin great degree glucose result high insulin resistance . It also expect great urine osmolality response elevate vasopressin level low urinary output . Significance Project Diabetes along obesity one lead non-communicable disease develop develop country . More 29 million Americans diabetic another 86 million pre-diabetic state . The cost diabetes 2012 $ 245 billion grow . Hypohydration side , quite common phenomenon link many health issue like urinary tract infection , kidney stone , cardiovascular disease , mood state cognitive performance . One potential mechanism behind effect hypohydration elevate level AVP . Recent epidemiological data experiment animal indicate hypohydration high vasopressin link diabetes glucose dysregulation . However , experimental data control trial human exist . The purpose propose study perform control trial healthy human examine effect elevate vasopressin glucose regulation .</detailed_description>
