	<brief_summary>Pediatric mastocytosis orphan disease , encompass several clinically distinct entity include solitary mastocytoma , urticaria pigmentosa , diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis newly recognize mast cell activation syndrome . The common form pediatric mastocytosis cutaneous maculopapular mastocytosis ( CMPM ) , also know urticaria pigmentosa ( UP ) . There significant knowledge gap regard genetic basis pediatric mastocytosis functional activity mast cell condition . The Pediatric Dermatology Pediatric Oncology service University Minnesota Masonic Children 's Hospital see significant growth clinical volume pediatric mastocytosis , include rare , familial case . The aim study prospectively explore germline risk UP perform mutational analysis identify somatic mutation , beyond currently identify , pediatric patient UP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cutaneous Mastocytosis Children : Analysis Somatic Germline Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urticaria pigmentosa ( UP ) relatively common disorder pediatric patient , little known regard somatic germline genetic variant associate disease . The University Minnesota Masonic Children 's Hospital regional referral center pediatric patient mast cell disorder . Collaborators study include several University department include : Pediatric Dermatology , Pediatric Oncology , Biomedical Genomics program , Lab Medicine Pathology department . We hypothesize difference observe clinical behavior pediatric- adult-onset mast cell disease , specifically UP , identify novel somatic gene variant addition c-KIT . We hypothesize observe novel germline genetic variant pediatric UP distinct previously describe adult . Specific Aims include follow : Specific Aim 1 : RNA Sequencing Gene Expression Mutation Analysis . Utilizing RNA sequencing ( RNA-Seq ) , perform pair lesional peripheral blood sequence UP case identify variation gene expression define novel somatic mutation associate pediatric UP . Specific Aim 2 : Exploration Germline Risk . Utilizing single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) array , perform linkage analysis UP case unaffected family member identify germline genetic variant associate UP . 1 . Discordant sibling analysis : Children UP unaffected sibling compare identify germline variant . 2 . Identical twin parent analysis : Identical infant twin severe UP phenotype compare unaffected parent .</detailed_description>
