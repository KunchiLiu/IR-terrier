	<brief_summary>Miscarriage common event associate severe psychological social morbidity , torment woman suffer recurrent pregnancy loss ( RPL ) least three consecutive loss . Ultrasonography biomarkers yet precisely predict viability pregnancy symptoms threatening miscarriage . A novel biomarker Preimplantation Factor ( PIF ) derive develop embryo might key factor prediction ameliorate implantation process promote favorable local immune system uterus . The investigator aim establish prospective early pregnancy cohort ( PEP-cohort ) include woman throughout first trimester assist reproductive technology ( ART ) spontaneous conception . By combination consecutive ultrasonographys blood sample know predictor implantation PIF predictor viability evaluate . These data finally compare data retrospective cohort RPL patient emphasize role PIF . All collect data store Research Biobank current study outline well potential future study reproductive medicine first trimester .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Pregnancy Cohort Preimplantation Factor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator aim evaluate Preimplantation Factor ( PIF ) throughout first trimester need employ two setting recruitment . Early part : The PEP ART ( PEP-A ) enroll participant refer fertility treatment Rigshospitalet North Zealand Hospital . Participants cryopreserved embryos suitable frozen embryo transfer natural menstrual cycle . No type ovulation trigger employ , LH peak monitor via home urine-LH test . For thorough examination luteal phase , participant recall blood sample day 7 , 11 , 14 16 positive urine-LH test . Hereafter positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) denote pregnancy participant offer continue late part PEP-cohort . Late part : PEP Spontaneous conception ( PEP-S ) represent sample expect normal pregnancy local community . Enrolled time first positive pregnancy test , participant expect include approximately 5 week gestation . Hereafter participant recall every two week blood sample transvaginal ultrasonographys endometrial thickness gestational sac yolk sac visible mean sac diameter measure eventually crown-rump-length . Research biobank All collect data : questionnaire medical history enrollment , ultrasonographys blood sample progesterone , 17-OH-progesterone , estradiol , alpha-feto-protein ( AFP ) , pregnancy associate placental protein A ( PAPP-A ) , hCG PIF store research biobank .</detailed_description>
