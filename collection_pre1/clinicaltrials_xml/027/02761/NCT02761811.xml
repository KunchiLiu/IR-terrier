	<brief_summary>To evaluate safety efficacy target renal sympathetic denervation use SyMapCath I™ patient pharmacotherapy uncontrolled hypertension least 6 month , standardized antihypertensive drug therapy ( least two drug ) least 28 day , office systolic blood pressure ( BP ) still ≥ 150mmHg , ≤180mmHg .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sympathetic Mapping/ Ablation Renal Nerves Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multicenter , single blind , randomize control trial , patient diagnose essential hypertension least six month disease history pharmacotherapy however blood pressure still control . The patient inform , consent get screen process . During screening period patient receive standardized antihypertensive drug treatment least 28 day office BP still ≥ 150mmHg , ≤180mmHg , meet inclusion exclusion criterion . These patient conduct renal artery angiography allocate either renal sympathetic nerve denvervation group renal artery angiography group randomize system 1:1 ratio ( 212 patient , 106 paires ) . Patients office BP achieve ideal level ( &lt; 140 mmHg ) titrate dos class antihypertensive drug accord predefined standardized medication regimen office BP &lt; 140 mmHg . Physicians perform post-procedure patient management physician perform renal denvervation procedure blind . Patients follow 7 day procedure discharge hospital , 1 month , 2 month , 3 month , 4 month , 5 month , 6 month , 9 month 12months . Urine sample collect drug test determine drug compliance patient . Data collecting/management/statistical analysis laboratory test perform independent , qualified organization . Independent DSMB/CEC form responsible assessment protocol deviation nature SAEs .</detailed_description>
