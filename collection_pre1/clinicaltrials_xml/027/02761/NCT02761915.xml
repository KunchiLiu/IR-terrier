	<brief_summary>The purpose first human study determine safety feasibility 1RG-CART therapy patient relapse refractory neuroblastoma . 1RG-CART therapy novel immunotherapy investigation patient T-cells ( type white blood cell ) collect modified laboratory , give back patient . The T-cells modified express chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) target disialoganglioside ( GD2 ) , marker express surface neuroblastoma cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Cancer Research UK Trial Anti-GD2 T-cells ( 1RG-CART )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose trial explore feasibility deploy autologous anti-GD2 CAR T-cells immunotherapy neuroblastoma . The CAR T-cell trial employ second generation receptor lymphodepleting condition regime produce objective clinical response patient relapse leukaemias . The current trial aim evaluate similar CAR T-cells direct antigen GD2 . Neuroblastoma well suit form target therapy homogeneous almost universal expression GD2 surface neuroblastoma cell , poor prognosis eligible patient . 1RG-CART administer intravenously . As CAR T-cells design survive proliferate encounter antigen , direct relationship anticipate cell dose either efficacy toxicity . Rather , clinical benefit likely observe patient vivo expansion successfully occur . A possible key determinant expansion prior lymphodepletion patient . For reason trial design evaluate phase introduction lymphodepletion successive patient cohort , rather T-cell dose escalation . Only insufficient expansion T-cells follow full lymphodepletion T-cell dose escalate .</detailed_description>

Karnofsky score ≥60 % ≥16 year old Lansky performance score ≥60 % &lt; 16 year old Informed consent patient‟s parent legal guardian require patient 16 year age . Patients 16 year age may also provide write assent take part trial . Patients meet ( anticipated meet ) exclusion criterion main trial , see criterion Eligibility Criteria Main Trial 1 . Histologically proven neuroblastoma , relapse refractory conventional treatment . 2 . Patients must least one lesion evaluate response image and/or diffuse bone marrow infiltration . 3 . Aged ≥12 month time write consent give dose escalation phase age ≥6 month time write consent give dose expansion phase trial . 4 . Life expectancy least two month . 5 . Karnofsky score ≥60 % ≥16 year old Lansky performance score ≥60 % &lt; 16 year old 6 . Adequate renal function , define GFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73m^2 ( correct ) . 7 . Written ( sign date ) inform consent main trial* capable cooperate treatment followup . 1 . Patients receive antiGD2 antibody treatment within previous 2 week ( base half life ch14.18 antibody 13 day child ) ; patient receive dinutuximab antiGD2directed antibody may need long washout period . 2 . Patients rituximab contraindicate due severe previous hypersensitivity reason . 3 . Patients must recover acute reversible effect previous therapy infusion 1RGCART . 4 . Current CNS involvement ( include intradural meningeal involvement ) . Patients previously CNS involvement surgically treat disease free ≥2 month eligible . 5 . Coexisting chronic progressive neurological disease . 6 . Airway compromise direct tumoural invasion compression . 7 . Patients active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment . 8 . Patients take likely require high dose systemic corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy ( patient steroid replacement therapy eligible ) . 9 . Patients high medical risk nonmalignant systemic disease include active uncontrolled infection . 10 . Major surgery patient yet recover . 11 . Female patient able become pregnant ( already pregnant lactate ) . However , patient negative serum urine pregnancy test enrolment agree use two highly effective form contraception ( oral ; inject implant hormonal contraception condom ; intrauterine device condom ; diaphragm spermicidal gel condom ) effective first administration lymphodepleting regimen administration 1RGCART ( whichever come first ) , throughout trial six month afterwards consider eligible . Note female patient receive cyclophosphamide rituximab , contraceptive period extend 12 month cyclophosphamide/rituximab administration . 12 . Male patient partner childbearing potential ( unless agree take measure father child use one form highly effective contraception [ condom plus spermicide ] effective first administration lymphodepleting regimen administration 1RGCART [ whichever come first ] , throughout trial six month afterwards ) . Men pregnant lactate partner must advise use barrier method contraception ( example : condom plus spermicidal gel ) prevent exposure foetus neonate . 13 . Known serologically positive hepatitis B , hepatitis C HIV . 14 . Any condition Investigator‟s opinion would make patient good candidate clinical trial . 15 . Is participant another clinical trial investigational medicinal product ( CTIMP ) . Participation observational trial followup phase CTIMP would acceptable .</criteria>
