	<brief_summary>Despite U.S. guideline influenza vaccination child start age 6 month , half child vaccinate annually leading substantial influenza disease child spread disease adult . A major barrier family remind need child receive influenza vaccination . The investigator evaluate impact patient reminder/recall ( R/R ) perform state immunization information system improve influenza vaccination rate use three clinical trial two state . The investigator assess effectiveness cost-effectiveness phone reminder/recall improve influenza vaccination rate . The investigator disseminate state immunization information system base reminder/recall system state use seasonal pandemic influenza vaccination goal lower influenza morbidity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Centralized IIS-based Reminder/Recall Increase Childhood Influenza Vaccination Rates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Annual epidemic seasonal influenza cause substantial morbidity mortality U.S. high rate hospitalization , emergency department outpatient visit , medical cost . Children experience significant morbidity influenza , also play critical role spread infection adult . Since 2010 , Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) recommend influenza vaccination child &gt; 6 month age . However , vaccination rate remain low -- 56 % child 2-17 year vaccinate . Low rate concern seasonal influenza preparation pandemic influenza . One nationally recommended strategy raise childhood influenza vaccination rate use parent reminder/recall ( R/R ) phone mail , raise rate 20 percentage point . However , less 16 % primary care practice use R/R despite many study show effectiveness . Statewide immunization information system ( IISs ) exist state track childhood vaccination , use R/R influenza vaccine lack evidence effectiveness lack template IIS-based R/R . The investigator unite two lead immunization research group ( Denver , CO Rochester , NY ) ass impact centralize IIS-based influenza vaccine R/R , evaluate effect intensity recall ( 1 v. 2 v. 3 reminder ) usual care . The investigator also develop tool aid state create efficient IIS R/R system seasonal possible pandemic influenza outbreak . This study four aim . Aim 1 develop protocol , clinical decision support , message content state IISs conduct reminder/recall influenza vaccination . Aim 2 conduct pragmatic trial , randomization level patient within practice randomly select proportionate state , compare : 1 ) effectiveness cost-effectiveness centralized R/R different intensity ( 1 vs. 2 vs. 3 message ) usual care ( 0 message ) 2 ) effectiveness cost-effectiveness R/R specify subgroup ( family medicine v pediatric provider , rural v urban , age child ) receipt influenza vaccination . Aim 3 measure effect add mail text message R/R autodialer failure vs. autodialer-alone R/R influenza vaccination rate use 2-arm Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) . Aim 4 ( dissemination aim ) develop toolkit state IIS-based influenza vaccine R/R seasonal pandemic influenza , work key stakeholder sustainability plan . By end study investigator feasible cost-effective model raise child seasonal possibly pandemic influenza vaccination rate prevent influenza . The investigator disseminate IIS model state .</detailed_description>
