	<brief_title>Clinical Radiographic Evaluation Crestal Bone Loss Around Implant With Without Platform Switching Design</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The peri-implant bone level use one criterion ass success dental implant , Platform switching ( PLS ) maintain peri-implant bone level gain popularity among implant manufacturer last year . However , assumption inward shift implant- abutment junction may preserve crestal bone primarily base serendipitous find rather scientific evidence . It known saucerization around implant occurs follow abutment connection use submerge implant butt joint ( two-stage approach ) , Branemark implant . The nature saucerization varies accord implant type ( one-stage two-stage ) abutment connection type . report factor likely cause early crestal bone loss around implant : 1 . The micro-gap , 2 . The implant crest module , 3 . Occlusal overload , 4 . The biologic width around dental implant . At Toronto Conference 1998 , consensus respect bone loss around implant bone loss approximately 2 mm first year implant function acceptable , level implant regard successful . There many report study ascertain cause bone loss around implant clinical technique prevent . Some report publish 2005 2006 state platform switching technique , technique abutment one-size small implant platform place , prevent bone loss around implant . However , report mechanism action extent bone loss prevention , , difficult say effect PLS thoroughly examine . This review article examine PLS technique bone loss preventive effect . A lot clinical study discuss concept platform switch extensively study histologically biomechanically . In histomorphometric study dog significant difference marginal bone level around platform- switch -matched implant 28 day heal . In contrast , study report significantly less bone loss around platform-switched implant load period 2 6months . However , consistency among study respect study design ( e.g . location depth implant , controlled/non-controlled ) , , difficult evaluate study use evaluation method . The review meta-analysis show platform switch may preserve interimplant bone height soft tissue level . The degree marginal bone resorption inversely related extent implant- abutment mismatch . But still general agreement confirm validity concept , Further long-term , well-conducted , randomize controlled study need confirm validity concept .</detailed_description>
