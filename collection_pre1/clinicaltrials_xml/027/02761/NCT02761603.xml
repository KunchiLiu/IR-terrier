	<brief_summary>Over 30 % American adult hypertension ( HTN ) ( high blood pressure ) , rate increase considerably age ; 64 % men 78 % woman 65 HTN . High blood pressure associate HTN force blood artery wall enough pressure eventually cause health problem , heart disease stroke . HTN one significant cause early death worldwide one preventable cause death . Many study reveal lower blood pressure ( BP ) reduce incidence disease heart blood vessel . Non-drug related treatment know reduce BP great effect public health . Research suggest Tai Chi ( TC ) effective lower BP patient HTN , low quality exist study definite proof . Also , know TC reduces BP . One possibility TC practice , show reduce psychological distress anxiety depression reduce body 's response stress , improve balance autonomic nervous system ( part nervous system control beat heart widen narrow blood vessel ) . This may lead low BP . The investigator plan investigate pathway among autonomic , blood vessel , immune psychological factor relation BP change response 12-weeks TC compare Healthy Aging Practice-centered Education ( HAP-E ) . 250 old adult ( 60+ year old ) mild HTN enrol , investigator take several measurement heart nervous system function . The investigator hypothesize perform TC 12 week result autonomic `` re-regulation '' improve BP blood vessel health ( Aim 1 ) sympathetic nervous system ( part nervous system serf speed heart rate , contract blood vessel , raise blood pressure ) regulation immune system ( Aim 2 ) . Lastly , investigator hypothesize psychological factor relate TC effect autonomic regulation ( Aim 3 ) . Findings investigator study hopefully shed light pathway TC reduce BP . Also , particular effect TC ( `` meditative movement '' ) old , `` hard-to-treat '' hypertensive population well understood .</brief_summary>
