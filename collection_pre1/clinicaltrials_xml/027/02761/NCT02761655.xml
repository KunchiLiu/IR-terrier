	<brief_summary>Background Purpose : Previous study indicate baseline cognitive ability , especially prospective memory ( PM ) significantly influence medication adherence . However , three qualify intervention study adherences person cognitive impairment ( PWCIs ) . In addition , family caregiver ( FCGs ) often ask assist PWCIs manage medication FCGs ' medication administration hassle intensively investigate . Therefore , purpose project test effectiveness efficacy theoretical-based multifaceted memory intervention medication administration quality life PWCIs living home medication administration hassle FCGs . Study Design : This three-year project ( 2015 , 8 , 1-2018 , 7 , 31 ) . The aims first-year study : 1.to develop multifaceted memory intervention base paradigm prospective memory ( PM ) ; 2. pilot test feasibility multifaceted memory intervention small randomize control trial . The aims second- third year study : 3. examine effectiveness efficacy intervention ( randomize control trial ) . The intervention group receive cognitive impairment education , medication adherence memory strategy train , control group receive cognitive impairment education program . The duration intervention one month . There 4 data collection ( baseline , post-intervention 2 4 , 6 month ) . Sample size estimation pilot study 5 dyad group . Sample size randomize clinical trial 84 dyad ( 42 dyad per group ) . After attrition rate ( 10 % ) count , total , 200 case ( 100 dyad ) . Implications project : This three-year program help identify may benefit memory train assist may incompetent live community . Also program extend current knowledge role PM play medication adherence behavior relationship self awareness well everyday decision making among PWCIs . In addition , health relate professional improve PWCI 's quality care reduce FCG hassle apply theoretical guided practice memory training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>These dyad participant give information follow phone call schedule home visit initial screening ( 24 &lt; MMSE &lt; 27 ) . During home visit , participant give consent form explanation project regard purpose , length data collection type measure study . Investigator use electronic monitoring system ( EMS ) develop Professor Heh 's lab , Chung Yuan Christian University Phase I monitor medication adherence behavior pilot test agreement pill count FCG observation diary . Investigator apply compensation participant finish initial adherence observation ( 4 week ) ( baseline data collection ) . Those enrolled 6 month intervention phase receive additional compensation fund . The research assistants receive train previous project ( MOST 102-2314-B-182-050-MY2 ) investigator recruit new part-time research assistant , nurse master student , receive one-month training course , include : purpose study , procedure recruitment , test battery interview skill , test battery scoring system , data collection use EMS , data download EMS , basic statistical technique . Then newly train part-time assistant go participate site observe least three PWCIs , practice interview skill dyad , familiarize outpatient clinical operational system . The on-site participant physician memory disorder clinic receive write letter explain purpose project eligible criterion dyad . These physician help investigator identify eligible dyad , train research assistant implement intervention education program . The part-time student assistant responsible data collection . The advantage investigator team . The PI co-PIs come research lab-Healthy Aging Research Center , Cognitive Behavioral Indices Lab , Chang Gung University . This lab target population normal old adult dementia disability . Investigator develop assessment tool platform use share data Prospective Retrospective Memory Questionnaire ( PRMQ ) . In future , Investigator may share image technology . Therefore , investigator team advantage integration expertise . Interactions expert facilitate progress project . Specifically , Dr. Hsu ( neurologist ) provide clinical utility ensure formal diagnosis assessment PWCIs . The external consultant ( psychologist ) , Professor Hua , assist administer psychometric test , interpretation data , consultation content intervention . Investigator international collaboration partner Professor Jersey Liang University Michigan , USA longitudinal experimental data analysis consultation Dr. Heather Wilkinson Edinburgh University , UK focus dementia friendly community issue . Investigator hold monthly research meeting lab . Finally , PI research collaboration Professor Heh , Chung Yuan Christian University , work interactive mathematic training APP MCI patient . Based foundation , Investigator continue develop EMS project . Phase 1 ( 1st year ) procedure . After dyad sign consent form , Investigator spend 3 hour collect demographic data , test battery teach dyad move patient 's medication EMS box contain sensor record container open . Investigator tell dyad box help patient count medication pill must use medication-taking event . Investigator also teach FCGs fill medication diary observation patient ' medication take behavior . For medication organizer , Investigator ask move one medication system consistent measure . The baseline observation medication adherence last 4 week screen adherence problem define adherence less equal 90 % inter-dose interval 4-week medication monitoring period . The rationale inclusion criterion study find use EMS introduces novelty initially boost adherence . Since EMS new participant may experience novelty , Investigator adopt stringent criterion compare general definition medication adherence &gt; = 80 % inter-dose interval . At end 4 week , train part-time student assistant load medication adherence data remove system dyad 's house . If PWCIs multiple medication , Investigator select one ( prioritize order : dementia treatment , antipsychotic medicine , antihypertensive medicine ) . All participant dyad take turn use EMS system . During first 6 month first year , Investigator develop teach material protocol phase I pilot study . The intervention procedures pilot study consist 5 stage : ( 1 ) initial home visit baseline data collection ; ( 2 ) measurement baseline adherence 4 week ; ( 3 ) random assignment eligible participant sign inform consent form either intervention group educational comparison group ; ( 4 ) four weekly in-home nurse visit deliver intervention education control dyads ; ( 5 ) adherence monitor outcome measure ( 6 month period ) . When dyad participant refer physician , go five-stage procedure collect baseline data 4-week adherence data ( week 1 week 4 ) . Then dyads randomly assign one two condition . Different train research assistant conduct follow-up four-weekly in-home visit ( week 5-8 ) deliver intervention educational comparison . During follow-up ( week5-8 ) home visit , research nurse assign intervention group review recommend strategy tailor strategy base individual difference difficulty implement strategy . Problem-solving use help dyad . This intervention dose similar study include FCGs participate study control PWCIs ' awareness level medical decision making capacity . The fidelity intervention monitor PhD student , use voice recorder intervention nurse ' interaction dyad . Investigator track fidelity whether intervention protocol follow . Any difference intervention protocol examine review voice record . Fidelity education control group monitor procedure well . To prevent loss 5-month medication adherence end 1 month intervention phase , research assistant conduct home visit dyads every 2 month download medication adherence data EMS serve memory cue remind PWCIs take medication . This strategy consist investigator 's PM theory well Insel et al . may strengthen multifaceted memory intervention . However , research assistant ( ) make visit careful discuss intervention education intervention condition . Blindness . To avoid bias , PI part-time student nurse collect data well participate physician blind condition status dyad . Investigator hire two research assistant ( ) : one conduct memory intervention conduct education intervention without inference . These procedure ensure double blindness project . Feasibility Indicators Phase I-pilot study . The feasibility indicator pilot study include recruitment rate ( 60 % ) , attrition rate ( &lt; 20 % ) , protocol completion rate ( &gt; 80 % ) base investigator 's previous research experience recruit PWCIs multiple stimulation intervention leisure activity .</detailed_description>
