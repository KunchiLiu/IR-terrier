	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate whether brimonidine cream reduce IPL-induced inflammation term redness , swell pain patient facial vascular lesion ( telangiectasias ) . Furthermore , effect brimonidine cream IPL-efficacy evaluate one month final IPL-treatment . The hypothesis brimonidine , prove effective reduction symptomatic erythema patient rosacea , also may ability reduce IPL-induced erythema . Since potential reduction erythema cause vasoconstriction , brimonidine may reduce IPL-induced oedema pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Brimonidine Reduce Inflammation After IPL-treatment Patients With Facial Telangiectasias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design The study design dual-centre , randomize , intra-individual , split-face clinical control trial blind outcome assessment . A total 20 patient moderate severe facial telangiectasias , without clinical active dermatological disease skin , include . Severity distribution ( cheek , nose chin ) telangiectasias must symmetrical facial side individual patient inclusion . All patient receive IPL-treatments side face . Before first IPL-treatment , leave right side face randomize either brimonidine ( Mirvaso ) IPL-treatment air-cooling ( control ) , respectively . The study conduct international collaboration Bispebjerg Hospital , Department Dermatology Denmark `` Skinperium '' private practice Belgium . Interventions Patients ask attend 3 treatment day 2 follow-up visit . Treatment day plan 3 week interval ( ± 5 day ) follow-up visit plan trial day 2 ( one day treatment day 1 ) 1 month ( ± 5 day ) final treatment day . The consultation estimate last half hour two hour . Patients ask fill patient diary first 6 day follow-up visit trial day 2 . At treatment day , patient receive 1 ) IPL whole face , 2 ) brimonidine thereafter apply facial side randomize treatment follow 3 ) air-cooling , apply whole face patient accordance clinical guideline . Efficacy endpoints &amp; evaluation method Primary efficacy endpoint : To investigate whether topical brimonidine reduce IPL-induced inflammatory response Secondary efficacy endpoint : 1 . IPL-induced treatment efficacy telangiectasias without application brimonidine 2 . Patient-evaluated subjective discomfort pain treatment area 3 . Overall patient satisfaction Primary efficacy endpoint quantify reduction erythema oedema assess blinded clinical on-site evaluation blind photo-evaluation . Secondary efficacy endpoint regard point 1 quantify blind photo-evaluation obtain Visia camera , baseline-photos compare photo final follow-up visit . Point 2 3 evaluate two separate 0-10 point Visual Analogue Scales ( VAS ) discomfort/pain patient satisfaction , respectively . Patient satisfaction evaluate patient diary . Product Mirvaso® ( brimonidine tartrate ( 3,3mg/1g ) , Galderma Nordic ) One gram gel contain 3.3 mg brimonidine , equivalent 5 mg brimonidine tartrate . Excipient ( ) know effect : One gram gel contain 1 mg methylparahydroxybenzoate ( E218 ) 55 mg propylene glycol . Other excipients : - Carbomer Methylparahydroxybenzoate ( E218 ) Phenoxyethanol - Glycerol - Titanium dioxide - Propylene glycol - Sodium hydroxide - Purified water Statistic analysis Primary efficacy endpoint difference inflammation brimonidine vs. control . Wilcoxon signed-rank test use pair comparison evaluate eventual difference brimonidine vs. control . Analysis Per-Protocol include patient complete study accord protocol . Sample size Estimation sample size base clinical on-site evaluation inflammation 30 minute incubation brimonidine ( effect brimonidine evident 30 minute cf.´Summary Product Characteristics ) 24 hour application . With power 90 % , type I error probability 5 % estimate standard deviation 25 % , include 17 patient detect minimum relevant difference ( MIREDIF ) 20 % brimonidine control . We choose 20 % MIREDIF , since reduction inflammation &lt; 20 % , base resource economic point view consider clinical irrelevant . Based early experience duration trial , 15 % dropout rate take account therefore , total 20 patient include .</detailed_description>
