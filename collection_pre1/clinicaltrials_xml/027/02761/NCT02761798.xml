	<detailed_description>In 2011 report Disability , World Health Organization rat hearing loss prevalent disability world . More 30 % adult disable hearing loss complicate management comorbid disease . Isolation , mental illness lack family support negative impact invisible disability . In next 25 year number hearing impaired individual age 65 Canada double , time project 50 % shortfall audiological service provider . The resultant service deficit compound lack equipment familiarity hearing healthcare primary care level , cause increase inefficiency , unnecessary referral , unmet need . In Canada , critical need improve number health professional requisite skill meet need age population . This project aim develop novel approach address increase need hear healthcare adult manage strain healthcare system . Healthcare worker ( general practitioner , register nurse allied heath worker ) play important role support motivate adult seek help aid referral process . However , healthcare worker receive formal training identification , diagnosis , treatment option , referral process , special need old adult hear loss . This lack training , resource equipment significant gap care provide elderly impact aspects elder care . Undiagnosed/untreated hearing loss lead physiological change associate auditory deprivation , well psychosocial change social isolation depression . It result emotional , physical , cognitive , behavioral consequence include impaired activity daily live , decline independence reduce quality life . In spite prevalence impact hear loss benefit rehabilitation reduce psychological , social , emotional consequence hear loss , referral physician assessment rehabilitation low majority adult could benefit use hearing aid use technology . Early identification help reduce deleterious effect , lead easy adjustment hearing aid use . In spite numerous recent technological advance field hear amplification device , current technology may effective old adult central auditory processing cognitive processing difficulty . Additionally , untreated hearing loss lower performance aurally administer diagnostic test use quantify severity dementia significantly confound clinical picture population . Furthermore , use amplification associate reduction problem behavior person primary diagnosis Alzheimer 's disease reduction hear handicap person Alzheimer 's disease significant others . This study aim validate use tablet base audiometer provide accurate , efficient , cost-effective mean diagnosis hear condition control uncontrolled environment adult elderly population . Observations soundbooth iPad audiogram include follow frequency 250 , 500 , 1000 , 2000 , 4000 , 8000 Hz . Each iPad audiogram consist interactive game take approximately 5 minute complete . The conventional audiogram take place iPad audiogram . We expect study add maximum 20 minute enrol patient 's visit . The iPad audiogram observation use patient 's physician diagnostic treatment purpose .</detailed_description>
