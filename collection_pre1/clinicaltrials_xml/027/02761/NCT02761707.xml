	<brief_title>Unique Brainstem Biomarkers Early Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , devastate age-related disease clinically defined effect motor system , afflict six million people worldwide , impose enormous burden patient , relative , caretaker , society general . Diagnostic error common , particularly symptom first arise . The common misdiagnoses Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , essential tremor , vascular pseudo-Parkinson 's Disease . An accurate diagnosis typically make later stage disease mark irreversible damage occur within motor control system brain . Sensitive specific biomarkers early stage PD urgently need . Identification marker critical development assessment medication intervention design eliminate reduce gradual irreversible decline neuron involve disorder . This study seek establish sensitivity specificity appear unique brainstem biomarker PD - electrically induced trigeminal nerve blink reflex response - differentiation early stage PD normal control neurodegenerative disease early stage AD , progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP ) , diffuse Lewy Body disease ( DLBD ) . This study additionally compare biomarker olfactory test result .</detailed_description>
