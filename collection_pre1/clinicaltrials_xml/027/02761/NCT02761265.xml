	<detailed_description>Degenerative adult scoliosis result age relate change lead segmental instability , deformity stenosis . Although etiology unclear , degenerative adult scoliosis associate progressive asymmetric degeneration disc facet joint , typically lead stenosis . By virtue narrow spinal canal associate degeneration patient frequently develop back pain , well leg pain , weakness , numbness . With age population USA increase attention quality life versus cost issue current healthcare environment , degenerative adult scoliosis become considerable healthcare concern . Patients scoliosis demonstrate alter gait pattern . Such difference include decreased step length reduce range motion upper low extremity , asymmetry trunk rotation ground reaction force three-dimensions . Mahaudens et al . find decrease muscular mechanical work associate increase energy cost decrease muscular efficiency scoliosis population compare healthy control . Furthermore , scoliosis patient exert 30 % physical effort healthy subject ensure habitual locomotion , additional effort require reciprocal increase oxygen consumption . This altered gait pattern demonstrate subject scoliosis may due change global postural control strategy cause spinal deformity . Previous research show scoliosis patient impaired postural balance compare healthy control , several others find effect scoliosis postural balance . This discrepancy finding may due difference curve characteristic include effect postural balance , curve type ( single double ) , number different curve type , location curve ( thoracic lumbar ) , and/or Cobb angle . Furthermore , Schimmel et al . found postural balance one year surgery improve result well spinal alignment , neither reduced range trunk motion inherent fusion negatively affect postural balance . While medicinal intervention may assist associated co-morbid condition , surgical intervention may indicate patient intractable debilitate low back leg pain . These surgery prove extremely successful majority patient . The surgery may involve decompression instrumentation stabilize spine achieve arthrodesis . Surgical intervention may provide pain relief improvement function one area significant clinical interest restoration/improvement gait functional balance . Based investigator knowledge , limited literature biomechanics neuromuscular control low extremity spine assess objective gait analysis balance strategy adult degenerative scoliosis patient , pre post surgical intervention . The purpose study determine impact spinal deformity biomechanics neuromuscular control lower upper extremity , also investigate impact surgery function evaluate gait balance analysis use dynamic Electromyograph ( EMG ) , video motion capture force plate analysis also compare patient healthy control well evaluate extent limitation surgery .</detailed_description>
