	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma ( mPRCC ) treat sunitinib malate ( sunitinib ) PFS patient mPRCC treat MET kinase inhibitor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) response rate ( RR ; define combined rate confirm unconfirmed partial response [ PR ] complete response [ CR ] ) patient mPRCC treat sunitinib RR patient treat putative MET inhibitor . II . To compare overall survival ( OS ) patient mPRCC treat sunitinib OS patient mPRCC treat putative MET inhibitor . III . To compare safety profile sunitinib putative MET inhibitor patient mPRCC . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate prognostic predictive value MET mutation , MET copy number marker MET signal patient mPRCC treat putative MET inhibitor . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive sunitinib malate orally ( PO ) day 1-28 . ARM II : Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate PO day 1-42 . ARM III : Patients receive crizotinib PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-42 . ARM IV : Patients receive volitinib PO day 1-42 . In arm , course repeat every 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
