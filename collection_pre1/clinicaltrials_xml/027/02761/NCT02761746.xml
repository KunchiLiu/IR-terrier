	<brief_summary>This study multi-site ( Detroit , MI ; Los Angeles , CA ; Philadelphia , PA , Washington , DC ) , two-group randomize controlled trial test two-session intervention design increase motivation adherence antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) among youth live HIV ( YLH ) newly recommend begin medication . Participants randomize receive intervention , Motivational Enhancement System Adherence ( MESA ) , control condition , System Health ( SH : healthy eat physical activity information ) .

	<brief_title>Motivational Enhancement System Adherence ( MESA ) Youth Starting ART</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medication adherence rate among youth live HIV ( YLH ) inadequate effectively manage disease . Very adherence intervention test youth , difficult implement real-world setting due high intensity session low attendance rate . Thus , demand innovative , feasible , engage behavioral intervention target adherence , especially among YLH , large initiator antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) . A universal primary prevention program novel approach target adherence problem begin provide prevention intervention youth newly initiate ART . This study plan test brief , two-session , computer-delivered motivational intervention prevent adherence difficulty among youth newly prescribe ART . All element study ( assessment , intervention , control condition ) pilot small multi-site randomize control trial ( NIH-funded Adolescent Medicine Trials Medicine Network HIV/AIDS Interventions : ATN ) . Results suggest feasibility acceptability , well trend improved adherence compare intervention active control condition . For propose multi-site randomized clinical trial , youth newly begin ART ( N=300 4 ATN site United States ) randomize Motivational Enhancement System Adherence ( MESA ) control condition ( System Health : SH ; nutrition exercise information deliver platform match dose ) . ART adherence ( visual analog scale hair specimen assay ) health outcome ( viral load result CD4 count ) primary outcome . Potential mediator ( HIV knowledge , motivation adherence , self-efficacy adherence ) treatment effect MESA moderator ( substance abuse , mental health symptom , executive functioning , stressful life event ) predictors differential intervention response assess . It hypothesize participant randomized MESA show significantly great adherence health outcome participant randomize SH one year follow-up .</detailed_description>
