	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To determine effect neoGAA ( GZ402666 ) treatment respiratory muscle strength measure percent predict forced vital capacity ( % FVC ) upright position , compare alglucosidase alfa . Secondary Objective : To determine safety effect neoGAA treatment functional endurance ( 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) , inspiratory muscle strength ( maximum inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) ) , expiratory muscle strength ( maximum expiratory pressure ( MEP ) ) , low extremity muscle strength ( hand-held dynamometry ( HHD ) ) , motor function ( Quick Motor Function Test ( QMFT ) ) , health-related quality life ( SF-12 ) .</brief_summary>

The patient must provide sign , inform consent prior perform study related procedure . Consent legally authorize guardian ( ) ( ) require legally minor patient define local regulation . If patient legally minor , sign write consent shall obtain parent ( ) /legal guardian assent obtain patient , applicable . The patient ( patient 's legal guardian patient legally minor define local regulation ) must ability comply clinical protocol . The patient , female childbearing potential , must negative pregnancy test ( betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ) baseline . Exclusion criterion : The patient &lt; 3 year age . The patient know Pompe specific cardiac hypertrophy . The patient wheelchair dependent . The patient able ambulate 40 meter ( approximately 130 foot ) without stop without assistive device . The patient require invasiveventilation ( noninvasive ventilation allow ) . The patient able successfully perform repeat forced vital capacity ( FVC ) measurement upright position ≥30 % predict ≤85 % predict . The patient previous treatment alglucosidase alfa investigational therapy Pompe disease . The patient prior current use immune tolerance induction therapy The information intend contain consideration relevant patient 's potential participation clinical trial .</criteria>
