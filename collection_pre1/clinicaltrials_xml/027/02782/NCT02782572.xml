	<brief_title>Safety Aerobic Exercise Acute Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subject perform individualized clinical evaluation right hospital admission day 1 ( D1 ) cardiologist physiotherapis involve study . Pulmonary function test ( spirometry ) , blood sample ( brain natriuretic peptide [ NT-proBNP ] high sensitive C-reactive protein [ hs-CRP ] ) , six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) , maximal inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) test perform . After clinical test perform , patient randomize three group , receive standard medical treatment . The control group ( CTL ) receive medical treatment perform aerobic exercise training ; ET+NIV group perform aerobic exercise training associate NIV day , 8 consecutive day ; ET+Sham group perform aerobic exercise placebo NIV day , 8 consecutive day . The ET+NIV ET+Sham group also receive medical treatment . After eight consecutive day , patient underwent new clinical evaluation ( D10 ) . After D10 , patient continue receive conventional treatment , follow main outcome ( hospital discharge , worsen HF , death ) . Worsening HF consider patient need transfer intensive care unit .</detailed_description>
