	<brief_summary>Antibiotic dependent pouchitis ( ADP ) predestine benefit FMT , since bacterial dysbiosis , control antibiotic , appear major driver clinical symptom . This proof concept randomize placebo control trial , 50 % patient receive FMT 50 % receive placebo FMT . Additionally trial offer open label extension period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>FMT ADP promise approach , give documented role bacteria pathogenesis . In contrast patient C. difficile colitis , single FMT highly effective , patient Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) intensify therapy daily repeat FMT may beneficial . Whereas repeat endoscopic application feasible repeat enema application favor patient combination endoscopic FMT consecutive maintenance therapy oral FMT use FMT capsule G3 produce OpenBiome help establish donor microbiome host seem promising approach . The objective trial evaluate safety FMT patient ADP estimate effect size achieve FMT therapy patient ADP subsequent evaluation large definitive trial . A secondary objective study microbial engraftment donor FMT recipient . This proof concept randomize placebo control trial open label extension period evaluate safety efficacy initial endoscopic FMT follow 14 day oral FMT . The study two distinct outcome , clinical translational aim , investigate effect FMT patient ADP . Aim1 : Evaluation safety , tolerability clinical effectiveness ( measured clinical response remission discontinuation antibiotic therapy ) FMT patient ADP . Aim 2 : Evaluation impact FMT fecal bacterial microbiome patient ADP , provide functional data possible mechanisms therapy .</detailed_description>
