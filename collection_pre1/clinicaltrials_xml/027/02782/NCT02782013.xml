	<detailed_description>Pneumonia common infectious disease lung , often require treatment hospital . Clinical score system available , identify patient require hospitalization . However , course disease patient hospital remain hard predict . While patient recover quickly , , despite appropriate treatment , develop severe course lead sepsis systemic response result organ dysfunction . The PROGRESS study aim identify clinical , genetic molecular marker combination thereof predict severe course pneumonia hospital . Such predictor , instance , support decision earlier transfer patient intensive care thus improve outcome . The PROGRESS study initially approve ethic board University Hospital Jena , Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena , Germany ( 2403-10/08 , November 6th , 2008 ) subsequently ethic committee recruit study center . In observational , longitudinal case-cohort study , patient enrol within 48 hour hospitalization patient 's progress follow much detail six day thereafter . Further data collect discharge hospital . Patients follow day 28 , 180 , 360 enrollment . Baseline assessment comprise sociodemographic , anamnestic , family history , live style information . Upon enrollment , Pneumonia Severity Index ( PSI ) CURB-65 determine . For day enrollment six subsequent study day routine laboratory clinical observation information therapy document well data determine Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score , Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ( SIRS ) status , organ dysfunction . Starting enrollment , six consecutive set biomaterials collect comprise serum , plasma , material extraction RNA . Blood extraction DNA collect . Follow comprise vital status , housing situation , recurrence pneumonia , quality life questionnaire . Analysis cross sectional time series data identify clinical , genetic , molecular marker predict severe course pneumonia hospital . Analysis multilevel 'omics data conjunction clinical data provide new insight pathomechanistic detail pneumonia progression .</detailed_description>
