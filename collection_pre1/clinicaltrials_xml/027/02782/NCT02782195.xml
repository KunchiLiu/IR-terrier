	<brief_summary>Eight adolescent young adult subject type 1 diabetes , age 16−24 year , recruit study basis inform consent . Participants invite attend Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility Addenbrooke 's Hospital , Cambridge , two occasion . On occasion participant arrive unit 9am control diabetes short act insulin 24 hour remain unit 8am next morning . During day , 9am 6pm participant remain fasting blood glucose level control intravenous insulin , dose determine 15−30 minute blood glucose estimation . At 1800hr visit 1 subject ask ingest even meal enrich cold isotope glucose tracer ( non radioactive ) . The variable insulin infusion adjust allow meal order achieve good glycaemic control meal 0200hr . From 0800hr morning study team adjust infusion rate maintain normal glycemia participant ready go home normal insulin regimen . On second visit protocol identical 1800hr instead give meal variable amount glucose infused ensure glucose level identical observe visit 1 . After 0200hr study effectively finish study team continue vary insulin infusion keep blood glucose level normal subject go home normal insulin regime 8am . In order achieve sufficient information make calculation need cold isotope glucose tracer infuse study period . These safe non radioactive isotope tracer enable u assess glucose produce body , distribution utilization . Throughout study period subject monitor closely Clinical Research Fellow , assist Research Nurse , order avoid risk low blood glucose level .</brief_summary>
