	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia ( SZ ) chronic , severe disease result misperception reality , major social withdrawal cognitive disturbance . Executive dysfunction widely consider primary determinant functional outcome . However , classic neuropsychological executive function measure poorly represent patient ' functional outcome seem inappropriate evaluate real-world functional impact disease . In perspective , Shallice Burgess develop brain-damaged patient , Multiple Errands Test ( MET ) allow assess planning , adaptation , problem solve mental flexibility real life setting , thus well capture day-to-day ability include contextual ( social , perceptive ) influence . Setting assessment outside laboratory help identify subtle executive impairment systematically express standard care condition consequently improve future care solution . MET base Supervisory Attentional System ( SAS ) model executive function attention control specifies think action schema become activated suppressed routine non-routine circumstance . MET designed measure real-world executive performance confront participant unpredictable affordances interpersonal interaction plan problem solve . Patients ask accomplish several task variable complexity unknown commercial district . A number rule must respect thus action plan , strategy formulation , time space management little assistance examiner require . Most study involve MET conceive patient acquire brain damage . LeThiec offer extensive protocol initial scoring system ( term inefficiency , rule break , interpretation failure task execution failure ) . Simplified version MET also suggest suitable hospital setting . Only one study do SZ include single patient , therefore difficult draw conclusion clinical utility SZ . To date , study investigate suitability MET patient psychosis , executive impairment well document population The investigator hypothesize Multiple Errands Test ( MET ) , ecological assessment executive function well ability measure everyday adaptative functioning SZ , compare conventional EF assessment method . The objective study : ( 1 ) establish normative data ( 2 ) study discriminant validity tool large panel EF measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods : 60 clinically stable SZ patient 60 control administer MET , well two measure executive function : Wisconsin Card Sorting Test - 64 , 6 Elements Test . Functional outcome assess Behavioural Inventory Executive Functioning ( BRIEF-A ) , ECHELLES LAUSANNOISES D'AUTO-EVALUATION DES DIFFICULTES ET DES BESOINS ( ELADEB scale ) Global Assessment Functioning scale ( GAF scale ) . Clinical measure record patient ( Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale ( PANSS ) , State Trait Anxiety Inventory - Y ( STAI-Y A ) , Diagnostic Interview Genetic Studies ( DIGS ) Family Interview Genetic Studies ( FIGS ) ) . Step1 : The investigator first compare patient control variable MET establish normative data . Step 2 : The investigator study discriminant validity MET . The investigator compare MET traditional measure executive functioning . The investigator assess correlation executive measure functional outcome .</detailed_description>
