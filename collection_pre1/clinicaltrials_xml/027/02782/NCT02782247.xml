	<brief_summary>Chronic viral hepatitis often lead liver scar - cirrhosis . If virus eradicate liver , liver scar liver function often recover . In patient damage severe recovery take place . It yet know patient liver disease advance benefit therapy know fast recovery occurs . Non-intrusive dynamic liver testing ( DLT ) may allow u predict functionality liver post treatment may guide u treatment choice - example patient predict recover may prioritise transplantation . Indocyanine green ( ICG ) dye solely excrete liver bile use measure dynamic function . Transient elastography similar ultrasound measure degree fibrosis within liver . The investigator hypothesise use non-intrusive dynamic liver test pre-treatment , allow u delineate patient therapy functional liver recovery follow viral eradication . The investigator hypothesise monitoring change liver fibrosis liver function patient historical viral clearance allow assessment likely speed recovery liver fibrosis function - example patient 5 year treatment viral hepatitis induce cirrhosis 'normal ' fibrosis liver function score investigator able conclude recovery complete within 5 year . The investigator perform study pre post-treatment assess liver function use non-intrusive dynamic liver test addition currently-used 'liver function ' score system , multivariate analysis , determine whether investigator identify patient functional liver recovery post therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple disease affect liver 's performance , include hepatitis ' B C virus . Hepatitis infect liver ; ultimately lead cirrhosis associate complication ( e.g . bleed death ) , term decompensated cirrhosis . Hepatitis induce decompensated liver disease likely improve upon eradication virus liver function . Recently , Hepatitis C see new , efficacious therapy , allow functional outcome evaluate follow viral clearance . It show treatment regime effective eliminate virus 70 % patient functional improvement 40 % rest stagnate become worse . These patient may benefit liver transplantation initially , follow viral eradication therapy . Treatment Hepatitis B virus stop copy produce within cell . This part successful liver recovers . However , 5 year treatment 26 % people recover sufficiently ability identify early important future management . Non-intrusive dynamic liver testing ( DLT ) may allow u predict functionality liver post treatment may guide u adequate management strategy . Indocyanine green ( ICG ) dye solely excrete liver bile use measure dynamic function . Transient elastography similar ultrasound measure degree fibrosis within liver . The investigator hypothesise use non-intrusive dynamic liver test pre-treatment , allow u delineate patient early , would benefit intensive treatment ( e.g . transplant ) , spare less severe disease risk potential side effect . The investigator perform study pre post-treatment DLT . These amalgamate currently-used score system , multivariate analysis , ascertain value thus best-treatment option patient .</detailed_description>
