	<detailed_description>Fluid resuscitation effective treatment shock . Isotonic crystalloid solution current recommend initial fluid resuscitation . However , kind fluid high volume distribution may require large volume administration achieve therapeutic goal shock reversal . There rise concern delay shock reversal adverse consequence large amount volume fluid therapy . Colloid fluid use alternate fluid resuscitation , aim limit volume fluid resuscitation promote shock reversal . Data recent randomize control study show improve long term survival among shock patient whose resuscitated colloid solution . There evidence increase incidence acute kidney injury among critically ill patient receive hydroxyethyl starch , previously worldwide use colloid solution . For septic shock , lead cause shock current situation , resuscitation albumin may associate good outcome , increase mortality report among patient receive hydroxyethyl starch . Whether colloid infusion improve shock reversal rate decrease complication associate fluid resuscitation , inconclusive information .</detailed_description>
