	<brief_summary>This standard phase 2 study power demonstrate improvement 100 day leukemia free survival 30 % &lt; 10 % expect use reduce intensity haplo-HCT extremely high-risk patient cohort ( base institutional experience use non-myeloablative / reduce intensity condition similar patient cohort ) . A formal safety evaluation do every 6th patient enrol trial stop note unusually high engraftment failure ( acute GVHD rate ( &gt; 60 % grade &gt; 30 % grade III/IV ≥ 50 % severe cGVHD ) engraftment failure rate ( ≥15 % ) .</brief_summary>
