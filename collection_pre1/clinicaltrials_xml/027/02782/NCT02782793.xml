	<brief_title>Predictors Unsuccessful Endoscopic Mucosal Resection Complex Colon Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colon cancer third lead cause cancer-related death United States . The number death significantly decrease due screen colonoscopy . A colonoscopy procedure physician examines rectum large intestine abnormality use specialize camera call endoscope . Colonoscopies decrease mortality associate colon cancer two main way : detect remove pre-cancerous lesion call polyp ; detect colon cancer earlier stage , therapy still effective treat remove cancer . Most colon polyp small completely remove standard colonoscopy . However , grow awareness amongst endoscopists polyps large inaccessible safely remove routine colonoscopy . Previously , lesion require surgery removal affect part colon . There grow body evidence suggest complex colon polyp entirely remove endoscopically procedure call endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) , thereby avoid costly debilitate surgery . Given novel procedure , available specialize care center . EMR procedure identical colonoscopy , step involve lift removal complex polyp . As many 80-90 % complex polyp successfully remove EMR . However , note removal polyp piece , rather whole result 20-30 % recurrence rate resection site . Any manipulation polyp prior EMR may impair ability fully remove lesion . Some factor previously suggest increase difficulty EMR include previous dye injection , removal attempt , polyp sampling . However , true impact previous manipulation CCPs remain unclear . This study aim one large prospective , multi-centered study investigate factor predict failure EMR removal complex colon polyp .</detailed_description>
