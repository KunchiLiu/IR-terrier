	<brief_title>A Study Pevonedistat Adult East Asian Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call Pevonedistat . Pevonedistat test treat people myelodysplastic syndrome MDS ( include nonproliferative chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [ CMML ] ) AML ( acute myeloid leukaemia ) single-agent combination treatment azacitidine . This study look safety tolerability , recommend phase 2/phase 3 dose pevonedistat administer combination azacitidine , pharmacokinetics response treatment participant take single agent pevonedistat compare participant take pevonedistat azacitidine . The study enroll approximately 37 participant . Participants assign one four treatment group remain disclosed patient study doctor study . Participants first enrol single-agent low dose level ( 25 mg/m^2 ) . If dose tolerable , participant enrol parallel single-agent high dose level ( 44 mg/m^2 ) combination treatment cohort . - Pevonedistat 25 mg/m^2 - Pevonedistat 44 mg/m^2 - Pevonedistat 10 mg/m^2 azacitidine 75 mg/m^2 combination - Pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 azacitidine 75 mg/m^2 combination Participants receive pevonedistat infusion intravenously azacitidine via intravenous subcutaneous route . This multi-center trial conduct Japan , Korea Taiwan . The overall time participate study approximately 24 month . Participants attend End Study ( EOS ) visit safety , 30 day receive last dose study drug start subsequent antineoplastic therapy ( hydroxyurea ) .</detailed_description>
