	<brief_summary>Growth hormone ( GH ) essential longitudinal bone growth somatic development . These protein anabolic effect require sufficient nutritional supply . During fast caloric restriction GH predominantly promote fat metabolism . GH counteract effect insulin many tissue , insulin-stimulated glucose uptake skeletal muscle extensively study . Substrate competition elevate free fatty acid glucose suggest mechanism , hypothesis test mechanistically mean acipimox , nicotinic acid suppresses fat metabolize effect GH . The hypothesis , suppressive effect GH insulin-stimulated glucose uptake skeletal muscle obviate acipimox-induced inhibition fat metabolism . In order investigate , eight adult hypopituitary patient document GH-deficiency study presence absence GH acipimox , respectively , biopsy skeletal muscle subcutaneous adipose tissue analyze . Knowledge effect growth hormone fat metabolism shot-sight well long-sight great importance understand growth disorder overweight type 2 diabetes malnutrition eat disorder .</brief_summary>
