	<brief_summary>Background : The gas mask use protect military non-military subject expose respiratory hazard ( CBRN agent ) . The aim study evaluate impact gas mask respiratory pattern indexes respiratory effort . Methods : We complete study 14 healthy subject evaluate breathing pattern , index respiratory effort blood gas . Seven condition test randomized order : rest , effort ( tread mill , standardize 7 METs subject ) induce hypoxemia without mask ( C4 , Airboss Defence , Bromont , Canada ) . Airway pressure , inspiratory expiratory flow measure . An esophageal catheter introduce begin study measure esophageal pressure ( Peso ) calculate index respiratory effort ( PTPeso , WOB ) . SpO2 continuously measure capillary blood base draw end condition . Each condition last 10 minute , data last 2 minute steady state consider analysis . Results : The preliminary analysis base 10 subject present . Comparing wear gas mask without , respiratory index increase test condition ( rest , induce hypoxemia effort ) . At rest , 8 10 healthy subject index effort high gas mask , statistical trend observe WOB ( 0.22±0.13 vs. 0.28±0.10 J/cycle ; p = 0.059 ) , PTPes ( 101±35 vs. 122±47 cmH2O*s ; p=0.21 ) SwingPeso ( 4.4±2.0 vs. 5.3±2.0 cmH2O ; p=0.13 ) . During effort , respiratory index increase ( WOB 4.0±2.6 vs. 5.6±3.2 ; p=0.10 ; PTPeso 406±211 vs. 606±65 ; p=0.04 ; SwingPeso 14.8±8.1 vs. 21.8±9.0 ; p=0.13 ) . There difference breathing pattern arterial blood gas data without mask . Data induce hypoxemia analysis . We measure bench inspiratory expiratory resistance test gas mask ( C4 : inspiratory resistance = 3.2 cmH2O 1 L/sec ; expiratory resistance = 0.9 cmH2O 1 L/sec ) . This may explain part increase work breathe mask . Conclusions : This study demonstrate increase index respiratory effort exercise gas mask . This study first directly assess index effort esophageal pressure situation . Our result method may use reference evaluate tolerance different design gas mask .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Gas Mask : Effects Respiration !</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal way penetration CBRNE agent respiratory system . The current technology gas mask use protect respiratory system far back First World War . That originate Dr Cluny Macpherson 's initiative Canadian military physician . The military gas mask part respirator classification owe specific feature . Conventionally , military gas mask cover large spectrum protection aspect match specific canister . Consequently , gas mask usually study separately respirator Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus ( SBCA ) . The gas mask design component may lead respiratory load issue . At rest effort , would impact work breathe gas exchange ? In order avoid hypoxemia hyperoxia , would optimal mean restore proper oxygenation ? We hypothesise : i. heighten WOB respiratory demand related wear gas mask ; ii . An occurrence hypoxemia manifest continuous period rest effort . Our goal measure impact work breathe gas exchange gas mask user . We also measure optimal mean correct hypoxemia subject . 14 Male Human Subjects participate comparison single-blind randomize experimental study . That approve Ethical Review Committee . All male subject average age 38.9±5 year old FEV1 4.60±0.70 Liter . A write consent obtain subject prior acceptance . No rejection happen recruiting . The eligibility criterion : . No significant cardiac respiratory disease know ; ii . No epilepsy background ; iii . No severe pathology require medication ; iv . No pregnancy woman ; v. Face medium - size relation gas mask . The exclusion criterion : i. Refusals relate wear oesophageal catheter capillary puncture ; ii . Claustrophobia ; iii . Oesophageal wound background ; iv . No coronary background stroke history ; v. No face morphology incompatibility mask . Spirometry usual health screening also do start clinical trial . Design comprise seven 10-minute test condition split two part . Five rest sit chair : i. Baseline without gas mask ; ii . Baseline gas mask ; iii . Hypoxemia without mask ; iv . Hypoxemia gas mask ; v. Hypoxemia correct . Two effort condition program 7 METS Effort Zone perform Treadmill ( Constant 3 MPH speed 10 % inclination ) . These without gas mask . Between rest-condition 5-minute wash-out take place effort ten-minute apply . Three five-minute period follow record blood pressure pulse condition . SpO2 continuously measure Free O2 condition Massimo employ also begin inclusion three hypoxemia condition ( Radical - Signal Extraction Pulse Oximeter ) . During effort , take two-minute , start zero start point . Capillary puncture do end condition . Our main measurement WOB perform continuous record Peso pressure respiratory volume . Software Acknowledge , version 3.9 serve acquisition data system analysis achieve 4.2 version free-trial WOB calculus system , name RESPMAT . That obtain Maynaud al . [ 2 ] . As power source , use BIOPAC ( MP100 , Santa Barbara , Californie , USA , 200 Hertz ) , four differential sensor ( Validyne : 1x MP45±100 cmH2O ; 2x MP ? ? ±5 cmH2O ; 1x MP100±100 cmH2O ) four Carrier D-Modulators ( Validyne , CT-15,120 Volt , 60 Hertz , 5Watts , Model CD15-A-2-A-1 ) . Single esophageal catheter ( Type Cooper , French caliber # 5 ) disposable pneumotachs use . Lidocain spray K-Y gel apply insertion catheter . Its placement do 37.6±5.7 cm across subject Mueller test perform subject . In regard spontaneous breathing , Hudson mask use C-4 Gas Mask canister employ ( Manufacturer : Airboss Defence , Bromont , Canada ) . Hypoxemia mixture home-design usual nitrous medical gas maintain FiO2 target 14 % . Prototyped Free O2 System employ correction hypoxemia .</detailed_description>
