	<brief_summary>Atypical carious cavity could define carious lesion 2 surface tooth . Dental practitioner show difficulty relate material 's maintenance type cavity therefore , several treatment option use . However , show great failure percentage . A randomized clinical trial develop objective assess Hall technique comparison composite resin incremental technique 464 primary molar ' atypical carious lesion child 4 9 year old . Initially , two previously calibrate examiner perform caries diagnosis mean visual assessment intraoral examination . Selected teeth randomly allocate two group . Teeth first group submit prefabricated stainless steel crown treatment ( Hall technique ) ; , composite resin incremental technique , always place rubber dam isolation . Lesions ' clinical radiographic follow-up conduct 6 12 month . Treatment 's efficacy assess mean four main outcome : 1 . Longevity , marginal adaptation , possible modification patient ' vertical dimension , caries lesion progression ; 2 . Patient-focused criterion ( satisfaction , discomfort quality life impact ) ; 3. cost-efficacy ; 4 . Treatment-related parent ' , child ' operator ' perception . Other variable could analyse secondary outcome , technique perform time among operator , impact socio-economic characteristic restoration ' longevity , restoration ' type impact antagonist tooth . Comparisons group address use Kaplan-Meier survival test well Long-Rank test . Cox Regression use enable assessment variable ' influence result . Significance value 5 % adopt analysis .</brief_summary>
