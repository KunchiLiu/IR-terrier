	<brief_summary>CMV lesion find olfactory system child congenital CMV infection study hitherto examine impact congenital CMV infection olfaction . So investigator propose study ass proportion child olfactory deficit among child congenital CMV infection . Second study also evaluate performance new olfactory test , base discrimination binary odorant mixture .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assesment Olfactory Disorders Performance New Olfactory Test Children With Congenital CMV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) first cause congenital deafness result viral infection . Hearing loss may occur several year birth childhood often progressive . Detection hear impairment major interest child allow early use hearing aid minimize impact deficit cognitive development . The study hypothesis link might exist hear deficit olfactory deficit child due viral lesion two sensory system . Thus early exploration olfaction might allow early detection start deterioration hear predict occurrence deafness . Moreover , exploration easy , non invasive , fast set adapt young child . No study hitherto assessed impact congenital CMV infection olfaction . The proportion child olfactory deficit assess among child congenital CMV infection , use part discrimination test simple odorants ( Sniffin ' Sticks , Burghardt , Wedel , Germany ) . The performance new olfactory test develop investigator use binary mixture odorants , also assess . These test nasal chemosensory performance base pen-like odor dispense device measure odor discrimination ability young child le 15 min . Finally , study aim demonstrate , exist , association olfactory deficit hear loss child congenital CMV infection . This study conduct 80 patient 40 healthy subject ( 3-10years ) . The healthy child match age gender . Selection make base medical record course standard care visit . After collection inform consent , olfactory test perform .</detailed_description>
