	<brief_title>Validation Hospital Asthma Severity Score ( HASS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children age 7-18 year HASS score obtain single provider . After score complete , pulmonary technician perform spirometry test . Children age 2 6 year old concurrently ( separately ) asthma severity grade 2 individual measurer use HASS tool PRAM tool . If consent perform spirometry , test perform tool ( ) score obtain . The spirometry test interpret board-certified pediatric pulmonologist . Descriptive statistic use preliminary analysis describe sample characteristic , outlier , representativeness data . Primary Aim 1 . To describe inter-rater reliability HASS score 2 individual health care provider Data Analysis 1 . Use overall percentage agreement , weight unweighted kappa intraclass correlation coefficient show inter-rater reliability HASS tool . For measure , percent agreement raters Cohen 's kappa statistic ( rater agreement adjust chance agreement ) report . Primary Aim 2 . To evaluate construct validity HASS tool cohort patient ' age 7 to18 year old compare forced expiratory volume spirometry Data Analysis 2 . Treating outcomes continuous , correlation coefficient compute HASS % Forced Expiratory Volume 1 . Sub-analyses also perform age group % Forced Expiratory Volume1 severity level see whether correlation HASS % Forced Expiratory Volume1 consistent across age asthma severity stratum . Treating outcomes categorical , HASS % Forced Expiratory Volume1 categorize three level ( mild , moderate , severe ) , investigator could classify nine cell 3 3 table ( HASS X % Forced Expiratory Volume1 ) either : 1. concordant ( three cell ; complete agreement : test say 'Severe ' , instance ) , 2. discordant ( four cell ; e.g . one test say Moderate say Mild ) 3. grossly discordant ( two cell ; one test say Severe say Mild ) . For Receiver Operating Curve analysis , Forced Expiratory Volume dichotomize Severe ( % Forced Expiratory Volume1 &lt; 60 % predict ) versus Less Severe ( % Forced Expiratory Volume1â‰¥60 % predict ) . In analyze data , correlation ( continuous ) , 3 3 table ( categorical ) , Receiver Operating Curve ( dichotomous % Forced Expiratory Volume1 ) treatment present , continuous result consider primary . A high level agreement expect HASS spirometry severity score make case HASS use place % Forced Expiratory Volume1 test . Secondary Aim 3 . To evaluate construct validity HASS tool cohort patient ' age 2 6 year old compare forced expiratory volume spirometry . Data Analysis 3 . Treating outcomes continuous , correlation coefficient compute HASS % Forced Expiratory Volume1 . Treating outcomes categorical , HASS % Forced Expiratory Volume1 categorize three level ( mild , moderate , severe ) , investigator could classify nine cell 3 3 table ( HASS X % Forced Expiratory Volume1 ) concordant , discordant grossly discordant ( describe Data Analysis 2 ) . An adequate level observe agreement would 80 % observation agreement cell , 18 % discordant , 2 % grossly discordant cell . In analyze data , correlation ( continuous ) 3 3 table ( categorical ) treatment present , continuous result consider primary . A high level agreement expect HASS spirometry severity score make case HASS use place spirometry . Secondary Aim 4 . To evaluate construct validity HASS tool cohort patient ' age 2 6 year old compare Preschool Respiratory Assessment Measure ( PRAM ) Data Analysis 4 . Treating outcomes continuous , correlation coefficient compute HASS PRAM . If HASS PRAM categorize three level ( mild , moderate , severe ) , investigator could classify nine cell 3 3 table ( HASS X PRAM ) either concordant , discordant , grossly discordant ( describe Data Analysis 2 ) . An adequate level observe agreement would 80 % observation agreement cell , 18 % discordant , 2 % grossly discordant cell .</detailed_description>
