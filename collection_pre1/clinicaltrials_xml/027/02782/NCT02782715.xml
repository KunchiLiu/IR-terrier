	<brief_summary>The specific aim study : 1 . To determine safety feasibility treat patient combination MRI guide stereotactic body radiation therapy microwave ablation . 2 . To assess short long-term toxicity rate patient treat combined modality approach . 3 . To assess local control , survival , pathologic response treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PII SBRT + Microwave Ablation Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Renal cell carcinoma traditionally manage via surgical approach . Increasingly , local therapy radiofrequency microwave ablation utilized alternative patient may tolerate nephrectomy refuse one . Although local control rate small lesion excellent , drop precipitously lesions 4 cm . Furthermore , lesions critical area renal hilum may difficult treat method . Stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) long record treating patient inoperable tumor location lung central nervous system , increase evidence may useful patient renal cell carcinoma . The recent emergence MRI-guided radiation therapy allow direct visualization tumor treatment , may potentially allow clinician treat tumor precisely . This phase I study treat renal cell carcinoma patient use combination MRI-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy microwave ablation .</detailed_description>
