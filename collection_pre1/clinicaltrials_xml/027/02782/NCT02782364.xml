	<brief_summary>Anal Acoustic Reflectometry ( AAR ) technique study department last 6 year . Sound wave pas balloon place anal canal use measure cross-sectional area . By gradually increase decrease pressure balloon investigator measure pressure cross-sectional area start increase decrease , anal canal start open close . This assessment mimic natural open closing anal canal effect squeeze muscle . The gold standard investigation anal sphincter muscle manometry measure anal canal pressure rest squeeze . However , limitation . Despite two measurement within normal range , patient significant faecal incontinence . This prompt clinician search good investigation guide management condition . AAR reproducible repeatable technique use research technique assessment faecal incontinence . It show correlate symptom severity , unlike manometry , able distinguish different symptomatic subgroup faceal incontinence . In study far investigator increase bag inflation pressure step time mean study take 20 minute perform . The limitation method measurement squeeze pressure sphincter muscle subject fatigue . A recent study use acoustic technique urethra demonstrate faster method record measurement 8 minute period . The investigator propose study fatiguability effect faster technique validate method exist step-wise technique standard anal manometry . Patients randomise two group : 1 . Stepwise fast-fill 2 . Fast-fill stepwise</brief_summary>
