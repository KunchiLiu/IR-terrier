	<brief_summary>Hailey Hailey Darier disease rare genetic dermatosis . Mutations 2 gene ( ATP2C1 ATP2A2 respectively ) responsible disease . These gene key role calcium pump ; defect create abnormal link keratinocytes ' desmosomes induce skin lesion . Clinically , patient present inflammatory lesion locate fold . Quality life impair pain , pruritus tendency infection . Lesions permanent acute exacerbation occur hot season increase sweat . Usual therapy often effective ( local treatment , laser , phototherapy ) . Because sweat well establish induce aggravate factor , botulism toxin could effective treatment disease . Botulism toxin already use clinical practice act via decreased sweet secretion . Improvement skin lesion Hailey-Hailey Darier diseases previously report case study properly evaluate benefit treatment . The aim project study improvement quality life patient suffer Hailey-Hailey Darier diseases injection botulism toxin large skin fold . The principal objective estimate distribution variation quality life M1 vs. baseline .</brief_summary>
