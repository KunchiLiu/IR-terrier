	<brief_summary>Objectives : Primary : Chronic Phase Cohort : To assess rate major cytogenetic response ( MCyR ) alternate schedule axitinib bosutinib patient chronic myeloid leukemia , chronic phase ( CML-CP ) failure of/intolerance &gt; /= 3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) use standard response criterion . Advanced Phase Cohort - Phase I Portion : To determine recommended phase II dose ( RPTDs ) axitinib bosutinib combination patient CML accelerate phase ( CML-AP ) blast phase ( CML-BP ) . ( AP patient must receive &gt; 1 prior TKI ) . Advanced Phase Cohort - Phase II Portion : To evaluate rate major hematologic response ( MaHR ) combine treatment axitinib bosutinib patient CML-AP CML-BP use standard response criterion . ( AP patient must receive &gt; 1 prior TKI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Axitinib Bosutinib Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Chronic , Accelerated Blastic Phases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accelerated Phase Blast Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia : Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , enrol dose level axitinib bosutinib base phase CML join study . Up 8 combination dose level axitinib bosutinib may test . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . If intolerable side effect see , low dose combination axitinib bosutinib may also test . This continue recommend dose axitinib bosutinib find . After recommend dose axitinib bosutinib find , additional participant AP BP CML enrol receive study drug dose . Study Drug Administration : You take bosutinib mouth time day food . You also take axitinib mouth 2 time day , 12 hour apart , without food . You also give study drug diary . You write dose study drug ( ) take , take , miss vomit dos . If miss vomit dose axitinib and/or bosutinib , make dose . You take next schedule dose plan . You bring leftover axitinib and/or bosutinib tablet study drug diary clinic every visit . Study Visits : Every month ( ± 1 week ) first 3 month , every 3 month ( ±1 month ) end first year , every 6 month ( ±1 month ) , physical exam urine collect routine test . If study doctor approves , test perform local doctor . However , must see MD Anderson least every 6 month first year every 12 month . Every week first 3 month , every 2-4 week next 3 month , every 3 month ( ±1 month ) 2 year , every 4-6 month ( ±1 month ) , blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If study doctor approves , may weekly blood draw local lab closer home . The result routine test send study doctor . At end first month ( ±1 week ) end third month ( ±2 week ) , every 3 month ( ±1 month ) end first year , every 6 month ( ±1 month ) end second year , time doctor think need , bone marrow aspiration perform check status disease . This sample also use cytogenetic testing may also use measure level BCR-ABL bone marrow . Every 3 month ( ±1 month ) study : - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw measure level BCR-ABL blood check mutation BCR-ABL protein . - You EKG . You stop EKGs first year . At 3 month start treatment end 1 year treatment , ECHO . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction , study drug longer available . The study doctor discus . Your participation study end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : About 1 month ( ± 5 day ) last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw test mutation BCR-ABL . - You bone marrow aspiration perform cytogenetic test check status disease . This investigational study . Axitinib FDA approve commercially available treatment advance kidney cancer . Bosutinib FDA approve commercially available treatment CML . It consider investigational use axitinib bosutinib combination treat CML . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 52 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson . Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia : Study Drug Administration : You take bosutinib mouth time day food . You also take axitinib mouth 2 time day , 12 hour apart , without food . You switch drug take every 3 month . Some participant may start axitinib switch bosutinib . This mean 3 month take either bosutinib axitinib alone end 3 month , switch drug 3 month . This continue every 3 month study . The study doctor discus dose schedule follow . You also give study drug diary . You write dose study drug ( ) take , take , miss vomit dos . If miss vomit dose axitinib and/or bosutinib , make dose . You take next schedule dose plan . You bring leftover axitinib and/or bosutinib tablet study drug diary clinic every visit . Study Visits : Every 3 month ( ± 1 month ) first year every 6-12 month ( ±1 month ) , physical exam urine collect routine test . If study doctor approves , may test perform local doctor . However , must see MD Anderson least every 6 month ( ±1 month ) first year every 12 month ( ±1 month ) . Every 1-2 week first month , every 4-6 week 1 year start therapy , every 3 month ( ±1 month ) 2 year , every 4-6 month ( ±1 month ) , blood ( 3-4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If study doctor approves , may weekly blood draw local lab closer home . The result routine test send study doctor . Every 3 month ( ± 1 month ) first year , every 4-6 month 3 year start therapy , time doctor think need , bone marrow aspiration perform check status disease . This sample also use cytogenetic testing may also use measure level BCR-ABL bone marrow .
