	<brief_title>Perioperative FOLFIRINOX Patients With Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To evaluate percentage pancreatic cancer patient able complete full 4 month preoperative chemotherapy undergo resection . Secondary Objectives - To assess percentage patient able complete therapy , include preoperative chemotherapy , surgery , postoperative therapy . - To assess treatment-related toxicity preoperative therapy - To assess intra-operative post-operative complication - To assess histopathologic ( R0/R1 ) resection rate preoperative therapy - To determine disease free survival ( DFS ) patient undergo resection . - To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) patient - To determine overall survival ( OS ) date first treatment</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1 . Histologic cytologic diagnosis adenocarcinoma pancreas . 2 . Resectable primary tumor head , body tail pancreas define per NCCN Guidelines version 2.2015 : No extrapancreatic disease , aside lymphadenopathy No arterial tumor contact ( celiac axis , superior mesenteric artery , common hepatic artery ) No tumor contact superior mesenteric vein portal vein ≤ 180° contact without vein contour irregularity 3 . Confirmation resectability surgical oncology consultation . 4 . No previous therapy pancreatic cancer 5 . Short removable metal stent rather plastic stent strongly encourage require palliation initial obstructive jaundice 6 . ECOG performance status 0 1 ( Appendix 1 ) 7 . Age &gt; 18 year 8 . No CVA within 6 month , MI within 6 month 9 . The effect mFOLFIRINOX develop human fetus unknown . For reason chemotherapy agent well therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . 10 . Negative pregnancy test female reproductive age 11 . Anticoagulation permit patient may warfarin . 12 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL total bilirubin &lt; 1.5X upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/ per CockroftGault equation patient creatinine level institutional normal . 13 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Patients previous chemotherapy radiotherapy pancreatic adenocarcinoma prior enter study . 2 . Pathologic subtypes pure adenocarcinoma ; acinar cell carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , spindle cell carcinoma , neuroendocrine cancer , mixed type eligible . 3 . Patients receive investigational agent . 4 . Patients borderline resectable , locally advanced metastatic disease . 5 . History allergic reaction attribute 5FU , leucovorin , irinotecan oxaliplatin compound similar chemical biologic composition . 6 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , active liver disease include viral nonviral hepatitis cirrhosis , chronic diarrhea inflammatory disease colon rectum , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 7 . Pregnant woman exclude study . mFOLFIRINOX regimen contain one chemotherapy agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother mFOLFIRINOX , breastfeed discontinue mother treated agent . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . 8 . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction mFOLFIRINOX . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . 9 . Currently active second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix . Patients consider `` currently active '' malignancy complete therapy evidence recurrence least 5 year . 10 . Preexisting neuropathy great grade 1 . 11 . Inflammatory bowel disease uncontrolled active treatment ( Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis ) .</criteria>
