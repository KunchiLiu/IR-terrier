	<brief_title>Bronchodilator 's Effects Exertional Dyspnoea Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , define mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( mPAP ) ≥25 mmHg rest pulmonary arterial wedge pressure ≤15 mmHg , consistently associate reduced exercise capacity intolerable dyspnoea ( respiratory difficulty ) exertion . Dyspnoea complex multifaceted highly personalized sensory experience , source mechanism incompletely understood . Activity-related dyspnoea appear early frequent complaint patient PAH seek medical attention . This symptom progress relentlessly time lead invariably avoidance activity consequent skeletal muscle deconditioning impoverish quality life . Unfortunately , effective management disable symptom awaits well understand underlying physiology . Previous study mechanisms exertional dyspnoea PAH largely mostly focused cardiovascular determinant respiratory discomfort . However , respiratory mechanic abnormality could contribute exertional dyspnoea patient . For instance , PAH patient may exhibit reduced expiratory flow low lung volume spirometry ( namely instantaneous force expiratory flow measure 50 % 75 % FVC exhale [ FEF50 % FEF75 % ] low predict ) , despite preserve forced expiratory volume 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio ( FEV1/FVC ) . Several study show finding ( `` small airway disease '' ) could common certain PAH cohort , either related incidental description airway wall thicken lymphocytic infiltration PAH propose several speculative explanatory mechanism , either biological mechanical . Whatever cause , reduce expiratory flow low lung volume imply operate tidal volume ( VT ) range become closer normally residual volume ( RV ) mostly increase RV ( elevate residual volume/total lung capacity ratio , RV/TLC ) . The reduced difference force tidal expiratory flow promotes dynamic lung hyperinflation [ i.e. , progressive increase end-expiratory lung volume ( EELV ) ] condition increase ventilatory demand . Dynamic lung hyperinflation ( DH ) increase mechanical inspiratory load respiratory muscle must overcome produce ventilation ( V ' E ) , place diaphragm mechanical disadvantage , reduce ability VT expand appropriately exercise , thus impose `` restrictive '' mechanic : VT therefore truncate increase EELV constrain total lung capacity ( TLC ) envelope relatively reduced inspiratory reserve volume ( IRV ) . Dynamic hyperinflation-induced critical mechanical constraint VT expansion serious sensory consequence , i.e. , increase dyspnoea intensity , clearly show patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease chronic heart failure . In regard , team recently confirm small airway dysfunction spirometry exist majority PAH patient ( 60 % ) despite preserve FEV1/VC , promote development DH increase ventilatory demand response physical task : fact , accelerate ventilatory response exercise , 60 % PAH patient increase EELV ( i.e. , DH ) average 0.50L rest peak exercise , whereas age- sex-matched healthy subject decrease average 0.45L . Similar level DH report healthy subject 40 80 year age , patient mild-to-severe COPD , CHF , recently also heterogeneous group patient precapillary pulmonary hypertension , much low V ' E work-rate homogeneous group PAH patient . Our team also show DH serious sensory consequence PAH patient . DH impose severe mechanical constraint VT expansion exercise background progressively increase central neural drive : VT truncate increase EELV constrain TLC envelope relatively reduced IRV . It generally accept set dyspnoea result conscious awareness increase disparity respiratory effort ( neural drive breathe ) simultaneous thoracic volume displacement . The notion DH subsequent constraint VT expansion contribute exertional dyspnoea bolster strong inverse correlation dyspnoea intensity increase dynamic EELV/TLC ( % ) ( R=0.70 , p &lt; 0.05 ) reduce IRV/TLC ( % ) ( R=-0.78 , p &lt; 0.05 ) standardize exercise stimulus . Our team able , first time , clearly demonstrate abnormal mechanic breathe ( dynamic lung hyperinflation attendant constraint VT expansion ) play important role dyspnoea causation PAH cycle exercise . When increased ventilation/perfusion mismatch superimpose pre-existing abnormal airway function , great troublesome exertional symptom result . This finding open new horizon research field dyspnoea mechanisms PAH : investigator treat ameliorate `` lung function '' ( i.e. , respiratory mechanic abnormality '' ) , team could able improve troublesome exertional symptom curtail daily-living activity PAH patient . The corollary therapeutic intervention effectively reduce and/or delay rate onset DH-induced critical ventilatory constraint , administration inhale bronchodilator ( BDs ) add-on vasodilator , positive effect symptom perception select patient stable PAH . Determining magnitude effect object plan experiment . However , borne mind relationship dyspnoea intensity severity respiratory abnormality linear , rather exponential . In word , give disease already responsible intense dyspnoea , small additional deterioration directly indirectly related disease make dyspnoea intolerable . Therefore , even small BDs-induced change respiratory mechanic could major effect dyspnoea intensity exertion select PAH patient , would undoubtedly major impact quality life ability perform daily-living activity . Hypothesis research What potential mechanism BDs would able ameliorate exertional symptom patient stable PAH , , BDs would best candidate achieve ? Regardless BDs administer , team anticipate potential mechanism BDs able ameliorate exertional symptom patient stable PAH would reduction and/or delay rate onset DH-induced critical ventilatory constraint exercise . In contrast , nature specific BD ( β2-agonist anticholinergic ) would important determine mechanism reduction DH-induced critical ventilatory constraint achieve . BDs extensively study COPD patient , less extent CHF patient . Little known PAH patient . Spiekerkoetter colleague recently point inhaled β2-agonists able cause mild significant increase rest FEV1 , FEF50 % FEF75 % PAH patient . They also show inhalation β2-agonists determine significant increase rest cardiac output accompany increase stroke volume decrease pulmonary systemic vascular resistance , presence change heart rate . To date , information available effect inhale β2-agonists ventilatory , mechanical perceptual response exercise PAH patient . It argue β2-agonists may reduce and/or delay rate onset DH-induced critical ventilatory constraint 1 ) reduce ventilatory demand response exercise , and/or 2 ) modifying shape limit maximal flow-volume loop ( MFVL ) . In first case , improve cardiac function concurrent ventilation-perfusion relation follow β2-agonists would reduce ventilatory demand , thereby reduce rate DH enhance VT expansion exercise . This , turn , would expect reduce perceive exertional dyspnoea , clearly show patient COPD follow BDs . In second case , β2-agonists would increase maximal volume-corrected expiratory flow rate effort-independent mid-volume range tidal breathing occur ( i.e. , increase FEF50 % FEF75 % ) , show CHF . This mean PAH patient would accomplish require alveolar ventilation lower operating lung volume , therefore , reduce oxygen cost breathing exercise . The corollary PAH patient would increase end-expiratory lung volume ( i.e. , DH ) less extent inhalation β2-agonist , likely salutary sensory consequence ( i.e. , reduction dyspnoea intensity ) patient PAH , clearly show patient COPD . Inhaled anticholinergic agent yet study , neither rest exercise PAH . Inhalation anticholinergic agent would increase maximal volume-corrected expiratory flow rate effort-independent mid-volume range tidal breathing occur , without interfere cardiac pulmonary vascular function , show patient CHF . The attendant increase FEF50 % FEF75 % ( tidal breathing occurs ) follow inhaled anticholinergic agent would cause VT accommodate low operating lung volume , thus reduce extent DH concurrent ventilatory constraint impose accelerated ventilatory response exercise . This , turn , likely salutary sensory consequence ( i.e. , reduction dyspnoea intensity ) patient PAH . The interest study dyspnoea evaluation BDs PAH patient , therefore , evident appealing , least two reason : 1 ) information literature effect pharmacological intervention dyspnoea intensity ( measure Borg score ) cycle exercise PAH population , 2 ) investigator know much dyspnoea intensity ( measure Borg score ) change BD administration PAH population Minimally Clinically Important Difference ( MCID ) establish measurement dyspnoea intensity . Nonetheless , base COPD study , short-term post-intervention change dyspnoea intensity ~1 Borg unit standardize exercise time V ' E appear clinically meaningful , therefore team assume MCID may also apply PAH patient undergoing cycle exercise test BD intervention .</detailed_description>
