	<brief_summary>In prospective case-control study , investigator evaluate diagnostic performance novel electronic nose ( E-nose ) detection Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ( PAH ) . This study design : 1 . Assess performance E-nose discriminate control patient PAH 2 . Assess performance E-nose discriminate different subtypes pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) , namely idiopathic PAH , heritable PAH BMPR2 mutation chronic thromboembolic PH 3 . Assess performance E-nose discriminate control asymptomatic patient PH carry BMPR2 mutation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) progressive rare severe disease ( prevalence 15-50 per million ) due obstruction small pulmonary artery , lead increase pulmonary artery pressure ultimate consequence right heart failure . Despite recent advance therapeutic care , cure patient die require lung transplantation within 5 year diagnosis . Currently , right heart catheterisation require diagnose PAH monitor response treatment . Right heart catheterisation invasive test , alternative echocardiography yield sufficient accuracy early diagnosis disease monitoring . Currently , PAH often diagnose advanced stage disease . There often delay diagnosis several year first symptoms identification disease due non-specific nature symptom . Hence , need improve time first sign definitive diagnosis disease . Early diagnosis PAH remain challenge due low sensitivity specificity biomarkers available currently . The main objective validate result obtain previous preliminary proof concept study - PAH patient display unique olfactory signature detect artificial E- nose . Secondary objective investigate ability E-nose : - Discriminate patient idiopathic PAH heritable PAH due BMPR2 mutation - Discriminate patient chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH ) healthy control , patient idiopathic and/or heritable PAH . - Detect development PAH BMPR2 mutation carrier - Determine whether olfactory signature stratify subgroups patient correlate olfactory signature different biological clinical parameter ( hemodynamic measurement , NYHA class , duration treatment , 6-minute walk distance , response nitric oxide , BNP level ) .</detailed_description>
