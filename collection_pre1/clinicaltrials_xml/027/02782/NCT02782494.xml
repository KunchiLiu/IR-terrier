	<brief_title>Comparing Consistency QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus QuantiFERON-TB Gold Latent Tuberculosis Dialysis Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) remain one important infectious disease worldwide . According World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate , 9 million new TB case 1.5 million related death 2013 . Future control strategy include early treatment prevent transmission treatment latent TB infection ( LTBI ) reduce reactivation . Patients renal failure undergoing dialysis increase risk TB due attenuate cellular immunity . For instance , risk develop active TB dialysis population 7.8-25 time higher general population . However , TB diagnosis usually delay frequent extra-pulmonary manifestation . Thus , LTBI detection specific group important . Positive result interferon-gamma release assay ( IGRAs ) exclusion active TB current diagnostic base LTBI , precursor tuberculosis reactivation . However , recent report show high negative reversion rate quantiFERON Gold In-tube ( QFT-GIT ) , kind IGRA , cohorts health care worker ( 33 % 18 week ) close TB contact ( 35 % six month ) , patient receive long-term dialysis ( 46 % six month ) . This phenomenon question clinical significance single positive IGRA result . Increasing IGRA threshold serial follow-up improve specificity suggest comparison risk TB development . Therefore , increase accuracy stability improve rate negative conversion positive IGRA result important . Currently , new generation QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus include two tube CD4 CD8 T cell response , indicate TB immune response specifically . The investigator apply project compare performance diagnose LTBI QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus compare QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube .</detailed_description>
