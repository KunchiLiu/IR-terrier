	<brief_title>Curcumin Preventing Gastric Cancer Patients With Chronic Atrophic Gastritis Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare change gastric mucosal interleukin ( IL ) -1beta cytokine level , quantify Luminex assay technology , 6 month intervention participant randomly assign curcumin ( Meriva ) versus placebo arm . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability Meriva versus placebo . II . To compare change Histology Gastric Score ( HGS ) baseline 6 month Meriva versus placebo . III . To compare change additional gastric mucosal cytokine/chemokine level ( IL-8 , tumor necrosis factor-alpha [ TNFalpha ] , inducible protein [ IP ] -10 ; quantify Luminex assay ) . IV . To compare change gastric mucosal deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) damage ( gamma H2A histone family , member X [ gamma-H2AX ] assess flow cytometry ) . V. To explore association proinflammatory cytokine genotype status ( IL-1beta , IL-8 , TNFalpha single nucleotide polymorphisms [ SNPs ] ; characterize baseline ) outcomes . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM 1 : Patients receive curcumin orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 180 day absence unacceptable toxicity . ARM 2 : Patients receive placebo PO BID 180 day . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day 7 month .</detailed_description>
