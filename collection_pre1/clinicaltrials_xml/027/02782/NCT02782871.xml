	<detailed_description>Following major head neck surgery may necessary keep patient intubated ventilate least 12 hour allow swell associate operation subside . Therefore patient ( participant ) transfer intensive care unit anaesthetise , in-tubated ventilate . Current practice patient manually ventilate , hand , transfer operate theatre intensive care unit . Studies show use manual ventilation cause variability respiratory parameter blood gas value due inconsistent ventilation . A study 2003 find portable ventila-tor provide consistent ventilation patient less likely disparity blood gas , oxygenation ventilation.. However , conventional ventilator bulky , heavy , expensive far hospital , particular , pre-hospital setting . The Pneupac VR1 ventilator simple use , small , portable durable . It easy clean , low cost , light weight magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compatible . The study aim directly compare efficiency efficacy ( ventilation rate tidal volume ) manual ventilation new device , VR-1 portable ventilator , Smith-Medical . The device CE approve . The RCT compare efficacy efficiency transfer patient theater intensive care establishment . The endpoint arrival intensive care unit ( ICU ) transfer onto ICU ventilator . This measure collect pCO2 , take already in-situ arterial blood gas ( ABG ) , two time point - ( ) patient transfer theater intensive care unit ( b ) upon arrival intensive care unit prior transfer onto ITU ventilator .</detailed_description>
