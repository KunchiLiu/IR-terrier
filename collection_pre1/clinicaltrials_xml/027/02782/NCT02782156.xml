	<brief_summary>In ear , nose , throat ( ENT ) jaw surgery department , 60 % patient suffer alcohol dependence ( Allen et al. , 2009 ) , may develop alcohol withdrawal syndrome ( AWS ) undergo sur-gery . Caring patient create major challenge person involve : Health care staff challenge primary illness also increase risk life-threatening complication ( infection , bleeding , cardiopulmonary dysfunction , impair wound healing , re-operation ) , high mortality rate , long duration hospitalization due preoperative alcohol use development AWS ( Delgado-Rodriguez , Gomez-Ortega , Mariscal-Ortiz , Palma-Perez , &amp; Sillero-Arenas , 2003 ; Eyer et al. , 2011 ; Foy , Kay , &amp; Taylor , 1997 ; Genther &amp; Gourin , 2012 ; Kuo et al. , 2008 ; Mayo-Smith et al. , 2004 ; McCusker , Cole , Abrahamowicz , Primeau , &amp; Belzile , 2002 ; Neyman , Gourin , &amp; Terris , 2005 ; O'Brien et al. , 2007 ) . Moreover , nearly five percent patient AWS develop alcohol withdrawal delirium ( AWD ) , without therapy , end lethally 15 % case . With adequate medical intervention lethality two percent ( Diener , 2003 ; Wright , Myrick , Henderson , Peters , &amp; Malcolm , 2006 ) . Additionally , occurrence AWS / AWD represent threatening , time-intensive complex situation family member ( Repper-DeLisi et al. , 2008 ; Yu et al. , 2012 ) . Since 2011 , addition patient undergo short-term surgery , also patient oncological diagnosis hospitalize ENT Jaw Surgery Department University Hospital Basel ( USB ) . These patient need prolonged surgical treatment result long period abstinence food drink , include alcohol substance , increase risk alcohol withdrawal . For instance , ENT Jaw Surgery Department , 2011 , 74 910 inpatient risk already experience AWD 47 need permanent supervision guarantee safety . Bridging period abstinence drink alcohol pre- postoperatively suboptimal option patient due relatively long surgical treatment . This situation call action : base positive experience within dementia-delirium-programme USB ( Hasemann &amp; Pretto , 2006 ) , evidence-based approach screen , detect treat AWS / AWD ENT jaw surgery patient develop implement ( Hasemann , 2013 ) . Now , new approach need evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Process Evaluation Standardised Nurse-led Approach Risk Screening Decrease Alcohol Withdrawal ENT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim propose study describe patient trajectory evaluate process structure nurse-led approach ENT Jaw Surgery Department USB . The following research question generate : Aim 1 ) : Who patient capture algorithm , risk factor , patient trajectory term decision , development , start , duration end AWS / AWD ? Specific question ask : - Which demographic medical characteristic patient ? - How many patient risk AWD / AWS ? - Which decision patient make ? - What time onset , duration end AWS / AWD ? - Were additional resource use guarantee safety patient ? Aim 2 ) : How prevention algorithm adhere ? Specific question ask : - How many patient risk-assessed nurse hospital admission ? - How many patient ask eventually ask agree substitution therapy ? - How many patient risk assess use Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment ( CIWA ) -Ar ? - How many time delirium expert consultation service contact due reason state algorithm ?</detailed_description>
