	<brief_title>Hyoid Suspension Mandible Treatment Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) become major heath problem United States . With prevalence middle-aged adult 2 4 % population , untreated OSA implicate increase risk cardiovascular disease , include hypertension heart failure . The first line common treatment OSA continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment , utilized estimate 3 million Americans . CPAP effective reduce AHI use properly . However , nasal mask require CPAP sleep lead poor acceptance compliance rate . Published study CPAP show 58 80 % patient accept CPAP therapy , , 65 90 % patient exhibit long-term compliance CPAP . Additionally , many patient would choose therapy besides CPAP . Patients cite number issue CPAP , namely discomfort inability sleep connect air pump . Auto-titrating CPAP , heat humidified air , bi-PAP ( different pressure inspiration expiration ) improve patient compliance , remain significant unmet clinical need . It widely accept region behind tongue major site collapse obstructive sleep apnea . In fact , many surgical procedure perform currently address tongue base collapse . These include : RF ablation ( Somnoplasty ) tongue base ; genioglossus advancement ; Medtronic 's Repose system tongue base suspension ; hyoid suspension ; maxillomandibular advancement ( MMA ) . The change airway dimension MMA surgery lateral cephalograph present Figure 1 . One principal mechanism effect MMA surgery move base tongue attach structure forward . Hyo-mandibular suspension previously study treatment OSA show highly effective . This prospective , multi-center , registry 30 subject OSA consider hyo-mandubular suspension treatment . After obtain informed consent meeting inclusion exclusion criterion , subject treat use Encore System . Subject follow-up physician nurse occur one ( 1 ) week , one ( 1 ) month , three ( 3 ) month , twelve ( 12 ) month . This study ass effectiveness hyoid suspension reduce apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) , improve Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) , snore ( VAS ) functional outcome ( FOSQ ) treatment obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . In addition , study evaluate effect change hyoid position airway anatomy .</detailed_description>
