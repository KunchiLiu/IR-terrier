	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To demonstrate noninferiority efficacy Toujeo® Tresiba® glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) change . Secondary Objectives : - To assess effect insulin Toujeo® comparison insulin Tresiba® : - Change Fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) ; - Change Fasting self-monitored plasma glucose ( SMPG ) 4-point SMPG 8-point SMPG profile ; - Percentage patient reach HbA1c target &lt; 7 % ≤6.5 % ; - Percentage patient reach HbA1c target &lt; 7 % ≤6.5 % without severe and/or confirm hypoglycemia - Percentage patient require rescue therapy . - To assess frequency occurrence diurnal distribution hypoglycemia American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) category hypoglycemia . - To assess safety treatment group . - To assess treatment effect treatment group Patient Reported Outcomes ( PRO ) .</brief_summary>
