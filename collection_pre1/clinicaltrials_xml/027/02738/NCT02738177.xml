The study approve Hospital Ethical Committee . Informed consent obtain participant explanation aim study &amp; potential adverse effect . The study support pharmacological company . Inclusion criterion include maternal age 18-40 year , 1st trimesteric pregnancy loss gestational age 12 week less ( diagnosis confirm use transvaginal ultrasound accord follow criterion : Crown-rump length { CRL } 7 mm heartbeat , Mean sac diameter { MSD } 25 mm embryo , absence embryo heartbeat 2 wk scan show gestational sac without yolk sac absence embryo heartbeat 11 day scan show gestational sac yolk sac ) * &amp; close firm cervix . Exclusion criterion include evidence suggest spontaneous onset abortion ( vaginal bleeding uterine cramp ) , previous trial induce abortion use cervical ripening agent current pregnancy , presence suspicion septic abortion ( fever &gt; 38 C , offensive vaginal discharge &amp; leukocytosis ) , Uterine anomaly history cervical surgery manipulation . For patient , full history take follow complete physical examination ( include cervical assessment ) , transvaginal ultrasound ( confirm early pregnancy loss ) &amp; routine preoperative investigation . Patient randomize one three group ( use computer generate random number ) accordingly investigator give either 2 tablet misoprostol 200ug ( misoprostol group ) 2 tablet Effox 20 mg ( Effox group ) 1 tablet misoprostol 200ug &amp; 1 tablet Effox 20 mg ( Combination therapy group ) . For participant , route administration intravaginal route ( tablet place high posterior fornix vagina . Only patient blind nature tablet . 4 hr later , patient admit operating room surgical evacuation follow technique : general anesthesia &amp; assessment cervical consistency ( soft firm ) &amp; dilatation ( tested number large Hegar 's dilator pass without resistance ) , ultrasound-guided suction evacuation do follow fine curettage use appropriate size curette . All participant monitor change vital sign ( every hour ) , occurrence headache &amp; severe abdominal cramp since onset drug administration till 6 hour postoperative . 1ry outcome include cervical consistency &amp; dilatation immediately procedure . 2ry outcome include total duration operation occurrence drug-related side effect namely high temperature ( 38 ) severe abdominal pain misoprostol headache low blood pressure Effox .</detailed_description>
