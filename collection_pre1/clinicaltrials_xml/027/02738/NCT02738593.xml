	<detailed_description>Study backgroud : third generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKIs ) new target therapy non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Two major study publish NEJM show overall response rate 60 % -70 % , progression free survival 10 month . However , know specific mechanism non-responders patient grow resistance . Next generation sequence current sensitive specific method exam gene mutation , diversion etc . By consistently detect cf-DNA , could possibly find mechanisms response resistance . Eligible patient receive 3rd generation EGFR-TKIs ( AZD9291 AVITINIB ) enrol study . Tumor tissue sample within 6 month , 10ml periphereal blood sample collect baseline . After treatment initiation , 10ml periphereal blood would collect every image test time point disease progression . Blood sample draw use EDTA tube centerfuged within 2 hour store -80 refrigerator . NGS test cover target gene NSCLC .</detailed_description>
