	<brief_summary>Background : Community Health Centers care 20 million rural , low income minority Americans every year . Patients often complex mental health problem Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) Bipolar Disorder . However , Community Health Centers locate rural area face substantial challenge manage patient due lack onsite mental health specialist , stigma poor geographic access specialty mental health service community . As consequence , many rural primary care provider feel obligate , yet unprepared , manage disorder , many patient receive inadequate treatment continue struggle symptom . While integrated care model telepsychiatry referral model promise approach manage patient complex mental health problem rural primary care setting , study compare approach effective type patient . Objectives : The central question examine study whether good offsite mental health specialist support primary care provider ' treatment patient PTSD Bipolar Disorder integrate care model use telemedicine technology facilitate referral offsite mental health specialist . We hypothesize patient randomize integrated care well outcomes patient randomize referral care . Methods : 1,000 primary care patient screen positive PTSD Bipolar Disorder recruit Community Health Centers three state ( Arkansas , Michigan Washington ) randomize integrate care model referral model . Patient Outcomes : Telephone survey administer patient enrollment 6 12 month follow-up . Telephone survey measure access care , therapeutic alliance provider , patient-centeredness , patient activation , satisfaction care , appointment attendance , medication adherence , self-reported clinical symptom , medication side-effects , health relate quality life , progress towards life goal . A sub-sample patient invited participate qualitative interview describe treatment experience use word . Likewise , primary care provider invite participate qualitative interview voice perspective .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Significance : Community Health Centers ( CHCs ) nation 's large fast grow network primary care ( PC ) clinic . There 1,200 CHCs provide clinical service 21 million Americans . Almost half ( 49 % ) CHC patient live rural area , 72 % live Federal Poverty Level ( 100 % ) , 67 % racial/ethnic minority , 36 % uninsured . Nationally , one million CHC patient diagnose psychiatric disorder need mental health ( MH ) service increase exponentially , 547 % increase CHC patient psychiatric diagnosis 2001 2012 . CHCs locate rural area face great challenge manage psychiatric disorder due lack MH specialist staff weak linkages CHCs MH specialist community . Because rural , minority , low income CHC patient face insurmountable geographical , cultural financial barrier specialty MH care , many PC provider feel obligate , yet unprepared , manage complex psychiatric disorder like posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) Bipolar Disorder ( BD ) . PTSD BD devastate psychiatric disorder often go undetected untreated PC . Most patient receive effective specialty MH care problem care provided PC setting often poor ineffective . Patients PTSD BD significantly bad educational attainment , low family , social , occupational functioning , significantly low quality life . Comparative effectiveness research need guide policy maker best manage grow demand MH service CHCs . Study Aims : The central question address mixed-methods pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial whether good expand scope collaborative care program treat patient complex psychiatric disorder facilitate successful referral specialty mental health care . The primary objective trial compare Telepsychiatry Collaborative Care ( TCC ) Telepsychiatry Enhanced Referral ( TER ) patient provider perspective . The secondary objective determine whether patient engage TER , improve Phone-Psychiatry Enhanced Referral ( PER ) . There four specific aim . Specific Aim # 1 : To quantitatively compare treatment experience , engagement , self-reported clinical outcome , recovery-oriented outcome patient initially randomize TCC TER . Specific Aim # 2 : For subset patient randomize TER engage treatment still symptomatic 6 month , quantitatively compare treatment experience , treatment engagement , self-reported clinical outcome recovery-oriented outcome patient randomize continued-TER PER . Specific Aim # 3 : To gain in-depth understanding patient ' provider ' treatment experience , qualitatively compare randomize TCC , TER PER . Specific Aim # 4 : To examine treatment heterogeneity among subgroups patient randomize TCC TER base race/ethnicity , age clinical severity . Study Description : The study conduct 15 CHC system locate state Arkansas , Michigan Washington . These 15 CHC treat 294,645 adult patient live rural area ; 96.1 % live poverty 53 % racial/ethnic minority . Participating clinic screen patient PTSD BD patient screen positive recruit . We enroll 1,000 patient ( 500 PTSD 500 BD ) . A Sequential , Multiple Assignment , Randomized Trial ( SMART ) design use compare TCC TER , determine whether patient engage TER improve PER . Specifically , patient engage TER six month randomize second time either continued-TER PER . Patients randomize TCC meet offsite telepsychiatrist consultant via interactive video begin treatment assign accurate diagnosis provide treatment recommendation PC provider retain primary responsibility treatment . In addition , PC provider support onsite care manager conduct patient outreach foster proactive communication activate informed patient coordinate care team . Patient randomize TER remain PC setting , receive ongoing pharmacotherapy psychotherapy offsite MH specialist via interactive video . Patients engage respond TER randomize PER receive ongoing treatment offsite MH specialist via phone comfort home . We use pragmatic trial design , broad inclusion criterion ( screen positive PTSD BD ) limit exclusion criterion ( already engage specialty MH care ) . Intervention fidelity measure , control . Patient engagement also measure , require , intent treat analysis conduct . Patients unit randomization . Mixed quantitative qualitative method use assess self-reported outcome . All patient administer survey baseline , 6 12 month telephone minimize patient burden attrition . A sub-sample patient invited participate qualitative interview describe treatment experience use word . Likewise , PC provider invite participate qualitative interview voice perspective . The primary outcome patient self-reported health relate quality life . Secondary outcome include access care , therapeutic alliance provider , patient-centeredness , patient activation , satisfaction care , appointment attendance , medication adherence , self-reported clinical symptom , medication side-effects , progress towards life goal .</detailed_description>
