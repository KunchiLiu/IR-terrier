	<detailed_description>Scientific Background Significance Introduction Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) represent major health care concern United States . It estimate approximately 5 million patient U.S. CHF , nearly 550,000 people diagnosed disease annually . It known sudden cardiac death occur frequently set structural heart disease . Moreover , risk sudden cardiac death 6 9 time great heart failure population , cardiac arrhythmia perhaps leading cause death CHF patient . Currently , American College Cardiology American Heart Association endorse placement implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) patient ischemic cardiomyopathy , reasonable life expectancy , reduce ejection fraction 40 % ( class I , level evidence A ) . Additionally , placement ICDs recommend non-ischemic cardiomyopathy patient meet similar requirement ejection fraction le 35 % ( class I , level evidence B ) . Despite recommendation primary prevention sudden death way ICD implantation , half patient receive device likely experience arrhythmic event necessitates ICD therapy delivery . ICD device , average , cost $ 20,000-50,000 exclusive operative follow cost . Currently , risk stratification sudden cardiac death need ICD placement essentially dependent upon assessment leave ventricular ejection fraction . Other method employ risk stratification signal average electrocardiogram ( ECG ) another electrocardiographic technique know T-wave alternans . Although method FDA approve risk prediction cardiac death , technique widely employ U.S. give equipment personnel cost implement . Thus , alternative test risk assessment development sudden cardiac death heart failure population desirable . Role Sodium Channels SCN5A Gene The cardiac voltage-gated sodium ( Na+ ) channel , SCN5A , main channel generate current electrical propagation heart muscle target many antiarrhythmic drug . Defective expression cardiac Na+ channel result increase arrhythmic risk evidence sudden death Brugada Syndrome . SCN5A mutation also implicate inherited long-QT syndrome , result development fatal dysrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation torsades de pointes . Additionally , mutation SCN5A gene also propose exist enhance risk drug-induced dysrhythmias . Many study do shed light role tetrodotoxin-insensitive sodium channel disease state . It demonstrate mutated sodium channel dilate cardiomyopathy may function differently depend upon specific mutation type principal Na+ channel . Specifically , Nguyen et al demonstrated mutation may lead change physiological function slow action potential rise time , enhance late sodium current steady state , impaired inactivation . Additional mutation SCN5A gene link shifts voltage dependence Na+ channel inactivation patient idiopathic ventricular fibrillation . Prior research suggest decreased inactivation late sodium current may contribute action potential prolongation . A different SCN5A gene abnormality show lead decrease sodium current density positive shift cell membrane half-maximal activation potential . Therefore , mutation Na+ channel cause alter channel behavior arrhythmia . Previous study show disruption sodium handling may result change calcium homeostasis via action Na+/Ca2+ exchanger . Overall , change sodium current ( INa ) likely significantly contribute arrhythmia set fail myocardium . At genome level , research focus role SCN5A gene mutation arrhythmogenesis . Nevertheless , investigator recently describe acquired defect Na+ channel messenger RNA ( mRNA ) result reduce Na+ current occur failing heart . Three 3'-terminal SCN5A mRNA splice variant identify characterized fail human heart ventricle . Additional measurement suggest truncation mutant could cause electrical abnormality severe enough contribute arrhythmic risk . Also , investigator show lymphocyte process sodium channel similarly cardiomyocytes . Thus , lymphocyte SCN5A mRNA processing may serve surrogate marker ass SCN5A function cardiac level may correlate arrhythmic risk high risk population . This study determine SCN5A variant level predictive appropriate ICD therapy patient newly implant ICD .</detailed_description>
