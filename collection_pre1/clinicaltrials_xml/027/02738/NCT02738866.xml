	<brief_title>Palbociclib With Fulvestrant Metastatic Breast Cancer After Treatment With Palbociclib Aromatase Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In phase II trial , primary objective determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor ( CDK4/6i ) palbociclib fulvestrant woman men estrogen progesterone receptor ( ER/PR ) positive , HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) progress treatment palbociclib aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) . The study also determine prevalence rate estrogen receptor α ( ESR1 ) phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K ) mutation study population . The secondary objective include evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) participant without ESR1 mutation , PI3K mutation analysis tumor biopsy circulate plasma tumor DNA ( ptDNA ) sample . The study also describe alteration gene gene product relevant cell cycle , drug target , tumor sensitivity resistance , identify novel protein kinase activate biopsy participant hormone refractory MBC progress prior palbociclib AI . The data correlate tumor subtypes , expression profile , candidate phosphoprotein expression PFS study population .</detailed_description>
