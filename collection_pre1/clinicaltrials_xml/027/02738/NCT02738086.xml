	<detailed_description>This pilot study assess feasibility use Physical Activity Behavior Change ( PABC ) intervention Veterans dysvascular low limb amputation . In addition , preliminary efficacy PABC intervention assess use two-group randomized cross-over design . Testing occur baseline ( pre-intervention ) , three month ( end intervention ) , six month . The primary aim determine feasibility use PABC intervention Veterans dysvascular amputation measuring : 1. participant retention 2. dose goal attainment 3. participant acceptability 4. safety The secondary aim preliminary ass efficacy PABC intervention measure accelerometer-based physical activity self-report disability effect size .</detailed_description>
