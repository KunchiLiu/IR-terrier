	<brief_summary>Dolutegravir ( DTG ) lamivudine ( 3TC ) indicate combination antiretroviral agent treatment human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection . Fixed dose combination ( FDC ) tablets exist approve drug prefer many patient offer potential increased patient adherence consequently reduce likelihood virological failure viral resistance . The purpose present study evaluate relative bioavailability two experimental FDC tablet DTG 3TC relative co-administration single entity product healthy adult subject . This study conduct randomize , open label three-way , crossover design 6 treatment sequence approximately 30 subject . Each subject screen visit within 30 day prior first dose study drug , three treatment period single dose study drug follow-up visit within 7-14 day last dose study drug . There least 7 day washout dose period . The total duration participation subject study approximately 9 week .</brief_summary>
