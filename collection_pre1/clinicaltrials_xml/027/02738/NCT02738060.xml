	<brief_title>The Effect Baked Milk Cow 's Milk Allergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Food allergy , immune base hypersensitivity reaction , estimate 6 % young child 3-4 % adult [ 1 , 2 ] . Its pathophysiology define trough IgE non-IgE mediate mechanism , lead skin , gastrointestinal , respiratory systemic manifestation [ 1 ] . This type allergy mostly see trough first year life . One study show 2.5 % neonate show allergy cow 's milk [ 3 ] . Most food allergen cow 's milk , chicken egg , corn , soya , peanut , dry fruit , fish . Among , cow 's milk consider common one , specifically , among child [ 1 , 2 ] . This allergen consist 20 protein induce immune system produce antibody . The two major protein component milk casein whey . About 76 86 % casein , responsible IgE mediate immune response . On hand , whey , compose alpha-lactalbumin , beta-lactoglobulin , albumin , mostly induced systemic allergic reaction [ 4 ] . Boiling milk 95 c 20 minute damage whey 's protein component ; however , damage major milk 's allergen . Pasteurization also show effect allergens [ 5 ] . It show IgE mediate mechanism involve lifelong cow 's milk allergy . In spite , 50 % child 1 year old 85 % 3 year old develop tolerance milk 's allergen [ 6 ] . Oral food challenge ( OFC ) test confirm skin prick test serum IgE level one sensitive tool diagnosis food allergy . It show sensitivity 95 % specificity 50 % [ 7 ] . Comparing baked milk non-heated milk allergy show one allergy bake milk chance develop anaphylactic reaction . Some study patient tolerate bake milk suggest add product daily diet sensitive child improve tolerance cow 's milk [ 8 , 9 ] . On hand , another study Australia show phenotype strong predictor tolerance development alter allergen bake milk significant effect process [ 10 ] . Thus , accord controversy effect bake milk immunotherapy cow 's milk allergy well necessity develop safe method milk 's allergy due high risk anaphylactic reaction milk 's product patient , seem essential perform study assess possibility tolerance induction bake milk cow 's milk allergic child .</detailed_description>
