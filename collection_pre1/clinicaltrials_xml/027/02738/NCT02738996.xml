	<detailed_description>Overall Study Design : The study three-treatments , two-periods balance incomplete block trial . Participants randomize block complete two three treatment condition ( lab intervention A , B C ) , different sequence . The three treatment condition ; - Intervention A : Sitting 8 hour interrupt 3 min light intensity walking ( LIW , 3.2 km/h ) break every 60 min - Intervention B : Sitting 8 hour interrupt 3 min light intensity walking ( LIW , 3.2 km/h ) break every 30 min - Intervention C : Sitting 8 hour interrupt 3 min light intensity walking ( LIW , 3.2 km/h ) break every 15 min There 5 day washout period intervention . Each participant complete two three treatment condition within 15 day experimental period ( 4 day pre monitoring period - 1 day lab intervention - 5 day washout period - 1 day lab intervention - 4 day post monitoring period ) . The participant wear Abbot FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring device activPAL ( activity monitor ) throughout 15 day experimental period . Pre-monitoring period : On day 1 experimental period , participant request come Diabetes Clinic ( Ayr hospital ) . Baseline anthropometric data ( e.g . age , gender , height , weight body mass index ) drug history also record researcher . The participant fit Abbot FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring device ( sensor ) activPAL , activity monitor . We also provide participant 24 h diet recall form record daily food intake throughout study period ( 15 day ) . After participant return home , instructed scan blood glucose every 8 h use FreeStyle Libre reader supply , record daily food intake , refrain smoking , alcohol , caffeine moderate vigorous physical activity throughout experimental period , come back day 5 . Lab intervention 1 : On day 5 experimental period ( intervention day ) , participant arrive Diabetes Clinic ( Ayr hospital ) 08:00 h overnight fast . Prof. A Collier ( Chief Investigator ) researcher meet participant reception . The participant seat 08:00 h 09:00 h , achieve physiological steady state , consult room ( private room ) . During period , intravenous catheter insert antecubital vein hourly blood collection clinician ( two clinical teach fellow ) , researcher explain procedure offer choice entertainment ( e.g . TV , DVD , Books Magazine ) . At 09:00 h , participant consume standardise meal/breakfast ( weetabix 52 gram plus 250ml full fat milk = 50grams carbohydrate cornflakes 45.4 gram plus 250ml full fat milk = 50 gram carbohydrate ) . After participant perform 3 min light intensity walking ( LIW ) either every 60 minute ( Intervention A ) , 30 minute ( Intervention B ) 15 minute ( Intervention C ) sit motorise treadmill pace 3.2 km/h . This sequence continue end intervention ( 16:00 h ) . Timing do researcher room participant . The researcher instruct participant stand walk treadmill per time specific condition . The participant guide treadmill start slowly researcher increase 3.2 km/h . At end walk period , researcher slowly decrease speed participant come steady stand . The participant instruct resume sit position . Every hour clinician ( two clinical teach fellow ) collect 12 ml blood sample patient inserted catheter . This sequence repeat condition complete . At 12:36 h , participant serve standardised lunch ( sandwich x 2 slice thick bread 40 gram carbohydrate , yogurt 14-16 gram carbohydrate , crisp 25 gram multipack bag 13-15 gram carbohydrate ) sit period . At end intervention intravenous catheter remove clinician ( two clinical teach fellow ) . A standardised dinner ( sandwich x 2 slice thick bread 40 gram carbohydrate , yogurt 14-16 gram carbohydrate , crisp 25 gram multipack bag 13-15 gram carbohydrate ) also provide , participant instruct dinner 17:00 h home . Participants instruct avoid food day apart standardise dinner provide . Washout period : There 5 day washout period two treatment condition ( intervention A , B C ) . The chief investigator researcher stay touch participant period remind participant come back perform another lab intervention 5 day . The chief investigator researcher use mode communication convenient participant ( phone email ) contact schedule visit . Lab intervention 2 : On day 11 experimental period , participant come back arrive Diabetes Clinic ( Ayr hospital ) 08:00 h overnight fast perform lab intervention 2 . Every procedure lab intervention 2 lab intervention 1 except perform another three treatment condition , perform lab intervention 1 . Post-monitoring period : Physical activity continuous glucose monitoring continue four day , day 12 day 15 experimental period , lab intervention 2 . This regarded post-monitoring period . During period participant also remind avoid caffeine , alcohol , smoke moderate vigorous physical activity . On day 15 , participant report back laboratory ( Diabetes Clinic Ayr Hospital ) morning removal Abbot FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring device activPAL . After , participant thank return home . This end experimental period participant . Qualitative investigation : During second laboratory intervention , participant ask take part one one interview . The interview semi-structured focus participant 's view experience use mobile-based technology Type 2 diabetes management . During interview , participant show variety mobile-based technology currently available include wearable technology mobile/tablet apps .
