	<brief_summary>Concurrent chemoradiotheray standard care patient locally advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , often accompany high toxicity poor tolerability . Radiosensitization epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) prove preclinical study , safety TKI combine thoracic radiotherapy also evaluate several phase II trial . The aim study investigate efficacy safety thoracic radiotherapy combine TKI wild-type EGFR patient refuse unsuitable concurrent chemoradiotherapy .</brief_summary>
