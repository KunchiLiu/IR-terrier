	<detailed_description>The study carry two phase . Phase one ( 4 week ) focus evaluate usability Novus system . Phase two ( 8 week ) enable continued clinical follow . The study include sixteen ( 16 ) subject suffer foot drop thigh muscle weakness due upper motor neuron injury disease ; eight ( 8 ) subject new user Functional Electrical Stimulation ( FES ) experience eight ( 8 ) experience Ness L300/Ness L300 Plus user . Phase two study include new user . The primary objective study evaluate usability Novus system among patient gain subject ' feedback regard device use daily basis . The secondary objective obtain information performance system gait assistive device evaluate subject 's Quality Life use system . System usability evaluate adapted 5 point Likert scale usability questionnaire patient 's feedback questionnaire . Quality life ( QoL ) measure Participation scale questionnaire functional ambulation assessment ; modify Emory Functional Ambulation Profile ( mEFAP ) perform without system 2 minute walk test ( 2MWT ) without system .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Upper motor neuron injury disease . Foot drop toe drag walking . Lower limb spasticity 04 accord modify Ashworth scale . Responsible mental state , able follow multiple step direction . Aged 18 80 year old . At least six month post diagnosis Available participate study . Able understand sign inform consent form . Able walk independently assist device ( e.g . cane , walker etc . ) / spot guard least 10 meter . Sufficient response electrical stimulation ( visible muscle contraction seat prone position designate muscle separately ) . Subjects demandtype cardiac pacemaker , defibrillator electrical metallic implant . Cancerous lesion lower limb , present suspect . Medical condition prevents participation would likely lead inability comply protocol [ e.g . : congestive heart failure , patient receive chemotherapy , uncontrolled epilepsy , etc. ] . Skin lesion site stimulation electrode . Change bonejoint structure low limb , : Contractures ( ROM dorsiflexion &lt; 0 ) Deformations ; fracture dislocation , would adversely affected motion stimulation . Pregnancy . Diagnosis major depression psychotic disorder . Participation another investigation may directly indirectly affect study result . Unable tolerate electrical stimulation .</criteria>
