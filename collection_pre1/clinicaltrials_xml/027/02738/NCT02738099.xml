	<detailed_description>Research Design Methods : General Approach : This study prospective , non-randomized , unblinded case series comatose patient present cardiac arrest either Essentia East ( St. Mary 's Medical Center Miller-Dwan Medical Center ) Essentia West ( Innovis Health ) . Methods Materials : Patients enrol 60-month period PI , Sub-I , study coordinator . The enrollment goal 100 patient . The study collect demographic , clinical outcome data comatose patient present cardiac arrest , prescribe clinical test therapy include PCI hypothermia . All clinical decision leave discretion attend provider . Consent Process : This study seek waiver inform consent patient , study inclusion criterion , able provide inform consent , study use minimal risk design . In spirit transparency , attempt make inform patient , patient representative family possible enrollment study within 48 hour enrollment . The patient appropriate patient representative identify EMR speak person phone PI , sub-PI , study coordinator.21 The patient and/or family opportunity decline participation study . The conversation document medical record PI , sub-PI study coordinator . Randomization Process : The study prospective , non-randomized , unblinded case series . Patient follow single cohort , randomization require . Study Endpoints : Primary Endpoint : • Death cause 30 day admission . Secondary Endpoints : - Death cause 30 day admission stratify SCAI22 score - Death cause 30 day admission stratify presence absence PCI - Neurological status time discharge use Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral-Perfusion Categories23,24 Observational Data Collection : Demographic clinical data collect study investigator study coordinator within 24 hour admission . Potential candidate participation identify PI , sub-PI , study coordinator every morning contact attend critical care cardiology attend physician every morning . Once identify , study PI , sub-PI , study coordinator begin chart review data collection . Diagnostic therapeutic management leave discretion attend provider . The protocol mandate evaluation therapy outside usual practice attend provider . Baseline Demographic data include : Date birth/Age Gender LVEF prior admission Presence absence coronary artery disease Presence absence Comorbidities include COPD , diabetes , renal failure active malignancy , dementia , anemia Presence congestive Presence angina CCS functional class heart failure prior admission NYHA functional Ethnicity class prior admission Baseline Clinical Variables obtain include:25 Vitals sign presentation receive facility include blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , weight , height Witnessed unwitnessed arrest Presence absence bystander CPR Resuscitation attempt trained emergency personnel prior arrival initial facility ( receive transfer ) Initial Rhythm prior ROSC ( pulseless arrest , initial rhythm AED place ) Therapies apply resuscitation include CPR , defibrillation , medication , intubation Estimated time initial arrest initial ROSC Initial electrocardiogram characteristic include presence absence ST elevation , rhythm , correct QT interval , QRS width Initial perfuse rhythm follow resuscitation Time arrival medical personnel scene arrest arrival receiving facility . If patient bring receive facility someone medical personnel , time set 0 . Time arrival referral center receive facility . If referral center also receive facility , time set 0 . Time arrival receive facility intensive care unit cath lab cath lab precedes ICU Time arrival cath lab receive facility Presence absence significance obstructive lesion list involved vessel patient undergoes coronary angiography hospitalization PCI perform vessel treat patient undergoes PCI hospitalization Presence absence ST elevation electrocardiogram within 24 hour admission referral facility Any use mechanical support within 24 hour admission referral facility Any use therapeutic cooling within 24 hour admission referral facility Any use vasopressor agent within 24 hour admission referral facility Admission hemoglobin , creatine , cardiac troponin , bicarbonate , pH , pO2 Glasgow Coma Score Presence absence cardiogenic shock within 24 hour admission referral facility Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction determine hospitalization Closest time death discharge During clinical stay , pertinence clinical data collect include recurrent cardiac arrest , need coronary angiography revascularization 24 hour admission , implantation implantable cardioverter-defibrillator prior discharge . Other significant clinical event also record include need transfusion surgery . A SCAI risk score22 calculate collect data study investigator coordinator within 24 hour admission . If patient dy prior discharge , date cause death note . Transfer hospice referral comfort care record . If patient discharge alive , Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Perfusion Category measurement neurological function time discharge assess . Disposition site ( home , hospice , skilled nursing facility , transfer high level care ) record . Thirty day follow-up perform review medical record , review public death record , phone call appropriate ass vital status . If record height weight available within first 24 hour , estimation either staff caring patient study coordinator may use . The study collect data include interaction subject .</detailed_description>
