	<detailed_description>Topotecan currently drug approve Europe United States treatment second line SCLC recovery first line treatment consider inappropriate . This raise problem know recovery first line treatment consider appropriate . Secondly , effectiveness response chemotherapy predict base response initial chemotherapy time interval stop first line treatment . A complete response initial treatment long disease-free interval predictor well response second-line treatment . There two group : say patient 'sensitive ' , correspond first-line chemotherapy relapse least 90 day first-line treatment group so-called patient `` Refractory '' refers patient progress 90 day patient respond progressed first-line treatment . Median survival different depend whether patient so-called `` sensitive '' `` refractory '' . When relapse occur six month end first line chemotherapy , usual practice reintroduce first-line treatment . This base old study number patient include low . If interval time first line treatment ≥ three month , two second-line treatment strategy possible resumption initial chemotherapy topotecan . The combination cisplatin etoposide show high response rate , whatever time relapse . There , however , randomize study literature compare topotecan reintroduction platinum salt associate etoposide . This study Randomized , multicenter , control , open-label , second line , 2 arm . Arm A : Carboplatin Auc 5 J1 Etoposide 100 mg / m² / J J1 J3 IV Arm B : topotecan 2.3 mg / m²J1 J5 po 1 line Etoposide Cisplatin carboplatin etoposide Time interval first-line chemotherapy relapse ≥ 90 day ( date set J1 last cycle ) J-28 : TDM thoracoabdominal , brain CT MRI brain , J 7 : Biology , quality life questionnaire ( Lung Cancer Symptom Scale ) . Assessment tumor response every 6 week chemotherapy post-chemotherapy follow 2nd line : TDM every 8 week progression death . The duration participation patient include trial inclusion 12 month . The planned total duration trial 5 year include 4 year patient inclusion</detailed_description>
