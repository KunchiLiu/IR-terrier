	<detailed_description>Intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) define fetal growth slow normal growth potential specific fetus genetic environmental factor . IUGR associate high incidence perinatal morbidity mortality . IUGR neonates great risk hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy , intraventricular hemorrhage necrotizing enterocolitis long hospital stay high health care cost . Incidence fetus develop small size gestational age 8 % . Fetal growth regulate balance fetal nutrient demand maternal placental nutrient supply . Intrauterine growth restriction may cause maternal , placental , fetal factor . Nearly one-third IUGRs due genetic cause , two-thirds related fetal environment . In develop world , IUGR likely consequence poor maternal nutritional status prior pregnancy . There two general pattern growth abnormality : symmetric asymmetric . Symmetric growth inhibition arise first half gestation , fetal growth occur primarily cellular division produce undersized fetus few cell normal size . Asymmetric growth inhibition occur second half gestation usually consequence inadequate availability substrates fetal metabolism . To prevent previously mention complication IUGR , important establish marker identify pregnancy risk IUGR early enough . Recently several study highlight role many bio-molecules marker IUGR like leptin , adiponectin , endothelin-1 , lactate dehydrogenase , s-endoglin , pregnancy associate plasma protein , metastin . Apart expensive , laboratories majority center equip facility measurement marker . Measurement maternal serum ferritin also use predictive marker increase risk IUGR one previous study limit number ( seventeen ) case . Ferritin intracellular protein consist 24 heavy light sub-units surround core store 4,500 iron atom . The two sub-units highly conserve evolution , heavy sub-unit ferroxidase activity . Ferritin release infiltrate leukocyte , response acute chronic infection . Ferritin acute phase reactant well know intracellular iron sequestration storage ability immune activation . Serum ferritin concentration positively correlate amount total body iron store absence inflammation . Serum ferritin consider valuable bio-marker body iron status healthy subjects.Iron deficiency know deleterious effect pregnancy iron loading may associate oxidative damage cell tissue . It show various study low level transferritin receptor expression placenta associate preeclampsia IUGR . This lead decrease extraction iron placenta maternal serum lead increase maternal serum ferritin . This fetal iron deficiency lead increase fetal corticotropin fetal cortisol , cause inhibition fetal growth .</detailed_description>
