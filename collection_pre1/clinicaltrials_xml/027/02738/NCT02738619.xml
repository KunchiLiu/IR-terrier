	<detailed_description>Vitamin D adjuvant subcutaneous specific immunotherapy patient allergic rhinitis BACKGROUND Allergic diseases consider pandemic 21 century . Allergic rhinitis ( AR ) common overall prevalence 4 40 % world . In Latin America , common chronic disease , overall prevalence 8 country assess 6.6 % . However , percentage remarkably low found ISAAC , show prevalence 27.9 % patient age 6 7 year 37.6 % 13 14 year . In child 10 year , prevalence 11.6 % Mexico child age 13 14 year Mexico 15 % . Studies Mexico , measure instrument ISAAC Phase III study , report overall prevalence allergic rhinitis 4.6 % . Allergic rhinitis chronic inflammatory disease nasal mucosa mediate IgE antibody specific allergen , participation various cell , cytokine , chemoattractants mediadores . Allergic rhinitis generates direct indirect cost include treatment chronic disease , comorbidities , social employment impact escolar absenteeism . The base immunopathological allergic rhinitis type I hypersensitivity mediate immunoglobulin type E ( IgE ) specific previously sensitize antigen , usually inhalado . Allergic sensitization response occur two step . The first antigen uptake antigen present cell ( APCs ) professional , B lymphocytes dendritic cell CPA . The CPA , process antigen inside present surface receptor major histocompatibility complex ( HLA ) class II , contact T-collaborator CD4 + ( TH2 ) cell . This activate TH2 cell interaction , result release several cytokine , interleukins 4 , 5 , 9 13 , stimulate TH2 cell , eosinophil cause differentiation specific B cell plasma cell produce specific immunoglobulin E allergen . Thus large amount specific IgE blood release . These specific IgE adhere receptor present high low affinity surface mast cell ( also call mast cell ) , render `` sensitize '' . The second step subsequent exposure allergen bind membrane IgE produce degranulation mast cell release preform mediator histamine , de novo synthesis mediator , include leukotrienes , prostaglandin , thromboxanes , kinin proteasas . This response early phase allergic reaction occur 10 30 minute exposure allergen . It useful , practical recommend follow international guideline ARIA ( Allergic Rhinitis Its Impact Asthma ) diagnosis , classification treatment rhinitis alérgica . ARIA propose investigate analyze clinical finding interrogation physical examination watery rhinorrhea , congestion , obstruction nasal itching , sneeze , allergic shiner , allergic salute , Dennie Morgan line ; laboratory data serum eosinophilia , serum total IgE level increase absence parasitosis eosinophils present nasal cytology , allow u confirm diagnosis allergic rhinitis subtypes , well type rhinitis . The definitive diagnosis make identify sign , symptom laboratory data previously mention identifiación IgE specific allergen allergens previously sensibilizado . There two way identify allergen skin test blood ImmunoCAP® . Once definitive diagnosis allergic rhinitis , management begin advice education patient family confirm disease treatment . Initial measure take prevent mitigate symptom allergic rhinitis two ; First , avoid contact allergens trigger second change environment . The medium-environmental measure often include modify factor know patient potentially source allergic response area home , school laboral environment . Drug treatment allergic rhinitis oral antihistamine topical , oral topical steroid , leukotriene inhibitor , membrane stabilize mast cell , limit control application topical decongestant anticolinérgicos . The unifying action among drug modulation immune response allergen . In case , pharmacological agent specific therapeutic target ( membrane stabilize mast cell , antihistamine ) others , agent generalize mode action alleviate immune response ( steroid ) . Skin test allow establish specific allergen cause hiperreactividad . This necessary start immunotherapy , administer advise deal patient persistent allergic rhinitis measure describe insufficient control . Documenting specific allergen sensitivity , preferably skin test vivo IgE , route inmunoterapia . Subcutaneous immunotherapy involve inject stagger amount allergen `` maintenance dose '' maximum tolerate dose relief síntomas13 . The treatment succeed change natural history disease specific immunotherapy ( SIT ) allergens ; today treatment elección14 . Subcutaneous immunotherapy history hundred year since first application England 1911 Leonard Noon15 . It apply two phase : phase tolerance induction maintenance . After induction phase tolerance dose gradually rise reach schedule dose mantenimiento13 phase begin . The maintenance dose deliver every two six week , depend characteristic extracto14 . Immunotherapy typically continue three five year result immunological tolerance ( define absence specific immune response allergen , whether self foreign , induce previous contact ) control symptom long term , even suspend , 75 % pacientes13,14 . The time take start therapeutic response prolong , average 6 meses13,14 . The main drawback , result problem , poor adherence treatment , therefore necessary find strategy accelerate response terapéutica16 . Today clearly know asthma use vitamin D plus immunotherapy decrease symptom medication use associate increase IgG4 , IL10 , TGF-b17 T lymphocytes reg18 . Also inhibit immunological reaction increase cytokine profile TH17 decrease IL-10 , mediate TH1 lymphocytes TH 1719 . In addition reduces inflammation cytokine-mediated expression TH219 cell . Previously , animal model demonstrate vitamin D decrease IL-5 IL-13 3 months20 . Several estudios21,22,25 , show vitamin D stimulate production CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 Treg + , would help produce temprano21 immunological tolerance . In patient asthma receive immunotherapy vitamin D compare another group receive immunotherapy improvement symptom document earlier first group , statistically significativa21 . Clinical trial proven vitamin D allergic disease like allergic rhinitis asthma dermatitis atópica22 . It known vitamin D supplementation conventional treatment atopic dermatitis improve resolution severity symptoms 40 % faster conventional treatment use alone , ie avoid allergen , skin hydration , antihistamine steroid ; also normalize pattern TH1 , TH2 , TH17 Treg 3 months22 . The American Society endocrinology consider normal serum 25 ( OH ) D 30 ng / ml , failure 21 29 ng / ml le 20 ng / ml23 deficiency . Previous study recommend patient benefit additional administration vitamin D exhibit serum 25 ( OH ) D le 30 ng / ml24,25 . The requirement child age 0 1 year old least 400 IU / day child 1 year , least 600 IU / day.27 . To keep blood level great 30 ng / ml need least 1000 IU / day child older 1 year . To correct vitamin D deficiency value 1000 IU 4000 IU use child without graves27 problem arise . If value great 5000 IU child use estricta27 medical supervision recommend . The side effect alteration serum level calcium parathormona27 . PROBLEM Allergic rhinitis represent global public health problem . In Mexico , prevalence range 10 30 % . Immunotherapy treatment choice , however , time take start therapeutic response prolong , average 6 month , result poor adhesion range 13 % 89 % . So need find strategies accelerate therapeutic response . It known administration vitamin D immunotherapy allergic disease , decrease symptom well use drug associate increase IgG4 , IL10 , TGF-b T reg cell . Also inhibit mediate immune reaction TH1 TH17 cell , reduces allergic inflammation cytokine expression mediate TH2 cell , although unknown whether start time decrease action specific immunotherapy child allergic rhinitis . It know add vitamin D conventional treatment patient atopic dermatitis decrease severity symptoms 40 % faster ( 3 month ) conventional treatment ( 5 month ) . Therefore propose administration vitamin D immunotherapy adjuvant , may decrease time onset immunotherapy least 40 % therefore effectiveness improve well adherence . JUSTIFICATION School work problem experience patient RA cause hyaline rhinorrhea , nasal obstruction itch sneeze save repetition . Often accompany respiratory symptom , red eye eye , eye pruritus , lacrimation photophobia . To lesser extent otic palatal pruritus . Poor control disease associate poor quality life , poor performance daily activity workplace / study , social economic problem . You complicate course allergic disease . ; 80 % patient asthma suffer allergic rhinitis 20 40 % patient allergic rhinitis likely asthma . Mortality low morbidity global public health problem . Another problem patient rhinitis alégica lack adherence subcutaneous specific allergen immunotherapy . It base recent study well-known mechanisms activity vitamin D particular element immune system , influence course allergic rhinitis research propose consider possibility good simple , economic contribution secure good adhesion specific immunotherapy . HYPOTHESIS If administration conventional treatment plus vitamin D patient atopic dermatitis asthma-like allergic rhinitis entity , decrease severity symptom 40 % faster compare conventional treatment , administer vitamin D along immunotherapy child allergic rhinitis decrease least 40 % time onset action subcutaneous specific immunotherapy early immunological changesTregTh17 ) consistent standardization laboratory value clinical improvement assess questionnaire validate quality life .
