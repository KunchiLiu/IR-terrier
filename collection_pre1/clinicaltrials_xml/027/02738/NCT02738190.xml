	<brief_summary>This randomize controlled trial compare two different prim composition ( albumin vs. fresh frozen plasma ) extracorporeal circulation pediatric patient 10 kg weight . The two approach employ moment actually evidence superiority one . This study aim test hypothesis Albumin superior fresh frozen plasma term minor bleed transfusional requirement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Extracorporeal circulation ( ECC ) neonates infant undergo cardiac surgery correction palliation cardiac defect characterize temperature variation , activation coagulation inflammatory cascade , hemodilution . An excessive dilution circulate mass determines variation colloid-oncotic pressure ( COP ) , together hydrostatic pressure , induces liquids exchange interstitial space plasma . COP variation together inflammatory response due extracorporeal circulation temperature variation main determinant interstitial pulmonary edema occurrence . Intravascular albumin responsible 80 % COP . Golab et al . randomize population neonates infant undergo pediatric cardiac surgery procedure order reach two different target COP administration different albumin amount . His result n't show significant difference primary secondary endpoint except postoperative ventilation duration . Trials adult patient undergoing cardiac surgery n't show difference bleed vary colloid solution employ . Albumin prefer artificial colloid due reduce risk anaphylactic reaction capacity maintain COP . Hemodilution associate reduction hematocrit , platelet count , fibrinogen coagulation factor concentration . Solutions employ ECC ( Extracorporeal Circulation ) circuit prim also contain component could impair hemostasis . In order reduce negative effect coagulation , many center pediatric surgery employ fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) prim solution . Oliver et al randomized population 51 cardiopathic , acyanotic child 10 kg weight receive either albumin FFP ECC priming . The author show reduction postoperative bleeding group receive FFP . No significant difference detect postoperative coagulation test . Other study small cohorts n't able detect significant difference two regimen apply Oliver colleague . Currently patient receive blood priming treat either FFP albumin order maintain correct COP . Comparative study limit small population n't yet provide definitive conclusion eventual superiority one regimen another . This randomize controlled trial compare employment 5 % Albumin ( ALB group ) versus Fresh Frozen Plasma ( FFP group ) prim per standard protocol extracorporeal circulation procedure . No modification normal clinical management patient plan . The primary endpoint reduce postoperative bleeding ( registered ml/kg first 12 postoperative hour ) . The secondary endpoint reduce transfusional requirement blood product ( pack red cell , fresh frozen plasma platelet register ml/kg begin extracorporeal circulation 48 hour termination surgery ) , ventilation support hospital stay duration . Safety endpoint represent percentage thromboembolic complication ( stroke , peripheric , pulmonary mesenteric thromboembolism ) . Both treatment employ trial consider standard .</detailed_description>
