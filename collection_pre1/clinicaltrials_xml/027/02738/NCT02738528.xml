	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) characterize dopaminergic neuron degeneration substantia nigra , midbrain , result presence motor disorder , tremor , rigidity , bradykinesia , postural instability . Researches show mental rehearsal learn motor skill mental practice ( MP ) , associate physical practice somatosensory imagination action , cause positive effect several motor task , speed motion , muscle strength performance accuracy . Thus , study aim report effect MP tooth brush training strategy people Parkinson 's disease . This project approve Ethics Committee Research Human be UFPE attempt compare presence bacterial biofilm 8 week brush mental practice training , base O'Leary 's index . The sample consist 35 people , divide two group : Intervention Group consist 17 people Parkinson 's , stag I III disease , underwent brush orientation associate PM , control group people without disease , receive orientation brush . Then , data evaluate factorial ANOVA 2x2 post hoc Tukey test consider p &lt; 0.05 . It observe intervention significant improvement control dental biofilm .</brief_summary>
