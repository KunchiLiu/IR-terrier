	<brief_summary>The use vasopressor supplement material local anesthetic commonly use procedure various field dentistry , ENT ( ear , nose , throat ) , Plastic Surgery , Hand surgery gastroenterology . Epinephrine use constrict small blood vessel , thus reduce bleed medical procedure , reduce toxicity reduce systemic absorption local anesthetic , prolong duration intensity neural blockage create local anesthetic . There description literature case use lidocain adrenaline cause adverse cardiac event arrhythmias , edema increase blood pressure ENT dentistry procedure . As far know never systematic examination incidence severity arrhythmia procedure local anesthesia . The purpose study : 1 . To examine prevalence type arrhythmia patient undergo medical procedure perform local anesthesia 2 . Examine whether add adrenaline local anesthetic affect incidence arrhythmia Determining prevalence type arrhythmia help determine need monitor type monitoring require procedure local anesthesia . The patient : 500 patient undergoing surgery medical procedure local anesthetic use Meir Hospital . Patients medical history know cardiac arrhythmia include . Methods : Patients undergo medical procedure prescribe , use local anesthesia without adrenaline , discretion surgeon , accordance usual routine apply nowadays . The amount type anesthesia use register . In addition routine monitoring currently perform ( blood pressure cuff non-invasive blood oxygen saturation ) continuous ECG monitoring device connect prior begin surgical procedure , patient discharge recovery room . The ECG monitoring result analyze detect arrhythmia . Side effect report patient ( palpitation , dizziness , fainting , CPR { cardiopulmonary resuscitation } ) record . In case arrhythmia detect , type arrhythmia presence clinical symptom investigate .</brief_summary>
