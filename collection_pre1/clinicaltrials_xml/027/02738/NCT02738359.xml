	<brief_title>Efficacy Colonoscopy , Colon Capsule Fecal Immunological Test Colorectal Cancer Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fecal immunological test ( FIT ) reference screen method average risk patient . FIT propose every 2 year asymptomatic subject average risk age 50 74 year France . Optical colonoscopy gold standard examination patient increase risk colorectal cancer first degree relative colorectal cancer ( relative risk 2 4 time general population ) . Colonoscopy perform high risk group 50 year 5 10 year earliest case colorectal cancer . Optical colonoscopy important limitation : complication ( perforation , bleed ) , need use general anesthesia ( France 95 % colonoscopy perform general anesthesia ) , low acceptability screen even high risk person ( 40 % best case ) . In high risk population , potentially important place alternative method . FIT could one , already significant amount data suggest interest . No data available high risk French patient . Capsule endoscopy recent technique sparse data high risk group , prospective comparison optical colonoscopy indication . Capsule endoscopy advantage high feasibility , low risk , probably ( demonstrate ) increase acceptability , represent close examination compare colonoscopy . This justify prospective study compare randomize methodology 3 modality identification advance neoplastic lesion colon well characterize group subject high risk colorectal cancer . We propose prospective , randomize protocol non-inferiority order compare two new strategy reference strategy detection advance colorectal neoplasia ( colon rectal cancer , large adenoma &gt; 1 cm high grade dysplasia ; 1rst arm : OC first ; 2nd arm : CC first , OC 3 year patient negative initial CC ; 3rd arm : annual FIT 3 year , colonoscopy 3 year patient negative FIT study ) . The new strategy consider non-inferior reference strategy study allow conclude absolute reduction proportion detect patient , great 3 % comparison reference strategy .</detailed_description>
