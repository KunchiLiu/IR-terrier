	<brief_summary>The purpose study advance understanding natural history Rett syndrome ( RTT ) , MECP2-duplication disorder ( MECP2 Dup ) , RTT-related disorder include CDKL5 , FOXG1 , individual MECP2 mutation RTT include range clinical involvement correlate genotype-phenotype broad spectrum phenotype . While much learn RTT , improvement require understanding role factor X chromosome inactivation , genetic background , others include environment , great variability observe even individual MECP2 mutation . These data essential development conduct clinical trial anticipate ongoing study animal model RTT . This study include clinical trial , set stage trial translational research project ( e.g. , development biomarkers ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At present time , effective treatment RTT , MECP2 Dup , Rett-related disorder lack . Substantial progress make RTT past eleven year study represent narrowing focus mutation duplication MECP2 gene related disorder , include phenotypic overlap . Understanding RTT advance remarkably well Rett Syndrome Natural History Clinical Protocol ( NHS ) correspondingly advancement basic science realm move forward equivalent success . Thus , progress clinical basic science lead establishment clinical trial translational study hold promise additional clinical trial future . In process , however , additional MECP2- RTT-related disorder unknown time original proposal identify . In addition , substantial clinical variability individual RTT explain difference mutation alone must explore . In fact , variability among individual identical mutation lead search additional explanation . At time initial application ( 2002 ) , three year identification gene , MECP2 , molecular link RTT , variation clinical disorder relate MECP2 mutation related quite different MECP2 Dup unknown . Each disorder characterize significant neurodevelopmental feature relate either alteration MECP2 gene related phenotype closely resemble see individual RTT . Further , phenotypic overlap RTT due mutation CDKL5 FOXG1 also unexplored . This new study build substantial progress make understanding classic variant RTT add related disorder , MECP2 Dup Rett-related disorder include CDKL5 , FOXG1 , individual MECP2 mutation RTT . A comprehensive clinical research program perform include clinical , neurophysiologic , molecular biochemical marker across different , related disorder . This protocol address natural history component serve basis study protocol include neurophysiologic biomarker study . Thereby , study represent continue pathway focus inform ongoing also emerge clinical trial .</detailed_description>
