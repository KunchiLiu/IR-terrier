	<brief_title>Off Treatment Durability Chronic Hepatitis B With Good Immune Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment paradigm chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) transform introduction nucleoside analogue ( NA ) therapy . Long-term NA therapy suppress viral replication , improve liver histology , reduce risk liver-related complication mortality . For large majority CHB patient , NAs need take long-term , since occurrence hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) seroclearance , establish treatment endpoint CHB , rare event . Nonetheless , HBsAg seroclearance achieve , virologic suppression improvement clinical outcome remain sustained almost patient even treatment discontinuation . So far , attempt discontinue NA therapy HBsAg seroclearance yield variable result . Concerning hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) -negative CHB , prior study find rate disease relapse range 45 % 66 % treatment cessation . A recent multicenter prospective study involve three Hong Kong institute ( include center ) 184 patient find 48-week cumulative rate virologic relapse 91.4 % . While variation relapse rate could explain difference study design definition endpoint , important factor could play role serum HBsAg level recruit subject . The quantification serum HBsAg recently advocate marker disease monitoring CHB [ 10 ] . Low level serum HBsAg associate good immune control hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , serum HBsAg level 100-200 IU/mL predictive eventual HBsAg seroclearance treatment-naïve CHB . Nonetheless , abovementioned multicenter prospective study , 4.8 % 14.1 % study subject HBsAg level &lt; 100 IU/mL &lt; 200 IU/mL point treatment cessation - could explain study 's high rate disease relapse . In contrast , another study retrospective nature find low relapse rate 66 % , 27.6 % patient HBsAg level &lt; 200 IU/mL treatment cessation . Although HBsAg seroclearance establish treatment endpoint CHB , patient would still low amount intrahepatic HBV DNA . Moreover , HBsAg seroclearance via conventional assay ( HBsAg &lt; 0.05 IU/mL ) mean absence serum HBsAg , merely serum HBsAg undetectable level . Using sensitive assay , detectable HBsAg find 29.1 % 53.2 % patient . So despite continued presence HBV , off-treatment durability HBsAg seroclearance would suggest treatment cessation , viral replication viral protein production need totally absent , sufficiently low amount permit successful host immune control . Hence , relevant clinical question would : 1 . How low must serum HBsAg successful off-treatment durability ? Must `` magic figure '' 0.05 IU/mL reach ? Or could HBsAg level &gt; 0.05 - 200 IU/mL range sufficient ? This could implications drug budgeting . According data retrieve Clinical Data Analysis Reporting System ( CDARS ) , Hospital Authority , NA prescription headcount 2014 reach 36,287 prescription , estimate total drug expenditure 381 million Hong Kong dollar . A finite duration therapy certain patient could help reduction drug expenditure . Other clinical question include : 2 . Could long duration NA therapy enhance success off-treatment durability ? For many available therapy cessation study , mean NA therapy duration approximately 1.5-3 year . There emerge evidence demonstrate intrahepatic covalently close circular DNA ( cccDNA ) could actually decrease profoundly 5 year NA therapy ; low intrahepatic HBV cccDNA level could key successful off-treatment durability . 3 . Is clinical factor reliably predict off-treatment virologic relapse ? A potential novel marker hepatitis B core-related antigen ( HBcrAg ) , detect identical amino-acid sequence share HBeAg , hepatitis B core antigen 22 kDa precore protein . Serum HBcrAg level reflect level HBV disease activity [ 15 ] , predict occurrence liver-related complication , also correlate well intrahepatic HBV cccDNA level , master intrahepatic reservoir production HBV virion . Low level HBcrAg could reflect low level intrahepatic HBV cccDNA , mean good chance maintain off-treatment durability . Aims Hypotheses Tested : Primary : 1 . To determine optimal HBsAg level cessation NA therapy CHB Secondary : 2 . To determine rate virologic relapse treatment cessation CHB patient serum HBsAg level ≤200 IU/mL 3 . To determine role serum HBcrAg predict virologic relapse treatment cessation . Study Design We propose prospective observational study follow STROBE guideline follow-up study subject cessation NA 48 week . HBsAg-positive patient clinic take either entecavir tenofovir therapy test HBsAg level screen study eligibility . Those serum HBsAg level &lt; 200 IU/mL fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion list see one study investigator , would explain study objective offer option treatment discontinuation . All enrol study subject , cessation therapy , evaluate baseline , week 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 48 , liver biochemistry , alpha-fetoprotein , HBV DNA , HBsAg HBcrAg level determine clinic visit . A regular 6-week follow-up place first 24 week , since approximately 75 % virologic relapse occur first 24 week - regular monitoring allow detection relapse early stage . In addition , dedicate research assistant follow-up study subject assist monitor logistics . A telephone hotline provide study subject additional query . For every HBV DNA measurement &gt; 2,000 IU/mL , second HBV DNA measure 2 week . The primary outcome study virologic relapse , define serum HBV DNA &gt; 2,000 IU/mL 2 measurement 2 week apart , regardless serum ALT level , original NA ( entecavir tenofovir ) recommence . We choose HBV DNA &gt; 2,000 IU/mL threshold restart NA level CHB patient would need consider treatment . Secondary outcome study include : 1 . HBV DNA &lt; 200 IU/mL week 48 2 . Undetectable HBV DNA ( &lt; 20 IU/mL ) week 48 3 . HBsAg seroclearance ( &lt; 0.05 IU/mL ) week 48 NA treatment could also resume discretion study investigator base special clinical consideration , e.g . sudden diagnosis malignancy require chemotherapy . Patients always give option drop study ; nonetheless expect high dropout rate ( 3.3 % previous study ) .</detailed_description>
