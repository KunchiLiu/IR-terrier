	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Antibody-mediated humoral rejection currently critical question renal transplant recipient immunological risk factor pre transplant donor-specific anti HLA antibody ( DSA ) . The immunosuppressive management patient still well defined improve short long-term graft outcome remain challenge question . Recent experimental data suggest Belatacept could induce B cell anergy , induce regulatory B cell decrease Ig production . These finding strengthen result phase II III clinical study , show significant low incidence DSA patient treat Belatacept compare recipient receive conventional immunosuppressive regimen calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) . Primary objective incidence clinical subclinical humoral rejection ( According BANFF 2011 Criteria ) . Secondary objective include one-year graft patient survival , renal function M12 ( MDRD ) , incidence cellular rejection ( M 12 ) , level proteinuria ( M3 M12 ) DSA outcome ( outcome DSA MFI JO , M3 M12 ) . Inclusion period two year . DSA identification quantitative analysis transplantation centralize one HLA laboratory Unit ( Hospital Saint Louis ) provide result homogeneity . According previous clinical study , incidence Acute Antibody Mediated Humoral Rejection close 20 % patient mild immunological risk define presence DSA time transplant mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) 1000 3000 ( Luminex ) . In order demonstrate significant reduction ( 40 % ) AAMR sAAMR incidence , 91 patient include study . Results compare cohort match age , sex , immunological risk factor ( DSA ) , time transplant , transplant center graft similar immunosuppressive regimen include CNI instead Belatacept</brief_summary>

Target Population ) Renal transplant recipient age 18 DSA time transplant mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) 1000 3000 ( Luminex ) . 3 . Age Sex 1 . Men woman , age &gt; 18 2 . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use two adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study 8 week last dose study drug minimize risk pregnancy . WOCBP include woman experience menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Postmenopause define : Amenorrhea last 12 consecutive month without another cause , For woman irregular menstrual period take hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) , document serum folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) level great 35 mIU/mL . Women use oral contraceptive , hormonal contraceptive ( vaginal product , skin patch , implant injectable product ) , mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy , practice abstinence partner sterile ( eg , vasectomy ) consider childbearing potential . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 72 hour start investigational product . A male subject father potential must use adequate method contraception avoid conception throughout study 8 week last dose study drug minimize risk pregnancy . 4 . Sex Reproductive Status 1 . WOCBP unwilling unable use acceptable method avoid pregnancy entire study period 8 week last dose study drug . 2 . Women pregnant breastfeeding . 3 . Women positive pregnancy test . 4 . Sexually active fertile men use effective birth control partner WOCBP . 5 . Target Disease Exceptions 1 . Subjects EBVnegative whose EBV status unknown.. 2 .
