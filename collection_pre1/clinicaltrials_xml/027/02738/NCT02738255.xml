	<brief_summary>Test effect add single-use Varnum mouthpiece pharyngeal collapsibility obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) severity patient identify mouth breather . Research indicate nasal breathe may improve sleep apnea also increase circulation , blood oxygen , carbon dioxide level , slow breathe rate , improve overall lung volume . Thus , investigator test whether single-use Varnum mouthpiece improve pharyngeal collapsibility OSA severity mouth breather .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Added Varnum Mouthpiece Pharyngeal Collapsibility Sleep Apnea Severity Mouth Breathers .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common disorder remain under-treated due therapeutic option beyond continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . In patient OSA , upper airway obstruction cause collapse pharyngeal structure sleep . It known mouth breathing increase upper-airway collapsibility sleep may contribute occurrence sleep disorder breathing . In addition , show patient high percentage mouth breathe sleep less adherent CPAP therapy . Therefore , one potential solution problem use Varnum 's mouthpiece prevent mouth breathe sleep . The overall objective current study improve upper airway collapsibility sleep apnea OSA patient high percentage mouth breathe sleep . The investigator ' central hypothesis prevent lip part Varnum device reduce oral breathing thereby OSA severity mouth breather . The investigator choose hypothesis `` tap mouth close '' simple device Varnum mouthpiece straightforward approach deal common problem . With research , could become possible overcome one major problem contribute sleep apnea - mouth breathing . Therefore , investigator aim test effect Varnum mouthpiece pharyngeal collapsibility OSA severity patient identify mouth breather . The investigator ' work hypothesis device keep lip separate thereby prevent oral breathing . In , may help keep airway patent ( promote nasal instead oral breathe ) self-described mouth breather thus reduce OSA severity . On contrary , investigator believe patient identify mouth breather might benefit significantly Varnum device . The expected outcome study validation new device improve sleep apnea large subgroup easily identifiable OSA patient , namely self-described mouth breather . Such device could advance field provide effective alternative treatment .</detailed_description>
