	<brief_summary>The goal study track intraoperative change occur airways patient undergo 1 ) laparoscopic surgery Trendelenburg position , 2 ) spinal surgery prone position , well regression change postoperatively . These surgery know cause edema swell soft tissue head neck , temporarily worsen airway anatomy , little data quantify change , study investigate time course require airway return baseline extubation . This would important clinical information give airway management always major concern perioperatively . The investigator test hypothesis evaluate patient ' airway preoperatively , immediately post-extubation , regular interval thereafter use Modified Mallampati Score class ( MMS ) , patient 's airway score class 1 4 ( 4 indicate high likelihood difficult intubation ) base visibility soft palate , uvula , faucial pillar inside oral cavity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : One primary method assess airway dimension change Modified Mallampati Score ( MMS ) . MMS valuable tool assess difficulty intubation previous study simple , reproducible , reliable preoperative preanesthetic assessment oral volume . MMS evaluate ask patient open mouth protrude tongue without phonation . A score scale 1-4 assign base identifiable intraoral anatomic structure . MMS score 3 4 strongly associate difficult laryngoscopy intubation . Extensive observational research obstetric population demonstrate airway change , include increase MMS decrease oropharyngeal volume , occur labor . It find 63 % parturients experienced increase MMS course labor , fraction patient score 3 4 peak 51.7 % , compare 10.3 % early labor . Notably , patient reach class 4 , 21 % remain classification 48 hour postpartum . It find 18 % patient whose airway class worsen labor return prelabor class 36-48 hour delivery . These obstetric finding prompt limited number study investigate airway change patient undergo surgical procedure . This study focus surgery prone Trendelenburg position , would intuitively predispose patient edema fluid retention head neck . MMS increase 78 % patient , 29 % increase two class patient undergo lumbar spine surgery prone position . Furthermore , although laparoscopic surgery show increase lung chest wall mechanical impedance , lead increase abdominal intrathoracic pressure , well increase central venous pressure subsequent increase intraocular pressure , study perform specifically track resultant airway change . Lastly , investigator ' knowledge study investigate postoperative resolution airway change either type procedure . Rationale : There evidence , investigational anecdotal , airway change may occur certain surgery procedure , patient positioning may play large role precipitating . However , research phenomenon surgical population , unlike obstetric population , sparse . Similarly , investigation time require airway change regress back baseline include number obstetric airway study , surgical one . Lastly , suggest surgical factor , fluid balance procedure duration , may alter degree airway change , result recent study topic unclear . Thus , study seek investigate influence prone Trendelenburg positioning , well surgical variable , perioperative airway change , quantify time required patient ' airway return preoperative state . Based clinical observation , primary hypothesis significant difference mean score class change 2 study group preoperative baseline initial postoperative assessment . Investigators hypothesize T-burg surgery patient mean change 2 class compare mean change one class prone spine surgery patient . The secondary hypothesis airway change occur patient undergo prone procedure resolve significantly sooner ( 3 - 4 hour ) patient undergo Trendelenburg surgery ( &gt; 4 hour ) . Thirdly investigator investigate effect demographic , physiological , surgical &amp; anesthetic variable postoperative MMS change resolution .</detailed_description>
