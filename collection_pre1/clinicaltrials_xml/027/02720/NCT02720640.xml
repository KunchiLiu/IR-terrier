	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Alpha AMS Subretinal Implant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific research question , ) implant partially restore vision eye light perception ii ) safety implication ocular periorbital tissue implant eye ? In advanced RP light detect photoreceptor cell retina degenerate slowly time , may eventually lead blindness . The subretinal implant replaces degenerate photoreceptor layer stimulate residual overlie healthy retinal layer response light stimulus . These signal carry brain along normal visual pathway . Investigators seek recruit six participant fulfill eligibility criterion , include advanced RP useful light perception vision eye receive implant . Participants must age 18 70 year old , highly motivate , well enough general anaesthetic . The eye must also cataract surgery . The project conduct Oxford Eye Hospital . Those participant select receive implant follow 12 month date surgery . Between week 1 month 12 least 7 outpatient clinic visit range visual test eye assessment . After 12 month trial officially end , however investigator continue review research participant clinic would standard care patient RP . The implant may remove stage e.g . cease function participant 's request .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant willing able give inform consent participation trial . Male Female , age 18 70 year old . Hereditary retinal degeneration outer retinal layer i.e . photoreceptor rod &amp; cone . Angiography show retinal vessel adequately perfuse , despite pathological RP condition . Severe visual impairment ( least monocular ) i.e . visual function insufficient localization object , selfsustained navigation orientation e.g . impaired light localization worse . Ability read normal print earlier life , optically correct ( without magnify glass ) . Able participate study full time period one year . Pseudophakic eye receive implant . Stable dose current regular medication least four week prior trial entry . Female participant child bear potential must willing ensure partner use effective contraception trial . Participant clinically acceptable laboratory ECG result confirm Screening Visit upon review consultant anaesthetist . In Investigator 's opinion , able willing comply trial requirement . Willing allow General Practitioner consultant , appropriate , notified participation trial . Period appropriate visual function &lt; 12 year / lifetime . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) show significant retina oedema &amp; /or scar tissue within target region implant . Retina detect thin expect require functionality inner retina show via OCT . Lack innerretinal function , determine Electrically Evoked Phosphenes ( EEP ) . Heavy clump pigmentation posterior pole . Any ophthalmologic disease relevant effect upon visual function ( e.g . glaucoma , optic neuropathy , trauma , diabetic retinopathy , retinal detachment ) . Amblyopia report earlier life eye implant . Systemic disease might imply considerable risk regard surgical intervention anesthesia ( e.g . cardiovascular/ pulmonary disease , significant metabolic disease e.g . diabetes ) . Neurological and/or psychiatric disease ( e.g . Parkinson , epilepsy , depression ) . Hyperthyroidism hypersensitivity iodine . Hypersensitivity fluorescent dye ( fluorescence angiography ) . Women pregnant nursing , woman childbearing age willing use medically acceptable mean birth control duration study , woman unwilling perform pregnancy test enter study . Participation another interventional clinical trial within past 12 week . Scheduled elective surgery procedure require general anaesthesia trial . Any significant disease disorder , opinion Investigator , may either put participant risk participation trial , may influence result trial , participant 's ability participate trial .</criteria>
