	<brief_summary>Biliary tract cancer progress first line treatment difficult treat . There great need effective , tolerable , easy administer second-line regimen . Previous early phase study demonstrate combination two chemotherapy drug , irinotecan capecitabine activity set . The goal study determine whether drug combination , second-line treatment , improve progression free survival patient biliary tract cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan Capecitabine Second-line Treatment Advanced/Metastatic Biliary Tract Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current front-line treatment regimen use gemcitabine combination cisplatin significant survival benefit ( 11.7 versus 8.1 month , P &lt; 0.001 ) patient biliary tract cancer compare single agent gemcitabine . However , urgent need effective second-line regimen minimal toxicity . Capecitabine ( Xeloda ) oral pro-drug 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) . The conversion active drug dependent thymidine phosphorylase , express high level tumor cell normal tissue . There report prospective clinical trial use capecitabine cholangiocarcinoma . However , case report successful stabilization disease single agent capecitabine available . Since 5-FU main chemotherapy agent biliary tract cancer 40 year , reasonable presume overall effectiveness capecitabine similar infusional 5-FU . Several clinical trial show irinotecan good agent cholangiocarcinoma . Of five patient partial response one phase I trial combination irinotecan docetaxel advance solid tumor , one cholangiocarcinoma . Two 11 patient partial response another phase I trial use combination irinotecan , oxaliplatin 5-FU advanced tumor cholangiocarcinoma . A case report indicate single agent irinotecan give low weekly dose could produce long-lasting response metastatic cholangiocarcinoma . Based data , experience , early phase study combination , phase II trial propose determine progression free survival , response rate , overall survival , toxicity biliary tract cancer patient administer irinotecan capecitabine second-line treatment .</detailed_description>
