	<brief_summary>Resting state functional MRI widely use study brain functional network . However , in-scanner head movement non-neuronal noise disproportionately bias connectivity estimate , despite various preprocessing effort . To address issue , technique combine data acquisition multiecho ( ME ) echo planar image analysis spatial independent component analysis ( ICA ) , call ME-ICA , develop distinguish BOLD ( neuronal ) non-BOLD ( artifactual ) component base linear echo-time dependence signal , demonstrate successfully remove non-neuronal confounds . Nonetheless , research approach never apply psychiatric population . The study aim fill gap show following .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Addressing Motion Confounds Issues Resting fMRI- Application Multi-echo EPI Scanning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : 1 . To replicate feasibility efficacy multi-echo fMRI removal non-neuronal confounds show work Kundu colleague ( 2012 , 2013 ) 2 . To characterize intrinsic functional connectivity ( iFC ) differences adults attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) healthy volunteer use ME-ICA denoising method . Then compare result iFC difference derive single-echo fMRI scan , order separate `` authentic '' group differences spurious finding introduce non-neuronal confounds . 3 . To explore neural signature in-scanner motion restlessness compare intrasubject difference iFC single-echo multi-echo fMRI , inter-subject difference subject high- low- motion level . The investigator plan recruit 80 participant ( 40 adult ADHD , 40 healthy control ) , without current past history systemic physical illness , neither major psychiatric disorder ADHD . All participant receive psychiatric interview ( The Chinese Version Kiddie Epidemiologic version Schedule Affective Disorders Schizophrenia , K-SADS-E ) . They receive Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-3rd edition ( WAIS-III ) first ensure full-scale IQ great 80 . The MRI assessment ( T1 imaging , single-echo echo planar imaging ( EPI ) multi-echo EPI resting-state fMRI ) subsequently arrange within 2 week psychiatric/neuropsychological assessment . This study ( 1 ) first report Taiwan term implementation multi-echo EPI denoise ; ( 2 ) first report world functional connective difference use multi-echo EPI ; ( 3 ) provide evidence mechanism underpin in-scanner motion restless improve specificity motion biomarkers use multi-echo EPI .</detailed_description>
