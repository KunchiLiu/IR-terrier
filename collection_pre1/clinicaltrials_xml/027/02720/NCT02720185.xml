	<criteria>nEGFR positive ECOG performace status ≤1 Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL platelets ≥150,000/mcL total bilirubin &lt; 1.25x institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation 30 day final dose . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Patients receive investigational agent Patients able swallow oral medication gastrointestinal condition may impact absorption dasatinib . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition dasatinib . Patients receive medication substance moderate strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A4 ineligible . Because list agent constantly change , medication review UW Pharmacy Research Center contraindicate medication . As part enrollment/informed consent procedure , patient counsel risk interaction agent , new medication need prescribe patient consider new overthecounter medicine herbal product . H2 antagonists proton pump inhibitor allow Anticoagulants ( ie . Coumadin , heparin , antiXa inhibitor ) antiplatelet agent ( ie . aspirin ) allow . NSAIDS acetaminophen allow study . Medications know prolong QTC allow ( See Appendix B ) No history prolong QTC cardiomyopathy unless normal QTC ejection fraction confirm within 1 month prior study entry . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study dasatinib pregnancy category D agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother dasatinib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated dasatinib resume least 2 week final dose . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction dasatinib . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
