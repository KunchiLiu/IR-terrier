	<brief_summary>The purpose study collect store sample health information current future research learn cause treatment blood disease . This therapeutic diagnostic protocol clinical purpose . Blood bone marrow well health information use study learn blood disease use genetic and/or genomic research . In general , genetic research study specific gene individual ; genomic research study complete genetic makeup individual . It know many people blood disease , gene cause disease find . It also know people disease sicker others , may relate gene . By study genome individual blood disease family member , investigator hope learn disease develop respond treatment may provide new good way diagnose treat blood disease . Primary Objective : - Establish repository DNA cryopreserved blood cell link clinical information individual non-malignant blood disease biologically-related family member order conduct genomic functional study outline secondary objective . Secondary Objectives : Utilizing biorepository , investigator aim : - Identify novel mutation associate disease status individual unexplained non-malignant blood disease . - Identify modifier gene individual define monogenic non-malignant blood disease . - Identify genetic variant associate treatment outcome toxicity individual non-malignant blood disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants individual ( proband ) receive therapy expert consultation regard non-malignant hematologic disorder . A detailed medical history obtain , include demographic information proband . For identified biologically-related family member , medical history questionnaire obtain . The family history pedigree review conjunction geneticist/genetic counselor . The implication genetic testing explain . If participant consent future contact , take place annually update medical family history . All probands provide peripheral blood sample , probands undergo bone marrow aspirate/biopsy clinical purpose provide additional aspirate . Biological family member provide peripheral blood sample source DNA .</detailed_description>
