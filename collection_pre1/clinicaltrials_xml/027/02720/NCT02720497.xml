This difficult military mental health provider , large patient load pressure see many patient per day possible , limit therapy session 60 minute . The primary aim randomize clinical trial determine whether PE session reduce 60 minute without compromise treatment 's high success rate . Preliminary evidence suggest patient may greatly benefit PE even time spent recall recount trauma memory session ( key procedure call imaginal exposure ) shorten fit 60-minute session . To test hypothesis , trial enroll 160 San Antonio-area active duty service member randomly assign receive PE treatment 60- 90-minute session . In additional effort learn PE help patient recover - thereby gain insight enhance treatment benefit - study investigator examine cause reduction PTSD symptom PE examine self-reported physiological marker ( e.g. , heart rate reactivity ) two treatment group .

This would potentially help thousand nation 's warrior recover devastate psychological effect PTSD maintain military career , heal hurt relationship , reengage meaningful life activity .

In addition , insight study 's examination biomarkers underlie mechanism PE could use enhance care service member , veteran , general public . Study risk minimal , small proportion patient may see temporary symptom increase deal traumatic memory , part recovery process .
