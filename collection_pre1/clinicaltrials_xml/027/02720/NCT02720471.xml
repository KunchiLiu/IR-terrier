	<brief_summary>Clinical study , comparative , prospective , interventional , randomize , single-center , single-blind The fast resumption walk surgery total prosthesis hip ( PTH ) require effective analgesia immediate post-operative period . In France , whatever peroperative anesthesia , analgesic reference technique locoregional anesthesia ( ALR ) ultrasound guidance block femoral cutaneous nerve side thigh . In Anglo-Saxon country , particular Australia United States , technique peroperative infiltration local anesthetic ( IAL ) surgeon supplant technique traditional ALR . However , French study compare IAL conventional ALR rigorous methodology . Our occasional practice IAL suggest u effective term post-operative analgesia Analog Visual Scales decrease ( EVA ) less consumption morphine . Furthermore , resumption upright posture bipedal support well resumption walk would earlier . The main objective show post-operative analgesia local peroperative infiltration superior obtain locoregional anesthesia ( ALR femoral block associate side cutaneous block thigh ) surgery total prosthesis hip , decrease consumption morphine within first 72 post-operative hour . The secondary objective compare Analog Visual Scales pain ( EVA ) rest mobilization various time ( post-surgery care room , H4 , H8 , H12 , H24 , H48 , H72 ) , period end intervention ( operate room ) first support upright posture bipedal support ) , period end intervention resumption walk , satisfaction patient exit hospital , duration hospitalization surgical operation possible unwanted event ( systematic toxicity local anesthetic , infection prosthesis , disease thromboembolic venous ) hospitalization .</brief_summary>
