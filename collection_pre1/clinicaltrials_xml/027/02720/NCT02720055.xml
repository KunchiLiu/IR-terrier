	<brief_title>Rehabilitation Workbook After Wrist Fracture .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants A total 140 participant age 18 distal radius fracture include study . Sample Size The primary outcome use calculate sample size Disability Arm Shoulder Hand ( DASH ) Score . In pilot study sixty patient distal radius fracture evaluate 8 week follow fracture , mean DASH score 29 standard deviation 19 . A sample size 126 would therefore provide power ( 90 % ) identify true superiority intervention workbook current practice difference mean equal 10 ( recognise minimal clinically significant difference DASH ) significant 5 % level ( use one sided test ) . We anticipate drop rate 10 % therefore aim enrol 140 patient study . ( 70 arm ) . Treatment Rehabilitation Overview All patient routinely discharge Emergency Department follow application cast manipulation application cast follow orthopaedic outpatient clinic . They treat operatively cast 6 week ( treatment decision make clinical basis name consultant orthopaedic trauma surgeon responsible patient 's care ) begin mobilisation . All treatment type include study significant difference see group term patient report outcome psychological score pilot study 60 patient . Recruitment randomisation take place outpatient department 2 week follow injury . At stage patient give one workbook instruct use . Patients routinely refer physiotherapy individual patient develop complication physiotherapy clinically indicate referred stage . Patients follow 6 week 6 month follow injury . The deviation normal practice trial administration workbooks patient complete time home . In routine practice patient would follow 6 month , trial patient . Recruitment Participants recruit The Department Orthopaedics Royal Infirmary Edinburgh . Initial management patient Emergency Department orthopaedic service routine determine clinical staff involve trial . Fig 2 . The first potential contact trail staff first orthopaedic outpatient appointment 2 week injury . At time patient distal radius fracture assess clinically radiographs treat clinical team . Once establish fulfil trial inclusion criterion member research team notify trial explain patient . They give participant information sheet willing take part , research assistant consent participate trial . The number patient approach part trial , number agree number decline reason record , data anonymised time record . Recruited patient randomise one two arm : therapy base workbook intervention placebo workbook intervention . All treatment decision continue make treat clinical team . Randomisation Participants randomise routine rehabilitation plus psychological ( therapy base ) intervention workbook routine rehabilitation plus placebo ( information base ) workbook group . Randomisation stratify base age , gender operative / non-operative treatment . Patients assign group ( A-H ) base factor . See flow diagram Fig 1 . In group block randomisation carry use computer generate sequence . Block size random ( 2 , 4 6 ) sequence block also random . Blinding Participants tell compare two different rehabilitation workbook see workbook use . They give detail workbook . Both workbooks format front cover . Research team member involve take measurement clinic also blind workbook participant complete . Psychological / placebo intervention Patients complete work book rehabilitation . This begin follow 2 week follow appointment . One arm complete 'Therapy Based Psychological Intervention Workbook ' . It provide information injury , treatment expectation . It address common misconception , negative illness perception poor cop technique aim improve self efficacy . This developed collaboration Health Psychology PhD student University Strathclyde agree upon use trial . This reviewed focus group patient distal radius fracture . The consensus workbook useful informative . No objection raise workbook . The arm complete 'Placebo Workbook . This contain stretch exercise therapy base exercise exercise aim address illness perception cop technique . This placebo workbook represent current standard care Department Orthopaedics , Royal Infirmary Edinburgh . Baseline Information At 2 week follow : Information regard patient age , gender , post code , date injury , history previous fracture , mode injury , associate injury , neurovascular injury , open injury , level pain ( 11 point Likert scale 0-10 low high ) , past medical psychiatric history , current medication , smoke alcohol status , application injury compensation , dependant , drive status , employment status , education status level sport activity collect . All patient complete pre injury DASH score SF-12 . Base line Hospital anxiety Depression score ( HADS ) , Tampa scale Kinesiophobia ( TSK ) , Pain Catastrophising Score ( PCS ) , General Self Efficacy score ( SES ) , Recovery Locus Control ( RLoC ) Illness perception questionnaire - revise ( IPQ-R ) , Imaging stage include standardise plain film radiograph include antero posterior lateral view wrist . ( These radiographs routine stage treatment patient trial ) .</detailed_description>
