	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy injectable drug cabotegravir ( CAB LA ) , pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) HIV-uninfected cisgender men transgender woman sex men ( MSM TGW ) . This study enroll HIV-uninfected MSM TGW risk acquire HIV infection . Participants remain study 1.5 year 4.5 year , depend enroll study . This study take place three step . Participants randomly assign one two arm : Arm A : Step 1 : Participants receive daily oral CAB tablet daily oral TDF/FTC placebo tablet 5 week . Step 2 : Participants receive intramuscular ( IM ) injection CAB LA two time point 4 week apart every 8 week thereafter daily oral TDF/FTC placebo tablet . Arm B : Step 1 : Participants receive daily oral TDF/FTC tablet daily oral CAB placebo tablet 5 week . Step 2 : Participants receive daily oral TDF/FTC tablet IM injection placebo two time point 4 week apart every 8 week thereafter . In Step 3 , participant ( Arms A B ) receive daily oral TDF/FTC tablet later 8 week last injection , 48 week . Participants attend 57 study visit throughout study . Visits may include physical examination , blood collection , urine collection , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , rectal swab collection . Some participant may bone mineral density-energy x-ray absorptimetry ( DXA ) scan select visit . All participant transition locally available HIV prevention service , include service PrEP , available , end participation study .</detailed_description>
