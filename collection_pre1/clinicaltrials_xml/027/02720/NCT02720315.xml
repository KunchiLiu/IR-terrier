	<detailed_description>Background Acute musculoskeletal ( MSK ) injury , include strain , sprain contusion , common reason patient seek emergency care . Pain control essential component treatment . Within orthopedic literature , robust body research support use cryotherapy post-operative patient injured athlete . However , within emergency department ( ED ) , study focus pharmacologic analgesia . The absence evidence optimal method impact ice therapy acute MSK injuries contribute inconsistent practice pattern may impede symptom control increase narcotic usage . Objectives The specific aim ICED investigation evaluate effectiveness intensive cryotherapy treatment pain due acute MSK injury treat ED . Secondary outcome include length-of-stay ( LOS ) , patient satisfaction , narcotic usage . Methods Adults young sixty-six years-old presenting ED acute MSK pain enrol process inform consent , unless one exclusion criterion meet . Crushed ice double-bagged apply site injury , wrap place twenty minute . Pain score measure use visual analog scale ( VAS ) ice apply , 20 minute , 60 minute , 48 hour +/- 12 hour via follow-up text message , time patient satisfaction measure use two applicable question Press-Ganey survey : pain control ; likelihood recommend . Treating physician alter management . Data LOS use pharmacologic analgesic obtain chart review . Results Change VAS analyze regression analysis analysis variance . Patients group category pharmacologic analgesic usage . Patient satisfaction score narcotic usage analyze use Chi Square test , LOS data compare unpaired two-tailed t-test .</detailed_description>
