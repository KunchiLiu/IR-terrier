	<detailed_description>Acute postoperative pain poorly treat . More three-quarters patient complain pain , moderate extreme , surgery . In orthopedic surgery , continuous nerve block analgesia prove effective among in-hospital patient single injection strategy easier implement grow outpatient setting . The main objective study compare efficacy continuous nerve block single injection term perioperative patient satisfaction schedule orthopedic ambulatory surgery . Subgroup analyse perform , priori , accord patient Pain Catastrophizing Scale ( PCS ) type surgery . Secondary objective comprise assessment pain , readmission rate , patient mobilization , quality sleep heart rate collect activity tracker . Scales quality recovery perform day 1 , quality life day 45 presence neuropathic pain screen 3 month . An economic study also conduct , include work resumption 3 month . The inclusion criterion adult undergo outpatient schedule orthopedic surgery general anesthesia regional analgesia . Non-inclusion criterion patient 80 year , document cognitive impairment , inability complete self-administered questionnaire , present American Society Anesthesiology ( ASA ) physical status 3 unsteady 4 , spontaneously require analgesic perineural catheter single injection local anesthetic . This multicentric prospective study . Three hundred patient randomize two parallel group : continuous nerve block deliver thru remote-controlled electronic pump versus single local anesthetic injection . The primary endpoint EVAN-G patient satisfaction scale , score day 2 .
