	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy Combined With Concurrent Chemotherapy Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing biological effective dose ( BED ) radiotherapy non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) increase local control rate improve overall survival . Compared conventional fractionate radiotherapy , accelerate hypofractionated radiotherapy yield high BED , shorten total treatment time , theoretically obtain good efficacy . However , currently , optimal hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen . Based phase I trial result , perform phase II trial evaluate safety preliminary efficacy accelerate hypofractionated three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy ( 3-DCRT ) combine concurrent chemotherapy patient unresectable stage III NSCLC . Patients previously untreated unresectable stage III NSCLC receive 3-DCRT total dose 69 Gy , deliver 3 Gy per fraction , daily , five fraction per week , complete within 4.6 week . At time , platinum doublet chemotherapy apply .</detailed_description>
