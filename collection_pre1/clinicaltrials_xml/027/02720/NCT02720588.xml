	<brief_title>Investigating Neuroimaging Endophenotypes Autism Spectrum Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder , yet search gene definitive role etiology remain elusive . Deconstructing disorder endophenotypic approach boost statistical power genetic study clarify pathophysiology autism . Neuroimaging data provide evidence atypical trajectory brain growth ASD , result difference neuroanatomy connectivity widespread neural system . As genetic factor responsible significant amount variation neuroanatomy intrinsic functional connectivity , share alteration brain morphology associate functional connectivity individual ASD unaffected sibling likely useful endophenotype . Nonetheless , multi-modal approach never test study endophenotypic marker ASD . The study aim fill gap . The investigator plan recruit 90 participant ( 30 adult ASD , 30 unaffected sibling , 30 healthy control ) , without current past history systemic physical illness , neither major psychiatric disorder ASD . All participant receive psychiatric interview ( Chinese version Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised , ADI-R ; Chinese Version Kiddie Epidemiologic version Schedule Affective Disorders Schizophrenia , K-SADS-E ) . They receive Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-3rd edition ( WAIS-III ) first ensure full-scale IQ great 70 . The MRI assessment ( T1 imaging , single-echo echo planar imaging ( EPI ) resting-state fMRI ) subsequently arrange within 2 week psychiatric/neuropsychological assessment . The investigator anticipate study ( 1 ) first report Taiwan report neuroimaging endophenotypes ASD ; ( 2 ) first report world share structural functional connective difference ASD unaffected sibling ; ( 3 ) provide evidence mechanism underpin broad autism phenotype .</detailed_description>
