	<brief_summary>Specific Aims : 1 . To generate induced-pluripotent stem cell ( iPSCs ) peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) isolate whole blood ASD probands healthy control . 2 . To derive neural progenitor cell ( NPCs ) neuron iPSCs ASD probands healthy control compare difference patient healthy control investigate cellular phenotype ASD uncover pathophysiology disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ASD-specific Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Disease Modeling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism spectrum disorder ( ASDs ) common , lifelong impair childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder clinical genetic heterogeneity . The etiology ASD complicate remain largely unknown . Evidences indicate high heritability ( 54-77 % ) ASD , researcher also find copy number variation ( CNVs ) play important role etiology ASD . However , due ethical issue , researcher n't appropriate platform investigate copy number change effect date . In follow study , researcher go derive ASD-specific induce pluripotent stem cell neuron disease model . 10 ASD patient 10 healthy control include present study iPSCs neuron generate PBMCs . Electrophysiological record analysis neuronal morphology conduct reveal cellular phenotype ASD comparing difference patient healthy control . The study provide platform reveal etiology genetic basis molecular mechanism ASD . The cellular phenotype ASD reveal compare difference patient healthy control . The finding work expect contribute basic clinical research ASD .</detailed_description>
