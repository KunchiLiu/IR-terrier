	<brief_summary>`` Poor corneal epithelialization problem '' find lot ocular surface disorder , include limbal insufficiency , dry eye , chemical burn neurotrophic disorder . Delayed corneal epithelialization circumstance lead corneal infection , corneal melting , corneal opacity , pain blur vision . It thus important develop pharmacological method promote corneal epithelial wound heal patient . Previously , various epitheliotrophic growth factor , autologous serum , cord blood serum , etc . prove effective promote corneal epithelial wound healing . However , topical agent drawback include difficulty preparation , expensive price , non-standardized quality risk contamination preparation . It clinically important find blood derivative effective , convenient use , stable quality cheap . During recent year , various '' platelet relate blood derivative '' prove contain lot epitheliotrophic growth factor , promote wound heal . Among product , `` platelet lysate '' benefit commercially available . It avoid complicate produce procedure , stable quality . Although platelet lysate widely use various medical field , especially culture mesenchymal stem cell , potential promoting corneal epithelial wound heal proven . The purpose project explore possibility use platelet lysate treat patient poor corneal epithelialization problem , compare epitheliotrophic ability blood derivative . The cultured human corneal epithelial cell line use experiment , culture medium contain different blood product : ( 1 ) control group without blood derivative , ( 2 ) fetal bovine serum , ( 3 ) human serum , ( 4 ) platelet lysate commercial product—UltraGro , ( 5 ) platelet lysate commercial product -- -PlatMax . MTS assay use measure proliferation ability . `` Scratch-induced directional wounding assay '' `` Boyden chamber chemotaxis assa '' use measure cell migration . Scanning electron microscopy , transmission electron microscopy , transepithelial electric resistance ( TEER ) immunohistochemistry junctional protein use measure cellular differentiation . Through experiment , investigator aim understand whether platelet lysate replace blood derivative , use treat patient corneal epithelialization problem . Beside , current medication dry eye manufacture , transport used form liquid form . However , disturb transporting , commercialize , store limitation expiration date current medication compare powder form medication . Therefore , improve convenience utilizing storage without expense efficacy blood-derivatives become critical issue . Our study also aim try produce platelet-related derivative ( include platelet lysate ) human serum form dry powder resuspend preservative-free artificial tear . The investigator would compare epitheliotrophic ability liquid form blood derivative powder form blood derivative . Since human serum need comparison , investigator propose IRB collect human serum healthy volunteers。</brief_summary>
