	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Small bowel endoscopy undergone paradigm shift past decade . Prior , small bowel consider 'black hole ' due inability visualize endoscopically limited sensitivity radiologic study . This change development capsule endoscopy , give physician ability visualize full length small bowel . Although widely consider great leap forward , video capsule endoscopy limited inability perform form endoscopic intervention . Thus , something need biopsy treat abnormality detect capsule endoscopy . Double balloon enteroscopy ( DBE ) invent Japan 2001 . Using overtube two inflatable balloon , DBE enable deep intubation small bowel series push pull maneuver accordion small bowel overtube . This procedure prove highly successful diagnosis treatment small bowel disease . Subsequently , single balloon enteroscopy ( SBE ) develop consist single overtube balloon . Collectively , technique call balloon assist enteroscopy . Balloon assist enteroscopy perform use antegrade ( mouth ) retrograde ( anus ) approach . The two approach consider complimentary since antegrade approach enable visualization proximal mid small bowel distal portion see retrograde approach . Complete enteroscopy , visualization entire small intestine , occur antegrade enteroscopy perform tattoo left depth maximal insertion reach subsequent retrograde procedure . Although consider gold standard enteroscopy , rarely achieve outside expert centre Japan . The reason loop formation small intestine , commonly refer looping ( Figure 1 ) . Looping typically worsen depth insertion increase eventually prevent forward migration enteroscope . Looping unique enteroscopy common problem encounter colonoscopy . During colonoscopy , loop remove , pull back torqueing colonoscope . However , loop often reform colonoscope push forward . To counter problem , colonoscope develop adjustable stiffness change procedure ( Olympus Inc. , Tokyo , Japan ) . Using feature , loop remove colonoscope stiffen prior push forward prevent loop reformation . Although variable stiffness available colonoscope , technology incorporate enteroscopes due much thin diameter . Recently , enteroscopy stiffen wire develop Zutron Medical LLC ( Kansas , USA ) . This scope wire insert needed increase stiffness enteroscope . In theory , improve performance DBE/SBE translate deeper insertion although never investigate . The objective randomized clinical trial answer question . STUDY DESIGN This single centre randomize clinical trial assess whether stiffen wire increase depth maximal insertion DBE/SBE . Due nature procedure , blind endoscopist impossible . This even placebo wire use , enteroscope feel sufficiently different enable unmasking . To mitigate risk bias , enteroscopy record outcome assess blinded fashion use recorded video . Randomization block vary size perform use sequentially label sealed envelope . STUDY INTERVENTION 1 . After fast overnight , sedation give start procedure . This consist either Propofol administer anesthetist midazolam fentanyl administer endoscopist . 2 . The enteroscope insert mouth , esophagus , though stomach , duodenum . 3 . Once small bowel , series push pull maneuver use previously describe ( 1 ) . Each set maneuver call cycle . 4 . Cycles repeat loop prevents forward movement depth maximal insertion reach . In study , depth maximal insertion 1 define lack forward movement 3 consecutive cycle . 5 . When depth maximal insertion 1 reach , small mark make wall small bowel suck mucosa enteroscope ( ie . suction mark ) use biopsy forceps create 3 mm disruption mucosa . A virtual mark also make endoscopy video . 6 . Those randomized stiffening wire insert wire attempt proceed deep . The technique cycle step 3 change presence wire . 7 . Those randomized stiffening wire attempt proceed deep use standard technique . 8 . The procedure continue forward movement 3 consecutive cycle . If enteroscope able proceed past depth maximal insertion 1 , suction/biopsy forceps mark make virtual mark record endoscopy video denote depth maximal insertion 2 . If enteroscope able proceed past depth maximal insertion 1 , mark make . 9 . On withdrawal enteroscope , care take endoscopist ensure suction/biopsy forceps mark clearly visible video .</detailed_description>
