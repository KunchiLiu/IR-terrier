	<detailed_description>Premature rupture membrane ( PROM ) common occurrence occur incidence 8-10 % birth . Since duration delivery important avoiding risk complication , several study perform order understand prefer way manage condition PROM woman active labor . In large random study perform 20 year ago , find advantage labor induction oxytocin labor induction Prostaglandin waiting . However , important component - BISHOP score , affect decision labor induction way , report take consideration . Therefore , aim study compare randomly perinatal outcome woman PROM low BISHOP woman undergo labor induction Oxytocin woman undergo labor induction Prostaglandin E2 .</detailed_description>
