	<detailed_description>Perinatal stroke constitutes acute presentation encephalopathy ; manifest seizure , alter mental status , and/or neurological deficit ; birth twenty-eight postnatal day pattern ischemic brain injury arterial distribution evident neuroimaging . Following perinatal stroke , approximately 60 % child develop cerebral palsy ( usually present spastic hemiplegia ) , 30-60 % experience epilepsy , 25 % show language delay , 22 % manifest behavioral problem . The current predictive tool early diagnosis CP combination brain MRI/cUS general movement ( GM ) assessment fidgety period ( 9 ) . Asymmetry fidgety GMs around 12 week post term first clinical sign hemiplegia . There currently two intensive therapy approach aim improve upper limb performance adult child ( average age 8 year ) establish hemiplegic CP : constraint induce movement therapy ( CIMT ) Hand-arm bimanual intensive training ( HABIT ) . Those current therapy approach fundamentally comprise repeat practice desire movement base motor learn principle adult/ child active participant . Both therapy , adult child establish hemiplegic CP ( average age 8 year ) effective show similar improvement dosage therapy similar . In contrast , feasibility effect therapy approach young age ( age 1 year ) still unknown ( 22 ) . Exploring option treat even asymmetric hand use appear interesting promising enough since recent animal study demonstrate critical period motor system plasticity , activity-dependent reorganization motor-projection pattern hand occur 1 year age</detailed_description>
