	<brief_title>VIT-ARMin Virtual , Intensified Patient-tailored Robotic Arm Therapy With Exoskeleton Robot ARMin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurological patient ( e.g. , stroke ) need long-term neurorehabilitative therapy arm often limit , unsatisfactory outcome . Robots become promising supplement even alternative neurorehabilitative training . Investigators aim develop unique intensified patient-tailored robot-aided training strategy arm . The exoskeleton robot ARMin develop adapt software component accordingly . The goal enhance treatment efficacy extent improvement motor function meaningful individual patient . It intensify different strategy evaluate alone combination . These strategy include : strength train error-amplification strategy increase number repetition multisensory feedback multiplayer approach</detailed_description>
