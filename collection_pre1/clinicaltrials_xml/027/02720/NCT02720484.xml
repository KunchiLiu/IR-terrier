	<brief_summary>The primary objective ass overall response rate nivolumab patient metastatic locally advanced adrenocortical carcinoma . Nivolumab recently approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment advanced melanoma , non-small cell lung cancer renal cell carcinoma . It consider investigational treatment advance refractory adrenocortical carcinoma . `` Investigational '' mean drug approve USFDA approve indication investigation . Nivolumab could shrink adrenocortical carcinoma could also cause side effect . Researchers hope learn study drug shrink cancer hopefully relieve symptom related cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall response rate nivolumab patient metastatic locally advanced adrenocortical carcinoma ( ACC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression free survival define time date first nivolumab infusion date death evidence progression disease assess compute tomography ( CT ) image every 8 week accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria 1.1 . II . To assess overall survival define time date first nivolumab infusion death patient metastatic locally advanced ACC . III . To assess safety tolerability profile nivolumab describe number , frequency , severity adverse event accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0.3 assess every 2 week patient therapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall response rate , progression free survival overall survival accord tumor program cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) program cell death 1 ligand 2 ( PD-L2 ) expression . II . To assess overall response rate , progression free survival overall survival accord serum interleukin level peripheral T cell profile level . III . To measure humoral cellular response tumor antigens serum sample measure level cytokine ( ie , interleukin [ IL ] -2 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-18 , interferon [ IFN ] gamma tumor necrosis factor [ TNF ] -alpha ) peripheral blood lymphocyte phenotype . OUTLINE : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
