	<brief_summary>Breathlessness overwhelming symptom affect ten thousand Australians every day . For many people , persists even underlie cause optimally manage ( chronic breathlessness ) . In circumstance , often occur rest minimal exertion . Evidence number clinical study suggest small , regular dose morphine help reduce safely sensation breathlessness . However , well establish patient derive benefit net clinical effect treatment ( weigh benefit harm ) . This phase III , multi-site , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) severe chronic breathlessness explore several important question : - Are regular , low dos morphine four possible dos 3 week effective placebo improve breathlessness ? - Does increase dose people already experience benefit provide even great reduction bad breathlessness ? - Does medication effect daily activity quality life ? - What common serious side effect intervention ? - Does benefit medication outweigh side effect produce ? - Are specific characteristic people likely receive benefit extend release morphine ? Participants receive daily extend release morphine ( plus laxative , docusate senna ) , placebo ( placebo laxative ) addition usual medication 3 week increase dos . Participants medical interview physical examination collect general health information , baseline measurement include ; daily activity , symptom , quality life . A small amount blood may require check eligibility . Further blood sample may take week 1 3 enable test individual respond opioids , consent obtain sample . Data benefit , side effect , medical care collect comprehensive weekly visit . Participants also fill simple diary twice daily week one three study , one day week optional 3 month extension stage . The outcome study may enable good management symptoms activity people COPD medicine show effective safe .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Three hundred thousand ( 300,000 ) Australians breathless rest minimal exertion , often year , despite optimal treatment underlie cause ( ) . This include 70,000 people breathless leave home often long periods time . Underlying cause severe ongoing breathlessness include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , interstitial lung disease , heart failure , neurodegenerative disease motor neurone disease cachexia cause . The prevalence chronic refractory breathlessness continue increase population age chronic progressive disease breathlessness common increase prevalence . Nearly one half people experience distress breathlessness last year life . The American Thoracic Society define breathlessness `` subjective experience breathe discomfort consist qualitatively distinct sensation vary intensity '' . Internationally , medication register symptomatic reduction chronic refractory breathlessness despite recommendation American Thoracic Society , American College Physicians , Canadian Thoracic Society American College Chest Physicians regular , low-dose morphine evidence-based pharmaceutical option . Aim : To enhance evidence base pharmacological treatment chronic refractory breathlessness use potential therapy compare placebo . Primary objective : To compare difference net clinical effect ( benefit harm ) chronic refractory breathlessness people chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) baseline breathlessness 3 4 modify Medical Research Council breathlessness scale ( mMRC ) take daily , extended release oral morphine two different dos compare placebo . Co-primary objective : To compare difference step per day measure use FitbitR people take daily , extended release oral morphine , dose level . Secondary objective 1 . Is regular , low dose extend release oral morphine safe , include dose titrate upwards , population people refractory breathlessness COPD ? 2 . Do people whose breathlessness help regular , low dose extend release oral morphine get additional benefit increase dose morphine ? 3 . Over period time benefit continue increase dose level benefit achieve ? 4 . What percentage people derive clinically significant benefit four dosing level , placebo ? 5 . At low dos , evidence benefit last full 24 hour ? ( end-of-dose failure ) 6 . Can predict response , benefit side effect baseline demographic clinical data people get morphine ? 7 . Does treatment breathlessness regular , low dose morphine effect general health status quality life ? 8 . Is difference activity daily live treat regular , low dose extend release oral morphine compare placebo . 9 . Assess effect treatment anxiety depression . 10 . Understand long term benefit side effect extend release morphine people COPD compare placebo . 11 . Do participant , still blind , preference end three week study ? 12 . Do caregiver notice change burden challenge caregiving person care receive regular , low dose , extend release oral morphine chronic breathlessness ? 13 . Do participant experience withdrawal opioids end study study medication cease ? Sub-studies 1 . Identify pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic parameter may help predict individual achieve great benefit week one therapy ( 8mg/day , 16mg/day ) . 2 . Identify pharmacogenomic variation opioid receptor signal may help predict clinical response ( benefit , side effect response ) . 3 . Study effect sleep people participate study 4 . Compare impact simulate drive sub-group participant use commercially available drive simulator 5 . Compare caregiver self-efficacy end week one three group compare baseline . 6 . Compare within trial incremental cost cost effectiveness therapy 7 . Evaluate change total testosterone baseline end three month extension . Null hypothesis # 1 : In people COPD refractory breathlessness , difference bad breathlessness intensity previous 24 hour addition regular , low dose oral extend release morphine compare placebo . Alternative hypothesis # 1 : The addition regular , low dose oral extend release morphine reduces intensity bad breathlessness previous 24 hour people COPD chronic breathlessness . Null hypothesis # 2 : In people COPD refractory breathlessness , difference number step take day addition regular , low dose oral extend release morphine compare placebo . Alternative hypothesis # 2 : The addition regular , low dose oral extend release morphine increase people 's activity people COPD chronic breathlessness . Study design : A five stage , national , multi-site , double-blind , parallel arm , block randomise , placebo control , factorial , dose increment phase III study opioids chronic refractory breathlessness people COPD : Stage 0 - baseline ( 2 day ) ; Stage 1 - randomisation # 1 ( 1 week ) ; Stage 2 - randomisation # 2 ( 1 week ) ; Stage 3 - randomisation # 3 ( 1 week ) ; Stage 4 - optional blind extension arm ( 3 month ) . Stage 0 . Baseline assessment : All consent participant complete 2 full day baseline diary ( even ) order become accustom complete diary regularly provide stable baseline data regard breathlessness , symptoms activity ( measure FitBitÂ® ) . At completion 2 day , participant review , complete remain baseline assessment ( questionnaire , measure baseline safety data ) , eligible randomise first time . Time period : Two full day ( 4 diary entry ) Stage 1 . Randomisation # 1 : Randomisation mane orally : placebo OR 8mg extended release morphine OR 16mg extend release morphine . Daily diary . A FitBit worn week . Participants randomise extended release morphine also receive blind docusate sennosides , randomise placebo receive identical laxative placebo . This primary outcome ( end point ) study . Time period : 1 week Stage 2 . Randomisation # 2 : While continue arm assign Stage 1 , add randomisation mane orally : placebo OR 8mg extended release morphine . Daily diary . Participants randomise placebo Stage 1 extend release morphine Stage 2 blind docusate sennosides replace laxative placebo . Time period : 1 week Stage 3 . Randomisation # 3 : While continue arm assign Stages 1 2 , add third randomisation mane orally : placebo OR 8mg extended release morphine . Daily diary . A FitBit worn week . Participants randomise placebo Stages 1 2 extended release morphine Stage 3 blind docusate sennosides replace laxative placebo . Time period : 1 week Stage 4 . Extension ( optional individual participant ) : Continue double blind medication Stages 1 , 2 3 three month . Diary one day week . A blood test end three month take total testosterone level . Time period : 3 month . Target population : This study people optimally treat chronic breathlessness ( modified Medical Research Council Scale ( mMRC ) 3 4 ) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Primary outcome assessment : Change bad intensity breathlessness previous 24 hour morning , measure use 11 point Numerical Rating Scale , record even diary entry participant . Significance : The study answer several practical question include whether regular , low dose extend release oral morphine delivers net benefit people COPD reduce breathlessness exertion ( bad breathlessness 24 hour period ) steady state ; whether dose increase beyond initial response provide great net benefit ; pattern symptomatic response day successful titration ; proportion people derive clinically meaningful symptomatic benefit dose level . Analysis plan : All analysis conduct intention-to-treat basis . Missing data impute use multiple imputation 50 resamples draw . The primary comparison study power end week 1 : placebo compare 8mg extended release morphine daily ; placebo compare 16mg extended release morphine daily . Change breathlessness first week group evaluate use random effect mixed model . Sample size calculation All calculation assume Type I ( family wise error rate ( FWER ) ) error rate 5 % Type II error rate 20 % ( power 80 % ) respectively . The primary analysis comprise two comparison make end week 1 ( placebo compare 8mg placebo compare 16mg ) , assess alpha = 0.025 ( two-sided ) protect overall type 1 error rate . Using variance-covariance matrix mean response data arise MOP study , find simulation ( n = 1000 ) use mixed model analysis 8 day , 45 subject per group require detect difference 1.09 NRS unit standard deviation day vary 2.0 2.5 NRS unit . The second family comprise one comparison , involve subject improve 1.09 NRS unit receive give dose vs. . Based 38 per group need . Using dataset 52 % active group improve least amount . For total sample N , N/3 subject receive 0mg , 8mgand 16mg week 1 . In control arm ( 0mg ) response end first week . For N/6 subject receive 8mg start week 2 , N/6*0.52 expect respond . In arm receiving 8mg , N/3*0.52 expect respond end first week . Of N/3*0 .48 n't respond first week 52 % expect respond end second week . The situation pertain group receive 16mg start week 1 . For sample 135 subject imply 82 total expect respond . Assuming equal number randomise receive next incremental dose remain dose provide 80 % power . Allowing 20 % attrition require total sample size 171 subject .</detailed_description>
