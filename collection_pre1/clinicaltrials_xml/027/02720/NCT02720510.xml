	<brief_summary>This multicenter , open-label , randomized phase II study enroll 112 newly diagnose symptomatic multiple myeloma patient 1:1 fashion . Patients enrol approximately 20 center United States . Patients undergo stem cell mobilization plerixafor plus Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor ( G-CSF ) , accord investigator discretion , 4 cycle induction therapy . Study treatment interruption stem cell collection may exceed 30 day . All patient receive one additional cycle study treatment stem cell collection proceed autologous transplant use melphalan 200mg/m2 ( 140mg/m2 patient &gt; 70 year ) , condition . After Autologus Stem Cell Transplant ( ASCT ) , patient still study initiate maintenance therapy within 60-120 day period follow ASCT , provide adequate blood count clinical recovery . Patients RVD arm initiate maintenance therapy lenalidomide alone , patient RVD-panobinostat arm receive lenalidomide + panobinostat maintenance . Lenalidomide dose orally 10mg/day continuously arm , increase 15mg/day first 84 day cycle . Panobinostat dose 10mg three time week , every week . Total planned duration maintenance therapy 3 year . Patients remain study treatment complete maintenance phase , experience disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , discretion Investigator .</brief_summary>
