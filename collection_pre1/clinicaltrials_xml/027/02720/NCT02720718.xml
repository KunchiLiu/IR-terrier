	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE Obesity Excess weight obesity fifth lead risk factor global death ( WHO 2011 ) . It demonstrate conservative treatment obesity , restrict calorie intake , increase physical activity , medical treatment , succeed achieve significant long-lasting loss weight ( Flegal 2002 ) . Therefore , bariatric surgery consider effective long-term treatment morbid obesity achieve substantial sustainable weight loss ( Fisher 2002 ) . Gastric bypass Gastric bypass two-way effect : restricts much food stomach hold ( restrictive ) affect food calorie absorb bloodstream ( malabsorptive ) . This combination surgery high success rate amount weight loss . Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass one best surgical procedure , since achieves excellent long-term result low complication rate ( Schauer 2003 , Suter 2011 , Fisher 2002 ) . During procedure two anastomose - gastrojejunal jejunojejunal -are construct . This achieve handsewn suture mechanical stapling ( Gonzalez 2003 ) . If anastomosis staple linear technique , close enterotomy suture still require . This complex time-consuming procedure laparoscopy , mainly due difficulty knot suture limit work area ( De Blasi 2013 ) . Knotless suture Barbed suture may enhance suture procedure eliminate need knot tie minimize help need assistant . However , limited number study examine use barbed suture gastric bypass procedure ( De Blasi 2013 , Facy 2013 , Costantino 2013 , Milone 2013 ) . The aim study compare safety efficacy knotless barb suture traditional continuous suture close gastrojejunal jejunojejunal anastomosis linear staple obese patient undergo gastric bypass . 2 . OBJECTIVES The aim study compare safety efficacy knotless barb suture ( Stratafix Unidirectional ) traditional continuous suture ( Vicryl ) close gastrojejunal jejunojejunal anastomosis obese patient undergo gastric bypass . 3 . STUDY DESIGN This prospective randomized study . Patients include enrolled study write informed consent . Then , participant randomly assign one two group : - Traditional suture group ( Vicryl , 2/0 ) - Knotless suture group ( Stratafix Unidirectional , 2/0 ) Randomization realize seal envelope accord computer-generated sequence random number , open surgeon start anastomosis . The surgical procedure standardize laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgeon position patient legs . During surgery gastrojejunal jejunojejunal anastomosis perform linear stapler ( Echelon 60 EndopathTM ) close traditional ( Vicryl ) knotless ( Stratafix Unidirectional ) suture . The surgeon , experience specialized laparoscopic gastric bypass technique , perform procedure , support 1 assistant 1 research nurse . 4 . STUDY POPULATION 4.1 Population ( base ) Two hundred patient undergo laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass AZ St. Dimpna Geel ( Belgium ) . 4.2 Sample size We choose sample size 200 patient ( 100 group ) . Current literature show feasible amount participant kind study . 5 . METHODS 5.1 Study parameters/endpoints The primary outcome measure rate anastomosis-related complication ( leakage , bleeding , gastric fistula , anastomotic stenosis ) group : - At 4 week post-op : short-term safety - At 6 month post-op : long-term safety The secondary outcome measure time spend close anastomosis ( efficacy ) , measure first needle last knot ( Vicryl ) last stitch ( Stratafix ) : - Gastrojejunal anastomosis - Jejunojejunal anastomosis Furthermore , register follow co-founders : - Length hospital stay - Total procedure time - Primary secondary gastric bypass procedure - Age - Gender - BMI - ASA score ( American Society Anaesthesiology ) - Co-morbidities ( e.g . diabetes ) 5.2 Randomisation , blind treatment allocation Then , participant randomly assign one two group : traditional suture group knotless suture group . Randomization realize seal envelope accord computer-generated sequence random number , open surgeon start anastomosis . 5.3 Study procedure Patients include enrol study write informed consent . The surgical procedure standardize laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass use five-port-site technique ( 2 x 12 mm ; 3 x 5 mm ) , follow step : - Division stomach : 1 . Horizontally use 60-mm regular linear stapler blue cartridge ( Echelon 60 ENDOPATHTM Stapler Ethicon , Endo-Surgery ) 2 . Vertically use two 60-mm regular linear stapler blue cartridge ( Echelon 60 ENDOPATHTM Stapler Ethicon , Endo-Surgery ) reach angle His - Gastrojejunal anastomosis : 1 . A 60-cm ileal loop lift pouch anastomosis perform use 20 mm 60-mm regular linear stapler blue cartridge ( Echelon 60 ENDOPATHTM Stapler Ethicon , Endo-Surgery ) 2 . Single-layer continuous suture ( Vicryl 2/0 Stratafix ) close anastomosis - Jejunojejunal anastomosis : 1 . The Roux limb measure 100 cm ( patient BMI &lt; 50 ) 150 cm ( patient BMI &gt; 50 ) . The anastomosis perform use 60-mm regular linear stapler white cartridge ( Echelon 60 ENDOPATHTM Stapler Ethicon , Endo-Surgery ) 2 . Single-layer continuous suture ( Vicryl 2/0 Stratafix ) close anastomosis - Completion bowel division use 60-mm regular linear stapler white cartridge ( Echelon 60 ENDOPATHTM Stapler Ethicon , Endo-Surgery ) Afterwards , mesentery defect Petersen 's defect close use monofilament non-absorbable suture ( Prolene 20 ) . De port site close . Patients evaluate 4 week 6 month surgery check complication . 5.4 Withdrawal individual subject Subjects leave study time reason wish without consequence . The investigator decide withdraw subject study urgent medical reason . 6 . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 6.1 Descriptive statistic Subject characteristic ( age , BMI , co-morbidities ) describe mean Â± standard error mean group . Gender describe percentage woman group . 6.2 Statistical analysis All data analyze use SPSS statistical software . Continuous variable compare amongst two group mean independent Student 's t-test : - Gastrojejunal anastomosis time - Jejunojejunal anastomosis time - Total procedure time - Length hospital stay - Age - BMI - ASA score Categorical variable compare mean chi-squared test : - Complication rate - Primary secondary gastric bypass - Gender - Co-morbidities A P-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
