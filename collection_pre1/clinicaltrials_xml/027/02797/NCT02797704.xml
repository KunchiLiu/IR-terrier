	<brief_title>Subconjunctival Aflibercept ( EYLEA® ) Treatment Corneal Neovascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An interruption equilibrium proangiogenic antiangiogenic factor usually nonvascularized cornea cause new corneal vessel sprout , interfere corneal clarity essential maintain normal vision . Treating neovascularized often scarred cornea remain highly challenging loss immunologic privilege avascular cornea make poor candidate corneal transplantation . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) key cytokine development normal blood vessel vessel tumor tissue undergo abnormal angiogenesis . In cornea , VEGF one several know mediator neovascularization . In recent year , anti-VEGF compound extensively investigate use prevention treatment neovascularization many tissue , include cornea . Experimental model clinical study report promising result anti-VEGF compound bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) ranibizumab ( Lucentis® ) . Aflibercept VEGF-Trap molecule . It high affinity VEGF blocker study date . Aflibercept approve United States Europe treatment macular degeneration trade name Eylea® treatment metastatic colorectal cancer trade name Zaltrap® . It find offer prolong potentially potent anti-VEGF effect wet age-related macular degeneration bevacizumab ranibizumab . Aflibercept 's safety proven indication . A preliminary study rat model recently conduct group demonstrate subconjunctival ( SC ) injection topical administration aflibercept efficiently prevent corneal neovascularization compare bevacizumab . The aim present study determine aflibercept 's efficacy treatment corneal neovascularization human . Goal : To prospectively evaluate influence single subconjunctival aflibercept injection regression corneal neovascularization . Design Clinical Follow-up : A prospective study , include patient various corneal pathology complicate corneal neovascularization . Twenty patient corneal neovascularization candidate anti VEGF treatment ( discretion corneal specialist ) include study . The patient treat single subconjunctival injection 0.08 ml aflibercept ( 25 mg/ml ) single quarter conjunctiva , near limbus proximity area pathological neovascularization . During follow-up period , previous medical ophthalmic history document . On first visit , thorough eye examination perform ( include : Best Corrected Visual Acuity ( BCVA ) , slit lamp examination anterior segment include fluorescein stain cornea assessment epithelial integrity , intraocular pressure ( IOP ) measurement Goldman tonometry , specular microscopy examination ) . Follow-up examination occur day 7 , 14 , 30 , 60 , 90 follow injection . Each follow-up meeting include documentation BCVA , IOP , slit lamp exam specular microscopy exam . Investigators also perform anterior segment color photography injection last visit document regression neovascularization . If improvement partial improvement note 30th day follow-up , cornea specialist consider repeat subconjunctival aflibercept injection .</detailed_description>
