	<detailed_description>This study evaluate two experimental human monoclonal antibody ( mAbs ) : VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB ( VRC01 ) VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB ( VRC01LS ) . VRC01LS design longer half-life VRC01 . The purpose study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics , antiviral activity VRC01 VRC01LS serum mucosa healthy , HIV-uninfected adult . This study enroll healthy , HIV-uninfected adult five group . At various time point study , participant Groups 1 , 2 , 4 receive intravenous ( IV ) infusion VRC01 , participant Groups 3 5 receive IV infusion VRC01LS . Participants Groups 1 , 2 , 3 attend 13 14 study visit 1 1 ½ year ; participant Groups 4 5 attend 7 9 study visit 6 month 1 year . At certain time point , study visit include physical examination , blood collection , urine collection , interviews questionnaire . At time point , depend group assignment gender , visit also include collection cervicovaginal secretion , rectal secretion , semen ; cervical , vaginal , rectal biopsy .</detailed_description>
