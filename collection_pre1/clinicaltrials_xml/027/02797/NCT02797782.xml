	<brief_summary>More two billion individual serological evidence hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection worldwide . Of , 240 million chronic carrier approximately 786,000 hepatitis B related death occur annually . Currently available hepatitis B vaccine extremely safe efficacy &gt; 90 percent HBV serotypes genotype . Thus , HBV infection potentially eradicate global vaccination . A positive immune response vaccine define development hepatitis B surface antibody ( anti-HBs ) titer &gt; 10 mIU/mL . Although anti-HBs titer decrease time , duration protection long . Protection estimate persist 22 year primary vaccination schedule . Protection clinical disease , despite decline even undetectable anti-HBs level , probably due prim memory cell , capable elicit anamnestic response challenge . This support rapid increase anti-HBs titer previously vaccinate individual administer booster injection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Long Term Efficacy Recombinant Hepatitis B Vaccine Nile Delta Egypt</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A significant proportion vaccinate population loses protective level anti-HBs anamnestic response . Recommendations booster vaccination propose European consensus statement . Countries like Netherlands , Germany , Spain , France Belgium recommend booster dose depend post-vaccination anti-HBs titer . In UK , single booster dose recommend five year primary vaccination . In Egypt , routine infant immunization hepatitis B virus start 1992 , give 2nd , 4th 6th month age . In present study investigator investigate long term efficacy hepatitis B vaccination young adult 20 22 year primary vaccination Nile Delta Egypt .</detailed_description>
