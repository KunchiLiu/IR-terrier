	<brief_summary>There increase amount musculoskeletal injury past decade overused tendon represent major problem leisure occupational activity . A full understanding pathophysiology tendinopathy sparse especially early event tendinopathy remains unexplained . In phd study investigator investigate early change tendon tissue overload development tendinopathy . The investigator investigate sports-active individual recently develop tendinopathy regard symptom ( pain , function ) , tendon morphology ( ultrasonography , MRI electron microscopy ) , tendon mechanical property ( ultrasonography strain ) , tissue molecular biology ( expression content matrix protein ) , inflammation ( activity inflammatory pathway ) vascularization ( Doppler contrast enhancement US ) . The investigator hypothesize couple early symptom inflammatory activity , follow structural change alter mechanical property . The investigation indicate symptom tendon related determine measurement primary disease development ( `` tendinopathy blue print '' ) regard vital prevention tendinopathy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator intend study development tendinopathy human enter phase relative overloading tendon . This do large cohort individual investigator obtain basic data test . A percentage participant develop overuse symptom investigator perform investigation identify initial pathological change tendinopathy Participants include soon possible diagnosis either Achilles patella tendinopathy investigator wish investigate early change tendinopathy . The hypothesis , early development tendinopathy mismatch matrix protein anabolic catabolic pathway , associate secondary upregulation inflammatory apoptotic marker tendon result hypervascularization hyper-metabolism . Recruiting participant do collaboration local athletic club Copenhagen area . The athletic club include Sparta , Københavns Idræt Forening ( KIF ) , Frederiksberg Idræt Forening ( FIF ) . Furthermore , investigator establish contact online social medium Facebook , Twitter Google . In addition , Information leaflets hand , medical staff emergency room repeatedly inform project . Healthy participant directly recruit participant already project , social medias information leaflet hand . It plan inform staff emergency room Bispebjerg Hospital , Amager Hospital , Gentofte Hospital , Herlev Hospital Hvidovre Hospital . Patients healthy control contact primary investigator directly email telephone . Recruitment project TESINaC focus onset exercise pain every participant evaluate doctor participant tendinopathy . Once include participant undergo follow procedure soon possible diagnosis give : - Questionnaire regard train history ongoing symptom - Ultrasound scan tendon - Ultrasound isometric - Blood sample - MRI tendon legs MRI precedes biopsy identify diseased area within tendon biopsy take . Only participant tendinopathy undergo biopsy patella tendon project . Healthy participant undergo biopsy . No biopsy take Achilles tendon procedure may worsen participant symptom . Participants tendinopaty get physical reevaluate 3 , 6 12 month regard symptom , activity daily life , blood sample , questionnaires VISA-A/P ultrasound measurement . Rehabilitation training patient expect start soon possible biopsy take . Healthy participant reevaluate undergo rehabilitation training . It expect result study provide insight event lead develop tendinopati . This study add important information understand pathophysiology provide information timing phase well . Information result study give insight well treatment option specific early intervention individual basis . Furthermore , study investigate address question people develop tendinopathies others train volume equally raise .</detailed_description>
