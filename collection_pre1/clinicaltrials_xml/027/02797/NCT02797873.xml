	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate emotional non-emotional regulation process differ EIP patient ( different level ADHD symptoms/ADHD-comorbidity ) compare control . The investigator test participant ' ability regulate emotional non-emotional process , reward anticipation reward receipt undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . The participant ' motor inhibition capacity behavioral level also investigate . The hypothesis EIP patient present deficit emotion regulation process compare control , even control ADHD symptom . It also hypothesize high level ADHD symptom correlate dysfunctional non-emotional regulation process , behavioral well brain mechanistic level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Comorbidity Emotional Instability Personality Disorder ( EIP ) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) common , two patient group partially exhibit similar problem . The main hypothesis two disorder mechanistically relate . The investigator believe mechanism underlie problem link two parallel regulate system brain . Here , prefrontal anterior cingulate system focus . The first system - include dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) caudal anterior cingulate cortex ( cACC ) - regulate non-emotional ( exteroceptive ) information . The system - include lateral orbitofrontal prefrontal cortex ( lObfc ) rostral anterior cingulate cortex ( rACC ) - regulate emotional ( interoceptive ) information . The hypothesis non-emotional/exteroceptive regulatory system affect ADHD , emotional/interoceptive regulatory system affect EIP . Aims : The aim study differentiate dysfunctional emotional regulation process related emotional instability symptom ( control non-emotional ADHD-like symptom ) , dysfunctional non-emotional regulation process related ADHD symptom ( control emotional instability symptom ) . Procedure : - Participants : 30 young woman Emotional Instability Unit Child Adolescent Psychiatry Stockholm ( Dialectic Behavioral Therapy unit ( `` DBT-teamet '' ) ) , traits emotional instability varying level ADHD symptom . 30 match healthy control . - Tests : Behavioral task : Stop Signal Task : measure participant 's ability inhibit motor response . Outcome measure Stop Signal Reaction Time ( SSRT ) Go Reaction Time ( GoRT ) fMRI task 1 : Stroop task . Divided 2 session 10 minute 2 block . There two type block : Emotional Stroop task block ( happy fearful face , word `` HAPPY '' `` FEAR '' write across ) Neutral Stroop task block ( neutral face men woman word `` MAN '' `` WOMAN '' write across ) . Every block Emotional every Neutral ( balance order participant ) participant performs two emotional block two neutral block . The task decide emotion gender show picture ignore word . Responses make use button box reaction time record trial . Blood Oxygen Level Dependent ( BOLD ) signal record brain task . Outcome measure reaction time different trial type ( incongruent ( I ) congruent ( C ) , also order dependent ) well BOLD signal different type trial . fMRI task 2 : Monetary Incentive Delay task ( MID ) . Divided 2 session 10 minute . Reward task participant may win money ( 0 Swedish kronor ( SEK ) , 10 SEK 50 SEK trial ) . There anticipation phase trial , response cue participant need press button fast , outcome phase feedback present whether participant anticipate money . Outcome measure BOLD activation anticipation phase different level reward , BOLD activation receipt/outcome phase different level reward . Reaction time different reward level also record . The overall step-by-step procedure participant : - Telephone screening ( participant guardian ) : information study , MRI safety screening , check initial inclusion/exclusion criterion meet . - Informed consent : sent post legal guardian participant . Returned post test leader . - The Strengths Difficulties Questionnaire ( SDQ ) socio-economic status questionnaire send one legal guardian return test leader upon completion . - Visit/Day 1 : Assessment questionnaire , interview behavioral testing ( For selection participant : Structured Clinical Interview Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSM ) -IV ( SCID ) -II interview Borderline Antisocial part , SDQ , Adult Self-Report Scale ( ASRS ) , Autism Spectrum Quotient ( AQ ) , Toronto Alexithymia Scale ( TAS ) -20 , Ravens SPM , read test , color vision test , questionnaire additional question . For characterization participant : Brown-Attention Deficit Disorder ( ADD ) , Mood Feelings Questionnaire ( MFQ ) , State Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait ( STAI-T ) , Barratt 's Impulsivity Scale ( BIS ) ) . Frankfurter Test und Training de Erkennens von fazialem Affekt ( FEFA ) 2 test ( face recognition ) Stop signal test ( SST ) . Approximately 3 hour . - DAWBA computerize interview home . Both participant one legal guardian complete . - Additional information patient record gather , verify current previous diagnosis . - Visit/Day 2 : Assessments questionnaire ( STAI-S , last menstruation , sleepiness rating , motivation rating ) . MRI-scan : session 1 : T1 , Stroop session 1 , Stroop session 2 , T2 . Break . Session 2 : MID session 1 , MID session 2 . Break . Session 3 : resting state , DTI . Assessments scan : debriefing questionnaire , `` After MID task '' questionnaire . Approximately 3 hour .</detailed_description>
