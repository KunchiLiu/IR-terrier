	<brief_summary>CCT245737 type drug call kinase inhibitor . It block chemical messenger ( enzyme ) call checkpoint kinase 1 ( CHK-1 ) part signal process within cell make cell produce chemical trigger control cell growth cell death . Chemotherapy agent use try kill cancer cell however sometimes cancer cell repair use signal process continue grow . It think CCT245737 may help chemotherapy work well prevent cancer cell repair , damage chemotherapy , cancer cell kill . There 2 stage study : 1 . Patients Stage 1 give CCT245737 take addition receive treatment gemcitabine cisplatin . 2 . Patients Stage 2 give CCT245737 take addition receive treatment gemcitabine . The main aim study find maximum dose CCT245737 give safely patient gemcitabine cisplatin gemcitabine alone , potential side effect drug manage happens combination drug inside body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial CCT245737 Combination With Gemcitabine Plus Cisplatin Gemcitabine Alone Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each stage study split two part : Part one 'dose escalation ' phase cohorts 3 6 patient receive increase dos CCT245737 recommend Phase II dose establish . Part two 'expansion phase ' large group patient treat recommended Phase II dose find drug work . In Stage 1 dose expansion part , patient either solid tumour amenable biopsy non-small cell lung cancer recruit . In Stage 2 dose expansion part patient either solid tumour amenable biopsy pancreatic cancer recruit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Written ( sign date ) inform consent capable cooperate treatment followup . 2 . Histologically cytologically proven solid tumour treatment gemcitabine plus cisplatin gemcitabine alone consider appropriate Investigator . 3 . Life expectancy least 12 week . 4 . World Health Organisation ( WHO ) performance status 01 ( Appendix 1 ) . 5 . Haematological biochemical index within range show . These measurement must perform within one week patient receive first dose IMP . Laboratory Test Value require Haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥ 90 g/L Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and/or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) Alkaline Phosphatase ( ALP ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN unless raise due tumour case 5 x ULN permissible Renal function Stage 1 ( CCT245737 + gemcitabine + cisplatin schedule ) Either : Calculated creatinine clearance Cockroft ≥ 60 mL/min Gault formula Or : Isotope clearance measurement ≥ 60 mL/min ( uncorrected value ) Renal function Stage 2 ( CCT245737 + ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Gemcitabine schedule ) Serum Creatinine QTcF Equal le 450 msec 6 . 18 year time consent give . 7 . Expansion Cohort MTD : Patients must give consent disease amenable paired biopsy solid tumour cohort ( Optional NSCLC Pancreatic Cancer cohort ) . 1 . Radiotherapy within last six week ( except symptom control lesion use measurable disease ) endocrine therapy , immunotherapy chemotherapy previous four week , immunotherapy previous four week , nitrosoureas MitomycinC previous six week investigational medicinal product ( IMPs ) previous four week treatment . Patients prostate cancer continue treatment luteinising hormone release hormone ( LHRH ) analogues . 2 . No three previous line cytotoxic chemotherapy metastatic disease . 3 . If , opinion Investigator , patient highly likely experience clinically significant myelosuppression , base previous experience chemotherapy . 4 . Ongoing toxic manifestation previous treatment great CTCAE Grade 1 . Exceptions alopecia ongoing toxic manifestation opinion Investigator CDD Medical Advisor exclude patient . 5 . Clinical significant hearing impairment . 6 . History allergy cisplatin platinum contain compound , gemcitabine , excipients product . 7 . New progress brain metastasis . Patients brain metastasis radiologically stable 8 week period may include . 8 . Female patient able become pregnant ( already pregnant lactate ) . However , patient negative serum urine pregnancy test enrolment agree use two form contraception ( one highly effective form plus barrier method ) [ oral ; inject implant hormonal contraception condom ; intrauterine device condom ; diaphragm spermicidal gel condom ] sexual abstinence , effective first administration CCT245737 , throughout trial six month afterwards consider eligible . 9 . Male patient partner childbearing potential ( unless agree take measure father child use barrier method contraception [ condom plus spermicide ] sexual abstinence , effective first administration CCT245737 , throughout trial six month afterwards . Men partner childbearing potential must also willing ensure partner us effective method contraception duration example , hormonal contraception , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicidal gel sexual abstinence ) . Men pregnant lactate partner must advise use barrier method contraception ( example , condom plus spermicidal gel ) prevent exposure foetus neonate . 10 . Major thoracic abdominal surgery patient yet recover . 11 . At high medical risk nonmalignant systemic disease include active uncontrolled infection . 12 . Known serologically positive hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus . 13 . Concurrent congestive heart failure , prior history class III/ IV cardiac disease ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] refer Appendix 3 ) , prior history cardiac ischaemia prior history cardiac arrhythmia 14 . Prior bone marrow transplant extensive radiotherapy great 25 % bone marrow within eight week . 15 . Peanut allergy 16 . Is participant plan participate another interventional clinical trial , whilst take part Phase I study CCT245737 . Participation observational trial interventional clinical trial involve administration IMP would place unacceptable burden patient opinion Investigator Medical Advisor would acceptable . 17 . Any condition Investigator 's opinion would make patient good candidate clinical trial .</criteria>
