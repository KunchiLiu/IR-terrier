	<brief_summary>There exist evidence show vegetable oil unsaturated fatty acid sn-2 position predominantly palmitic acid ( C16:0 ) stearic acid ( C18:0 ) sn-1 sn-3 position fat molecule raise serum cholesterol level . These observation come know explained `` sn-2 hypothesis '' . New evidence also emerge show saturate fatty acid ( C16:0 , C18:0 ) sn-1 -3 position reduces fat deposition rat model . Therefore , study human warrant confirm earlier finding . Fats oil make &gt; 90 % triacylglycerol ( TAG ) - fat molecule consist glycerol backbone 3 esterify fatty acid attach . The position fatty acid attachment refer stereospecific number , sn -1 , -2 -3 . Early evidence show unique stereospecificity fatty acid distribution palm fat molecule confer health benefit inhibit experimental atherosclerosis rabbit model . In vegetable oil , oleic acid [ monounsaturated fatty acid ( MUFA ) ] predominantly situate sn-2 position , animal fat predominantly palmitic acid stearic acid ( C16:0 C18:0-saturated fat ) situate . Even though palm olein lard similar proportion saturate fatty acid ( SFA ) , MUFA polyunsatuared fatty acid ( PUFA ) , differ significantly positional distribution TAG molecule . Palm olein TAG contains 7-11 % palmitic acid sn-2 position 87 % unsaturated fatty acid ( oleic acid linoleic acid ) . Lard high amount palmitic acid sn-2 position 70 % . On hand , human milk , palmitic acid predominantly sn-2 ( 53-57 % ) cow milk fat contain less palmitic acid ( 38 % ) . It believe distribution fatty acid TAG important fatty acid composition alone confer oil ' 'saturated ' 'unsaturated ' property . In proposed study , effect outcome measure investigate different fatty acid ( palmitic acid , oleic acid , linoleic acid ) sn-1 , sn-2 sn-3 position TAG molecule three different test fat investigate .</brief_summary>
