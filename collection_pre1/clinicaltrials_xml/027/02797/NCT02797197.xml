	<brief_summary>Sarcopenia define loss skeletal muscle mass function ( strength and/or performance ) . There high prevalence elderly patient cancer . Several mechanism know explain sarcopenia ( inflammation , neurodegenerative process , hormonal disorder , lack exercise , malnutrition ) . The consequence analyse several study sarcopenia appeared independent factor mortality , associate cancer-related fatigue , nosocomial infection , cardio-vascular disease , chemotherapy toxicity . Diagnosis base measure muscle mass perform abdominal computed-tomography ( CT ) scan , measure muscle strength use handgrip test `` JamarÂ® '' hydraulic hand dynamometer . CT scan invasive less easy reach handgrip test . This test use perform elderly cancer patient chemotherapy . Present prospective study explore feasibility systematic handgrip strength test short-term change muscle strength digestive cancer patient treat chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
