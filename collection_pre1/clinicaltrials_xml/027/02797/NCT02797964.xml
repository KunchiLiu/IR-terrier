	<brief_summary>The main aim clinical study find maximum dose CCT245737 give safely patient , potential side effect drug manage happens CCT245737 inside body . CCT245737 type drug call kinase inhibitor . It block chemical messenger ( enzyme ) call checkpoint kinase 1 ( CHK-1 ) part signal process within cell . This make cell produce chemical trigger control cell growth cell death . In type cancer chemical messenger 'switched ' 'switched ' allow cancer cell keep grow grow quickly normal cell . Kinase inhibitors new type drug use try stop growth cancer kill cancer cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial CCT245737 Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study follow dose escalation design , initially single patient cohort Grade 2 toxicity observe , cohort expand 3-6 patient follow roll six design maximum tolerate dose reach . Six patient disease amenable biopsy treat dose level order establish recommence Phase II dose evaluation .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Written ( sign date ) inform consent capable cooperate treatment followup . 2 . Histologically cytologically proven solid tumour , refractory conventional treatment , conventional therapy consider appropriate Investigator decline patient . 3 . Life expectancy least 12 week . 4 . World Health Organisation ( WHO ) performance status 01 ( Appendix 1 ) . 5 . Haematological biochemical index within range show . These measurement must perform within one week patient receive first dose IMP Laboratory Test Value require Haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥ 90 g/L Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and/or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) Alkaline Phosphatase ( ALP ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN unless raise due tumour case 5 x ULN permissible Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) 6 . At least 18 year old time consent give . 7 . Expansion Cohort MTD : Patients must give consent disease amenable paired biopsy . 1 . Radiotherapy within last six week ( except symptom control lesion use measurable disease ) endocrine therapy except luteinizing hormone release hormone ( LHRH ) agonists prostate cancer , , patient , chemotherapy previous four week , immunotherapy previous six week , nitrosoureas MitomycinC previous six week investigational medicinal product ( IMPs ) four week treatment . 2 . Ongoing toxic manifestation previous treatment great CTCAE Grade 1 . Exceptions alopecia certain toxicity , opinion Investigator Medical Advisor exclude patient . 3 . New progress brain metastasis . Patients brain metastasis radiologically stable 8 week period may include . 4 . Female patient able become pregnant ( already pregnant lactate ) . However , patient negative serum urine pregnancy test enrolment agree use two form contraception ( one highly effective form plus barrier method ) [ oral ; inject implant hormonal contraception condom ; intrauterine device condom ; diaphragm spermicidal gel condom ] agree sexual abstinence , effective first administration CCT245737 , throughout trial six month afterwards consider eligible . 5 . Male patient partner childbearing potential ( unless agree take measure father child use barrier method contraception [ condom plus spermicide ] sexual abstinence effective first administration CCT245737 , throughout trial six month afterwards . Men partner childbearing potential must also willing ensure partner us effective method contraception duration example , hormonal contraception , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicidal gel sexual abstinence ) . Men pregnant lactate partner must advise use barrier method contraception ( example , condom plus spermicidal gel ) prevent exposure foetus neonate . 6 . Major thoracic abdominal surgery patient yet recover . 7 . At high medical risk nonmalignant systemic disease include active uncontrolled infection . 8 . Known serologically positive hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . 9 . Concurrent congestive heart failure , prior history class III/ IV cardiac disease ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] refer Appendix 3 ) , prior history cardiac ischaemia prior history cardiac arrhythmia . 10 . Prior bone marrow transplant extensive radiotherapy great 25 % bone marrow within 8 week . 11 . Patients previously myelosuppressive drug mitomycin C within last 6 week . 12 . Peanut allergy . 13 . QTc &gt; 450 msec adult male &gt; 470msec adult female . 14 . Is participant plan participate another interventional clinical trial , whilst take part Phase I study CCT245737 . Participation observational trial interventional clinical trial involve administration IMP would place unacceptable burden patient opinion Investigator Medical Advisor would acceptable . 15 . Any condition Investigator 's opinion would make patient good candidate clinical trial .</criteria>
