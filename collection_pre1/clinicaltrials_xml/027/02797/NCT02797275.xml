	<brief_summary>Exposure secondhand tobacco smoke ( SHS ) associate diverse health effect nonsmoker . Flight attendant work commercial aircraft ban tobacco smoking ( expose FAs ) high , long-term level occupational exposure SHS unique population study long-term health effect chronic exposure SHS . In previous study , show many never-smoking SHS-exposed FAs curvilinear flow-volume loop , decrease airflow mid- low-lung volume , static air trap ( elevate residual volume total lung capacity ratio [ RV/TLC ] ) , abnormalities diagnostic overt COPD , implicate presence obstructive ventilatory defect , consistent recently describe preserve ratio impaired spirometry ( PRISm ) . The main objective study determine effect bronchodilator counter physiologic abnormality observe population never-smoking SHS-exposed FAs proof concept presence obstructive lung disease possible therapeutic option counteract adverse respiratory effect chronic exposure SHS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective research plan investigate hypothesis subclinical airflow limitation air trap never-smoking SHS-exposed individual preserve ratio impaired spirometry ( PRISm ) cause reduced exercise capacity . This turn adversely affect symptom quality life . Furthermore , hypothesize exercise capacity , symptom , quality life improve use inhaled bronchodilator . We propose investigate hypothesis follow specific aim : Aim 1- Determine whether airflow limitation never-smoking SHS-exposed individual airflow limitation air trap associate reduced exercise capacity adverse health health-related quality life ( HRQL ) . We propose measure ( 1 ) maximum level exercise ( watt ) maximum oxygen uptake ( VO2 ) laboratory setting , ( 2 ) level physical activity subject ' routine daily life use activity monitor , ( 3 ) measure HRQL use survey tool . We propose explore association measure index air trap rest ( RV/TLC ) progressive airflow limitation exercise ( end expiratory lung volume [ EELV ] dynamic hyperinflation [ DH ] ) . Aim 2 : Determine whether relief airflow limitation use bronchodilator could improve exercise capacity never-smoking SHS-exposed individual airflow limitation air trap double blind crossover placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial . We propose examine effect bronchodilator airflow limitation air trap effect turn exercise capacity , daily level physical activity , HRQL show cause-and-effect relationship . In way , plan explore utility bronchodilator treatment option observe reduced exercise capacity .</detailed_description>
