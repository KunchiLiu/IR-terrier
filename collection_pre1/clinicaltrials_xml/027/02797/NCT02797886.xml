	<brief_summary>The goal study explore effect combine training involve functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) ankle dorsal flexor simultaneous maximal-effort voluntary contraction muscle correct improve foot drop chronic stroke patient . Participants assess functional motor ability neurological function first visit five ten week train . Functional motor ability break dorsiflexion strength general gait analysis . Dorsiflexion strength measure use dynamometer . Gait assess via recording electromyography , pedobarography , kinematic , various functional variable 10 walk trial . The neurological assessment include electroencephalographic ( EEG ) analysis movement-related cortical potential ( MRCP ) , somatosensory evoke potential ( SSEP ) , M-wave response stimulation . Participants randomly assign one three group : 1 ) FES + volitional movement ( VOL ) , 2 ) FES alone , 3 ) VOL alone , determine training regimen . The training session involve roughly 20 minute repeat muscle contraction ( appropriate break avoid fatigue ) . The participant assign FES+VOL group receive electrical stimulation peroneal nerve concert volitional dorsiflexion , whereas group either dorsiflex voluntarily stimulation receive stimulation ask nothing .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Must hemiplegic secondary stroke exhibit foot drop ( diagnosed participant 's treat physician ) Between age 10 90 . Must sustain stroke least 6 month prior enrollment . Uninvolved low limb must history injury pathology within last 90 day . Must able walk independently 10 meter . Must inadequate dorsiflexion swing phase gait result inadequate limb clearance Medically stable three month prior recent episode stroke result hemiplegia hemiparesis foot drop Adequate cognitive function give inform consent , understand instruction , give adequate feedback . Individuals additional orthopedic , neuromuscular , neurological pathology would interfere ability walk Individuals previous use FES community ambulation ( neuroprosthesis ) clinical treatment &lt; 1 year exclude participation due possible confounding effect Severe cardiac disease myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure Fixed ankle contracture ten degree plantarflexion knee extend Preexisting pathology result significant disruption alignment function low extremity Excessive dysesthetic pain secondary neurological involvement Severe hypertonicity result need involve rehabilitation strategy Participants exclude due gender ethnicity .</criteria>
