	<brief_summary>Endotracheal pressure different cuff shape result different cuff pressure change head positional change . In study , 52 patient underwent middle ear surgery general anesthesia randomly allocate two group ; patient intubate taper guard cuffed tube cylindrical shape cuffed tube . Anesthesia maintain sevoflurane air/oxygen remifentanil . The cuff pressure initially set 22 centimeter water neural head position measure change 45 degree head rotation . The change cuff pressure compare two group</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endotracheal pressure different cuff shape result different cuff pressure change head positional change . In study , 52 patient underwent middle ear surgery general anesthesia randomly allocate two group ; patient intubate taper guard cuffed tube cylindrical shape cuffed tube . Anesthesia maintain sevoflurane air/O2 remifentanil . The cuff pressure initially set 24 centimeter water neural head position measure change 45 degree head rotation . In addition , sore throat , hoarseness , dysphagia cough record 0 , 6 , 12 , 24 hr surgery . The change cuff pressure compare two group . The side effect associate tube compare two group .</detailed_description>
