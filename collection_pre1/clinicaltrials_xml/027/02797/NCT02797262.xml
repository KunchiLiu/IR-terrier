	<brief_title>Measuring Monitoring Adherence ART With Pill Ingestible Sensor System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) transform HIV-infection fatal manageable disease adherence ART remain critical optimize outcome . Existing measure ART adherence self-report , pill count , electronic pill-bottle cap , prescription refill , provide inferred measure actual drug intake offer real-time notification capability . Directly observed therapy measure actual drug intake practical . These limitation constrain research medication adherence importantly , limit ability develop real-time intervention base feasible , vivo monitoring adherence among HIV-infected people facilitate medication-taking . The Proteus digital health feedback ( PDHF ) system , pill ingestible sensor base adherence measure monitoring system develop Proteus Digital Health , address limitation . It involve use ingestible sensor , tiny edible material over-encapsulated along prescribed medication . The sensor activate ingestion sense patch worn patient embed monitor sensor . The monitor send Bluetooth signal mobile device , turn sends encrypted message central server , thus effect real-time monitoring dose take . The investigator propose develop data receive hub add component automate text message send patient dose miss . The ingestible sensor patch monitor system already FDA-approved safe , yet test HIV-infected patient clinical setting . The first goal study confirm bioavailability over-encapsulated antiretrovirals ( ARVs ) pilot-test use PDHF system 15 participant prescribe ARVs test identify approach optimize use measure monitoring system . The next goal determine system 's feasibility , acceptability , sustainability , accuracy efficacy foster ART adherence . Feasibility , acceptability sustainability assess patient ' rating system rate drop use system . Accuracy evaluate association adherence ART measure PDHF system adherence measure plasma drug level concentration ARVs self-report . Efficacy assess compare adherence participant assign PDHF system participant assign usual care ( UC ) time , exploratory outcomes viral load CD4 . The investigator recruit 120 HIV-infected patient 18 year old sub-optimal adherence . Participants randomize receive PDHF system UC 16 week monthly assessment . The durability effect PDHF system stop use system determine 12-week follow-up stage . In summary , The investigator evaluate feasibility , acceptability sustainability use PDHF system ; ass accuracy PDHF system measure adherence ART ; evaluate efficacy PDHF system monitor leverage adherence ART .</detailed_description>
