	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose gene therapy treat patient human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -related lymphoma respond therapy come back original response receive stem cell transplant . In gene therapy , small stretch deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) call `` anti-HIV gene '' introduce stem cell laboratory make gene therapy product use study . The type anti-HIV gene therapy study may make patient 's immune cell resistant HIV-1 prevent new immune cell get infected HIV-1 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Safety , define timely engraftment ( collective establishment persistent absolute neutrophil count least 500 cells/mm^3 platelet count 20,000 cells/mm^3 without transfusion 3 consecutive day ) one month post transplant , absence study candidate specific grade 3 4 non-hematopoietic organ toxicity clonal expansion . II . Efficacy candidate product , define establishment &gt; 5 % mononuclear blood cell express anti-HIV gene peripheral blood 3 month post-transplant . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine presence , quantity , duration gene modify HIV-1 resistant peripheral blood cell gut mucosal immune cell . II . To study integration site vector sequence circulate cell . III . To study progression-free survival . IV . To study overall survival . V. To study complete response rate duration . VI . To study partial response rate duration . VII . To study time neutrophil engraftment ( first 3 consecutive day absolute neutrophil count [ ANC ] &gt; 500 cells/mm^3 ) . VIII . To study time platelet engraftment ( first 3 consecutive day platelet &gt; 20,000 cells/mm^3 without platelet transfusion 7 day prior ) . IX . To study hematologic function day 100 ( ANC &gt; 1500 , hemoglobin [ Hb ] &gt; 10 g/dl without transfusion platelet &gt; 100,000 ) X . To study cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4 recovery conclusion trial . XI . To study safety term toxicity , infection , transfusion , infusion-related reaction . XII . To study HIV-1 viral load time . XIII . To study persistence vector-transduced cell time . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate presence magnitude expansion HIV-1 resistant immune cell peripheral blood gut mucosa transplant participant , subsequent withhold anti-retroviral therapy ( ART ) . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients receive BEAM regimen administer standard care comprise carmustine day -6 , cytarabine twice daily ( BID ) day -5 -2 , etoposide BID day -5 -2 , melphalan day -1 . Patients undergo infusion lentivirus vector CCR5 shRNA/TRIM5alpha/TAR decoy-transduced autologous CD34-positive hematopoietic progenitor cell 1 hour . After completion study treatment , patient follow day 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 42 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 300 , 360 , 420 , 480 , 520 , 600 , 660 , 720 , yearly least 15 year .</detailed_description>
