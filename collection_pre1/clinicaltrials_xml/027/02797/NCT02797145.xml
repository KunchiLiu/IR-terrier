	<brief_summary>Digoxin approve heart failure treatment 1998 accord current regulation make Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , base follow clinical trial : The Prospective Randomized Study Ventricular Function Efficacy Digoxin ( PROVED ) , Randomized Assessment Digoxin Inhibitors Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ( RADIANCE ) Digitalis Investigation Group ( DIG ) . Also , approve control ventricular response rate atrial fibrillation patient . Several clinical trial digoxin provide convince evidence support digoxin use heart failure ( HF ) treatment symptomatic patient . PROVED trial placebo-controlled , twelve week duration study . This study include patient decrease systolic function , sinus rhythm heart failure stable symptom , patient use digoxin diuretic . Patients digoxin remove presented twice heart failure worsen , reduction exercise capacity also reduction leave ventricle ejection fraction , comparison patient keep digoxin therapy . The study RADIANCE follow similar protocol ; however patient use ACE inhibitor besides digoxin diuretic . The digoxin removal associate six time worsen heart failure , despite maintenance ACE inhibitor diuretic . There worsen functional capacity , life quality ejection fraction digoxin removal patient ' group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The benefit digoxin relate hemodynamic effect , also capacity improve neuro hormonal profile . Improvements neurohormonal profile hemodynamic occur low dos digoxin , dose increment always result improve effect . In study PROVE e RADIANCE clinical benefit similar among patient low digoxin serum ( serum &lt; 1ng/mL ) high dose digoxin serum . One current post-hoc analysis DIG study , include patient preserve systolic function reduce systolic function , suggest survival benefit patient &lt; 1,0 ng/mL digoxin serum . Several study document effectiveness digoxin reduce clinically relevant outcome HF patient . These study show symptomatic improvement aerobic capacity life quality patient symptomatic HF ( functional class II-IV ) . Such benefit occur independently basal rhythm HF aetiology . It important highlight study perform period BB utilization systolic HF treatment . On hand , side DIG study evaluate digoxin effect versus placebo patient preserve eject . The use digoxin effect mortality hospitalization due cardiovascular cause . There tendency reduce hospitalization due HF worsening ; however also increase tendency increase hospitalization due unstable angina . Currently document digoxin serum level 1,0 ng/dL associate high chance death , retrospective analysis SOLVD DIG study . The subgroup keep digoxin serum level 0,3 0,9 ng/mL great benefit , include less mortality men . From finding , begin recommend low dos digoxin order get serum level . Remains discussion utilization serum level therapeutic guideline bring additional benefit . The PROVED RADIANCE study show necessity keep digoxin use symptomatic HF patient , otherwise functional class worsen increase hospitalization chance . [ 2 ] However , long-term effect digoxin mortality hospitalization heart failure cause unknown . The use digoxin increase intracellular concentration calcium ion , increase platelet activation favor occurrence thromboembolic event . This fact particularly dangerous patient AF increase susceptibility suffer ischemic stroke due thromboembolic event . Besides , high number drug use management patient HF reduce renal clearance support elevation serum digoxin concentration increase toxicity mortality arrhythmia . ( OUYANG et al. , 2015 ) ( WHITBECK et al. , 2013 ) . It worth note DIG study exclude trial patient AF , carry strict control digoxin serum level . These two fact take together may collaborate digoxin action neutrality mortality rate . A particular concern fact elevate digoxin serum level correlate increased mortality multiple patient population . The AFFIRM study identify association digoxin use all-cause mortality ( 1.41 , 95 % CI 1.19-1.67 , P &lt; 0.001 ) ; cardiovascular mortality ( 1.35 , 95 % CI 1.06-1.71 , P &lt; 0.016 ) ; death arrhythmias ( 1.61 , 95 % CI 1,12-2,30 , P &lt; 0,009 ) ( WHITBECK et al. , 2013 ) . By contrast , AFFIRM study hold control digoxin serum level patient use digoxin . The RIKS-HIA study evaluate outcome 1 year 4426 patient AF without congestive heart failure use digoxin , identify increase overall mortality relative risk estimate 1.42 ( 95 % CI 1.29 1 , 56 % ) compare 16,587 control patient . Another study perform investigate well effect digoxin TREAT-AF ( The Retrospective Evaluation Assessment Therapies AF ) study . This study retrospective cohort study patient newly diagnose AF treat U.S. Department Veterans Affairs ( VA ) healthcare system . The TREAT-AF compare data patient treat digoxin patient non-treated digoxin . The result show digoxin treatment significantly associate death multivariate Cox regression model ( hazard ratio [ HR ] : 1.26 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 1.23 1.29 , p &lt; 0.001 ) propensity match ( HR : 1.21 , 95 % CI : 1.17 1.25 , p &lt; 0.001 ) . Also cumulative incidence death high digoxin-treated patient versus untreated group ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . The TREST-AF outcome exalt need investigation digoxin effect . Observational data generally come similar conclusion . In large study 2,892 Kaiser patient newly diagnose heart failure reduce ejection fraction ( HFrEF ) , 22.9 % AF , incident digoxin use associate high mortality ( HR : 1.72 ; 95 % CI : 1,25 2.36 ) , significant difference risk HF hospitalization ( HR : 1.05 ; 95 % CI0.82 1.34 ) . The ATRIA-CVRN ( Anti-coagulation Risk factor Atrial Fibrillation-Cardiovascular Research Network ) study , propensity score matching analysis 14,787 Kaiser patient incident AF without HF , find incident digoxin use independently associate high risk death ( HR : 1.71 ; 95 % CI : 1.52 1.93 ) high risk hospitalization ( HR : 1.63 ; 95 % CI : 1.56 1.71 ) .
