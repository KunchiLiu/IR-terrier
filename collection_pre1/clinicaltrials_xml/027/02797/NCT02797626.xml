	<brief_summary>Primary objective : evaluate progression-free survival patient clinical stage II A/B seminomatous germ cell tumor undergo primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection ( RPLND ) without adjuvant treatment Secondary objective : - overall survival - perioperative complication ( Clavien-Dindo score ) - quality life ( EORTC QLQ C30 , EORTC QLQ TC26 ) - long term sequela - rate retrograde ejaculation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Evaluate Progression Free Survival With Primary Retroperitoneal Lymph-node Dissection ( pRPLND ) Only Patients With Seminomatous Testicular Germ Cell Tumors With Clinical Stage IIA/B ( PRIMETEST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard treatment patient clinical stage IIA seminoma ( isolated retroperitoneal lymph nod 2 cm ) radiotherapy ( 30Gy ) clinical stage IIB ( isolated retroperitoneal lymph node 2-5 cm ) radiotherapy ( 36Gy , extend iliac field ) . Alternatively , 3 course BEP equal ( 1,2,3,4 ) . According EAU guideline 3 cycle BEP substitute 4 x PE patient contraindication bleomycin . Radiotherapy well chemotherapy several side effect : multiple study show significant long term toxicity cisplatin chemotherapy cardiotoxicity nephrotoxicity ( 5,6,7,8 , 9 ) . Patients radiotherapy show significant increase rate secondary malignancy long term follow-up ( relative risk 1.3 1.4 ) ( 13 , 14 ) . There reliable data recurrence patient seminoma CS II undergone surgery . After publication Warszawski et al 1997 primary RPLND seminoma perform routine basis ( 10 ) . However , seminoma metastasis follow anatomical principle non-seminoma primarily lymphatic . In clinical stage I high risk seminoma patient overall recurrence rate without adjuvant therapy ~ 30 % , CS IIB patient radiotherapy around 18 % , respectively ( 11,12 ) . If seminoma stage II patient could achieve less 10 % recurrence rate surgery , surveillance well single course adjuvant chemotherapy would justify . The overall burden standard treatment 3 4 course chemotherapy could thereby considerably reduce . With recurrence rate &gt; 30 % ( exceed upper border confidence interval ) every third patient would require surgery chemotherapy overall treatment burden would justify approach . Thus , hypothesis trial currently overtreatment patient low volume metastasis either initially diagnose recurrence 3 course BEP chemotherapy recommend standard treatment patient . In addition , surgical technique evolve laparoscopic robot-assisted RPLND seem possible unilateral low stage disease . In order clarify role primary RPLND patient cohort , progression-free survival explore single arm non-randomized trial . Only recurrence rate exceed publish figure adjuvant treatment justify . In subsequent trial patient may select base prognostic parameter receive surveillance primary RPLND treat 1 course BEP case higher relapse figure . Therefore , trial may serve first step improve overall treatment burden patient clinical stage II disease .</detailed_description>
