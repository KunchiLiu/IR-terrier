	<brief_summary>Pregnancy associate major change body 's physiological status composition . These change may modify pharmacologic and/or pharmacokinetic profile drug . Pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic change 1st trimester pregnancy attribute following factor ; Increase plasma volume , heart rate cardiac output ; decrease blood pressure due decrease systemic resistance relative decrease hepatic circulation aggravation hepatic dysfunction . These change intensify pregnancy progress 3rd trimester take effect onset time duration muscle relaxant . Rocuronium steroidal non-depolarizing muscle relaxant like vecuronium mostly excrete bile hepatic metabolism classify FDA pregnancy category B , widely use general anesthesia pregnant woman . Previous study report onset time rocuronium affect cardiac output , blood circulation time whole body , muscle perfusion . Accordingly , many research conduct assumption onset time duration affect physiologic change pregnancy . For example , research vecuronium use muscle relaxant pregnant woman undergo C-sec , onset vecuronium significantly short control group duration longer . In study investigate rocuronium use patient right delivery , onset time short duration longer control group . However , previous research mostly focus 3rd trimester , study onset time duration rocuronium non-obstetric surgery transabdominal cervicoisthmic cerclage ( TCIC ) Mcdonald surgery perform general anesthesia 2nd trimester . In research , onset time duration rocuronium , widely use general anesthesia 2nd trimester pregnant female , compare patient control group .</brief_summary>
