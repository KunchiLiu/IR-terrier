	<brief_summary>Background : Free gingival graft ( FGG ) use increase keratinize tissue dimension . This prospective clinical trial conduct aim determine whether addition autologous platelet-rich fibrin ( PRF ) would improve soft tissue heal donor site decrease pain score . Methods : Twenty four patient plan receive FGG augment keratinize tissue dimension mandibular incisor area . Donor site assign randomly receive PRF flip coin screen visit . Patients instruct complete pain study form . The palatal donor area evaluate complete wound heal record . These data assess record surgery , 1,2,3,4 8 week postoperatively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Despite relatively painful surgical procedure , free gingival graft ( FGG ) still commonly used increase keratinize tissue dimension . This prospective clinical trial conduct aim determine whether addition autologous platelet-rich fibrin ( PRF ) harvest FGG would improve soft tissue heal donor site subsequently decrease pain score . Methods : Twenty four patient plan receive FGG augment keratinize tissue dimension mandibular incisor area . Enrolled patient receive periodontal examination , oral hygiene instruction full-mouth debridement follow standardized FGG similar dimension . Donor site assign randomly receive PRF flip coin screen visit . Patients instruct complete pain study form analyze pain score include VAS , NRS-101 , VRS-4 well three anxiety scale base line . The palatal donor area evaluate complete wound heal base degree color match , tissue texture , contour surgical area compare preoperative record . These data assess record surgery , 1,2,3,4 8 week postoperatively .</detailed_description>
