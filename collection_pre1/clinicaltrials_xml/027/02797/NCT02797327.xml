	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Preterm birth occur 37 week major cause neonatal mortality morbidity , affect 8 % newborns Thailand-Myanmar border . Identifying biochemical marker associate preterm birth guide design effective target intervention strategy woman risk . In order identify biomarkers signatures predictive preterm birth investigator employ high throughput profile technology ( aka `` system approach '' ) maximize amount information obtain knowledge generate participant sample . Preliminary data also obtain infectious complication order assess potential system approach approach detect infectious event onset clinical symptom absence clinical symptom . The rationale behind approach importance establish personalized medicine approach detail recent opinion article publish Dr Chaussabel et al ( 2015 ) A vision prescription big data-enabled medicine . Nat Immunol 16 : 435-439 . In addition parallel study carry country Qatar US order ass environmental influence blood transcriptome signature . RESEARCH DESIGN This prospective pregnancy cohort first trimester post-partum . The investigator unable predict woman preterm birth infection . STUDY POPULATION 400 Pregnant woman confirm viable pregnancy 8+0 week less 14 week pregnancy , healthy , intend deliver SMRU attend two weekly ANC visit . METHOD AND TECHNIQUE - Pregnant woman attend SMRU ANC clinic invite participate study . - Study sample include : 1 . A small blood volume ( 100 micro litre ) collect finger prick sampling via capillary straw . The sample transfer microtube contain RNA stabilize solution store -80°C . This repeat every two week , delivery post-partum . 2 . A stool sample collect stored -80°C . This collected trimester , delivery post-partum . 3 . A vaginal swab collect posterior fornix direct visualization midwife ; store -80°C . This collected trimester , delivery post-partum . The post-partum visit , 4-6 week 3months . The investigator estimate 15-18 blood sample , 6 stool vaginal swab collect per woman attend expect . Fetal growth measure 5-6 weekly ultrasound scan . The sample set repeat woman fever pregnancy post-partum ( estimate 5 % woman ) . POTENTIAL VALUE Identifying biochemical marker associate preterm guide design effective target intervention strategy aim woman risk preterm birth .</detailed_description>
