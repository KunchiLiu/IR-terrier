	<brief_summary>Many individual cervical spinal cord injury ( SCI ) difficulty use hand arm . MyndMove non-invasive medical device use short , low energy electrical pulse surface electrode cause muscle contraction produce full range reach grasp movement , patient unable perform him/herself . By use MyndMove therapy help individual move arm hand he/she attempt carry typical reach grasp movement , individual improves ability perform task voluntarily . The purpose study study effectiveness MyndMove therapy improve ability individual move arm hand .</brief_summary>
