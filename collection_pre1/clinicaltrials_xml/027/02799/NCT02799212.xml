	<brief_summary>Most patient undergo hepatectomy hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) suffer underlie liver disease expose risk postoperative ascites , subsequent morbidity , liver renal failure , need specific treatment prolonged hospital stay . Postoperative ascites favor imbalance portal venous inflow diminish hepatic venous outflow . Finding reversible , non-invasive method modulate portal inflow would interest : could use temporarily early postoperative course prevent acute portal hypertension . Somatostatin , well-known drug already use several indication , may limit risk postoperative ascites liver failure decrease portal pressure hepatectomy HCC patient underlie liver disease .</brief_summary>
