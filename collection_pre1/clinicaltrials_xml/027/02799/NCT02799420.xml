	<brief_summary>The purpose study conduct study genetic pathology , obtain pure cancer tissue mandatory . Although endoscopy biopsy gold standard diagnose gastric cancer , percentage cancer cell biopsy sample usually 30 % less . Recently , confocal laser endomicroscopy introduce real-time histopathologic diagnosis various cancer . In previous pilot study institution , pCLE-targeted biopsy provide superior result term proportion cancer cell biopsy sample compare WLE-targeted biopsy , especially gastric cancer undifferentiated histology . However , limitation small sample size . Therefore , investigator aim evaluate biopsy use probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy undifferentiated gastric cancer increase percentage cancer cell expression ratio tumor marker biopsy sample .</brief_summary>
