	<brief_summary>This feasibility study develop evaluate propose approach enrollment , sample collection , interview retention six-month vaccination period clinical trial : `` A scientific evaluation one two dos bivalent nonavalent prophylactic HPV vaccine '' ( 1DT ) currently development . These aspect assess quantitatively qualitatively measure effort need identify recruit study participant , participation rate study , retention rate six month , well collect information acceptability study procedure . To supplement assessment acceptability self-collected swab among old girl , parallel effort do end feasibility study . Combined , feasibility work allow modification design , approach method new trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Feasibility Study One-dose Clinical Trial ( 1DT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Selection study population recruitment . Costa Rica divide province divide canton , subdivide district . Districts conceptually divide minimal geo-statistical unit ( MGUs ) , territorial unit roughly equivalent block . These MGUs define National Institute Statistics Census ( INEC ) national census conducted 2011 ; digital map census data age gender MGUs available . The study area propose 1DT defined reach adequate catchment area order fulfill 1DT enrollment goal 20,000 girl . This defined area include ~125,000 girl region previous NCI/PEG study conduct well new province . For feasibility study , three urban three rural district three different province select : San Ignacio de Acosta Tibas San Jos√© ; Desamparados Cirri Sur Alajuela , Liberia San Antonio de Nicoya Guanacaste . MGUs district order randomly first MGU within selection visit . An experienced study outreach worker ( OW ) visit house within select MGU enumerate collect information girl age 12 16 reside MGU . At time , potentially-eligible girl present , OW invite participate feasibility study inform parent/legal guardian feasibility study , interested , assign participant study ID ( PID ) . The informed consent/assent process feasibility study conduct time . Once consented/assented , girl appoint medical office close house , expect attend feasibility study visit . If potential participant parent/legal guardian present , OW leave study material household arrange return another time discus study . The brochure include phone number case girl/parents want get additional information phone . Within MGU , five contact attempt make per house . Once house select MGU visit , few 15 household participant enrol , next random select MGUs visit ( note , define girl household instead individual girl since girl within household likely correlate response rate ) . If 15 household participant enrol visit originally-selected MGU , team move next district . This procedure repeat approximately 15 girl enrol district , MGU select visited , house MGU visit move another district , even 15 girl enrol , allow valid computation participation rate . Data number house approach , average number visit necessary collect information house ( maximum five visit ) , percentage house contact first visit , subsequent visit , number house possible obtain information , number girl age range , number girl potentially eligible determine home visit , number consent agree attend study visit , true number girl attend study visit , collect . Feasibility Study Clinic Visits . The guide principle feasibility clinic visit parallel clinic visit plan 1DT point randomization ( mock feasibility study ) . Consent/assent/enrolment medical history . The first feasibility study clinic visit start explanation propose informed consent assent 1DT ( word , mock consent procedure ) . Girls ask would willing participate study . A clinician obtain medical history girl parent/legal guardian , medical doctor considers necessary base medical history , perform physical examination confirm good general health . Reproductive history hormonal contraceptive use also obtain doctor . Questionnaire . A self-administered questionnaire administer . It query information year education , socio-economic status , menstrual history , sexual history , smoking . The questionnaire use evaluate acceptance self-administered questionnaire , perception sense confidentiality answer provide , ability understand question , percentage girl need help completeness response . Girls also present picture female genital anatomy order evaluate capacity identify self-collected swab insert . Urine . In 1DT , participant ask collect 15mL urine specimen urine pregnancy test store residual volume HPV testing . While conduct pregnancy test HPV test feasibility study , aim evaluate acceptability collect urine follow specific procedure need obtain urine sample suitable HPV testing . Spit . In 1DT , immunogenicity subcohort ask provide saliva sample spit cryovial use straw evaluation mucosal immune response . Thus , plan investigate acceptability sample . Blood . In 1DT , blood specimen collect participant two vaccination visit , twelve-month visit yearly . The purpose blood collection monitor immune response vaccination . We ask participant feasibility study provide total 10 mL blood . To assure participation retention rate trial negatively affect blood draw , refusal blood collect allow , document . Self-collected Cervicovaginal Sample . In 1DT , self-collected cervicovaginal sample use HPV test . Participants 15 old report sexual intercourse ask self-collect cervicovaginal sample . In order protect participant confidentiality , study staff administer detail instruction material sample collection participant 15 old irrespective sexual experience . All participant instruct collect sample appropriate ( define sexually active ) . Refusal collect specimen among sexually-active girl document . The self-collected cervicovaginal sample collect part feasibility study use assess adequacy sample . Participants ask impression study procedure time expend . At conclusion visit , receive voucher HPV vaccination local pharmacy , 1DT , vaccination would offer study visit . Six-month feasibility study visit . The second visit occur six month follow baseline study visit . Qualified staff conduct second feasibility study visit , include self-administered questionnaire address behavior time enrollment six-month study visit , blood specimen collection , among participant age 15 old report sexual intercourse , self-collected cervicovaginal sample . After answer question impression second visit procedure , receive voucher second dose vaccine . Biological specimen obtain participant study process stored evaluate quality sample generate de-identified pool specimen use quality control specimens various assay plan part overall plan One-dose trial . This could allow formal evaluation assay performance test batch effect future test maximize quality research conduct .</detailed_description>
