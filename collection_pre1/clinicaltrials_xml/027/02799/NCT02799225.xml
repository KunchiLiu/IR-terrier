	<brief_summary>Enterobacteria constitute family Gram negative bacillus gastrointestinal flora . These micro-organism frequently responsible nosocomial community-acquired infection , treatment essentially base use beta-lactam antibiotic . This class antibiotic comprise penicillin , cephalosporin , monobactams carbapenems . Carbapenems advantage possess broad antibacterial spectrum capacity resist hydrolytic action large number beta-lactamase , widespread inactivating enzyme . However , new enzyme , call carbapenemases , able confer resistance carbapenems either alone combination additional resistance mechanism loss membrane permeability overexpression efflux system , currently emerge world . Carbapenemases represent major public health problem risk therapeutic impasse high epidemic potential .</brief_summary>
