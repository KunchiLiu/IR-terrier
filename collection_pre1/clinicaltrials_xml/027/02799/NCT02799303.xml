	<brief_summary>In open randomize controlled trial , seek study whether prostate cancer screen use multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging ( mpMRI ) improve detection rate clinically-significant prostate cancer ( define Gleason score ≥7 prostate biopsy ) compare prostate cancer screen use prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) . The current paradigm prostate cancer screen relies upon initial PSA blood test , subsequent investigation drive serum PSA level . This model proven highly controversial due inability PSA level discern indolent aggressive form prostate cancer . As result , numerous government-sponsored body recommend PSA screening . Evidence suggest prostate cancer screen lead increase proportion men diagnose potentially curable prostate cancer . However , due inability PSA level accurately distinguish patient indolent lethal form prostate cancer , lead significant rate over-diagnosis indolent disease . Magnetic resonance image gain increasingly large role management patient clinically-localized prostate cancer include diagnosis patient abnormal PSA level , monitor patient active surveillance stag prior definitive intervention . MRI-based prostate cancer risk assessment show well distinguish clinically-significant insignificant tumor PSA test . Therefore , randomize control trial MRI-based prostate cancer screen PSA-based prostate cancer screen warrant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATONALE : Prostate cancer common non-cutaneous malignancy third lead cause cancer death among men Canada1 . In 1987 , prostate specific antigen introduced prostate cancer screening2 . Widespread adoption PSA screening result significantly increase number incident case significantly reduce number case metastatic disease presentation3 . Coinciding introduction PSA testing , prostate cancer mortality decrease approximately 40 % epidemiologic perspective4 . Approximately 45-70 % decline mortality attributable PSA-based prostate cancer screening5 . Several study examine whether screen prostate cancer use PSA test improve overall prostate cancer mortality . In particular , two large randomize study U.S. Europe conduct evaluate . Recently , U.S. Preventative Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) review study evaluate whether PSA use screen test . Current Recommendations PSA Screening USPSTF The USPSTF make recommendation regard effectiveness screening test asymptomatic patient assess evidence regard benefit harm intervention . The recent USPSTF guideline regard prostate cancer publish 20126 . The first component USPSTF assessment evaluation benefit early detection treatment prostate cancer . The review panel draw two large randomize controlled trial conduct assess effect PSA-based prostate cancer screen prostate cancer mortality : European Randomized Study Screening Prostate Cancer ( ERSPC ) 7 U.S.-based Prostate , Lung , Colorectal Ovarian ( PLCO ) Cancer Screening Trial8 . In recommendation guideline panel consider significant difference trial , large part due fact PSA widely adopt US study interval uptake Europe . As result , concern trial compare screen screening trial would unlikely find benefit even significant one existed9 . Regardless , panel conclude prostate cancer screen result avoidance 0 1 prostate cancer death per 1000 men screened6 , minimal benefit . The second component guideline panel 's assessment focus potential harm early detection treatment . They find evidence significant harm due false-positive PSA result confer risk psychological harm addition medical evaluation include biopsy6 . Further , consider , minimum , small harm associate prostate biopsy due pain , bleed infectious risk . The panel also conclude significant evidence least moderate overdiagnosis resultant overtreatment among patient undergo PSA-based screening . Due perceive lack benefit presence significant harm , USPSTF conclude , moderate certainty , benefit PSA-based screening outweigh harm thus recommend PSA-based screening prostate cancer6 . A major limitation task force receive input expert prostate cancer order minimize bias . While may improve objectivity review , many aspect understand prostate cancer lose . In response recommendation , American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) - large oncology association North America , develop consensus statement address USPSTF recommendation . ASCO Provisional Clinical Opinion Prostate Cancer Screening The ASCO provisional clinical opinion prostate cancer screen use PSA-testing base Agency Healthcare Research Quality systematic review10 . Despite draw data USPSTF , panel conclude men longer life expectancy ( great 10 year ) may benefit prostate cancer screen use PSA-testing11 . In men short life expectancy , PSA test discourage . Unlike USPSTF , ASCO panel place great weight result ERSPC , demonstrate significant reduction risk prostate cancer death men undergo prostate cancer screen . They note similar harm USPSTF , namely false-positive result prostate biopsy complication . Since publication opinion , data become available indicates relative reduction prostate cancer death PSA-based screening may large previously estimate . The mature data ERSPC 13 year follow up12 . Based data , absolute risk reduction prostate cancer mortality PSA screen 0.11 per 1000 person year 1.28 per 1000 men randomize . This risk reduction increase increase duration follow . Additional analysis show absolute risk reduction metastatic disease 3.1 per 1000 men randomized13 . In subgroup ERSPC long follow-up , absolute risk reduction prostate cancer mortality 4.0 per 1000 men randomized14 . This correspond number need screen 293 number need diagnose 12 order prevent one prostate cancer death . Underdiagnosis Prostate Cancer PSA In addition harm biopsy intervention , primary concern regard PSA-based prostate cancer screen inability distinguish patient indolent aggressive form disease . Prostate cancer screen program traditionally use serum PSA cut-off 4.0 ng/mL indicate abnormality . However , many men PSA value excess 4.0 ng/mL prostate cancer , even few clinically significant prostate cancer . Further , 25 % men PSA level less 4.0 ng/mL find high-grade prostate cancer , subject biopsy15 . Thus PSA-based prostate cancer screen lack sensitivity specificity identify men aggressive prostate cancer . As result , addition significant overdiagnosis overtreatment well recognize , risk underdiagnosis . Due USPSTF recommendation PSA-based prostate cancer screening , significant decrease PSA test perform primary care physicians16 . It predict complete discontinuation PSA-based screening would result prevention overdiagnosis 710,000 1,120,000 men United States 12 year period17 . However , would result 36,000 57,000 preventable death due prostate cancer time period . Thus , improve method prostate cancer screening may allow diminishment overdiagnosis avoid preventable death prostate cancer . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) The Prostate Multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging ( mpMRI ) increasingly large role management patient clinically-localized prostate cancer . MpMRI initially use stag test patient prostate cancer18 . Despite use would consider obsolete technology , Bezzi et al . demonstrated 1988 MRI could identify nodal metastasis accuracy 88 % could distinguish disease localized prostate invade beyond capsule accuracy 78 % among patient undergo prostatectomy18 . Since time , migration use MRI earlier disease process . In realm prostate cancer treatment , MRI use monitoring patient active surveillance follow prostate cancer diagnosis mean reduce prostate biopsy , incumbent risks19,20 . When performed evaluation patient elevate PSA level previous negative prostate biopsy , mpMRI show identify clinically significant prostate cancer would otherwise miss routine systematic biopsy21 . The use MRI ultrasound fusion image target prostate biopsy increase detection clinically significant prostate cancer limit diagnosis clinically insignificant prostate cancer22 . Among men abnormal PSA never undergone prostate biopsy , mpMRI demonstrate promise detection exclusion prostate cancer , use extensive prostate mapping biopsy ( median 41 core ) referent23 : AUC 0.27 ( 95 % CI 0.65-0.79 ) . In multivariable analysis independent cohort include age , family history , prior 5-alpha reductase inhibitor use , digital rectal examination finding , PSA level , PSA density , MRI score , MRI score predictive clinically significant ( Gleason score ≥7 ) prostate cancer among men without history previous prostate biopsy ( adjust OR 40.2 , p=0.01 ) 24 . While historically prostate MRI require use endorectal coil25 , recent advance MRI technology obviate need coil26 , thus reduce cost burden image . Pilot Study Examining Feasibility MRI Prostate Cancer Screening We recently conduct pilot study assess feasibility mpMRI initial prostate cancer screen test27 . Following newspaper base call volunteer , 319 men present possible inclusion study . Of , 120 eligible , 50 enrol due limitation funding , 47 complete study protocol . Serum PSA testing , mpMRI , digital rectal examination , systematic ( +/- target ) prostate biopsy perform men . Prostate cancer identify 18 47 men ( 38.3 % ) . MpMRI ( AUC 0.81 , 95 % CI 0.67-0.94 ) significantly outperform PSA ( AUC 0.67 , 95 % CI 0.52-0.84 ) prediction prostate cancer . In multivariable analysis include age , digital rectal examination finding , PSA MRI score , mpMRI significant predictor presence prostate cancer ( adjust OR 2.7 , 95 % CI 1.4-5.4 ) . These finding persist sought predict clinically significant prostate cancer ( Gleason ≥7 ; adjust OR 3.5 , 95 % CI 1.5-8.3 ) . To good evaluate use mpMRI prostate , large , randomize study compare efficacy mpMRI diagnose clinically significant , aggressive prostate cancer , compare conventional PSA screening require .</detailed_description>
