	<detailed_description>Diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) account approximately 115,000 hospital discharge per year United States . Appropriate management life-threatening clinical presentation require timely meticulous intervention , include avoidance hypokalemia , hypoglycemia DKA recurrence . However , clinical management continue less ideal ; example , recent retrospective chart audit patient admit large teach hospital primary diagnosis DKA , 75 % place inappropriate insulin regimen . This evidence practice gap may bridge use computer simulation training . In simulated training environment , trainee opportunity manage uncommon important clinical presentation may otherwise experience training , without risk patient harm . A recent systematic review Cook et al . analyze 405 study compare simulation-based intervention intervention health care professional various discipline . The author find simulation improve knowledge [ pool effect size 1.20 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 1.04-1.35 ) ] skill [ pooled effect size 1.09 ( 95 % CI,1.03-1.16 ) ] . Another systematic review analyze 50 study compare virtual patient simulation intervention find large positive effect virtual patient simulation compare intervention ( pooled effect size 0.94 ( 95 % CI 0.69-1.19 ) knowledge outcome , 0.80 ( 95 % CI 0.52-1.08 ) clinical reason 0.90 ( 95 % CI 0.61-1.19 ) skill ) . Although many study compare simulation intervention , study directly compare different simulation-based intervention . Two systematic review effectiveness simulation demonstrate repetitive practice superior single-use instructional modality . Few study include review report much practice necessary obtain long-term skill retention . These systematic review also demonstrate training adapted individualized performance associate well learn outcome . What remain unclear , however , locus control define parameter individualize learning . One randomize control trial compare self-regulated learn instructor-regulated learning intervention resident train use lumbar puncture simulation reveal self-regulated learning lead superior long-term skill retention 3 month . As focused repetitive practice one key element deliberate practice , one would postulate self-regulated learner higher chance achieve superior result give optimize amount practice ; however , yet assess simulator learn environment . The effectiveness unsupervised versus supervise simulation curriculum yield conflicting result . A systematic review compare different simulation modality reveal group instruction associate well outcome ( pooled effect size -0.22 ) , whereas previous systematic review randomize trial compare simulation educational modality reveal group instruction associate positive learning effect ( pooled effect size 0.72 ) . One could assume supervise learn superior unsupervised learning , former provide learner opportunity continuous informative feedback , key element deliberate practice , order enhance continue practice . However , formally test simulation-based education . Self-regulated learning supervise versus unsupervised learning simulation education require exploration . The investigator conduct 2-by-2 factorial cluster randomize controlled trial , compare impact ( 1 ) coach versus non-coached administration , ( 2 ) preselected number practice case versus self-selected number practice case , medical student resident score computer-based simulation DKA management . By utilize theory deliberate practice , investigator hypothesize participant use simulator supervise environment would score superiorly simulator . In addition , hypothesize participant randomize self regulate learning would score superiorly simulator .</detailed_description>
