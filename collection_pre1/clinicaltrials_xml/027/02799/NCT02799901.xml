	<brief_summary>Combining nivolumab conventional multisite high dose radiotherapy seem interesting approach could increase antitumoral effect nivolumab increase diversity quantity tumoral antigen presentation thanks radiotherapy . Multifractionated high dose radiotherapy ( HR ) target various tumor site could also increase occurrence tumor mutation diversity T-cell receptor repertoire intratumoral T cell . The purpose study combine nivolumab 3 fraction HR one metastasis tumor site ( defined skin/muscle , thoracic , abdomen , bone , ) . The investigator hypothesize combine nivolumab multisite , multifractionated HR increase overall survival rate 1 year compare publish data nivolumab alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent progress make advanced melanoma drug target immune system ipilimumab target CTLA-4 nivolumab target PD-1 . Some case report preclinical data suggest antitumoral immune response immune check point inhibitor ( ipilimumab nivolumab well ) could enhance associate massive tumoral antigen release blood stream , due local treatment high dose radiotherapy ( HR ) . The first rigorous scientific demonstration phenomenon do Demaria et al . They show irradiation xenograft tumor could induce decrease tumoral growth non-irradiated xenograt tumor . This effect due immune response irradiation occur immune system modulate CTLA-4 inhibition . In experience CTLA4 radiation action synergistic . Dovedi et al . also report target PD-1/PD-L1 pathway great anti-tumor efficacy concomitant radiotherapy give especially radiotherapy multifractionated . Very interestingly fractionate radiotherapy also induce huge increase tumoral PD-L1 expression three time 5 day begin radiotherapy . This could explain synergistic impact strategy . At least eight clinical study ongoing , test combination CTLA-4 blockade radiotherapy metastatic melanoma tumor , various treatment schedule either ipilimumab ( 3 10 mg/kg ) radiotherapy ( ipilimumab , fraction 6 8 Gy ; total body irradiation treatment one metastasis ) . One study ( NCT01565837 ) phase II study analyse efficacy 10mg/kg ipilimumab ( every 3 week ) associate HR metastatic site oligometastatic patient ( &lt; 6 metastasis ) , reflect minority metastatic melanoma patient . Such strategy high interest take account putative tumoral heterogeneity could lead failure association nivolumab irradiation one tumor site . The investigator propose combine nivolumab 3 fraction HR one metastasis tumor site ( defined skin/muscle , thoracic , abdomen , bone , ) .They chosen 3 fraction instead 1 tumor site preclinical data mouse show one fraction less efficient several fraction stimulate immune system kill tumoral cell . The increase number fraction could also lead increase diversity tumoral antigen release blood stream could also favor diversity T-cell receptor repertoire intratumoral T cell . In protocol dose constraint tissue type easily achieve 3 X 6 Gy schedule without excess toxicity . In conclusion present protocol aim increase quantity diversity release tumoral antigen provide multisite , multifractionated HR nivolumab treatment advance untreated melanoma patient . The investigator hypothesize combine nivolumab multisite , multifractionated HR increase overall survival rate 1 year compare publish data nivolumab alone .</detailed_description>
