	<brief_summary>As iodinate contrast medium ( CM ) widely use current medical practice , contrast induce acute kidney injury ( CI-AKI ) important issue . Previously , many guideline suggest prophylaxis protocol use 0.9 % saline CM administrate high risk patient . However , recent study show 0.9 % saline might induce metabolic acidosis due supra-physiologic chloride component , therefore renal vasoconstriction . In spite protective effect volume expansion saline infusion , renal vasoconstriction might conflict effect renal function , hypoxic injury suspect main cause CI-AKI . In contrast 0.9 % saline , balance salt solution physiologic level chloride neutral pH . Also , recent study prove preventive effect balance salt solution AKI several clinical setting . Hence , investigator plan prospective randomized control trial compare 0.9 % saline balance salt solution prevent CI-AKI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Balanced Salt Solution Versus 0.9 % Saline Infusion Prevention Contrast-induced Acute Kidney Injury ( BASIC Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iodinated contrast medium ( CM ) widely use various diagnostic therapeutic intervention . Coronary angiography contrast enhance computed tomography representative medical procedure CM administration necessary , usage recently extend . Also , U.S sale medical image CM increase . Although iodinated CM useful role many medical procedure , CM well know renal side effect , contrast induce acute kidney injury ( CI-AKI ) . CI-AKI one lead cause iatrogenic acute kidney injury ( AKI ) . Moreover , CI-AKI know independent risk factor short- long term morbidity mortality . Considering current rise incidence CI-AKI , prevention important issue . The incidence CI-AKI 5 % 25 % accord presence risk factor renal failure , diabetes mellitus , heart failure , old age concomitant use nephrotoxic medication . Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) establish risk factor CI-AKI therefore several guideline recommend prophylaxis CI-AKI patient creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) 60mL/min receives CM administration . In guideline , generally recommend high risk patient receive isotonic crystalloid solution consider take N-acetylcysteine , although still debate benefit . Several clinical study compare 0.9 % saline sodium bicarbonate solution effectiveness CI-AKI prevention , superiority show use sodium bicarbonate solution . Hence , organization currently use 0.9 % saline CI-AKI prophylaxis due wide availability . However , several study show 0.9 % saline supra-physiologic dose chloride induce metabolic acidosis contribute renal vasoconstriction impairment estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) . Double blind , randomize clinical human study prove problem less pronounced use balance salt solution , physiologic level chloride neutral pH . Also , recent prospective pilot study suggest use chloride restrictive solution , rather use chloride rich solution , fluid resuscitation critically ill patient reduce AKI . Considering finding , large scale cohort study randomize controlled trial ongoing prove preventive effect balance salt solution AKI 0.9 % saline . In conclusion , state , use 0.9 % saline CI-AKI prophylaxis might limited benefit volume expansion . Considering component , additional physiologic advantage use balanced salt solution could achieve . In order ass hypothesis , investigator plan multicenter prospective randomize control open-label trial comparing balance salt solution 0.9 % saline prevent CI-AKI . The primary end-point study event CI-AKI , define relative ( ≥25 % ) fix ( ≥0.5mg/dL ) increase serum creatinine baseline value assess 48 hour CM use . The secondary end-point decrease eGFR 50 % baseline eGFR within 48 hour initiation dialysis mortality , 1 6 month CM exposure . For purpose , least 830 subject would require group type I error rate 2.5 % type II error 20 % , give 20 % drop-out rate study period .</detailed_description>
