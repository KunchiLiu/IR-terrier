	<brief_title>Clinical , Biochemical Haemodynamic Effects Large-volume Paracentesis ( LVP ) Inflammatory Situations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ascites one common complication advance liver cirrhosis . Large-volume paracentesis ( LVP ) widely use symptomatic intervention remove large amount peritoneal fluid . Despite low rate interventional-associated complication like fistula non life-threatening bleeding LVP induce impairment circulatory function . The hypothesis haemodynamic change detect non-invasive monitoring haemodynamic change could associate postinterventional organ dysfunction complication . Additionally investigator hypothesize paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction could also associate present clinical laboratory sign inflammation infection could influence increase viable non-viable bacterial translocation .</detailed_description>
