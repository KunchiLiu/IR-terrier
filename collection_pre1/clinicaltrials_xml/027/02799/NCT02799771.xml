	<detailed_description>Pre capillary pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) may present patient diffuse interstitial lung disease . In context , PH represent important factor morbidity mortality patient . As HYPID , main purpose HYPID-2 determine predictive factor mortality within cohort incident patient ( i.e patient include within 6 month PH diagnosis ) . In order reach aim , study include evaluation base exams conduct routine follow-up incident patient . Each incident patient follow 2 year least .</detailed_description>
