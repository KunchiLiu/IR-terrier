	<brief_summary>Objective : The study 's main purpose evaluate compare clinical radiographic outcome Biodentine light-activated calcium hydroxide based-liner ( Ultra-Blend plusÂ® ) indirect pulp treatment ( IPT ) liner , dentin-pulp complex vital primary molar carious lesion approach pulp . Study design : 80 four-to-eight year-old patient enrol Mexican University Pediatric Dentistry Clinic . A split-mouth design trial conduct order compare IPT intervention 160 bilateral primary teeth , without sign symptom irreversibly inflame degenerative pulp tissue . Teeth treat restore preformed crown single session , closely followed-up 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A Split-mouth clinical trial design select . Clinical Procedures : IPT procedure carry three pediatric dentistry resident ( E.K.C.G. , R.A.V.V. , J.M.A.R . ) , previously train clinical setting pilot sample 10 similar child patient . Study participant receive local anesthesia rubber dam isolation , disinfect , follow remove carious peripheral dentin high speed tungsten-carbide bur # 3 , air-water spray . Then , soft dentin layer carefully remove sharply-edged sterilized hand excavator , base tactile visual standard , leave hard dentin adjacent pulp ceiling . The cavity thoroughly rinsed water dry sterilize cotton pellet ; special disinfection protocol apply . The next step consist placement correspondent liner remanent carious dentin layer , follow manufacturer ' instruction , accord randomly assignment scheme previously describe . In case control group , liner cure undr 20 second light exposure . All treat molar restore stainless steel preform crown ( 3M ESPE ) cement glass ionomer ( Ketac-Cem , 3M ESPE ) . One week later , procedure repeat opposite tooth contrary IPT agent .</detailed_description>
