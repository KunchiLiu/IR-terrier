	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate clinical response toxicity recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein ( sEphB4-HSA ) ( initial dose 15 mg/kg every 2 week ) participant Kaposi sarcoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety sEphB4-HSA participant Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) . II . To determine trough level exposure sEphB4-HSA correlate tumor response . III . To characterize pharmacodynamics sEphB4-HSA correlate effect clinical response . IV . Effects viral replication gene expression human herpes virus-8 ( HHV-8 ) . V. Changes vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) -Notch-EphrinB2 angiogenic pathway . VI . Effects immune response modulation . VII . Effects tumor cell apoptosis proliferation . VIII . Effects sEphB4-HSA human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) plasma viral load participant HIV . IX . To archive peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) tissue sample use conjunction sample collect subsequent trial sEphB4-HSA future study include identification biomarkers predictive response . X . To evaluate clinical response toxicity sEphB4-HSA ( increased dose 10 mg/kg every week ) participant KS . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe baseline quality life ( QOL ) score , use functional assessment HIV Infection ( FAHI ) + Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) questionnaire , participant KS , explore change QOL participant treatment sEphB4-HSA . OUTLINE : Patients receive recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 15 . Patients disease progression 2 course experienced toxicity may receive recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month ; patient partial response well follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
