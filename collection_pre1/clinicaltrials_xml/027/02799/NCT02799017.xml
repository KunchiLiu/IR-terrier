	<brief_title>Phonological Treatment Paired With Intensive Speech Therapy Promotes Reading Recovery Chronic Aphasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 20 client enrol study , 10 control group 10 experimental group assign random order . All client give standardized test pre post treatment ass comprehension , expressive , read write skill . Participants MRI report collect understand lesion sit language outcome . Both experimental control group receive individual , group read hour . Participants experimental group receive hour individual phonology therapy . The participant control group receive traditional individual therapy . Both group receive group hour read aloud . Experimental Group Therapy involve visual auditory drill . It also structure , sequential , repetitive , cumulative . The sound target treatment separated five set include 5 sound - one short vowel four consonant . For consonant two sound , initially hard sound taught . The soft sound teach participant taught different spelling rule ( i.e . `` silent ' e ' '' ) . Each set target three week mastery . When teach new set sound , clinician teach participant placement articulator name letter . The participant copy letter set receive auditory bombardment sound . During auditory bombardment , participant encourage produce sound . Procedure : The participant experimental group receive hour phonology treatment , hour group therapy , hour reading . The participant control group receive hour individual therapy , hour read hour group therapy traditional setting . Both group work write , generative name group time , however , experimental group focus self-cueing sound learn individual session . While control group simply follow semantic feature analysis retrieve name . Both group read read aloud depend level . The participant experimental group teach consonant vowel course 16 week . Visual Drills Step 1 : Production individual sound - The clinician show subject letter subject name letter produce correspond sound . If participant produce accurate response , participant provide visual placement sound . If target still produce , clinician provide correct response participant imitate clinician . They repeat production three time , write letter , produce letter name three time . Auditory Drills *For auditory task , clinician 's articulator cover . In section clinician produce sound mouth cover subject repeat sound hear write corresponding letter paper . If participant still respond incorrectly , clinician write target letter , name letter , participant copy repeat accurate response . Each sound target 5 time per session . Step 2 : Sound letter identification/letter name -The participant provide sheet letter set target . The clinician produce one sound , client repeat ensure comprehension , client identify letter associate sound point . In addition , participant say letter name . If participant get incorrect , clinician tell participant sound correspond letter identify clinician repeat target sound provide placement cue ( i.e . remove cover articulator ) . If participant still respond incorrectly , clinician identify target letter participant copy response . Each sound target 5 time per session . Step 3 : Initial sound discrimination - The clinician ask participant word start certain sound . ( i.e . `` Does 'bag ' start /d/ ? '' ) If participant responds incorrectly , clinician explain response incorrect repeat stimulus provide placement cue ( i.e . remove cover articulator ) . If participant still respond incorrectly , clinician show write word repeat stimulus . If participant still respond incorrectly , clinician provide accurate response explanation . This task consist five trial . Initial sound identification - When participant reach 90 % accuracy initial sound discrimination task , clinician provide participant CVC word verbally ask identify initial sound point letter sheet contain sound within set naming letter . If participant responds incorrectly , clinician explain response incorrect repeat stimulus provide placement cue ( i.e . remove cover articulator ) . If participant still unable , clinician reduce amount choice three . If participant still unable complete task , clinician provide correct response explanation . There five trial task . Initial sound generation - Once participant reach 90 % accuracy initial sound identification task , clinician verbally provide participant CVC word ask participant produce initial sound stimuli name letter . If participant unable produce initial sound , clinician repeat word mouth uncover show participant articulatory placement . If still unable produce sound , clinician isolate initial sound mouth uncovered . There five trial task . Blending &amp; Segmenting Drills — This introduced subject learn one consonant vowel . Step 4 : Segmentation - The clinician provide participant CV VC word consist two letter set . The participant repeat word segment two sound . When participant reach 90 % accuracy , participant repeat CVC word segment three sound . Step 5 : Blending - When participant reach 90 % accuracy segmentation task , clinician provide participant two sound set two second pause . The participant repeat two sound isolation blend together . If participant unable blend sound , clinician produce isolation one second pause . If participant still unable produce target response , clinician repeat sound isolation one second pause produce target word participant repeat target . When participant reach 90 % accuracy blend two sound , participant complete task three sound ( CVC ) . There five trial task . Step 6 : Reading CVC Words - Once participant reach 80 % accuracy identifying , produce , blending , participant read aloud CVC word contain sound targeted therapy . Writing CVC Words Dictation - Once participant reach 80 % accuracy identifying , produce , blending , participant write CVC word dictation give clinician ( word contain target sound ) . Group Therapy : Step1 : Generative Naming Participants ask generate item give verb noun category . They encourage write item read use phonology treatment protocol . The control group follow traditional generative naming method . The control group give phonemic cue need recall word however first option . Clients ask write sentence read sentence use generated list give action verb noun . Step 2 : Picture name - The participant provide picture initial sound one target sound . If participant unable name picture , clinician instruct participant try write word initial letter . The clinician inform participant first letter one target sound . If participant unable write , clinician provide 3 choice , target letter . If participant able produce first letter , clinician instruct produce sound corresponds letter . If participant still unable produce target response , clinician expand phonemic cue syllabic cue . If participant still unable produce correct response , clinician provide semantic cue another cue work participant . Reading — All client give 15 sentence work read . The sentence target sound taught individual therapy . Clients read read volunteer .</detailed_description>
