	<brief_summary>Cabotegravir develop treatment human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) 1 infection . Specifically , develop component 2-drug maintenance regimen ( post-induction viral suppression ) include rilpivirine . Rilpivirine require food optimal absorption ; therefore recommend intake cabotegravir plan Phase 3 treatment study food regardless fat calorie content , administer along rilpivirine . This single-center , randomize , open-label , two-way crossover study healthy adult subject assess effect high fat meal single dose pharmacokinetics CAB 30 mg . Approximately , 24 subject enrol study screen 30 day . Twelve subject least 10 hour fast randomized receive single dose cabotegravir orally ( Schedule ' A ' ) . The remain 12 subject receive single dose cabotegravir orally along high fat meal ( Schedule ' B ' ) . After 15 day , subject earlier undergoing 'Schedule A ' switched 'Schedule B ' undergoing 'Schedule B ' undergo 'Schedule A ' . All subject follow 30 day day receive first dose cabotegravir evaluate effect high fat meal pharmacokinetics cabotegravir .</brief_summary>

Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation post menopausal status prior study enrolment 2 . Reproductive potential agrees follow one option list modified list highly effective method avoid pregnancy female reproductive potential ( FRP ) 30 day prior first dose study medication last dose study medication completion follow visit . The investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method contraception Capable give sign informed consent include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase , bilirubin &lt; =1.5x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) .

A prior history seizure , seizure free period least 2 year , antiepileptic , may consider enrolment investigator believe risk seizure recurrence low . All case prior seizure history discuss medical monitor prior enrolment Any medical condition , judgment investigator medical monitor , could jeopardize integrity data derive subject safety subject . This include limited pre exist condition interferes normal gastrointestinal anatomy motility could interfere absorption , metabolism , and/or excretion study drug . Unable refrain use prescription non prescription drug , include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 half life ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication , unless opinion investigator GSK medical monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define average weekly intake &gt; 14 drink male &gt; 7 drink female . One drink equivalent 12 gram alcohol : 12 ounce ( 360 milliliter ( mL ) beer , 5 ounce ( 150 mL ) wine 1.5 ounce ( 45 mL ) 80 proof distil spirit Urinary cotinine level indicative smoke history regular use tobacco nicotine containing product within 30 day prior screen . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator medical monitor , contraindicate participation . Positive hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , positive hepatitis B core antibody ( HBcAb ) negative hepatitis B surface antibody ( HBsAb ) screen within 3 month prior first dose study treatment . Positive hepatitis C antibody test result screen within 3 month prior first dose study treatment . A positive pre study drug/alcohol screen . A positive test HIV antibody . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . The subject 's systolic blood pressure outside range 90 140 millimeter mercury ( mmHg ) , diastolic blood pressure outside range 45 90 mmHg The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 half life twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) ; however , subject participate another clinical trial time screen , time first dose within time period list Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day</criteria>
