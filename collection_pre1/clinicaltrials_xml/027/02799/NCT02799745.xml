	<criteria>Histologically proven adenocarcinoma prostate diagnose ( ≥10 core biopsy ) within 6 month screen . The biopsy use diagnosis must submit central pathology review . Prostate cancer categorize ( determined central pathology review ) low risk define T1cT2a , PSA &lt; 10 , N0 , M0 ( presume N0 , M0 CT/bone scan do due low risk metastasis ) , GS ≤ 6 , ECOG status ≤2 estimate life expectancy &gt; 5 year OR intermediate risk define T2bT2c , PSA &lt; 20 , N0 , M0 ( presume N0 , M0 CT/bone scan do ) , GS ≤7 ( 3+4 pattern ) , ECOG status ≤ 2 estimate life expectancy &gt; 5 year . Prostate cancer categorize ( determined central pathology review ) low risk category ( T1c , GS ≤6 , PSA &lt; 10 ng/mL , few 3 prostate biopsy core positive , ≤50 % cancer core , PSA density &lt; 0.15 ng/mL/g ) include . Ability swallow study drug comply study requirement throughout study Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) /Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) approve write Informed Consent privacy language per national regulation must obtain subject legally authorize representative prior studyrelated procedure Throughout study , male subject female partner childbearing potential must use two acceptable method birth control ( one must include condom barrier method contraception ) start screen continue throughout study period three month final study drug administration . Two acceptable method birth control thus include follow : 1 . Condom ( barrier method contraception ) AND 2 . One follow require : . Established use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception female partner ; ii . Placement intrauterine device intrauterine system female partner ; iii . Additional barrier method : Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam / gel / film / cream / suppository female partner ; iv . Tubal ligation female partner . Must donate sperm start screen throughout study period 90 day final study drug administration . Prior radiotherapy , surgery , chemotherapy , hormonal therapy prostate cancer Very low risk category ( T1c , GS ≤6 , PSA &lt; 10 ng/mL , few 3 prostate biopsy core positive , ≤50 % cancer core , PSA density &lt; 0.15 ng/mL/g ) Prior transurethral resection prostate prior transurethral microwave thermotherapy prostate Use oral glucocorticoid within 1 month screening Use 5 alpha reductase inhibitor within 1 month screen total use , within last two year prior screen , &gt; 3 month Presence metastatic disease History seizure condition may predispose seizure time past .
