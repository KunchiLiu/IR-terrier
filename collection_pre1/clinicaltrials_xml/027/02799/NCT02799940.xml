	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) involve respiratory failure different cause , common pathologic manifestation form inflammatory pulmonary edema . Histopathological examination tissue obtain patient ARDS suggest pathology heterogeneous involves 3 phase : exudative , inflammatory , fibroproliferative . Such alteration associate decreased lung compliance lead increased pressure airways mechanical ventilation ( MV ) become pronounced increase severity ARDS , consequent respiratory mechanic thus show determinant patient outcome . In addition , compute tomography ( CT ) reveal heterogeneous pattern lung injury , area normal lung intersperse morphologically altered region , among abnormality ground-glass opacification consolidation frequent . It perform quantitative assessment ARDS mean CT , thus enable correlation pathologic detail physiologic clinical parameter well patient outcome . From , investigator hypothesize patient ARDS , great involvement oxygenation high mechanical alteration correlate advanced consolidation CT scan . Therefore , primary objective study determine correlation extent oxygenation ( assessed PaO2/FiO2 ratio ) degree consolidation ( total CO ) CT scan . The secondary objective : ( 1 ) determine correlation drive pressure total CO evidence CT ; ( 2 ) determine correlation static pressure total CO ; ( 3 ) determine correlation static compliance total CO ; ( 4 ) determine correlation oxygenation index total CO ; ( 5 ) determine correlation lung injury score ( LIS ) total CO ; ( 6 ) determine correlation ventilator free day total CO ; ( 7 ) determine independent variable associate total CO ; ( 8 ) determine difference CT respect total lung-disease score [ total CO plus total value ground-glass opacification ( total GC ) ] survivor nonsurvivors .</detailed_description>
