	<brief_summary>Objective : To develop evaluate technology-augmented self-monitoring model use randomize controlled trial demonstrate whether patient co-morbid type 2 diabetes mellitus hypertension improve glycemic blood pressure control , adherence medication regimen , relevant outcome use tablet-based consumer health information technology ( CHIT ) support self-monitoring self-management chronic condition . Design : A two-group , randomize controlled trial follow-up assessment 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 week baseline evaluation . Setting : Patients ' home . Participants : Two hundred ninety-six adult patient type 2 diabetes mellitus hypertension receive health care local community health service network major hospital recruit . Interventions : Participants technology-augmented self-monitoring model ( intervention group ) use tablet-based , interactive touch screen self-monitoring system monitor manage chronic condition . The system design augment patient ' ability ass , record , review health sign provide text- , audio- , video-based resource support disease self-care . The participant usual-care group perform conventional self-monitoring . Outcome measure : The primary outcome glycemic control measure change HbA1c , blood pressure control assess change systolic diastolic blood pressure , medication compliance . The secondary outcome adherence diabetes hypertension self-care activity knowledge diabetes hypertension . Implication : This study improve understand clinical value CHITs chronic disease self-monitoring self-management .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subject recruitment : The person-in-charge/managers department hospitals/the health service center go in-house medical document identify adult diagnosis type 2 diabetes hypertension invite attend information session , project 's lead PI ( Dr. Calvin Or ) research assistant introduce study ; determine eligibility base self-reported demographic data , health information , and/or medical record ; collect contact information . Later , research assistant telephone eligible patient schedule first visit home enrollment . Intervention : The participant randomize intervention group give tablet-based , interactive touch-screen self-monitoring system free charge perform disease self-monitoring home . The objective system empower patient ' ability self-monitor improve self-care adherence medication compliance enable access various e-support , information , resource , self-monitoring tool timely manner . It run 10-inch touch-screen tablet computer program connect 2-in-1 blood pressure glucose monitor . Measurement modules available assess record blood pressure , pulse , blood glucose level . The assessment record fully automate retrieve review structured table chart . Patients determine whether assessment value deviate critical level may need attention base `` normal value range '' indicated system . The system also module provide text- video-based learning resource related cause prevention type 2 diabetes hypertension , self-care , salt sodium intake , diet , action plan ( e.g. , appropriate action response symptom ) , exercise , stress management . The care information video capability allow patient easily learn self-monitor self-manage . In addition , system reminder function program emit audible reminder predetermine time alert patient take prescribed medication . A secured web portal ( http : //selfcare.imse.hku.hk/ ) available authorize , non-patient user caregiver family remotely review monitor assessment value key patient health sign use mobile device computer . Randomization : Participants stratify four group base HbA1c systolic blood pressure measurement : ( ) HbA1c ≤ 8 % systolic BP ≤ 159 mm Hg , ( ii ) HbA1c ≤ 8 % systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg , ( iii ) HbA1c &gt; 8 % systolic BP ≤ 159 mm Hg , ( iv ) HbA1c &gt; 8 % systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg . These cut-offs group set base previous study ( 2 , 3 ) clinical judgement . Within stratum , patient block-randomized study group use randomly permute block sequentially number , opaque , seal envelope . The randomization allocation process base practical guide permute block randomization stratify trial , describe Doig Simpson ( 4 ) , handle centrally researcher response telephone call .</detailed_description>
