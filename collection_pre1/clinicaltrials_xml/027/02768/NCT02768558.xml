	<brief_summary>Patients Stage III unresectable non-small cell lung cancer receive thoracic radiation , cisplatin etoposide follow nivolumab placebo give every 2 week year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin Etoposide Plus Radiation Followed By Nivolumab/Placebo For Locally Advanced NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare Overall Survival ( OS ) patient Stage III unresectable non-small cell lung cancer treat without nivolumab follow concurrent chemoradiation . II . To compare Progression-Free Survival ( PFS ) accord RECIST 1.1 criterion patient Stage III unresectable non-small cell lung cancer treat without nivolumab follow concurrent chemoradiation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically ( histologically cytologically ) proven diagnosis NSCLC unresectable , medically inoperable disease , patient refuse resection stage IIIA stage IIIB disease ( AJCC 7th edition ) History/physical examination within 30 day prior registration CT scan IV contrast ( CT scan without contrast acceptable IV contrast medically contraindicate ) lung upper abdomen adrenal gland within 60 day prior registration ( recommend within 30 day prior registration ) MRI brain contrast ( CT contrast MRI medically contraindicate ) within 60 day prior registration ; note : use intravenous contrast require MRI CT ( unless medically contraindicate ) . Wholebody FDGPET/CT within 60 day prior registration ; Note : patient need separate CT chest upper abdomen contrast PET/CT image include high quality CT chest contrast . Age ≥ 18 year The trial open gender Zubrod Performance status 01 Forced Expiratory Volume one second ( FEV1 ) &gt; 1.2 liter ; Diffusion Capacity Lung Carbon Monoxide ( DLCO ) ≥ 50 % predicted Patients must least 3 week prior thoracotomy ( perform ) ; prior thoracotomy measurable disease image must present Negative serum pregnancy test within three day prior registration woman childbearing potential An archived tumor block punch instead block must available submission PDL1 analysis . If archived tumor block sample ship study , two 3mm punch core needle biopsy block may provide analysis . NOTE : core excisional biopsy require study . Fine needle aspirate ( FNA ) cytology specimen adequate PDL1 analysis . Agreement woman childbearing potential use highly effective contraception receipt study drug 161 day ( 23 week ) last dose nivolumab/placebo men receive nivolumab/placebo sexually active woman childbearing potential use highly effective contraception receipt study drug 31 week last dose nivolumab/placebo . Definitive clinical radiological evidence metastatic disease Prior current invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer , localize bladder prostate cancer ) unless disease free minimum 2 year ( example , carcinoma situ breast , oral cavity , cervix permissible ) Prior radiotherapy region study cancer would result overlap radiation therapy field . For example , patient prior breast radiotherapy treatment would likely exclude . Prior systemic treatment antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCTLA4 antibody , antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation immune checkpoint pathway Known immunosuppressive disease , example HIV infection history bone marrow transplant chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) exacerbation respiratory illness require hospitalization preclude study therapy time registration . COPD require chronic oral steroid therapy Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization within last 6 month Transmural myocardial infarction within last 6 month Acute bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time registration History symptomatic p previously establish interstitial lung disease Positive test hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBV sAg ) hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid ( HCV antibody ) indicate acute chronic infection ; History severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody allergy study drug component As potential hepatic toxicity nivolumab , drug predisposition hepatotoxicity use caution patient treat nivolumabcontaining regimen Pregnancy , nursing female woman childbearing potential men sexually active willing/able use medically acceptable form contraception ; exclusion necessary treatment involve study may significantly teratogenic .</criteria>
