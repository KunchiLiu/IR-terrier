	<brief_summary>Background : 1 . Burden : The prevalence stunt among under-five child Bangladesh &gt; 55 % 1997 , reduce 41.9 % 2011 . This reduction take 14 year achieve exist intervention , till today Bangladesh remain among country high stunt prevalence . 2 . Knowledge gap : In Lancet series Maternal Child Nutrition , Bhutta et al ( 2013 ) model effect 10 direct intervention live saved economic cost 34 country contain 90 % child stunt growth . Their finding suggest 90 % coverage , intervention could cut under-5 year mortality 15 % avert one-fifth stunting . The total additional annual cost estimate $ 9.6 billion . There dearth primary research , however , determine feasible , effective bundle intervention develop country . 3 . Relevance : This study review test different set nutrition-specific intervention bundle cohort pregnant woman subsequent impact length-for-age Z score ( LAZ ) offspring pregnancy . Hypothesis : Five select nutrition-specific intervention implement early pregnancy first two year child 's life different bundle cause shift 0.4 mean HAZ score among child 24 month age compare comparison arm . Methods : The investigator propose community-based randomize trial ( CRCT ) evaluate effectiveness different combination five select nutrition-specific intervention identify best combination improve childhood HAZ . Selected intervention include prenatal nutrition supplementation ; intensive counsel prenatal nutrition , exclusive breastfeeding timely complementary feeding ; complementary food supplementation 6-23 month . The propose study area Habiganj district , Sylhet division . 125 cluster ( ~2000 population ~450 household ) select 12 homogenous union 2 adjacent sub-districts . The cluster randomly assign one 5 study arm . Data would collect baseline follow , include nutritional intake anthropometric measurement mother offspring . Primary outcome measure/variable would mean HAZ offspring 24 month . Secondary outcome variable include nutritional intake pregnancy , maternal weight gain , exclusive breast feed up-to 6 month , birth weight . Implications : The investigator expect result serve inform shape future health policy decision related promotion maternal child health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Design Methods The investigator propose community-based cluster randomize trial ( CRCT ) evaluate effectiveness different combination 5 select prenatal post-natal nutrition-specific intervention improve mean HAZ score among 24 month old child . The intervention test different combination are- : 1 . Prenatal nutrition-specific counsel 2 . Prenatal nutrition supplementation 3 . Intensive counsel exclusive breast-feeding postnatal first six month 4 . Supplementation complementary food 6-23 month continue breastfeed 5 . Complementary feeding counselling . The three counsel intervention ( Behaviour change communication , BCC ) universal intervention arm two type supplementation provide different combination explain elsewhere . This design allow test synergy , help determine effect size select individual intervention , evaluate much effect prenatal complementary food supplementation would improve length-for-age z score ( LAZ ) . The cohort pregnant woman child pregnancy followed-up 32 month intervention period . Sample Size Calculation Power-based sample size estimation procedure adopt . Assumptions use sample size calculation include : - Mean HAZ 18-23 month old child comparison arm -2.0 standard deviation 1 ( BDHS 2011 ) - Expected effect size 0.4 shift mean HAZ score intervention arm compare comparison . - 80 % power , 5 % alpha , ratio 4 intervention 1 comparison arm 1:1:1:1:1 . - Intra-cluster correlation coefficient 0.06 ( BDHS 2011 ) . - Non response lost-to-follow 30 % Using SATA clustersampsi command , sample size per study arm calculate 175 child 18-24 month age . 7 child 25 cluster ( ~2000 population ) would follow ~125 day gestational age postnatal 24 month . The sample size comparison arm double analysing secondary indicator . Study set The study conduct Habiganj district , Sylhet division report high stunt prevalence Bangladesh . The investigator select 12 Unions ( population ~300,000 ) randomly two adjacent sub-districts . Each Union would divide cluster , cluster comprise ~450 household ~2000 population . In select 125 study cluster , 10 20 pregnant woman intervention comparison cluster would enrol , respectively , enrolment would close accordingly . Considering estimate live birth per year 21/1000 population , expect number 24 month old child cluster study completion would 7 , adjust 4.5 % mortality postnatal two year 30 % drop-out . Thus , 25 cluster per study arm would yield 175 350 child per intervention comparison arm , respectively , reach second birthday , require number sample trial . Treatment assignment The investigator randomly select 5 cluster multiple 5 cluster per union , 125 cluster total , computer assist programme . In union , select cluster evenly allocate 5 study arm , specified random allocation sequence generate computer assist programme . Recruitment participant Pregnant woman study area would list door-to-door surveillance conduct fortnightly . From , within 125 gestational age would voluntarily enrol study upon confirmation pregnancy strip test . Post-enrolment study procedure : After enrolment , two team would active : 1 ) The intervention team intervention arm ( arm 1 , 2 , 3 4 ) ; 2 ) The assessment team 5 arm . Both team would supervise monitor two layer field supervisor . 1 . The intervention team Interventions implement trained team Community Health Workers ( CHWs ) , supervise Field Supervisors ( FSs ) , locally recruit . After staff recruitment , CHWs FSs would train master trainer nutrition-specific BCC , rigorous field practice , formally commence deliver intervention . 2 . The assessment team An independent team data collector ( DCs ) recruit locally trained central team data collection . The enrolment DC team collect baseline follow data . Project Management Information System ( MIS ) A comprehensive automate project MIS develop web link tablet-PC-based pregnancy enrolment , data collection intervention delivery format . The android-based customised platform direct CHWs enrolment DCs intervention data collection visit schedule , respectively , also contain BCC module questionnaire require . Data collection All data collection tool adopt standard validate structured questionnaire , especially BDHS . Key indicator report tool use show table 2 . 1 . Baseline characteristic : Demographic , Socio-economic , reproductive information household food security participant woman collect structured questionnaire enrolment trial . 2 . Nutritional intake pregnant lactating woman : Nutritional intake ( energy protein ) mother assess open 24-hour recall form enrolment , 6th 9th month pregnancy 3rd , 12th , 18th month lactation period . 3 . Nutritional status pregnant lactate woman : Anthropometric measurement collect assess initial nutritional status subsequent weight gain pregnancy . Weight , height MUAC pregnant woman measure enrolment , weight MUAC measure 6th 8th month pregnancy , postnatal follow-up visit . Weight measure use electronic weigh scale Tanita precision 10 gm . Surgical medical product ( NSW , Australia ) height measure scale use measure height pregnant woman . MUAC would measure standardised MUAC tape adult . 4 . Nutritional intake child : Nutritional intake feed practice infant measure 7th day birth , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month age . WHO-recommended IYCF indicator would address , i.e . early initiation breastfeeding , pre-lacteal feeding , exclusive breastfeeding , breastfeed complementary feeding practice 6 , 12 , 18 24 month age child . 24-hour 7-day dietary recall would assess information . 5 . Anthropometric measurement child : Birth weight collect within 24 hour live birth , measure use electronic weigh scale preferably SECA ( Hamburg , Germany ) precision 10g . Length newborn measure use locally make collapsible length board 1mm precision . These measurement continue 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month birth . 6 . Supplement compliance : The compliance form structure questionnaire respondent ' attitude practice towards ante-natal complementary food supplement provide . All measurement equipment would calibrate use .</detailed_description>
