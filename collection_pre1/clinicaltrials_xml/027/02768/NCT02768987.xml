	<brief_title>Bright 1 Bodies Weight Management Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prevalence overweight among patient type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) age grown alarm rate since 1980s . Physical inactivity occur among 65 % 95 % youth T1D double risk overweight . A major factor limit physical activity appear self-managed problem solve around exercise adjustment insulin diet , practice regularly less half adolescent patient T1D less frequently self-management behavior . Our previous intervention apply cop skill train ( ABCs Diabetes TeenCope ) well diabetes self-management ( Managing Diabetes ) successfully improve problem-solving aspect self-management along health outcome among adolescent T1D , focus overweight promotion physical activity weight loss . The Yale Bright Bodies intensive lifestyle program successfully promote physical activity weight loss , enrol &gt; 100 overweight youth great New Haven annually presently accommodate T1D . The purpose present study pilot test 12-week intensive lifestyle program adolescent overweight T1D utilize group exercise class Bright Bodies adapt population , supplement cop skill train diabetes self-management education address problem solve behavior limit physical activity weight control . Our primary aim evaluate change physical activity adherence , anthropometrics ( body mass index percentile age , body fat percentage ) , self-management behavior follow 12-week lifestyle program among sedentary adolescent T1D overweight ( n=25 , OW ) compare sedentary adolescent T1D normal weight ( n=25 , NW ) . We hypothesize OW group achieve improve physical activity adherence anthropometrics great extent NW group previous Bright Bodies cohorts , change correlate improve exercise-related problem solve . Although physical activity recommend weight loss , outcome increase physical activity heterogeneously distributedâ€”not overweight participant lose weight even gain weight . Furthermore etiologies overweight/obesity T1D appear interact , yet study test influence physical activity upon biological pathway relate overweight/obesity patient T1D . Accordingly , secondary aim evaluate change adipocytokines epigenetic factor related etiology overweight/obesity follow physical activity intervention . We hypothesize change biomarkers correlate change anthropometry variable partially explain difference response group individual occur .</detailed_description>
