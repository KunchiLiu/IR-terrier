	<brief_title>Study Of Single-dose Cyclophosphamide +Pembrolizumab In Patients With Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , single-arm , multicenter study evaluate pembrolizumab therapy 200 mg IV give every 3 week ( Q3W ) , follow single prim dose cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 IV patient advance triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) receive least one prior line therapy . The primary objective estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) cyclophosphamide + pembrolizumab advance TNBC patient compare pembrolizumab alone ( historical PFS = 1.9 month ) .</detailed_description>
