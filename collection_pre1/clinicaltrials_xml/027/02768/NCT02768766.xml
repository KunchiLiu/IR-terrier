	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good and/or bad , intermittent dose drug Selumetinib subject uveal melanoma . Selumetinib drug block ( turn ) methyl ethyl ketone ( MEK ) , protein activate uveal melanoma cell . Selumetinib MEK inhibitor . Blocking MEK may stop cancer grow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intermittent Selumetinib Uveal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uveal melanoma ( UM ) common primary intraocular malignancy adult , arise melanocyte within choroid plexus eye . The development metastasis common occur approximately 50 % patient posterior UM within 15 year initial diagnosis treatment . As effective systemic therapy yet identify disease , outcomes metastatic UM poor median survival 12 month . There FDA approve therapy patient advance UM . Studies show inhibition MAPK pathway MEK inhibitor selumetinib ( hyd-sulfate AZD6244 ) effective therapy uveal melanoma despite treatment , cure achieve . Although drug selumetinib studied patient take treatment every day , research show case , may better use treatment intermittent schedule . Such strategy may reduce side effect , allow high dos drug use , completely block MAPK pathway , prevent development drug resistance mechanism within tumor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histopathologically confirm diagnosis metastatic unresectable uveal melanoma . Note Documentation mutation status uveal melanoma require prospectively give high rate GNAQ/11 mutation ( &gt; 90 % ) population Able provide inform consent prior initiation study Age ≥ 18 year old Measurable indicator lesion RECIST v1.1 Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) ≥20 mm conventional technique ≥10 mm spiral CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . See Section 13.3 information regard evaluation measurable disease . Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60 % Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) ≤2 Ability take oral medication All clinically significant toxicity prior therapy must ≤ grade 1 ( exception alopecia ) Organ marrow function laboratory value follow : Adequate marrow function absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1500 cells/mm3 platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3 hemoglobin &gt; 9.0g/dL Adequate hepatic function Angiotensin Sensitivity Test/alternative ( AST/ALT ) &lt; 2.5x upper limit normal document liver disease &lt; 5x upper limit normal document liver disease Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5X upper limit normal unless know diagnosis Gilbert 's disease Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5x upper limit normal document liver disease &lt; 6x upper limit normal document liver bone disease Creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . Negative pregnancy test ( serum urine ) woman child bear potential The effect selumetinib develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation 4 week study discontinuation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 3 month completion selumetinib administration . Patients chemotherapy immunotherapy within 4 week radiation therapy within 2 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients receive investigational agent concurrently . Palliative radiation therapy allow long patient meet eligibility criterion . Have recent major surgery within minimum 4 week prior start study treatment , exception surgical placement vascular access . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition selumetinib Every effort must make avoid use concomitant medication prolong correct QT ( QTc ) interval receive selumetinib ( hydsulfate AZD6244 ) . If patient discontinue medication prolong QTc interval receive selumetinib , close cardiac monitoring perform . Patients QTc interval &gt; 450 msec factor increase risk QTc prolongation arrhythmic event ( ex . Heart failure , hypokalemia , family history long QT syndrome ) include heart failure meet New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class III IV definition ( see Appendix A ) exclude . Prior current cardiomyopathy include limited following : know hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , know arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy , previous moderate severe impairment leave ventricular systolic function ( LVEF &lt; 45 % echocardiography equivalent MuGA ) even full recovery occur .

Pregnant woman exclude study selumetinib may teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother selumetinib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated selumetinib .
