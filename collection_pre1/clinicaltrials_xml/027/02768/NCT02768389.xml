	<detailed_description>Primary Objective - Determine compliance treatment 6 12 week . Compliance assess review daily food diary urine serum ketone level . Diet compliance define follow diet guideline 80 % time resultant ketosis 80 % time . If 60 % patient compliant diet , define , consider positive result . Secondary Objective ( ) - Determine patient compliance monitoring blood glucose urine level ketosis . - Determine obstacle compliance . - Determine frequency achieve ketosis , measure urine ketone check daily serum BHB check every two week . - Determine quality life ( FACT-BR ) adverse event . - Determine response , progression free survival 6 month ( PFS 6 ) , overall survival ( OS ) . Exploratory Objective - To correlate level ketosis blood sugar treatment outcome . - To correlate level MCT4 expression IDH1 mutation status treatment outcome .</detailed_description>
