	<brief_summary>This study investigate new diagnostic technology order expand current understanding inflammatory neoplastic cutaneous disease process eczema , psoriasis , granuloma annulare , cutaneous lymphoma , squamous cell carcinoma , basal cell carcinoma melanoma . Protein fragment find sweat collect use diagnostic skin patch analyze mass spectrometry . The goal study identify specific protein fragment biomarkers may current understand cutaneous disease . The protein expression pattern derive sweat compare conventional histopathologic , immunohistochemical , flow cytometry , in-situ hybridization , polymerase chain reaction , mass spectrometry analyse cutaneous biopsy specimen . The insight gain research use promote advance disease prevention early diagnosis , identify prognostic indicator new therapeutic target .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator propose novel technology use bedside field : FDA approve diagnostic skin patch harvest , concentrate , stabilize panel protein fragment derive skin transudate sweat . While drug delivery patch routinely use , technology propose exactly opposite function : harvesting diagnostic marker use novel affinity bait nanoparticles , bound within adhesive skin patch . The propose technology may overcome major physiological barrier prevent use biologic fluid diagnostic testing . Sweat disease protein fragment subject rapid degradation due protease present sweat normal skin bacterial flora , exist extremely low abundance , far detection sensitivity standard analysis platform . Harvesting hydrogel nanoparticles engineer chemical high affinity bait sequester low abundance target analytes , protect degradation indefinitely . Once applied skin , nanoparticles patch harvest minute minute , protect degradation , candidate analytes sweat underneath patch . The core shell bait nanoparticles completely novel technology amplify sensitivity protein fragment detection 100 fold . No technology exist similar yield , concentration ability , stabilization function . Once collection complete , patch mail diagnostic lab room temperature . Upon receipt , nanoparticle-captured analytes interest elute patch routine measurement use platform . Feasibility study demonstrate virtually 100 percent capture 100 percent elution yield low abundance interleukin model sweat solution . The investigator collect sweat healthy volunteer Institutional Review Board approval . Mass spectrometry use discover novel sweat protein fragment concentrate preserved patch . Low abundance labile protein fragment harvest nanoparticles measure clinical immunoassay verify sensitivity precision . Data gather study use develop foundation sweat protein fragment test cutaneous disease .</detailed_description>
