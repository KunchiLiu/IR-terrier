	<detailed_description>Objective : The purpose study assess effect dexmedetomidine anesthesia glymphatic flow human subject visualize diffusion tensor MRI . Study Design : This study take place University Pennsylvania . Investigators plan enroll approximately 30 healthy volunteer generate pilot data large grant submission . Characteristics Study Population : Subjects healthy male female age 20 40 year age recruit participate MRI scan design measure clinically establish , safe image diffusion tensor image cerebral blood flow baseline , continuous intravenous infusion dexmedetomidine dos design produce anesthesia-induced unconsciousness simulate natural sleep , return wakefulness . They must able pass standard MRI safety assessment ( e.g. , metallic metal clip implant contraindication undergo MRI ) . Design : Upon successful completion screen questionnaire , urine drug , urine pregnancy subject schedule MRI . On day study subject receive intravenous catheter ( IV ) study drug fluid . Set one MRI scan do dexmedetomidine . Set two scan do subject anesthetized dexmedetomidine goal depth sedation moderate sedation . Set three scan do dexmedetomidine stop wakefulness achieve .</detailed_description>
