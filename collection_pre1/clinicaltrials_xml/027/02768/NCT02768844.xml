	<brief_title>Physiology Therapeutic Management Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Novel approach diagnose treat Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome ( NAS ) need reduce prolonged pharmacological management , minimize hospitalization improve developmental outcome drug expose newborns . This study seek examine physiology symptom drug withdrawal ( e.g. , irritability mark movement activity ; cardio-respiratory instability ) infant expose drug utero test whether sensory stimulus ( tactile , auditory ) reduce dysregulated system withdraw infant . Candidates at-risk NAS due fetal drug exposure identify investigator infant 's Attending physician . Investigators use modified-consecutive sampling technique , restrict equipment personnel availability , enrol infant . Participants study throughout hospitalization . Effects stimulation examine different stage withdrawal . Efficacy stimulation examine potential complementary treatment NAS .</detailed_description>
