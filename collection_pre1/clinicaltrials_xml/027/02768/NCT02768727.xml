	<brief_summary>The dual objective study determine phenomenon neural inertia present human determine whether order neurocognitive function invariant among anesthetic agent . This study enroll 12 healthy volunteer , age 20-40 year , receive xenon gas ( concentration range 0 % 75 % ) deliver via inhale route ENHANCER 3000 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Test Neural Inertia Humans With Xenon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multimodal , nonrandomized study healthy subject . After meet enrollment criterion , subject receive baseline neurocognitive test computer 15 minute receive wrist watch actigraphy device record rest/activity pattern 8-14 day . On study day ( roughly two week later ) , repeat baseline neurocognitive testing perform subject fit high density EEG head cap . The actual intervention ( delivery inhale xenon gas stepwise increase follow decrease dos ) occur 4 hour along verbal test assess presence/absence consciousness xenon concentration . Xenon dos choose specifically evaluate point individual lose regain consciousness . Doses escalate used human anesthesiology ( 75 % ) permit surgery . After exposure , serial neurocognitive test occur every 30 minute 3 hour post emergence . Subjects discharge study 's intervention day home upon reach standard post-anesthesia care unit criterion ( modify Aldrete score â‰¥9 ) . A post-procedure follow phone call occur within 24 hour anesthetic exposure ensure subject remains well . The individual 's involvement complete upon return Actigraphy watch 1 week exposure day . The expected duration subject participation 3 week .</detailed_description>
