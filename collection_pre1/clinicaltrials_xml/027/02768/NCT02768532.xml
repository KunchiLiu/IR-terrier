	<detailed_description>Vedolizumab ( VDZ ) monoclonal antibody bind heterodimer alpha 4 beta 7 integrin show efficacy Crohn 's disease induce maintain clinical response/remission . The French marketing authorization obtain Crohn 's disease patient failure anti-TNF ( Tumor Necrosis Factor ) agent . For Crohn 's disease patient treat vedolizumab , strong association vedolizumab serum level clinical response induction maintenance demonstrate anterior study . It could paramount interest early identify Crohn 's Disease patient vedolizumab responder vedolizumab induction identify achieve clinical remission maintenance therapy vedolizumab . Researchers decide assess clinical response vedolizumab induction week 10 , Gemini III trial report , among patient experience previous TNF ( Tumor Necrosis Factor ) antagonist failure . 15 % give vedolizumab remission week 6 ( P=0.433 ) versus 12 % placebo . At week 10 , 26 % vedolizumab remission versus 12 % placebo arm . Moreover , week 10 , proportion patient present clinical response significantly high Crohn 's Disease patient treat vedolizumab ( 46 % vs 24 % ) . In study , clinically non-responders week 10 , additional dose 300 mg vedolizumab infuse week 10 every four week . In post hoc analysis GEMINI 2 , additional dose vedolizumab patient clinically non responder vedolizumab obtain clinical remission 33 % case .</detailed_description>
