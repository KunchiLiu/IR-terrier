	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : About 25 % stroke case lead aphasia . Aphasia include difficulty speech production comprehension , well read write impairment .

Speech language therapy main form aphasia rehabilitation . The updated Cochrane review indicate intensive speech language therapy effective therapy low intensity . Current aphasia service Norway seem accordance national guideline treatment rehabilitation stroke . The capacity aphasia rehabilitation community level small lack speech language therapist .

The literature within field however sparse also substantial lack study show effectiveness telerehabilitation . Financed Norwegian Foundation Health Rehabilitation , investigator earlier perform pilot project Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital cooperation Norwegian Centre Integrated Care Telemedicine . This pilot study show language training telemedicine feasible regard technical , practical rehabilitation aspect . The pilot study lay ground large control study . OBJECTIVE : The project aim contribute scientific evidence field aphasia telerehabilitation . The study seek answer question whether aphasia rehabilitation deliver telemedicine improve language function post stroke aphasia . The investigator also want investigate effect patient 's quality life form therapy experience patient therapist . DESIGN : The study conduct randomize controlled clinical trial ( RCT ) intervention control group . The post intervention test follow blind perform speech language therapist unknown patient 's allocation . PARTICIPANTS : Patients recruit stroke unit Oslo University Hospital Ullevål , Akershus University Hospital , Østfold Hospital , Lovisenberg Hospital Diakonhjemmet Hospital . A power analysis perform main effect measure . Based power analysis , 32 participant include group . Considering drop , one plan include 40 participant group , total number 80 subject . The investigator include patient recently acquire stroke aphasia include naming impairment . Patients age 16 year patient unable perform 5 hour speech language therapy per week due medical cognitive reason , exclude INTERVENTION : The intervention group receive speech language therapy via telemedicine , control group receive specific therapy part study . Both group receive standard aphasia rehabilitation . The amount standard aphasia rehabilitation log participant . Participants intervention group receive daily language train 1 hour 5 day 4 week . The telemedicine language training perform via internet Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital laptop participant home . As already test pilot study , investigator use technical solution `` Cisco Jabber Video '' remote control software `` LogMeIn '' , telerehabilitation give . PROCEDURES : The stroke unit refer patient , fulfill inclusion criterion , Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital language training . Shortly discharge stroke unit , ambulatory visit Sunnaas perform informed consent request , - case patient willing participate study - assessment carry . The pretesting stroke unit mainly conduct PhD-candidate and/or Speech language therapist project . The testing perform randomization procedure take place . After randomization , participant receive laptop training use computer telerehabilitation purpose give . The post-intervention testing follow-up-testing , blind perform speech language therapist unknown allocation participant . Directly intervention period ( 4 week ) , participant visit home come outpatient clinic Sunnaas hospital . The laptop retrieve assessment perform . The control group test corresponding time point . A follow-up assessment perform 3 month later participant . OUTCOME MEASURES : To investigate effect aphasia rehabilitation deliver telemedicine , investigator choose look especially naming measure expressive language function . The investigator want regard prolonged effect aphasia telerehabilitation language function . Further investigator want see effect immediately intervention language function name . The investigator also want investigate whether language training telemedicine affect quality life , person aphasia therapist experience use telerehabilitation early stroke . For assessment language functioning , Norwegian Basic Aphasia Assessment ( NGA ) subtests conversational interview , naming , repetition comprehension used.The test carry continued entire select subtest , test perform without interruption result many mistake , originally intend Norwegian Basic Aphasia Assessment manual . To assess ability sentence production , investigator use Verb Sentence Test ( VAST ) subtest nr 7 . Functional communication assess use Communicative Effectiveness Index ( CETI ) . Quality life assess use Stroke Aphasia Quality Life scale ( SAQOL-39 ) . In addition , experience patient , relative therapist telerehabilitation service assess use questionnaire well semi-structured interview select patient . There interview therapist perform telerehabilitation . Primary endpoint : Naming ability 3 month complete intervention . Secondary endpoint : - Language function name ( repetition , comprehension , sentence production ) 3 month complete intervention - Functional communication quality life 3 month complete intervention . - Naming language function immediately intervention . ANALYSES AND STATISTICS : The investigator use linear regression intention to-treat ( ITT ) analysis .</detailed_description>
