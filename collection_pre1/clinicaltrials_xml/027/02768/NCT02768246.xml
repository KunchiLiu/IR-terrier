	<brief_title>Comparison Bag-Valve-Guedel Adaptor Common Face Mask Ventilation Bearded Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ventilating patient use bag valve face mask easy perform , especially long period time , mandate experience strength care giver . The need tight seal around mouth nose major challenge especially patient beard . Nevertheless , face mask approve respiratory support medic basic care giver allow use out-of-the-hospital setting , physician paramedic allow use advanced technique , provide definite airway . Thus , despite low effectiveness , bag valve mask technique commonly use field The purpose study evaluate efficacy novel bag valve guedel adaptor ( BVGA ) enable direct connection bag valve device guedel - eliminate need face mask . Study Design : Prospective , randomize , control . The volunteer ask randomly assign breathe BVGA/Face mask follow protocol Face-mask/BVGA : 5 minute room air , 5 minute 100 % oxygen , 5 minute room air . The BVGAs/face mask well connect standard operating room ventilation machine , cardiopulmonary parameter monitor document .</detailed_description>
