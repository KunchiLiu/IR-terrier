	<detailed_description>Brain metastasis occur 20-40 % patient cancer , incidence 10 time higher primary malignant brain tumour . patient brain metastasis underserved population . Overall poor prognosis median survival 1-2 month corticosteroid 5-7 month whole brain radiotherapy . An important factor poor prognosis patient brain metastasis inability many drug penetrate blood-brain-barrier tumour tissue.Combination therapy surgical excision , radiotherapy novel drug could potentially improve prognosis patient . CamBMT1 open label , 3 Arm randomise Phase 2 trial investigate whether administration low dose target radiotherapy afatinib treatment could increase concentration drug penetration brain metastasis . Eligible patient Phase 2 randomise 1 3 Arms : Arm 1 : radiotherapy Arm 2 : 2Gy radiotherapy Arm 3 : 4Gy radiotherapy All patient also receive 11 day afatinib treatment recommend Phase 2 dose , previously determine Phase 1b safety run-in phase . On Day 10 , afatinib treatment patient randomise Arms 2 3 receive allocate dose radiotherapy On Day 12 , patient undergo neurosurgical resection brain metastasis/ses . Patients follow Day 22-28 Day 41 +/- 7 day For primary outcome measure , sample measurement plasma concentration afatiinib take pre-treatment , day 10 Day 12 post-resection . Tumour tissue resect brain metastasis take day 12 measurement afatinib concentration . The primary outcome measure ratio concentration . The patient population study breast/likely breast lung/likely lung primary cancer operable brain metastasis .</detailed_description>
