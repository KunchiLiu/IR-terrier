	<brief_summary>Rationale : The purpose research study test effectiveness standard high dose cytarabine ( HiDAC ) day 1 5 follow single dose pembrolizumab day 14 induction therapy patient relapse refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . Patients achieve response treatment continue study drug ( pembrolizumab ) every 3 week 1 year maintenance therapy . Purpose : This study new investigative drug , pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) study clinical research trial together standard chemotherapy ( HiDAC ) relapse refractory AML . The study also explore association potential immune biomarkers clinical outcome pembrolizumab ; therefore patient blood bone marrow sample collect treatment determine dynamic nature immune signatures pre post-treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Dose Cytarabine Followed Pembrolizumab Relapsed/Refractory AML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective 1 . Estimate objective overall rate CR ( CR+CRi ) age-adjusted HiDAC ( age &lt; 60 year : 2 gm/m2 IV Q12hours day 1-5 ; age &gt; 60 year : 1.5 gm/m2 IV Q12hours day 1-5 ) follow pembrolizumab 200 mg IV day 14 relapse refractory AML patient Secondary Objectives 1 . Estimate rate unacceptable toxicity associate HiDAC follow pembrolizumab induction therapy 2 . Estimate objective overall response rate ( PR+CR+CRi ) HiDAC follow pembrolizumab . 3 . Characterize toxicity associate HiDAC follow pembrolizumab induction therapy 4 . Characterize toxicity associate pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3weeks use monotherapy maintenance initial response induction phase HiDAC follow pembrolizumab 5 . Estimate relapse-free survival ( RFS ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient receive maintenance pembrolizumab 6 . Estimate overall survival ( OS ) patient receive induction phase treatment .</detailed_description>
