	<brief_title>Neural Adaptation After Tendon Transfer Training Tetraplegia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Restoring upper limb function rat among high priority individual tetraplegia . Re-establishing active grasp pinch strength hand accomplish tendon transfer procedures tendon strong proximal muscle surgically re-attached tendon paralyzed muscle . A common procedure restore lateral ( key ) pinch transfer distal tendon one three elbow flexor muscle , brachioradialis ( Br ) tendon paralyzed thumb flexor , flexor pollicis longus ( FPL ) . Recovery functional pinch depend well patient learns activate Br flex thumb new distal attachment , also control flexion elbow proximal attachment . The investigator ' previous work show Br FPL recipient activate transfer Br fully may reach optimal functional status traditional therapy . The investigator propose participation postoperative task-based training program drive cortical change impact functional ( pinch ) ability . Recent study individual cervical SCI show substantial cortical reorganization occur injury , neural substrate motor learn tendon transfer study . For patient , little known functional brain change accompany improved performance response additional intervention . The Br FPL transfer alters central feedback periphery may permit new adaptive neural pathway achieve great functional use tendon transfer . Neuroimaging technique , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) become important tool understanding plasticity neuromuscular system assess neural underpinnings successful novel intervention . The objective propose study identify neural pattern associate best functional outcome ( high pinch force ) Br FPL transfer . The investigator use fMRI functional performance measure find neural predictor correlate muscle re-education . That , investigator expect successful postoperative muscle re-education depend increase cortical drive transfer Br combination new synergist , reflect neural imaging result . The purpose study evaluate neural activity Br FPL transfer recipient conventional therapy response additional task-based training home program aim improve voluntary activation transfer Br functional pinch task . The 10-week training program evaluation RRD Pilot ( B0583P ) study include produce pinch force different upper limb posture , biofeedback pinch dynamometer , practice select pinch task . The investigator anticipate increase amplitude distribution fMRI blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) responses sensorimotor cortex underlie improved motor control post-surgically follow successful intervention promote motor relearning . Specific Aims 1 . Define cortical representation pre-training pinch function SCI patient . The investigator quantify pattern ( location , volume intensity ) cortical activation associate voluntary pinch individual one-year post Br FPL tendon transfer surgery conventional therapy program . The investigator hypothesize ( H1 ) great volume intensity brain activation correlate well pinch function measure pinch strength magnitude Br activation pinch . Secondary analysis determine location brain activation varies pinch function ( force ) specificity relative voluntary elbow flexion . 2 . Evaluate cortical response task-based home therapy program . Correlates task-based adaptation pre- post-training assess use fMRI . H2 : Greater activation ( intensity volume ) primary motor cortex ( M1 ) sensory cortex translate increase voluntary activation transfer Br pinch compare elbow flexion . Task-based training outcome measure include isometric pinch force magnitude , EMG quantification Br activation pinch elbow flexion . 3 . Determine neural signature surgical training induced motor improvement . H3 : After direct task-based training , brain activity voluntary pinch extend adjacent area ( large representation , great activity ) , sensorimotor brain area , facilitate ability voluntarily increase transfer Br activation pinch . Secondary analysis contrast size activation level brain change pinch activation patient receive train relative non-impaired non-surgical participant . The postoperative therapy protocol tendon transfer procedure well define , inconsistently apply , lack evidence effectiveness . The study propose investigate cortical change ass outcome dependent plasticity . Thus , may possible predict individual re-train transfer muscle well others . Establishing relationship lead understand mechanism successful intervention may identify brain base dynamic could become focus future treatment ( e.g . biofeedback , brain stimulation , etc . ) .</detailed_description>
