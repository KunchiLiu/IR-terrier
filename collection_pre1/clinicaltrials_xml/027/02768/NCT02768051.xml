	<brief_summary>Demonstrate safety , feasibility usability EPD D700 system , first time human , subject undergoing ablation treatment atrial flutter . Prospective , single-center , non-randomized , open label , single arm study . Ten consent subject schedule undergo ablation due atrial flutter . All subject undergo baseline assessment ; intervention ( standard fluoroscopy guide RF ablation procedure ) post procedure follow . All subject follow visit within 24 hour post procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety , Feasibility Usability EPD D700 System Atrial Flutter Ablation Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All procedure perform standard fluoroscopic guidance treatment atrial flutter ablation procedure , D700 system use additionally demonstrate system safety , feasibility usability . The entire procedure conduct customary , use standard approve off- the-shelf equipment ( body surface electrode , diagnostic irrigate ablation catheter , RF generator record system ) , completely clinically independent manner D700 system merely 'silent witness ' . The operator neither use rely D700 system output clinical decision making .</detailed_description>
