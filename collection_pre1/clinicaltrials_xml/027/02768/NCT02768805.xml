	<detailed_description>This randomize , observer-blind , multicenter , Phase 2 study conduct multiple site across United States Canada . The influenza strain composition Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine use study include 2 influenza A virus strain ( A/California/7/2009 [ H1N1 ] A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 [ H3N2 ] ) 2 influenza B virus strain ( B/Phuket/3073/2013 [ Yamagata lineage ] B/Brisbane/60/2008 [ Victoria lineage ] ) , base 2015-2016 recommended World Health Organization ( WHO ) strain vaccination Northern hemisphere . Approximately 900 healthy subject randomize 1:1:1 ratio 1 3 parallel treatment group . Subjects group stratify 2 age stratum : 18 49 year 50 64 year 2:1 ratio . Subjects receive one intramuscular ( IM ) injection assign vaccine : - 15 µg/strain Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine , - 30 µg/strain Quadrivalent VLP Vaccine , - 15 µg/strain license commercially available quadrivalent vaccine FluLaval® Tetra . Subjects participate study approximately 8 month , 5 visit schedule , phone contact make Day 1 , Day 8 , every 2 month thereafter 6 month post-Day 21 visit ( Day 201 ) . Safety laboratory assessment perform Screening , Day 3 within 48 hour Day 3 result availability , grade 3 grade 4 abnormality deem necessary investigator early termination .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects must able read , understand , sign inform consent form ( ICF ) ; complete studyrelated procedure ; communicate study staff visit phone . 2 . Subjects consider Investigator reliable likely cooperate assessment procedure available duration study . 3 . Male female subject must 18 64 year age , inclusive , Screening ( Visit 1 ) . 4 . Subjects body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 18.0 ≤ 32.4 kg/m2 Day 0 . 5 . Subjects must good general health prior study participation ( 30 day prior study vaccine administration ) clinically relevant abnormality could jeopardize subject safety interfere study assessment assess Principal Investigator subInvestigator ( thereafter refer Investigator ) determine medical history , physical examination , biochemistry , hematology , urinalysis . Note : Subjects preexist chronic disease allow participate disease stable , accord Investigator 's judgment , condition unlikely confound result study pose additional risk subject participate study . Stable disease generally define new onset exacerbation preexist chronic disease 6 month prior immunization . Based Investigator 's judgment , subject recent stabilization disease could also eligible . 6 . Female subject must negative serum pregnancy test result Screening ( Visit 1 ) negative urine pregnancy test Randomization prior immunization . 7 . Female subject childbearing potential must use effective method contraception 1 month prior immunization agrees continue employ adequate birth control measure least 60 day postimmunization . Moreover , must plan become pregnant least 2 month postimmunization . Abstinent subject ask method ( ) would use , circumstance change , subject without welldefined plan exclude . The following relationship method contraception consider effective : Hormonal contraceptive ( e.g. , injectable , topical [ patch ] , estrogenic vaginal ring ) ; Intrauterine device without hormonal release ; Male partner use condom plus spermicide sterilized partner ( least 1 year prior immunization ) ; Credible selfreported history heterosexual abstinence least 60 day postimmunization ; Female partner . 8 . Nonchildbearing female define : Surgicallysterile ( define bilateral tubal ligation , hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy perform 1 month prior immunization ) ; Postmenopausal ( absence menses 24 consecutive month age consistent natural cessation ovulation ) . Subjects meet follow criterion exclude participate study : 1 . According Investigator 's opinion , history significant acute chronic , uncontrolled medical neuropsychiatric illness . `` Uncontrolled '' define : Requiring new medical surgical treatment within one month prior study vaccine administration ; Requiring change medication dosage one month prior study vaccine administration due uncontrolled symptom drug toxicity , chronic disease , significant change medication dosage within 6 month prior study vaccine administration base upon investigator 's judgment ( elective dosage adjustment stable subject acceptable ) . 2 . Any medical neuropsychiatric condition history excessive alcohol use drug abuse , Investigator 's opinion , would render subject unable provide inform consent unable provide valid safety observation report . 3 . Any autoimmune disease hypothyroidism stable replacement therapy confirm suspected immunosuppressive condition immunodeficiency include know suspected human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , Hepatitis B C infection , presence lymphoproliferative disease . 4 . Administration plan administration noninfluenza vaccine within 30 day prior randomization blood sample Day 21 . Immunization emergency basis evaluate casebycase Investigator . 5 . Administration adjuvanted investigational influenza vaccine within 1 year prior randomization plan administration prior completion Day 201 . 6 .

Use investigational nonregistered product within 30 day 5 halflives , whichever longer , prior randomization plan use study period . Subjects may participate investigational market drug study participate study Day 201 visit . 8 . Treatment systemic glucocorticoid dose exceed 10 mg prednisone per day , equivalent 7 consecutive day 10 day total , within one month study vaccine administration , cytotoxic immunosuppressant drug , immunoglobulin preparation within 3 month vaccination completion Day 21 visit . Low dos nasal inhaled glucocorticoid allow . Topical steroid permit . 9 . Any significant disorder coagulation include treatment warfarin derivative heparin . Persons receive prophylactic antiplatelet medication ( e.g. , lowdose aspirin [ 325 mg/day ] ) , without clinically apparent bleeding tendency eligible . Subjects treat new generation drug increase risk intramuscular bleeding ( e.g. , clopidogrel ) also eligible . 10 . History allergy constituent Quadrivalent VLP vaccine ( include H1N1 , H3N2 , B/Bris , B/Phuket ) , component license quadrivalent vaccine , tobacco allergy . 11 . History anaphylactic allergic reaction food , medication , bee sting . 12 . Any history serious asthma ( e.g. , status asthmaticus , hospitalization asthma control ) recurrent asthma episodes require medical attention last 3 year ( ≥ 1 episode/year ) 13 . Continuous use antihistamine last 4 week prior immunization use antihistamines 48 hour prior study immunization . 14 . Use prophylactic medication ( e.g . acetaminophen/paracetamol , aspirin , naproxen , ibuprofen ) within 24 hour randomization prevent preempt symptom due vaccination . Subject discover take prophylactic medication within 24 hour prior plan randomization must delay least 24 hour period meet . 15 . Have rash , dermatological condition , tattoo , muscle mass , abnormality injection site may interfere injection site reaction rating . 16 .
