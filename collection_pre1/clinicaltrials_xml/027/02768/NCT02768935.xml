	<brief_summary>The prevalence type 2 diabetes grow steadily . Patients diabetes , cardiovascular complication ( myocardial infarction ( MI ) ) frequent severe non-diabetic subject . The anti-diabetic therapy available little effect incidence cardiovascular event . It therefore urgent diabetic develop new therapeutic strategy reduce occurrence MI limit consequence . In two week follow MI , monocytes / macrophage represent ischemic heart tissue cell . The infiltration monocytes / macrophage infarction MI two-phase process . In first phase , monocytes / macrophage M1 promote digestion injure area , monocyte / macrophage M2 intervene promote angiogenesis , collagen deposition contribute tissue repair . The optimal repair myocardial infarction depend effective recruitment monocyte macrophage M1 transition need digest damage tissue M2 macrophages necessary tissue repair . The balance two phenotype M1 M2 control different modulators , transcription factor , cellular miRNA miRNA extracellular contain microvesicles ( MVs ) . Interestingly , plasma MVs circulate essentially derive monocyte platelet contain miRNA impaired inflammation various pathological situation ( IDM ) . Furthermore , metabolic disorder hypercholesterolemia ( often associate diabetes ) affect transition M1 M2 response response delay cardiac repair . To date , mechanism control M1 / M2 transition heart level elucidate . Moreover , impact diabetes , lead chronic low-grade inflammation , explore . Targeting immune response promote transition M1 / M2 MI could innovative therapeutic approach . However , good characterization response M1 M2 macrophages MI mechanism contribute tissue remodel effect diabetes need . The goal study phenotype / macrophage function MI change diabetes determine potential role miRNAs contain secrete MVs transition M1 / M2 MI . Monocytes / macrophage subject normal blood sugar diabetes underwent IDM ( 10 per group ) characterize phenotypically . Their ability produce MVs analyze . These MVs test functionally ability orient polarization healthy recipient monocyte . The content MVs term miRNAs analyze detail . By bioinformatics analysis , miRNAs interest ( base abundance target gene ) select . These miRNAs over-expressed macrophage MVs produce cell analyzed ability modulate differentiation monocytes recipient . Finally , circulate level miRNAs interest measure 1 year IDM correlate clinical phenotype patient ( recurrence , arrhythmia , heart failure ) . Ultimately , goal identify VMs promote differentiation monocytes alternative phenotype identify miRNAs responsible effect . This could help future , subject impaired ability monocyte differentiate alternatively , change introduce miRNA interest re-inject inject MVs macrophage contain miRNA interest thus correct defect differentiation .</brief_summary>
