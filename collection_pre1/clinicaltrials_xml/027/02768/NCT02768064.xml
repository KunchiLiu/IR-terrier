	<brief_summary>During Transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) procedure , new valve implant . The valve CoreValve ( Medtronic Company ) Edward SAPIENS ( Edwards Company ) . All TAVI patient require temporary pacemaker ( PMK ) , usually perform insertion standard temporary electrode femoral vein . The temporary PMK associate small significant rate complication . The PMK usually remove immediately end TAVI procedure , use Edward SAPIENS valve . The CoreValve valve associate conduction complication , thus PMK later remove case . PMK Complications see include : - Right Ventricle perforation temporary electrode , lead Pericardial bleeding , case Tamponade - Infection - Electrode dislocation cause In-effective pacing ( and/or sense ) - Prolonged bed rest - Prolonged hospitalization - Access relate problem ( hematoma , pneumothorax ) In review large cohort ( 1 ) patient Milan ( JACC 2012 ) rate tamponade 4.3 % associate temporary PMK .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temporary Pacemaker Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator experience infrequent occurrence temporary electrode associate tamponade , either acutely Transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) completion , delay , association electrode removal . The tamponade rate patient temporary pacemaker ( PMK ) 14/150 ( 9.3 % ) . Not tamponade case relate temporary PMK , 2 occur set catastrophic annular rupture one first case relate Left Ventricle stiff wire . The investigator also note significant prolongation bed rest hospital stay patient temporary PMK . Using flexible permanent pace electrode actively fix Right Ventricle place jugular vein reduce pacing-related complication rate ( due flexibility electrode ) , time ambulation ( due fixation electrode ) , hospital stay also unnecessary PMK . Cost also reduce due prevention complication reduction Intensive Cardiac Care Unit time . Procedure time might slightly prolong since placement standard electrode timely , however prolongation negligible , benefit flexible permanent pacing electrode worth prolongation</detailed_description>
