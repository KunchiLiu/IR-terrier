	<brief_title>PIEB v PCEA With Epidural CSE Technique . A Randomized Double Blind Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women labor receive epidural analgesia may experience breakthrough pain ( BP ) require use additional medication source dissatisfaction analgesic treatment labor . The investigator define two type BP : 'primary breakthrough pain ' first moment patient request analgesia labor . 'Secondary breakthrough pain ' defined time previously effective epidural analgesia turn ineffective . The BP may multiple cause , delivery progression catheter misplacement . There single pattern provide adequate neuraxial analgesia labor , certain patient specific clinical situation method provide advantage others . The choice suitable system epidural drug delivery important role get proper analgesia low incidence breakthrough pain labor . In order develop preventive strategy BP , clinical scale estimate incidence rate describe . Among risk factor BP investigator include : Nulliparity , epidural catheter placement earlier cervical dilation , neonatal weight technique perform ( epidural versus combine spinal-epidural - CSE ) . In addition , technological development offer u new treatment modality pain management childbirth evolve recently improve maternal satisfaction , well treat prevent BP : Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia ( PCEA ) add continuous epidural infusion ( CEI ) , computer integrate PCEA ( CI-PCEA ) automatic program intermittent epidural bolus ( PIEB ) . Nowadays , evidence best epidural analgesic treatment optimum epidural punction order reduce BP episode , hence , increase maternal satisfaction . Therefore , investigator design randomize double blind clinical trial know incidence breaktrough pain ( BP ) high-risk BP parturients ( nulliparous early cervical dilation ) compare two epidural analgesic regime add contiuous infusion L-bupivacaine plus fentanyl : program intermittent epidural bolus versus patient control epidural analgesia . The role epidural technique ( epidural versus combine spinal-epidural ) incidence BP also evaluate .</detailed_description>
