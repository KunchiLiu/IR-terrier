	<detailed_description>A Prospective Multi-center Randomized Trial Assessing Efficacy Safety Active Transfer Plaque v . Provisional T Stenting Treatment Non-Left-Main Coronary Bifurcation Lesions . The purpose trial evaluate efficacy safety Active Transfer Plaque provisional T stenting technique treat non-left-main coronary bifurcation lesion base TLR rate 12-months post-procedure . Provisional T Stenting common technique BL treatment . Active Transfer Plaque ATP report , comparison two procedure . In ATP treatment bifurcation lesion , two wire advance distal main vessel ( MV ) side branch ( SB ) . Stent balloon advance MV SB respectively . The MV stent release dilate SB balloon . By predilating balloon target SB , plaque actively transfer SB MV . Subsequently , plaque fix expansive stent MV.As provisional T treatment , provisional T stenting typic step-T stenting . In brief , two wire advance distal MV SB . Predilation leave operator 's discretion , however , predilating SB encourage . Kissing balloon inflation stenting MV leave operator 's discretion . A stent stent/artery ratio 1.1:1 inflated MV . Rewire SB also leave operator 's discretion . FKBI recommend least one following : residual stenosis &gt; 75 % , &gt; type B dissection TIMI flow &lt; 3 . All patient follow clinically 1- , 6- 12- 24-month stent implantation . Repeat angiographic follow-up recommend patient 12 month index procedure . The primary endpoint trial rate TLR 12-month follow-up .</detailed_description>
