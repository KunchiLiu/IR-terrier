	<brief_summary>Prior study perform understand optimal way minimize morbidity rate buccal mucosa . While study report primary closure inferior heal secondary intention , appear true large defect great 2 cm width . For small defect wind close without tension , recent study show improved pain outcome immediate post-operative setting , although difference see long term whether wound primarily close . However , large defect , standard practice allow delay heal secondary intention . The use Alloderm graft placement donor site coverage first describe Armenakas ' group . Alloderm acellular dermal lattice human allograft skin . The study report use Alloderm fail find significant improvement patient outcome ; however , small defect include study control group underwent primary closure , show inferior large defect . Importantly , increase post-operative pain note , although increase swelling report . From experience , patient moderate large ( &gt; 2 cm width ) defect follow buccal mucosa harvest benefit Alloderm placement decrease post-operative pain , rapid resumption normal diet mouth function associate increase morbidity procedure . This study aim determine whether reliable improvement technique . This study clarify cheek heals buccal mucosa remove reconstructive surgery . Subjects randomize either receive tissue collagen matrix stitch surgery . Subjects evaluate six month determine outcome tissue matrix graft well subject .</brief_summary>
