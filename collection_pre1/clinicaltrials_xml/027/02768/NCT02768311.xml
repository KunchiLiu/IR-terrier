	<brief_title>Comparative Evaluation Post Endodontic Pain Following Root Canal Treatment With Two Rotary System : Neolix &amp; Waveone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many study pain root canal treatment experience take consideration . Pain endodontic treatment still one major problem patient . The prevalence widely study 6/10 % 9.82 % report . One important strategy endodontic treatment , prevention control pain treatment . This multi-factorial disorder result complex process occurs , affect patient 's intrinsic factor , tooth dentist 's skill . Mechanical factor include channel instrumentation technique , instrumentation fill material extrusion channel associate presence pain treatment consider . Apical extrusion infect debris instrumentation channel create exacerbate inflammatory process . Channel shape apical debris extrusion process increase even preparation limit channel . Leaving debris method preparation , either manually stainless steel file rotary technique nickel titanium file happen . The use rotary technique among dentist increase . develop NITI file rotary instrumentation system , reduce apical extrusion debris , expect reduce incidence inflammation pain treatment , achieve mean . Recent study show reciprocal shaping technique , compare full-rotation technique , significantly increase amount debris extrude apical region root cause increase pain treatment . Two rotary system available market : 1 ) Neolix ( france Neolix SAS ) recently introduce file NITI , single file , full rotation movement , square rectangular cross-section , non-uniform shape along blade , tip size , 25 Tipper 0 / 08 , system , Wave one , ( DENTSPLY Maillefer ) , file NITI , Single file Single use , reciprocation movement , cross-Convex triangular Modified three size : small , primary ( tip size 25 Tipper 0/08 ) , large contain , accord size canal , one select . In study Ana Arias et al. , Patients experimental group Rotary Files root treat patient control group treat step-back technique , result show patient control group , experience pain root canal therapy . While duration pain control group comparison experimental group , less report . In study Aqrabawi , teeth vital pulp divide two group . Root canal therapy first group , do manual file , second group , Protaper rotary file perform . And significant difference pain root canal treatment detect . Gambarini show study , patient treat waveone system do , significantly pain treatment compare TF TF adaptive experience . Today , dentist tend use rotary system . Despite increase diversity system well study prevalence pain root canal treatment rotary system , And particular , compare amount pain treatment , system RECIPROCAL AND FULL ROTATION single-file , aim study evaluate effect apply canal preparation system , Neolix WaveOne , prevalence pain endodontic treatment .</detailed_description>
