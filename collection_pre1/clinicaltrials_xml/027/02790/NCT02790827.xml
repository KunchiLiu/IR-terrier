	<brief_title>Trial Multi-pronged Intervention Address Prevention Violence Zambia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims : 1 . To test effectiveness multi-pronged intervention reduce prevent violence woman child compare treatment usual control group among family live Lusaka , Zambia . 2 . To test effectiveness multi-pronged intervention compare treatment usual control group reduce identify risk factor violence include alcohol use , mental health problem , poor parent skill , family communication behavior pattern . Design Overview : This randomize controlled trial evaluate effectiveness multipronged intervention reduce violence woman girls/youth ( VAWG ) address number identify risk factor ( e.g. , childhood abuse , domestic violence , alcohol use ) . 168 family compound ( i.e . community ) city Lusaka randomize either control experimental condition . An adult male , adult female , one child family `` unit '' participate study . Child participation optional ( i.e. , adult male female family unit may participate n't child provide permission child participate ) . The experimental intervention , cognitive behavioral therapy-based psychotherapy ( CETA ) focus alcohol abuse gender-specific violence , address mental health , abuse , parent skill , family communication behavior pattern . There may conjoint session include caregiver ( ) child ( ren ) , possible . During 4-5 month intervention period three group session per week : one male group , one group woman , one group child . Each counsel group approximately six group member . The intervention design way due research support multi-modal treatment , model organization likely incorporate program prevent violence regular service ( i.e. , group-based vs. individual session ) . The primary outcome study severity violence woman child . Secondary outcome include alcohol use aggression , mental behavioral health gender norm . The control condition define 'treatment usual ' . In Zambia , formal service standard care alcohol use problem domestic violence . There , however , organization ( non-governmental organization ) operate Lusaka provide intermittent service type problem . Some family receive informal counseling parish priest leader community . In study investigator therefore define type informal service 'treatment-as-usual . ' Investigators closely track type , number , degree kind service participant receive access . Following conclusion study , investigator offer CETA intervention control family find safe effective . Participants : Participants family unit consist three individual : adult woman , husband partner , one identify child adult couple chooses include child study ( child may male female , age 8-17 , describe adult female child affect violence ) . The family recruit urban community ( compound ) Lusaka violence alcohol abuse know problem . A family include study adult female indicate brief screener moderate amount violence within family measure score 38 Severity Violence Against Women Scale ( SVAWS ) . The male family must also indicate drink alcohol hazardous level and/or female must indicate male drink alcohol hazardous level evidence score 8 high Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ( AUDIT ) . The man woman must agree participate study order family eligible . The participation child optional . The parent may decide participate provide permission parent ' child participate . The child may also choose participate him/herself . In either case , parent may still include study without child . Recruitment : Study participant recruit urban community several method . The primary method recruitment outreach CETA counselor . The CETA counselor recruit trained Johns Hopkins University ( JHU ) Serenity Harm Reduction Programme Zambia ( SHARPZ ) conduct intervention deep tie within community knowledge family may benefit intervention . The CETA facilitator go door-to-door approach family community s/he think benefit intervention . This current standard procedure similar program run SHARPZ Lusaka community . The counselor ask family time family could meet privately discuss study CETA service . The meeting take place time place convenient family . Investigators provide CETA facilitator recruitment script give overview study CETA intervention family . Investigators also include three recruitment strategy necessary . One additional strategy church-based community leader outreach effort compound . In Lusaka , community leader compound often associate local church . Investigators hold community meeting investigator describe study purpose general term community member . Investigators advertise designate time place ( typically local parish ) interested family come speak research staff participate study receive full information participation . Investigators also ask Home Based Care Workers ( HBCWs ) work church discuss study family already provide care . Investigators ask HBCWs use recruitment script CETA counselor . Families interested hearing study speak HBCW able meet research staff designate place/time full study information , consent , screen procedure . Recruitment church HBCWs effective previous study investigator conduct Zambia find acceptable community Lusaka . A second additional strategy snowball sample method . Investigators may ask participant enrol study refer family , neighbor , community member may affect violence alcohol abuse u . Investigators provide current participant information next designated place time study assessment pass information others community . Investigators also provide contact information case potential participant want contact u directly . Investigators find previous study Zambia participant often come u ask participant may refer friend neighbor study participation . A third strategy may include referral on-going community support group compound . Members group often information family community may problem violence and/or alcohol . Investigators provide information group next day/time assessment conduct area ask pas information family . In strategy , potential study participant contact research study staff participant express someone ( i.e. , CETA counselor , HBCW , friend/neighbor already enrol ) interest hearing study would like research staff contact . If family eligible study , member assign unique study identification ( ID ) number . These ID number use start ACASI ( laptop-based ) assessment participant . Participants complete assessment separately privately use ACASI laptops headphone . No identify information ( names , address , phone number ) capture ACASI . Following complete assessment , three ID number bring SHARPZ main office study assessor , ID number securely store Study Director . The Study Director forward eligible ID number day JHU-based research staff randomly allocate family ( cluster 3 ID number ) either intervention control condition . The family notify study team within one day follow baseline assessment randomization assignment . If participant assign control group , investigator explain procedure call weekly check next several month ( active intervention phase ) monthly thereafter next two year study on-going . If participant randomize intervention , Investigators let participant know investigator contact within week weekly thereafter detail start group counsel session ( group expect begin within approximately 3 week follow assessment ) . Assessments violence , alcohol use , secondary outcome conduct four timepoints use ACASI : 1 . Baseline 2 . 4-5 month post-baseline ( immediately follow intervention period ) 3 . 12 month post-baseline 4 . 24 month post-baseline ( primary timepoint interest ) Descriptions self-report outcome measure describe . In addition self-report measure capture ACASI , investigator collect hair-sample participant four time point test cortisol , well-established biomarker chronic stress . The primary timepoint interest 24 month assessment . The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) conduct analysis 12 month assessment ass effectiveness CETA reduce violence . If statistically clinically significant effect , trial stop investigator offer intervention control participant . Investigators would assess outcomes 24 month assessment among intervention participant monitor whether treatment effect sustain . Sample size calculation base SVAWS measure . Calculations base recent study conduct South Africa woman abuse partner alcohol use problem . The study find mean SVAWS physical violence sub-scale score 58.6 ( SD=20.5 ) time reference past three month . Investigators believe 20 % reduction mean SVAWS physical violence subscale score would programmatically significant ( i.e . worth find ) . The sample size need obtain 11.66 point reduction among intervention participant 12 month , assume change among control participant , 80 % power alpha 0.05 , 100 family ( 50 per arm ) . To account potential drop-out/loss follow-up potentially small cluster effect provider/group level , investigator aim recruit 84 family trial arm , total 168 family enrol study . All analyse intent treat . For continuous outcome ( e.g. , SVAWS score ) investigator estimate linear mixed effect model incorporate random intercept term account within subject correlation repeat measure . Generalized linear model use categorical outcome . The outcome score follow-up time model separately use treatment arm , baseline symptom score ( meaningful difference study arm baseline ) , time , interaction treatment arm time fix covariates model . Protocol update October 2016 : Following first week intervention delivery , investigator find significant number participant , group therapy session impractical due logistical challenge . Therefore , investigator modify delivery CETA participant individually deliver therapy session instead group therapy session . Participants able attend group session prefer method still receive intervention group delivery method . The sample size increase order statistical power conduct sub-group analysis study participant receive individual ( group ) CETA test whether individual delivery mode effective compare treatment usual control group . An additional 80 family ( 40 randomize arm ) recruit study purpose . The total sample size therefore plan 248 family .</detailed_description>
