	<brief_summary>The purpose study gather information patient heart failure eligible one follow two procedure : 1 ) mechanical support , i.e . ventricular assist device ( VAD ) 2 ) heart transplant . study seek determine patient population benefit heart transplant ventricular assist device . This allow offer state-of-the-art care patient heart failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Registry Cardiogenic Shock : Utility Efficacy Device Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiogenic shock ( CS ) develop end stage various etiology heart failure continue hold high mortality ; range 50 80 % . Expert consensus recommend use powerful mechanical circulatory support device ( MCSD ) patient population ; however , scientific evidence anecdotal rely mostly single-center small case series , fundamentally , unified definition grade severity highly heterogeneous condition CS . Well-designed study warrant precisely characterize various `` phenotype '' CS well role MCSD condition still excessive mortality . This multicenter registry first multicenter large-scale registry focus mechanical circulatory support ( MCS ) therapy CS . The fundamental goal RESCUE advance understand application MCSD order improve persistently dismal survival patient CS follow intent : 1 . Elucidate current indication outcome MCSD use CS . 2 . Redefine CS good description disease entity , allow good prediction outcome , selection treatment strategy , comparison design study . 3 . Facilitate refinement patient selection maximize outcome current new device option . 4 . Improve expedite new device clinical trial provide historical control data . 5 . Develop consensus `` best practice '' guideline improve clinical management reduce short long-term complication MCSD therapy .</detailed_description>
