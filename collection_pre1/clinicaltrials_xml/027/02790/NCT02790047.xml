	<brief_title>Effect Home-base Exercise With Conical-PEP Device Physical Performance Quality Life COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The key pathophysiology COPD expiratory flow limit hyperinflation major factor relate exertional dyspnea exercise limitation . When expiratory minute volume ( V ̇E ) raise exercise , respiratory response increase respiratory rate ( RR ) tidal volume ( VT ) , force exhalation occur lead develop premature airway closer . These generate dynamic air tap breath breath result dynamic hyperinflation ( DH ) . The DH limit VT expansion , increase respiratory muscle load , major cause relate dyspnea exercise termination . Furthermore , Pre-inflammatory product COPD lung contribute another system , provoke systemic inflammation lead nutritional abnormality , weight loss , skeletal muscle dysfunction , osteo-skeletal effect , cardiovascular effect psychological effect . All affect exercise tolerance gradually affect physical activity health-related quality life ( HRQL ) well . COPD GOLD guideline state goal treatment stable COPD comprise relive symptom , improve exercise tolerance , improve health status , prevent disease progression reduce mortality . Several evidence suggest effect pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) patient stable COPD follow acute exacerbation . Strong evidence report PR program could improve exercise tolerance , reduce dyspnea , decrease fatigue improve health-related quality life . The core stone PR exercise program . Several type exercise publish endurance exercise , interval exercise , strengthen exercise , respiratory muscle strengthen breathe exercise . Most COPD patient stop exercise cause dyspnea related DH development exercise . Previous study report various strategy reduce DH development exercise extend exercise time increase exercise capacity immediate effect bronchodilator , hyperoxic breathing , heliox breathing , positive pressure therapy non-invasive positive pressure ventilation ( NIPPV ) , purse lip breathing ( PLB ) positive expiratory pressure ( PEP ) device . The PEP therapy conventionally use reduce premature airway closer move equal pressure point distal proximal , improve gas exchange improve secretion clearance . In past decade , knowledge dynamic hyperinflation COPD patient rapidly glow . The PEP device PLB use reduce DH development exercise report 5 study . They expect delay DH development , may delay exertional dyspnea , may result improve exercise capacity . Three study report DH parameter pre post exercise . Results indicate use PEP device reduce DH measure immediate post exercise . However , effect positive pressure therapy ( PEP device PLB ) exercise capacity also inconclusive . But three study show positive effect PEP therapy exercise capacity . Training effect PEP therapy physical performance quality life present two study . The first study show benefit breathe retrain ( include PLB , breathe technique ) integrate daily activity exercise program , superior control group peak oxygen consumption 7th week exercise program . The second study apply PLB reduce DH exercise program . They find ten session ( within 3 4 week ) program , PLB control group significantly improve 6 minute walk distance quality life , non-significant effect group . To date two study PEP therapy apply exercise program , result conclusive . In spite PLB wildly use , positive pressure technique report 5 cm H2O , low boundary therapeutic pressure range ( 5 20 cm H2O ) , may result non-success DH reduction . Consequently , The PEP device may convenient alternative way generate positive pressure within therapeutic range reduces DH exercise daily activity live . This may increase patient 's physical performance quality life great exercise alone .</detailed_description>
