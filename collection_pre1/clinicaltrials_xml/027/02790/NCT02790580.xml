	<brief_summary>Background : The investigator previously study addition low-dose , short-course sunitinib pre-operative chemotherapy neoadjuvant set newly diagnose breast cancer patient measurable primary breast tumor phase Ib/II study National University Cancer Institute , Singapore . These data show addition sunitinib improve tumor vascularization hypothesize enhanced short-term treatment response . However , pathological complete response rate 4 cycle chemotherapy superior standard chemotherapy , may attribute dose delay increase myelosuppression addition sunitinib . The investigator hypothesize promise regimen may optimize use growth factor support . The investigator thus plan study addition low-dose , shortcourse sunitinib dose-dense doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide ( ddAC ) administer every 14 day , support pegfilgrastim . Aim : To confirm addition 12.5mg sunitinib 5-7 day add cycle ddAC ( deliver every 14 day , support pegfilgrastim ) without compromise dose intensity , phase II open label single arm part study , follow phase II randomize study compare pathological complete response rate ddAC versus sunitinib + ddAC stage I-III HER2 negative breast cancer patient neoadjuvant set . Methods : A single-centre study comprise two phase : . Phase II open label single-arm study enroll newly diagnose stage I-IV HER2 negative breast cancer patient receive either neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( stage I-III patient ) first-line palliative chemotherapy ( stage IV patient ) . All patient treat 4 cycle ddAC standard dos ( 60/600mg/m2 ) every 2 week , support subcutaneous pegfilgrastim 6mg , administer 24-36 hour dose chemotherapy . Low dose sunitinib 12.5mg daily orally administer 7 day prior cycle 1 ddAC , 5 day prior subsequent cycle ddAC . b . Phase II randomize study enroll newly diagnose stage I-III HER2 negative breast cancer patient receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy definitive breast cancer surgery . Eligible patient randomize 1:1 4 cycle ddAC without intermittent sunitinib patient measurable primary breast cancer receive preoperative chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Breast cancer major cause morbidity mortality locally well globally . Approximately 10-15 % newly diagnose breast cancer patient present metastatic disease ; addition , significant proportion patient initially present non-metastatic disease relapse distant metastasis . These patient prospect cure , systemic therapy remain mainstay treatment . In last year , several target agent approve treatment breast cancer . For example , addition bevacizumab , anti-angiogenic agent , chemotherapy show improve treatment outcome metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer possibly neoadjuvant treatment triple negative breast cancer . Two class anti-angiogenic agent currently available : monoclonal antibody vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , bevacizumab ; small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor target intracellular tyrosine kinase domain vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGF-R ) , sunitinib sorafenib . Small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib sorafenib currently evaluate clinical trial . Although sunitinib sorafenib potent anti-angiogenic agent , clinical data report thus far combined chemotherapy , less promising predict pre-clinical study . One possible reason optimal schedule small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor chemotherapy yet determine . Preclinical observation suggest anti-angiogenic agent 'normalize ' tumor vasculature . Further continuous administration anti-angiogenic agent ultimately result destruction tumor vasculature , starve tumor result tumor necrosis . When combined chemotherapy , continuous scheduling may paradoxically result reduced delivery chemotherapy tumor , cause relatively chemo-resistant state may account less optimal result combination study , largely employed strategy continuous dose small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Intermittent dose small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor prior chemotherapy transiently 'normalize ' tumor vasculature , may make efficient drug oxygen delivery , thus potentiate sensitivity chemotherapy . The investigator previously study addition low-dose , short-course sunitinib pre-operative chemotherapy neoadjuvant set newly diagnose breast cancer patient measurable primary breast tumor phase Ib/II study National University Cancer Institute , Singapore . The study data show addition sunitinib improve tumor vascularization hypothesize enhanced short-term treatment response . However , pathological complete response rate 4 cycle chemotherapy superior standard chemotherapy , may attribute dose delay increase myelosuppression addition sunitinib . The investigator hypothesize promise regimen may optimize use growth factor support . The investigator thus plan study addition low-dose , short-course sunitinib dose-dense doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide administer every 14 day , support pegfilgrastim .</detailed_description>
