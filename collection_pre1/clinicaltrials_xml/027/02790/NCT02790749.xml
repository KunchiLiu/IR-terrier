	<brief_title>Periacetabular Osteotomy With Versus Without Adjunctive Hip Arthroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Developmental dysplasia hip increasingly well-recognized problem adolescent , young adult , middle-age adult . Surgical correction periacetabular osteotomy ( PAO ) give good result moderate-term follow-up , accord recent study . Increasingly recognize also presence intra-articular source hip pain patient , cartilage disease labral pathology . These manifest certain clinical radiologic finding pre-operatively . However , role operative management problem , specifically role arthroscopy , remain unclear . Historically , intra-articular pathology patient dysplasia manage open incision joint capsule ( arthrotomy ) toward end PAO procedure . However , recent evidence suggest open arthrotomy may miss detection subtle intra-articular pathology arthroscopy immediately prior PAO , anesthetic , may safe highly effective management strategy . The exact clinical implication subtle finding yet clear . In prospective randomize comparative effectiveness study , investigator aim compare clinical surgical outcome measure include rate reoperation patient report outcomes measure ( PROMs ) non-arthritic hip score ( NAHS ) , Hip Outcome Score ( HOS ) , modify Harris Hip Score ( mHHS ) , iHOT-12 score , two group patient ( N=22 per parallel arm ) undergo PAO dysplasia : randomize arthroscopy PAO versus randomize PAO alone . The investigator aim elucidate degree clinical benefit improve detection management intra-articular pathology afford arthroscopy versus PAO arthrotomy alone follow-up minimum one year . Rates reoperation PROMs assess one year post-operatively conclusion study two year enrollment first patient . PROMs also assess 3 6 month post-operatively allow repeated-measures analysis measure improvement pre-operative value .</detailed_description>
