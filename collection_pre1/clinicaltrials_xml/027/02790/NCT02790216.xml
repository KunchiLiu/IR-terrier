	<brief_summary>Objective : To focus high dose radiation gross tumor prostate maintain adequate dose control microscopic disease elsewhere prostate . In order test incorporation robust MRI TRUS fusion algorithm clinical setting investigator plan study Focused therapy primary endpoint accurate localization high risk region . This pilot study dose painted permanent I-125 seed implant verify absence tumor cell outside high risk region use multi-parametric MRI deformable TRUS registration . The high risk region dose paint 160 Gy rest prostate receive normal prescription dose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary end-point : Feasibility dose paint determine absence tumor outside high-risk region intra-operative trans-perineal biopsy . Frozen section obtain , however receipt final pathology 2-4 week procedure 2 possible scenario arise : 1 . There evidence cancer : confirms accuracy TRUS MRI registration . 2 . There evidence tumor stereotactic biopsy : In case regular dosimetric check ( perform Standard care procedure know post-operative dosimetry ) perform determine whether adequate dose deliver . If , involve needle position record treatment plan label co-ordinate , regular possibility accurately add radioactive seed possible .</detailed_description>
