	<brief_summary>Pain main obstacle delay postoperative recovery lead prolonged hospital stay . Administration intrathecal morphine spinal anaesthesia provide effective pain control . However , associate significant side effect include nausea , vomit itchiness . Also , suitable patient , example , morphine allergy , severe respiratory disease . Surgical rectus sheath block involve injection local anaesthetic agent rectus sheath space closure wound . It show provide adequate pain control less systemic side effect . The aim study evaluate effectiveness surgical rectus sheath block intrathecal morphine post-Caesarean section pain control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The incidence Caesarean section increase worldwide . Adequate post-operative analgesia become essential expectation patient Caesarean section . The process recovery hinder suboptimal pain control eventually lead immobilization prolong hospital stay . Spinal anesthesia usually mode anesthesia pregnancy view increase general anesthetic risk . Intrathecal morphine provide good pain control . However , pruritus occur 51 % patient , nausea vomit 21 % . Despite significant side effect , overall well patient satisfactory use intrathecal morphine . Due concern respiratory depression , intrathecal morphine recommend patient severe respiratory disease , obstructive sleep apnoea receive central nervous system depressant . As result , numerous study alleviate adverse effect search alternative . Rectus sheath block aim block terminal branch 9th -12th intercostal nerve within rectus sheath . They form rectus sheath plexus pierce posterior aspect rectus sheath branch muscular cutaneous branch . It give anesthetist without ultrasound guidance . However , involve additional time administration rectus sheath block possibility incorrect placement catheter lead ineffective analgesia . On contrary , surgical rectus sheath block administrate surgeon closure rectus sheath . It involve injection local anesthetic rectus sheath space closure wound direct visual control . Surgical rectus sheath block show effective postoperative pain control transverse laparotomy paediatrics patient . It show effective postoperative pain control Caesarean section without intrathecal morphine . Surgical rectus sheath block may simple safe alternative intrathecal morphine . However , evidence use Obstetrics Gynaecology sparse study directly compare two different mode analgesia . The aim study evaluate use surgical rectus sheath intrathecal morphine postoperative pain Caesarean section ; side effect profile .</detailed_description>
