	<brief_title>Transcutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation Patients With Overactive Bladder ( OAB ) Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In single centre pilot study , 48 patient OAB ( 24 neurogenic 24 idiopathic OAB ) randomize use self-applicating ambulatory skin-adhering device transcutaneously stimulate tibial nerve 30 minute , either daily weekly , 12-weeks . Changes low urinary tract ( LUT ) OAB symptom QoL measure baseline , week 4 , 8 , 12 use standardize validated scoring instrument ( ICIQ-OAB ICIQ-LUTSqol ) Global Response Assessment ( GRA ) week 12 . Weekly phone call usage diary capture patient-reported experience device compliance . The primary study outcome assess safety acceptability device . In addition , treatment response assess use Global Response Assessment ( GRA ) week-12 , International Consultation Incontinence Questionnaire Overactive Bladder LUTS-quality life ( ICIQ-OAB ICIQ-LUTSqol ) baseline , week 4 , 8 12 . In GRA patient ask assess response treatment use ordinal scale 0 3 , refer none , mild , moderate mark improvement , respectively 1 . Patients report moderate mark improvement consider respond treatment 1 . The ICIQ-OAB score 4-item questionnaire ass OAB symptom severity bother whereas ICIQ-LUTSqol score 20-item health relate quality life questionnaire . In questionnaire , part A assess symptom severity part B reflect accumulative bother patient . High score suggest bad symptom profile negative impact QoL , respectively . Patients record use device customize compliance diary also include entry experience use device adverse effect . Additionally , weekly phone call make member research team ass compliance . Statistical analysis A feasibility sample size 48 patient adopt formal power calculation perform convention pilot study . All data present mean SDs . Paired student t-tests use provide estimate within group response baseline 12 week .</detailed_description>
