	<brief_summary>The whole body calorimeter sensitive enough reliably measure cold-induced thermogenesis surrogate marker brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) activation . The infrared ( IR ) energy flux activate BAT accurately image quantified use IR image device , IR energy output may correlate increase energy expenditure quantify whole body calorimeter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The recent rediscovery functional brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) healthy adult open excite possibility manipulate BAT obesity management , imperative develop BAT image modality non-invasive safe repeat use . Given heat specific end-product uncoupling protein-1 ( UCP-1 ) -mediated BAT , study examines whether surface body temperature assess use infrared ( IR ) thermography non-invasive measure accurately precisely predict brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) activation upon cold stimulation , involve verify semi-automated method characterize thermal image . In addition , study also aim validate use whole-body calorimeter pick change energy expenditure upon cold-induced thermogenesis . Lean , healthy male volunteer recruit . Thermal image cervical-supraclavicular BAT do use IR camera ass change BAT activation . Blood sample also draw regular interval track change serum metabolite upon BAT activation . All , study hope provide support evidence IR thermography viable image modality non-invasive , safe reproducible study BAT activity .</detailed_description>
