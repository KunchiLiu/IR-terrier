	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness study drug IdeS patient wait list kidney transplant previously undergone desensitization unsuccessfully effective desensitization highly unlikely . At study entry , patient available deceased live donor positive crossmatch test . The study ass IdeS efficacy safety remove Donor Specific Antibodies ( DSAs ) thereby convert positive crossmatch test negative .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Evaluate Efficacy IdeS Desensitize Transplant Patients With Positive Crossmatch Test</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study ass IdeS efficacy create negative crossmatch test ( CXM ) patient exhibit donor specific antibody ( DSA ) positive crossmatch test available live decease donor . The first 3 patient study receive kidney decease donor . The study primarily examine efficacy IdeS create negative CXM . The first 3 patient receive one dose 0.25 mg/kg BW IdeS study day 0 . If consider safe negative crossmatch test achieve first dose , additional IdeS infusion give within 2 day first infusion . The dose schedule may increase 0.5 mg/kg BW give twice first 3 patient test . The decision escalate dose do evaluation safety efficacy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients kidney transplant waitlist previously undergone desensitization unsuccessfully effective desensitization highly unlikely . The breadth strength sensitization predict extremely low likelihood successful desensitization kidney pair donation . Patients live decease donor positive crossmatch test . Previous treatment IdeS Previous high dose IVIg treatment ( 2 g/kg BW ) within 28 day prior IdeS treatment Lactating pregnant female Women childbearing age willing able practice FDAapproved form contraception HIVpositive patient Patients test positive HBV infection [ positive HBVsAg , HBVcAb , HBVeAg/DNA ] HCV infection [ positive AntiHCV ( EIA ) confirmatory HCV RIBA ] Patients active tuberculosis A significantly abnormal general serum screen lab result accord investigator 's judgement . Hgb &lt; 6.0 g/dL Severe condition require treatment close monitoring , e.g . cardiac failure &gt; NYHA ( New York Heart Association ) grade 3 , unstable coronary disease oxygen dependent COPD Individuals deem unable comply protocol Patients active CMV EBV infection define CMVspecific serology ( IgG IgM ) confirm quantitative PCR without compatible illness Patients history clinically significant thrombotic episode , patient active peripheral vascular disease Patients receive investigational drug within 4 halflives ( similar ) Known allergy/sensitivity IdeS infusion Patients live donor test positive ImmunoCap antiIdeS IgE</criteria>
