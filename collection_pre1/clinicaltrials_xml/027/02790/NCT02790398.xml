	<detailed_description>ED highly prevalent mental disorder one main cause disability worldwide . Currently , evidence show efficacy transdiagnostic treatment anxiety disorder , comorbid depression anxiety disorder . An important line research within transdiagnostic treatment ED initiate D. H. Barlow . Barlow 's theory triple vulnerability emphasize underlying vulnerability common ED help explain comorbidity among diverse condition . A central aspect within theoretical perspective role emotion regulation ED . The regulation negative emotion ED receive great deal attention cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) research , recently transdiagnostic ED model like UP develop Barlow 's team . However , although Barlow underscore role low PA onset maintenance ED , main objective treatment component UP train patient negative affect ( NA ) regulation , less attention pay inclusion treatment component directly target PA regulation . Moreover , literature show high level PA associate well physical psychological health , healthy lifestyle , good general functioning . Consequently , important treatment goal transdiagnostic treatment approach would increase PA decrease NA . The aim study compare differential effect two transdiagnostic treatment protocol ED use randomize pilot study design : ) transdiagnostic treatment protocol ( TTP ) base Unified Protocol ; b ) version protocol also include specific component address regulation positive affect ( TTP+PA ) . Another aim ass acceptability treatment patient . It hypothesize intervention would result significant difference favor TTP+PA protocol measure . Regarding acceptability , hypothesize treatment ( TP TP+PA ) would well-accepted two group participant .</detailed_description>
