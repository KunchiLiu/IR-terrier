	<brief_title>Development Feasibility Testing Lung Cancer Screening Decision Aid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose project develop innovative web-based decision aid ( DA ) improve decision make lung cancer screening ( LCS ) among individual high risk lung cancer due cigarette smoking . Recent National Lung Screening Trial ( NLST ) data demonstrate 20 % relative reduction lung cancer mortality low dose compute tomography screen compare chest X-ray among individual high lung cancer risk . Given lung cancer lead cause cancer death United States estimate 160,340 death predict 2012 , new data reinvigorate interest LCS . However , LCS carry substantial risk include high false positive rate , over-diagnosis , adverse psychosocial consequence , increase radiation exposure . Further , unknown whether LCS would reduce lung cancer mortality among individual smoke meet NLST eligibility criterion . Therefore , currently clear best choice whether give individual screen . Decisions participate LCS well inform consistent individual preference . However , previous data indicate individual undergo LCS rarely thorough understand risk benefit . To address rapidly emerge public health challenge , research develop web-based decision aid ( DA ) facilitate inform decision make regard LCS individual high risk lung cancer ( i.e. , cigarette smoker ) , assess feasibility DA administration propose method conduct future randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) DA effectiveness . The content DA base investigator previous study explore LCS decision make recent research . The specific aim currently propose research conduct feasibility trial DA among individual high risk lung cancer due heavy cigarette smoking . Investigators recruit participant assess feasibility : 1 ) deliver DA intervention community setting , 2 ) conduct research procedure assessment tool plan future RCT .</detailed_description>
