	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Investigating Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) Enhance Mindfulness Meditation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many people initially attempt meditation get mind still . Or get quick result find frustrating . Thus , number people benefit meditation would increase method make easy perform . Moreover , establish actual brain mechanism involve benefit meditation would potentially open synergistic treatment approach . The investigator investigate use new , non-invasive brain stimulation method call transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) augment state mindfulness . tDCS safe , inexpensive , non-invasive brain stimulation modality capability focally increase decrease cortical activity . Anodal stimulation produce positive DC stimulation associate increased cortical activity , whereas Cathodal stimulation produce negative DC stimulation associate decreased cortical activity . Cortical activity change occur stimulation dose response fashion ( high current density long duration stimulation produce large longer lasting effect ) . The investigator investigate use tDCS augment mindfulness meditation double-blind , crossover , randomize , sham-controlled trial .</detailed_description>
