	<detailed_description>Gout chronic progressive form arthritis occur result monosodium urate deposition joint surround tissue . Despite extremely well know pathogenesis availability highly efficacious therapy , gout continue lead considerable morbidity mortality due poor management limit therapeutic adherence . The investigator translational research study address deficit evidence implementation . The treatment chronic gout base primarily use urate low therapy ( ULT ) reduce frequency , eventually eliminate , acute flare addition reduce risk progressive joint destruction . There currently four ULT agent approve treatment gout United States ( US ) include probenecid ( uricosuric ) , pegloticase ( biologic therapy approve treatment-refractory gout ) , allopurinol , febuxostat . Available 40 year , allopurinol remain frequently prescribe ULT , account ~99 % ULT prescription . Many early study confirm robust urate lower effect allopurinol , treatment also yield ample improvement long-term outcome include reduction gouty flare . A recent 28-week randomize trial examine fix dose daily allopurinol reveal 34 % reduction serum urate concentration vs. decrease 3-4 % receive placebo . There factor contribute sub-optimal allopurinol administration likely include , limited : 1 ) failure prescribers appropriately titrate allopurinol dose achieve optimal serum urate target level ; 2 ) poor long term patient adherence therapy ; 3 ) drug intolerance , recognize affect small proportion patient ; 4 ) limit data regard effectiveness dos exceed 300 mg/day ; 5 ) concern regard increase toxicity higher dos , particularly context chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . To date , publish study examine impact large scale intervention implement optimize allopurinol administration gout . Intervention study do universally involve small sample size limit single center , substantially limit external validity effort . The impact intervention , largely employ prescription audit performance feedback provider , either go unreported quite modest effect . Given potential cost-effectiveness allopurinol gout treatment compare alternative ULTs grow number report consistently characterize everyday use sub-optimal , intervention focus improve optimize allopurinol administration context 'real-life ' gout care urgently need .</detailed_description>
