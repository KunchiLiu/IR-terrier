	<brief_summary>Aortic valve disease cause impaired let ventricular function ( LVF ) due hypertrophy , dilatation diffuse myocardial fibrosis yet prognostic effect fibrosis , wait time operation postoperative exercise training presently unknown . The investigator aim ( 1 ) determine change LVF patient wait list ; ( 2 ) establish non-invasive diagnostics diffuse myocardial fibrosis ; ( 3 ) relate LVF fibrosis physical capacity . The unique design ( echocardiography , cardiopulmonary exercise test , cardiac magnetic resonance tomography myocardial biopsy patient ) make possible establish relationship result histology image ; quantify qualify fibrosis vivo , evaluate LVF vs. general cardiopulmonary function optimize health care prior operation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AORTIC VALVE DISEASE &amp; VENTRICULAR FUNCTION Aortic valve disease common valvular heart disease Europe ( 46.4 % ) . The valve stenotic ( aortic stenosis , AS ) leak ( aortic regurgitation , AR ) . While mostly elderly patient suffer AS ( steadily grow group due increase population 60 year ) , AR occur young individual ( 20-60 year general ) still work long life expectancy . The current treatment aortic valve replacement ( AVR ) Sweden approx . 1800 AVR perform every year increase tendency . AVR procedure low mortality ( 1.7 % ) nevertheless limited information available postoperative morbidity , physical performance quality life . Present guideline suggest surgery patient present symptom and/or show impairment LVF ( increase LV diameter , decline ejection fraction - EF ) . These though fairly crude measure symptom LV dilatation occur late natural history disease . Furthermore , find previously symptoms LVF correlate warrant quest search precise indicator . AS cause pressure AR cause volume overload LV compensate concentric eccentric hypertrophy initially . As disease progress even histological change present e.g . diffuse fibrosis . Regional fibrosis myocardial infarction know cause impaired LVF . However , information available medical literature diffuse myocardial fibrosis affect LVF whether would reversible follow prosthetic valve implantation . Cardiac surgery always carry risk complication ( e.g . mortality , stroke , postoperative arrhythmia , infection etc . ) life prosthetic heart valve necessarily uncomplicated . Our previous study show preoperative impairment LVF irreversible , Gjertson show , progress heart failure despite operation . Postoperative heart failure profound impact long-term prognosis . FIBROSIS &amp; CARDIAC MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING ( cMRI ) Well define ischemic scar visualize reliably cMRI late gadolinium enhancement make useful diagnostic modality myocardial viability clinical practice . Currently , in-vivo information diffuse myocardial fibrosis limit optimal image method clinical use establish yet . BIOMARKERS Biomarkers myocardial fibrosis use diagnostic tool heart failure emerge lately . However , diagnostic predictive value diffuse myocardial fibrosis AS patient study yet . The present study examines diffuse myocardial fibrosis pre- postoperatively AS patient , thus provide possibility evaluate fibrosis biomarkers contribute diagnostic/predictive marker diffuse myocardial fibrosis and/or myocardial remodel . Based hypothesis amount location fibrotic tissue connect impairment LVF severe aortic valve disease . We aim validate special sequence ( developed Link√∂ping ) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( cMRI ) diagnostic tool get information reversibility myocardial fibrosis . In addition , plan survey physical capacity cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) pre- postoperatively study relationship physical performance capacity , fibrosis LVF . METHODS During cMRI T1 T2 map three ventricular slice equally space short axis direction perform . Gadolinium contrast give renew T1 map allow calculation distribution volume , take sign fibrosis . Functional data calculate cine image . Flow image generate 2D phase contrast record through-plane flow time flow area produce estimate stroke volume cardiac output . In 4D phase contrast recording , LV inflow characterize term four flow compartment well presence absence vortex intraventricular flow pattern . 3D-QALAS ( 3D-quantification use interleaved Look-Locker acquisition sequence T2 preparation pulse ) base 3D spoiled Turbo Field Echo sequence use inversion recovery interleave T2 preparation . It allow rapid acquisition provide quantitative information T1 T2 relaxation time scan full coverage LV . NT-proBNP , HsTnT , marker myocardial fibrosis take assess relation parameter fibrosis heart muscle . Intraoperatively 5 biopsy ( 1.2 mm ) take LV standardized fashion . Samples dye analyse image quantification program verification quantification fibrosis . CPET record data cardiovascular respiratory system stress simultaneously .</detailed_description>
