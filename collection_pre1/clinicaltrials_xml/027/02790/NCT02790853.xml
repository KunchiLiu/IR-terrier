	<brief_title>Multimodal Imaging Surveillance Patients With Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Visits : While participant study , 4 study visit already schedule , routine clinic visit . Each visit last 20-25 minute total . During visit , participant mouth examine imaged brush tissue biopsy check cancerous pre-cancerous lesion . These test procedure describe . Mouth Exam Imaging : Two ( 2 ) different kind image device use study compare standard white light exam . One type , PS2.1/PS3 , design let researcher look wide area line mouth ( size top soda ) shin different color light mouth take picture . The imaging device call high-resolution microendoscope ( HRME ) design let researcher look take picture small area line mouth high magnification ( like microscope ) . If participant find eligible take part study agree , mouth exam mouth scan type image device picture mouth lesion take . Normal ( non-lesion ) tissue participant 's mouth may also image . First , participant standard white light mouth exam . During exam , study doctor look lesion participant 's mouth picture find lesion take . After white light mouth exam , study doctor take picture inside participant 's mouth use PS2.1/PS3 image device . Participant also picture mouth take HRME . To , color substance call proflavine hemisulfate ( type fluorescent dye glow green dark ) `` paint '' area participant 's mouth cotton tip help improve picture . Then , small probe ( size pencil tip ) HRME place lesion normal area inside participant 's mouth light end HRME probe use take picture . After picture take , participant rinse mouth water . It take 5-10 minute total participant 's mouth examine imaged white light , use PS2.1/PS3 device , HRME . Brush Biopsy Tissue Biopsies : After image complete , participant brush biopsy mouth check cell cancerous learn change cell visit . To perform brush biopsy , member study staff gently rotate brush along surface mouth . This test similar `` Pap Smear '' test use screen woman cervical cancer . Participant also tissue biopsy check tissue cancerous pre-cancerous . To collect tissue biopsy , participant 's mouth numb local anesthesia small cut tool use remove tissue lesion . The result biopsy compare image take PS2.1/PS3 HRME device learn image device accurately predict lesion cancerous pre-cancerous . It take 15 minute complete biopsy . The mouth exam , imaging , biopsy take place day routine clinic visit . Length Study : Patient 's participation study complete follow-up . Follow-Up : About 30 day participant 's last clinic visit , medical record check and/or member study staff may call learn side effect image device . If participant call , call last 5 minute . This investigational study . The HRME PS2.1/PS3 image device FDA approve commercially available . Their use study consider investigational . Proflavine hemisulfate FDA approve commercially available treat umbilical cord stump newborn baby . Proflavine hemisulfate FDA approve commercially available use dye mouth . Its use study consider investigational . The study doctor explain participant imaging device design work . Up 600 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
