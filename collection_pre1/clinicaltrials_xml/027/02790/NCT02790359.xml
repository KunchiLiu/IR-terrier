	<brief_summary>The safety effectiveness esophagogastroduodenoscopy colonoscopy detection gastrointestinal-tract pathology child establish last three decade . Insufflation intestinal tract , usually room air , necessary improve visualization procedure ; however , air bowel also result abdominal distension increase pain . This potential discomfort associate upper endoscopy colonoscopy may important barrier patient undergoing procedure . Insufflation carbon dioxide another method use endoscopic procedure distention lumen currently use Children 's Hospital Wisconsin base provider preference . The aim study perform randomize controlled trial compare insufflation room air carbon dioxide patient undergoing routine upper endoscopy colonoscopy . The investigator primary outcome measurement patient comfort level measure pain score recovery . The investigator hypothesize carbon dioxide insufflation endoscopy colonoscopy improve patient comfort level compare insufflation room air . Secondary outcome measure include change end tidal carbon dioxide , time discharge , duration colonoscopy cecal intubation rate , change abdominal girth , rescue pain medication use recovery post-procedure event . This prospective randomize single-blinded study . The investigator recruit consecutive patient , age 8 21 year , schedule elective outpatient upper endoscopy colonoscopy child 's hospital Wisconsin March 2015 reach target population number . The investigator exclude inpatient , non-English speaking patient , child 8 year age , patient undergo colonic manometry study , patient hemodynamic instability , gastrointestinal bleeding , acute abdomen , previous colectomy , oxygen-dependent pulmonary disease obstructive sleep apnea require use continuous positive airway pressure device . On basis computer-generated randomization scheme 1:1 ratio , patient assign receive room air carbon dioxide insufflation colonoscopy . Power calculation do determine need enroll 100 patient arm study . Informed consent obtain patient endoscopist gastrointestinal fellow .</brief_summary>
