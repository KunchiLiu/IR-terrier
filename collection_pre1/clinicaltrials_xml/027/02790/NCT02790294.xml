	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate suitability delay magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) management spine tumor . Currently standard care obtain MRI scan early postoperative period ( within 72 hour surgery ) . The purpose study see delay MRI ( 2 3 week surgery ) similar quality earlier MRI . In study patient undergo 2 MRIs surgery instead one MRI . Patients one MRI 3 day surgery one MRI 2-3 week surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary aim : Assess Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) 2 3 week surgery lead clinical decision probability choose physician guide subsequent management patient , compare immediately postoperative MRI . Secondary aim : Investigate difference early late MRI comparing : - Size tumor three dimension ; - Extent edema ; - Presence extent fluid collection ; - Spine Oncology Study Group score ; - Involvement adjacent level ; - Progression tumor ; - Patient 's preference/performance scale right image take : level discomfort around time MRI perform . Study Design : This prospective diagnostic study standard care currently exist .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Metastatic primary malignant tumor involve spinal column , without extension epidural space Operated debulking , decompression separation surgery ; A magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan perform within 72 hour surgery need ; Image quality acceptable comparison later MRI read neuroradiologist ; Karnofsky score 60 high ; Able consent study . Any patient previously underwent spinal surgery level exclude eliminate late postoperative change . Intradural extension tumor . Patients , whose MRI post operative 4872 hour readable due artifact disease process shall include study . Patient able tolerate MRI scan due claustrophobia severe pain allergic reaction contrast . Patients estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate ( eGFR ) &lt; = 30 exclude avoid issue relate contrast administration patient . This Glomerular Filtration Rate ( GFR ) threshold cutoff level choose per institutional policy , level measure would require ( hydration contrast administration ) . In order keep image information uniform possible small study group , patient low GFR enrol study .</criteria>
