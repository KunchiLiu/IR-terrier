	<detailed_description>Chronic non-healing wound represent major source morbidity , disability , mortality diabetic patient . Diabetes lead cause non-traumatic limb amputation worldwide . Many patient ischemic neuroischemic wound candidate surgical/endovascular revascularization , owe anatomical vascular reason underlie condition co-morbidities . Therefore , identification novel medical treatment strategy improve wound heal diabetic patient major challenge clinician , researcher , health care system . Defects bone marrow ( BM ) -derive stem progenitor cell , include EPCs , contribute diabetic complication . Stem cell mobilize agent previously study adjunctive therapy critical limb ischemia chronic non-healing wound diabetic non-diabetic patient , well treatment diabetic wound infection . Meta-analyses study indicate stem cell mobilization clinical condition safe potentially effective improve surrogate outcome measure hard endpoint ( rate wound heal amputation ) . However , diabetes impairs response commonly agent use mobilize stem cell , namely human recombinant granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( hrG-CSF ) . This notion come extensive data animal model , retrospective case series patient hematological disorder , meta-analysis study conduct patient cardiovascular disease , proof-of-concept prospective study otherwise healthy outpatient . Vice versa , data strongly indicate diabetic patient adequately mobilize stem/progenitor cell ( include vascular progenitor , like EPCs ) response CXCR4 antagonist Plerixafor . Plerixafor ( Mozobil , Sanofi ) clinically available Europe ( include Italy ) second-line regimen stem cell mobilization patient myeloma lymphoma schedule autotransplantation , combination hrG-CSF , failure hrG-CSF alone , mobilize sufficient amount CD34+ stem cell start apheresis . Preclinical study animal model delay diabetic wound heal support idea Plerixafor effective adjunct therapy accelerate diabetic wound healing . This study plan evaluate whether single injection Plerixafor improve wound heal diabetic patient stage III-IV ( neuro ) ischemic wound .</detailed_description>
