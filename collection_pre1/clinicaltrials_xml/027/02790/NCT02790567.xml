	<brief_title>Rapid Diagnosis Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Surgical Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) concern critically ill patient , give high prevalence heparin use . The diagnosis HIT surgical intensive care unit ( ICU ) problematic due lack reliable diagnostic method . No gold standard currently exist definitive diagnosis mainly base detection heparin-dependent platelet-activating antibody ELISA method , platelet serotonin release assay ( SRA ) change blood platelet count discontinuation heparin therapy . As result , early definitive diagnosis could do . This could expose patient thrombotic complication relate HIT hemorrhagic complication related alternative anticoagulant prescribe . This complication threaten prognosis patient . Particle gel immunoassay automate immunoassay propose early diagnosis HIT medical critically ill non-critically ill patient . Many author suggest accuracy immunological method diagnosis HIT could alter surgical patient , test never specifically evaluated population . The 4Ts HIT Expert Probability ( HEP ) score system sound interesting diagnosis HIT . These clinicobiological score easily use non-expert clinician , also never evaluate surgical ICU .</detailed_description>
