	<brief_summary>Rationale : Breast cancer-related lymphedema ( BCRL ) one underestimated complication breast cancer treatment report incidence 30 % 40 % axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND ) 7 % sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) . Although axillary treatment regimens change focus less aggressive axillary treatment order reduce morbidity without compromise survival , BCRL still remain relevant problem future . Objective : To improve breast cancer survivorship reducing/eliminating one debilitate upper-body morbidity relate breast cancer treatment : chronic lymphedema arm . Study design : A multicenter , randomize control trial ( RCT ) carry Maastricht University Medical Center , VieCuri Medical Center Zuyderland Medical Center Netherlands . Study population : The study population include woman 18 year old underwent surgical treatment early stage breast cancer SLNB ALND , receive axillary radiotherapy , present early stage lymphedema arm ( stage 1 2a ISL classification lymphedema ) . Intervention : In RCT patient randomize two arm : first group continue standard care conservative lymphedema therapy , second group undergo lymphaticovenous anastomosis ( LVA ) plastic surgeon . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study parameter difference excess limb volume ( ELV ) one treatment , effect treatment quality life cost-effectiveness treatment . Study-specific procedure : After randomization follow-up moment 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 24 month . A follow-up moment include interview medical examination . During examination , upper limb assess sensory , motor , strength mobility change . Furthermore , investigator measure volume treat untreated side use water displacement method circumference measurement . A lymphoscintigraphy make inclusion , 12 month 24 month . Lastly , subject ask certain time point fill five questionnaire : Lymph-ICF , EORTC QLQ-C30 , EORTC QLQ-BR23 , EQ-5D-5L DASH questionnaire .</brief_summary>
