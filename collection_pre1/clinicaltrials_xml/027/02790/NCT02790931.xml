	<brief_title>Effects Personalized Intervention Gait Velocity Functionality Diabetic Neuropathic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomize control trial perform 46 patient diabetic neuropathy . The participant randomly assign either control group ( recommended foot care international consensus exercise ) intervention group receive 12-week physical therapy exercise , twice week , supervision physiotherapist , twice week remotely supervise software home . Every exercise progression depend subject ' execution , increase intensity difficulty . The subject evaluate 5 different moment . The self-selected walking speed investigate photocell incidence foot ulcer register web software one year longitudinal study . Through force platform infrared camera , kinetics kinematics gait allow assessment joint moment , power propulsion , foot ankle range motion . The hypothesis personalize exercise ankle-foot complex via software increase self-selected gait speed , reduce incidence plantar ulcer risk , increase health functionality foot , increase foot strength ankle isometric torque , maintain temperature foot , produce beneficial biomechanical change gait .</detailed_description>
