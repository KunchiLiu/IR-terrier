	<brief_summary>Venous ulceration major burden NHS . Current treatment involve bandage therapy replace twice weekly basis . The Juxta-CuresTM device offer alternative solution long-term treatment patient venous ulceration . This removable adjustable device inbuilt pressure monitor . The aim study determine whether Juxta-Cures™ device provide least equivalent ulcer heal patient venous ulceration compare bandaging . Secondary outcome measure include whether Juxta-Cures™ device improve patient compliance quality life compare bandaging , whether Juxta-Cures™ device cost effective compare bandaging .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Juxta-CuresTM Versus Bandaging Venous Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants low leg ulceration identify consultant nurse-led clinic . They assess clinician , identify likely venous ulcer . Participants undergo current leg ulcer management type may consider trial . At stage participant give recent version patient information sheet , give appropriate initial treatment determine clinician ( simple dressing , compression bandage appropriate ) , book venous arterial duplex well ABPI undertake within 10 +/- 4 day . The patient review 10 day +/- 4 day venous ulcer clinic discus query regard trial clinician . Informed consent obtain participant point appropriate , patient randomise , ( minimum 24 hour require patient read information prior give informed consent ) . Following randomisation participant review leg ulcer clinic 10 +/- 4 day basis whereby pressure monitoring conduct use PicoPress® ( Microlan Italia , Padua , Italy ) , dressing change ulcer measure standard 1cm squared grid , Silhoutte® 3D wound image system ( ARANZ Medical Ltd , Christchurch , New Zealand ) . Participants also submit daily use pressure diary . The type dressing apply also record well length appointment . 50 participant recruit ( aim study duration 12-18 month ) consultant nurse-led clinic Colchester Hospital associate outlying clinic , participant randomise receive either compression bandage Juxta-Cures™ ( bilateral participant allocate single treatment , rather randomisation individual limb ) . Patients 'wet ' ulcer may receive absorbent dressing Juxta-Cures™ compression bandage study period , record weekly data collection cost analysis purpose . At baseline , 1 month , 3 month 6 month participant complete health relate quality life questionnaire . The disease specific VEINESqol/sym , generic Euroqol-5D-5L survey use , receive positive feedback regard content patient focus group . The planned study period randomised-control trial 24 week participant , 1 year total patient recruitment analysis . This study feasibility study therefore power . Following study investigator aim undertake multi-centre study collaboration Vascular Endovascular Research Network ( VERN ) , power venous ulcer heal 90 % power , use result feasibility study .</detailed_description>
