	<criteria>1 . Histologically cytologically proven nonsmall cell lung cancer . 2 . Patients must clinical AJCC stage IIIA IIIB ( AJCC , 7th ed . ) nonoperable disease ; nonoperable disease determine multidisciplinary treatment team . 3 . Patients multiple , ipsilateral pulmonary nodule ( T3 , T4 ) eligible definitive course daily fractionate RT plan . 4 . Appropriate stage protocol entry , include distant metastasis , base upon follow minimum diagnostic workup : 1 . History/physical examination , include documentation weight , within 2 week prior registration ; 2 . CT scan sim CT chest upper abdomen ( IV contrast recommend unless medically contraindicate ) within 6 week prior registration ; 3 . CT scan brain ( contrast recommend unless medically contraindicate ) MRI brain within 6 week prior registration ; 4 . Pulmonary function test , include DLCO , within 6 week prior registration ; patient must FEV1 ≥ 1.2 Liter ≥ 50 % predict without bronchodilator ; 5 . Zubrod Performance Status 01 within 2 week prior registration ; 6 . Age ≥ 18 ; 7 . Able tolerate PET/CT imaging require perform ACR Imaging Core Lab qualify facility ; 8 . CBC/differential obtain within 2 week prior registration study , adequate bone marrow function ; 5 . Serum creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min within 2 week prior registration ; 6 . The patient must provide studyspecific inform consent prior study entry . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Any component small cell lung carcinoma . 2 . Evidence malignant pleural pericardial effusion . 3 . Prior invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) 3 year ; 4 . Prior systemic chemotherapy study cancer ; note prior chemotherapy different cancer allowable . 5 . Prior radiotherapy region study cancer would result overlap radiation therapy field ; 6 . Severe , active comorbidity , define follow : Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization within last 6 month ; Transmural myocardial infarction within last 6 month ; Acute bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time registration ; Hepatic insufficiency result clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defect ; note , however , laboratory test liver function coagulation parameter require entry protocol ; Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) base upon current CDC definition ; note , however , HIV test require entry protocol . The need exclude patient AIDS protocol necessary treatment involve protocol may significantly immunosuppressive . Protocolspecific requirement may also exclude immunocompromised patient . 7 . Pregnancy woman childbearing potential men sexually active willing use medically acceptable form contraception . 8 . Poorly control diabetes ( define fast glucose level &gt; 200 mg/dL ) ; 9 . Patients T4 disease radiographic evidence massive invasion large pulmonary artery tumor cause significant narrowing destruction artery exclude .</criteria>
