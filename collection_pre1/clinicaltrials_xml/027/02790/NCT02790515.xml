	<brief_summary>This study seek examine treatment therapy reduce regimen-related toxicity relapse promote rapid immune reconstitution limit serious graft-versus-host-disease ( GVHD ) also improve disease-free survival quality life . The investigator propose evaluate safety efficacy selective naive T-cell deplete ( TCRɑβ CD45RA depletion , respectively ) haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT ) follow reduce intensity condition regimen avoids radiation patient hematologic malignancy relapse refractory follow prior allogeneic transplantation . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To estimate engraftment day +42 post-transplant patient receive TCRɑβ-depleted CD45RA-depleted haploidentical donor 30ogenitor cell transplantation follow reduce intensity condition regimen without radiation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - Assess safety feasibility addition Blinatumomab early post-engraftment period patient CD19+ malignancy . - Estimate incidence malignant relapse , event-free survival , overall survival one-year post-transplantation . - Estimate incidence severity acute chronic ( GVHD ) . - Estimate rate transplant relate mortality ( TRM ) first 100 day transplantation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood progenitor cell obtain partially match adult family member ( donor ) . After process filtration use CliniMACS device , cell infuse participant meet eligibility criterion . Prior transplant , participant receive condition treatment rabbit ATG , cyclophosphamide , fludarabine , thiotepa , melphalan , rituximab . Mesna give help prevent side effect cyclophosphamide . Tacrolimus give help reduce risk GVHD . G-CSF give transplant help donor progenitor cell make white blood cell faster immune system well able fight infection . Blood progenitor cell give two infusion Day 0 Day +1 . Progenitor cell move blood stream bone marrow space begin grow . Participant blood monitor 100 day assure progenitor cell begin grow . If growth low , additional progenitor cell may give . Blood test monitor one year observe well donor cell grow effect infection-fighting system .</detailed_description>
