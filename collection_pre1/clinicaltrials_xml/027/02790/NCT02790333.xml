	<brief_title>Different Stapler Cartridge For Pancreatic Stump Texture To Prevent Pancreatic Fistula</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Distal pancreatectomy ( DP ) standard treatment symptomatic benign , premalignant , malignant lesion pancreatic body tail.Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy ( LDP ) report low blood loss , few postoperative complication shorter length stay without substantial increase operative time . Pancreatic fistula ( PF ) major source postoperative morbidity associate numerous complication , suffering , long hospital stay , high cost sometimes death . Frequencies range 5 % 64 % . Several procedure propose reduce rate PF . stapler closure consider safe approve particularly LDP . Numerous predictive factor PF report previous study . Among risk factor , important might texture thickness remnant pancreas . However , judgment pancreatic texture base surgeon 's observation still exist objective method assess pancreatic texture . Furthermore strict guideline type cartridge use accord pancreatic stump texture thickness . Therefore , single blind randomize control trial design establish objective criterion assess pancreatic stump texture , unify stapler cartridge accord pancreatic stump texture thickness . Patients stratify intraoperatively gland textureâ€”hard ( fibrotic ) soft ( normal ) subsequently randomize accord different stapler cartridge . Pancreatic fibrosis access histopathology pancreatic stellate cell .</detailed_description>
