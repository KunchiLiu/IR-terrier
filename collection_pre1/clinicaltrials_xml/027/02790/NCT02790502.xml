	<brief_summary>Globally , one-third edible food lose waste 1 . Wasted food depletes resource use produce food ( matter definition , `` produce '' include activity distribute , package prepare food human consumption venue , include grow , transport processing ) , deprive hungry people need nutrition represent common ( &gt; 20 % ) environmentally deleterious component ( term greenhouse gas ) US landfills3-6 . The Organization Economic Co-operation Development ( OECD ) identify reduce FW key increase global food security ( OECD 2011 ) 7 . The Obama Administration recently announce first ever FW reduction goal United States 50 % 2030 . USDA EPA pursue goal via partnership private sector , charitable faith-based organization , well state , local tribal government . In developed economy , consumer large source FW via home preparation din out2 , 8 . In order achieve FW goal , must anticipate consumer FW generation handle decision respond propose policy intervention . However , exist substantial barrier measure consumer FW : exist method high respondent burden yield bias measurement FW generation9-11 . In project test smartphone application ( app ) measure household FW .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective project pilot test Remote Food Photography Method ( RFPM ) SmartIntake smartphone app approach measure food waste control free-living environment . The RFPM SmartIntakeTM app constitutes distinct improvement self-report FI method , pen-and-paper survey dietary recall method rely subject ' ability accurately recall type portion size food consume . After training , people use SmartIntakeTM app capture image food eat occasion . Photos automatically upload user 's smartphone secure server Pennington Biomedical . The image analyze quantify food selection , food waste , food intake use validate method computer program ( Food Photography ApplicationÂ© ) build Pennington Biomedical . The method find accurately quantify food selection , food waste , food intake . Importantly , RFPM SmartIntakeTM app eliminate one large source error associate self-report method - subject ' inability accurately estimate portion size , account ~50 % error self-report methods11 , 13-15 . FI estimation study observe overweight subject react monitor underestimating self-reported amount FI eat less monitored16 , 17 . Similarly , FW behavioral study observe subject start self-reporting small amount FW , however clear result increase awareness less generation , due appear wasteful individuals18 . However , people respond less RFPM/SmartIntake app experiment result show underestimation RFPM vary energy intake level12 . Many shortcoming plague FI measurement likely hamper FW measurement . Biases opposite direction ( e.g. , clean plate show less FW ) likely emerge measure FW may similarly mitigate propose app . We believe use RFPM SmartIntakeTM app base FW estimation app hold great promise transform FW measurement . First , note FW associate din situation ( i.e. , plate waste ) directly estimate RFPM , hence simple transform current output require . To fully adapt RFPM FW measurement , procedure modify estimate FW create food preparation store food purge ( e.g. , clean fridge ) . The RFPM method already work dine-out setting , currently omit exist FW measurement method . Additional functionality , estimate edible v inedible FW ( hence calorie waste ) , estimate waste rate among food category , estimate rate diversion landfill , also explore multiple policy relevant metric instantly calculate store .</detailed_description>
