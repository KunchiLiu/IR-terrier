	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Despite recent improvement quality care , in-hospital cardiac arrest still associate high probability poor outcome . Patients resuscitate vasopressor-requiring cardiac arrest frequently exhibit early postresuscitation hemodynamic instability poorly responsive hemodynamic support high vasopressor dos intravenous fluid titrate cardiac filling pressure least 12 mmHg . Furthermore , precede study indicate postresuscitation disease `` sepsis-like '' syndrome characterize plasma cytokine elevation , endotoxemia , coagulopathy adrenal insufficiency contribute postresuscitation shock . Steroids currently use improve hemodynamics septic patient , however , effect postresuscitation hemodynamics thoroughly elucidate yet . OBJECTIVES To determine whether stress-dose steroid supplementation cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) improve hemodynamic parameter ( arterial blood pressure , cardiac output , cerebral blood flow ) patient in-hospital cardiac arrest . Furthermore study effect steroid administration inflammatory response organ failure , determine potential , corticosteroid-associated complication hyperglycemia , infection , bleed peptic ulcer paresis . In summary , aim directly assess physiological effect safety steroid CPR . The possible clinical usefulness steroid CPR - context early postresuscitation hemodynamic support - currently correspond important knowledge gap , recently acknowledge Guidelines Evidence Reviewers . METHODS SETTING Intensive/coronary care unit , ( ICUs/CCUs ) Evaggelismos Hospital , Athens , Greece ( 1,200 bed ) Larissa University Hospital , Larissa , Greece ( 700 bed ) . PATIENTS Inclusion criterion : Patients experience in-hospital , vasopressor-requiring cardiac arrest , accord guideline resuscitation 2015 . Exclusion criterion report dedicated subsection . ETHICS AND INFORMED CONSENT The study conduct concordance European Union Clinical Trials Regulation No 536/2014 Helsinki Declaration . Due emergency situation , consent request steroid supplementation CPR . The patient ' family patient regain consciousness communication ability follow-up inform study soon possible , objection result exclusion patient data subsequent analysis . Informed , write next-of-kin consent non-written patient consent ( whenever feasible ) request soon possible stress-dose hydrocortisone postresuscitation shock continue participation study . If consent obtain patient death , patient 's next kin inform study permission inclusion patient data subsequent analysis request . All consent procedure additionally document patient 's medical record . The original protocol version approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) Evaggelismos General Hospital July 14 2016 ( Approval No . 126/16-6-2016 ) , IRB Larissa University Hospital October 10 , 2016 ( Approval No . 46113/11-10-2016 - IRB Discussion No . 13/10-10-2016 Θ.6 ) . Subsequent protocol amendment approve Evaggelismos IRB January 24 , 2017 ( Approval No . 8/26-1-2017 ) , communicate IRB Larissa University Hospital . STUDY DESIGN We propose prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel- group clinical trial . RANDOMIZATION Research Randomizer version 4 ( http : //www.randomizer.org/ ) use study statistician group allocation . For study center , random number ( range , 1-100 ) generate set 4 . Each random number set unique correspond 1 consecutively enrolled patient . In set , odd even first number result assignment correspond patient control steroid group , respectively . In study center , group allocation rule know solely pharmacist prepare study drug . CPR AND POSTRESUSCITATION INTERVENTIONS We enrol adult in-patients cardiac arrest due ventricular fibrillation/pulseless tachycardia responsive three direct current countershocks , asystole , pulseless electrical activity . Study treatment administer first CPR cycle postenrollment . Patients randomize receive either methylprednisolone 40 mg ( Steroids group ) normal saline placebo ( Control group ) first , postenrollment CPR cycle . Otherwise , advance life support conduct accord 2015 guideline resuscitation . After resuscitation , patient treat either stress-dose hydrocortisone 240 mg daily 7 day maximum ( Steroids group ) , saline placebo ( Control group ) . More specifically , 4 hour ROSC , patient receive 100 mL/day ( average pump infusion rate ~ 4.2 mL/h ) normal saline either contain stress-dose hydrocortisone ( Steroids group ) solely saline placebo ( Control group ) maximum 9 day . On day 8 9 hydrocortisone dose Steroids group taper 120 mg 60 mg , respectively , finally discontinue day 10 postrandomization . On ICU/CCU admission , patient receive central venous line , arterial line , either standard part pulsatility index continuous cardiac output monitoring . Patients standard arterial line also receive pulmonary artery catheter , provide attend physician also agree . DOCUMENTATION AND PATIENT FOLLOW-UP CPR attempt document accord Utstein style . Hemodynamics gas-exchange , electrolytes , glucose , central body temperature , lactate administer fluid vasopressor/inotropic support determined/recorded CPR , ~20 min ~4 hour well 24 , 48 72 hour return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) ; ROSC define sustain presence palpable arterial pulse least 20 min . Postresuscitation cardiac output monitor least 72 hour post-ROSC , postresuscitation cardiac function assess ultrasonography within first hour ICU admission 72 hour post-ROSC . Central-venous blood gas analysis also perform aforementioned time point blood sample take determination cytokine approximately 20 min 4 , 24 , 48 , 72 hour post-ROSC . Follow-up first 10 day postrandomization include 1 ) Determination/recording hemodynamics hemodynamic support , gas-exchange , fluid balance precede 24 hour , arterial blood lactate central venous oxygen saturation 9 a.m. ; 2 ) Daily determination serum pro-inflammatory cytokine , 3 ) Daily record ( within 8-9 a.m. ) laboratory data , prescribed medication . The result 4 daily determination ( 1 every 6 hour ) blood glucose also record subsequently analyze incidence hyperglycemia ( blood glucose exceed 200 mg/dL -11.1 mmol/L ) . Follow-up day 60 post-ROSC include organ failure , ventilator-free day . Morbidity/complications throughout ICU/CCU hospital stay , time ICU/CCU hospital discharge also record . Study outcomes report dedicated subsection . PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS [ Approved , January 24 , 2017 ] Amendment : 1 . Part A : Postresuscitation Cardiac Output ( CO ) move primary secondary study outcome ( see also Outcome Measures ' subsection ) . Reason amendment : We ultimately anticipate able collect data &lt; 50 % patient . Part B : Furthermore , measurement time point `` 8 hour postresuscitation '' long part protocol apply total physiological measurement . This aim limit attend investigator workload . Amendment 2 : Further clarification regard `` acceptable '' time frame ICU / CCU admission successfully resuscitate patient . This important logistical issue include measure ( e.g . monitor medical service support oversight ) optimize quality care ICU admission specification `` maximum acceptable time ICU admission '' . In VSE 1 2 study , time 12 hour . During 2016 , Evaggelismos Department Intensive Care Medicine experience reduction 5 ICU bed ( i.e . 30 25 ) 8 HDU ( high-dependency unit ) bed 20 12 . Therefore , regard cardiac arrest patient , decide extend target time limit admission 24 hour . Regarding CORTICA , delay report `` unpreventable '' protocol breach , case possible extreme circumstance ( e.g . severe flu outbreak ) , patient project ICU admission time 48 hour exclude . Hence , `` project ICU admission time 48 hour '' constitute additional exclusion criterion . Amendment 3 : Further clarification `` terminal illness '' exclusion criterion - life expectancy 6 week ) : ( ) Patients metastatic cancer [ confirm bone and/or brain metastasis ] , and/or primary / metastatic disease cause respiratory failure with/without additional organ-system failure [ define correspond Sequential Organ Dysfunction Assessment ( SOFA ) subscore 3 4 ] ; ( ii ) Patients pre-arrest bad SOFA score &gt; =15 ( correspond probability death least 90 % ) ; ( ii ) Patients immunosuppression new , hospital-acquired septic complication ) . Amendment 4 : Addition follow Exclusion Criterion : `` Any deviation hospital 's standard resuscitative procedure '' ( e.g . poor adherence standard Advanced Life Support algorithm epinephrine dose error use atropine , `` unjustified '' interruption chest compression compromise CPR quality ) . Amendment 5 : Addition follow Exclusion Criterion : Pre-arrest diagnosis `` active '' peptic ulcer ; , either precede gastroscopic confirmation peptic ulcer , clinical evidence acute , pre-arrest gastrointestinal bleeding , attributable peptic ulcer disease . Amendment 6 : Follow-up first 10 day : The time determination cytokine 20 min , 4 , 24 , 48 , 72 hour post ROSC [ specify correspond outcome measure ] , 7 day post-ROSC ( , determination day 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 cancel ) ; Reason change : Study cost reduction . STATISTICS Data report mean±standard deviation , median ( interquartile range ) , number ( percentage ) , unless otherwise specify . Distribution normality test Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . Dichotomous categorical variable compare two-sided chi-square Fisher 's exact test . Continuous variable compare two-tailed , independent sample test Mann-Whitney exact U test . P- value multiple t-test comparison subject Bonferroni correction . We use mixed model analysis compare repeatedly measure variable two group . Survival data analyze previously employ methodology multivariable Cox regression . Based previously publish data mean arterial pressure 24 hour postresuscitation , detect effect size 0.761 α error probability 0.015 power 0.80 , need enroll total 88 patient ( 44 group ) . A target enrollment 100 patient ROSC least 20 min likely adequately compensate possible dropout miss data . This target enrollment actually correspond alpha value 0.008 power 0.80 accord aforementioned , predicted effect size 0.761 . Expected result pertain steroid-associated benefit respect primary outcome , consistent result secondary outcome .</detailed_description>
