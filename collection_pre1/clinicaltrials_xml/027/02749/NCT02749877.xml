The aim interdisciplinary longitudinal study extend empirical knowledge training transfer effect child history cancer .

	<brief_title>Efficacy Cognitive Physical Trainings Pediatric Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims Hypotheses : The overall purpose study threefold : first , study aim deepen knowledge particular pattern long-term cognitive impairment pediatric cancer survivor . Understanding nature cognitive deficit population helpful develop tailored therapeutic strategy . Second , availability well-designed child-friendly evidence-based training major clinical relevance prevent school problem decline cognitive function . Third , detection training-induced neuronal change white-matter structure give insight functional plasticity child 's brain . In addition , training-induced change white matter would build strong evidence effect particular intervention . The following hypothesis assess particular present study : 1 . Children history brain tumor ( BT ) show particular problem memory attention , result general deficit several cognitive area . Children history cancer without involvement CNS show few problem child history cancer BT cognitive domain problem healthy control child . 2 . Standardized work memory train lead improvement work memory performance . Transfer train effect especially area executive function , memory attention expect . 3 . Physical training lead improvement coordination , endurance motor strength . A transfer several cognitive area ( i.e . executive function ) physical self-concept expect . 4 . After work memory train physical training , white matter structure patient show significant change fractional anisotropy . There also change functional connectivity . 5 . Neuropsychological effect train still present 6 month post train experimental group . All comparison carry individual level ( intra-individual level , primary objective ) well inter-individual level ( between-groups comparison , secondary objective ) . The level significance set Î± = 0.05 . Participants : Cancer Survivors : Researchers include 150 child adolescent age 7-16 year receive initial diagnosis cancer / without CNS ( central nervous system ) involvement past 10 year terminate treatment ( surgery , radiation , / chemotherapy ) least 12 month prior participation study . Cancer survivor recruit two different specialize pediatric unit Switzerland . In order minimize heterogeneity sample , child history cancer without CNS involvement surgical removal tumor without subsequent radiation / chemotherapy exclude study . Because increased likelihood drop-out child history cancer longitudinal study , statistically require quantity participant ( &gt; 25 child per group ) recruit reach sufficient statistical power . Healthy Controls : 40 healthy child adolescent ( match age gender ) include first assessment serve healthy control sample . They recruit mainly via sibling , include cancer survivor group also personal acquaintance among hospital staff study collaborator . Design The present study design randomize stratify control trial include two intervention group , one wait group ( child history cancer [ CNS+ CNS- ] healthy control group ( match age gender ) . Some child patient group allocate waiting-control group determine train effect ( train start later ) . After random assignment respective condition , interventional material ( XBOX computer ) , instal participant home . Thereby , supervise first train session take place . The executive function well detail effect single intervention session ( enjoyment , arousal etc . ) examine . Subsequently , respective group either follow standardize , computerized work memory train physical training . Neuropsychological assessment carry intervention / train re-performed participant end memory training physical training 6 month posttraining . Structural functional imaging perform prior shortly work memory train physical training . A 3 Tesla whole body MRI system use ( Siemens ; Erlangen , Germany ) . Anatomical imaging obtain use sequence T1 weight structural brain imaging whole brain coverage . Structural connectivity image acquire use q-ball sequence , functional connectivity measure use multiband echo planar image sequence ( MB EPI ) . Pre- post-processing structural data perform use SPM8 ( Welcome Departement Imaging Neuroscience , London ) MATLAB program ( MATLAB version 8.2 ) . In order perform functional connectivity analysis , CONN fMRI connectivity toolbox 13.1 ( Whitfield-Gabrieli &amp; Nieto-Castanon , 2012 ) use . The fractional anisotropy map provide Siemens software directly use statistical evaluation . Interventions : All 150 participant history cancer randomly stratify manner assign 3 group ( group A , B C ) ( see Fig.1 ) . Training A : Group A ( n1= 25 CNS+ , n2 = 25 CNS- ) undergo work memory training program . The child receive individual memory training base computer program Cogmed RM ( Klingberg et al. , 2005 ) supervise trained neuropsychologists . Its efficacy use child cancer recently publish ( e.g . Hardy et al. , 2012 ) . The child undergo 25 training session `` online '' ; session take 45 minute consist selection various task target different aspect work memory . The difficulty level training always adjust base user 's performance . The child perform memory training program home period 8 week . The child license Cogmed RM coach ( neuropsychologist ) review monitor result day 's training online . In initial session Hospital ( Zurich Bern ) Cogmed RM coach plan structure train together child parent . The coach provide weekly supervision feedback child 's performance progress via phone call child 's home . In close session child parent , train experience review . Training B : Group B ( n1= 25 CNS+ , n2 = 25 CNS- ) receive physical training execute home . The training base xbox Kinect game ( e.g . Shape Up ) comprise game activity jump ' n'run game , physical training , dance activity . All material provide Inselspital Bern . One training session last approximately 45 minute perform 3days week period 8 week . Group C ( n1= 25 CNS+ , n2 = 25 CNS- ) serve wait control group receive either physical work memory train program completion Neuropsychological Assessment II .</detailed_description>
