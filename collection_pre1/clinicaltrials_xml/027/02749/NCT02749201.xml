	<brief_title>Transmitted Light Tissue Thickness Analysis ( TiLTT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The common surgical procedure weight loss sleeve gastrectomy . The laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG ) involve linear staple stomach use staple device [ e.g . Echelon ( Ethicon Somerset NJ ) ] fire multiple time along length stomach thereby excise 80-90 % stomach leave patient `` sleeve '' stomach rather normal anatomical pouch . The gastric wall varies thickness thus varied staple size available use . Staple sizes range 2.0mm-5.0mm height . In standard surgical practice surgeon choose size staple cartridge subsequent fire base experience estimation thickness stomach tissue give region . The drawback technique highly inaccurate . If surgeon 's estimation error , staple height chosen may either tall short lead bleeding leakage staple malformed/unformed staple lead staple line failure . Any error lead devastate complication hemorrhage , leak , sepsis death . To date objective way measure thickness tissue staple thus staple choice relies entirely surgeon estimation inherently inaccurate . The investigator hypothesize light source place stomach lumen transmit light gastric wall . The amount light transmit , i.e . visible image device array external stomach , directly proportionate thickness stomach . This study take advantage fact routine procedure sleeve gastrectomy procedure light tube place gastric lumen via mouth . This device call Gastrisail 10 separate LED light array along length . This allow measurement transmit light intensity gastric wall 10 individual location along length f stomach . In addition study take advantage fact standard practice sleeve gastrectomy section stomach correspond location light excise sent pathological evaluation . This allow u measure actual thickness stomach 10 point corresponding location transmit light intensity . For measurement The investigator use standardize validated measurement tool/calipers . Now two set number investigator plan correlate degree transmit light intensity actual thickness measurement thereby reach algorithm allow transmit light intensity data alone predict gastric wall thickness . This provide surgeon entirely non-invasive objective measure gastric wall thickness hopefully improve his/her choice staple size surgical procedure thus improve safety .</detailed_description>
