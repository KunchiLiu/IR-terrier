	<brief_summary>This study test good bad effect study drug call enzalutamide . Enzalutamide could shrink cancer could also cause side effect . Researchers hope learn study drug shrink cancer least 30 % compare present size , least 1 5 patient . Enzalutamide FDA approve treat salivary gland cancer , already FDA-approved treat cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enzalutamide Patients With Androgen Receptor Positive Salivary Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single arm Phase II trial ass best overall response associate enzalutamide patient AR-positive salivary cancer . Given one first prospective study ever conduct AR-positive salivary cancer , currently standard therapy know effective disease , investigator adopt best overall response ( BOR ) 5 % null hypothesis BOR 20 % alternative hypothesis . In addition response , study also evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , adverse event , also try identify molecular predictor response examine genomic transcriptional element androgen receptor biology . The primary secondary objective study : Primary objective To evaluate rate best overall response associate enzalutamide patient AR-positive salivary cancer Secondary objective 1 . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) AR-positive salivary cancer patient treat enzalutamide 2 . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) AR-positive salivary cancer patient treat enzalutamide 3 . To evaluate safety/tolerability enzalutamide patient AR-positive salivary cancer Patients follow 3 year study enrollment .</detailed_description>
