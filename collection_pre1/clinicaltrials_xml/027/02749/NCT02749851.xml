	<brief_summary>The purpose study test application newly generate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) protocols assessment placental perfusion human subject . The primary objective validate establish utility placental MRI pregnant woman . The study entirely MRI-technology base collection placental tissue time infant delivery later correlative study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The placenta provide nutrition pregnant mother develop fetus . A placenta function normally need ensure normal fetal growth development . Unfortunately , placenta least understood human organ even though involved pregnancy complication . The placenta poorly understood current method look pregnancy , like ultrasound , provide enough information placental growth function . This study help provide information : - How placenta grow develops pregnancy - How placenta delivers nutrient , like oxygen develop fetus - If placental function use new advanced imaging tool predict pregnancy complication like fetal growth restriction , stillbirth , preeclampsia preterm labor This study explore blood flow placenta affect placental growth , fetal growth , oxygen delivery fetus . Blood flow placenta may determine placenta support fetal growth development . Having way measure placental function pregnancy may provide way understand normal pregnancy importantly also identify pregnancy increase risk pregnancy complication .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Pregnant woman recruit base inclusion criterion 3 subject group : 1. nonsmoker low risk placental insufficiency ( N=60 ) 2 . Smokers ( N=90 ) 3 . Nonsmokers high risk adverse outcome base prior clinical history ( N=150 ) Inclusion criterion : Pregnant woman fulfil inclusion criterion , meet exclusion criterion , invite participate study . Inclusion criterion group : 1 . Maternal age 18 year able give inform consent 2 . Pregnant patient , define positive pregnancy test elevate Î²human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) certain menstrual history , early ultrasound , identify prior to12 week gestation 3 . Intent deliver Oregon Health &amp; Science University ( OHSU ) Inclusion criterion low risk group : 1 . At least one successful pregnancy define nonanomalous , appropriate birth weight gestational age , singleton delivery 3741 week gestation evidence hypertensive disease . 2 . No history second third trimester loss 3 . No history fetal growth restriction 4 . No medical problem require chronic treatment 5 . No history preterm birth Inclusion criterion high risk group : 1 . Multiparous 2 . History pregnancy complicate placental insufficiency ( i.e . severe preeclampsia require preterm delivery , oligohydramnios ) immediately precede pregnancy 3 . Not currently smoker Exclusion criterion : These criterion exclude woman whose medication , personality trait obstetric condition could confound ability complete 1 hour MRI scan . 1 . Individuals intellectual disability incarcerate 2 . Multiple gestation 3 . Major fetal anomaly know associated abnormal growth ( i.e . major congenital heart defect , gastroschisis ) 4 . Current use vasoactive medication ( aspirin , heparin , antihypertensive ) . 5 . Current maternal history alcohol illicit drug use 6 . Current medical problem require chronic treatment : Cancer Endocrine disease ( include thyroid disease , adrenal disease ) Pregestational diabetes Renal disease alter renal function ( creatinine &gt; 0.9 mg proteinuria ) Epilepsy seizure disorder Any collagen disease ( lupus erythematosus , scleroderma , etc ) Active liver disease ( acute hepatitis , chronic active hepatitis , persistently abnormal liver enzyme ) Hematological disorder include alloimmune isoimmune thrombocytopenia exclude mild iron deficiency anemia Chronic pulmonary disease include asthma require regular use medication Heart disease Prior current thromboembolism . Antiphospholipid Syndrome . 7 . Prior history claustrophobia 8 . Metal implant 9 . Increased aneuploidy risk base ultrasound finding genetic test 10 . Intent deliver outside OHSU</criteria>
