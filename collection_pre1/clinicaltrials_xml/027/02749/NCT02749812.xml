	<brief_summary>The investigator propose multicentric control randomized trial whose goal evaluate possibility prediction efficiency APAP ( automatic continuous positive airway pressure ) constant CPAP ( constant positive airway pressure ) 800 severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) patient accord profile pressure variability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multicenter open randomize clinical trial involve 800 patient severe OSAS . After inclusion study , patient propose initiate CPAP home ( ResMed S9 PHILIPS PR1 ) use systematically APAP mode wide range pressure variation ( 4 20 cm H2O ) first 7day-period time . After first period treatment , analysis report release APAP order evaluate residual AHI , duration CPAP use amount leak order confirm CPAP efficiency observance . Pressure parameter ( efficient pressure variability ) collect . After randomization accord mode ventilation use ( APAP v constant CPAP ) , patient treat home 3 month . In constant CPAP group , efficient pressure determine P95 ( ResMed ) P90 ( PHILIPS ) recommend manufacturer , APAP group , patient treat within range pressure variation first 7 day-period . Clinical polygraphic evaluation do 3 month treatment , use combine criterion previously describe . In group , result consider accord efficient pressure value variability evaluate end first 7 day-period treatment</detailed_description>
