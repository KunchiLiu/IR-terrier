	<brief_summary>This phase II , open-label , 12-month pilot study 10 patient silent corticotroph pituitary tumor test hypothesis Pasireotide LAR ( long-acting release ) treatment patient silent corticotroph pituitary tumor elevate plasma Proopiomelanocortin ( POMC ) level reduce plasma POMC level associate reduction pituitary tumor size . Pasireotide LAR 40 mg administer monthly . Baseline monthly visit therapy monitor plasma level POMC , pituitary function , safety lab , glucose tolerance , physical examination , visual field . Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) do baseline , 6 month 12 month therapy . The eligible patient population consist adult patient know silent corticotroph pituitary tumor elevate plasma level POMC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinically non-functioning pituitary adenoma ( CNFAs ) , subtype pituitary adenoma appear secrete biologically active hormone characteristic clinical phenotype , common type pituitary macroadenoma diagnosis . There currently option medical therapy CNFA , general , specifically silent corticotroph tumor . Silent corticotroph tumor range completely asymptomatic become large cause significant hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction visual symptom , data support type tumor aggressive phenotype . Current therapy consist primarily surgical removal tumor recurrent residual tumor , repeat surgery and/or radiotherapy . In aggressive tumor , chemotherapy try success . Therefore , need exist medical therapeutic option treatment tumor type . This project assess clinical need .</detailed_description>

Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , unless use highly effective method contraception dose 3 month follow last dose pasireotide . Highly effective contraception method include : Total abstinence line prefer usual lifestyle subject . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception Female sterilization ( surgical bilateral oophorectomy without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week take study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment Male sterilization ( least 6 month prior screen ) . For female subject study vasectomized male partner sole partner subject Combination two follow ( a+b a+c , b+c ) : 1 . Use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception form hormonal contraception comparable efficacy ( failure rate &lt; 1 % ) , example hormone vaginal ring transdermal hormone contraception . 2 . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) 3 . Barrier method contraception : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository In case use oral contraception woman stable pill minimum 3 month take study treatment . Women consider postmenopausal child bear potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week ago . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider child bear potential .</criteria>
