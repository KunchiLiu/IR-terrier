	<brief_summary>This INTERVENTIONAL TRANSPLANTATION STUDY WITHOUT DRUGS . The INTERVENTION represent INFUSION DONOR T REGULATORY CELL-ENRICHED LYMPHOCYTES PATIENTS suffer REFRACTORY CHRONIC GVHD ALLOGENEIC HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION . The study include DOSE ESCALATION PHASE follow MTD PHASE detail follow chapter . The primary objective dose escalation study SAFETY , lead definition MTD T reg cell . For MTD study primary objective OVERALL RESPONSE RATE three month 3rd Treg infusion . The study single center single arm open label include DOSE ESCALATION phase follow EXTENDED PHASE MAXIMUM TOLERATED DOSE ( MTD ) . The aim study ass whether multiple infusion donor-derived purified T regulatory cell ( T reg DLI ) patient steroid-refractory chronic GVHD safe whether may induce clinical remission GVHD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multiple Donor Treg DLI Severe Refractory Chronic GVHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The procedure study infusion patient chronic GVHD purify Treg cell obtain original HSC donor ( T reg DLI ) . T reg cell PURIFIED utilize CliniMACS Plus Systems depletion CD8 CD19 positive cell enrichment CD25high expressing . Treg purification perform accord GMP procedure use clinical grade CLINI-MACS® device . The protocol detail chapter 3.5 The entire manufacturing process include cell harvesting , transport Treg purification validate . The feasibility selection nTreg human peripheral blood use CliniMACS® System previously document . In study , CD8+ CD19+ cell undetectable final blood product . Final content CD4+CD25+CD127lo-expressing cell mean 79 % ( range 52-82 % ) improve CD25 enrichment procedure . This protocol also validate two partner Centres Treg GENERATION CONSORTIUM , Liège Boston , result meet release criterion infusion . These purification procedure provide 0.98 2.93x10e6 Treg per kg . It noteworthy degree purity term CD4+CD25+CD127- cell range 72.80 % 93.90 % . According `` Reflection paper classification advance therapy medicinal therapy '' , publish Committee Advanced Therapies ( CAT ) European Medicine Agency June 20th 2014 [ EMA/CAT/600280/2010 Rev.1 line 118-131 ] Treg DLI SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED CELL THERAPY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS . Indeed somatic cell therapy medicinal product mean biological medicinal product fulfil BOTH follow two characteristic : ( ) contain consist cell tissue subject substantial manipulation biological characteristic , physiological function structural property relevant intend clinical use alter , cell tissue intend use essential function ( ) recipient donor ; ( b ) present property , use administer human being view treating , prevent diagnose disease pharmacological , immunological metabolic action cell tissue . For purpose point ( ) , manipulation list Annex I Regulation ( EC ) No 1394/2007 , include cutting , grind , shape , centrifugation , soak antibiotic antimicrobial solution , sterilization , irradiation , cell separation , concentration purification , filtering , lyophilization , freezing , cryopreservation , vitrification , shall consider substantial manipulation . The procedure list preparation purify T reg product DO NOT FULFILL definition substantial manipulation . Moreover , accord document [ line 286-306 ] T reg DLI SHOULD BE REGARDED administer HOMOLOGOUS USE . Indeed , outline `` Reflection paper classification advance therapy medicinal therapy '' cell harvest separated simple selection method , re-administered fulfil essential function generally regard homologous use . The essential function cell population mean cell remove original environment human body use maintain original function anatomical histological environment . Therefore INFUSION donor purify T reg cell TRANSPLANTED PATIENTS ( T reg DLI ) SHOULD consider TRANSPLANTATION rather administration ADVANCED THERAPY MEDICINAL PRODUCT . The aim study ass whether multiple infusion donor-derived purified T regulatory cell ( T reg DLI ) patient steroid-refractory chronic GVHD safe whether may induce clinical remission GVHD . Based observation pathophysiological involvement T regulatory cell chronic GVHD , adoptive transfer donor T regulatory cell appear reproducible effective vivo expansion follow administration drug . We determine feasibility , toxicity MTD ; assess clinical impact effect Treg Tcon homeostasis ; determine whether effect maintain extent persist . We also assess predictor response therapy , clinical ( e.g. , patient , disease , concurrent agent ) biological ( e.g. , degree Treg expansion ; Treg : Tcon ratio ; Treg function ) . As 1/1/2015 , current TRIAL PROPOSAL receive fund European Union Framework Program Research Innovation part project title `` Repair tissue organ damage refractory chronic graft versus host disease hematopoietic stem cell transplantation infusion purify allogeneic donor regulatoryT lymphocyte '' ( acronym TREGeneration , code 643776 ) . The project include set proposal different European institution ( University Lisbona , University Liege , University Regensburg University Bologna ) investigate role Treg DLI treatment chronic GVHD . The GRANT AGREEMENT sign EUROPEAN COMMISSION attach proposal .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Any patient undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation steroid refractory severe chronic GvHD either occur post transplant , induce donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) Tcell add back . The diagnosis chronic GvHD base NIH criterion , 2014 update . Chronic GvHD grade perform base updated NIH criterion . Severe chronic GVHD define SCORE 3 least one organ SCORE 23 lung . Refractoriness steroid define base follow criterion : ( 1 ) Performed already least two attempt treatment prednisone least 0.5 mg/kg 21 day previous 6 month ( 2 ) treat least another immunosuppressive medication 30 day previous 6 month ( 3 ) Requiring least 0.2 mg/kg prednisone maintain stable disease worsen despite 0.2 mg/kg prednisone . exclusion criterion : Inability obtain informed consent . Patients document active EBV , CMV fungal infection . Patients active HBV , HCV HIV infection . Patients diagnosis solid tumor within previous year exception NON melanoma skin cancer . Patients evidence Residual Disease last hematologic evaluation . Patients poor clinical condition ( ECOG 34 ) Female patient confirm pregnancy</criteria>
