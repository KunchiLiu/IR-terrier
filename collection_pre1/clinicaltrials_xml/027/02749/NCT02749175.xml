	<brief_summary>Cricoid force apply airway management prevent pulmonary aspiration regurgitate gastric content . This force usually apply nurse anaesthesia assistant . Currently perform WITHOUT monitor force apply determine individual 's `` educate hand '' derive his/her experience past training practice . Studies show actual force apply nurse anaesthesia assistant inconsistent deviate optimal force . Under application cricoid force result ineffective cricoid pressure risk pulmonary aspiration . Consequences pulmonary aspiration include lung injury infection , hypoxia , long Intensive Care Unit stay even death . Over exertion cricoid force result distortion larynx ( lead difficult bag mask , difficult tracheal tube insertion hypoxia ) . Preliminary result previous study ( IRB 2014/437/D ) , observation crossover pilot carry compare amount cricoid force apply 16 nurse manikin without direct feedback . Nurses instruct apply range force 30-44 Newtons mark site neck region manikin . A flexiforce load sensor use . Unblinded nurse perform significantly well feedback use load sensor blind nurse . With Funding National grant , real-time measurement cricoid force develop give feedback guide operator exert maintain TARGET cricoid pressure rapid sequence induction ( RSI ) . In study aim verify sensor system manikin compare force apply nurse sensor system without .</brief_summary>
