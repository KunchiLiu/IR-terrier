	<brief_title>Maintenance ANCA Vasculitis Remission Intermittent Rituximab Dosing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody ( ANCA ) vasculitis systemic autoimmune disease characterize small vessel inflammation cause pathogenic autoantibody direct proteinase 3 ( PR3 ) myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) . Immunosuppressive therapy result remission ; however , many patient relapse , result additional injury . Rituximab , humanize murine monoclonal antibody direct CD20 locate surface B-lymphocytes ( B cell ) , effective depleting B cell . The RAVE RITUXVAS trial show efficacy rituximab steroid induction remission ANCA vasculitis , similar cyclophosphamide steroid . Rituximab FDA-approved induction remission therapy ANCA vasculitis . The utility anti-B-cell therapy early induction remission ANCA vasculitis surprise give ANCA pathogenic vitro vivo . It clear remission many patient sustain single induction course rituximab , relapse often occur B cell re-population suggest schedule , serial dosing rituximab could result sustained remission . Despite yield promise outcome , rituximab also associate number adverse event include infectious complication late onset neutropenia5 , 15 . Furthermore , complication continuous B cell depletion extend duration unknown . One major goal field utilize prolong B cell depletion subpopulation patient risk disease relapse outweigh risk treatment-related adverse event . A rise ANCA titer reconstitution B cell promise biomarkers impend disease relapse follow treatment rituximab4-6 A prospective longitudinal clinical trial need determine ideal treatment strategy long-term maintenance remission . We propose compare intermittent rituximab dose base B cell return serologic ANCA flare The study design open-label , single center , randomize two-arm control trial evaluate optimal maintenance remission strategy provide best relapse-free survival patient ANCA vasculitis determine relapse-free remission 18 , 24 36 month enrollment . The investigator look enroll randomize 200 subject ANCA vasculitis rituximab-induced continuous B cell depletion minimum two year one two arm follow : 1 . Intermittent B cell depletion rituximab re-dosing upon B cell return : Subjects receive regularly-scheduled every-six-month dose rituximab instead receive rituximab 1000 mg IV x 2 dos ( space 2-3 week apart ) peripheral B cell return ( ≥ 10 B cells/mm3 ) . This cycle re-start . Subjects see clinic every three month . 2 . Hold continuous dose rituximab re-dosing upon significant ANCA titer increase : For MPO , significant increase define 5-fold rise ANCA titer level great 4 time cutoff value assay . For PR3 , significant rise define 4-fold rise ANCA titer level least twofold cutoff assay . Subjects receive regularly schedule every six-month dos rituximab instead monitor every three month . Subjects sustain significant increase ANCA titer receive rituximab 1000mg IV x 2 dos , ~2-3 week apart . If ANCA titer remain two-fold baseline specify threshold ( cutoff value assay PR3 4 time cutoff value MPO ) , subject continue receive rituximab 1000mg IV every 6 month maximum 2 dos , time new baseline ANCA titer establish cycle re-start .</detailed_description>
