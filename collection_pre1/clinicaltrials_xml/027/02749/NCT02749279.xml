	<brief_summary>The important drug evidence base lipid lower treatment ( LLT ) CHD statin . All patient establish CHD treat statin irrespective low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol ( LDL-C ) level . The goal treatment LDL-C 1.8 mmol/L ( 70 mg/dL ) 50 % LDL-C reduction target level reach . Unfortunately , several patient achieve treatment target also relate serious problem adherence therapy , include also LLT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lipid Lowering Therapy After Cardiac Rehabilitation LLT-R-Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In German rehabilitation clinic number patient clear indication LLT continuously high since year . Approximately 2,000 patient cardiac disease treat per year per clinic momentarily approximately three fourth indication LLT , mainly patient CHD . The main length stay German rehabilitation clinic 21 day , give chance necessity optimize LLT , since approximately 50 % patient indication LLT treatment target achieve . After patient give write informed consent , data collect . Here , relevant baseline parameter ( drug treatment , indication rehabilitation , clinical diagnosis , age , sex , BMI , echocardiographic parameter leave ventricular ejection fraction , laboratory parameter correspond record standard clinic , etc . ) record central database ( online-CRF ) . Furthermore , main topic interest study , LLT baseline , LLT rehabilitation phase , LLT treatment discharge include recommendation give home physician regard LLT discharge letter collect . Here , accord AHA/ACC Guideline ( 9 ) LLT stratify low-intensity statin therapy ( Simvastatin 10mg , Pravastatin 10-20mg , Lovastatin 20mg , Fluvastatin 20-40mg ) , moderate-intensity statin therapy ( Atorvastatin 10-20mg , Rosuvastatin 5-10mg , Simvastatin 20-40mg , Pravastatin 40-80mg , Lovastatin 40mg , Fluvastatin 80mg ) high-intensity statin therapy ( Atorvastatin 40-80mg , Rosuvastatin 20-40mg ) . Furthermore , data lipid lower drug cholesterol resorption inhibitor , fibrates PCSK-9 inhibitor collect . Adverse event related drug therapy collect submitted German health authority . Furthermore , serious adverse event ( SAE ) , drug manufacture Sanofi-Aventis , Zentiva Genzyme , submit Sanofi-Aventis . At discharge patient receive questionnaire , include question change drug treatment next 12 month . Here , patient record prospectively whether medication change , , change . After discharge patient contact mail three twelve month . Patients ask addition questionnaire discharge drug therapy special regard LLT Changes medication document comparison drug list discharge patient report drug , take time follow-up . Furthermore , general question drug therapy , re-hospitalizations especially connection atherosclerotic disease cardiac death , Re-PCI , Bypass , pulmonary embolism , TIA/ stroke , bleed , ACS/MI , others record . In disease registry endpoint record separately statistically analyze , however define AE record . Patients ask whether adverse event occur whether may relate drug therapy . If AEs relation drug therapy report information submit German health authority . SAE , drug manufacture Sanofi-Aventis , Zentiva Genzyme submit Sanofi-Aventis . Clinical research organization ( CRO ) carry - GCP-compliant data management : eCRF - creation include validation consistency check , input train regard manual ( auditor meeting ) , online delivery incl . license allocation support , patient registration , query management , data export biometrics . - GCP-compliant quality control ( Clinical Monitoring ) , setup process include monitoring , initiate inspection centrally ( auditor meet ) include total 22 on-site visit ( 2 / center ) . - Study preparation incl . review study document , submission ethic committee , support draft implementation , creation test folder `` Trial Master Files '' - Study Coordination care on-site file</detailed_description>
