	<detailed_description>The investigator enroll 120 human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) seronegative contact present sexually transmit infection ( STI ) clinic HIV test referral Chicago Center HIV Elimination ( CCHE ) network-based project , age 18 - 35 , study period 18 month refer University Chicago clinic outreach space perform HIV Partner Services well Expanded HIV test Linkage Care ( XTLC ) Chicago Department Public Health ( CDPH ) partner notification service South Side Chicago . Eligible participant undergo consent complete baseline assessment within 14 day eligibility . Subjects take baseline assessment include survey module describe detail ( demographic , substance use , mental health stigma ) . At baseline visit , investigator collect data demographic sex drug-using risk variable . From common electronic medical record clinic , investigator collect data participant ' care provider health care utilization . Subjects ask sign medical release form . Whenever possible , investigator select measure : ( 1 ) previously test HIV implementation study , particularly among young minority population ( 2 ) maximize comparability study . Randomization Following baseline assessment , study participant randomize one two group : Partner Services Pre-exposure Prophylaxis ( PS-PrEP ) intervention group standard care practice PrEPLine control condition . Study staff discus pro con , ethical basis assign participant different arm study , control intervention participant ( equipoise induction ) balance desirability two intervention condition . Block randomization use allocation ensure balance representation two treatment arm ( control intervention ) recruitment progress . The randomization assignment generate use R program . Once randomize , participant give study identification number allocate respective study condition begin trial . Due nature intervention , complete masking participant , investigator , interventionist possible . The research staff work directly linkage support group . To help mitigate possible bias interviewing , baseline data collection occur prior randomization . After randomization , intervention group take Session I intervention . This may take place day consent baseline visit , may schedule different time depend subject 's availability . 2 Week Visit ( Intervention Group ) The two week visit post baseline survey enhance linkage Pre-exposure Prophylaxis ( PrEP ) care . During two week visit interventionist participant engage Session II intervention : follow-up session promote PrEP linkage retention . During session , interventionist check-in participant in-person telephonically . This follow-up visit integrate Components 2 &amp; 3 intervention , mini-booster session best linkage practice , describe . 3 Month Visit During three-month visit control intervention arm come take survey . The survey compose entirely survey instrument take baseline survey , include capture attitude towards PrEP , HIV , risk behavior , self-perception risk . This survey allow research staff track change time intermittent assessment . 6 Month Visit ( Intervention Group ) Participants intervention arm contact six month schedule mini-booster session . At time , participant report significant barrier PrEP adherence , express desire engage ( re-engage ) linkage PrEP care schedule additional in-person intervention session . The purpose follow-up session ass ( re-assess ) success linkage PrEP care , address barrier PrEP adherence , refine participant ' `` linkage roadmap '' support future PrEP adherence . 12 Month Visit During twelve month visit control intervention arm come take survey . The survey compose entirely survey instrument take baseline survey , include capture attitude towards PrEP , HIV , risk behavior , self-perception risk . This survey allow research staff track change time intermittent assessment . Linkage Support Group Component 1 Face face intervention Session 1 The first main component PS-PrEP intervention consist intervention session study participant take approximately 65 minute . The structure content face face session theoretically empirically ground , review four primary content area : ( 1 ) provide information PrEP overview linkage care process ; ( 2 ) introduce participant cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) framework ; ( 3 ) use Motivational Interviewing technique build upon participant ' motivation reduce HIV risk ; ( 4 ) develop plan address barrier PrEP linkage development Linkage Roadmap . The conceptual framework guide session Information Motivation Behavior ( IMB ) model , design target client 's knowledge , personal social motivation engage linkage , self-efficacy objective ability ( i.e. , behavioral skill ) follow linkage PrEP care . In addition , session also provide client knowledge skill necessary target motivational readiness ( i.e. , stage change ) , expectancies self-efficacy get link care , thus , target determinant linkage care . The first area informational review PrEP general linkage PrEP care . PrEP knowledge adapt Center Disease Control ( CDC ) training module part Sustainable Health Center Implementation PrEP Pilot ( SHIPP ) project . Linkage best practice base upon linkage HIV care current practice within University Chicago , XTLC CDPH linkage care work group . The second area base CBT framework focus examine one 's relationship thought , feeling , behavior . CBT show effective intervention technique improve psychosocial outcomes well medical adherence variety setting . The third area Motivational Interviewing focus motivational process facilitate change within individual Motivational Interviewing fundamentally client-centered collaborative clinical approach , honor patient ' autonomy guide patient ' intrinsic motivation change . Finally , fourth component session , Linkage Roadmap , adapt intervention research Safren et al . utilizes CBT technique promote health medication adherence among people live HIV/AIDS . Through vehicle Linkage Roadmap , client interventionist collaboratively develop individualized PrEP linkage , adherence , retention plan . In process , interventionist lead client problem-solving activity identify address anticipate barrier PrEP linkage . This interactive activity target behavioral skill component IMB expectancies self-efficacy , utilized wide range HIV/AIDS-related intervention . Component 2 ( Weeks 1-12 ) Mini-Booster Sessions The booster session , outline final section Intervention Manual , conduct use method select subject include phone call , text messaging , private message social networking Facebook relatively short duration ( 5-6 minute ) . This second component complete tandem component 3 . The primary purpose booster `` check-in '' client experience get link care , answer question may respect , review Linkage Roadmap , problem solve experience difficulty enact Linkage Roadmap . The structured content booster session map directly onto component face face intervention session last 25 minute ( therefore four 5-6 minute structural content component ) . In experience , combination synchronous asynchronous communication effective pilot mini-boosters . A large body research indicate brief telephonic booster session ( synchronous communication ) offer supplemental support multi-component intervention similar propose PS-PrEP protocol associate increase sustained behavior change . The idea keep intervention content form salient provide participant individualized support utilize skill information impart face-to-face intervention . In total , investigator deliver 4 booster session . The first two booster session occur every week first two week second two booster monthly thereafter . Booster session continue client either link care ( complete 2 clinic visit ) three month linkage care window close . The flexibility booster session design tailor intervention participant may need high level support adhere Linkage Roadmap . All booster session begin accord procedure maintain confidentiality review interventionist baseline . Component 3 ( Weeks 1-12 ) Best linkage practice Throughout entire intervention period , research staff engage participant best linkage practice , introduce Module C Session I intervention , `` Linkage Roadmap , '' incorporate subsequent follow-up booster session . This component conduct tandem component 2 . Best linkage practice develop CDPH linkage work group adopt HIV Focus . The linkage include accompany participant first second PrEP clinical appointment . The research staff permit transport participant personal vehicle , however , provide transportation voucher need . The research staff accompany participant first two medical appointment , unless participant state want accompany . When clinic , research staff ask participant would like accompanied exam room . While wait first appointment , research staff clearly explain role clinic staff purpose additional clinic testing . The participant introduce new face information first appointment . The research staff continually clarify role ( ie . serve participant 's health care provider case manager ) question concern direct health care provider . During second appointment , research staff help facilitate provider effort engage participant , clarify address patient provider concern . The participant gently remind second appointment last appointment research staff attend . CONTROL CONDITION ( Low Threshold Prevention Group ) Control condition client test HIV negative clinic-based recruitment internal referral include brief risk assessment , ( occur prior consent subject study ) conduct University Chicago , CDPH clinic staff , referral additional STI test provision information regard HIV prevention programming ( include PrEP ) . Clients receive low threshold intervention PrEP Line , phone-based PrEP linkage intervention . The PrEPLine Linkage Care Specialist ( LTC ) establish contact client , facilitate initial interview provide PrEP education , collect necessary patient information build rapport . Once relevant information collect , participant interested eligible PrEP , LTC specialist collaboratively determine appropriate PrEP provider ( base location , insurance , patient preference ) offer schedule initial PrEP appointment . Once client engage PrEP care , routine care comprehensive adapt CDC 's Fenway Institute 's interim guidance clinician consider use PrEP ( update inject drug user ) . The University Chicago faculty clinician clinical PrEP site , University Chicago Access Grand Boulevard , also provide HIV primary care service include mental health service psychosocial support service . The initial visit eligible PrEP client primarily receive information PrEP undergo initial medical assessment , usually follow-up 2 week later . In contrast Ryan White HIV/AIDS Programming HIV infect client , formal intake visit case management follow-up affords much streamline process care provision . The referral STI test HIV prevention programming ( include PrEP ) disease intervention specialist staff , potential visit PrEP care provider include required mental health service occur first 2 week 3 month interval thereafter constitute treatment usual .</detailed_description>
