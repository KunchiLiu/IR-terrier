	<brief_summary>INTRODUCTION : The ability move transfer body effective manner , frequently affected people spinal cord injury negative impact mood quality life , way , achieve effective locomotion , one main objective rehabilitation program spinal cord injure patient . There different modality locomotion train spinal cord injury , robotic orthosis among , offer , positive outcome . However there´s still lack evidence optimal training characteristic , order establish best time , number session , progression scheme . For reason , establish effect different locomotion training program provide necessary data order develop effective training program maximum benefit patient . OBJECTIVE To determine effect different training program robotic gait orthosis patient chronic motor incomplete spinal cord injury ( SCI ) ( American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale ( AIS ) C / D ) short long term . METHODS AND DESIGN . The design study consist randomize , blind observer , clinical trial . Patients National Institute Rehabilitation ( INR ) spinal cord injury , AIS C D , least 6 month evolution , able walk without gait auxiliary , eligible . Informed consent obtain subject prior participation . Patients randomly assign either one two different train group : intervention control group . The control group submit training session 30 minute , intervention group train session 60 minute . Both group receive train period six week , five day week . Throughout train period , gait assessment GaitRite instrument , perform , repeat 6 12 month completion train part follow . The data obtain GaitRite compare within group , order determine type train effective Statistical analysis perform use SPSS , consider P &lt; 0.05 statistically significant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) disruption nerve pathway connect brain rest body , cause cessation motor , sensory vegetative function . It consider one devastate clinical condition affect functionality independence individual . The World Health Organization estimate annual overall incidence 40-80 new case per million , equivalent 250 000 500 000 individual spinal cord injury year . The consequence SCI , significantly impair ability patient perform daily life activity , overall quality life.Decreased mobility main element affect low satisfaction quality life . The improvement mobility ability move energy efficient manner improve quality life patient SCI . The recovery walk function consider great relevance patient physician . The relevant prognostic factor functional recovery SCI patient neurological status moment first examination , consider neurological level severity lesion accord American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale ( AIS ) . According Scivoletto , patient American Spinal Injury Association ( ASIA ) impairment scale A , thoracic lumbar lesion 6.4 % achieve functional walking . In patient ASIA B , overall rate ambulation 23.5 % , ASIA C 51.4 % ASIA D patient prognosis walk recovery 80-100 % ( 88.9 % ) . In another study , Dobkin [ 8 ] report 35 % individual classify AIS B , 92 % subject AIS C subject AIS D recover ability walk gait train intervention partial weight bear period 8 week . However , patient spinal cord injury , regain functional gait capacity , due low speed , decreased step length , cadence change rhythm coordination . In fact , spinal cord injury often lead change walk pattern , associate postural change relate poor ability transfer bodyweight , alteration balance equilibrium . Other important factor process walk recovery include : lack coordination development propulsion , sensory loss , hyperactive spinal reflex . These deficiency severe enough delay stand gait rehabilitation process . Some important gait abnormality individual suffer spinal cord injury : inability stand without assistance , voluntary movement joint hip hip , knee ankle , knee hyperextension , inability move leg without make compensation mechanism , foot dragging , change weight transfer walking , lack coordination , transition among phase gait , fall . That reason many gait training program evaluate . Current modality gait training , pretend activate locomotor center central pattern generator repetitive gait stimulus , allow central nervous system plasticity create new neural pathway connection spinal cord , make possible walking recovery patient spinal cord injury . Evidence favor two gait train modality : treadmill partial weight-support robotic-assisted gait . These train modality provide improvement gait parameter functionality compare conventional physiotherapy , show systematic review Morawietz Moffat different program gait train patient SCI AIS C D diverse etiology chronic acute evolution neurological level compare . Although use treadmill , partial weight-bearing robotic orthotics essential train locomotion SCI patient , little publish progress training , clinical decision make evaluation progress . [ 16 ] Most study subject provide general criterion optimize treatment ( modify body weight support speed training ) , provide insufficient evidence guide train progression parameter train frequency , speed optimal duration treatment . As result , important develop study test training strategy help clarify issue related amount , intensity , frequency , progression training order achieve maximum recovery gait individual SCI . Accordingly , determine compare effect different gait training program orient development effective training program . OBJECTIVE To determine effect gait different gait training program use robotic gait orthosis individual chronic incomplete SCI ( AIS C/D ) . Specific Objectives 1 . To evaluate change functionality gait spatiotemporal gait parameter , functional independence , low limb muscle force , spasticity joint range motion individual accord different progression program . 2 . To determine short term ( immediately posterior train program ) , medium term ( 6 month ) long term ( 1 year ) effect individual ' functionality gait , spatiotemporal gait parameter functional independence obtain different gait training program . 3 . To compare effect two different program gait train use robotic gait orthosis . METHODS 7.1.- Study Design : Randomized Clinical Trial blind observer . 7.2.- Subjects : Subjects inpatient outpatient service within Neurologic Rehabilitation Department National Institute Rehabilitation SCI AIS C D , least 6 month since injury able walk without walk aid . Sample Size Sample Size calculate base improvement gait velocity report previous publish study use program Epidat 4 . It calculate 23 patient require order detect difference mean 32.3 cm/s , report Wirz , standard deviation 37.5 cm/s , power 80 % confidence level 95 % On hand , Hornby report difference mean 0.36 m/s standard deviation 0.14 m/s , result sample size 4 subject per group . Due difference , initial trail perform initial sample size 4 subject per group new calculation power study make order determine convenience sample size necessity big sample . RANDOMIZATION The randomization conduct digital randomization system atmospheric noise , available random.org . Allocation do person include protocol . Proceeding The outpatient assist Spinal Cord Injury Service `` Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitación '' randomly assign two different groups.. The group define follow : A . Control group , 30 training session robotic orthosis duration 30 minute 6 week . B . Control group , 30 training session robotic orthosis duration 60 minute 6 week . Proposed statistical analysis Descriptive statistic carry measure central tendency quantitative variable proportion qualitative variable . In order analyze difference group , co variance analysis conduct . We consider result statistically significative p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
