The main treatment option complication operative revascularisation . Thus need new treatment modality diabetes patient PAD . Remote ischemic conditioning ( RIC ) non-invasive non-pharmacological treatment show attenuate tissue damage cause ischemia e.g . heart subject ischemia . RIC treatment consist brief repetitive period ischemia induce extremity e.g . arm . Recent finding show six week RIC treatment improve heal diabetic foot ulcer , suggest possible effect underlie pathological cause ulcer e.g . PAD . Hypothesis The investigator hypothesize RIC treatment improve marker inflammation , vascular neuronal function sense empowerment type 2 diabetes patient reduced peripheral blood supply .

	<detailed_description>Objective The drive objective study investigate long-term ambulatory remote ischemic conditioning improve symptom sign peripheral arterial disease sense empowerment patient type 2 diabetes . Background Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) vast challenge community diabetes patient . The prevalence PAD diabetes patient exceed non-diabetic individual estimate 26 % diabetes patient 65 year age 71 % patient 70 year . PAD major cause foot ulcer low extremity amputation , great socioeconomic implication . The main treatment option complication operative revascularisation diabetes patient associate increased rate complication mortality compare non-diabetes patient . Pharmacological treatment e.g . anti-platelet drug patient PAD show effect walk distance indorsed standard treatment . Thus need new treatment option diabetes patient PAD . Remote ischemic conditioning ( RIC ) non-invasive non-pharmacological treatment show attenuate tissue damage cause ischemia , reduce infarct size patient acute myocardial infarction , reduce organ damage patient undergo transplantation neuroprotective effect patient stroke . RIC treatment consist brief repetitive period ischemia induce extremity e.g . arm . It believe effect RIC mediate neuronal humoral pathway , however mechanism behind fully understood . RIC show beneficial effect attenuate platelet activation aggregation , improve endothelial function , improvement microcirculation , down-regulation neutrophil function , down-regulation inflammatory gene expression , improve mitochondrial function inducing change serum lipid composition One long-term RIC treatment study show twice daily RIC treatment 300 day feasible . The study show RIC could reduce recurrence stroke . No study presently investigate effect long-term RIC PAD diabetes patient ( Clinicaltrials.gov search 22nd October 2015 ) , concept however recently present literature . Two study address acute effect one RIC treatment walk distance non-diabetic patient claudication . The result inconclusive due small sample size , trend towards improvement show . It however likely long-term RIC treatment need show beneficial effect RIC pathology behind claudication - vascular neuronal damage . Hypothesis We hypothesize long-term RIC treatment improve PAD . PAD cause micro- macrovascular deficit . Reduced microvascular circulation lead distal nerve damage turn reduce peripheral circulation cause tissue degeneration . Reduced macro vascular function direct cause peripheral ischemia ( 2 ) . It possible RIC could attenuate pathophysiological process micro- microvasculature relate PAD abovementioned mechanism thereby improve neuronal vascular function . Thus present clinical evidence beneficial effect RIC may translate new safe simple non-invasive non-pharmacological treatment PAD diabetes patient , prevent progression critical ischemia amputation . We also hypothesize home-based self-administered RIC treatment improve sense empowerment patient non-critical peripheral arterial disease type 2 diabetes . Aims Methods Primary aim : study underlie mechanisms effect long-term ambulatory RIC investigate effect vascular function , neuronal function , marker inflammation , oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction lipidomic profile . Secondary aim study experience use RIC treatment focus barrier affect uptake RIC treatment , effect treatment life quality empowerment . Study design The study consist single-center randomise double blind placebo control trial . The trial perform investigate beneficial effect RIC treatment study outcomes describe . The RIC treatment duration 12 week 40 patient Steno Diabetes Center include trial . All test analysis perform Steno Diabetes Center expect marker inflammation oxidative stress perform Dept . inflammation , German Diabetes Center institute Clinical Diabetology , German Diabetes Center . All necessary facility available study site . Most present knowledge beneficial effect RIC list come short term trial ( duration = 1 day . 20 day one study ) small population ( n â‰¤ 40 ) . Thus plausible study setup yield significant difference outcomes study arm . The study may also indicate change outcomes occur post RIC treatment . For qualitative part study relevant questionnaire fill baseline end-of trial . In addition 15 random patient ask attend `` think-aloud '' interview within last 4 week treatment . Power calculation RIC show increase tissue oxygen tension ( measure microcirculation ) short-term study hypothesize RIC treatment increase tissue oxygen tension foot ( Primary outcome ) 13 % ( SD = 10 % ) . With 90 % power two side significance level 0.05 sample size need detect change 16 group - 32 participant total . Taking drop-out ratio 10 % account give inaccurate nature power calculation sample size study 20 patient group . Statistics The effect treatment outcome measure estimate use complete-case logistic regression analysis . If need outcome variable log-transformed use natural logarithm meet model assumption distribution model residual necessary . Interactions sex determinant investigated model investigate possible sex interaction difference . A level significance 5 % use . Analyses perform use SAS version 9.3 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . Discontinuation single person participation study cancellation whole study The doctor responsible study time discontinue study reason e.g . safety concern . The responsible doctor discontinue participation single participant inform consent withdrawn , participant want get pregnant get pregnant , participant follow study protocol . A participant withdraw participation without justification time influence treatment Steno Diabetes Center participant . Data storage All procedures facility data handle storage follow rule regulation Datatilsynet . Permission Datatilsynet collect store data seek prior study start . All data store Steno Diabetes Center , Niels Steensens Vej 4 , Gentofte , Denmark . No person sensitive data share collaborator outside Steno Diabetes Center . Data analyse do German Diabetes Institute handle use patient trail number . All data gather paper clinical examination store locked archive Steno Diabetes Center . Publication Data own Steno Diabetes Center A/S . Positive ( significant ) , negative ( non-significant ) inconclusive result publish soon scientifically justifiable . Significance perspective If project show effect RIC PAD next step test treatment method large trial walk distance primary outcome . Also possible patient foot ulcer patient critical peripheral ischemia could benefit treatment . RIC treatment could prove attractive non-pharmacological non-surgical treatment option large population diabetes patient . The trial result 5 publication efficacy RIC neuronal function , vascular function , lipidomic profile , marker inflammation oxidative stress ( Tentative title article list Appendix 3 ) patient empowerment quality life . The study recommend independent Professor Cardiology ( Appendix 4 ) . Possible limitation It debate whether diabetes attenuate efficacy RIC treatment . Data randomise clinical trial conflict . As patient present study population degree neuropathy may attenuate effect RIC outcome . However recent study show effect RIC diabetic foot ulcer contradict above-mentioned hypothesis , diabetes patient foot ulcer degree neuropathy .</detailed_description>
