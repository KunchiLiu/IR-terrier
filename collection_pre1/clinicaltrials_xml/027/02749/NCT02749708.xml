	<brief_title>Study IRX5183 Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research do learn safety effectiveness investigational drug , IRX5183 , treat acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . IRX5183 derivative Vitamin A. IRX5183 drug design cause cancer cell mature die . It think stop uncontrolled growth leukemia cell . These 2 part study . The purpose first part test safety IRX5183 different dose level . The investigator want find effect , good and/or bad , AML MDS . Once investigator figure best safest dose IRX5183 , investigator enter second part study use dose . The purpose second part see IRX5183 effective treatment AML MDS . To date , IRX5183 use 25 people . The first part study call `` Phase I '' study . Phase I study use drug start low dos slowly increase amount study drug give people side effect drug high give . This mean people study get dose IRX5183 . Doses begin study low dos end study . Because design study , people may get dos low effect , people probably get dos cause side effect . People AML , MDS , CMML 1 ) respond standard therapy 2 ) return previous response may join .</detailed_description>

Able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . 4 . Pathologically confirmed disease A B follow : A ) AML patient either : Relapsed refractory disease receive one course induction chemotherapy , hypomethylating agent therapy , bone marrow transplant de novo AML deem candidate conventional therapy base age , comorbidities , patient preference B ) MDS , CMML , MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPN ) high risk feature define relapsed initial response refractory ( failure achieve complete remission ( CR ) , partial remission ( PR ) , hematologic improvement ( HI ) ) receive least 4 cycle hypomethylating agent 5azacitidine decitabine ± therapy ± bone marrow transplant OR de novo MDS refuse receive hypomethylating therapy : Intermediate ( INT ) 2 high International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) score OR high high revise IPSS ( IPSSR ) Secondary MDS ( define MDS develop patient antecedent hematologic disorder patient prior chemotherapy radiation exposure ) INT1 IPSS intermediate IPSSR MDS excess blast ( ≥5 % blast bone marrow ) transfusiondependency MDS progress oligoblastic AML 2130 % bone marrow blast CMML MDS/MPN ≥ 5 % marrow blast , transfusiondependency , abnormal karyotype , proliferative feature ( white blood cell count ≥13,000/µL , splenomegaly physical examination , extramedullary disease ) 5 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 2 study entry Karnofsky &gt; 60 % . 6 . Laboratory test result within range : Creatinine level 3 mg/dL low , total bilirubin ≤ 3 mg/dL unless due Gilbert 's syndrome , hemolysis , ineffective hematopoiesis , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 3 x upper limit normal , white blood count ( WBC ) ≤ 10,000/µL 7 . Patients must receive treatment disease , include hematopoietic growth factor , aside hydroxyurea count control , within three week begin trial , recover toxicity prior therapy ( grade 0 1 ) . 8 . Patients require hydroxyurea bring WBC 10,000/µL prior study enrollment require 48hour washout prior start study drug . 9 . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 72 hour prior start IRX5183 . 10 . Patients must clinical evidence central nervous system ( CNS ) pulmonary leukostasis , disseminate intravascular coagulation , CNS leukemia . 1 . Any serious medical condition uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement prevent subject signing informed consent form . 2 . Any condition , include presence laboratory abnormality , place subject unacceptable risk he/she participate study confounds ability interpret data study . 3 . Use experimental drug therapy within 21 day baseline . 4 . Known hypersensitivity history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition IRX5183 . 5 . Prior use retinoid therapy 3 month prior enrollment study . 6 . Patients active cancer receive anticancer agent , exception hormonal therapy breast prostate cancer skin cancer treat local therapy . 7 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier ( e.g . alopecia , hypothyroid , neuropathy , etc. ) . 8 . Pregnant woman exclude study potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother IRX5183 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated IRX5183 .</criteria>
