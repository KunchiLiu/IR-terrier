	<brief_summary>The overall purpose research study identify disparity ischemia measurement fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) use cardiac catheterization laboratory myocardial perfusion stress- single-photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) . This study aim determine correlation simultaneous FFR SPECT obtain use regadenoson catheterization laboratory .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simultaneous Assessment FFR SPECT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients previously schedule diagnostic coronary angiography approach consent part study . If patient find one two vessel disease plan interventional cardiologist FFR use , previously consent patient deem appropriate study . The standard procedure follow FFR test use regadenoson . The patient receive standard dose Tc-99m sestamibi . The interventional cardiologist proceed percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) appropriate . Patients proceed cardiac catheterization laboratory hold area post procedure . Patients schedule take nuclear cardiology laboratory one three hour follow coronary angiogram standard SPECT acquisition . Patients monitor 2-6 hour overnight clinically indicate follow diagnostic coronary angiography PCI . Low dose rest myocardial perfusion scanning may perform next day stress myocardial perfusion study abnormal .</detailed_description>
