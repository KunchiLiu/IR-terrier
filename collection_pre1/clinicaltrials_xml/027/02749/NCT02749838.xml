	<detailed_description>The molecular understanding cancer advance rapidly , new generation effective , targeted cancer drug take center stage cancer care . Yet investigator system clinical test new agent keep pace revolution cancer biology . Stratification genotypic phenotypic abnormality divide histological cancer myriad clinically distinct subtypes . As cancer therapies become selective , intent treat population predictability patient presentation decrease , clinical trial enrollment become difficult traditional method . A breakout solution need clinical research methodology , create efficient mean develop new cancer drug US . Improved method systematic , prospective screening cancer patient need identify subset patient whose tumor express molecular marker target precision therapeutic . This protocol evaluate clinical sample cancer tissue identify molecular abnormality present individual patient ' cancer . In context investigator objective enable physician thoroughly characterize molecular abnormality underlie cancer connect eligible patient precision treatment part optimal care . By make trial accessible utilizing technology wisely , possible match cancer patient appropriate treatment , include clinical trial , within clinically relevant timeframe bring research opportunity consideration best clinical care .</detailed_description>
