	<brief_title>Does Frailty Help Predict Postoperative Outcomes Cardiac Surgery ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasingly , group patient undergo cardiac surgery older . Patients elderly frail know increase risk injury major organ follow surgery include heart , kidney , brain , associated bad survival diminish quality life . It become important able predict well patient fair cardiac surgery , include predict risk complication ( stroke heart attack ) well long-term survival quality life . Currently , score EUROscore use good effect predict survival major complication cardiac surgery patient . However , frailty - severity patient 's weakness fragility - emerge potential candidate predicting risk . Recent research show frailty score predict risk survival complication follow cardiac surgery suggest possibly superior pre-existing score . The investigator wish investigate possible link frailty outcomes follow cardiac surgery , addition current risk score . The investigator also wish determine whether frailty effectively predict longer-term outcome 'disability-free survival ' - patient-centred score measure ability patient lead normal life activity . Patients undergo major cardiac surgery King 's College Hospital recruit , follow consent . The study mainly involve questionnaire various stage , start pre-operative clinic . After surgery , follow patient 's progress carry 3 day hospital ; 1 month , 3 month , 6 month 1 year via telephone . The investigator expect result observational study influence research use frailty risk score prior clinical decision , add evidence assess risk-related outcome cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
