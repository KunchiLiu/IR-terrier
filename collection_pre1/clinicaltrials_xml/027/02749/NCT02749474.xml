	<detailed_description>Approximately 1:1000 pregnancy complicate cancer . Breast cancer common type diagnosed pregnancy . Termination pregnancy demonstrate improvement survival . Results international collaborative study report similar overall survival patient diagnose breast cancer pregnancy compare nonpregnant patient . The consensus medical opinion support option start treatment continuation pregnancy . The purpose Cancer Pregnancy Registry study prospectively follow woman diagnose cancer pregnancy-collecting information method diagnosis , treatment option maternal neonatal outcome delivery yearly follow . The majority fetal organogenesis complete 12 week pregnancy , consistent literature show increased malformation rate chemotherapy use first trimester pregnancy . The central nervous system continue develop throughout gestation birth . Whether chemotherapy give first trimester affect central nervous system maturity result developmental delays require study . The first author provide detail follow child expose chemotherapy utero Aviles Niz 1988 . At time 17 child range age 4-22 year born mother acute leukemia receive chemotherapy pregnancy examine physical health , growth development . Each child demonstrate normal growth development , school performance , intelligence testing , neurological examination , hematologic evaluation include bone marrow biopsy . This study expand twice . First 1991 , 43 child range age 3 19 year , also exposure utero chemotherapy maternal hematologic malignancy . All child normal physically neurologically . School performance standardize intelligence test significantly different control ( unrelated match child unexposed sibling ) . The author expand study final report 84 child 2001 , confirm previous report chemotherapy full dos aggressive hematological malignancy safely administer . Standardized test child expose chemotherapy repeat 11 year . Drs . Amant , et al report developmental outcomes 70 child Europe expose cancer treatment utero . The child developmental delay concentrate group deliver preterm . In study control group unexposed child . Cardonick also perform developmental test 57 child woman diagnose cancer pregnancy . Ninety-five percent child score within normal limit cognitive assessment ; 71 % 79 % child demonstrate age equivalency mathematics read score respectively . Tooth formation primary teeth begin 11 14 week fetal life complete postnatally . The enamel primary teeth begin develop 10 week gradually continue develop throughout pregnancy ; enamel development permanent teeth start week 28 begin mineralize time birth . It known tetracycline antiepileptic medication use pregnancy affect tooth development . For example , prenatal exposure tetracycline induces discoloration deciduous teeth , exposure antiepileptic drug increase risk enamel opacity hypoplasia . Enamel hypoplasia increase susceptibility primary dental caries due increase risk bacterial colonization . Peretz et al 2003 report dental examination 2 child expose Doxorubicin+/-Cyclophosphamide third trimester breast cancer . Both child 18 30 month age normal primary teeth . Three woman Cancer Pregnancy Registry report dental issue young child include develop primary teeth early childhood caries . The effect utero exposure chemotherapy amelogenesis require study . Women diagnose cancer type pregnancy enroll voluntarily Cancer Pregnancy Registry . Signed medical release form allow investigator review cancer diagnostic study treatment course . Records request yearly treat pediatrician dentist follow growth development child . All information keep confidential . Oncologic follow woman also request yearly .</detailed_description>
