	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Modified FOLFIRINOX Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer fourth lead cause cancer-related death worldwide . The 5-year survival rate overall patient le 6 % due late clinical manifestation systemic nature disease presentation . Even patient resectable disease , estimate 5-year survival rate resection 15 % 20 % . Traditionally , resection alone regard inadequate cure . Therefore , systemic and/or combine chemotherapy radiotherapy use preoperative postoperative therapy . Neoadjuvant treatment offer several theoretical advantage initial resection . Early delivery systemic therapy patient might lead high rate negative margin resection rate , enhance patient selection surgery . Although neoadjuvant treatment establish standard care resectable locally advanced disease breast , gastric , rectal cancer , role neoadjuvant treatment patient pancreatic cancer clear present . There global consensus management patient borderline resectable pancreatic cancer . If initially resect , postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy chemoradiotherapy standard . However , standard regimen neoadjuvant chemotherapy pancreatic cancer . Recent pivotal phase 2/3 trial demonstrate FOLFIRINOX improved response rate survival outcome patient metastatic pancreatic cancer compare gemcitabine . Because high response rate ( 30 % ) FOLFIRINOX , regimen widely investigate neoadjuvant setting . Therefore , investigator hypothesize neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX may enhance outcome patient borderline resectable pancreatic cancer . This study assess feasibility efficacy outcomes neoadjuvant modify FOLFIRINOX postoperative gemcitabine patient borderline resectable pancreatic cancer .</detailed_description>
