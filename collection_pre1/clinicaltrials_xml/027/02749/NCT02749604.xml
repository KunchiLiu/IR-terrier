	<detailed_description>I- Introduction : Benign prostatic enlargement one prevalent disorder age men may develop benign prostatic obstruction ( BPO ) cause significant effect quality life ( QoL ) . Clinical manifestation BPO include variety low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) classify void symptom storage symptom . Laser prostatectomy include two major technical principle ; enucleation adenoma surround capsule laser ablation adenoma . GreenLight laser ( 532-nm laser ) Holmium : Yttrium-Aluminum-Aarnet ( Ho : YAG ) laser ( 2100 nm ) commonly use nowadays . However , TURP remain gold standard modality treatment . Ejaculation one fundamental domains male sexual function . It well establish ejaculation disturbance , either anejaculation loss antegrade ejaculation , almost inevitable adverse effect prostate surgery especially TURP . A problem also associate prolonged use α-adrenoreceptros blocker . Such adverse event reason patient may choose avoid surgical treatment . This ejaculatory dysfunction attribute , accord current theory ejaculation , loss bladder neck function resection . However , many recent study demonstrate bladder neck closure may important role maintain antegrade ejaculation . Recent technique develop preserve ejaculation include ejaculatory hood sparing technique , prostatic urethral lift Rezum System ( convective water vapor energy ) . Ejaculatory hood define paracollicular supracollicular tissue present 1 cm proximal verumontanum . Hermabessiere et al . use dynamic transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) finding TURP demonstrate ejaculate directly expel infra-montanal urethra direct closure mechanism paracollicular supracollicular tissue without previous ballooning prostatic urethra . Various study publish highlight ejaculation preserve technique impact relieve LUTS . Alloussi et al . conduct ejaculatory preserve TURP ( epTURP ) total number 89 patient ejaculatory hood area preserve affected cut coagulation . Antegrade ejaculation preserve 90 % patient 3 month significant improvement LUTS 12.7 % case need second session bladder neck contracture 60 month . GreenLight laser PVP challenge TURP standard treatment low LUTS cause BPH many advantage e.g . short learn curve , short period postoperative bladder catheterization , low level retrograde ejaculation low index postoperative hematuria etc . Recently , introduction late generation GreenLight laser ( XPS ) , greenlight PVP use XPS system prove non inferior TURP reduce LUTS secondary BPH advantage laser . [ GOLIATH TRIAL ] . Tabatabaei S et al . describe ejaculation preserve PVP ( EP-PVP ) technique apply 160 patient present outcomes . Postoperative ejaculatory function evaluation show 56 % patient normal antegrade ejaculation , 30.6 % patient diminished ejaculation , 13.4 % patient suffered ejaculation . Post void residual urine ( PVR ) peak urinary flow rate ( Qmax ) show significant improvement . Overall , EP-PVP technique successful preserve ejaculatory function 86.6 % patient , without compromise LUTS outcomes . Most published similar study rely degree reduction International prostate symptom score ( IPSS ) , PSA , PVR uroflowmetry ass improvement LUTS follow ejaculatory preserve prostate surgery , without actual functional assessment degree deobstruction via urodynamic investigation . Pereira-Correia JA et al . conduct prospective urodynamic base trial compare TURP GreenLight laser PVP total number 20 patient 2 year . In study old generation GreenLight laser ( HPS ) utilize conventional PVP technique apply look urodynamic change Greenlight PVP TURP . They report high-power PVP achieve maintain result TURP period 24 month regard improvement infravesical obstruction evidence reduction mean micturition pressure bladder outlet obstruction index ( BOOI ) . GreenLight laser PVP currently gain wide acceptance emergence ejaculatory spar technique make feasible get benefit : relief LUTS preservation ejaculation . However evaluation actual infravesical deobstruction follow technique remain grey zone literature without objective assessment degree deobstruction . Furthermore , impact maintain ejaculation different domain sexual function use comprehensive assessment tool compare ejaculatory spar vs. non-ejaculatory sparring approach . II- Aim work In study , plan compare ejaculatory spar non-ejaculatory sparing ( conventional ) GreenLightTM Laser PVP use subjective objective assessment tool degree deobstruction . Furthermore , impact technique ejaculation secondary effect orgasm perception different domain sexual function thoroughly assess . III- Patients method III.1 . Study design : A randomized control clinical trial Trial registration : ClinicalTrials.gov ID : III.2 . Target population : In Prostate Unit , Mansoura urology nephrology center , sexually active patient present LUTS secondary BPO fail medical treatment schedule GreenLightTM Laser PVP . BPH surgical candidate patient present LUTS secondary BOO due BPH fail medical treatment IPSS score &gt; 15 Peak urinary flow rate Qmax &lt; 15 ml/min least 125 ml void volume . Legible subject fulfil inclusion criterion include randomized clinical trial ask sign inform consent form accord Good Clinical Practice Declaration Helsinki . III.3 . Patients ' allocation : Patients allocate 2 group . In 1st one , patient undergo regular non ejaculatory spar GreenLightTM Laser PVP ( Group I ) , 2nd group ( Group II ) ; ejaculatory sparing technique apply . Patients ask sign inform consent participation study . III.4.Methodology : II.4.a . Intervention All laser surgery perform supervised single surgeon large experience laser prostate surgery . Procedures perform patient general regional anesthesia . Normal saline use irrigant . The GreenLight ( 532 nm ) laser generator ( XPS ) use previously describe technique Group I . A side-to-side sweeping technique use side fire fiber move area bladder neck approximately level verumontanum . As much possible , end point laser procedure TURP-like cavity line capsular fiber , judge operator . For Group II , similar equipment use step PVP similarly perform . However procedure start mark ejaculatory hood ; paracollicular supracollicular tissue present almost 1 cm proximal verumontanum use Co-Ag mode laser ( 40W ) . The obstruct prostate tissue vaporize spar ejaculatory hood without vaporization coagulation mark hood area . III.4.b . Assessment tool : Ejaculatory domain Male sexual health questionnaire ( Ej-MSHQ ) 16 use detailed assessment impact procedure ejaculatory function subsequently impact report ejaculatory change orgasm perception . This domain entail seven question assess ejaculatory frequency , latency , volume , force , pain , pleasure , dry ejaculation . Each question score 1 5 ( best function ) outcome question consider significantly impaired equal 2 less . A total Ej-MSHQ score good ejaculatory function consider range 28-35 , average 22 27 ejaculatory dysfunction score less 22 . International index erectile function-15 ( IIEF-15 ) 5 ; five domain ( EF , orgasm , desire , intercourse satisfaction overall satisfaction ) assess degree change baseline last follow depict . EF domain 30 point score normal EF consider score 25 . Urinary outcome evaluation do use IPSS ( International prostate symptom score ) , QOL ( quality life ) , Q.max ( maximum flow rate ) PVR ( post void residual urine estimation ) . Urodynamic evaluation perform accordance standard recommend International Continence Society . IV . Follow : Patients evaluate baseline follow post procedure 2 week , one , four twelve month interval . In first second visit patient assess urinary function void parameter deem satisfactory , counseled resume sexual activity . Patients thoroughly evaluate subsequent visit urinary sexual outcome parameter ( 4 12 month ' visit ) V.1 . Randomization &amp; masking : The randomization process perform use computer-generated random table 1:1 ratio . Patients randomly assign study group day surgery , patient sign inform consent participation study . We randomly assign patient one treatment group mean stratified-blocked randomization across two stratum derive predetermined size grouping ( 30-55ml 55-80ml ) two stratum derive preoperative medication ( alpha blocker vs. non alpha blocker user ) . This method ensure parity among two treatment group . In stratum , give two possible block length two four respectively , random number generator give number uniformly distribute 0 1 , select block length two random number low 0.5 block length four otherwise . Variation block size prevent surgeon guess next treatment ; make difficult ( although impossible ) break treatment code . V.2 . Blinding : The surgeon know randomly assign laser procedure patient operate room . All patient , nurse perform urine flow studies/ address questionnaire , physician urodynamic study blind type procedure .</detailed_description>
