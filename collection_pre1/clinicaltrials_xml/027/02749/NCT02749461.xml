	<detailed_description>Preterm birth rate rise worldwide , include Europe . In 2014 , Switzerland 's rate premature birth reach 7.2 % . Still , significant progress neonatal care increase long-term survival preterm infant , long-term outcome remain problematic . As result , affect infant commonly undergo exceedingly high number painful procedure daily basis . For many , treatment intervention take place crucial period development nociceptive central nervous system , i.e. , developmental stage repeat painful stimulus may induce structural functional reorganization nervous system alter pain response . As infant unable communicate verbally , clinical pain assessment neonate , particularly deliver preterm , highly challenge . Therefore , pain response observe accord physiological behavioral indicator might vary across preterm infant depend physiological neurological development stage . The Bernese Pain Scale Neonates ( BPSN ) multidimensional pain assessment tool already widely use clinical setting German speak area Europe . Recent finding suggest pain reaction influence noxious stimulation alone : assumed contextual factor , e.g. , gestational age ( GA ) gender , might also impact pain reactivity . The aims validation study : - undertake psychometric test BPSN regard concurrent validity Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised ( PIPP-R ) , construct validity , interrater intrarater reliability , specificity sensitivity ; - examine variability pain reaction related behavioural physiological pattern across time ; - ass influence contextual factor variability pain reaction across GA group ; - examine relationship behavioural physiological indicator across time . This multisite psychometric measurement study BPSN use repeat measure design . The study take place three tertiary care hospital ( Bern , Zurich Basel ) Switzerland . To examine impact GA pain reaction variability , infant stratify six GA group range 24 0/7 42 0/7 . Among preterm infant GAs 36 6/7 week , five consecutive heel stick within first 14 day life document . Among healthy-term infant two heel stick within first day birth document . For heel stick , measurement record three phase : baseline , heel stick , recovery . All phase videotape child 's pain reaction later rat accord BPSN five independent raters blind measurement phase . Individual contextual factor interest study document standardised way three participate Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICUs ) , extract patient chart . This diagnostic study intend validate BPSN consideration contextual factor influence neonatal pain response . Understanding embed influence contextual factor final version BPSN-Context help clinician accurately assess pain clinical setting , eventually help minimize pain endured neonate , particularly preterm neonate NICUs . For preterm infant require intensive care , adequate efficient pain management important factor later motor cognitive development . The investigator hope study contribute prevention negative long-term outcome patient population .</detailed_description>
