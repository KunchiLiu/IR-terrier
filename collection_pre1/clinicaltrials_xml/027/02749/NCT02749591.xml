	<brief_title>Comparative Hybrid Effects Combining BoNT-A With Robot-assisted Mirror Therapy U/E Spasticity Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose project examine compare immediate long-term effect combine Botulinum toxin type A injection mirror therapy ( MT ) bilateral robot-assisted ( RT ) patient spastic hemiplegic stroke . Spasticity , common impairment stroke , profound impact activity participation patient . BoNT-A injection combine rehabilitation training recommend enhance functional recovery stroke patient spasticity . Although positive combination effect BoNT-A stretch , RT , constraint-induced movement therapy report , quality evidence weak due methodology limitation . In addition , patient spasticity usually low motor function bad sensory deficit patient without spasticity . Designing post BoNT-A injection rehabilitation program consider issue . RT MT two intervention provide sensorimotor input patient low level motor function . It unknown whether combine BoNT-A injection RT MT positive effect engenders differential effect motor related functional performance . At least 60 participant chronic spastic hemiplegic stroke recruit randomly assign one 3 group : BoNT-A injection RT , BoNT-A injection MT , BoNT-A injection control intervention ( CI ) . All post-injection intervention implement 60 minutes/day , 3 days/week , 8 week . The RT group receive 30-minute RT , follow 30-minute functional training . The MT group receive 30-minute MT , follow 30-minute functional training . The CI group receive 60-minute rehabilitation program , bilateral arm training functional task practice . Body function structure outcome measure include Fugl-Meyer Assessment , Modified Ashworth Scale , Medical Research Council scale , myometer ( Myoton-3 ) , actigraph , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index . Activity participation measure include Wolf Motor Function Test , Ten meter walk test , Motor Activity Log , Nottingham Extended Activities Daily Living Scale , Canadian Occupational Performance Measure . In addition , directly reflect patient 's unique need goal , Goal Attainment Scaling assess . Evaluators blind group allocation . The outcome measure pre-treatment , post-treatment , 3-month follow-up . This comparative efficacy study first examine compare immediate long-term combination effect BoNT injection RT , MT , CI . The follow-up assessment provide long-term effect different treatment health-related outcome , crucial community reentry . In addition , result objective assessment patient-reported outcome may lead individualized upper limb training follow BoNT-A injection patient spastic hemiplegic stroke .</detailed_description>
