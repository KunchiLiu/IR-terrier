	<detailed_description>rTMS treatment involve stimulate certain area brain magnetic field pulse . Over time , magnetic field pulse gradually change activity level stimulate brain region help symptoms bipolar depression . The device use study approve Health Canada therapeutic use since 2002 . Participants complete screen visit determine eligibility base inclusion/exclusion criterion . If participant eligible , study procedure conduct . Eligible subject randomize receive either active iTBS-rTMS sham rTMS treatment ( scalp stimulation magnetic pulse ) daily four week ( 20 session ) leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) . All participant complete MRI ( target leave DLPFC region brain functional activity ) , EEG &amp; fNIRS , lab work , neurocognitive test prior commencement post rTMS treatment . Efficacy , safety tolerability evaluate screen visit , daily rTMS treatment , clinic visit post rTMS treatment . All participant phone interview two week post rTMS treatment .</detailed_description>
