	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine potential Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) -specific breath signature non-invasive screening tool identify PD patient inflammation , track progression disease , responsiveness various therapeutic intervention , particular anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory therapy . Neurological disorder include disorder involve brain nervous system , example memory disorder , stroke , movement disorder many condition . The study lay foundation future study breath fingerprinting could use screen technique . Investigators also look breath fingerprint correlate inflammatory protein blood . Investigators determine molecule human breath define `` breath signature '' associate neurological disorder like Parkinson 's disease . The long-term goal study use blood inflammatory marker relationship Breath Analytical Approach identify individual risk development neurologic disorder monitor effect immune intervention rate disease progression . The study team recruit total 100 participant : 50 early stage ( define Hohn &amp; Yahr Stages 1-2 ) , non-smoking Parkinson 's Disease patient among Emory Movement Disorders Clinic 50 age sex-matched healthy control ( HC ) . Investigators recruit six eight participant per month 18-month time period .</detailed_description>
