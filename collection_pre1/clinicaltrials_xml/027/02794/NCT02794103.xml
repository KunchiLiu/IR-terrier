	<brief_summary>Procedural pain intense often undertreated pain associate burn injury . The use analgesic always provide optimal relief accompany several side effect .

	<brief_title>Virtual Reality Distraction Procedural Pain Management Anxiety Children With Burn Injuries : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND 1.1 The burden burn pain . Burn injuries among lead cause visit emergency department hospitalization young child . They mostly result scald contact household appliance . Regardless cause injury , dress change hydrotherapy session burn injury associate extreme pain . The management acute pain experience hydrotherapy session patient burn injury , call procedural pain , remain major challenge healthcare professional . Pain several short term effect child development , mood , sleep , appetite , school performance , anxiety distress level . In long term , decrease pain threshold , cause stress disorder , affect social behavior seek medical service . In burn injury , pain often accompany great anxiety , turn , decrease pain tolerance . To relieve pain anxiety , clinician usually rely pharmacological agent via administration high dos opioids anxiolytic . The use medication cause deep sedation child , many side effect nausea , vomit , respiratory depression . Also , despite grow use opioids , patient report pain 7 scale 0-10 dressing change hydrotherapy session . Multimodal approach combine medication non-pharmacological intervention explore reduce pain anxiety associate painful procedure . 1.2 . Innovation non-pharmacological pain intervention . Studies review highlight , recent year , effectiveness multimodal approach combine medication non-pharmacological intervention procedural pain relief . Distraction technique recognize among effective non-pharmacological intervention . They divert child 's attention attractive element , hinder perception painful stimulus therefore reduce pain anxiety . Distraction base gate control theory Melzack Wall state link perception pain level attention devote stimulus affect painful experience . Therefore , distraction technique engage multiple sens vision audition may grab child ` attention technique engage one sense . Hence , increase interest immersive interactive method distraction virtual reality ( VR ) management procedural pain . 1.3 Virtual reality distraction . This active distraction method allow user interact immersive environment generate computer stimulate different sens ( vision , hear sometimes touch ) . VR allow mental escape multisensory interaction . Its effect know decrease pain anxiety . In past ten year , VR test different study older child adult burn victim . A study Hoffman et al . 2007 , show percentage reduction pain VR comparable reduction result moderate dose hydromorphone equivalent patient would receive burn wound care . Yet , author state believe best analgesia achieve combine VR pharmacological treatment . However , study test effect combination pharmacological virtual reality intervention , procedural pain anxiety young child suffer burn injury . Also , current study VR mostly use 3D goggles helmet contact close face child could challenge young child since mostly burn face upper trunk . Therefore , new VR prototype develop collaboration Society Arts Technology ( SAT ) Montreal provide immersive interactive experience burn child hydrotherapy tank . The prototype develop several meeting researcher , designer engineer surgical-trauma team CHU St. Justine . Meetings follow ergonomic study hydrotherapy room meet unit 's patient ' specification ensure n't interfere healthcare professional work . 2 . AIM The aim pilot study assess feasibility applicability prototype well satisfaction healthcare professional regard use VR prototype relief procedural pain anxiety young child burn injury . Primary Research Question : In child 2 month 10 year old suffer burn injury , VR distraction feasible , applicable satisfactory method pain relief hydrotherapy ? Secondary Research Question : In child 2 month 10 year old suffer burn injury , VR distraction provide good pain anxiety relief hydrotherapy standard pharmacological treatment ? 3 . HYPOTHESES 1 . VR distraction feasible acceptable non-pharmacological method procedural pain relief ( hydrotherapy ) young child burn injury . 2 . VR distraction combine analgesic efficacious standard treatment ( analgesic alone ) procedural pain anxiety ( hydrotherapy ) young child burn injury . 4 . METHODS 4.1 Design . Single-arm pilot study . 4.2 Sample Setting . Participants recruit convenience sample upon admission surgical-trauma burn unit . The unit hydrotherapy room inpatient outpatient . Healthcare professional usually present hydrotherapy : burn wound care nurse , nurse clinician pain clinic , anesthetist , physical therapist orderly . The size total desire sample 15 20 participant depend recruitment rate since pilot study . The study take place hydrotherapy room CHU St. Justine , large pediatric university teach hospital Montreal VR prototype instal . 4.3 . Measures . Measures baseline pain anxiety record T1 , 30 minute procedure , patient ` room . Measures procedural pain , anxiety sedation level take : T2 , procedure , upon arrival hydrotherapy room , T3 , procedure ( 10 min begin hydrotherapy session ) , T4 , immediately procedure leave hydrotherapy room T5 , 30 minute procedure patient ` room . The patient ` comfort level also assessed procedure T3 . Finally , acceptability intervention assess questionnaire comprise item acceptability satisfaction healthcare professional T4 . The measure record participant three hydrotherapy session . The primary outcome acceptability intervention . Comparisons make pain anxiety level order session . 4.4 Data analysis plan . Descriptive statistic perform sociodemographic clinical variable , comfort level satisfaction health professional . Analysis variance ( ANOVA ) use compare mean difference pain score , procedure well anxiety level sedation . Since use rescue medication potential indication treatment failure , analysis supplement analysis compare proportion patient receive rescue medication anytime procedure . Interpretation analysis make reference data regard rescue medication use . Data collect dichotomous variable analyze use chi-square test post-hoc analysis result statistically significant . 5 . FEASIBILITY The setting study main referral center pediatric burn Quebec . It receive nearly 60 admission period high incidence burn ( April October ) almost 100 admission per year . The investigator able access population study give PI 's affiliation research center set . Moreover , stakeholder pain clinic surgical-trauma unit aware study , participate stage prototype development . 6 . POSSIBLE PITFALLS AND SOLUTIONS It unknown whether VR feasible distraction technique young children/infants age 2 month 2 year old . The pilot study help inform investigator visual track infant painful medical procedure . Upon completion pilot study , decide whether include young population large trial . 7 . CONTRIBUTION AND EXPECTED RESULTS Despite grow interest field , procedural pain management child remain suboptimal importance develop effective method require . This project provide preliminary evidence feasibility , acceptability , preliminary efficacy non-pharmacological method procedural pain management development test innovative intervention . VR distraction could interest method relieve pain , easy use without known side effect . The investigator hope could reduce need opioids anxiolytic burn child decrease pain related procedure provide less traumatizing hospital experience , often first child 5 year old . The expected result direct effect physical ( pain , comfort ) psychological ( anxiety ) health child . In addition , clinical implication may include indicator quality care economic benefit duration hydrotherapy session , amount opioids anxiety drug administer , use coanalgesics , number professional require hydrotherapy room duration wound healing .</detailed_description>
