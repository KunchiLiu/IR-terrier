	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NPC endemic Southern China include Hong Kong . Despite aggressive definitive chemoradiotherapy locoregionally advanced disease , still 30 % develop relapse locoregionally distally . Salvage second-course radical radiotherapy without chemotherapy may achieve durable disease control locoregionally advanced recurrent disease . However receive 2 course radical radiotherapy distant metastasis , systemic chemotherapy would drug choice . Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy include cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil , capecitabine , gemcitabine taxane consider standard first-line treatment . For second-line treatment , whether platinum-based chemotherapy give previously consideration . Re-challenge cisplatin 5-fluorouracil consider patient enjoy good initial response regimen intervene disease-free period 1 year.However far recognize standard third-line systemic treatment . Metronomic oral chemotherapy may provide ideal choice patient treat set shift target tumor cell tumor vasculature reduce chance drug resistance well offer relatively low toxicity profile significantly jeopardize long-term complication bring prior course radiation therapy , surgery chemotherapy . In view , investigate metronomic open-label oral cyclophosphamide third-line treatment beyond patient inoperable locoregionally advanced recurrent metastatic NPC fail least 2 line prior systemic chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
