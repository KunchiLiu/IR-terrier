	<brief_summary>The investigator examine whether compulsivity score above-average ( clinical cut-off ) eat disorder questionnaire alter 9 day N-acetyl cysteine ( NAC ) . N-acetyl cysteine show benefit individual compulsive disorder , trichotillomania addiction , research investigate whether short period time take N-acetyl cysteine change compulsivity , measure use cognitive task questionnaire .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anorexia nervosa psychiatric disorder high mortality rate little evidence pharmacological intervention value . The picture similar bulimia nervosa , high mortality rate mixed outcome study test Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors ( SSRIs ) . It possible conceptualise eat disorder akin compulsive disorder , especially note repetitive weighing , calorie count compulsive exercise compensatory mechanism might fit hypothetic obsessive-compulsive spectrum ( OC spectrum ) . Some disorder OC spectrum associate oxidative stress . This may also true eat disorder : recently find meta-analysis evidence increase oxidative stress marker AN . Glutathione main cellular anti-oxidant mammal possible increase glutathione level ( thus potentially combat oxidative stress ) dietary supplement call N-Acetyl Cysteine ( NAC ) . NAC acetylate form naturally occur amino acid cysteine , convert cysteine body . Cysteine key precursor glutathione . Oral administration cysteine increase brain glutathione level cysteine poorly absorb gastro-intestinal tract . However NAC bioavailable thus administration increase glutathione brain . Using NAC increase glutathione level show beneficial compulsive disorder addiction , Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) relate disorder trichotillomania preliminary study . There positive indication use evidence pathological gambling , trichotillomania , OCD cocaine addiction . However , NAC knowledge ever consider treatment eat disorder . This research therefore aim investigate whether increase glutathione reduce neuropsychological marker compulsivity group risk eat disorder . The researcher choose use female non-patient group think highly compulsive , also without possible confounds medication ( OCD addiction disorder ) without malnutrition ( clinical eating disorder ) . Those recruited female , evidence may different risk factor thus mechanisms underlie development eat disorder male female , recruit might produce confound . The investigator also choose use short duration NAC administration . This allow use cross-over design without fear high attrition rate non-compliance , also allow detection subtle early change compulsivity . The hypothesis thus improvement see task measure compulsivity , also potentially tasks measure relate construct impulsivity , habit-based learning , delay discounting . The researcher expect improvement self-report symptom questionnaire . However , possible future study would randomize clinical trial look increase glutathione clinical group time affect clinical symptomatology . The questionnaire choose identify eat disorder symptom level ( Eating Attitudes Test - 26 ( EAT-26 ) validate way ) look compulsive starvation use self-starvation scale ( Godier &amp; Park 2015 ) . The Structured Clinical Interview Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders-IV ( SCID ) use rule current Axis I diagnosis include eat disorder , prevent complication starvation medication initial pilot study . The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire ( EPQ ) use ascertain personality trait , National Adult Reading Test ( NART ) use estimate Intelligence Quotient ( IQ ) . The rationale choosing task base hypothesis compulsivity may improve increase glutathione level . Thus , task choose design pick difference different facet compulsivity . The Wisconsin Card Sorting Task ( WCST ) able quantitatively measure set shifting , know impaired eating disorder ( Roberts et al . 2007 ) facet compulsivity . The Affective Go/No go pick attention bias within umbrella compulsivity ; Attention Switching task pick ability switch attention different task demand , within compulsivity umbrella . The Cambridge Gambling Task good measure disadvantageous decision making within umbrella impulsivity ( think orthogonally relate , rather opposite , compulsivity ) ( Fineberg et al . 2014 ) . The sequential learning task use OCD , able disentangle goal-directed learn habitual learning base two computational algorithm . The hypothesis compulsivity relate disturbance goal-directed learning , habit learning prefer leading rigid behaviour ( Gillan &amp; Robbins 2014 ) ( Voon et al . 2015 ) . Thus useful see goal-directed less habit learning occur increase glutathione level . The delay discount task measure ability ignore delay time consider reward value , relevant eating disorder often delay discount reduce performance well ( Steinglass et al . 2012 ) . This interesting interaction impulsivity seem almost opposite , yet anorexic patient show good performance . Thus task might useful exploratory measure . The Facial Expression Recognition Task ( FERT ) sensitive early change emotional bias small pharmacological change , profile individual high eat disorder symptom different task compare healthy control ( Jones et al . 2008 ) - operate positive control identify increase glutathione effect general emotional bias , even compulsivity . Because aim study see whether NAC may lower compulsivity increase glutathione level , researcher take small venous blood sample ( 5mls ) saliva sample prior test arm study check extent NAC treatment elevate glutathione level placebo . Participants wish give blood exclude ask provide saliva sample . Blood saliva render acellular centrifugation store assay University Departments Chemistry Pharmacology . Once assayed remain sample discard accord Standard Operating Procedures sample disposal .</detailed_description>
