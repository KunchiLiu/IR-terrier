	<brief_summary>After initial ankle sprain , Chronic Ankle Instability one common residual symptom include pain , swell , recurrent sprain , episodes ankle joint `` give away '' decrease function . Recently , Whole Body Vibration ( WBV ) training introduce preventive rehabilitative tool . It hypothesize WBV unstable surface might enhance neuromuscular control . Therefore , aim study investigate effect 6-week WBV training unstable surface body composition , balance , strength reflex muscle activity ankle muscle recreational athlete CAI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Whole Body Vibration Training Unstable Surface</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants : Fifty physically active recreational athlete self-reported CAI volunteer participate study . These subject assign one three group : Vibration group ( VIB ) , Non-Vibration group ( N-VIB ) Control group ( CON ) . Each participant inform risk discomfort associate investigation sign informed consent document onset experiment . The experimental protocol approve Ethics Committee Clinical Research Hospital Complex Toledo ( Spain ) . Procedures : The investigator perform randomized clinical trial cross design . Participants assess three time point : pre-training ( Pre ) , post-training 1 ( Post1 ) post-training 2 ( Post2 ) ( 6 week last training session ) . Measurements consist body composition analysis , two balance test , force ankle inversion test isokinetic strength test . Assessors researcher perform statistical analysis blind group allocation . Measurements train protocol develop Performance Sport Rehabilitation Laboratory University Castilla-La Mancha ( Toledo , Spain ) . Training protocol : Participants follow balance training protocol six week unstable ankle . Exercises session perform three day week ( 48 hour session ) BOSU® Balance Trainer . All exercise carry unstable ankle experimental group . Participants N-VIB group train BOSU® floor , whereas participant VIB group train BOSU® Fitvibe Excel Pro vibration platform ( Fitvibe , Bilzen , Belgium ) . The Training programme consist three series 4 exercise 45 second 45 second rest exercise . Following recommendation previous research study18 , level difficulty increase exercise three week . Also , frequency progressively increase every two week . Biodex Balance System test : Ankle balance assess Biodex Stability System ( Biodex Medical Systems , Shirley , New York , USA ) . The balance test consist mobile platform , allow 20° surface tilt 360° range motion . The platform , interfaced computer software ( Biodex , Version 1.32 , Biodex Medical System ) , generate three stability index : Overall , represent platform displacement direction ; Anterior/Posterior Medial/Lateral . The test perform level 8 participant barefoot single-leg stance . Participants ask step platform eye open assume comfortable position maintain slight flexion knee ( 15° ) , look straight ahead monitor place hand hip . Foot position coordinate register ensure position use test . Star Excursion Balance Test ( SEBT ) : The SEBT , perform participant stand barefoot middle grid form eight tape measure extend 45° , label accord direction excursion relation stand leg . Participants ask maintain single-stance reach contralateral leg touch lightly far possible along chosen direction distal part foot return bilateral stance . A standardised protocol 4 practice trial follow 3 test trial perform eight direction minimize learn effect . Reach distance measure researcher make mark tape measure . The average three test trial normalise leg length stance leg use analysis . Body composition : Height measure use wall-mounted stadiometer ( model 220 , Seca , Hamburg , Germany ) . Body weight ( underwear ) measure digital balance ( model 707 , Seca , Hamburg , Germany ; weigh accuracy 0.1 kg ) . Total regional body composition measure dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( Lunar iDXA ; GE-Healthcare , Fairfield , CT , USA ) use standardize protocol specify manufacturer . Lean mass , fat mass , % fat , bone mineral content bone mineral density total body leg ankle instability obtain use enCORE software ( GE Healthcare , v. 13.40 ) . Inversion test : Electromyographic ( EMG ) measurements take peroneus longus ( PL ) , peroneus brevis ( PB ) tibialis anterior ( TA ) . The test perform custom-designed ankle inversion platform capable produce 30⁰ inversion , previously use research . The start end inversion mark double axis goniometer ( SG110/A , Biometrics Ltd , Gwent , UK ) attach platform door detect change angle door . Muscular activity record use portable eight channel telemetry data logger ( ME6000-T8 , Mega Electronics , Kuopio , Finland ) analyse use MegaWin 3.1-b10 software ( Mega Electronics , Kuopio , Finland ) . Isokinetic test : Ankle evertor muscle test Biodex Multi-Joint System 3 dynamometer ( Biodex Medical System , New York , USA ) three different velocity : 60 , 180 300 degree per second eccentric concentric contraction . The isokinetic test carry two different day . The first day , participant familiarize test procedure position dynamometer participant register ensure test carry always condition . Measurements take second day . Data analysis : Statistical analysis perform use IBM SPSS Statistics v.22.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , Illinois , USA ) . The level significance set p &lt; 0.05 . The normality variable initially test Shapiro-Wilk test . All variable present normal distribution . A 2-way repeated measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) perform outcome variable analyze interaction group ( VIB , N-VIB , CON ) time assessment ( pre-training , post-training 1 , post-training 2 ) . The Bonferroni multiple comparison test perform account multiple comparison . The effect size calculate pairwise comparison . The magnitude effect size interpret use Cohen 's scale . All data present mean standard deviation .</detailed_description>
