	<detailed_description>Inflammatory non-lactating breast diseases encompasses large spectrum disease range infective disease autoimmune disease , cause considerable morbidity difficulty diagnosis . In daily practice , exclusion possible diagnosis breast carcinoma important step . Aetiological factor non-lactational mastitis include bacterial infection , tuberculosis , auto-immune disorder , etc . Treatments patient include antibiotic , anti-tuberculosis therapy , corticosteroid treatment . Many patient pathologically diagnose periductal mastitis ( PD ) idiopathic granulomatous mastitis ( IGM ) . The current treatment PD IGM include corticosteroid treatment , antibiotic surgical treatment . Based literature review , complete response ( CR ) rate corticosteroid surgical treatment range 63-87 % 89-100 % , respectively . Time CR range 2-8 month corticosteroid treatment . Pathological finding patient IGM PD reveal infiltrate inflammatory cell neutrophilic microabscesses around lobular unit partial ductal obstruction , hypothesize ductal lavage therapy able relieve symptom dilate lactiferous duct follow irrigation solution flushing , short recovery time satisfactory CR rate . In institution ( Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital , Guangzhou , Guangdong , P.R.China ) , routine practice perform ductal lavage therapy patient non-lactating breast disease , especially patient IGM PD , start corticosteroid antibiotic treatment . For patient evidence bacterial infection , antibiotic add irrigation solution . In experience , many patient short recovery time low relapse rate , spar use corticosteroid antibiotic treatment . However , concrete data quantify efficacy ductal lavage therapy IGM PD patient . This observational study aim prospectively enroll eligible patient investigate efficacy ducal lavage therapy IGM PD patient .</detailed_description>
