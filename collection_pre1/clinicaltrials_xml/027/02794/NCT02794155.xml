	<brief_summary>This Phase 2b , multicenter , randomize , double blind , titration clinical study , evaluate efficacy safety HDV Insulin Lispro Group versus Insulin Lispro Group patient type 1 diabetes 26 week treatment period . The patient randomize use centrally allocate randomization scheme 1 2 treatment arm overall 2:1 scheme ( HDV Insulin Lispro : Insulin Lispro ) . Both arm receive randomize treatment combination glargine detemir . Goal demonstrate efficacy HDV insulin lispro administer combination basal insulin ( HDV Insulin Lispro group ) non-inferior insulin lispro combination basal insulin ( Insulin Lispro group ) , effect glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) patient type 1 diabetes . If non-inferiority demonstrate , confirm HDV insulin lispro combination basal insulin ( HDV Insulin Lispro group ) superior insulin lispro combination basal insulin ( Insulin Lispro group ) , effect HbA1c patient type 1 diabetes ( ≥ 0.4 % decrease HbA1c ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase 2b , multicenter , randomize , double blind , titration clinical study , evaluate efficacy safety HDV Insulin Lispro Group versus Insulin Lispro Group patient type 1 diabetes 26 week treatment period . The patient randomize use centrally allocate randomization scheme 1 2 treatment arm overall 2:1 scheme ( HDV Insulin Lispro : Insulin Lispro ) . Both arm receive randomize treatment combination glargine detemir . SCREENING ( Visit 1 , Week -4 -1 ) Patients arrive Screening follow 8 hour fast . During Screening , patient sign inform consent form , review inclusion/exclusion , provide medical history , concomitant medication , demographic . They brief physical exam provide vital sign . Safety hematology/chemistry/urinalysis ( liver enzymes ) include infectious serology , serum pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . An ECG perform patient provide sample HbA1c determination . Patients take lispro/glargine lispro/detemir time Screening meet eligibility criterion proceed Visit 2 ( Week -1 ) . TREATMENT PERIOD Visit 1a ( Week -2 ) require patient must convert lispro prior Visit 3 ( Week 0 , randomization ) . Patients take non-lispro/glargine non-lispro/detemir use insulin pump convert lispro/glargine lispro/detemir ( respectively ) use equivalent insulin unit , proceed Visit 2 ( Week -1 ) 1 week new regimen . At Visit 2 ( Week -1 ) , patient receive CGM train use . Patients also first Mixed Meal Tolerance Test ( MMTT ) Visit 2 ( Week -1 ) accompany monitor blood ketone pre- post-ingestion . CGM MMTT repeat Visits 9 ( Week 12 ) 14 ( Week 25 ) . A diary , glucose meter , supply also provide Visit 2 ( Week -1 ) . Patients instructed perform self-monitored blood glucose measurement ( SMBG ) . During Visit 3 ( Week 0 ) , eligible patient randomize IWRS either treatment arm ( Test Group Control Group ) baseline data collect . All visit include progress review safety procedure . Safety hematology/chemistry/ urinalysis Visits 2 ( Week -1 ) , 10 ( Week 13 ) , 14 ( Week 25 ) 16 ( Week 27 ) include liver enzymes . At Visits 6 ( Week 5 ) 12 ( Week 19 ) , liver enzymes chemistry safety test perform . The chemistry safety test perform Visits 2 ( Week -1 ) , 9 ( Week 12 ) , 14 ( Week 25 ) blood ketone ; measure baseline 3 hour MMTT . HbA1c measure Visits 3 ( Week 0 ) , 4 ( Week 1 ) , 7 ( Week 7 ) , 10 ( Week 13 ) , 12 ( Week 19 ) , 15 ( Week 26 ) . Fasting blood glucose measure Visits 3 ( Week 0 ) , 10 ( Week 13 ) , 15 ( Week 26 ) . An in-clinic urine pregnancy test perform visit woman childbearing potential . MRI perform Visits 3 ( Week 0 ) 14 ( Week 25 ) approximately 20 % patient treatment arm . MRI may also perform case-by-case basis event abnormal liver enzyme result . Patients receive weekly telephone call PI designee discus insulin dose titration . FOLLOW-UP Visit 16 ( Week 27 ) safety follow-up visit include physical exam . Safety hematology/chemistry/ urinalysis ( include liver enzymes ) include urine pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . Concomitant medication , vital sign , adverse event record throughout entire study period .</detailed_description>
