	<brief_title>Cognitive Training Patients With Trichotillomania ( Hair-pulling Disorder )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction conceptualization Hair-pulling disorder ( HPD ) receive much attention comparison psychiatric illness . Considering South African research , limited number study focus HPD minimal focus treatment intervention . Several treatment regard pharmacotherapy psychotherapy develop investigate . Evidence suggest limited efficacy treatment , thus need intervention show well efficacy symptom reduction longer maintenance treatment gain , whilst also cost-effective easily accessible . Studies indicate patient HPD experience difficulty work memory ( WM ) , impulse control ( IC ) emotion regulation ( ER ) . The involvement frontoparietal circuitry , well frontal cortex , amygdalo-hippocampal formation putamen specify HPD . WM ER circuitry base frontoparietal neural circuit , thus train WM show potential also address ER difficulty . An intervention focus WM training , may promise address difficulty IC ER , thus appropriate treatment patient HPD . Cognitive training ( CT ) novel intervention focus enhance executive function specifically WM . WM task CT also focus frontoparietal network play role ER , therefore network activate executive functioning task , ER improve . The positive impact computerized cognitive training ( CCT ) neuroplasticity indicate pathway recently acknowledge . Psychotherapeutic support might readily available accessible people develop country , South Africa . Indeed , locally physical distance mental health centre cost individual session health care professional , challenge - prevent patient find help need . CT thus accessible cost-effective alternative . Cogmed Working Memory Training , internet-based CT program , investigated efficacy treatment HPD . Purpose study : The principal aim project establish impact CT patient primary HPD . Study finding also provide information whether internet base CT intervention , do patient ' home , feasible mode treatment HPD patient SA . The propose research focus follow objective : To determine effect CT ( 25 session 5 week ) WM , ER , IC hair-pulling severity ( HPS ) , patient HPD . To determine whether effect true CT program WM , ER , IC HPS differ active control program . To determine whether effect maintain 3 month post-intervention . To qualitatively explore participant ' subjective experience intervention process response CT ( term WM , ER , IC HPS ) . It hypothesise 5 week CT , treatment HPD group show significant improvement WM , ER , IC significant reduction HPS . The effect true CT program WM , ER , IC HPS significantly different active control group . During 3-month follow-up evaluation , HPD intervention group maintain reduction symptom treatment , compare active control HPD group . The treatment HPD group generally positive effect CT HPD function post-intervention 3-month follow-up consider CT easy use affordable . Study design : The study design 5-week , 25-session intervention study active control , 3-month follow-up evaluation . As registered clinical psychologist , principal investigator expertise diagnose , clinical interview , implement psychometric battery pre post intervention . Inclusion criterion primary diagnosis HPD ( DSM-5 ) ; Adults ( 18 year old ) ; Fluent English ; Access internet duration study participation . Exclusion criterion significant current DSM comorbidity ; Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) Score &gt; 20 exclude patient comorbid depressive syndrome ; Previous exposure cognitive training ( previous 'brain train ' game cell phone and/or computer allow ) . The criterion assess screening procedure . Participants enter study recruit randomly assign treatment active control group . Participants enter study randomize intervention active control group , use randomization list provide statistician . The intervention task ( Cogmed QM ) placebo ( Jigsaw Puzzles ) differ significantly . The principal investigator blind group participant , whereas participant blind group inclusion . It aim achieve sample size least 40 ( 20 treatment , 20 active control ) . This comparable group size HPD treatment study . The research method base embed theory design , utilize quantitative qualitative component . The benefit hybrid approach able investigate describe subject matter statistical power , well able comment participant 's experience , thus create richer holistic description research theme . The quantitative research consist pre- post intervention assessment battery , 3-month follow-up evaluation continuous information provide treatment intervention ( Cogmed ) . The qualitative data analysis do semi-structured interview , part pre- post assessment battery 3-month follow-up evaluation . Pre- post intervention data collection do principal investigator mean assessment battery include quantitative qualitative measure . Statistical analysis conduct use mixed model repeat measure ANOVA , suitable deal possible lose follow-up . Patients study treated random effect ( randomly select large population ) . Treatment ( intervention v placebo ) time ( pre , post , 3 month ) treat fixed effect . The treatment*time interaction effect primary effect investigation test whether change time two group . If intervention different effect placebo , interaction effect significant . Post hoc test do use Fisher Least Significant Difference ( LSD ) test . Normality assumption check analysis appropriately deal necessary , base nature data . A 5 % significance level use guideline significant result . The qualitative data analyse use interpretative phenomenological approach ( TerreBlanche , Durrheim , &amp; Kelly , 2010 ) , utilize qualitative data analysis software program , Atlas.ti . Anticipated benefit risk : CT investigate treatment intervention HPD reduction HPS guaranteed . However , HPS may reduce true CT program . Participants , part placebo group , get opportunity access true CT program completion study . Except fact might treatment group duration study due randomization , know risk involve participation . Ethical Considerations : The study procedure , risk benefit communicate lay terminology participant ( verbally write ) Afrikaans English . All data collect keep strictly confidential study result make public publish without compromise confidentiality . The demographic questionnaire remove questionnaire pack ensure complete questionnaire demographic detail link . Personal identifying detail name contact information record electronic database . All participant allocate unique study code electronic database . Identifiers link study code keep separate , password protect file . Only principal investigator access information . It clearly indicate participant free withdraw participation trial , without consequence . Participating individual incur cost .</detailed_description>
