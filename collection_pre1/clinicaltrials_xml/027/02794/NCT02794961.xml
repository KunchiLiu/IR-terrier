	<brief_title>CD22 Targeting CAR-T Therapy Against B Cell Hematological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CD19 ideal target great potential treat B-cell-derived hematological malignancy . Although complete remission rate high 93 % use CD19-targeting CAR-T technology , approximately 60 % patient recurrent disease . Among recurrent patient , two third reveal loss CD19 expression B cell surface . For overcome issue , establish new chimeric antigen receptor contain humanize single chain antibody sequence target CD22 molecule B cell .</detailed_description>
