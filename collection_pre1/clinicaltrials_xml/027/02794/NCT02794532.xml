	<detailed_description>Pre-oxygenation high-flow nasal cannula 100 % oxygen evaluate limited number study seem equal well traditional preoxygenation tight fit mask . Apneic oxygenation high-flow nasal cannula apnea demonstrates could safely 25 minute . Based , evaluate whether novel concept preoxygenation prolong time desaturation emergency anesthesia difficult airway situation . This could ultimately reduce number damage airway hypoxic injury . This novel concept already test clinical practice certain case strongly believe scientific evaluation approach need broad implementation . The patient undergo regular pre-anesthetic evaluation ask participate study . Oral write information give . A consent form sign . The patient randomize either traditional preoxygenation preoxygenation high-flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) oxygen . On arrival operating room standard patient monitoring apply ( ECG , pulse oximetry , non-invasive blood pressure ) preparation anesthesia induction do patient place slightly elevate head , approximately 25º . Peripheral oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) note breathe room air . If arterial line plan put place pre-oxygenation blood sample drawn breathing room air Preoxygenation hereafter take place either traditional way HFNC . The traditional preoxygenation consist breathe 100 % oxygen via tight-fitting non-rebreathing facial mask fresh gas flow ≥10 L/min ≥ 3 minute . HFNC pre-oxygenation consist application nasal cannulae ( Optiflow TM , Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare , Auckland , New Zealand ) nostrils patient receive 40L/min heat humidify 100 % oxygen ≥ 3 minute . After induction anesthesia RSI airways keep open manual adjustment anesthesiologist intubation regardless pre-oxygenation technique . During laryngoscopy intubation 70L/min humidify 100 % oxygen administer continuously nasal cannula leave place HFNC oxygen use . Endtidal carbon dioxide ( ETCO2 ) note start pre-oxygenation first breath intubation . If arterial line place blood gas sample take start pre-oxygenation ( breathe room air ) endotracheal tube place . Output data : - SpO2 breathing room air , end pre-oxygenation one minute intubation - ETCO2 pre-oxygenation first breath intubation - Time intubation ( measured start laryngoscopy ET tube correctly place ) - Total time high flow nasal cannula oxygen /traditional pre-oxygenation deliver - Blood pressure - Heart rate - ASA classification level - Smoker/non-smoker - BMI - Preoperative presence lung condition ( eg . chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , asthma ) yes/no - Preoperative oxygen therapy - Known/treated obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) yes/no - Type surgery : abdominal yes/no - Duration surgery , hour - Mallampati grade , thyromental distance , mouth open neck movement . - Cormack &amp; Lehane grade - Number attempt intubate - Use bougie intubation yes/no - Cricoid pressure use yes/no - Clinical suspicion aspiration intubation - Subjective experience pre oxygenation measure Visual Analogue Scale Disruption criteria The patient doesn´t tolerate pre-oxygenation way plan accord randomization . Statistics This randomize control study evaluate novel concept compare traditional technique . Continuous data present mean ± SD 95 % CI categorical data median range . We analyze data use Prism 6.0 ( GraphPad ) SPSS 24 ( IBM ) . We know primary outcome parameter ( low saturation within 1 min intubation ) , estimation base partly previous study ( Wimasalena et al . Ann Emerg Med 2015 ) assume low saturation control group 93 % 95 % treatment group SD 3 % . Using type I error 5 % type II error 20 % ( power 80 % ) sample size 70 patient group calculate . To allow miss data drop-outs plan include 100+100 patient ( total 200 patient ) . After inclusion 80 patient interim analysis perform primary outcome . A non-paired t-test perform analyse primary outcome .</detailed_description>
