	<brief_summary>This single-arm , open-label study . Patients enrolled induction therapy multiple myeloma , prior standard-of-care consolidation autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) . T cell harvest T cell manufacture prior ASCT , CART-19 infuse day ~60 post-ASCT , 3 day lymphodepleting chemotherapy . The primary endpoint progression-free survival ( PFS ) ASCT . As detailed , study power detect increase two-year PFS ~75 % baseline expectation 55 % base historical data . Secondary endpoint evaluate CART-19 persistence function , minimal residual disease , immune correlative endpoint , association progression-free survival ( PFS ) CART-19 persistence clinical biologic characteristic multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must age 1870 , inclusive , time enrollment . Subjects must ECOG performance status 02 . Subjects must confirm diagnosis active multiple myeloma accord IMWG criterion , summarize Table 6 . For circumstance encompass summary diagnostic criterion , reference make full publication IMWG criteria67 . In addition , subject must `` highrisk '' multiple myeloma accord one follow criterion : 1 . Any following highrisk cytogenetic feature , document FISH metaphase karyotyping : deletion 17p , ( 4 ; 14 ) , ( 14 ; 16 ) , ( 14 ; 20 ) . 2 . Standardrisk cytogenetics elevate LDH beta2microglobulin &gt; 5.5 mg/L ( i.e. , RISS stage III ) . At time enrollment , subject must within 9 month initiation systemic therapy multiple myeloma . Requirements preenrollment therapy : Subjects must receive receiving , time enrollment , `` RVD '' therapy ( combination therapy lenalidomide , bortezomib , dexamethasone ) . Patients must receive ≤6 cycle RVD time enrollment must progress ( IMWG criteria65 ) RVD . Patients may receive regimen prior RVD therapy limit ≤3 cycle . Patients may receive radiation therapy prior enrollment . Patients must receive infusional chemotherapy ( e.g. , VTDPACE similar regimen ) prior enrollment . Subjects must eligible ASCT receive melphalan dose 200 mg/m2 define follow criterion : 1 . Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40 % , 2 . AST/ALT ≤2.5 time upper limit normal 3 . Total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL , unless hyperbilirubinemia attributable solely Gilbert 's syndrome . 4 . Estimated ( CKDEPI CockgroftGault equation ) calculate CrCl ≥40 ml/min . 5 . DLCO ≥50 % predict correction anemia . Subjects must measurable disease standard serum urine test enable posttransplant monitoring progressionfree survival . Any following criterion sufficient define measurable disease . 1 . Serum Mspike ≥ 0.5 g/dL 2 . 24 hr urine Mspike ≥ 200mg 3 . Involved serum FLC ≥ 50 mg/L abnormal ratio 4 . For IgA multiple myeloma , total serum IgA level elevate normal range . Note : Measurable disease need document enrollment base historical lab result obtain since diagnosis multiple myeloma . For example , patient measurable disease enrollment due complete remission induction therapy eligible disease previously measurable one criterion . Subjects must sign write , informed consent . Subjects reproductive potential must agree use acceptable birth control method Subjects must : Be pregnant lactating . Have inadequate venous access contraindication leukapheresis . Have active uncontrolled infection . Any uncontrolled medical psychiatric disorder would preclude participation outline . Have NYHA Class III IV heart failure ( see Appendix 2 ) , unstable angina , history recent ( within 6 month ) myocardial infarction sustain ( &gt; 30 second ) ventricular tachyarrhythmias . Have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Have receive prior gene therapy genemodified cellular immunotherapy . Have active autoimmune disease , include connective tissue disease , uveitis , sarcoidosis , inflammatory bowel disease , multiple sclerosis , history severe ( judged principal investigator ) autoimmune disease require prolonged immunosuppressive therapy . Have prior active central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement ( e.g . leptomeningeal disease , parenchymal mass ) myeloma . Screening ( e.g . lumbar puncture ) require unless suspicious symptom present . Have contraindication postASCT maintenance lenalidomide . Have active infection HIV ( negative HIV 1/2 antibody screen ) , hepatitis C ( negative hepatitis C antibody screen ) , hepatitis B ( negative hepatitis B surface antigen ) . Any positive serology HIV viral hepatitis confirm appropriate confirmatory test conclude active infection present . Subjects positive hepatitis core antibody also exclude since effect longterm B cell depletion risk hepatitis B reactivation unknown . Patients known history prior diagnosis optic neuritis immunologic inflammatory disease affect central nervous system .</criteria>
