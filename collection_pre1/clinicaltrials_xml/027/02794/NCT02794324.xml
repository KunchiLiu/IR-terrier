	<brief_summary>Radiotherapy ( RT ) major curative role woman early breast cancer , recommend routinely lumpectomy selectively mastectomy . It contribute halve breast cancer mortality UK last 2 decade despite ever-rising cancer incidence . RT woman left-sided tumour often expose underlying heart damage dose . The heart sensitive RT , 1-2 death heart disease every 100 breast cancer patient treat 1960s-70s . The situation improve recent year , standard RT technique still deliver significant radiation dos heart tissue . Two potentially simple technique reduce heart dose . In one , woman teach breathe deeply hold breath 20 second RT give . The downward movement diaphragm pull heart away RT beam . In technique , woman lie front , instead back normally breast RT . In position , breast fall away rib cage reduces exposure heart . Neither technique routinely available woman receive breast RT UK reason research aim address . The investigator need : 1 ) confirm patient position reproduce millimetre precision every day use technique , 2 ) minimise cost equipment , time personnel require support technique , 3 ) select appropriate technique different patient 4 ) train staff centre across UK deliver technique safely effectively . By address issue , study aim ultimately make heart-sparing RT available UK woman might benefit treatment , thereby significantly reduce burden heart disease breast cancer survivor .</brief_summary>
