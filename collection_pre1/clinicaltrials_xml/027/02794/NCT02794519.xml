	<brief_summary>Sirukumab fully human anti interleukin ( IL ) -6 immunoglobulin G1-kappa monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) development treatment rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . The continue unmet need subject asthma refractory corticosteroid therapy increase understanding asthma pathogenesis stimulate development target biologics base predictive biomarkers . The majority approach date target T Helper 2 ( Th2 ) cytokines downstream effect . Targeting IL-6 severe asthma represent unprecedented approach potential address non-Th2 driver severe asthma . This multicenter , randomize , double-blind ( sponsor-unblind ) , placebo-controlled , parallel group study investigate efficacy sirukumab compare placebo subject uncontrolled severe asthma despite use high dose inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) combination long-acting Beta-agonist ( LABA ) . The study employ variable treatment period individual subject . Dosing continue every 4 week week 44 ( inclusive ) , 24 week final subject randomize , whichever sooner . Upon receive final dose study medicine placebo , subject enter 16 week Follow Up period . Overall , duration participation subject complete full 44-week treatment period Follow Up period may 64 week . Approximately 175 subject randomize 140 evaluable subject complete study .</brief_summary>
