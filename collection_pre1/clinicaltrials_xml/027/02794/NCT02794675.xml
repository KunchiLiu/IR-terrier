	<brief_summary>The purpose study explore use treatment call interstitial brachytherapy patient high risk resectable ( able treat surgery ) recurrent head neck cancer . Brachytherapy form radiation therapy use radioactive seed implant specific place body . This study use Cesium-131 permanent interstitial brachytherapy . Cesium-131 FDA approve brachytherapy use , however , currently research study show effective head neck cancer . The goal study determine effect placement Cesium-131 brachytherapy seed overall survival well assess possible side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To assess effect Cesium 131 brachytherapy subject resectable recurrent cancer head neck evaluate disease free survival ( DFS ) compare previous cohort . Potential effect locoregional control rate overall survival explore . Secondary Objective : To assess toxicity associate cesium 131 brachytherapy treatment . Study Design Patients head neck recurrent cancer plan undergo definitive tumor resection surgery meet inclusion exclusion criterion offer participation clinical trial . Participant 's Follow-up . The participant 's medical record review every 3 month 24 month assess : loco-regional control , distant metastasis free survival , disease free survival , overall survival . This allow u assess potential treatment effect cesium 131 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must histologically cytologically confirm recurrent head neck cancer . Based clinical radiographic evidence tumor need deem resectable preoperatively surgeon necessary ( determined surgeon ) tumor board review . Patient must clear surgery low/moderate risk perioperative complication relate general anesthesia Patients must potentially curable disease Karnofsky Performance status ≥ 60 % Subjects must normal organ marrow function define : Hemoglobin ≥ 7.0 g/dl Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 500/mcL Platelet count ≥ 75,000 x 10^9 Patients recurrent/previous treat head neck squamous cell carcinoma deem surgically resectable treat physician high risk recurrence due concern regard close and/or margin due location near critical structure internal common carotid , skull base , deep cervical musculature , area may limit possibility enbloc resection . This group otherwise would consider retreatment radiation and/or chemoradiation . Subjects must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients deem unresectable disease treat surgeon upon tumor board review . Patients expose carotid artery preoperatively require sacrifice bypass intraoperatively Patients active pharyngocutaneous fistula Patients may recent previous hospital admission ( within 30 day ) admit preoperatively follow condition Unstable angina Congestive heart failure Severe hypothyroidism TSH &gt; 10 Endocrine consult intervention may allow participation discretion principal investigator thyroidstimulating hormone ( TSH ) &gt; 10 . Patients deem `` High Risk '' pre admission test ( CPM ) preoperative risk assessment hospitalist perioperative complication Subjects one site distant metastatic disease ( beyond head neck ) evidence computerized tomography ( CT ) scan positron emission tomography/CT ( PET/CT ) biopsy A subject single lung nodule ( deem cancerous PET/CT Biopsy ) exclude . Subjects receive investigational agent . Subjects untreated brain metastases/central nervous system disease exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Cesium 131 agent use study . Pregnant breastfeed woman exclude study Cesium 131 potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown , potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother Cesium 131 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated Cesium 131 . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Subjects HIVpositive exclude study . Patients unresectable tumor .</criteria>
