	<brief_summary>Aim : To evaluate clinical survival fluoride sealant apply first permanent molar affect Molar-Incisor Hypomineralization ( MIH ) . Material Methods : For case control study , select 41 first permanent molar 21 child age 6-8 year . MIH classify one calibrate examiner ( kappa 0.80 ) accord severity MIH lesion ( EAPD , 2003 ) . Inclusion criterion FPM MIH sound ( without MIH ) , fully erupt , sealant treatment indication . The FPMs assign two group : G1 - Control group G2 - MIH group . Both group teeth treat sealant application ( Fluroshield , NY , USA ) . Clinical follow-up perform baseline , 1 , 6 , 12 18 month anatomic form , marginal adaptation , retention presence caries , accord United States Public Health Service USPHS-Modified blind examiner ( kappa 0.80 ) . The Acturial Method use evaluate survival sealant . Statistical analysis compare rating criterion material use Fisher 's exact test level significance 5 % ( p &lt; 0.05 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct accord Helsink Declaration . The approval obtain Ethics Research Committee Araraquara Dental School , São Paulo , Brazil ( protocol # 11/09 ) . All parents/guardians child sign informed consent . Study design : This case control study include four clinical exam perform 6 8 years-old child receive preventive treated sealant , divide 2 group : G1 - teeth affect MIH G2 - teeth affect MIH . Subjects : The 21 child include study previously diagnose MIH , accord EAPD criterion . A total 41 first permanent molar teeth ( FPM ) include , 16 without MIH 25 MIH . Calibration examiner evaluation : The examiner calibrate accord MIH base criterion propose European Academy Pediatric Dentistry USPHS-Modified . The examiner assess 32 clinical photograph patient Clinic Pediatric Dentistry Araraquara Dental School São Paulo , Brazil , follow discussion MIH research team indices code . After agreement , 30 patient enamel alteration ( 17 MIH ) evaluate . After 2 week , patient reevaluate Kappa coefficient use verify agreement evaluation . The intra-examiner value MIH USPHS-modified 0.80 . Treatment : The 41 FMP clinically examine classified accord presence MIH accord European Association Paediatric Dentistry distribute group . The preventive procedure perform Pedodontics Clinics São Paulo State University , another operator . All teeth receive pre-treat care 4 weekly application fluoride varnish ( Duraphat , NY , USA ) . Both group teeth treated sealant . Evaluation : The four clinical exam ( 1 , 6 , 12 18 month ) perform clinical environment accord exam preconized World Health Organization artificial light prophylaxis . The sealant clinically evaluate calibrated examiner ( Kappa 0.80 ) . The group evaluate accord criterion quality restoration propose United States Public Health Service USPHS-Modified classify satisfactory unsatisfactory . When tooth consider unsatisfactory , consider failure treatment replace consider research evaluation .</detailed_description>
