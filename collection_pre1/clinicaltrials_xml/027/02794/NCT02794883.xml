	<brief_summary>The main purpose trial investigate effect new class drug help patient 's immune system attack tumor ( glioblastoma multiforme - GBM ) . These drug already show benefit cancer type explore GBM . Both tremelimumab durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) `` investigational '' drug , mean drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Both drug antibody ( protein use immune system fight infection cancer ) . Durvalumab attach protein tumor call PD-L1 . It may prevent cancer growth help certain blood cell immune system get rid tumor . Tremelimumab stimulate ( wake ) immune system attack tumor inhibit protein molecule call CTLA-4 immune cell . Combining action drug may result good treatment option patient glioblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tremelimumab Durvalumab Combination Alone Treating Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine T-cell change occur glioblastoma ( GBM ) treat tremelimumab durvalumab ( MEDI4736 ) single agent combination . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety either tremelimumab MEDI4736 alone combination patient GBM . II . To determine time progression patient treat either tremelimumab MEDI4736 alone combination , post-surgery . III . To determine overall survival patient treat tremelimumab MEDI4736 alone combination post-surgery . IV . To assess magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) change patient treat either tremelimumab MEDI4736 alone combination post-surgery . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate T-cell change program death ligand 1 ( PDL1 ) expression patient outcomes . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 arm . ARM 1 : Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM 2 : Patients receive durvalumab IV 1 hour day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM 3 : Patients receive tremelimumab IV 1 hour day 1 , gap 1 hour first cycle , durvalumab IV 1 hour day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 4 week tremelimumab 7 course every 2 week durvalumab 14 course . Patients receive tremelimumab durvalumab IV 1 hour every 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . All patient undergo surgical tumor resection day 14 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 8-16 week 2 year .</detailed_description>
