	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine , preterm infant &lt; 37 week ' gestation birth receive oxygen without ventilatory/CPAP support , oxygen environment ( OE ) compare nasal cannula oxygen ( NC ) , decrease number episode oxygen saturation less 85 % ≥10 second 48 hour cross period either intervention . This randomized cross-over pilot study 1:1 parallel allocation infant oxygen environment nasal cannula oxygen use stratify permuted block design . Following 24 hour period first intervention , infant cross 24 hour period second ( alternative ) intervention cross back first intervention 24 hour back second ( alternative ) intervention 24 hour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Environmental Nasal Cannula Oxygen Preterm Infants Receiving Oxygen Therapy : Randomized Cross-over Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In preterm infant &lt; 37 week ' gestation birth require oxygen without ventilatory/CPAP support , oxygen environment decrease number episode oxygen saturation less 85 % ≥ 10 second 48 hour cross-over period either intervention compare nasal cannula oxygen ? The target oxygen saturation ( 91 95 % ) base data meta-analysis randomize controlled trial oxygen saturation target include data 4911 infant SUPPORT , COT , BOOST II trial . This study include preterm infant &lt; 37 week ' gestation oxygen therapy via OE NC flow rate ≤ 1.0 l/kg/min . There three randomization stratum [ ≥ 22+0/7 ≤ 25+6/7 week , ≥ 26+0/7 ≤ 28+6/7 week , ≥ 29+0/7 ≤ 36+6/7 week ' gestation ] . The purpose stratification ensure appropriate distribution risk study arm . This study power detect outcome difference within stratum . Following informed consent , randomization , stratify gestational age delivery , perform use sequentially number seal opaque envelope . Each envelope indicate either Treatment group ( OE group ) Control group ( NC group ) . The envelope open informed consent obtain start study infant . This single center randomize cross-over pilot study 1:1 parallel allocation infant oxygen environment nasal cannula oxygen use stratify permuted block design . Following 24 hour period first intervention 15-30 minute washout period , infant cross-over 24 hour period second/alternate intervention . Following 15-30 minute washout period , infant cross-over 24 hour period first intervention . Following another 15-30 minute washout period , infant cross-over 24 hour period second/alternate intervention . The effective FiO2 calculate infant base oxygen therapy modality prior monitoring period use swap mode . All infant enrol study routine monitoring , uniform target saturation range 91-95 % alarm limit set 88-95 % , standard care duration study . Pulse oximetry recording download use ixTrend ( iexcellence , Wildau , Germany ) software secure computer system later data analysis . Infants continue standard treatment recommend treat physician act control . Primary secondary outcomes describe . Other safety outcome include recording episode bradycardia circumstance surround event .
