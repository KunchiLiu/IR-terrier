	<brief_summary>The propose study prospective cohort study select group emergency physicians Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital ( KATH ) Ghana train cardiopulmonary ultrasound ( CPUS ) . Following training , patient present ED undifferentiated shock and/or dyspnea either receive usual customary care supplement cardiopulmonary ultrasonography-guided diagnosis treatment initial resuscitation , usual customary care alone depend whether treat physician receive CPUS training . The main outcome impact CPUS correct diagnosis . Information regard initial treatment strategy , diagnose 24-hour mortality collect via manual review paper chart medical record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods : The training protocol pilot study develop collaborative effort involve emergency medicine physician University Michigan ( UM ) KATH . Select resident physician ( approximately 1/3 emergency medicine resident physician ) KATH participate one-week , hands-on ultrasound course concentrate solidify preexist skill ultrasound , focus RUSH BLUE protocols assessment critically ill patient . Resident physician train , attend physician routinely present majority patient evaluation . The RUSH ( Rapid Ultrasound SHock ) protocol first describe publication 2010 since become widely use throughout country aid identify cause shock patient . It three-step ultrasound scanning protocol , first evaluate `` pump '' heart , second `` tank '' intravascular volume status , third `` pipe '' large artery vein . Ultrasound finding exam compare typically see hypovolemic shock , cardiogenic shock , obstructive shock distributive shock ( 1 ) . The BLUE ( Bedside Lung Ultrasound Emergency ) protocol initially publish 2008 quick tool determine diagnosis acute respiratory failure . Based ultrasound finding , scan protocol provide specific profile six main cause acute respiratory distress , pulmonary edema , pulmonary embolism , pneumonia , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , asthma , pneumothorax ( 2 ) . As emergency physician KATH previously express interest receiving training , offer train physician three different cohort , 1/3 initially , 1/3 part way study , 1/3 end . The physician initial train group chosen base availability work schedule . The participant take test prior begin train also end . They also require pas OSCE ( Objective Structured Clinical Exam ) end week . One week allocate ultrasound training , allow physician participate practice new skill . These select resident make cohort CPUS-trained physician . The pilot study conduct four-month period emergency department KATH . All patient present ED screen study inclusion criterion define triage nurse , informed consent obtain research assistant patient deem competent . All patient immediately receive usual customary care , include physical examination , IV access , continuous cardiac monitoring , supplemental oxygen . Following initial assessment , treat physician ask choose likely diagnosis provide checklist . All checklist design specifically research purpose study information document checklist use clinical decision-making . The information contain checklist base well-validated RUSH BLUE protocol use strictly context protocol . The physician fill checklist part study team KATH . When patient meet inclusion criterion treat physician receive CPUS-training , patient receive CPUS exam addition standard care . In addition CPUS exam , ultrasound exam deem necessary clinical care occur normally part regular standard care . Ultrasound withhold patient part clinical care . There aspects study conduct prior enrollment impact care study design . Patients CPUS group receive image concordance standardize RUSH BLUE protocols finding document second checklist . Emergency physician train CPUS perform ultrasound exam , choose likely diagnosis initial checklist . The pre-ultrasound post-ultrasound diagnosis record comparison . Diagnostic accuracy assess base post-hoc review hospital record . Ultrasound competency assess intermittently mean direct supervision site visit ensure skill degradation ensure safety study participant . Data Analysis : Power analysis perform primary outcome diagnostic accuracy . Assuming baseline 60 % correct diagnosis calculate 158 subject require detect absolute 30 % increase correct diagnosis . A minimum 180 patient enrolled account loss follow-up . Additionally , information gather pilot study use help guide plan long-term follow-up study future . During initial ultrasound training , competency assess use pre post-tests , addition OSCE ( Objective Structured Clinical Exam ) . General Linear Model ( GLM ) framework , pretest score covariate , use analyze pre post-test data . All data pilot study collect I-pads paper copy transfer CSV-formatted file research assistant . Data examine use SPSS statistical analysis software use linear ( multiple ) logistic regression analysis . A p-value &lt; 0.05 interpret statistically significant . Ethical Considerations : Ethics approval seek Committee Human Research , Publication Ethics ( CHRPE ) School Medical Sciences , Kwame Nkrumah University science Technology ( S.M.S.-K.N.U.S.T . ) Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) University Michigan . All patient consider take part study provide consent form describe intervention give sufficient time decide whether participate . When informed consent obtain patient due incapacitation impair decision-making , consent obtain next kin legally authorize representative . Legal guardian head household serve proxy legally authorize representative . According local custom , case parent `` head family '' give proxy . This person may court documentation present family accept one make decision . Only adult , age 18 , include study . The subject population consist community surround KATH see range patient , child adult . Only adults meeting inclusion criterion include study . Confidentiality maintain de-identifying patient information early possible study store personal information data secure server United States likely effective protect patient information . In report , data discussion confidential .</detailed_description>
