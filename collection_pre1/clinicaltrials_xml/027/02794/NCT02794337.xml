	<brief_summary>Vast majority patient hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) present unresectable disease . In last decade result randomize trial subsequent metaanalyses establish transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) systemic chemotherapy ( sorafenib ) standard care . However , TACE alone curative approach . The two year survival follow TACE range 31-63 % almost 100 % patient develop disease progression treatment . There need investigate additional therapeutic option would consolidate initial response TACE . A recent metaanalyses conclude addition high dose radiation TACE result 10-35 % improvement two year overall survival . However result metaanalyses base study small sample size , unclear randomization procedure heterogenous dose radiation , need conduct high quality randomize study highlight The present study design investigate role high dose conformal radiation consolidation therapy TACE patient nonmetastatic unresectable HCC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Resection liver transplant curative treatment patient hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) however vast majority patient present unresectable disease . In last decade result randomize trial subsequent metaanalyses establish transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) standard care patient Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer ( BCLC ) stage B . However , TACE alone curative approach . The two year survival follow TACE range 31-63 % almost 100 % patient develop disease progression treatment . There need investigate additional therapeutic option would consolidate initial response TACE . A recent metaanalyses include 17 trial ( 5 randomize 12 non randomize study ) conclude addition high dose radiation TACE result upto 10-35 % improvement two year overall survival . However result metaanalyses base study small sample size , unclear randomization procedure heterogenous dose radiation , need conduct high quality randomize study highlight . The present study design investigate role high dose conformal radiation consolidation therapy TACE patient nonmetastatic unresectable HCC . With integrated phase II/III design study investigate impact local radiation therapy infield progression free survival patient locally advance unresectable HCC .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis HCC . Tissue diagnosis mandatory however desirable . In absence tissue diagnosis image finding characteristic HCC use . i.e . high risk population nodule arterial phase enhancement wash portovenous phase consider diagnostic HCC . In patient one image conclusive another imaging modality use . However second imaging also inconclusive Alpha Feto Protein ( AFP ) within nondiagnostic borderline range tissue diagnosis deem mandatory . Barcelona Stage B/ Barcelona A deem suitable Sx refuse surgery . Child Pugh A/Select Child Pugh B ( score7/10 ) . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 01 . Total number measurable target lesion 2 less 2 , encompass within single hepatic field 2 different hepatic field without exceed safe dose limit constraint . Optimal predict liver volume reserve &gt; 700 cc . No Contraindication TACE . Tumor consider sufficiently away GI structure deliver safe radiation dose ( &gt; 1 cm ) . Willing molecular banking tumour tissue ( optional ) . Metastatic nodal disease stag investigation . Child C Cirrhosis previous history liver failure . Expected life span &lt; 6 month . Active variceal bleeding sign hepatic decompensation . Portal venous thrombosis render patient unsuitable TACE . However pt suitable superselective TACE consider trial inclusion .</criteria>
