	<brief_title>Efficacy VAS203 ( Ronopterin ) Patients With Moderate Severe Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe moderate traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) constitute major health problem . TBI lead cause death disability among young adult develop country , incidence elderly population increase . Neurological damage TBI cause accident , evolve afterwards . The posttraumatic secondary injury include - among others - inflammation oedema formation subsequent increase intracranial pressure . A key molecule process gas nitric oxide , produce excess neuroinflammation . Ronopterin ( VAS203 ) inhibitor nitric oxide synthase . Ronopterin reduce excess nitric oxide production subsequent secondary injury .</detailed_description>
