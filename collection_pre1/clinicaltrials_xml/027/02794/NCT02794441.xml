Randomization stratify baseline migraine duration : 1 ) less 2 hour , 2 ) 2 hour less 24 hour 3 ) 24 hour great . A list randomization code generate computer biostatistician randomization occur block four . Research personnel access randomization code list group assignment . Only research pharmacists access list . The research assistant collect outcome data participant store Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCaP ) , secure , encrypt web-based platform . Participants option complete follow-up via email questionnaire telephone . Follow-up take place 48 hour 7 day discharge . The purpose follow-up ass whether participant recurrence migraine , collect follow-up outcome data safety data . The research assistant , participant , research personnel clinical personnel blind group assignment . Only research pharmacist , interact anyone study directly , access group assignment information . Data analysis carry exploratory purpose , group ( dexamethasone vs. placebo ) compare regard : baseline data , 48 hour migraine recurrence rate , 7 day migraine recurrence rate , proportion participant achieve pain freedom 2 hour maintain 48 hour , patient satisfaction data adverse event .</detailed_description>
