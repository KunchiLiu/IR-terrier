	<brief_summary>Breast conservation surgery ( BCS ) perform patient breast cancer intent resect completely remove tumour conserve much surround normal tissue possible . Currently , way surgeon determine adequacy surgical resection real-time surgery ; assessment surgical margin require histological examination available real-time impractical clinical case . This result re-excision rate 23 % among Canadian woman order achieve optimal surgical margin . In addition , presence absence cancer tumor drain lymph node recognize key element breast cancer staging ; however , lymph node dissection associate overtreatment morbidity ( nerve damage post surgical lymphedema ) histological analysis node time consume thus delay subsequent procedure . In effort address issue , design construct , collaboration Sogang University , Seoul , S. Korea , novel image system performs three complementary image modality ( tri-modal ) : ultrasound ( US ) , photoacoustic ( PA ) fluorescence ( FL ) . This first-in-human pilot study recruit 10 breast cancer patient undergo breast conserving surgery Princess Margaret Hospital ( Toronto , Canada ) . The study design test tri-modal ( US , PA , FL ) image technology breast cancer patient . The overall goal obtain initial information technical feasibility tri-modal system peri-operative setting confirm anticipate safety procedure . Additionally , provide initial data ability system detect/localize primary breast cancer lesion cancer-involved lymph node prior surgery .</brief_summary>
