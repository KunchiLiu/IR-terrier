	<brief_summary>Combat-JUDO ( Combating Juvenile Diabetes Obesity normalization beta-cell function ) part collaborative project fund Seventh Framework Programme European Commission aim develop innovative therapeutic strategy increase pharmacology-based alternative target insulin hypersecretion treatment young obese individual . The prevalence childhood obesity range 5-25 % Europe . The reason behind alarm figure mostly change environment sedative lifestyle supply excess food . However , specific gene mutation also link obesity new gene continuously discover . There effective mean intervention child obesity available today . Obesity closely associate number relate metabolic disease child obesity develop metabolic syndrome early stage life . Individuals obesity increase risk develop type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) current increase childhood obesity , child develop T2DM already adolescent year huge impact long-term health life expectancy . Lifestyle modification intervention , include behavioural treatment , diet modification physical activity , cornerstone primary secondary prevention/treatment pediatric obesity today . Exenatide GLP-1 ( glucagon-like peptide-1 ) receptor agonist approve use adult T2DM improve glycemic control . A pilot study exenatide treatment non-diabetic child adolescent severe obesity show reduced BMI approximately 5 % improved marker insulin resistance β-cell function observe . The Combat-JUDO study parallel , double-blind , randomize study compare lifestyle intervention + exenatide 2 mg vs lifestyle intervention + placebo adolescent obesity . The lifestyle intervention include regular nutritional psychological support 4 occasion study well physical activity weekly basis . Exenatide/placebo give subcutaneous injection weekly 24 week . The primary objective study compare change BMI-SDS ( accord WHO ) baseline 6 month visit two treatment arm . The study include male female age 10-18 year 5 month BMI SDS &gt; 2.0 age-adapted BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 .</brief_summary>
