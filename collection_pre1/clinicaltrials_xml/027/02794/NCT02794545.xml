	<brief_summary>Although combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) significantly reduce morbidity mortality , still fail eradicate HIV . Given difficulty eradication HIV , functional cure likely achieve goal . In recent breakthrough scientific report , already exist several example HIV-infected case achieve status functional cure early administration cART newborns early infected case . From Taiwan center disease control ( CDC ) report clinical experience , young men get HIV infection important finding investigator find newly infect , let 's say , within six month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Cure Study HIV-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study target newly HIV- infect cohort urge receive cART order achieve possible status HIV function cure . After 3~5 year period treatment , cART discontinue laboratory evaluation functional cure anticipate . These patient achieve good life quality . In addition elimination risk HIV transmission , cART expense government reduce large scale . The core study aim set precise standard laboratory methodology detect newly infect case predict time stop cART . Once assay method well establish , widely apply assess previous case long term cART prediction appropriate time stop cART . Thru conventional HIV test ( within sero-conversion stage ) , detection rate early infection 5-10 % . Therefore desperately important develop tool diagnosis early infection . In addition standard method detect HIV infection , investigator use HIV p24 Ag test detuned Enzyme-linked Immunoblotting assay ( EIA ) assay detect early infection . For na√Øve patient , investigator also check resistance test antiretroviral drug order adjust choose susceptible cART patient . During cART period , investigator follow patient check quantity HIV RNA proviral DNA ( HIV DNA ) Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) blood . After three five year cART , HIV RNA detect HIV DNA low , investigator draw blood patient isolate Cluster Differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) receptor + T cell co-cultivated PBMCs healthy cohort evaluate existence HIV infectivity cART treat case . If infectivity , investigator stop cART . After stop cART , investigator follow case every six month till least two year check HIV antibody , HIV RNA HIV DNA PBMCs observe whether HIV recurrence occurs .</detailed_description>
