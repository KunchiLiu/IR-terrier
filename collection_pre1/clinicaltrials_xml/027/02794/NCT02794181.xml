	<brief_summary>Background : Zika virus mostly pass bite infect mosquito . It usually cause mild illness . But pregnant woman cause serious birth defect baby . The virus also spread blood transfusion sexual intercourse . This U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration ( FDA ) recommend people give blood possibly expose Zika virus . Dengue virus chikungunya virus pass mosquito Zika virus . These cause severe reaction pass transfused blood . Donated blood usually test three virus . Researchers want count infection people expose travel sexual exposure . They want learn risk virus might pose U.S. blood supply . They also want study natural history virus follow infected people time . Objective : To study risk Zika , dengue , chikungunya virus U.S. blood supply . Eligibility : Adults age 18 older turn donate blood possible exposure certain virus . Design : Participants blood urine test . They answer question travel . They call week virus test result . Participants negative result study visit . Participants positive result ask stay study 6 month . They weekly clinic visit test result negative 2 straight week . Once test result negative , monthly visit . Visits include physical exam , blood urine sample , optional semen sample men . Most people 3-4 weekly visit 5 monthly visit ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Zika virus ( ZIKV ) Aedes species mosquito-transmitted Flavivirus responsible ongoing epidemic twenty country territory Caribbean , North , Central South America . A 20-fold increase risk microcephaly report newborn infected mother Brazil . Of nine identify pregnant traveler return U.S. area local ZIKV infection , five experience severe neonatal outcome . ZIKV transmit via blood transfusion sexual exposure ZIKV-infected man . In response , AABB ( formerly American Association Blood Banks ) make recommendation Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) issue guidance donor deferral base 1 ) travel location active ZIKV transmission ; 2 ) sexual exposure man travel area active ZIKV transmission . Further , Aedes species mosquito vector transmit ZIKV also transmit dengue virus ( DENV ) chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) . Areas local ZIKV transmission also commonly local DENV CHIKV transmission . DENV CHIKV transmissible via blood transfusion result severe outcome transfusion recipient . The primary aim study : 1 ) ass prevalence ZIKV , DENV CHIKV infection ( RNA-positives ) among adult attempt donate blood defer travel place local transmission ZIKV , DENV and/or CHIKV ( travel-deferred donor ) ; 2 ) ass prevalence ZIKV infection ( RNA-positives ) among adult attempt donate blood defer due potential sexual exposure ZIKV infection ; 3 ) ass prevalence ZIKV , DENV CHIKV infection ( RNA-positives ) among blood donor whose blood platelet collect call back report illness within 2 week donation ; 4 ) study 24-week natural history ZIKV , DENV CHIKV infection among deferred adult donor test RNA-positive agent .</detailed_description>
