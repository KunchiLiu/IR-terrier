	<detailed_description>Alport Syndrome inherit disease primarily affect glomerulus , tiny tuft capillary kidneys filter waste blood . The disease first describe English doctor name A. Cecil Alport . This disease cause change gene ( mutation ) affect type IV collagen , protein important normal structure function glomerulus . The early symptom disease blood urine ( hematuria ) . Alport Syndrome always affect kidney . Many people Alport Syndrome also hear problem abnormality eye , type IV collagen protein important normal structure function inner ear eye . Other sign symptom may include : - Blood urine ( hematuria ) , common early sign Alport syndrome - Protein urine ( proteinuria ) - Swelling leg , ankle , foot around eye These sign symptom may differ , base age , gender genetic type Alport Syndrome . For example , hear vision problem tend common male female . High blood pressure usually detect later life . The central feature disease presence blood urine ( hematuria ) . Boys X-linked Alport Syndrome develop hematuria infancy , always present . The great majority girl X-linked Alport Syndrome also hematuria ; hematuria Alport Syndrome usually microscopic , mean detect microscope urine dipstick . Sometimes child Alport Syndrome brown , pink red urine ( gross hematuria ) several day , bring cold flu . This gross hematuria go away may frighten , harmful . As boys Alport Syndrome grow , begin show sign kidney disease , include protein urine high blood pressure . These symptom often present time boys teenager . Girls Alport Syndrome usually protein urine high blood pressure much later life , occasionally symptoms appear teenaged girl Alport Syndrome . Progressive hearing loss another important feature Alport Syndrome . About 80 % boys Alport Syndrome develop progressive hearing loss point life , often time teenager . The progressive hearing loss affect ear . Fortunately , hear aid usually effective people . Girls Alport Syndrome may also develop progressive hearing loss , less frequently boys , usually late life . Kidney transplantation improve progressive hearing loss Alport Syndrome . About 15 % men Alport Syndrome abnormality shape lens call anterior lenticonus . People anterior lenticonus may problem vision , may develop cataract . Alport Syndrome cause progressive kidney damage . The glomerulus normal kidney structure tubules gradually replace scar tissue , lead kidney failure . All boys Alport Syndrome , regardless genetic type , eventually develop kidney failure . These boy often need dialysis transplantation teenage young adult year , kidney failure occur late 40-50 year age men Alport Syndrome . Most girls X-linked type Alport Syndrome develop kidney failure . However , woman Alport Syndrome get old risk kidney failure increase . All boys girl autosomal recessive type Alport Syndrome develop kidney failure , usually teens young adult year . People autosomal dominant Alport Syndrome usually live well middle age kidney failure develop . Currently , diagnosis Alport Syndrome relies careful evaluation patient 's sign symptom , along family history . Hearing vision also test . The evaluation also include blood test , urine test , kidney biopsy determine Alport Syndrome . A genetic test help confirm diagnosis determine genetic type Alport Syndrome . Currently specific treatment Alport Syndrome . The treatment use people high blood pressure symptoms kidney disease use people Alport Syndrome . Kidney transplantation usually successful people Alport Syndrome , consider best treatment end-stage kidney failure approach . There three genetic type Alport Syndrome . X-linked ( related X chromosome ) common form Alport Syndrome . About 80 % people disease X-linked type . Boys type severely affect always develop kidney failure sometime life . Girls type usually milder symptom boy , develop kidney failure . The rest people Alport Syndrome either autosomal recessive type affect 15 percent , autosomal dominant type , affect 5 percent . If one parent disease pass abnormal gene child , call dominant inheritance . In word , one copy abnormal gene need cause disease . If parent carry abnormal gene , parent pass abnormal gene child , call recessive inheritance . Both copy abnormal gene need cause autosomal recessive version disease . New method , like mass-spectrometry give good chance characterize specific metabolic alteration blood ( plasma ) affect patient allow diagnose future disease earlier , high sensitivity specificity . Therefore goal study identify validate new biochemical marker plasma affect patient help benefit patient early diagnose thereby earlier treatment .</detailed_description>
