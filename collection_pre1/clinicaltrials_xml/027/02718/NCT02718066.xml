	<brief_summary>A Phase 1b/2 Study Assess Safety Efficacy HBI-8000 Combination Nivolumab Patients Advanced Solid Tumors Including Melanoma , Renal Cell Carcinoma ( RCC ) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) . The Primary objective study : • To evaluate safety tolerability HBI-8000 combined standard dose regimen nivolumab , determine Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose ( RP2D ) evaluate frequency severity toxicity combination treatment Secondary objective include : - To explore efficacy study treatment measure Objective Response Rate ( ORR ) , Disease Control Rate ( DCR ) , Clinical Benefit Rate ( CBR ) , Duration Response ( DoR ) , Progression-Free Survival ( PFS ) patient treat RP2D - To obtain pharmacokinetics twice weekly HBI-8000 administer combination nivolumab administer every two week - To characterize effect HBI-8000 electrocardiogram QT interval correct ( QTc ) interval . Dose Escalation Phase ( 1b ) include 18 patient , follow Cohort Expansion Phase ( 2 ) include 20 patient per tumor indication MTD and/or RP2D .</brief_summary>
