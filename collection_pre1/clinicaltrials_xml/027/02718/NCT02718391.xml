	<brief_title>Complementary Vaccination With Dendritic Cells Pulsed With Autologous Tumor Lysate Resected Stage III IV Melanoma Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize phase II trial ( 1:1 allocation ratio ) resect stage III/IV melanoma patient . The randomization list stratify stage ( III IV M1a-b IVM1c ) , time primitive tumor first metastasis ( ≤ 2 year versus &gt; 2 year ) . Five randomization list define , one stratum . On basis literature , investigator assume median relapse-free survival 7.0 month standard group . With two-sided tailed alpha 0.10 power 80 % , assume median relapse-free survival 11.7 month experimental arm ( hazard ratio 0.60 ) , necessary recruit 60 patient per arm period 24 month subsequent 12 month follow-up . In context data monitor board activity , interim analysis futility , accord Bayesian approach , perform 18 month order control safety . Primary endpoint relapse free survival . Secondary end point OS , In vivo vitro immunomonitoring . Immunologic efficacy measure best Delayed Type Hypersensitivity score ( reactivity lysate KLH ) obtain least 4 vaccine dos , alone combine Interferon-g ELISPOT analysis tumor antigen-specific circulating effector obtain minimum 4 vaccine dos , compare prevaccine sample . In vivo monitoring focus functional phenotyping circulate immune effectors/regulators , functional characterization circulate tumor antigen-specific immune effector regulator , identification serum marker predictive response .</detailed_description>
