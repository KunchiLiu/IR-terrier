The stent position lie within WON enteric lumen . The stent deploy one flange stent locate within WON cavity flange locate within enteric lumen . The Axios stent dilate least 13.5-15mm follow deployment use 12-15mm balloon . 3 . An attempt irrigation/lavage WON cavity endoscopy unit immediately follow stent deployment use 2L normal saline perform . This do use forward view gastroscope endoscopic accessory ( push dilation catheter , balloon catheter etc. ) . 7 . Direct endoscopic necrosectomy perform session initial stent placement . 8 . The following information collect time initial endoscopic procedure : 1 . Location size collection EUS measurement ( two perpendicular measurement ) 2 . Intraprocedure complication ( bleed , pneumoperitoneum , perforation , hemodynamic instability ) 3 . Procedure duration . Initial procedure ( start time : advancement endoscope patient ; end time : withdrawal echoendoscope , gastroscope duodenoscope patient end procedure ) Follow-up Procedures : Post-procedure management : 1 . Oral antibiotic administer total ten day pending result fluid gram stain culture . Antimicrobial therapy thereafter alter base fluid culture result indicate . 2 . All patient admit less 48 hour observation index endoscopic procedure . 3 . Enteral nutrition commence within 48 hour procedure via nasogastric tube , PEG-J ( Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube jejunal extension ) , nasojejunal tube surgical/endoscopic jejunostomy prompt transition oral diet unless contraindicate . Route enteral nutrition support determine treat physician . 4 . In plastic stent group , WON irrigate use 250cc normal saline every six hour total duration 48 hour . The nasocystic catheter remove 48 hour . At 48-96 hour post-procedure : 1 . MRI/CECT ( contraindication MRI ) obtain follow criterion meet : . Persistent symptoms abdominal pain , gastric outlet obstruction and/or failure advance diet b . Ongoing SIRS ( Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ) /Sepsis c. Persistent organ failure 2 . If repeat MRI/CECT fail show resolution WON ( define ≥50 % decrease volume ) , repeat intervention perform 3 . The type repeat intervention perform determined treat physician include : 1 . Direct endoscopic necrosectomy ( DEN ) unilocular collection significant solid component 2 . Creation second drainage site and/or DEN multi-loculated/large collection without significant solid component 3 . Placement interventional radiology-guided percutaneous drain collection accessible via stomach/duodenum 4 . Repeat intervention perform frequency determine treat physician volume WON decrease ≥ 50 % clinical improvement , maximum three session . 5 . If still inadequate response treatment ( define ) three endoscopic transmural drainage procedure use designated stent type ( i.e . procedure # 1=stent insertion , procedure # 2-3= insertion stent second drainage site ± direct endoscopic necrosectomy ± percutaneous drain insertion ) , patient define `` endoscopic treatment failure '' . These patient refer minimally invasive surgical debridement WON . 6 . Procedures # 2 3 also undertaken describe patient return hospital period follow discharge index procedure . Pre-discharge : Following information obtain prior discharge : 1 . Symptoms : . Pain b. Nausea/vomiting c. Malaise d. Oral intake ( liquid diet , solid diet , duration tolerance po intake ) 2 .
