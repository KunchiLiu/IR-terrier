	<detailed_description>Patients The study cross-sectional analysis patient hemodialysis patient treat Tungs ' Taichung Metroharbor hospital ( 500 patient ) . Patients ≥20 year age maintenance hemodialysis least 3 month study . The dialysis session 3.5 4.5 h three time per week , blood flow great 300 mL/min , dialysate flow 600 mL/min , bicarbonate buffer . Clinical assessment data collection The investigator collect baseline clinical data [ age , sex , height , bodyweight , clinical etiology Chronic Kidney Disease possible , comorbidities , blood pressure , laboratory measure [ serum creatinine , albumin , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , total cholesterol , complete blood count , total carbon dioxide , anthropometric information various potential indicator PEW [ body mass index , waist/hip ratio , mid-arm circumference ( MAC ) , triceps skinfold thickness ( TSF ) , mid-arm muscle circumference ( MAMC ) , mid-arm muscle area ( MAMA ) , SGA , BIA analyse , hand grip Strength ( HGS ) . For laboratory test , fast blood sample obtain patient perform Department Clinical Pathology investigator hospital mean routine method . Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) tumour necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) level measure via immunometric enzyme immunoassay . Insulin analyze use human ELISA kit . Sensitivity 2.88 pmol/L , upper limit intra- inter-assay coefficient variation 3.3 7.6 , respectively . Homeostatic Model Assessment Insulin Resistance ( HOMA-IR ) calculate fast insulin ( U/l ) × fast glucose ( mg/dl ) /405 , describe Matthews et al . All patient receive echocardiograms study perform within 3 month enrollment , use estimate Congestive Heart Failure ( define ejection fraction &lt; 40 % ) leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH , define left ventricle mass index 125 g/m2 men 100 g/m2 woman ) . Cardiovascular disease define previous history Congestive Heart Failure , LVH , ischemic heart disease ( include prior history angina , myocardial infarction , coronary artery bypass graft percutaneous cardiac catheter intervention ) cerebrovascular disease ( include prior history transient ischemic attack stroke ) . Anthropometric measurement The actual bodyweight height day assessment use . Anthropometric measurement include TSF use skinfold caliper MAC measure stretchable measuring tape , MAMC equal MAC ( centimeter ) -3.14 x TSF ( millimeter ) /10 MAMA equal ( MAMC2/4π ) . Body composition measurement 1 . Bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) device : ( Tanita BC-418 ) Body composition measure use 8-contact electrode bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) device ( Tanita BC-418 , Tanita , Tokyo , Japan ) , well BIS ( FMC ) follow standard procedure manufacturer 's instructions.This BIA device use measure whole body segmental impedance ( ± 1Ω ) frequency 50 kilohertz ( kHz ) , provide valid muscle mass estimate ( kg ) four extremity . Appendicular muscle mass ( ASM ) calculate sum estimate muscle mass arm legs . A relative skeletal muscle mass index ( ASM/ht2 ) normalize height define ratio ASM ( kg ) height square ( m2 ) . For analysis , investigator define muscle mass cut-off point accord distribution ASM/ht2 young population comprise 998 healthy adult ( age 20-40 year ) study population . A participant consider low muscle mass ASM/ht2 −2 standard deviation reference young adult value define previous study ( 6.76 kg/m2 men 5.28 kg/m2 woman ) . 2 . Bioelectric impedance spectroscopy ( BIS ) BIS measurement perform participant enrol study specific member staff complete training course BIS technique , use portable whole body bioimpedance spectroscopy device , body composition monitor ( BCM : Fresenius Medical Care , Bad Homburg , Germany ) . The BCM measure impedance spectroscopy 50 different frequency 5 kHz 1 megahertz ( MHz ) . Measurements take midweek dialysis session start hemodialysis treatment patient calm , supine , relaxed dialysis bed 10 minute . Specific exclusion criterion dictate device include history pacemaker , defibrillator , metallic suture , stent implantation amputation major limb . The device express body weight term lean tissue mass ( LTM - mainly muscle ) , adipose tissue mass ( ATM - mainly fat ) overhydration ( OH ) . Each compartment specific composition contains know quantity water per mass tissue . Overhydration ( OH ) almost 100 % extracellular water , whereas water LTM ATM consist differ proportion extracellular intracellular water addition solid component . Gait speed Participants observe take walk short distance usual pace , start stand position , examiner time task use handheld stopwatch measure near hundredth second . The walk distance range 3 5 accord different study site . The gait speed calculate walk distance ( ) divide time ( ) . The investigator examine distribution gait speed stratify accord sex-specific median height . Participants gait speed low 20 % sex- height-specific distribution consider low gait speed . Handgrip strength Handgrip strength measure non-fistula side dialysis session use mechanical dynamometer precision le 0.5 kg . Subjects instruct self-adjust dynamometer fit comfortably hand size obtain best performance . Before data collection , warm section conduct subject could become acquainted instrument procedure choose best adjustment . Subjects instruct grip dynamometer maximum strength response voice command . The subject stand arm extend sideways body dynamometer face away body . Three trial perform rest period least 1 min trial high HGS value use analysis . Participants handgrip strength low 20 % sex- BMI-specific distribution consider low handgrip strength . Assessments nutritional status potential indicator PEW Subjective Global Assessment ( SGA ) The SGA recommend National Kidney Foundation Kidney / Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative ( K/DOQI ) instrument assess nutritional status dialysis patient . It semiquantitative score system base history physical examination . The history consist five component : weight loss precede 6 month , gastrointestinal symptom , food intake , functional capacity , comorbidities . Each feature score separately A , B , C , reflect well-nourished severely malnourished category . The physical examination consist 2 component : loss subcutaneous fat muscle wasting . These two component classify term three major SGA score : A , well nourish ; B , mild moderate malnutrition ; C , severe malnutrition . Malnutrition-Inflammation Score ( MIS ) MIS score sheet consist four section ( patient 's related medical history , physical examination , body mass index ( BMI ) , laboratory parameter ) 10 component . Patient 's medical history consist five component : dry weight change , dietary intake , gastrointestinal symptom , functional capacity , co-morbidity , include number year dialysis . Major comorbid condition ( MCC ) include congestive heart failure class III IV , , severe coronary artery disease , moderate severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , major neurological sequela , metastatic malignancy status post recent chemotherapy . Physical examination consist two component , aim detect decrease fat store loss subcutaneous fat sign muscle waste . Laboratory parameter serum albumin serum total iron binding capacity ( TIBC ) . Each 10 MIS component classify among four level severity , 0 ( normal ) 3 ( severely abnormal ) . The sum 10 MIS component range 0 ( normal ) 30 ( severely malnourish ) ; high score reflect severe degree malnutrition inflammation . Definitions sarcopenia , obesity , sarcopenic obesity The investigator determine presence sarcopenia accord European Working Group Sarcopenia Older People ( EWGSOP ) consensus definition . A diagnosis sarcopenia require presence low muscle mass addition low handgrip strength slow gait speed . Participants consider severe sarcopenia three criterion present , whereas low muscle mass , without low handgrip strength slow gait speed , consider pre-sarcopenia stage . Obesity define 3 way 1 . Base waist circumference : waist circumference measure mid-level iliac crest low border twelfth rib subject stand foot 25-30 cm apart . A normal WC level men woman define &lt; 90 &lt; 80 cm , respectively . 2 . Based reference value Baumgartner et al . The cut-off point obesity body fat percentage great 60th percentile study sample sex ( 27.82 % men 37.61 % woman ) . 3 . Based BMI : The investigator calculate BMI bodyweight kg divide square height m2 , categorize accord definition Department Health Taiwan ( BMI 24-26.9 kg/m2 overweight BMI ≥27 kg/m2 obesity ) . Sarcopenic obesity characterize high body fat combine low skeletal muscle mass . Class II sarcopenia indicate definition participant whose height- weight-adjusted ASM 2 Standard Deviation ( SD ) . SO considered combination class II sarcopenia obesity accord definition . Covariates The covariates participant 's age , sex , smoke status ( smoker non-smoker ) , comorbidities . Participants report smoke cigarette time interview define smoker . Comorbidities assess refer self-reported physician 's diagnosis , include hypertension , cancer , advance liver disease , diabetes mellitus , stroke , heart failure , arthritis , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .</detailed_description>
