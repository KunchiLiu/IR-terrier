	<detailed_description>Introduction Teaching learn difficult airway management consider essential skill anesthesiology . Assessment train program require currently establish guideline . Recent study reveal management airway sophisticated maneuver anesthesia provider , since relate morbidity mortality circumstance . It appear 6.2 % endotracheal intubation operate theater . In addition , difficult intubation ventilation occur 1.5 % , procedure ; impossible intubation difficult ventilation 0.3 % ; `` ca n't intubate , ca n't ventilate '' ( CICV ) situation , 0.07 % . Normally , anesthesia personnel perform endotracheal intubation general anesthesia . However , occasionally come across difficult airway . This become life- and-death condition may lead uneventful sequela . In practice , difficult airway define either troublesome facemask ventilation tracheal intubation . As result , doctor nurse anesthesia vigilant every step include airway assessment , equipment preparation strategic planning process . In addition , update difficult airway algorithm help manage patient 's airway right time . After graduation , register nurse need spend one year training program become nurse anesthetist , serve either anesthesiologist 's assistant general practitioner 's helper . During one-year training program , nurse anesthetist student intensively study theory practical skill anesthesia , use manikin live patient . However , effective training airway management result learner ' competence diversity teach technique . Currently , educational tool anesthesia curriculum typically simulation-based learning ( SBL ) problem-based learning ( PBL ) course , widely accept many educational institute . They yield promise outcome amongst student professionalism . The SBL provide high-level learning circumstance help student gain experience . The diagnostic feedback system help learner correct mistake confidence . However , PBL allow student present informative knowledge , result retention integration learn clinical experience . In addition , self-directed learn give creative thinking . Instructors act facilitator empower student implement strategic plan learn . Either SBL PBL unique process ass participant ' core knowledge . Furthermore , difficult airway management become distinguish mean train curriculum . As result , design cross-over study determine learn achievement nurse anesthetist student difficult airway management . Objectives To study learn achievement relative growth knowledge two learn technique : SBL PBL . Methods Thirty-six nurse anesthetist student Academic Year 2015 , Department Anesthesiology , Faculty Medicine Siriraj Hospital , Mahidol University , volunteer join study project without honorarium . The benefit take part study knowledge clinical experience gain . The student inform significance research faculty policy well learn objective detail . After sign consent form , randomly put two group : A ( n = 17 ) B ( n = 19 ) . As design cross-over study , student group A attend SBL 6 week , focus PBL , vice versa group B . The PBL learning session comprise four different clinical question together educational resource one hour self-study . Consequently , student spend two hour presentation discussion knowledge information front class . The SBL learning session consist clinical scenario PBL . All learner spend three hour environment well-equipped operating theater standardize patient high-fidelity manikin . Then join debrief forum give attending staff . The 40-item , multiple choice exam develop table specification knowledge map regard difficult airway management guideline . The paper-pencil test comprise evaluation airway , basic preparation difficult airway management , strategy endotracheal intubation extubation , follow care . The correctness appropriateness test ( content validity ) determine three board-certified anesthesiologist least 10 year experience anesthesia involved project . The try test perform 10 novice nurse anesthetist . The index item objective congruence 0.82 Kuder Richardson 21 0.8 . The assessed criterion-referenced item difficulty discrimination index 0.4-0.6 0.6-0.8 respectively . The pretest ( X1 , X2 ) post-test ( ( Y1 , Y2 ) perform consequence . The relative growth knowledge ( G1 , G2 ) calculate follow : G1 = 100 ( Y1 - X1 ) / ( F - X1 ) % G2 = 100 ( Y2 - X2 ) / ( F - X2 ) % Where F full score learn course Statistics analysis The test score relative growth knowledge two group express mean standard deviation . Comparison two group perform repeated measure ANOVA use Statistical Package Social Sciences Windows , release 18 . Statistically significant difference consider p value &lt; 0.05 95 % confidence interval .</detailed_description>
