	<brief_summary>The Investigators propose examine effect lower intraocular pressure macular edema Participants diagnose diabetic macular edema . Our theory base assumption lower intraocular pressure mean high Ocular Perfusion pressure , may cause improvement retinal perfusion thus improvement retinal oxygenation reduce edema</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Relationship Between Intraocular Pressure Macular Edema Patients With Diabetic Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ocular perfusion pressure ( ocular perfusion pressure - OPP ) , consider drive force ocular blood flow . Perfusion pressure define difference artery vein blood pressure . Because ocular venous pressure slightly high IOP ( intra ocular pressure - IOP ) , common estimate OPP difference arterial blood pressure IOP . The OPP critical diffusion oxygen , nutrient metabolic waste retinal imaging , decrease may reduce blood flow eye lead ischemia hypoxia . OPP control complex system Autoregulation . Much write relationship OPP glaucoma , agree OPP low risk factor disease . Diabetic macular edema ( DME ) common cause vision loss develop country working-age . Many study carry recent year attempt good understand pathophysiology Diabetic macular edema , consensus scientific literature hypertension significant effect Diabetic macular edema . relationship much complex seem first glance . Paques team show inverse association blood pressure drop night Diabetic macular edema . LARSEN team show similar trend . Hayreh publish article 2007 , describe mechanism improvement Diabetic macular edema discontinuation hypertensive treatment thereby raise blood pressure . In article , Hayreh describe hypoxia significant factor Diabetic macular edema , demonstrate treatment hypoxia increase OPP bring good result term macular thickness If , seem link level oxygenation retina Diabetic macular edema , improve oxygenation retina could lower level macular edema patient . If way find improve retinal perfusion , may lead improved oxygenation reduce edema . The Investigators propose examine relationship macular edema IOP Participants Diabetic macular edema , think high IOP mean low OPP , mean increase risk develop macular edema Participants group .</detailed_description>
