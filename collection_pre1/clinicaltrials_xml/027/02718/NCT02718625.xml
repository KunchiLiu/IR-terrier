	<brief_summary>This study design compare SANTYL® versus hydrogel ( SoloSite® ) treatment pressure ulcer participant long-term care facility . After meet study criterion , participant randomly assign application SANTYL® SoloSite® pressure ulcer 6 week . A study previously conduct show long-term care setting , removal dead skin ( debridement ) SANTYL® result participant achieve complete debridement , rapidly SoloSite® use . The goal present study confirm result earlier study , demonstrate superior debridement outcome pressure ulcers patient long-term care compare ulcer manage SoloSite® .</brief_summary>
