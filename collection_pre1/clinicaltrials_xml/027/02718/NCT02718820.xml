	<brief_summary>Squamous cell carcinoma head neck , account 90 % head neck cancer , tenth common cancer worldwide 650000 new case per year . The major risk factor HNSCC development comprise alcohol tobacco consumption . During last decade human papilloma virus infection ( HPV ) identify contribute development oropharyngeal HNSCC subgroup patients5 . Standard treatment option include surgery , ( chemo ) radiation chemotherapy . Despite improvement treatment regimens recurrence rate stage III/IV disease curative therapy 30-40 % . In locoregionally unresectable recurrent metastatic disease palliative poly-chemotherapy mainstay therapy.The median survival time patient 6-8 month . Based result EXTREME study combination regimen contain platinum drug , 5 fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) weekly cetuximab become standard care set . For patient , progress platinum base therapy , treatment option scarce . Besides platinum drug , taxanes paclitaxel docetaxel show particular use setting . Apart increase preclinical clinical evidence immune-checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab might play role HNSCC . Thus , aim study test combination docetaxel pembrolizumab platinum failure effective safe regimen .</brief_summary>
