	<brief_summary>With prospective , multicenter trial investigator aim establish Hepatocellular Immune Score ( HCCIS ) , score develop retrospective study , new tool risk stratification patient resection hepatocellular carcinoma widely use clinical practice . The investigator expect show score prognosticator overall survival also disease free survival . Further , demonstrate HCCIS risk stratification tool independent clinical descriptive parameter . Additionally , investigator plan elucidate respective HCCIS risk group different respect immunological infiltration also different respect tumor biology . The finding , tumor respective risk group show different tumor biology lead assumption different therapy strategy need apply . Therefore , translational approach aim build data base HCC tumor organoids test effect CD8+IL-33+ effector-memory cell HCC tumor organoids respective HCCIS risk group .</brief_summary>
