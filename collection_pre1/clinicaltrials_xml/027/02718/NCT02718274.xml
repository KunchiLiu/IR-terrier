	<detailed_description>The aim project investigate incremental cost health benefit add HIVST remit exist cadre community volunteer general population Malawi . Specific objective : 1 . Validate use OraQuick HIVST product rural setting , establish preference social harm report system , conduct baseline survey . 2 . Carry pragmatic cluster-randomised trial ART clinic catchment population , include CBDAs , unit randomisation . 3 . Evaluate impact add HIVST remit VMMC mobilisers demand VMMC 4 . Establish expect cost benefit introduce HIVST Malawi economic mathematical modelling . 5 . Conduct interviews policy-makers prepare national scale-up HIVST support market introduction quality-assured HIVST product . CRCT METHODOLOGY/STUDY DESIGN First stage randomization : HIVST v. SOC . The main study cluster-randomised trial 5 high HIV prevalence district ( provisionally Blantyre , Machinga , Mwanza , Neno Thyolo ) already community-based reproductive health service provide PSI funding provided German Technical Cooperation Agency ( GTZ ) . This programme support volunteer socially-market reproductive child health product village , product store manage collaborate primary care clinic . The unit randomisation Primary Care + ART Clinic surround catchment area village clinic . CBDAs HIVST Arm village train provide HIVST service well reproductive health service . CBDAs SOC Arm village remain reproductive health service . Two separate unit evaluation pre-defined randomisation : one two evaluation village baseline-final household survey , wider catchment area include village CBDA activity . Second stage randomization : HIVST without home assessment . Villages HIVST intervention area randomise either HIVST , HIVST plus offer home assessment HIV care initiation ( first assessment first 14 day HIV care medication ) additional intervention aim facilitating linkage care . CRCT SAMPLE SIZE This trial one primary one secondary outcome , number analysis specify Statistical Analysis Plan . The sample size consideration relate main Primary Outcome ( comparison arm recent HIV testing ) . A survey sample 250 500 adult per cluster provide sufficient power two sample comparison unmatched proportion HTC coverage perform across intervention control arm determine number cluster per arm . The cluster size base typical size rural village ( 250-500 people ) previous experience Malawi . Using 2010 DHS data , baseline rate individual test last 12 month estimate 25 % 40 % , 45 % 60 % predicted effect size intervention arm compare control arm . Baseline coverage individual ever test estimate 42 % 60 % predicted effect size 30 % -45 % . Figures 10 11 full protocol contain table scenario outline assumption . To detect 50 % increase rate people test past 12 month 45 % increase percentage people ever test intervention village , approximately 8 cluster per arm approximately 4,000 participant total . This study aim reach 10 cluster per arm 5,000 participant provide contingency lower anticipated effect size . FORMATIVE RESEARCH Formative research conduct begin cRCT , include ( 1 ) cognitive interview assess suitability exist IFUs population modify IFUs need ; ( 2 ) key informant interview help identify needs stakeholder work area ; ( 3 ) community map identify local service . Cognitive interview validate IFUS . Convenience sample use recruit client VCT clinic cognitive interview . Eligibility criterion include client 16 year old , willing provide write informed consent participation study . A witnessed thumbprint sufficient unable read write . Participants purposively select ensure range location literacy level . Four 12 participant recruit iteration cognitive interview , maximum 12 iteration adaptation trial intend IFUs ( n = 144 ) . Cognitive interview iterative adaptation continue saturation occur modification user material make . Key informant interview . We conduct key informant interview inform understand need key informant interview stakeholder work HIV policy , product regulation HIV implementation . Approximately 45 participant select purposively snowball sample KIIs . MLW-LSHTM , use professional network PSI country staff , identify appropriate stakeholder . Interviews write informed consent , use semi-structured questionnaire audiotaped . Community mapping . Primary care clinic evaluation villager select consultation program lead PSI 's CBDA programme , consultation relevant District Health Offices , Primary care clinic CBDAs themselves.Once village select , preliminary mapping exercise initiate include demarcation village boundary location dwelling geographical position system ( GPS ) brief household-level questionnaire ( name household head , demographic household member ) . PILOT STUDY Two village include main study select rural Blantyre Thyolo pilot study accuracy acceptability . From village , 200 250 participant total recruit either randomly select household ( n = 150-200 ) community peer group ( n = 48 ) accuracy acceptability study .Participants opt self-test well undergo standard HTC give HIVST kit test result form record reading result . They provide demonstration instruction carry self-test procedure private room complete test result form . Participants recognise make user error find first result uninterpretable give second test kit repeat procedure wish . Following self-testing , trained HTC counsellor record read test kit complete standard HTC process ( parallel Unigold Determine finger prick blood ) enter result blood-based test . All patient test HIV+ve refer HIV care service . PILOT STUDY SAMPLE SIZE For pilot study , 150 200 adult recruit random selection 60 80 household ( estimate 2-5 adult per household ) use randomly select GPS waypoints . All household member age 16 year old ask write consent answer brief questionnaire ( socio demographic , past HIV test experience , chronic care include ART ) offer HIVST follow immediately confirmatory HTC . Parental consent take 16 17-year-olds witness thumbprint individual unable read write .</detailed_description>
