	<brief_title>Trial Evaluate Safety Immunogenicity Ebola Zaire Vaccine Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ebola Zaire filovirus cause devastate epidemic hemorrhagic fever South Africa . Research underway create safe effective vaccine protect Ebola disease , especially military health care worker . Promising animal study vaccine indicate safety immunogenicity , vaccine platform use deliver Ebola protein antigen successful create safe protective immune response people . Note one Ebola protein use vaccine ; since entire intact Ebola virus require infection , impossible get Ebola disease vaccine . The study target enrollment 39 healthy adult . These participant divide 3 group administer one three dose level vaccine ( low , medium , high ) . The study participant receive two dos vaccine : one day 1 second day 28 ( 1 month ) . Three participant dose level act control receive placebo instead active vaccine . A total 13 visit clinic required period 26 week . The total study expect take 9 month .</detailed_description>
