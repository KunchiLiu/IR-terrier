	<brief_title>3 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Treatment Pain From Bone Metastases Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single centre , single arm , non-randomized , non-blinded study . All eligible subject receive MR-HIFU therapy , blind necessary . All patient receive one session MR-HIFU treatment Philips Sonalleve MR-HIFU device painful bone metastasis . Will enrol study consecutive patient painful skeletal metastasis solid tumour . Patients severity grade pain ( mild , moderate severe pain ) include study . At HIFU day ( day 0 ) treatment patient perform bone lesion MRI functional brain MRI . The functional brain MRI clinical practice : dangerous patient , involve long time exam patient MRI site . A Brief Pain Inventory , EORTC-quality life questionnaire-C15-paired-associate learning information pain medication record collect always treatment . During treatment procedure , intravenous catheter deliver MR contrast medium medication ( sedation analgesic require ) within MR room . The body temperature patient measure prior procedure . In MR room patient lie still HIFU patient table inside MRI magnet . The operator locate target tissue mark volume treat use MRI image . The operator start treatment monitor progress treatment MR thermal dose map accord Sonalleve Instructions Use ensure safety . Following MR-HIFU procedure , set MR image target region acquire use MR contrast agent , together functional brain MRI . The functional brain MRI clinical practice : dangerous patient , involve long time exam patient MRI tunnel . Patients return follow-up appointment Day 14 , 30 , 60 90 clinical examination . Clinical examination include inspection palpation treat area assessment functionality ( e.g . walk pattern range movement ) . The Brief Pain Inventory EORTC-quality life questionnaire also administer ( complete patient ) , pain medication usage possible adverse event record . Additionally , bone MRI treat site functional brain MRI image acquire 30 90 day treatment . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS To calculate sample size optimal two-stage design develop Simon use ( Richard Simon , Controlled Clinical Trials 1989 ) . Considering 2 stage study , difference p1-p0=20 % standard treatment ( p0=40 % ) investigate treatment ( p1=60 % ) set alfa error probability 0.10 beta error probability 0.10 , 28 patient treat 1st stage trial . If less equal 11 response observe among 28 patient , study stop . Otherwise study continue total 41 patient treated second stage . If 20 response 41 patient second stage , treatment could consider active . The Intent-to-treat ( ITT ) population define population enrol patient . The per-protocol population consider patient ITT population except prove non eligible enrollment , withdraw MR-HIFU treatment commit major protocol violation . The safety population consider patient ITT population underwent MR-HIFU treatment .</detailed_description>
