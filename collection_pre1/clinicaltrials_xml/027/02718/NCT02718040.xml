	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Key 1 . Seeking correction bilateral NLFs : severe ( i.e. , bilateral WSRS = 34 ) moderate ( i.e. , bilateral WSRS = 23 ) AND bilateral MLs : severe ( i.e. , WAS = 34 ) moderate ( i.e. , WAS = 23 ) . 2 . Subjects childbearing potential agree use medically accept method contraception study 30 day follow study completion . 3 . Intent undergo optimal correction bilateral NLFs MLs . Optimal correction define best possible aesthetic outcome agree treat investigator subject . Key 1 . Subject present severity wrinkle fold require treatment , e.g . laser treatment , chemical peeling , achieve optimal correction . 2 . Previous facial surgery , include aesthetic facial surgical therapy , liposuction tattoo , treatment area . 3 . Previous tissue augment therapy contour permanent nonpermanent filler fatinjection facial area . 4 . Previous tissue revitalization treatment neurotoxin facial area within 6 month treatment . 5 . Known/previous allergy hypersensitivity injectable hyaluronic acid ( HA ) gel . 6 . Known/previous allergy hypersensitivity local anaesthetic , e.g . lidocaine amidetype anaesthetic . 7 . Known/previous allergy hypersensitivity grampositive bacterial protein . 8 . Any medical condition , opinion treat investigator , would make subject unsuitable inclusion ( e.g . chronic , relapse hereditary disease may interfere outcome study ) . 9 . Other condition prevent subject enter study treat investigator 's opinion , e.g . subject likely avoid facial cosmetic treatment , subject anticipate unreliable , unavailable incapable understanding study assessment unrealistic expectation treatment result .</criteria>
