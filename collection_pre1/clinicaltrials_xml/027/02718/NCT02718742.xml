	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation After Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy Surgery Treating Patients With High-Risk Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate patient high risk urothelial carcinoma treat cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow curative intent cystectomy receive maintenance therapy paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ( nab-paclitaxel ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) , time progression duration response patient treat cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow curative intent cystectomy receive maintenance therapy nab-paclitaxel . II . To evaluate adverse event associate use single agent nab-paclitaxel ( AbraxaneÂ® ) patient high risk urothelial carcinoma receive maintenance therapy III . To evaluate Health Related Quality life ( HRQoL ) assess European Organization Research Treatment Care ( EORTC ) QLQ-C30 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine presence circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) high risk patient urothelial carcinoma prior initiation maintenance therapy ( baseline ) nab-paclitaxel exposure ( cycle 2 , 4 ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
