	<brief_summary>This multi-center prospective observational study capture detail information treatment long term outcomes 450 patient PNI result upper extremity trauma . The study focus young adult population include individual age 18-54 . Patients PNI recruit hospitalization initial treatment upper extremity injury . Additional patient may identify clinic visit on-going treatment upper extremity injury nerve injury evolve upon referral outside physician . However , eligible nerve injury must diagnose within 30 day initial upper extremity trauma . Outcomes assess 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month follow diagnosis nerve injury . All assessment take place clinic include patient interview brief exam evaluate sensory motor function .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Ages 1854 2 . Sustained peripheral nerve injury ( include iatrogenic injury partial nerve injury ) result upper extremity trauma involve injury dysfunction motor , motor sensory function axillary , radial , median , ulnar , musculocutaneous nerve injury localize distal brachial plexus cord level proximal distal flexion crease wrist involve `` mixed '' nerve segment ( i.e . involve location specify nerve expect sensory motor axon present ) include sensory distal termination nerve . 3 . Nerve injury diagnose within 30 day initial upper extremity trauma 1 . Closed injury undergo surgical exploration within 30 day injury 2 . Injuries brachial plexus root , trunk , division cord 3 . Injuries nerve distal distal flexion crease wrist 4 . Injuries involve distal extension parent nerve consider sensory ( superficial radial nerve , lateral ante brachial cutaneous nerve , etc ) 5 . Previous motor sensory deficit prior injury ( e.g . result trauma , stroke , muscular , neurologic , neuromuscular disorder , etc . ) 6 . Documented psychiatric disorder limit ability consent maintain followup 7 . Unable speak either English Spanish 8 . Severe problem maintain follow ( e.g patient prisoner homeless time injury intellectually challenge without adequate family support ) .</criteria>
