	<brief_summary>Investigators hypothesize impact surgery term induce hypercoagulable state evident morbidly obese pregnant woman oppose non-obese counterpart . The aim study investigate change coagulation status morbidly obese non-obese pregnant woman follow cesarean section delivery use thromboelastometry . This observational study would also make possible calculate sample size future prospective control clinical trial compare incidence Hypercoagulability morbidly obese parturients oppose non-obese counterpart . To best knowledge , work do area .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detecting Hypercoagulability Morbidly Obese Non Obese Parturients Following Cesarean Section Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following institutional ethical committee approval , 20 morbidly obese ( BMI &gt; 40 ) 20 non-obese ( BMI &lt; 30 ) parturients undergo elective low segment cesarean section ( LSCS ) delivery spinal subarachnoid block recruit study . A write informed consent obtain parturients prior inclusion . All patient receive information sheet preoperative assessment visit inform study . Patients history past current thromboembolism exclude study well liver disease already anticoagulant/anti-platelet therapy repeat miscarriage indication . History thromboembolism define arterial deep venous thrombosis , catheter thrombosis , pulmonary embolism diagnose ultrasound spiral compute tomography ( CT ) . Preoperative baseline full blood count clot profile do . Parturients abnormal platelet count coagulation result need conversion general anesthesia exclude . Data sample collection Preoperative BMI , co-existing morbidity laboratory test result include INR , PTT platelet count well operative time postoperative clinical radiological evidence thromboembolism record . A blood sample collect ROTEM analysis prior establish block ( baseline ) , immediately surgery 8 hour later . ROTEM analysis Coagulability assess use ROTEM thromboelastometry analyzer ( The ROTEM® delta , Tem Systems Inc.® , Munich , Germany ) . Extrinsic rotational thromboelastometry ( EXTEM ) , intrinsic rotational thromboelastometry ( INTEM ) FIBTEM measure blood sample . Clotting time ( CT ) , clot formation time ( CFT ) maximum clot firmness ( MCF ) record . Total clot strength assess `` G '' value calculate accord formula : ( 5000xMCF ) /100-MCF express dynes/cm2 . G show valuable diagnose hypo- hypercoagulability . In non-obstetric cohort , hypercoagulability define G value ≥ 11.7 dynes/cm2 hypocoagulability G value &lt; 5.0 dynes/cm2 ( value provide manufacturer ) .</detailed_description>
