	<brief_title>A Study Elotuzumab With Pomalidomide , Bortezomib , Dexamethasone Relapsed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study phase II clinical trial , investigator study safety response rate combination elotuzumab , pomalidomide , bortezomib , dexamethasone ( elo-PVD ) . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve drug elotuzumab , pomalidomide , bortezomib , dexamethasone treatment option Refractory relapse multiple myeloma . Pomalidomide drug change enhance suppress immune system reaction stimulus.This change may help body destroy tumor cell . Bortezomib inhibitor target cell dispose unneeded protein . By block process , bortezomib help destroy unwanted cell . Dexamethasone steroid , help prevent inflammation wide variety organ act myeloma cell . Elotuzumab monoclonal antibody , Elotuzumab target protein highly common surface multiple myeloma cell call SLAMF7 . The combination drug may provide unique approach treat disease .</detailed_description>
