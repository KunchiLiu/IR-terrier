	<detailed_description>The objective study determine impact interferon-free treatment hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) peripheral blood immune cell phenotype soluble immune-related protein blood , control genetic polymorphism know impact HCV-related immune response , determine impact therapy emergence drug-resistant HCV . The study design inform researcher ' recent investigation patient receive HCV treatment . About 4 % patient undergone liver transplantation experience hepatic decompensation another serious event . There several case bacterial infection two case elevate marker autoimmune process . These event suggest treatment alter immune response . About 25 % patient undergone liver transplantation experience hepatic decompensation another serious adverse event . The long term goal understand pathophysiology complication determine whether HCV treatment cause immune reconstitution syndrome susceptible patient , improve antimicrobial defense others The main questions/objectives address ( 1 ) determine effect HCV treatment profile immune cell blood assess cytometry time flight ( CyTOF ) multiparameter analysis , control genetic polymorphism know associated HCV-related immune response , ( 2 ) determine effect treatment factors/proteins blood may relate immunity inflammation . Background : New treatment HCV significantly effective past treatment . They utilize direct act antiviral drug ( DAA ) many include interferon . The goal treatment achieve sustain virological response ( SVR ) . An SVR indicate absence detectable HCV RNA blood 12 week end treatment ( EOT ) ; call SVR12 . The researcher recently investigate outcome 514 non-liver transplant ( LT ) patient 43 LT patient initiate treatment Dec 2013 June 2014 . Several patient develop increased level marker autoimmune process and/or experienced bacterial infection . Investigators institution recently report evidence DAA treatment enhances immune cell activation . The combination investigator ' observation observation others indicate detailed investigation need understand event lead increase immune cell activity determine factor may increase risk serious adverse event .</detailed_description>
