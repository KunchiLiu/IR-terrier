	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn use radiation therapy help control cancer disease gotten bad receive immunotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Salvage Radiation Therapy Induce Systemic Disease Regression After Progression Systemic Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups Radiation Therapy : If find eligible take part study , receive radiation therapy . The radiation oncologist decide type radiation receive . Depending type radiation choose , may receive radiation anywhere 4 day 3 week . The study doctor discus type radiation often receive . Within 7 day begin radiation therapy , radiation simulation plan radiation treatment . During radiation simulation , go motion receive radiation ( though receive radiation ) help understand radiation process . This also help doctor know `` aim '' radiation receive radiation . This may take 1 hour . Study Visits : At start radiation therapy every 4-12 week study : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You MRI , CT , PET/CT scan . You scan day receive radiation therapy . Length Study : You may receive radiation 3 week . However , continue study visit every 4-12 week . You continue study visit unless disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete follow-up visit 1 year . End-of-Study Visit : About 30 day study stops decide withdraw study , physical exam ask side effect may change medication . If come MD Anderson visit , member study staff call . This call last 10 minute . Follow-Up : About every 12 week 1 year , ask side effect may medical history record . If come MD Anderson visit , member study staff call . This call last 10 minute . After 1 year follow , continue follow-up part standard care ( collect information side effect may medical history ) . If follow-up another hospital , information medical history , physical exam , lab test , PET , MRI , CT scan sent MD Anderson review . This investigational study . Radiation therapy deliver use FDA approve commercially available method . It consider investigational use radiation therapy patient whose disease gotten bad receive immunotherapy . The study doctor explain radiation therapy design work . Up 150 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

Demonstrate adequate organ function define , screen lab perform within 28 day prior study registration : *Hematological : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; /=1,000 /mcL ; Platelets &gt; /=50,000 / mcL ; Hemoglobin &gt; /=9 g/dL &gt; /=5.6 mmol/L ; *Renal : Serum creatinine &lt; /=1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) measure calculated creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ( Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) also use place creatinine CrCl ) &gt; /=40 mL/min creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) use CockcroftGault Formula . *Hepatic : Serum total bilirubin &lt; /=1.5 X ULN ( except subject Gilbert Syndrome , may total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dl ) Direct bilirubin &lt; /= ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 X ULN ; aspartate aminotransferase ( AST SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT SGPT ) &lt; /= 3 X ULN &lt; /= 5 X ULN subject liver metastasis 9 . For list standard care indication clinical trial enroll patient please refer protocol . 10 . Female subject childbearing potential negative urine serum pregnancy within 28 day prior study registration first fraction radiation . *Note : If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . 11 . We allow prior radiation site , washout period , prior study entry long high dose region prior propose radiation field overlap . 1 . Has diagnosis active scleroderma , lupus , rheumatologic disease opinion treat radiation oncologist precludes safe radiation therapy . 2 . Has prior radiation therapy within past 3 month high dose area prior radiation would overlap high dose area intend radiation base judgment treat radiation oncologist . 3 . Has recover ( i.e. , &lt; /= Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previous treatment . *Note : Subjects permanent &lt; /= Grade 2 toxicity ( e.g . neuropathy ) toxicity correct routine medical management ( e.g . thyroid replacement hypothyroidism ) exception criterion may qualify study . **Note : If subject receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . ***Note : Subjects asymptomatic &lt; /= Grade 2 laboratory dermatologic abnormality exception criterion may qualify study pending judgment treat radiation oncologist . 4 . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin , indolent lymphoma , situ cervical cancer undergone potentially curative therapy . 5 . Has active infection require intravenous systemic therapy hospital admission . 6 . Has know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . 7 . Is pregnant expect conceive within project duration trial , start screen visit 60 day last fraction radiation . 8 . Is currently receive active treatment anticancer systemic chemotherapy , investigational agent , biological therapy .</criteria>
