	<detailed_description>The gastric cancer second frequently diagnose cancer third lead cause cancer death China.80 % -90 % patient detect middle later stage.The five-year survival rate advance gastric cancer patient less 10 % due shortage effective treatment method.The five-year survival rate early gastric cancer patient beyond 90 % .The reason poor diagnosis treatment current method achieve diagnosis early gastric cancer.Endoscopy biopsy still main method confirm gastric cancer.But limit identify early gastric cancer lead low diagnostic rate early gastric cancer . Accurate diagnosis early gastric cancer pretherapeutic estimation invasion depth desire determine suitable treatment.Presently , endoscopic submucosal dissection new effective minimally invasive treatment early gastric cancer , preserve entire stomach improve patient 's postoperative quality life.But estimation invasion depth gastric cancer confirm operation . Recently , research suggest narrow band image endoscopy ultrasonography consider establish mean diagnosis early gastric cancer depth.No formal quantitative review available evidence publish narrow band image endoscopy ultrasonography could accurately diagnose early gastric cancer evaluate invasive depth.This mean still great limitations.The sensitivity narrow band image diagnosis 60 % high false positive rate , short wavelength light penetration , result influence histologic variety early gastric cancer inflammatory change background mucosa ; Although endoscopy ultrasonography achieve diagnostic accuracy 80 % , tomographic view facilitate objective assessment , occasionally difficult obtain image adequate quality , evaluation highly dependent operator ' proficiency level . Infrared endoscopic image new great potential method diagnosis early gastric cancer , since first report 1990 , people explore field . Through intravenous injection exogenous contrast medium , indocyanine green , make mucosal lesion highlight , avoids interference background light.If specific target molecular link contrast medium , specific image lesion present . What , due strong penetration power infrared light , image depth also increase significantly.Indocyanine green also demonstrate safe clinical study widely use , assessment liver function test . At present , research aspect , clinical research result show infrared endoscopic image large value differentiate early gastric cancer gastric adenoma , difference early gastric cancer gastric lesion significantly correlate depth cancer invasion . However , system research infrared image characteristic gastric cancer different precancerous status , infrared endoscopic image assessment criterion diagnosis gastric cancer . Recently , investigator complete experiment animal infrared imaging , result prove good specificity identify tumor lesion . On basis , investigator apply research near-infrared endoscopy diagnose early gastric cancer , discuss feasibility infrared endoscopy diagnose early gastric cancer clinical value .</detailed_description>
