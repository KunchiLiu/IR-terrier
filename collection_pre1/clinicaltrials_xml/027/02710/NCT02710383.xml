	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis inherit disease characterize buildup thick , sticky mucus damage many body 's organ . The disorder 's common sign symptom include progressive damage respiratory system chronic digestive system problem . The feature disorder severity vary among affected individual . Mucus slippery substance lubricate protects lining airway , di-gestive system , reproductive system , organs tissue . In people cystic fibrosis , body produce mucus abnormally thick sticky . This abnormal mucus clog airway , lead severe problem breathe bacterial in-fections lung . These infection cause chronic coughing , wheeze , inflamma-tion . Over time , mucus buildup infection result permanent lung damage , include formation scar tissue ( fibrosis ) cysts lung . Most people cystic fibrosis also digestive problem . Some affected baby meconium ileus , blockage intestine occur shortly birth . Other di-gestive problem result buildup thick , sticky mucus pancreas . The pan-creas organ produce insulin ( hormone help control blood sugar level ) . It also make enzymes help digest food . In people cystic fibrosis , mucus block ducts pancreas , reduce production insulin prevent digestive enzyme reach intestine aid digestion . Problems digestion lead diarrhea , malnutrition , poor growth , weight loss . In adolescence adulthood , shortage insulin cause form diabetes know cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus ( CFRDM ) . Cystic fibrosis use consider fatal disease childhood . With improved treat-ments well way manage disease , many people cystic fibrosis live well adulthood . Adults cystic fibrosis experience health problem affect respiratory , digestive , reproductive system . Most men cystic fibrosis con-genital bilateral absence va deferens ( CBAVD ) , condition tube carry sperm ( vas deferens ) block mucus develop properly . Men CBAVD unable father child ( infertile ) unless undergo fertility treatment . Women cystic fibrosis may experience complication pregnancy . What gene relate cystic fibrosis ? Mutations CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis . The CFTR gene provide instruction make channel transport negatively charge particle call chloride ion cell . Chloride component sodium chloride , common salt find sweat . Chloride also important function cell ; example , flow chloride ion help control movement water tissue , necessary produc-tion thin , freely flow mucus . Mutations CFTR gene disrupt function chloride channel , prevent regulate flow chloride ion water across cell membrane . As result , cell line passageways lung , pancreas , organ produce mucus unusually thick sticky . This mucus clog airways various duct , cause characteristic sign symptom cystic fibrosis . Other genetic environmental factor likely influence severity condition . For example , mutation gene CFTR might help explain people cystic fibrosis severely affect others . Most genetic change identify , however . New method , like mass-spectrometry give good chance characterize specific metabolic alteration blood ( plasma ) affect patient allow diagnose future disease earlier , high sensitivity specificity . Therefore goal study identify validate new biochemical marker plasma affect patient help benefit patient early diagnose thereby earlier treatment .</detailed_description>
