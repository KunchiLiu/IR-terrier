	<detailed_description>National immunization coverage consistently fall short Healthy People 2010 2020 goal remain relatively stagnant past year many immunization . One important group high risk under-immunization child chronic medical condition ( CMCs ) , also increase risk serious morbidity even death vaccine preventable disease . One key intervention improve immunization coverage general population child CMCs decrease miss opportunity immunization . Immunization reminders electronic health record ( EHR ) type clinical decision support ( CDS ) reduce miss opportunity . In recent project , investigator successfully employ reminder increase influenza immunization . One limitation EHR immunization reminder generally act local EHR immunization data . If data incomplete , provider may erroneously alert order immunization child need . The likelihood incomplete local data high . Nearly one-quarter child U.S. visit one immunization provider first three year life , lead fragmented incomplete record . Low-income minority child especially susceptible immunization record fragmentation likely receive care multiple clinic provider . Children CMCs also high-risk since care often share primary care provider subspecialists.Harnessing Immunization Information Systems ( IIS ) data help overcome limitation . IIS population-based system collect immunization data primarily child adolescents provider regional state level , consolidate patient 's immunization data single location matter administer . There currently IIS 50 state , five city , District Columbia . However , case , IIS data available provider IIS 's website . Yet , frontline care provider likely benefit IIS provide information point patient care within EHR workflow . This type bidirectional exchange immunization information IIS EHR system propose Stage 3 Meaningful Use objective ; consolidate data would complete data use EHR reminder , rarely use . Another challenge associate EHR-based immunization reminder pediatric adolescent immunization schedule complex , require 35 immunization plus annual influenza vaccine . Each immunization series minimum age dosing interval , new immunization uncommon . However , many EHRs may aggressively maintain comprehensive immunization decision rule . IIS help overcome limitation well . Many include tool forecast dos next due provide information data exchange EHR , assess . Bringing IIS immunization data forecasting tool local EHR power CDS helpful general population . However , one limitation immunization CDS , whether provide IIS native EHR , account subtlety require child certain CMCs may need extra immunization specific condition receive certain immunization . A logical next-step couple exchange IIS immunization data forecasting tool patient-level EHR information regard medical condition power accurate , patient-specific EHR immunization reminder . This yet do . Aim 1 : Assess impact EHR reminder integrate immunization data forecast regional IIS receipt generally recommend immunization low-income , urban , pediatric adolescent population . Aim 2 : Assess impact integrate EHR reminder also incorporate patient 's medical condition receipt immunization specifically recommend child adolescent chronic medical condition . Hypothesis 1 : Lower rate under-immunization observed reminder 'on ' vs. 'off ' . Hypothesis 2 : Lower rate over-immunization observed reminder 'on ' vs. 'off ' . Hypothesis 3 : Higher rate capture opportunity observe reminder 'on ' vs. 'off ' . Hypothesis 4 : There difference reminder impact generally recommend immunization child without chronic medical condition ( CMCs ) In three-year project , investigator conduct randomize cluster crossover pragmatic clinical trial ass immunization outcomes period integrate immunization reminder 'on ' vs. 'off ' generally recommended immunization well one specific child CMCs . The proposed work generate empiric knowledge regard best practice implement IIS-supported immunization reminder child without CMCs . The result may help guide local national effort immunization data exchange EHR reminder .</detailed_description>
