	<detailed_description>Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis ( PrEP ) biological efficacy reduce risk HIV acquisition clinical effectiveness strongly influence patient adherence , turn influence social behavioral factor . Trials conduct among serodiscordant heterosexual African couple engage supportive romantic partnership find PrEP highly effective HIV prevention . In contrast , study socially marginalize population Latin America without strong interpersonal support network , transgender woman ( TW ) , find substantially low level adherence , result , effectiveness . We believe new , social network-based strategy promote PrEP adherence , couple behavioral intervention minimize risk compensation , critical control spread HIV among TW Latin America . TW Peru high risk HIV infection ( 30-33 % HIV prevalence ) urgent need new approach prevention adequately address HIV risk part life context . Due social economic marginalization lack support traditional neighborhood family network , TW frequently neglect traditional approach HIV/STI prevention develop men sex men ( MSM ) , report high rate compensate sex , unprotected intercourse , sexually transmit infection ( STI ) co-infections . Despite socially marginalize status , community TW Lima frequently connect dense social geographic network provide support outside traditional community system , disseminate new information idea , define maintain standard behavior . While social network provide critical framework dissemination maintenance TW community norm , previously use framework HIV prevention . We propose social network-based PrEP adherence intervention part comprehensive , context-specific approach HIV prevention TW Lima , Peru . In order effective , PrEP-based prevention strategy need address biological efficacy , also individual behavioral decision-making process , interpersonal partnership context risk , peer norm sexual behavior PrEP adherence , structural access prevention technology . Using health promotion behavioral model combine Social Action Theory social network theory information dissemination collective behavior change , propose develop refine network-based intervention promotes PrEP adherence exist social network TW . Formative research outline individual , partner-level , network-based context sexual risk behavior , pattern social network interaction , anticipate adoption use new prevention technology , optimal content PrEP adherence intervention . Findings use define element prevention intervention use social network TW social medium technology generate , implement , reinforce social norm PrEP adherence risk behavior reduction TW . Aim 1 . To conduct open evaluation social network-based PrEP adherence intervention TW Peru . The intervention pilot group 10-15 TW recruit social network within single geographic area . Using dynamic process implementation , refinement , re-implementation 6-month period , assess acceptability feasibility specific intervention evaluation component . Data use finalize study design , intervention manual , quantitative assessment tool pilot randomize control trial . Aim 2 . To conduct pilot RCT social network-based PrEP adherence intervention TW Peru . The investigator plan enroll 6 social network cluster TW ( 3 cluster per arm , recruit 2 seed match 3 geographical area Lima , Peru ) ( total N=90 TW enrol [ 15 TW per cluster ] achieve least N=60 TW completers [ 10 TW per cluster ] ) randomize participate either network-based PrEP adherence intervention control intervention . The primary outcome adherence PrEP ( measure via laboratory analysis presence detectable drug serum , laboratory analysis presence detectable drug hair , participant self-report ) . The major secondary outcome behavioral risk compensation , specifically degree participant two arm modify HIV risk behavior take PrEP . Behavioral biological assessment conduct Baseline , 3-month , 6-month interval .</detailed_description>
