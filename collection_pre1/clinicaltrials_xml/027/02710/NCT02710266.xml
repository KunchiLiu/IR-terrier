	<brief_summary>Liver resection primary treatment option lesion find liver . With improvement surgical technique perioperative patient management , morbidity mortality relate liver resection greatly reduce . However , many patient hepatocellular carcinoma underlie liver disease . Severity underlie liver disease play important role decision make resection extent . Therefore , liver failure decrease liver function follow liver resection still remain critical issue . Postresection liver failure generally define serum total bilirubin great 3mg/dL prothrombin time le 50 % normal ( INR &gt; 1.7 ) . Pathophysiology postresection liver failure yet well know . However , sepsis liver resection , small-for-size syndrome ( SFSS ) , ischemia/reperfusion injury know important role persistant liver injury resection . After liver resection , kupffer cell drastically decrease innate immunity patient also damage . This process cause patient vulnerable infection . In addition , continuous endotoxin secretion , dysfunction kupffer cell trigger liver regeneration affect . Complex mechanisms lead dysfunctional kupffer cell apoptosis necrosis hepatocytes mediate neutrophil , complement , reactive oxygen specie , acute inflammatory cytokine . Recent study report many promising effect synthetic protease inhibitor , Gabexate mesilate . These include antioxidant effect , inhibition acute inflammatory cytokine reaction , anticoagulatory property . Based effect , synthetic protease inhibitor gain attention role hepatocyte protection liver resection . Currently , report hepatocyte protective effect Gabexate Mesilate ischemia/reperfusion injury cause Pringle maneuver . However , advance surgical technique equipment , many surgeon perform liver resection without Pringle maneuver . Therefore , study design determine effect Gabexate Mesilate liver resection perform without Pringle maneuver .</brief_summary>
