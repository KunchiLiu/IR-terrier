	<brief_summary>In Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD ) imbalance level calcium sodium muscle cell think important damage occur overtime . Sodium/proton type 1 exchanger ( NHE-1 ) inhibition innovative pathway prove efficiently prevent accumulation muscle damage ( inflammation fibrosis ) animal model muscular dystrophy heart failure . Based prior safety efficacy result animal human , NHE-1 inhibition Rimeporide represent new therapeutic approach restriction age genetic subtypes could combine treatment restore augment dystrophin.This study examines safety tolerability effect muscle rimeporide , patient age 6 14 year Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design phase Ib , multicenter , european , open label study evaluate safety tolerability biomarkers new drug , rimeporide , boys age 6 14 year Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD ) . Rimeporide take orally 4 week , three time day . Dose adapt body weight . The study enrol 20 patient DMD , age 6 14 year . 4 dose level test , 4 different cohort 5 patient take drug dose level . During study , 6 visit Hospital maximum 10 week . At visit , patient undergo safety examination include vital sign , physical neurological examination , ECG , safety hematology , biochemistry urinalysis , concomitant treatment review , symptoms side effect review . In addition , blood sample withdraw evaluation Rimeporide plasma . Finally , additional blood &amp; urine sample collect explore efficacy marker . Patients also undergo 2 NMR ( screen End study ) develop non invasive biomarkers investigation DMD patient . The decision progress next high dose make safety tolerability data review precede dose 5 patient SMC determine safe proceed next dose level .</detailed_description>
