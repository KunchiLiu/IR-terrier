	<brief_title>A Clinical Research CD20-Targeted CAR-T B Cell Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The anti-CD20 antibody broadly use treatment B cell malignancy exhibit good clinical outcome . The CD19-targeted CAR-T show exellent therapeutic efficiency B cell malignancy , especially acute lymphocytic leukemia . However , patient treat CD19-targeted CAR-T may face relapse CD19 mutation . Other target aim CAR-T need . Therefore construct CD20-targeted CAR-T cell hope start clinicaltrial explore therapeutic effect CD20-targeted CAR-T cell treatment B cell malignancy .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . CD20expressing B cell malignancy must assure must relapse refractory disease least one standard chemotherapy one salvage regimen . According current traditional therapy , must available alternative curative therapy subject must either ineligible allogeneic stem cell transplant ( SCT ) , refuse SCT , disease activity prohibit SCT time . 2 . Patients enrol must evaluate score 60 KPS . 3 . CD20 expression malignant cell must detect immunohistochemistry flow cytometry . In general immunohistochemistry use lymph node biopsy , flow cytometry use peripheral blood bone marrow sample . 4 . Gender limit , age 14 year 75 year . 5 . Patients must measurable evaluable disease time enrollment , may include evidence disease include minimal residual disease detect flow cytometry , cytogenetics , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analysis . 6 . Patients expect survive 3 month physician time enrollment . 7 . Adequate absolute CD3 count estimate need assure obtain target cell dose base dosage cohort . 8 . Subjects follow CNS status eligible absence neurologic symptom suggestive CNS leukemia , cranial nerve palsy : CNS 1 , define absence blast cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) cytospin preparation , regardless number WBCs ; CNS 2 , define presence &lt; 5/uL WBCs CSF cytospin positive blast , &gt; 5/uL WBCs negative Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm CNS3 marrow disease fail salvage systemic intensive IT chemotherapy ( therefore eligible radiation ) 9 . Patients isolated CNS relapse eligible previously treat cranial radiation ( least 1800 cGy ) . 10 . Ability give inform consent . 11 . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test potentially dangerous effect fetus . 12 . Cardiac function : Left ventricular ejection fraction great equal 40 % MUGA cardiac MRI , fractional shortening great equal 28 % ECHO leave ventricular ejection fraction great equal 50 % ECHO . 13 . Renal function : Creatinine level peripheral blood require great 133umol/L . 14 . Patients history allogeneic stem cell transplantation eligible evidence active GVHD longer take immunosuppressive agent least 30 day prior enrollment . 15 . Patients volunteer participate research . Subjects meet follow criterion eligible participation study : 1 . Patients evaluate 60 score KPS . 2 . Evident sign suggest patient potentially allergic cytokine . 3 . Frequent infection history recent infection uncontrolled . 4 . Patients concomitant genetic syndrome : patient Down syndrome , Fanconi anemia , Kostmann syndrome , Shwachman syndrome know bone marrow failure syndrome 5 . Active acute chronic graftversushost disease ( GVHD ) requirement immunosuppressant medication GVHD within 4 week enrollment . 6 . Concurrent use systemic steroid chronic use immunosuppressant medication . Recent current use inhale steroid exclusionary . For additional detail regard use steroid immunosuppressant medication . 7 . Pregnancy nursing female . 8 . HIV infection . 9 . Active hepatitis B active hepatitis C. 10 . Participation prior investigational study within 4 week prior enrollment longer required local regulation . Participation nontherapeutic research study allow . 11 . Class III/IV cardiovascular disability accord New York Heart Association Classification . 12 . Patients known history prior diagnosis serious immunologic , malignant inflammatory disease . 13 . Other situation think eligible participation research .</criteria>
