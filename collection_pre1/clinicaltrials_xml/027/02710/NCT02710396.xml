	<brief_summary>The primary objective determine tumor genetics ( non-synonymous mutation burden &gt; 200 mutation mutational smoking signature [ transversion high ] ) predict durable clinical benefit ( DCB ) pembrolizumab . The secondary objective determine combine genetic immune ( PD-L1 , immune signature ) analysis predict durable clinic benefit well either test alone . The exploratory objective identify validate candidate neoantigens vitro ; explore mechanism resistance pembrolizumab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-arm , multi-center , open-label , biomarker trial pembrolizumab patient advance solid tumor restrict tumor type know relationship smoke carcinogen exposure ( NSCLC , SCLC , HPV negative head neck cancer , esophageal cancer bladder cancer ) . Pembrolizumab administer experimental treatment total 5 core biopsy collect . Somatic mutation lead cancer relate endogenous exogenous DNA damaging process . The resultant mutation separate two category - ( ) mutation provide selective advantage clonal expansion ( ii ) mutation result growth advantage [ 12 ] . The latter term passenger mutation , former refer driver mutation . It widely believe number driver mutation cancer sample limit handful , usually two less ten [ 13 ] . In contrast , genome cancer harbour million somatic mutation [ 14 ] consider passenger . Several study show passenger mutation may oncogenic driver may importance adaptive immune resistance tumor . In particular relevant mutation likely nonsynonymous exonic mutation tumor ; may give rise novel protein differ wild type counterpart immunogenically relevant ( review [ 10 ] ) . The study explore relationship genetic mutation success pembrolizumab .</detailed_description>
