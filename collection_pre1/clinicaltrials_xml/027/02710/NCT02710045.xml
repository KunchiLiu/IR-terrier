	<brief_title>The Interaction Between Measles DTP Vaccination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many study demonstrate routine Expanded Program Immunisation ( EPI ) vaccination `` non-specific '' `` heterologous '' effect child survival account protection vaccine specific disease . These effect overlook past assumed impact survival would proportional reduction target infection . Large epidemiological study Bangladesh Guinea-Bissau show live vaccine , include measles vaccine ( MV ) , beneficial effect overall mortality explain protection vaccine specific disease . Deleterious non-specific effect show convincingly high-titre MV trial girl , boy , two-fold increase mortality even though vaccine fully protective measles . A reinterpretation trial indicate likely explanation increase female mortality due inactivate vaccine provide MV . It show small observational study receive diphtheria , tetanus whole cell pertussis combine vaccine ( DTwP ) either MV negate beneficial effect MV , may lead increased mortality . However , increase mortality girl male-female twin pair apparent MV give last dose DTwP . In present EPI schedule The Gambia , DTwP administer single dose vaccine 2 , 3 4 month , MV nine month . However , many child , particularly low income country , present late vaccine may subsequently receive wrong order . In particular DTP often give wrong time point , e.g . third DTP dose ( DTP3 ) MV . Given increase evidence order vaccine administer crucial , routine practice administer miss EPI vaccine late presentation boost DTP year 2 may advisable . The mechanism behind effect unknown , whether immunological basis yet explore . The majority control trial vaccine efficacy focused vaccine specific antibody ( Ab ) responses test vaccine efficacy , study investigate T cell memory induction , despite fact likely critical long term protection . Indeed , cellular response MV seem crucial protect severe disease death , cellular response require protect Bordetella pertussis infection . Live vaccine bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) MV show stimulate Th1 type immune response . The immune response DTwP , kill vaccine , tend Th2 bias early life , despite fact whole cell pertussis component bias towards Th1 response . DTwP contain aluminium base adjuvant , aluminium hydroxide , excellent promote humoral Th2 response , poor generate good cell mediate immunity long term T cell memory . This polarisation cellular reactivity live kill vaccine may explain administer kill vaccine live vaccine abrogate beneficial effect live vaccine . Conversely , administer live vaccine DTwP may cause shift towards protective Th1 type immunity , thus diminish harmful effect DTwP provide non-specific survival benefit . Interestingly , aluminium hydroxide show cause enhance susceptibility tuberculosis ( TB ) animal model . Thus aluminium adjuvant DTwP may play role deleterious effect DTwP live vaccine , possibly influence generation T cell memory infection vaccine . Attributing observed effect DTwP / MV interaction entirely shift Th1 / Th2 profile likely simplification , provide good start point unravelling phenomenon . Other arm immune response need consider regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) Th17 inflammatory T cell lineage . The former heterogeneous group naturally occur induce T cell , show play regulatory role immunity number infectious disease , almost nothing known generation functional role vaccine immunogenicity human . Newborns know high level functional Tregs , likely essential control immune response antigen encounter early life , well modulate self reactive response . Measles vaccination cause suppression T cell response , measles vaccinate child upregulate FOXP3 expression ( Ota et al , personal communication ) , suggest role Tregs . Thus Treg induction likely important component immune response MV . This study investigate detail immunological consequence give DTP MV alone time . The study involve intervention trial analyse effect give DTP MV generation T cell memory ( effector central ) , humoral response , pro-inflammatory cytokine profile ( Th1 , Th2 , Th17 ) Treg responses measles recall antigens . Our detailed immunological study provide vital immunological data potential mechanism DTP / MV interaction . A comprehensive understanding immunological effect administer either DTP alone DTP MV simultaneously help u understand intervention might detrimental , may suggest need refine current EPI practice . It also crucial gain detail understanding immunological effect possible deleterious interaction current EPI vaccine , introduce new vaccine become available test early life e.g . TB malaria vaccine . Furthermore , understand mechanism whereby MV provide survival benefit might identify strategy harness future vaccine design . All infant give MV challenge 18 month age immunological parameter analyse 1 month later . This establish whether vaccine group effect 10 month age persist 18 month age influence immune response new immune challenge . Two major hypothesis detail test start point , multiple immunological assay conduct include multiplex cytokine analysis whole human transcriptome analysis require bioinformatics approach , therefore aspect study exploratory . Furthermore analysis take sex account since heterologous effect vaccine different male female , female generally susceptible . Hypotheses : 1 . DTP ( kill vaccine ) drive primarily Th2 response MV ( live vaccine ) drive primarily Th1 response . A DTP driven Th2 response occur time try activate Th1 response MV interfere prim measles specific memory response responses recall antigen . 2 . The extra Th2 stimulation DTP time MV provide many signal allow generation regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) essential component immunological response MV .</detailed_description>
