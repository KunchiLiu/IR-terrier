	<brief_summary>Despite advance prenatal diagnosis postnatal therapy , include extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) , inhale nitric oxide therapy , ventilator strategy minimize ventilator-induced lung injury , morbidity mortality rate baby congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( CDH ) remain high . The survival relate degree prenatal lung compression subsequent impairment pulmonary function follow delivery . Prenatal assessment ultrasound magnetic resonance imaging allow estimate severity relate circumference lung contralateral hernia fetal head circumference ( Lung head ratio ( LHR ) note degree upward herniation liver . Based observed expect lung head ratio ( O/E LHR ) prenatally diagnose congenital diaphragmatic hernia prognostically assess . While overall survival congenital diaphragmatic hernia approximately 60 % , O/E LHR &lt; 25 % associate survival 11-24 % . The rationale fetal therapy severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia restore adequate lung growth neonatal survival . Prenatal tracheal occlusion obstructs normal egress lung fluid pulmonary development lead increase lung tissue stretch , increase cell proliferation , accelerate lung growth . European colleague develop intrauterine endoscopic technique ( fetoscopy ) position remove endoluminal tracheal balloon utero ( fetoscopic endotracheal occlusion = FETO ) . Recently , Belgium group publish summary result FETO show improved survival 175 patient isolated leave CDH 24 % 49 % . The goal pilot study study feasibility implement FETO therapy severe group fetuses leave congenital diaphragmatic hernia ( O/E LHR &lt; 25 % ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>4 . Study Procedures The FETO feasibility study un-blinded non-randomized single arm pilot study conduct Johns Hopkins Hospital . Pregnant woman screen protocol inclusion exclusion criterion recruit base . Comprehensive fetal evaluation complete Johns Hopkins Center Fetal Therapy confirm eligibility . This include ultrasound , magnetic resonance imaging , fetal echocardiogram fetal genetic study identify case isolate congenital diaphragmatic hernia . Once eligibility confirm , participation FETO treatment offer . The voluntary nature participation stress throughout . Willingness logistics participant remain supervision Center Fetal Therapy Johns Hopkins Hospital , fetal airway occlude , also discuss detail . Informed write consent obtain prior study related procedure . 1 . Study design : Participants undergo FETO standardize preoperative , intraoperative , post-operative care delivery . The procedure perform local anesthesia intravenous sedation regional spinal/epidural ( do currently shunt laser procedure ) . Prophylactic tocolysis use indomethacin begin preoperatively . Fetal analgesia immobilization consist fentanyl , atropine vecuronium . A 10 Fr cannula , 1.3 mm fetoscope within 3.3 mm sheath ( Karl Storz , Tuttlingen , Germany ) , detachable balloon occlusion ( BALTACCI-BDPE , Balt , Montmorency , France ) system use . Participants receive intravenous magnesium sulfate breakthrough labor may discharge oral nifedipine treat post intervention contraction . Serial ultrasound measurement lung volume LHR begin within 24-48 hour follow surgery continue weekly . Amniotic fluid level membrane status also monitor weekly interval . Ultrasonography fetal growth perform every four week . All discharge participant support person need remain within 30 minute surgery center delivery permit standardize postoperative management . The social worker Center Fetal Therapy serve participant advocate assist family identify subsidized appropriate accommodation require . Participants modify bed rest first 2 week post discharge , subsequently allow graduate moderate activity uterus quiescent . Postoperative surveillance fetal well-being perform weekly begin 28 week . At 34+0 34 week 6 day , participant undergo removal tracheal balloon . Balloon retrieval either utero puncture ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle fetoscopic retrieval . Uncomplicated retrieval patient manage outpatient weekly fetal monitoring delivery . In event need emergent balloon removal prior 34 week due development preterm labor , shorten cervix , preterm rupture membrane , abnormally vigorous lung response development fetal hydrops , delivery EXIT cesarean section perform . If percutaneous puncture balloon unsuccessful prior delivery , immediate bronchoscopy establishment airway perform . Maternal corticosteroid ( betamethasone 12 mg intramuscularly repeat 24 hour ) administer 48 hour prior fetoscopic balloon removal ( due risk preterm delivery associate instrumentation ) impend preterm delivery . Timing induction labor 37 week 0 day 39 week 0 day depend upon favorable status cervix . Cesarean section base upon standard obstetrical indication . In regard postnatal care , resuscitation team neonatology pediatric surgery present delivery . A standardized protocol utilized postnatal care , use lung protection strategy . While primary end-points study demonstration feasibility safety FETO neonatal survival discharge continue follow-up child age 2 plan current standard care . These follow ups may include bronchoscopy , brain imaging , audiology examination , pulmonary function testing , chest radiograph developmental assessment . 2 .
