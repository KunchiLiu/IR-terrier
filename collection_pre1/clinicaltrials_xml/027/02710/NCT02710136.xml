	<brief_summary>This research do look body 's response cockroach extract , allergen , spray nose . The spray cockroach extract participant 's nose call Nasal Allergen Challenge ( NAC ) . The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability intranasal cockroach extract give participant asthma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cockroach Nasal Allergen Challenge Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi‐center , open label pilot study ass safety determine feasibility cockroach nasal allergen challenge child asthma . This pilot study occur two phase : - Phase 1 enroll 10 cockroach sensitive adult asthma undergo nasal allergen challenge increase dos cockroach allergen . Phase 1 consist two part , Phase 1a Phase 1b . In Phase 1a , participant undergo nasal allergen challenge . In Phase 1b , participant undergo repeat nasal allergen challenge ass reproducibility NAC cockroach allergen population asthma . The data Phase 1a use identify range dose safe elicits threshold nasal symptom ( TNSS ≥8 ) . - Phase 2 enroll 25 cockroach sensitive child asthma age 8‐14 year undergo nasal allergen challenge use dose range identify Phase 1a . Study mandate procedure include : blood draw ( venipuncture ) ; pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) ; nasal allergen challenge ( NAC ) ; allergen skin testing ; peak expiratory flow .</detailed_description>

Subject and/or parent guardian must able understand provide inform consent . 2 . Male female adult , 18 55 year age recruitment ( Phase 1 ) male female child , 8‐14 year age recruitment ( Phase 2 ) . 3 . Have history asthma minimum 1 year study entry : 1 . A diagnosis asthma study define report clinical diagnosis asthma make physician year ago . 2 . The subject must persistent asthma define current need least 100 microgram ( mcg ) fluticasone per day equivalent another inhaled corticosteroid . 3 . The subject 's asthma must well control define : A Forced Expiratory Volume 1 Second ( FEV1 ) ≥ 80 % predict . An Asthma Control Test ( ACT ) score ≥ 20 . 4 . Are sensitive German Cockroach document positive ( ≥ 3 mm great negative control ) skin prick test result positive German Cockroach specific immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) ( ≥0.35 kUA/L ) . 5 . Have know contraindication allergenic extract diluent . Subjects meet follow criterion eligible enrollment study participant Phase 1b completion Phase 1a : 1 . Their asthma must well control define : 1 . A FEV1 ≥ 80 % predict . 2 . An Asthma Control Test ( ACT ) score ≥ 20 . 2 . The subject tolerate Nasal Allergen Challenge ( NAC ) Phase 1a adverse event grade 2 high determine `` Guidance Industry : Toxicity Grading Scale Healthy Adult Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials ( publish September 2007 ) local reaction study procedure . '' Subjects eligible enrollment study participant Phase 1b completion Phase 1a follow criterion meet : 1 . Are pregnant lactating . 2 . Have asthma severity classification severe persistent , use NAEPP classification , evidence least one following : 1 . Require dose great 500 mcg fluticasone per day equivalent another inhaled corticosteroid . 2 . Have receive 2 course oral parenteral corticosteroid within last 12 month one course within last 3 month . 3 . Have treat depot corticosteroid within last 12 month . 4 . Have hospitalize asthma within 12 month prior participation Phase1b . 5 . Have emergency room visit asthma within 3 month prior participation Phase 1b . 6 . Have life‐threatening asthma exacerbation require intubation , mechanical ventilation , result hypoxic seizure within 2 year prior participation Phase 1b . 3 .

Have past current medical problem finding physical examination laboratory test list , , opinion investigator , may pose additional risk participation study , may interfere subject 's ability comply study requirement may impact quality interpretation data obtain study . 8 . Meet Participant Stopping Rules Withdrawal Criteria Phase 1a The participant elect withdraw consent future study activity , include followup . The Investigator longer believe participation best interest participant . SAE related investigational product . Anaphylactic reaction grade 2 3 . Inability tolerate NAC prior reach TNSS ≥8 due excessive discomfort symptom . Epistaxis occur Challenge Visit . The need start immunotherapy chronic immunosuppressive medication period Phase 1a Phase 1b . Require dose great 500 mcg fluticasone per day equivalent another inhaled corticosteroid maintain asthma control period Phase 1a Phase 1b . Inability restrict use antihistamine , nasal steroid , nasal decongestant , nasal anticholinergic cromolyn prior NAC . Development serious medical illness whose natural history , sequela , treatment would worsen impaired continuation protocol . Subject `` lose follow‐up '' 9 . The subject 's initial TNSS Repeat Challenge Visit must within 1 point initial TNSS Challenge Visit Phase 1a . If participant 's initial TNSS outside 1 point range , participant may reevaluate Repeat Challenge Visit 3 additional time . STUDY EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects fulfil follow criterion eligible enrollment portion study may reassess . Participants ineligible : 1 . Plan move area study period . 2 . Have history idiopathic anaphylaxis anaphylaxis grade 2 high define grade scale Brown et al . anaphylaxis systemic reaction study procedure . 3 . Have unstable angina , significant arrhythmia , uncontrolled hypertension , history autoimmune disease , chronic immunological disease opinion investigator might interfere evaluation investigational agent pose additional risk participant . 4 . Are use tricyclic antidepressant beta‐adrenergic blocker drug ( oral topical ) .
