	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare neurodevelopment activity infant bear preterm ( 26 33 6/7 week gestational age ( GA ) ) receive Standard Care ( SC ) Family Nurture Intervention ( FNI ) neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . The study investigator hypothesize FNI improve : ) neonatal electroencephalographic activity ii ) maternal caregiving wellbeing ( psychological physiological ) , iii ) infant behavior neurodevelopment 18 month correct age ( CA ) . The two-part study aim : - Part I - replicate efficacy earlier trial conduct study multiple site allow great generalizability . - SC , approximately 60 infant plus parent - FNI , approximately 60 infant plus parent - Term Controls , approximately 25 infant plus parent - enrollment reach , enrollment may continue Part II - Part II - examine effectiveness implement FNI unit-wide every baby receive intervention . - FNI , approximately 60 infant plus parent</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Increasing number study demonstrate importance early mother-infant nurturing interaction long-term outcome demonstrates need prevention/remedial intervention neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . The foremost goal neonatal intensive care ensure survival medical stability infant . Within NICU , parental involvement care necessarily supersede healthcare staff 's need assure survival . Thus , necessary detrimental separation mother infant create critical period mother-infant connection synchrony develop . The physiological challenge associate born soon , along disturbance normal mother-infant interaction , key factor underlie risk premature infant broad range early midlife disorder . Not preterm infant increase risk adverse outcome ( &gt; 50 % ) , 40 % mother infant suffer depression postpartum period many mother suffer symptom trauma post-traumatic stress . Importantly , father preterm infant also increase postnatal depression . In addition , recent review 10 study find mother preterm infant increase risk subsequent ischemic heart disease , stroke , atherosclerosis , death due cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Delivery preterm infant long lasting effect parent mother father report increase parent stress infant reach 7 year age . This study allow examination immediate long-term effect new approach development preterm infant cardiovascular risk parent .</detailed_description>
