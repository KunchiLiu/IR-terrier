	<brief_summary>Specific Aims : 1 . To find genetic variation associate spatial work memory performance patient ADHD use genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) ; 2 . To find genetic variation associate spatial work memory performance healthy subject use GWAS ; 3 . To recruit validation sample replicate finding initial GWAS ; 4 . To test whether genetic variation significantly associate spatial work memory also associate ADHD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Genome-wide Association Study Endophenotype Spatial Working Memory ADHD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , characterize inattention , hyperactivity impulsivity , early onset , highly heritable , clinically heterogeneous , long-term impair disorder tremendous impact individual , family , society . Our research team conduct series biological study spatial work memory deficit ADHD , substantial evidence suggest spatial work memory deficit important neuropsychological biomarker translational value favorable endophenotypic property ADHD . Despite abundance molecular genetic study ADHD , genetic etiology ADHD non-conclusive . Because genetic study endophenotypes offer information genetic brain process , endophenotypic approach efficiently enhance statistical power make genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) applicable much small sample . To date , GWAS study spatial work memory deficit ADHD . This 3-year project . Our previous study collect blood sample spatial work memory data 382 patient ADHD 150 healthy subject . In 3-year project , recruit 232 healthy subject , age 7-18 year . The measure include ( 1 ) interview psychopathology ( K-SADS-E ) , ( 2 ) questionnaire measure ADHD symptom ( SNAP-IV ) , ( 3 ) neuropsychological test : Spatial Working Memory task CANTAB . In first year , case-only GWAS spatial work memory ( n = 254 ) conduct . In second year , control-only GWAS spatial work memory ( n = 254 ) conduct . In third year , finding initial two GWAS replicate validation sample compose 128 patient ADHD 128 healthy control . By careful calculation , sample size 382 ADHD subject provide adequate power detect genome-wide significant genetic variation replicate finding independent validation sample . We anticipate identify relationship genetic variation ADHD endophenotype spatial work memory . Our finding significantly contribute understand pathophysiological mechanism ADHD , especially pathological pathway gene , endophenotype , behavioral phenotype .</detailed_description>
