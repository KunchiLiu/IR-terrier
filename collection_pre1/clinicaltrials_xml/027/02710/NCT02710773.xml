	<detailed_description>Loss walk ability one major problem stroke recovery walking priority goal patient . Several study demonstrate rehabilitation could effective treatment improve gait follow stroke . Learning walk backwards correctly recommend improve movement component require walking forward . Backward walking , therefore , promote treatment strategy improve gait . During backward walk motor programme use forward walk , possibly run reverse . It suggest backward walk may offer benefit beyond experienced forward walk alone . Backward walk appear create muscle activity proportion effort forward walk . This suggest great level energy expenditure backward walk forward walk . Additionally , backward walking also demand great oxygen consumption , metabolic response cardiorespiratory forward walk . Up knowledge , two study demonstrate positive effect additional backward walk train post stroke patient . Yang coll . examine effectiveness additional backward walk train gait outcome 25 subacute stroke patient demonstrate asymmetric gait pattern could improve . In recently study , randomize control trail conduct 36 acute stroke patient evaluate efficacy walk backwards treadmill . The patient randomly allocate three group receive 3 week intervention : first group ( n=12 ) underwent partial body weight support treadmill training backwards , second group ( n=12 ) receive partial body weight support treadmill train third group underwent conventional rehabilitation training . The result show significant improvement walk speed rivermead Mobility Index , suggest Partial Body Weight Support treadmill backward train patient early phase acute stroke effective improving mobility . Recently , gait rehabilitation method patient neurological impairment rely technological device , drive patient 's gait body-weight support condition emphasize beneficial role repetitive practice . The rationale approach originate animal study show repetition gait movement may enhance spinal supraspinal locomotor circuit . Two review concludes treadmill train partial body weight support effective improve walk speed endurance without worsen gait quality</detailed_description>
