	<brief_summary>Participants schedule endo bronchial ultrasound ( EBUS ) trans bronchial needle aspiration ( TBNA ) provide additional sample . These sample send Imperial College London see whether cell line grow . If growth successful sample return pathology department see grade possible compare result previous diagnostic sample . The cell line sample use patient diagnosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use EBUS TBNA Cell Culture Aid Diagnose Lung Cancer Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obtaining adequate pathological specimen essential diagnosis cancer . Ultrasound guide sample endo bronchial ultrasound ( EBUS ) trans bronchial needle aspiration ( TBNA ) emerge safe accurate technique diagnosis stag lung cancer subtyping and/or genotyping TBNA sample obtain convex probe EBUS long consider limited lack tissue architecture small tissue sample . The performance small tissue sample non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) subtyping proven accurate modern pathology practice adopt cell block immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , reduce NSCLC otherwise specify rate needle aspiration sample 8-23 % . It also show recently promise result work mediastinal lymphadenopathy lymphoma suspect . It think time EBUS TBNA sample still inadequate essential test diagnostic therapeutic purpose enhance yield possibly cell culture useful diagnosing lung cancer lymphoma also provide material future research study . We therefore develop research proposal collaboration scientist biomedical research laboratory Imperial College London , excellent record basic scientific research currently involve similar research cell culture type disease .</detailed_description>
