	<brief_summary>Patients obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) frequently stop breathe sleep . They often develop high blood pressure . We sure drug best treat high blood pressure . This study give patient nebivolol hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ ) 6 week 2 week placebo . The blood pressure response evaluate 24 hour monitoring .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment OSA Associated Hypertension With Nebivolol Hydrochlorothiazide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This blind crossover study measure antihypertensive efficacy nebivolol v HCTZ 34 subject . Subjects apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) &gt; 10 hypertension enter study . Hypertension define systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &gt; 140 diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) &gt; 90 average three seat blood pressure measurement history medical therapy hypertension . Subjects try abandon continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy sleep apnea eligible study . All others advise CPAP prefer treatment sleep apnea eligible decline CPAP use short time night effective . Then patient antihypertensive drug taper receive single blind placebo two week . After , subject receive nebivolol HCTZ six week full evaluation time . Subjects cross HCTZ 12.5 mg 2 week follow HCTZ 25 mg 4 week . Nebivolol 5 mg take daily bedtime 2 week dose 10 mg remain 4 week . Subjects receive telephone call time increase dosage reminder . Blood , urine 24-hour blood pressure measurement , hemodynamic measurement , questionnaire drug accountability measure manner toward end placebo drug treatment . The entire study take 14 week , although study period may lengthen one week necessary convenience subject 's personal schedule . Patients provide blood pressure read home monitor clinic dose increase systolic blood pressure 105 mm Hg side effect suggest increase dose might worsen side effect At end treatment period , subject undergo noninvasive hemodynamic testing . Ultrasound used measure aortic diameter blood velocity ascend aorta order well estimate cardiac output . Then , finger plethysmography use acquire beat-to-beat finger blood pressure pulse rate . Beat-to-beat derive hemodynamic variable calculate model flow algorithm ( e.g . brachial artery flow , stroke volume , cardiac output , ejection time , blood pressure rate change , peripheral resistance ) . Applanation tonometry use obtain pulse wave velocity central arterial pressure . ECG record standard ECG lead determine heart rate variability time frequency domain . Spontaneous baroreflex determine beat-to-beat change blood pressure pulse pressure interval . Forearm reactive hyperemia use quantify endothelial dysfunction 4 minute post-ischemic change . Subjects complete Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire ( ESS ) Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire ( FOSQ ) find whether drowsy daytime feel compromise adequate rest . Any adverse event record . They ask concurrent medication prior period , include prescription medication , counter medication , caffeine intake . Medication compliance evaluate pill count . Those fail return pill bottle request bring . Finally , 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor ( ABPM ) attach automatically collect blood pressure heart rate value every 15 minute wake period every 30 minute sleep period .</detailed_description>
