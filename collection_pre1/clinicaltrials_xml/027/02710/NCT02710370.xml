	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine gastric bypass surgery effect metabolism obesity Type 2 Diabetes . One mechanism investigate animal model change biology small intestine ( Roux limb ) glucose fuel metabolize ( body digest use sugar fuel ) . This study evaluate role intestine beneficial metabolic effect gastric bypass surgery . It specifically examine whether intestine increase metabolism activity , whether result increase fuel utilization . Thirty two ( 32 ) subject recruit ( 18 14 without Type 2 Diabetes ) . At time gastric bypass surgery , small piece intestine usually discard collect . At three time point first year surgery , intestinal sample obtain endoscopy insertion light flexible tube mouth . Blood sample take time point , well . All sample undergo comprehensive metabolic analysis . Comparisons make two group understand metabolic change time difference two group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intestinal Metabolic Reprogramming Key Mechanism Gastric Bypass Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several study conclude Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery ( RYGBS ) best current treatment option obesity-related Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) . The mechanisms underlying RYGBS-induced improvement glycemic control remain unclear . Many investigator advocate effect depend upon body weight loss , base clinical observation improvement glucose homeostasis occur early postoperative period , often prior hospital discharge . Understanding mechanisms underlying metabolic effect RYGBS help engineer way improve RYGB produce effect without surgery . This study examine concept intestinal metabolic reprogramming one key mechanism action diabetes improvement follow Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery ( RYGBS ) human . It hypothesize reconfigured intestine characterize increase energetically expensive process , structural remodeling , cytoskeletal reorganization , cellular proliferation . To accommodate increased bioenergetics demand , intestinal epithelium increase metabolic activity reprograms fuel utilization . Specifically , glucose , cholesterol amino acid metabolism dramatically alter increase anabolic pathways generate building block cellular growth maintenance . It previously possible test hypothesis human : A ) adaptive process intestine patient undergo RYGBS thoroughly characterize , B ) know whether intestinal reprogramming appear early enough explain prompt improvement glucose metabolism observe RYGBS human , C ) variability degree intestinal metabolic adaptation , could account variability remission T2DM , study . This study perform longitudinal , comprehensive metabolic analysis Roux limb human subject without T2DM undergo RYGBS determine time course adaptive metabolic change . Eighteen ( 18 ) subject fourteen ( 14 ) subject without T2DM ( total 32 subject ) , schedule undergo RYGBS standard care , recruit . For enrolled subject , data collection include intestinal tissue sample ( Roux limb tissue sample discard tissue ) time RYGBS , mucosa jejunum , within 40 cm gastrojejunal anastomosis . Postoperatively , tissue sample area perform Upper GI endoscopy , 1 month ( ±15 day ) , 6 month ( ±1 month ) 12 month ( ±2 month ) RYGBS . Tissue sample process histo-morphological examination RNA , protein metabolomics analysis . A blood sample obtain time point analyze metabolic biomarkers . Data analysis include description comparison morphological , gene protein metabolite signature intestinal ( Roux limb ) tissue blood biomarkers time point . Additionally , outcome measure compare two group ( T2DM Non-T2DM ) . Finally , correlation intestinal adaptive change metabolic status , eat behavior , adverse symptomatology , quality life undertaken .</detailed_description>
