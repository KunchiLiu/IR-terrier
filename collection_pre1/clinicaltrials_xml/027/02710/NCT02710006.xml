	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION The uterus one key organs reproduction fetal development . A distorted shape size uterine cavity may significant impact reproductive failure ( Chan et al. , 2011 ; Saravelos et al. , 2008 ) . Current definition classification uterine morphology congenital malformation still controversial ( Grimbizis et al. , 2013 ; 2015 ; Ludwin Ludwin , 2015a , b ) . This important barrier study evaluate effectiveness intervention woman condition ( Ludwin et al. , 2015 , b ) . The uterine cavity volume specific feature individual uterus , together shape uterine cavity may play one crucial role etiology reproductive failure . To investigator ' knowledge uterine cavity volume never study context ( Ludwin et al. , 2016 ) . Recently , technique uterine cavity imaging , volume estimation , quantification deformity degree use automatic volume calculation ( call SonoHysteroAVC ; use SonoAVC software ; GE Medical Systems , Zipf , Austria ) three-dimensional sonohysterography describe ( Ludwin et al. , 2016 ) . Uterine volume estimation also potentially possible use Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis ( VOCALâ„¢ ; GE Medical Systems , Zipf , Austria ) , endometrial volume calculation ( Martins et al. , 2011 ) . The investigator believe SonoHysteroAVC technique might improve knowledge uterine anatomy , diagnostic accuracy uterine cavity shape imaging , management woman different morphological shape uterine cavity . ( Ludwin et al. , 2016 ) . AIMS AND HYPOTHESES Objective : assess inter-observer reliability measure uterine cavity volume automatic volume calculation . Hypothesis : inter-observer reliability uterine cavity volume estimation use automatic volume calculation good . Additional objective : compare SonoAVC VOCAL uterine cavity volume estimation DESIGN AND PATIENTS Design : Described elsewhere Setting : Described elsewhere Patients : Described elsewhere Inclusion criterion : Described elsewhere Exclusion criterion : Described elsewhere Sample size : The reliability estimate uterine cavity automatic volume estimation unknown . The feasibility automatic volume calculation deferent uterine condition also unknown . The investigator assume 100 subject would sufficient obtain precise reliability coefficient ( Streiner Kottner , 2014 ) , 30 participant minimal sample size feasibility study . Interventions : Repeated three-dimensional sonohysterography ( 3D-SIS ) . Data acquisition : two 3D data-sets 3D-SIS per participant ( observer 0 ; Obs0 ) . Analysis : Observer A ( ObsA ) analyze 1st data-set twice 2nd data-set . Observer B ( ObsB ) analyze 2nd data-set . Comparisons : ObsA-Dataset1 ( 1st analysis ) vs. ObsA-Dataset1 ( 2nd analysis ) determine repeatability ObsA-Dataset1 vs. ObsA-Dataset2 determine variability cause repeating procedure ObsA-Dataset2 vs. ObsB-Dataset2 determine inter-observer variability read ObsA-Dataset1 vs. ObsB-Dataset2 determine inter-observer variability cause repeat exam Outcomes : ) The concordance correlation coefficient ii ) Limits agreement ( LoA ) iii ) Time need acquisition iv ) Time need analysis Additional aim : SonoAVC v VOCAL ( reproducibility time need ) Data processing analysis : The researcher ensure confidentiality sensitive data minimize number personnel handle subject data . Consent : All subject give detailed explanation study write consent form sign patient retain investigator ' confidential record .</detailed_description>
