	<brief_title>A Cost-effectiveness Analysis Single-implant Mandibular Overdenture Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize clinical trial alongside cost-effectiveness analysis include twenty-eight edentulous individual meet eligibility criterion . New maxillary mandibular denture fabricate participant follow standardized protocol . Then , participant randomize one treatment group : conventional complete denture group single-implant mandibular overdenture group . Each participant allocate overdenture group receive Straumann® Standard Plus SLActive® regular neck implant ( Straumann 0.33.051S/052S/053S Institute Straumann AG , Basel , Switzerland ) mandibular midline . A healing abutment connect implant allow heal approximately 3 week . Then , 3.4mm retentive titanium anchor abutment ( Straumann 048.439 , Institute Straumann AG , Basel , Switzerland ) connect tighten 35 N.cm torque wrench . The matrix incorporate denture use self-curing acrylic resin patient instruct keep upper low denture firmly occlude habitual position final polymerization resin . Direct cost related therapy group identify , measure valuate one year treatment patient-reported outcome assess . Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimate graphically present cost-effectiveness plane . A Markov decision tree construct set consequence compete alternative . Sensitivity analysis important assumption perform order ass robustness model .</detailed_description>
