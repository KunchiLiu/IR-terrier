	<brief_title>Rectal Sparing Approach After Preoperative Radio and/or Chemotherapy Patients With Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction rationale Neoadjuvant therapy , especially preoperative chemoradiotherapy ( pCRT ) short-course radiotherapy follow total mesorectal excision ( TME ) , standard treatment mid-low rectal cancer . This approach significantly reduce rate local recurrence compare surgery alone , post-operative radiochemotherapy long-course radiotherapy alone . Concerning indication neoadjuvant treatment regimen , still wide discrepancy literature . Based dutch TME trial , show low rate local recurrence patient treat short-course radiotherapy ( RT ) compare TME alone , neoadjuvant therapy indication rectal cancer RT short-course alone . Meanwhile , German trial publication , indication rectal cancer treatment , 15 cm anal verge , combination hyperfractionated RT 5-fluorouracil base chemotherapy ( CT ) . Two subsequent trial ( Polish trial Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group trial ) show RT short-course alone CRT hyperfractionated RT similar oncological outcome . Thus , recent year increase interest administration neoadjuvant chemotherapy therapeutic dose radiosensitizers . Regimens basically follow : induction regimen consolidation regimen . In first case , CT precede pCRT , consolidation regimen CT follow pCRT . The rationale strategy , currently , mortality rectal cancer come distant metastasis , give full dose chemotherapy prevent occurrence distant recurrence , rationale chemotherapy early possible many patient feasible ( patient compliance perform adjuvant chemotherapy low , often complication arise surgery ) . More recently , study publish use neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone currently underway US PROSPECT trial evaluate possibility use neoadjuvant chemotherapy select case instead classic CRT . For many reason ( enrolment patient clinical trial , refusal patient perform treatment consider standard toxicity radio and/or chemotherapy ) uncommon clinical practice observe patient perform unconventional treatment provide national international guideline . Positive negative consequence neoadjuvant treatment Neoadjuvant treatment follow TME involve high percentage side effect associate surgical complication early late , toxicity associate radiation chemotherapy alteration bowel function , sexual , fecal continence thus quality life ( QoL ) . Among advantage neoadjuvant therapy , particularly treatment associate CRT , notable 15-20 % case disappearance primary tumor , pathologic complete response ( pCR ) . Also lengthen interval pRT and/or CT surgery associate increased rate pCR , therefore , unlike traditional 4-6 week interval end neoadjuvant therapy surgery , currently tendency perform surgery 8-10 week , even 12 week . In patient pCR neoadjuvant therapy , show well outcome long term residual disease . Rationale behind rectum-sparing approach In order avoid morbidity functional sequela associate neoadjuvant therapy follow TME base excellent outcome see patient pCR , propose , patient major clinical ( mCR ) complete ( cCR ) response , opt conservative approach include preservation rectum . During recent year see grow interest conservative approach , demonstrate increase number publication new therapeutic strategy include observation ( `` wait see '' policy ) local excision . Local excision . LE consider essentially excisional biopsy decision observe patient ( follow-up ) run TME LE depend histologic feature . Patients neoplasia ( pCR ) minimal residual disease ( ypT1 tumor regression grade &lt; 3 margin free ) follow close follow-up . In remain case opts subsequent intervention TME . Studies concern LE neoadjuvant treatment numerous principal lack retrospective , low number definition always clear concordant mCR cCR . In addition , study include patient subjected radical surgery due medical comorbidities reject radical surgical treatment , especially expect final packaging stoma . More recently publish prospective study phase 2 phase 3 consistently show LE feasible approach oncological result comparable standard approach . Among study , worth highlight presence multicenter Italian Phase 2 ( Pucciarelli et al , 2013 ) . The author show rate local recurrence , median follow-up 3 year , less 5 % patient cancer rectum medium-low cT2-3 , pRT and/or CT , report major clinical response subject LE . The study approve Ethics Committee Padua later ethic committee three participate center . The indication LE new trial previous study . Wait-and-see . This second approach design developed Brazil , widely spread throughout world . Compared EL , approach avoids entire operation consequently complication related LE . However , LE appear indicated patient cCR mCR , wait-and-see approach require cCR . The reason different indication probability correlation cCR pCR high ; unlike correlation mCR pCR much low . As show scientific paper publish topic ( Smith et al , ... ) , risk 20 % response consider complete actually . Non-operated patient therefore undergo strict follow-up course , case recurrence disease ( recurrence ) , run TME rescue . Even approach publish many study show one hand wait-and-see approach safe patient achieve cCR neoadjuvant therapy ; hand , disease persists , surgery , define `` rescue surgery '' , lead , case , local control percentage OS DFS completely similar traditional treatment . As thing stand , study compare two conservative option . The difference , base result publish , related indication : case LE , patient include mCR cCR , whereas wait-and-see approach include cCR patient . This phase II trial design test hypothesis conservative treatment , patient low-mid rectal cancer undergo major complete clinical response neoadjuvant treatment , safe effective compare standard surgery . Patients enrol trial show mCR cCR restaging 7-8 week end RT and/or CT ; response confirm second restaging ( 11-12 week ) , patient eligible conservative treatment . If response poor neoadjuvant therapy , see first second restaging , fully recommend undergo standard surgical treatment . The investigator compare rectum-sparing approach standard surgery , firstly , term rate organ preservation 2 year . Additionally , compare survival outcome ( DFS , OS ) , stoma rate , clinical tumor factor related pathological complete response , correlation major complete clinical response . To add value , investigator measure quality life ( QoL ) patient treat rectum-sparing approach comparison patient treat standard surgery ( TME abdomino-perineal amputation ) . The investigator ' recent pubblication ( Pucciarelli et al , 2013 ) experience provide basis produce new multicenter observational trial add important information rectum-sparing approach locally advanced rectal cancer patient , highlight relationship neoadjuvant treatment , clinical response conservative surgical approach . Study Design The propose study observational , prospective , multicenter study patient undergo neoadjuvant therapy medium-low rectal cancer . The investigator opt observational study since Phase 2 study complete Phase 3 study objectively , many Authors report , difficult perform patient enrollment . Since observational study aim evaluate effectiveness conservative approach neoadjuvant therapy term capacity preservation organ , give direction type radio and/or chemotherapy treatment . Patients enrol study patient candidate ( show study publish subject ) conservative approach . The `` registration '' patient mean evaluate many patient potentially candidate conservative treatment undergo neoadjuvant treatment ( secondary endpoint study ) . The collection data concern stag tumor basal scheme neoadjuvant therapy aim identify type cancer type neoadjuvant therapy associate high number pathological complete response ( secondary endpoint ) . Finally , patient show cCR , leave ability run LE wait-and-see approach , current state , data indicate option best term oncological result rate organ preservation . Study aim The primary objective study determine rate organ preservation 2 year patient rectal cancer treat neoadjuvant therapy follow conservative treatment ( LE wait-and-see ) . Secondary , study seek : 1 . Determine rate overall survival ( OS ) , disease-free ( DFS ) relapse-free local recurrence 2 , 3 , 5 year initiation treatment ; 2 . Determine rate patient without stoma 2 5 year ; 3 . Determine clinical tumor factor related treatment associate pathologic complete response ( pCR ) primary tumor ; 4 . Determine rate pCR patient treat LE conventional surgery ( TME ) ; 5 . Determine correlation major complete clinical response pCR ; 6 . Determine morbidity mortality neoadjuvant therapy conservative approach TME ; 7 . Determine percentage patient undergo conservative treatment total patient run pRT and/or CT ; 8 . Evaluate impact type treatment ability perform preoperative treatment rectum-sparing ; 9 . Evaluate impact surgical approach bowel function , fecal continence quality life ( QoL ) Clinical Evaluation Staging Clinical pathological primary Tumor , regional Nodes , Metastasis ( TNM ) stage determine accord American Joint Committee Cancer 7th Edition histological grade adenocarcinoma accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) . It stag baseline ( treatment ) . Patients candidate pRT and/or CT record . After end pRT and/or CT patient restage 7-8 week . If evidence response therapy , proceed surgery standard ( TME ) , patient show mCR cCR , second restaging 11-12 week end pRT and/or CT. At end second restaging , patient enrol rectum-sparing protocol show mCR cCR , otherwise candidate conventional surgery ( TME ) . Basal clinical stag baseline standard patient rectal cancer : 1. digital rectal examination ; 2. proctoscopy rigid endoscope complete colonoscopy ( executable lesion stenosis , recommend double contrast barium enema colon CT colonoscopy within 6 month surgery ) ; 3. pelvic MRI locoregional staging . If perform ( eg . claustrophobia ) , accept pelvic CT endorectal ultrasound . Lymph node diameter &gt; 0.5 cm along short axis consider metastatic ; 4. chest-abdominal CT evaluation distant metastases ; 5. carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) determination ; 6. compiling questionnaire ( QoL , bowel function , fecal continence ) . 1st Re-Staging pRT and/or CT ( 7-8 week end radiotherapy ) : 1 . Digital rectal examination ; 2 . Proctoscopy ; 3. chest-abdominal CT ; 4. pelvic MRI : evidence mCR cCR absence lymph node metastasis MRI , patient restaged 11-12 week completion pRT and/or CT treat rectum spar approach . If evidence mCR cCR , program surgery ( TME ) immediately . 2nd Re-staging pRT and/or CT ( 11-12 week end radiotherapy ) : 1. digital rectal examination ; 2 . Proctoscopy ; 3. pelvic MRI ( optional ) ; 4. acquisition inform consent ; 5 . Compile questionnaire ( QoL , bowel function , fecal continence ) optional . If confirm mCR cCR , patient undergoes spar rectum treatment . Functional quality life assessment As part study , also consider bowel function , QoL fecal continence . Participation ancillary study voluntary cover center ability manage distribution/collection questionnaire . Functional assessment : 1 . MSKCC bowel function instrument . Quality life assessment : 1 . EORTC QLQ - C30 ; 2 . EORTC QLQ - CR29 ; 3 . Fecal Incontinence Quality Life scale ( FIQL ) . Surgical treatment histopathological exam Rectal resection TME This carry accord standard technique use open laparoscopic approach include anterior resection abdominoperineal rectal resection ( Miles procedure ) . Local excision This do traditional technique endoscopic technique ( TEM , TAMIS , etc. ) . The rectum prepare use standard procedure TME approach include prophylactic antibiotic . For endoscopic technique generally require general anaesthesia , LE traditional technique sufficient regional anaesthesia . The patient position prone position , lithotomic side depend location tumor . Regardless technique perform , follow principle respect : 1 . A gross margin least 0.5 cm ; 2. full-thickness excision include mucosa , submucosa , muscle peri-rectal fat ; 3. determination specimen support pin edge order facilitate interpretation histological pathologist . The breach rectal wall close crosswise absorbable suture leave open . Histological examination Histological examination must include least follow information : 1. ypT ; 2 . Tumor regression grade ( TRG ) accord classification Mandard ( see Annex E ) . If persistence cancer , least follow describe : 1. state margin ; 2 . Degree cellular differentiation ; 3 . Presence lymphatic vascular invasion . Follow-up Follow-up strict , case fall within pattern follow-up provide current national guideline ( see guideline AIOM follow-up rectal cancer ) . Follow-up LE wait- and-see Patients visit every 3 month first two year , every 6 month follow three year . For check , perform : 1. digital rectal examination ; 2 . Proctoscopy ; 3 . CEA routine blood chemistry ; 4 . MRI every 6 month 5 year ; 5. chest -abdominal CT ( annually unless another clinical indication ) ; 6 . Colonoscopy ( 1 year , negative 3 year , still negative 5 year ) ; 7 . Compile questionnaire ( QoL , bowel function , fecal continence ) optional 6 12 month surgery . Recurrence definition Recurrences distinguish : - Local : recurrence pelvis , intraluminal extraluminal ; - Distance : relapse venue . The diagnosis recurrence determine base clinical , radiological image biopsy . Sample size Rectum-sparing approach consider clinically acceptable percentage conservation rectum two year less 50 % . The collect data 164 patient underwent `` rectum-sparing '' allow test hypothesis rectum preserve 60 % patient 80 % power ( exact binomial test proportion , alpha = 5 % , 1 tail ) study consider positive obtains frequency conservation rectum le 87 case .
