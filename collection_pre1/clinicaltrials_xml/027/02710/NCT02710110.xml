	<brief_summary>Dysphagia ( swallow impairment ) , dystussia ( cough impairment ) respiratory impairment hallmark feature amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) . These symptom cause fatal aspiration , malnutrition respiratory insufficiency together account 91.4 % ALS mortality . Unfortunately , treatment prolong maintain vital function currently lack . Although use exercise ALS controversial , recent evidence suggest mild moderate intensity exercise apply early disease slow disease progression , improve motor function , preserve motor neuron number , reduces muscle hypoplasia , atrophy astrogliosis , prolongs survival animal model ALS human clinical trial . This research study design determine impact respiratory strength training breathing , airway protection swallow person Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research study measure maximum inspiratory expiratory pressure secondary measure respiration , swallow , cough , quality life global disease progression follow twelve-weeks treatment compare sham group . As participant two evaluation University Florida Swallowing Systems Core laboratory locate Shands Hospital , Gainesville take place . Each take approximately two-hours space exactly three-months apart . During evaluation test perform look breathing , swallow , ability cough standard clinical exam . In addition , survey eat , speak quality life take . Breathing Exercises : home research therapist train participant use hand-held respiratory trainer . Training treatment group similar , except PowerLung trainer device additional spring load valve inside place force respiratory muscle train . The breathing trainer spring resistance place respiratory muscle train represent aerobic respiratory treatment . The breathing exercise complete five day week total three month ( total 60 therapy session ) . During session , total three set ten repetition breathe exercise perform . Once week home research therapist visit guide participant breathe exercise .</detailed_description>
