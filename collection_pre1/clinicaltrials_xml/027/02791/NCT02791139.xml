	<brief_title>Association Midlife Dietary Lifestyle Factors Cardiac Functional Changes Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proposal investigate midlife factor diet lifestyle affect various aspect cardiac structure function relate ageing . The investigator plan conduct study among sub-cohort 600 participant Singapore Chinese Health Study . Comprehensive information diet lifestyle factor collect recruitment update two subsequent follow-up interview . Candidate nutrition-related blood biomarkers vitamins D , homocysteine , fatty acid ( short , medium long-chain ) lipid ( LDL , HDL , triglyceride ) analyze sample obtain 1999 2004 . The investigator study effect smoke , alcohol consumption , sleep duration , physical activity diet cardiac ageing . The investigator study overall dietary pattern , intake specific item fatty acid , soy food , coffee tea beverage , validate food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ ) , nutrient questionnaire information cohort previously obtain . These nutrient lifestyle factor study individually , joint interactive effect cardiac age measurement . Quantitative cardiac ageing-related outcome parameter describe cardiac mass , systolic diastolic function , vessel distensibility examine cardiac magnetic resonance imaging . Maximum oxygen uptake ( VO2 max ) calculate base age , gender , waist circumference , rest heart rate , exercise habit . Body composition analyse body composition analyser machine onto subject stand .</detailed_description>
