	<brief_summary>The researcher propose study Gulf veteran Gulf War Illness ( GWI ) , characterize problem widespread pain . Besides pain , researcher also assess effect vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS ) alleviate migraine headache , another complaint Gulf veteran , common presence widespread pain . Importantly , researcher partner company make hand-held device allow stimulation vagus nerve without need surgery ; work patient put skin overlie vagus nerve neck turn 120 second period three time day . The device program deliver 6 bout stimulation per day - one side neck three time day ; inactive next day . The fact device use without surgery non-invasive make extremely practical use . After collect pre-treatment measurement pain severity headache severity , veteran receive either actual active VNS device inactive device , stimulate nerve . Veterans use device ten week - provide similar information periodically period respond question severity pain headache , They return Center final phase study veteran receive active device . Ten week later , return Center provide information allow investigator gain knowledge effectiveness actual VNS relieve pain - throughout body head .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Three Phases Study Subject Identification Phase Study face face visit War Related Illness &amp; Injury Study Center East Orange Veterans Administration Medical Center ( EOVAMC ) . Blinded Phase Study Office Visit [ first time Mount Sinai Beth Israel . ( MSBI ) ] Subjects randomize either VNS device inactive device . Open Label Phase Study All subject receive VNS device</detailed_description>
