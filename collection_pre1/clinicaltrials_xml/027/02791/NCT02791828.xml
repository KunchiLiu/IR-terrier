	<detailed_description>Chronic Hemodialysis treatment kidney failure . It involve construction three treatment session per week extrarenal lasting 4 hour . This treatment necessary impact quality life patient . Indeed , 2005 `` REIN quality life '' report demonstrate quality life people kidney failure impair , especially physical general component . The investigator believe improve overall quality life hemodialysis patient , must improve quality hemodialysis session . The quality criterion medical , must also take account patient 's perception course meeting : 's call quality experience dialysis session . Our daily healthcare practice show hemodialysis session experience differently patient accord different factor : physical , psychological , relational , technical , temporal . The quality experience hemodialysis session could positively influence use supplement occupational asset liability , improve patient satisfaction enhance relationship staff . Indeed , preliminary study ( nephrology unit establishment January 2012 ) 8 patient undergo active occupational educational activity hemodialysis , show experience hemodialysis session potentially improvable ( experienced patient improve , reduce cramp ... ) . However , assess impact measure live dialysis session quality life general , need measure quality live dialysis session . There , present , specific tool measure quality experience hemodialysis session . This tool would measure impact caregiver support occupational dialysis session . Objectives : The main objective study create validate instrument measure quality live hemodialysis chronic renal insufficiency subject . This do 3 step , 1st step establish item bank , second stage construction final calibration tool , third step psychometric validation questionnaire . Material Methods : To date , measure quality live hemodialysis session available validate . The investigator intend build validate quality instrument experience hemodialysis session people chronic kidney failure . The study conduct three stage : - First step : development bank issue item qualitative research subject ( literature review , expert opinion ) direct collection focus group people CKD . - Second step : operationalization measure tool ( reduction item bank , group item ) validation pre- final tool individual statistical technique ( content validity , perceive validity , structure validity , internal consistency ) .- Third stage : psychometric validation final tool make survey conducted subject CKD , age 18 old . These patient enrol hemodialysis center participant usual hemodialysis session . A total 30 patient interview qualitative step develop bank item 30 patient participate validation pre-final tool . Then 100 patient include develop final measurement tool structure validation 150 patient ask analyze psychometric property ( validity , reliability sensitivity change ) .The last two stage work multicentric . For development item bank meter validation final tool cross-sectional survey sufficient . For validation phase , longitudinal follow-up require , collection day 0 , 7 day interval ( test - retest ) collection 6 month predictive validity assessment phase sensitivity change . Analysis result help define applicability criterion acceptability know validity specific instrument say , content validity , perceive validity , structure validity , discriminant validity , reliability explore internal consistency stability time . Longitudinal follow-up patient expect also assess predictive validity sensitivity change . Statistical analysis plan : Statistical analysis data use so-called classical method adapt . The study applicability instrument involve description relevant parameter . The validity instrument use follow technique : statistical technique implement factor analysis reduction item , check dimensionality field , check structural validity . Analysis variance equivalent study discriminative ability . Reliability explore Cronbach alpha internal consistency . For study reproducibility , intraclass correlation coefficient use . Multivariate analysis Cox model logistic regression perform investigate predictive validity sensitivity change . Expected result prospect : The investigator believe improve hemodialysis session individually could ultimately improve overall quality life patient . Hemodialysis treatment palliative treatment ( curative treatment kidney transplantation ) , medical team care option , improve quality session therefore experience dialysis session . The investigator believe creation measurement tool validation essential future evaluation action . This tool useful entire Francophone community nephrologist .</detailed_description>
