	<brief_title>CROSSFIRE Trial : Comparing Efficacy Irreversible Electroporation With Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer high mortality rate major cancer ; 94 % pancreatic cancer patient die within five year diagnosis , 74 % within first year diagnosis ; 6 % survive five year . Surgical resection curative option . However , 40 % present non-metastatic locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma ( LAPC ; AJCC stage III ) . These patient eligible surgical resection tumor involve major blood vessel superior mesenteric artery , celiac axis , common hepatic artery and/or portal vein . These patient currently treat palliative chemotherapy first line therapy . Focal therapy use external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) may improve survival , outcome remain poor . Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SABR ) form EBRT important advantage conventional radiotherapy precise great biological dose delivery hence less toxicity presumably well outcome . For patient diagnosed LAPC , combination chemotherapy plus local tumor destruction use irreversible electroporation ( IRE ) , novel tumor ablation technique , recently show great promise . IRE base permeabilization cell membrane electrical pulse lead apoptosis . Theoretically , IRE affect viable tumor tissue , leave surround vital structure relatively intact . It therefore consider cause less morbidity thermal ablative strategy . The CROSSFIRE-trial prospective , randomize control phase-II/III trial.The primary aim study compare efficacy chemotherapy IRE ( experimental arm ) efficacy chemotherapy radiation ( control arm ) patient locally advanced , non-resectable , non-metastasized , pancreatic cancer . In total , 138 patient histologically proven locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( AJCC stage III ) , age ≥ 18 year include . Patients specific cardiac history ( arrhythmias , pacemaker ) , pre-existent ECG-abnormalities and/or non-retrievable metallic self-expanding biliary stent exclude participation . Patients randomly allocate receive either chemotherapy radiation ( control arm ) chemotherapy IRE ( experimental arm ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Radiologic confirmation LAPC least ceCT chest abdomen ( upper abdomen scan accord dedicate 3mm slice multiphase pancreatic tumor protocol ) ; Maximum tumor diameter ≤ 5 cm ; Histological cytological confirmation pancreatic adenocarcinoma ; Age &gt; 18 year ; ASAclassification 0 3 ; World Health Organisation scale ( WHO ) performance status 0 1 ; Adequate bile drainage case biliary obstruction ; Written inform consent ; Resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma discuss multidisciplinary hepatobiliary team ; The presence suspect lymph node Stage IV pancreatic carcinoma ; Transmucosal tumor invasion surround duodenum stomach ; History epilepsy ; History cardiac disease : Congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA class 2 ; Active Coronary Artery Disease ( define myocardial infarction within 6 month prior screen ) ; Ventricular cardiac arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic therapy pacemaker ( beta blocker antihypertensive regimen permit ; atrial fibrillation contraindicate ) ; Uncontrolled hypertension . Blood pressure must ≤160/95 mmHg time screen stable antihypertensive regimen ; Compromised liver function ( e.g . sign portal hypertension , INR &gt; 1,5 without use anticoagulant , ascites ) ; Uncontrolled infection ( &gt; grade 2 NCICTC version 3.0 ) ; Pregnant breastfeeding subject . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test perform within 7 day start treatment ; Immunotherapy prior procedure ; Radiotherapy prior study enrollment ; Previous surgical therapy pancreatic cancer ; Second primary malignancy , except adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ carcinoma cervis uteri malignancy treat least 5 year previously without sign recurrence ; Allergic contrast agent . Any implanted stimulation device ; Any condition unstable could jeopardize safety subject compliance study ; Nonremovable Self Expanding Metal biliary Stent ( SEMS ) , remove surgery . Contraindications MRI since safety data 0.35 Tesla MRI scanner available electronic device pacemaker implant defibrillator , deep brain stimulators , cochlear implant , constitutes absolute contraindication study , even device consider safe MRI scan high field strength . Patients metallic foreign body eye , aneurysm clip brain , MRI scan since magnetic field may dislodge metal Patients severe claustrophobia may able tolerate MRI scan Patients hip prosthesis eligible MRI scan</criteria>
