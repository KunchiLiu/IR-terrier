	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) final common pathway cardiovascular ( CV ) diseases lead cause CV hospitalization Singapore worldwide , mortality rate rival cancer ( &gt; 50 % mortality 5 year ) . Also similar cancer , HF stag disease early detection treatment vital prevention disease progression Stage A ( risk factor ) Stage B ( subclinical structural heart disease ) Stage C ( symptomatic HF ) . Cardiac image critical detection early subclinical disease . There limited understanding mechanism underlie disease progression effective therapy limit , particularly half HF population preserve ejection fraction ( HFPEF `` diastolic HF '' ) effective therapy date ( contrast HF reduce ejection fraction [ HFREF ] `` systolic HF '' ) . The investigator overall aim build Singapore 's competitive advantage advance cardiac imaging , genetic molecular study develop integrate `` one -stop '' platform span human large small animal model , dedicate deepen understand CV disease progression , discovery new target repurposing drug .</detailed_description>
