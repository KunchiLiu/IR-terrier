	<brief_summary>This trial sequential multiple assignment randomize trial ( SMART ) , examine response differ dos behavioral cancer pain intervention ( Pain Coping Skills Training [ PCST ] ) subsequent response-based adjustment dos . Cancer patient pain initially randomize receive either PCST-Full PCST-Brief . Participants report pain reduction initially assign intervention re-randomized receive either maintenance increase level intervention . Participants report pain reduction initially assign intervention re-randomized either maintenance dose treatment . Intervention response compare across condition use standard two-sided , two-sample t-test . Techniques typically use SMART study use compare intervention dosage sequence across PCTS adjust initial dosage base patient response . The risk safety issue trial low limited common psychosocial intervention ( e.g. , loss confidentiality ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The incidence moderate severe pain cancer patient remain great 50 % . NIH guideline recommend implementation behavioral cancer pain intervention patient care . Yet , implementation remain low . Evidence patient dose-response ( i.e. , number session , skill ) , intervention adaption base initial response , understand personal characteristic related differ dose-response improve implementation optimize behavioral intervention delivery . This trial sequential multiple assignment randomize trial ( SMART ) , examine response differ dos behavioral cancer pain intervention ( Pain Coping Skills Training [ PCST ] ) subsequent response-based adjustment dos . Cancer patient pain ( N=327 ) initially randomize receive either PCST-Full PCST-Brief . Participants respond ( &lt; 30 % pain reduction ) initially assign intervention re-randomized receive either maintenance ( i.e. , booster session focus problem solve skill reinforcement ) increase level intervention ( i.e. , additional session skill ) . Participants respond ( &gt; 30 % pain reduction ) initially assign intervention re-randomized either maintenance dose treatment . Intervention response ( % reduction pain ) compare across condition use standard two-sided , two-sample t-test . Techniques typically use SMART study use compare intervention dosage sequence across PCTS adjust initial dosage base patient response . The risk safety issue trial low limited common psychosocial intervention ( e.g. , loss confidentiality ) .</detailed_description>
