	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility implement structured exercise program evaluate recruitment retention , exercise program adherence , sustainability , adverse event , implementation challenge . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To calculate preliminary effect size impact exercise program patient hematologic malignancy undergo therapy , measure : - Cancer Aging Research Group ( CARG ) Geriatric Assessment Tool parameter . - Change Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) . - Number severity fall . - Impact motivation self-efficacy adherence . - Hospital readmission rate ( applicable ) . - Length inpatient stay ( applicable ) . - Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) Health relate quality life ( HRQL ) . - Correlative analysis peripheral blood biomarkers age inflammation ( cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A [ p16 ] , inflammatory biomarkers , immunosenescence , micro [ mi ] ribonucleic acid [ RNA ] ) . OUTLINE : Patients attend 8 physical therapy visit twice monthly 4 month transplant . Patients also undergo individualized exercise program home 6 month . The program comprise 3 main component : walk 30 minute twice week , strengthen balance retrain exercise 30 minute three time week . After completion study , patient follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
