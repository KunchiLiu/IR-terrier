	<detailed_description>Right ventricular ( RV ) function increasingly recognize play important role clinical status long-term outcome patient congenital heart disease ( CHD ) well ischemic cardiomyopathy leave ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction . However , quantitation RV characteristic function , particular regional RV characteristic function , still challenge due complex morphology thin wall coarse trabeculations . The remarkable improvement survival CHD patient lead continuously grow number grown-up CHD . In addition , defect ( e.g. , Ebstein 's anomaly ) may diagnose first time adult . Majority CHD patient face lifetime problem include RV dilation , ventricular arrhythmia , sudden cardiac death . Therefore , accurate depiction RV remodel process facilitate disease would aid surveillance monitoring therapeutic efficacy . CHD patient , even corrective surgery , need lifetime surveillance yearly clinical evaluation . Currently , clinical evaluation include ECG pulse oximetries alongside clinical examination . Investigation anatomy physiology RV change invasive study ( right heart catheterization ) noninvasive image technique include : echocardiography , nuclear scintigraphy , compute tomography , cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) image . In short , echocardiography largely operator dependent suffers poor inter-study reproducibility . The complex geometry RV make difficult accurately quantify remodel intervention . Nuclear scintigraphy compute tomography constrain need ionize radiation well poor temporal resolution technique . CMR consider golden reference technique RV volume ejection fraction . From current state-of-the-art CMR , generation RV volume ejection fraction , global measure RV remodeling , require extensive manual contouring . Most important , lacking regional RV remodeling measure .</detailed_description>
