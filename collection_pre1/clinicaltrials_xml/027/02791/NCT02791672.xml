	<brief_summary>The pedicled latissimus dorsi flap piece tissue take back used reconstruct breast cancerous tissue remove . Over year , improvement surgical technique pain control decrease length stay hospital procedure . Recently , early discharge breast reconstruction use another similar pedicled flap , call transverse rectus abdominis flap , show safe , patient-centered , associate significant hospital cost-savings another Canadian group . With increase pressure hospital administrator weigh financial consideration treatment decision making , doctor must test cost-saving strategy order ensure patient satisfaction safety . Here , plan evaluate patient safety , satisfaction cost efficacy breast reconstruction use pedicled latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap . We hypothesize patient care plan allow safe cost-effective same-day discharge improve patient satisfaction autologous breast reconstruction use pedicled latissimus dorsi flap . After nearly 10 successful same-day discharge use flap , experience Ottawa Hospital suggest practice safe , increased patient satisfaction score , decrease narcotic use , short long term complication cost effective compare patient stay overnight . In present study , hope quantify result demonstrate day discharge cost effective strategy compromise patient safety satisfaction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The pedicled latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap reliable option autologous breast reconstruction mastectomy . Improvements technique postoperative analgesia decrease length hospital stay require procedure . Early discharge follow range procedure consistently show increase patient satisfaction , decrease perioperative complication rate , improve hospital cost-effectiveness . Specifically , early discharge breast reconstruction use another pedicled myocutaneous flap , transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap , show safe , patient-centered , associate significant hospital cost-savings another Canadian group . The balance financial saving patient safety/comfort study vigorously across many medical discipline . With increase pressure hospital administrator weigh financial consideration treatment decision making , clinician must empirically test cost-saving strategy order ensure patient satisfaction safety . Here , evaluate patient safety , satisfaction cost efficacy ambulatory breast reconstruction use pedicled latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap .</detailed_description>
