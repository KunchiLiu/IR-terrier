	<brief_summary>Head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) 4th high incidence cancer 6th cancer death male Taiwan . Because patient mainly middle-aged male , disease eventually result huge loss labor force , productivity huge burden family support medicinal cost . Unfortunately , incidence death HNSCC seem increase Taiwan . Currently , primary treatment HNSCC mainly surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy target therapy concurrent chemoradiotherapy . Compared oral cavity cancer , patient pharyngeal cancer would possibly harbor human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection well treatment outcome , prognosis survival clinically significance ; however , investigator 's report show quite opposite prognostic value oral cavity cancer . The inconsistent data urge u investigate . Fortunately , recent year , The investigator develop new method isolation detection circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) HNSCC patients.The investigator 's data find high level CTCs patient HNSCC might associate disease prognosis , response treatment distant metastasis . This novel tool enhances study address metastasis recurrence process HNSCC patient . However , investigator focus whether dynamic change CTCs specific surface marker CTCs , P16INK4A -positive CTCs clinically meaningful . Therefore , first year 3-year project , investigator utilize investigator 's develop device protocol isolate high-purity CTCs identify P16INK4A positivity CTCs . In follow 2 year project , investigator enroll 150 freshly diagnosed patient oral cavity , oropharyngeal , hypopharyngeal laryngeal cancer stage ( 75 P16 INK4A -positive 75 P16 INK4A -negative patient ) 30 healthy donor cell line test , analyze CTCs , background white blood cell signal , initial biopsied tissue P16INK4A positivity test . Further statistical test clinical condition ( disease status , treatment effect , progression distant metastasis death ) perform elucidate clinical significance . In addition , investigator also analyze habitual status alcohol ; cigarette betel nut use P16INK4A-positive CTCs attempt understand influence P16 INK4A status dynamically . Hopefully , investigator clarify clinical significance circulate P16INK4A expression status CTCs study provide new biomarker clinical cancer care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Clinical Relevance P16INK4A Expressing CTCs Detection Comparing With HPV Infection Cancer Tissue HNSCC Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Establish protocol practical platform longitudinally isolate , enumerate CTCs patient HPV+-head neck cancer treatment course . 2 . Elucidate clinical significance P16 INK4A -expressing CTCs cancer status treatment response . 3 . Verify dynamically monitor P16 status change anti-cancer treatment feasible clinically meaningful survival treatment response . 4 . Analyze different habitual condition , i.e . alcohol , cigarette betel nut use P16-expressing CTCs . 5 . Establish good model follow-up specific surface marker CTCs , could possibly utilized cancer particular marker ( i.e . CEA gastric cancer , Her2 breast cancer )</detailed_description>
