	<brief_summary>In last decade , transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) become increasingly utilized alternative procedure replace stenotic aortic valve . This study collect clinical information , DNA , blood urine sample ( throughout procedural hospitalization ) order investigate incidence acute kidney injury ( AKI ) patient undergo TAVR identify key clinical procedural predictor AKI . This study seek identify blood urine biomarkers use early detection AKI around time procedure . The study seek ass novel genetic variant associate development AKI TAVR . Finally study seek ass novel genetic variant biomarkers associate adverse cardiovascular event TAVR explore event may inter-relate acute kidney injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study enroll patient aortic stenosis undergo TAVR University Texas Southwestern Medical Center University Hospital . Development post-TAVR AKI define accord Kidney Disease : Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) SCr base urine output base criterion ascertain . Patients follow primary hospitalization 5 year follow TAVR adverse kidney outcomes well potentially related adverse cardiovascular outcome . Clinical procedural data collect study patient . All subject pair blood urine collection do pre-TAVR , 6 hour aortic valve prosthesis deployment , post-procedure day 1 2 . Subjects develop AKI also pair blood urine sample collect day 3 , 4 5 . Patients receive follow-up questionnaire mail email ask hospitalization well visit cardiology , nephrology primary care physician . Questionnaires also ask health-related quality life use validate study questionnaire . Patient follow-up occur regular interval 5 year TAVR procedure .</detailed_description>
