	<brief_summary>Heart failure major health care burden . It occur either normal reduced LV ejection fraction , depend different degree ventricular remodelling . The investigator recently publish new method , curvedness-based imaging . The investigator also report diagnostic utility curvedness-based image various cardiac disease . The investigator propose prospectively assess curvedness-based imaging diagnosis heart failure normal ejection fraction reduce ejection fraction , examine leave ventricular systolic diastolic function predict prognosis cohort HF patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Novel Automated &amp; Comprehensive Approach Ventricular Function Assessment Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure impose major global health care burden society suffer individual.In US , HF affect 5.7 million patient , lead cause hospitalization people 65 year , 25 % 50 % rate hospital readmission within 6 months.In Singapore , 1991 1998 , account 4.5 % hospital admission 2.5 % mortality geriatric age group.It confers annual mortality 10 % . The early diagnosis identification underlie etiology HF paramount importance ; cause require specific treatment may correctable . From updated American College Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline , question must address suspected HF patient : Is leave ventricular ejection fraction preserve reduce ? Is structure LV normal abnormal ? Are structural abnormality right ventricular ( RV ) abnormality could account clinical presentation ? Is LV global regional dysfunction extent ? Is etiology ischemic non-ischemic ? Cardiac image important HF diagnosis monitoring progress . Impaired pump function , express reduce left ventricular ejection fraction often use marker HF . About 50 % HF preserve EF.In situation , intricate comprehensive imaging involve measurement multiple diastolic systolic parameter , usually use echocardiography , may become necessary address question mention . Our solution expect result significant cost save HF patient . HF diagnosis still challenge , consist assessment medical family history , physical exam diagnostic imaging test . The investigator compare cost difference traditional way propose solution . The traditional diagnostic test include chest x-ray , BNP blood test , echocardiography , nuclear heart scan cardiac catheterization . In project , investigator estimate cost echocardiography , nuclear heart scan cardiac catheterization HF diagnosis . Based clinical experience , among 1000 patient undergo echocardiography , 50 % refer nuclear heart scan 30 % refer invasive cardiac catheterization . The cost whole workup estimate $ 1.95 million . If 1000 patient undergo propose CBI solution directly , cost estimate $ 1.4 million . The cost saving estimate S $ 400 per patient . Hence , investigator explore follow study : Primary aim : Assess LV systolic diastolic function curvedness-based image 120 HF patient reduce ejection fraction normal ejection fraction . Secondary aim : Evaluate utility curvedness-based imaging diagnosis etiology HF , gold standard gadolinium enhance CMR subgroup HF patient . Exploratory aim : Evaluate utility curvedness-based imaging prediction prognosis 6 month follow , clinical outcome include death , CV death HF re-admission .</detailed_description>
