	<brief_title>Smartphone Delivered In-home Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project aim determine smartphone-delivered cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) program could show similar clinical outcome in-person program low cost large population patient . Investigators also assess feasibility tailor virtual CR program small sample COPD participant also stand benefit absence establish pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) program . This randomize controlled clinical trial participant Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center applicable diagnosis cardiac pulmonary rehabilitation versus usual care study period . The study team plan simultaneously recruit two cohort participant refer CR ( Cohort A ) PR ( Cohort B ) take part in-home , virtual rehabilitation program . To compare intervention traditional CR , investigator perform observational cohort study patient already enrolled CHOICE program conventional CR . Furthermore , good understand potential impact intervention , investigator perform retrospective chart review patient refer CR past 5-years . Investigators seek address following : 1 . Determine whether home-based cardiac pulmonary rehabilitation program deliver smartphones feasible improves functional status . 2 . Determine education lifestyle counsel lead increase adherence prescribe follow-up , pharmacotherapy , quality life , self-efficacy lifestyle change . 3 . Determine home-based cardiac pulmonary rehabilitation program reduce health system utilization , include ED visit readmission rate .</detailed_description>
