	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) common [ affect 6 % general adult population ] cardiac disorder portion coronary artery block . Among population age 65 year , prevalence increase 19.8 % . The incidence CHD Singapore major country comparable . The prognosis CHD poor . CHD cause 1.2 million heart attack nearly 19 % death US . [ 2 ] In Singapore , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) account 30.4 % deaths 2011 , among , 19 % due CHD . In future , CVD deaths increase 24.2 million globally 2030 . Among , CHD death change 13.1 % 2010 14.9 % 2030 male ; 13.6 % 13.1 % female . The direct cost CHD estimate $ 87 billion indirect cost $ 70 billion US . Unless current trend halt reversed , million people die CHD US annually . Globally , majority CHD death develop country many life lose middle age . Invasive coronary angiography ( ICA ) , gold standard method delineate anatomical coronary stenosis . Fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) measurement pressure wire gold standard assessment physiological importance anatomical stenosis . Non-invasive computed tomography angiography ( CTA ) , diagnostic alternative invasive coronary angiography single multi-centre trial . CTA enable visualization coronary vessel two-dimensional ( 2D ) three-dimensional ( 3D ) format . Current available imaging technique CTA limit ability assess physiological stenosis . First , commonly use percent diameter stenosis describe extent coronary artery stenosis modest descriptor coronary stenosis incorporate lesion characteristic ( e.g . length , shape eccentricity ) effect stenosis series may greatly affect blood flow . From preliminary study , find diameter stenosis weakly correlate golden standard FFR invasive catheterization ( r = 0.30 ) . Second , percent diameter stenosis assessment usually give per specific coronary artery lesion , lesion manually identify expert reader . There method comprehensively assess entire coronary tree automate fashion without need manual input . We propose development Automatic CTA analyzer identify significant coronary stenosis coronary artery provide rapid triage patient suspect CHD . This analyzer also facilitate disease surveillance monitoring therapeutic efficacy . The propose integrated solution expect achieve earlier high accuracy detect severity coronary stenosis . From 2004 2007 alone , number annual CTA procedure US around 4.7 million . In National Heart Centre Singapore , perform 1000 CTA per year . Diameter stenosis CTA determine hemodynamic significance coronary artery disease . For example , even significant stenosis ( &gt; 50 % ) identify CTA , few 50 % lesion actually cause ischemia . Furthermore , many 20 % patient severe stenosis ( i.e. , &gt; 70 % ) CTA turn ischemia confirm ICA FFR . As result , patient risk refer ICA need .</detailed_description>
