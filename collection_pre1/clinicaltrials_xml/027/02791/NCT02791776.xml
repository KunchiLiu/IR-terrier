	<detailed_description>Idiopathic scoliosis deformity three plane space child 's spine scalable teenager growth . In adult cause severe deformity respiratory failure responsible disabling back pain . Scoliosis often idiopathic without cause find genetic origin identify . It detect school doctor , doctor pediatrician . The management base primarily monitor small angle discovery scoliosis orthopedic treatment progressive scoliosis specialize service pediatric orthopedics rehabilitation recommend HAS ( February 2008 ) . Surgical treatment reserve orthopedic treatment failure advance scoliosis discover late . The goal surgery reduce much possible distortion three plane space avoid progression deformity adulthood . Its principle correct deformity use instrumentation maintain time correction bone graft . This commonly call spinal fusion instrumentation . The instrumentation include vertebral anchor connect rod . Indications ask case often adolescence sometimes young child rarely adulthood . The procedure perform adolescence allows benefit flexible spine still allow good reduction deformation , less neurological risk good consolidation bony fusion guarantee stable income long term . Among types curve , thoracic scoliosis pose problem choose bend instrument . This choice essential element initial correction become long-term . It result compromise long instrumentation orchestrate deformation detriment mobility lumbar spine short instrumentation preserve mobility expense perhaps small reduction . These short instrumentation call selective thoracic instrumentation , choice support low vertebra vertebra instrumentation unsolved problem subject work . The immediate result posterior vertebral arthrodesis assess correction deformity three plane space : measuring angle curvature coronal plane , analyze return physiological kyphosis sagittal plane correction vertebral rotation horizontal plane . The result medium long term assess analyze maintenance correction deformity evolution spine underlying arthrodesis . This appreciate coronal sagittal balance , change support vertebra first non-instrumented vertebra evolution spine underlie uninstrumented . The problem choose support vertebra subject several study . They suggest regard technique currently use insufficient setback . The need sufficient number file minimum decline 5 year propose multicenter study conduct within framework Scoliosis Research Group ( SRG ) result roundtable next congress GES March 2015.
