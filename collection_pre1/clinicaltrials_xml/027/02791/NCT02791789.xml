	<brief_title>SEMATIC Pilot Study Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Innovative Edutainment Software</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SEMATIC innovative collaborative project aim develop edutainment software learn word phrase logic game . This software design child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) normal prerequisite learn read ( say : understanding word , verbal expression phonological awareness ) . In addition , project base hyper competence visual field child ASD provide playful computer support access specific visual interest child . IT support useful tool stable predictable focus child 's attention ASD . To date , none learn read software exist child ASD . This project base innovative theoretical methodological assumption . These assumption derive directly observation , clinical knowledge autistic disorder , testimony family individual Asperger Syndrome Autism High Level contribution scientific literature field autism . This software design improve secondary verbal child ASD well medical care ( speech therapist neuropsychological ) . The SEMATIC software could integrate traditional care child ASD . This project part approach 'action research ' . Indeed , research aim boost health care team train cognitive characteristic child ASD use computer support ( SEMATIC ) . Fifteen child ASD recruit various institution PACA region ( department 06 83 ) participate study . All participant use software institution usually support also home . Thus interest SEMATIC project develop learning word phrase computer use logic game go towards learn read code child ASD usual prerequisite . This pilot study . There currently equivalent method measuring change . The assessment learn carry different time protocol . Tests create specifically need study use . Some test commonly use speech therapy neuropsychological assessment ( Standard tool validate recommendation HAS , 2005 ) also use include topic define characteristic population study .</detailed_description>
