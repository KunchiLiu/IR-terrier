	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) progressive atherosclerotic disease lower limbs affect 8 10 million Americans , prevalent progress quickly patient diabetes mellitus ( DM ) . There critical need standard non-invasive approach ass response treatment three-dimensional ( 3D ) perfusion vascular territory foot PAD patient . Assessing response treatment particularly important DM patient , suffer poor distal runoff often require distal revascularization achieve limb salvage . In clinical study , investigator evaluate low extremity skeletal muscle perfusion foot healthy control PAD patient undergo revascularization use conventional sodium iodide SPECT/CT imaging , well dynamic SPECT/CT imaging unique cadmium zinc telluride ( CZT ) system . Healthy control subject ( n=15 ) recruit Yale University great New Haven area . In addition healthy control subject , 35 PAD patient previously diagnose diabetes recruit Vascular Surgery Interventional Cardiology Yale-New Haven Hospital . Patients undergo revascularization procedure identify asked participate imaging study prior revascularization procedure image 1-3 day follow revascularization , prior hospital discharge . Subjects undergo rest perfusion image foot use two separate SPECT/CT system . They inject low dose radiotracer . In healthy control subject , arterial blood continuously sample radial artery calculation blood input function K1 value foot angiosomes . Additionally , sample heat venous `` arterialize '' blood hand vein retrograde evaluate potential heat venous blood calculation blood input function , thus eliminate need arterial access future PAD patient study .</detailed_description>
