	<brief_summary>Young child Ethiopia lack sufficient protein micronutrient growth development . The overall purpose ass effect promote egg eggshell powder consumption improve nutritional status child 6 15 month Halaba Special Woreda , Southern Ethiopia . The hypothesis provide chicken produce egg ( egg eggshell ) young child improve growth otherwise malnourish young child . Upon provide chicken , nutritional status young child prior intervention ( 6 month ) assess . Identification knowledge , attitude practice ( KAP ) mother egg eggshell powder consumption child intervention intervention group do . Caregivers instruct give child 1 egg ( cook ) 1/4 `` bottle cap '' eggshell ( 500 mg calcium ) per day intervention . Hemoglobin measure indicator overall nutritional status . Throughout study , problem arise keep chicken record order ass feasibility practicality raise chicken way improve nutritional status young child . The study novel investigator provide way increase protein , increase micronutrient , use eggshell source calcium .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Young child Ethiopia lack sufficient protein micronutrient growth development.The study adopt 6-month cluster-randomized control trial design . There treatment group ( community receive chicken ) control group ( chickens 6 month study ) . Study participant recruit child age 6-15 month old , resident 6 Kebeles cluster . 6 , Control Intervention area randomly select . This age group select time introduction complementary food easy see clear effect egg child growth , rather choose old child . In Intervention group , child know allergic egg exclude study . The following measurement make baseline ( prior chicken ceremony intervention area ) month 6 : dietary assessment 24-hour recall child mother ; food frequency questionnaire diet diversity score ; hemoglobin test ( involve single finger prick ) child ; weight height ( young child , length ) ; knowledge attitude question egg egg-shell nutrition . At baseline , caregiver answer demographic question . Monthly , monitor egg eggshell consumption child well measurement height ( length ) , structure questionnaire morbidity . In intervention group , caregiver instruct provide one egg small amount eggshell ( provide 500 mg calcium ) . At 9 month , research assistant visit Intervention community informally gather data chicken use , participant child 's health status ( follow-up morbidity data ) . Throughout data collect infection rate , possibility improvement due good nutrition also awareness bring chicken community could pose risk young child . As well , formal follow-up observation one community site focus group discussion key informant interview , way assess feasibility practically chicken donation future . This convenience sample represent participant parent , community leader , Agriculture Extension worker , Health extension worker , person directly involve . Those targeted interview extension worker feedback provide , focus group hold others able attend focus group session . Data check provide MSc student local supervisor plan study directly involve day-to-day run intervention . The student write SOPs procedure . Missing data account community base study group mean use outcome measurement . Comparing two means/the difference mean intervention control group do use independent two sample t-test . Continuous outcome analyze use pair t-test . Bivariate analysis use see overall effect independent variable multivariate analysis ( multiple linear regression ) do see effect independent variable . Both crude adjust risk ratio 95 % confidence interval report . Other variable relevant finding also analyze use proper statistical test/analysis technique report accordingly . P-value le 0.05 take significant</detailed_description>
