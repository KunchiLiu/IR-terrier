	<brief_title>Advanced MRI Uteroplacental Flow , Perfusion , Oxygenation &amp; Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Decreased uteroplacental perfusion recognize antecedent event pregnancy ultimately result adverse outcome like fetal growth restriction , preeclampsia and/or preterm birth . This concept well support clinically identification spiral artery vascular lesion call acute atherosis . Current literature suggest event occur early investigator propose image use multiple technique relate flow early time point . The investigator propose individual either poor maternal vascular response and/or inadequate spiral artery remodel resultant inadequate placentation reduce uteroplacental perfusion . Given spiral artery draw vast majority blood flow gravid state , poor placentation would reflect total uteroplacental blood flow , early detection would allow design routine initiation novel preventive therapy early gestation improve pregnancy outcome . The goal research develop arsenal advanced ultrasound ( U/S ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) techniques compatible run simultaneously sequentially probe uteroplacental health overcome limitation pose obesity motion . While safety concern remain MRI , particularly first trimester , investigator front-load developmental optimization study primate model `` proof principle '' translate human ; conservative approach key achieve paradigm shift outcome . A pilot study complete prior main study evaluate U/S Doppler two dimensional phase contrast ( 2D PC ) MRI Uteroplacental Blood Flow ( UPBF ) measure include contribution ovarian artery addition uterine artery . The investigator match image measure clinical data blood urine sample post-hoc analysis cytokine tissue-specific metalloproteases , correlation inform differential diagnosis distinct disease mechanism may otherwise show common imaging outcome . At end study lean obese woman , study team inevitably outcomes categorized Fetal Growth Restriction ( FGR ) , hypertensive and/or preeclampsia ( PE ) , perhaps preterm and/or rarely stillbirth outcome . Using combination approach determine : 1 ) optimal combination image method practical sufficiently safe use human ; 2 ) new data derive informative beyond currently available clinically ; 3 ) point gestation abnormality may detect new method relative current standard clinical measure and/or diagnosis ; 4 ) If image outcomes predict specific complication , warn high risk general complication .</detailed_description>
