	<brief_summary>This multicenter multinational prospective two-arm matched-pair observational study aim establish prospective comparison active lipoprotein apheresis treatment approve conduct accord German guideline indication elevate Lp ( ) versus maximum tolerate lipid-lowering therapy standard care . Due prospective character inclusion control arm , first clinical study confirm relevance establish approach use lipoprotein apheresis subject effect reduce individual cardiovascular risk . The optimized management subject control group ( receive lipoprotein apheresis ) also help clarify controversial issue , extent intensive medical care per se influence occurence subsequent cardiovascular event . Primary objective trial evaluate clinical benefit Lp ( ) reduction use lipoprotein apheresis myocardial infarction , PCI , CABG death cardiovascular disease . The primary objective study evaluate clinical benefit weekly lipoprotein apheresis subject progressive cardiovascular disease , accepted German Federal Joint Committee indication subject elevate Lp ( ) . Comparator match subject maximum tolerated lipid lower therapy without access lipoprotein apheresis treatment . The clinical benefit define reduction composite endpoint major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) , define either myocardial infarction , PCI , CABG death cardiovascular disease period least 2 year completion visit 1b least 60 event primary end-point occur group B . If number least 60 documented primary endpoint event within 2 year completion enrolment occur , study continue number primary endpoint event accumulate .</brief_summary>
