	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND An inability consistently effectively communicate fundamental physical need major problem mechanically ventilate ICU patient . Patients rate 40 % communication session difficult third communication pain unsuccessful . Nurses initiate 86 % communication exchange typically difficult voiceless ICU patient initiate communication . Patients ICU therefore commonly suffer unrecognized pain discomfort , feeling loss control insecurity , depersonalization , anxiety , sleep disturbance , fear frustration . Caregivers also frequently report feel anxious frustrate able adequately assess need patient . This inability communicate effectively lead inappropriate use sedatives prolongation time spend ventilator , may lead increase ICU length stay cost . Furthermore , inability communicate caregiver hamper ability critically ill patient active participant treatment decision-making , include decision withdraw withhold life-sustaining treatment . The use picture board icon represent common patient need complaint ( pain , fear , hot/ cold , thirst , bedpan etc ) show improve nurse-patient communication patient postoperative period ventilator . These picture board widely available ICUs close thing current standard communication voiceless mechanically ventilated patient , purpose address fundamental physical emotional need . Recent pilot study describe use computer-assisted communication use touch sensitive screen , eye blink detector gaze tracker enable communication ICU patient . The majority patient hospital staff survey study indicate use computer-assisted communication device improve ability respond patient need address patient comfort . Gaze eye blink tracker system expensive , however , touch sensitive screen may suitable many ICU patient weakness restriction motor ability . Patients ICU , particularly neurological illness , frequently suffer significant weakness loss co-ordination , however , limit ability use arm hand indicate appropriate item board . While patient neuroICU frequently weak focal brain injury , quarter patient require mechanical ventilation ICUs may significant weakness critical illness neuropathy myopathy , limit ability use hand select appropriate icon picture board . There several patient population , however , use picture board touch screen impossible , include patient high spinal cord injury , advanced ALS brainstem stroke , voiceless , also typically useful motor function limb . These patient `` locked-in '' , vary degree , awake alert control bodily function ability articulate communicate use standard form communication . The use Brain Computer Interface ( BCI ) device facilitate communication `` voiceless '' patient recently generate interest . A BCI translate deliberate , voluntary modulation cerebral electrical activity , typically record electroencephalography ( EEG ) computer command . A variety BCI device use permit patient advance Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS ) , high spinal cord injury brainstem stroke locked-in-syndrome , voluntary use limb , communicate varying degree . These device typically evaluated rehabilitation setting , follow period acute medical illness , home . No study evaluate use BCI device assist communication typical physical emotional needs/ complaint critically ill . This significant , patient spinal cord injury stroke , initially admit ICU , potentially large number ICU patient use picture board finger contact system critical illness neuropathy/ myopathy acute brain injury cause weakness . Our focus create steady state visual evoke potential ( SSVEP ) base , wireless BCI system facilitate communication intubate ICU patients. , The wearable BCI device interest study function visual attention illustrative icon display electronic screen . The icon , may depict common ICU patient need , need reposition common patient complaint , pain , display symbol . The patient , thereby , communicate look specific item depict need complaint . This wearable device entirely noninvasive without significant risk patient , function record translate EEG signal . The device communicate wirelessly user interface ( UI ) either tablet flat screen TV monitor present every ICU patient room . The proposed prototype provide user interface include basic function typically use communication nurse patient ICU . STUDY DESIGN This translational pilot study Steady State Visual Evoked Potential ( SSVEP ) base BCI system facilitate communication intubate patient . After obtain informed consent patient legally authorize representative , 30 patient recruit medical , surgical , cardiac , cardiothoracic neurological intensive care unit University Michigan , Ann Arbor period 12 month . Approval obtain Institutional Review Board University Michigan ( HUM00095052 ) . Screening delirium ability participate study : Potential subject identify member primary ICU team , contact study investigator . Subjects need sedate medicine return full wakefulness prior evaluation . Patients meet eligibility criterion consent participate study undergo test investigator confirm patient sufficiently alert attentive communicate AND capable consistently select item volitional finger contact . The patient undergo screen evaluation BCI device confirm individual EEG signal detect interpreted device . Patient complaints/ need : The investigator evaluate ability subject accurately select specific need complaint 10 common needs/ complaint . 1 . `` I pain '' 2 . `` I difficulty breathe '' 3 . `` I need suction '' 4 . `` I need bowel movement '' 5 . `` I need pee/ pas urine '' 6 . `` I thirsty '' 7 . `` I hungry '' 8 . `` I need position bed change '' 9 . `` Raise head bed '' 10 . `` I need family bedside '' Picture board : Feasibility communication use BCI device evaluate use picture board illustrative icon represent 10 needs/ complaint standard comparison determine accuracy selection appropriate icon . The icon phrase picture board identical icon phrase BCI device SPECIFIC AIM 1 : To demonstrate feasibility use Steady State Visual Evoked Potential ( SSVEP ) base Brain Computer Interface ( BCI ) device facilitate communication common patient need alert mechanically ventilated patient Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) . Hypothesis 1 : At least 80 % alert mechanically ventilated patient able accurately select illustrative icon brain computer interface represent physical emotional need self-identified patient common trigger communication bedside nurse admission . Orientation BCI picture board : The patient initially familiarized picture board BCI device . Instruction use BCI device include demonstration UI , explanation icon UI mechanism selection icon , focus visual attention . Selection need/ complaint : Immediately follow orientation , test accuracy BCI device perform . Testing accuracy perform single time patient , use important need/ complaint patient . The patient ask identify BCI UI specific need complaint common reason request assistance bedside nurse admission , among 10 patient need/ complaint option provide . Selection `` None above/ Other '' permit , however , patient specifically instruct advance select need/ complaint applicable situation among 10 choice provide . The patient ask select SAME need/ complaint picture board use finger contact . SPECIFIC AIM 2 : Specific Aim 2 : To determine patient , family bedside nurse satisfaction communication use BCI device elicit open-ended feedback guide future device improvement . Hypothesis 2 : At least 70 % patient `` agree '' `` strongly agree '' statement `` The Brain computer interface device allow communicate need bedside nurse adequately '' . Immediately follow evaluation accuracy describe Specific Aim 1 , investigator evaluate patient , family bedside nurse satisfaction follow bedside use device primary communication tool 2 hour day 3 consecutive day . A delirium screen use CAM-ICU brief neurological examination confirm patient 's ability effectively use BCI device picture board perform prior use device picture board subsequent day ( day 2 3 ) . At end 3 day , patient , family member present nurse participate test provide short questionnaire . The patient questionnaire option read patient . Statistical Analysis : The proportion patient pass Step 2 screen also pass Step 3 calculate exact binomial 95 % confidence interval . A proportion least 70 % passing Step 3 screen initial threshold feasibility , base clinical estimate value . The median time , interquartile range , require orientation BCI device picture board calculate , comparison perform use Mann Whitney U-test . The proportion patient select icon BCI UI picture board calculate , exact binomial 95 % confidence interval . In determine accuracy use BCI device , binomial analysis include multiple study BCI estimate chance level 63 % ( α = 0.05 , 60 trial ) . Based also clinical estimate would minimum useful level accuracy communication device , threshold accuracy study least 80 % patient demonstrate concordance selection important need/ complaint BCI device picture board . Descriptive statistic use proportion patient select response satisfaction question .</detailed_description>
