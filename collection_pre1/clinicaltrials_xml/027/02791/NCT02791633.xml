	<brief_title>Recovery After Emergency Laparotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regaining baseline Health Related Quality Life ( HRQoL ) return 'normal life ' surgery vital importance patient . Knowledge trajectory degree long-term functional recovery follow emergency laparotomy , include regain optimal HRQoL limit research relate field do patient undergo plan surgery . Furthermore , comprehensive understanding pattern recovery restoration baseline HRQoL also important researcher wish assess full impact intervention order improve outcome follow emergency laparotomy . Assessing HRQoL surgical population remain challenge absence validate instrument . The investigator plan undertake feasibility study assess utilisation four patient questionnaire , well establish within surgical population , describe quality early long-term recovery follow emergency laparotomy . The investigator utilise QoR-15 describe short-term ( - hospital ) recovery metric version WHO-DAS WHOQOL-BREF describe long term disability free survival return towards baseline HRQoL . The Post-Operative Morbidity Survey ( POMS ) help capture onset complication different point recovery . The study also aim test feasibility assess impact pre-operative co-morbidities , age , quality peri-operative intra-operative care , surgical indication finding well post-operative complication long-term HRQoL .</detailed_description>
