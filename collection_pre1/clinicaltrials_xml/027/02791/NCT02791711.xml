	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate use nasal broadband glass HFNC ( High Flow Nasal Cannula ) initial management severe bronchiolitis infant admit ICU . Nasal HFNC deliver warm humidify gas nasal interface , greatly improve safety efficacy administer O2 . This device generate continuous positive pressure airway , reduce work breathing . The seal absence HFNC nasal interface improve patient comfort avoid nasal trauma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Nasal Broadband Glasses Initial Management Severe Bronchiolitis Infants Admitted ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bronchiolitis infant common potentially serious disease . It correspond acute pulmonary disease dyspnea usually viral ( 70 80 % Respiratory syncytial virus RSV infants less 1 year ) . It particularly affect infant 2 year . The 2001 consensus conference bronchiolitis 2006 management clarify criterion hospitalization simplify therapeutic attitude . These conference highlight importance humidification , nasopharyngeal desobstruction less severe form oxygen therapy others . Recent literature also show use noninvasive ventilation type CPAP ( Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ) nasal broadband nasal glass ( HFNC : High Flow Nasal canula ) severe form possible reduce work breathe child severe bronchiolitis use study `` / '' accompany significant decrease use invasive ventilation . The HFNC nasal CPAP deliver warm humidify gas nasal interface , greatly improve safety efficacy administer O2 . These device generate continuous positive pressure airway , decrease work breathing . The seal absence HFNC nasal interface improve patient comfort avoid nasal trauma , sometimes encounter nasal CPAP interface . The HFNC simple , effective safe , commonly use severe bronchiolitis admit ICU ( Intensive Care Unit ) . However instead technique yet well define . The investigator assume use HFNC severe bronchiolitis first line allow sufficient respiratory improvement avoid recourse technical assistance ventilatory binding .</detailed_description>
