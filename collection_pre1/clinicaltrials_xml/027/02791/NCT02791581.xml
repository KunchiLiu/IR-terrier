	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Injury , Exercise Intolerance Fatigue After Adjuvant Chemotherapy Stage I-III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>840 woman age ≥18 year old scheduled receive Adj-C Stage I-III breast cancer comparison population 160 woman without cancer ( 1,000 total ) . Equal number woman recruit aged &lt; 52 vs. &gt; 52 . At baseline , innovative MRI measure CV function ( LV aorta ) ; measurement submaximal ( 6-minute walk ) , half cohort , maximal ( peak VO2 ) exercise capacity ; questionnaire data ass fatigue behavioral psychosocial risk factor ; biomarkers collect . Measurements repeat 3±1 , 12±2 ( completion radiation ) 24±2 month initiation Adj-C . This study assess relevance pre-existing factor age , black/white race , hypertension , smoking ( yes/no ) , diabetes , coronary artery disease , menopause status , CV medication , physical activity study outcome . Also , study assess dynamic change modifiable CV risk factor ( include BMI , blood pressure , serum lipid , serum glucose , physical activity , psychosocial factor , lifestyle behavior ) , cancer treatment include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy , surgery .</detailed_description>
