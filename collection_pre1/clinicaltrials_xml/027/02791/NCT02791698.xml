	<brief_title>The Accuracy Late Night Urinary Free Cortisol/Creatinine Hair Cortisol Cushing 's Syndrome Diagnosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>24h-Urine free cortisol ( 24h-UFC ) screen test may turn normal Cushing 's syndrome ( CS ) patient , probably due high variability cyclicity cortisol secretion . To rule cyclic cortisol secretion , recommendation repeat 24h-UFC measurement different several occasion . As 24h-UFC technically inconvenient , especially elderly woman , compliance may optimal , result could falsely low especially collection properly conduct . Alternatively , status cortisol circadian rhythm urinary cortisol secretion may assess non-invasive convenient manner measurement late even urinary free cortisol concentration/creatinine concentration ( Late-UFC ) . These measurement useful screen outpatient CS , performances properly enough validate . It appear assessment Late-UFC offer non-invasive convenient diagnostic tool evaluate cortisol circadian rhythm urinary cortisol secretion ambulatory population , especially case patient 24h-UFC repeat yet technically convenient perform . Hair sample testing gain increase attention recognition last 20 year , especially detect illegal drug use forensic purpose . This hair provide relatively long-term retrospective record level various bio-markers body . In light forego evidence , suggest hair cortisol measurement could novel method assess dynamic systemic cortisol exposure , could provide unique historical information variation cyclicity cortisol exposure . The investigator conduct prospective cohort study include patient referred outpatient endocrinology clinic medical evaluation due CS suspicion adrenal incidentaloma evaluation . Participants ask provide informed consent study enrollment . All Participants ask perform routine screening test CS diagnosis . On day participant collect 24h-UFC , ask empty urinary bladder 22:00 hour urinary collection bottle , give single urinary sample 24:00 hour Late-UFC determination . Immediately study enrollment , hair sample approximately 100-150 strand 2-3 cm long collect posterior vertex , cortisol concentration hair determine . All patient enrol diagnosed `` CS '' , `` Pseudo-Cushing 's syndrome '' `` undermined '' . CS classify ACTH-dependent CS ACTH-independent CS . ACTH-dependent CS diagnose least two screen test CS positive ( include Late-UFC HC ) , normal elevate basal plasma ACTH concentration , positive ACTH stain histology and/or post-surgical hypoadrenalism . ACTH-independent CS diagnose least one screen test positive , depressed basal plasma ACTH concentration ( ACTH concentration 2.2 pmol/L ) patient adrenal-post-surgical hypoadrenalism . Patients diagnose `` Pseudo-Cushing 's syndrome '' one screen test positive least three test perform , patient harbor typical feature CS , deterioration biochemical clinical status study follow-up . Patients diagnose `` undermined '' harbor two positive screening test , yet clinical biochemical profile support definitive diagnosis . To address question study , investigator compare two group `` CS '' `` Pseudo-Cushing 's syndrome '' determine sensitivity , specificity diagnostic accuracy Late-UFC Hair cortisol differentiate Cushing 's syndrome Pseudo-Cushing 's syndrome .</detailed_description>
