	<brief_summary>CFD simulation study provide detailed hemodynamics information , obtain cardiac image alone . The investigator hypothesize propose simulation provide strong correlation hemodynamic parameter , WSSG SPA , clinically identify graft stenosis . These correlation allow investigator identify future patient high risk graft stenosis lead future research optimize refine surgical plan , find optimal proximal distal anastomosis location , optimal graft length diameter , could lead improved longevity graft . Once CFD couple shape optimizer validate , could part surgical simulator help train next generation physician . It could provide new viewpoint assess whether modified surgical technique well . It could also aid design evaluate vascular medical device , include stent , artificial graft , etc. , would lead good surgical outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation Role Hemodynamics Re-stenosis CABG Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since introduction saphenous vein graft late 1960s , CABG , without arterial conduit , remain gold standard management intractable angina due coronary artery occlusive disease . According statistic American Heart Association , 571,000 bypass procedure perform 355,000 patient 1999 . In Singapore , 831 CABG surgery carry 2011 . With age society , number bypass operation suspect keep increase year . However , CABG without complication . The saphenous vein , commonly use vessel grafting , provide palliation ongoing process . Approximately 15 % 20 % saphenous vein graft occlude first year . An additional 2 % 5 % graft occlude year 2 10 year postoperatively . At 10 14 year , 50 % graft occlude . Similar data report 2011 ACCF/AHA CABG guideline . Although thrombosis , intimal hyperplasia atherosclerosis find pathological examination , exact mechanism stenosis still fully understood . The investigator hypothesize localized hemodynamic parameter relate site graft occlusion . Hemodynamic parameter propound involved localization arterial stenosis literature . High wall shear stress find lead abnormal endothelia cell Fry study thoracic aorta dog . Intimal thicken atherosclerosis find develop low WSS region study stenosis postmortem human carotid bifurcation , synthetic graft dog 's carotid artery human coronary artery . Both high low WSS segment find interplay plaque development human coronary artery . Bovine aortic endothelial cell density find increase high wall shear stress gradient region Depaola colleague . Significantly increase WSSG find throat cervical carotid stenosis Schirmer colleague 8 patient . Stress phase angle propose useful indicator predict site prone atherosclerosis Torii et al . investigate patient 's right coronary artery stenosis . Low-density lipoprotein transportation propose useful indicator predict site prone atherosclerosis human leave coronary artery Olgac colleague . All hemodynamic parameter related force act endocellar cell , especially wall shear stress . Signaling pathway propose , mediate mechano- chemical transduction endothelial cell response disturb WSS . Among WSS-related parameter , WSSG SPA may important , WSSG measure impact change surface force , SPA refer phase angle WSS WCS . Therefore direct study human CABG necessary provide strong correlation graft stenosis hemodynamic parameter , would helpful identify patient high risk re-stenosis optimize surgery mechanical standpoint . The current project aim fill gap .</detailed_description>
