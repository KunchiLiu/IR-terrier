	<brief_summary>This trial design evaluate , adult participant Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) inadequate glycemic control sub-maximal metformin mono-therapy ( 1000 mg/day ) , effect up-titration metformin plus addition sitagliptin compare up-titration metformin alone glycemic control . The primary hypothesis study up-titration metformin 2000 mg/day ( 1000 mg , twice daily [ b.i.d ] ) plus addition sitagliptin 100 mg/day provide great reduction hemoglobin A1C ( A1C ) compare metformin up-titration alone treatment safe well-tolerated .</brief_summary>
