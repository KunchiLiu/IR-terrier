	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation common disease age population severe implication leave untreated lead embolic stroke embolic phenomenon . Embolic stroke particular severe implication community cost care immobile patient extremely high . Atrial fibrillation typically begin Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( PAF ) , make early detection extremely difficult PAF may occur transiently initial stage . Long term continuous ECG monitoring currently require week detect early PAF . Current device typically need implant ( loop recorder ) sensitive enough detect infrequent episode PAF . New generation ECG remote device ( non-invasive ) however available wearable long period send data directly database centralize collection analysis data . The aim study use device evaluate incidence PAF different population patient , patient wear send continuous ECG data period week central database , across several public hospital Singapore .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The implication PAF detection individual huge individual community increase risk embolic stroke embolic phenomenon . Once detect , intervention take low individual 's clinical risk decrease clinical burden community . The lack suitable tool large population cohort lead likely underestimation PAF various patient population . This study specifically address characterize different incidence PAF various patient population hence help target risk group earlier screen intervention . Patients HF likely general population develop AF . Conversely AF also strong independent risk factor subsequent development HF . In Heart Failure ( HF ) patient , later development AF associate increased mortality . Preexisting HF adversely affect survival individual AF . Both HF reduce ejection fraction ( HFrEF ) Heart Failure Preserved Ejection Fraction ( HFpEF ) patient great risk AF . There direct relationship functional state ( show NYHA class ) prevalence AF patient HF progress 4 % NYHA class I 40 % NYHA class IV . Acute HF decompensation patient prior HF due AF precipitant 5.4 % case single center study . Knowing true prevalence AF HF allow u plan strategy reduce clinical burden HF .</detailed_description>
