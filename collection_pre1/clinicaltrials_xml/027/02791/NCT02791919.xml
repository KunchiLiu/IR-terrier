	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose wee1 kinase inhibitor AZD1775 give together fludarabine , cytarabine , filgrastim ( FLAG ) combination chemotherapy treat child , adolescent young adult relapse refractory acute myeloid leukemia . Wee1 kinase inhibitor AZD1775 may help combination chemotherapy work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . Drugs use chemotherapy , fludarabine cytarabine , may prevent tumor cell multiply damage deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) , turn stops tumor grow . Giving wee1 kinase inhibitor AZD1775 FLAG chemotherapy may work well treat patient acute myeloid leukemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend phase 2 dose wee1 kinase inhibitor AZD1775 ( AZD1775 ) administer orally daily 5 day combination FLAG ( fludarabine , cytarabine , filgrastim ) chemotherapy child adolescent recurrent refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . II . To define describe toxicity AZD1775 combination FLAG chemotherapy administer schedule . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics AZD1775 combination FLAG chemotherapy pediatric patient relapse refractory AML . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity AZD1775 plus FLAG within confines phase 1 study . II . To evaluate pharmacodynamic biomarkers wee1 inhibition administration AZD1775 include cyclin-dependent kinase 1 ( CDC2 ) phosphorylation tyrosine 15 ( Tyr15 ) induction gamma H2AX pre- post-treatment leukemic blast . III . To explore mechanisms apoptosis induction cell death leukemic blast treat AZD1775 plus chemotherapy . IV . To identify genomic alteration leukemic blast may correlate response therapy AZD1775 plus FLAG chemotherapy . OULTINE : This phase I dose escalation study wee1 kinase inhibitor AZD1775 . Patients receive filgrastim intravenously ( IV ) subcutaneously ( SC ) daily , fludarabine intravenously IV 30 minute , cytarabine IV 1-3 hour wee1 kinase inhibitor AZD1775 orally ( PO ) day 1-5 . Patients meet criterion complete remission ( CR ) , complete remission partial recovery platelet count ( CRp ) partial response ( PR ) may receive second course therapy . Courses repeat every 28 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
