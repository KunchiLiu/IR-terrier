	<brief_title>Improving Quality Care Adults With Inflammatory Bowel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To demonstrate impact Adult Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) Learning Health System approach study collaborator design , build , implement , evaluate 30 IBD care sit follow four key component IBD Learning Health System : 1 ) Health Information Technology ( HIT ) environment `` feed-forward '' PROs clinical data use point care integrate registry ( IBD Plexus ) ; 2 ) decision-support dashboard use patient clinician real time coproduce care ; 3 ) meaningful report patient clinician ; 4 ) multi-stakeholder collaborative network improvement research . The Learning Health System model also include one additional component desire , yet outside scope project ; 5 ) patient facilitate network connect patient convenience . Prior work Sweden US show successful uptake model offer important benefit . Patients able use web-based tool monitor health manage care , securely share data clinician timely manner , visualize outcome matter , compare result people . Clinicians new information improve ability track patient outcomes cost time ; use PRO data support pre-visit planning , share decision-making point care , post-visit monitoring ; receive comparative performance report support quality improvement , public reporting , professional development . Researchers benefit PROs cost data add data registry support clinical , translational , comparative effectiveness research . Study collaborator evaluate determine technological , social/community , policy roadmap allow implementation system scale across multiple , diverse clinical setting . Understanding factor pave way broad uptake feed-forward coproduction information system support coproduction optimal health high value care IBD patient .</detailed_description>
