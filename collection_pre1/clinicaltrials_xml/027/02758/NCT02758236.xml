Patients present cough 2 week long least one additional TB symptom chest X-ray suggestive TB , invite enrol study . The sign informed consent designate willingness participate study . Enrolled subject produce sputum bacteriological examination M. tuberculosis AFB , culture Xpert . The sputum also test Xpert drug resistance test . If culture positive , conventional DST perform , M. tuberculosis isolates store spoligotyping future research TB . All bacteriologicaly confirm subject follow outcome assessment . For enrolled subject chest X-ray result , demographic data , TB co-morbidities , symptom , nutritional status , treatment regimen , compliance outcome collect . In addition , sputum , blood urine also collect storage . To estimate proportion MDR-TB amongst new previously treat TB case . 1 . To evaluate accuracy clinical diagnosis compare clinically define TB laboratory confirm TB . 2 . To compare AFB Xpert MTB/RIF TB diagnostic test culture result . 3 . To estimate sensitivity specificity Xpert MTB/RIF detect Rif susceptibility DST . 4 . To estimate proportion cure , complete , fail , die lose follow treatment outcomes DS-TB DR-TB case 5 .
