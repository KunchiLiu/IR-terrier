	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well nivolumab brentuximab vedotin work treat old patient untreated Hodgkin lymphoma . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab , may block cancer growth different way target certain cell . Biological therapy , brentuximab vedotin , use substance make live organism may stimulate suppress immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Nivolumab brentuximab vedotin may work good treat old patient untreated Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab Brentuximab Vedotin Treating Older Patients With Untreated Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy base complete metabolic remission ( CMR ) rate brentuximab vedotin/nivolumab previously untreated Hodgkin lymphoma patient 60 year age old , consider unsuitable standard chemotherapy low cardiac ejection fraction ( &lt; 50 % ) impair pulmonary renal function . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . The overall response rate ( CMR + partial metabolic response [ PMR ] ) . II . Safety tolerability regimen patient population . III . Duration response ( DOR ) . IV . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) . V. Overall survival ( OS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. T-cell/cytokine - peripheral blood specimen use assess T-cell activation cytokine regulation measure treatment effect . II . Biomarkers - intratumoral cell population , genetic variability , serum cytokine T-cell activation evaluate identify potential biomarkers correlate response therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute nivolumab IV 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 7 course 6-8 week course 8 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 , 60 , 90 , 150 , 210 , 270 day , every 90 day 2 year , every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
