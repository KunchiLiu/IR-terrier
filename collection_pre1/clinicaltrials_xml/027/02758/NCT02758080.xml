	<brief_summary>A molecular profile patient hematologic malignancy , standard-of-care fail , identify use next generation sequence . Patients assign early clinical trial target agent base molecular profile physician 's choice . The improvement outcomes intention-to-treat population investigate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Matching Patients With Hematologic Malignancy Adequate Clinical Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most hematologic malignancy patient become incurable standard treatment disease course . Although patient recommended participate early phase clinical trial , response rate report 4 6 percent . Over several decade , lot cancer drive mutation identify , target agent directed mutation continuously develop study many clinical trial . Most clinical trial recruit participant regardless mutational status . Recently , however , participant recruit recent clinical trial accord presence specific mutation . The response rate recent clinical trial 12-75 % . In pragmatic clinical trial , cancer drive mutation hematologic malignancy patient identify use next generation sequencing , assign patient appropriate clinical trial anticipated exhibit best response . The improvement outcome biomarker-driven assignment investigate .</detailed_description>
