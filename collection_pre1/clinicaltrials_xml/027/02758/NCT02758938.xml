	<brief_summary>The goal study test usability update biofeedback game software develop help train muscle involve low urinary tract dysfunction ( LUTD ) electromyography ( EMG ) control video game . A Windows-DOS base biofeedback game system currently use investigator 's institution help treat LUTD pediatric patient . This system , however , outdated need replace updated hardware software . A new updated system recently create University Wisconsin-Madison ( UW ) Biomedical Engineering student . This system utilizes FDA approve EMG device ( SRS Medical Aware™ EMG Dual Muscle Monitor ) pair biofeedback game software develop student . The investigator wish test usability new software identify area need improvement make software user-friendly . This study evaluate end user ' ( i.e. , physician , biofeedback nurse , patient ) perception update software . In determine usability , hope 1 ) decrease risk end user error ; 2 ) make software intuitive ( easy use ) ; 3 ) decrease reliance user manual ; 4 ) decrease need training ; 5 ) increase understand software operation . This ongoing study continuously monitor usability software update base end-user feedback . The investigator plan usability test IRB protocol . If test involve item discuss , `` new change '' make IRB application .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Medical Biological : LUTD common problem child result wet day night , frequent urgent urination urinary tract infection . In subset child , LUTD result dis-coordination pelvic floor abdominal muscle . These child tend contract pelvic muscle rather relax void . This abnormal contraction result bladder change result incontinence . In case , understand contract relax pelvic floor abdominal muscle help reduce LUTD symptom . Identifying learn utilize pelvic floor without abdominal muscle activation one powerful effector bladder function . The current LUTD Program investigator 's institution include full history physical exam follow extensive education . If patient improve undergo additional evaluation renal pelvic ultrasound simultaneous uroflowmetry electromyography ( EMG ) study . Based evaluation percentage patient go receive biofeedback treatment . Biofeedback typically recommend patient use pelvic floor abdominal muscle appropriately void . The biofeedback treatment involve education , standard biofeedback , biofeedback computer game . In standard biofeedback , patient make aware abdominal pelvic floor muscle activity display show abdominal pelvic floor muscle ' EMG activity . In biofeedback computer game , patient control variety game pelvic floor abdominal muscle . Both method teach patient locate pelvic floor muscle isolate void . Biofeedback represent one possible treatment plan child LUTD . Patients analyze prior enter biofeedback portion LUTD Program compatibility treatment . Several study conduct McKenna colleague assess effectiveness biofeedback game treat LUTD symptoms.The trial involve 41 160 child vary age average 7.2 8.5 year respectively . The game work acquire feedback represent flexion pelvic floor relaxation abdominal muscle . All child trial participate approximately hour treatment per session involve around 20 minute supervise gaming time . The 84 % 87 % success rate trial show method use biofeedback pair video game viable option treatment LUTD child . Motivation : The investigator 's institution find success use biofeedback game train patient properly use pelvic floor abdominal muscle . Biofeedback less invasive traditional treatment method create potential harm patient . The DOS base biofeedback game system currently utilized institution unique involve interaction pelvic floor AND abdominal muscle control video game EMG signal . The system create specifically LUTD Program available market . The current biofeedback game system , however , update almost 20 year become outdated . It require controller longer available market , start reliably overheats easily . Updated software hardware essential order keep method treatment available child institution . Students UW Biomedical Engineering program create updated biofeedback system replace current system . The system utilizes EMG hardware already FDA approve pair updated software create student . The device still test phase , early consultation user population necessary assess need develop requirement . Users also critical analytical work test throughout product development . The investigator plan eventually market software field test feedback manufacturer highly desirable . SPECIFIC AIMS/STUDY OBJECTIVES Aims : 1 . Evaluate physician 's ability read EMG value record throughout patient interaction software . 2 . Evaluate nurse reception new software , include usability operation setup . 3 . Evaluate patient 's reception/satisfaction new video game part software package . Outcomes : Three metric use determine usability video game software : 1 ) medical value physician , 2 ) nurse ease use , 3 ) patient reception/satisfaction . Each metric measure use evaluation form specific role . The goal physicians patient rate usability 50 % high nurse rate usability 85 high ( System Usability Score ) . Because biofeedback use well understood EMG technology , much system 's success relate patient satisfaction . Therefore , first two aim seek show usability system setup data presentation final aim show usability accord patient engagement . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Study Population : A Focus Group session involve physician involve study , advisor project staff involve project well three random individual outside project ( 7 total ) . These individual provide feedback software use improve software . This study also involve patient currently treat UW LUTD Program supervision Dr. Patrick McKenna . The investigator aim recruit 30 patient complete Patient Feedback Form . Additionally , nurse ( 3 total ) involve biofeedback provide qualitative quantitative data addition complete Nurse Feedback Form physician ( 1 total ) involve biofeedback fill Physician Feedback Form . Focus Group ( Cognitive-Walk Through ) : To aid development final software use formal training set informal peer focus group session hold . These session consist Dr. Patrick McKenna , Christian Sauder , Joyce Jackson , Amit J. Nimunkar three random individual exterior project . During session participant ask freely navigate training suite game environment . During activity allow comment software respond follow question investigator . These question and/or comment record one investigator use guide development process . Nurse Training Session : After Focus Group session , nurse undergo training session qualitative quantitative data software collect . The nurse ask `` think aloud '' complete outline scenario . Evaluators encourage vocalize difficulty system recommend change interface design functionality . At end think aloud session , unstructured interview conduct user ask overall impression software suggestion improve . The think aloud session unstructured interview record transcribe member study team . Each nurse also ask complete System Usability Scale ( SUS ) . Biofeedback : Upon deliver appropriate consent/assent form , patient may begin biofeedback session new system . The patient undergo 3 weekly session last 1 hour . At session , patient EMG-surface electrode patch ( Kendall , 1050NPSM Neonatal Electrodes-Prewired , Small Cloth ) place 3 9 o'clock position perineum measure electrical activity pelvic floor muscle group . An additional surface electrode patch place rectus abdominus measure abdominal muscle activity . All interactive biofeedback test conducted American Family Children 's Hospital nurse experience standard biofeedback technique . End User Assessment Forms : After patient complete biofeedback session , he/she complete feedback form satisfaction game . The physician complete feedback form assess medical value device nurse complete feedback form assess ease use device .</detailed_description>
