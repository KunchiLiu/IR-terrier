	<brief_summary>Several report examine Programmed Death 1 ( PD-1 ) expression tumor-infiltrating T-cells , correlation prognosis discuss . However , Programmed Death 1 ( PD1 ) /Programmed Death Ligand 1 ( PDL1 ) expression peripheral blood T-cells cancer patient , particularly lung cancer , sufficiently study . The purpose study evaluate expression PD1 PDL1 subpopulation peripheral blood tumor cell patient lung cancer non-small cell ( NSCLC ) , associate clinicopathological feature patient study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation PD1 / PDL1 Expression Blood Cells &amp; Tumor Tissue , Their Role Prognostic Target NSCLC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective cohort study include patient NSCLC stage IIIA , IIIB IV lung cancer clinic National Cancer Institute ( INCAN ) Clinical sample . Prior inform consent receiving treatment , sample obtain 15 ml peripheral blood subject include study ( patient control ) . mononuclear peripheral blood cell ( PBMC ) different group subject separate centrifugation gradient ( Polymorphprep , Accurate Chemical ) use . The cell resuspend dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) 90 % concentration 1 million cell per ml keep liquid nitrogen use . Evaluation PD-1 , PD-L1 flow cytometry . The following monoclonal antibody direct cell surface antigens human use : anti-PD-1 , anti-PD-L1 , anti-PD-L2 , anti- cluster differentiation ( CD ) 3 , anti-CD4 , anti-CD8 , anti-CD14 , anti-CD16 , anti-CD56 , anti-CD19 , anti-CD20 . Immunolocalization PD-1 , PD-L1 lung tumor tissue patient NSCLC . Immunohistochemical staining ( IHC ) . Lung biopsy obtain paraffin block , process IHC technique antitumor expression PD1 / PDL1.V PD-L1 immunostaining classify two group accord intensity extent : ( ) negative , stain positive staining detect &lt; 5 % cell ; ( b ) positive , membranous stain present P5 % cell .</detailed_description>
