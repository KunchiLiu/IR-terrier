	<brief_summary>This study randomize control trial design analyse impact stress success rate simulate neonatal endotracheal intubation . To , pediatric resident enrol randomize either high-stress ( HS ) low-stress ( LS ) environment ask perform standard neonatal intubation procedure . Subjects cross-over second scenario within short window ( 1-2 week ) . Outcome measure include : endotracheal intubation success rate assessment procedure performance video-review use standardized checklist rat two independent reviewer . Stress level measure use salivary cortisol , heart rate standardize anxiety questionnaire .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although require skill pediatric residency program , success rate neonatal endotracheal intubation ( ETI ) among trainee know inadequate . Currently , teach use simulation ; teach method seem useful mainly limit short-term retention skill . In clinical setting , ETI often associate stress , could explain limited educational impact simulation training . The effect stress success procedure poorly study . Therefore , objective investigator study assess impact stress success simulate neonatal ETI . Hypotheses test : The primary hypothesis stressful condition negatively impact resident ' success endotracheal intubation neonatal manikin . Secondary hypothesis include : 1 ) stressful condition associate increased time successful intubation decrease performance intubation checklist ; 2 ) positive correlation heart rate/cortisol level resident 's response State Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaire ( STAI ) . Design : This study crossover randomize controlled trial set simulation laboratory . Subjects include pediatric resident pediatric subspecialty resident . Exclusion criterion include medical condition medication significant impact cortisol level . The resident randomize use seal envelope perform neonatal ETI low high stress environment , crossover separate day . Stress create standardize use audio alarm , third party supervisor simulate manikin instability . Level stress participant assess baseline lecture , upon arrival simulation center simulate procedure . This do use salivary cortisol , heart rate STAI questionnaire . ETI procedure videotape performance assess two external reviewer use validated checklist . Analysis : Primary secondary outcome include : success rate , checklist performance , time successful intubation , rate esophageal intubation stress level ( cortisol , heart rate questionnaire ) . Continuous variable analyze independent sample test categorical variable analyze Fisher 's exact test . Statistical significance define 2-sided alpha 0.05 power 80 % . To demonstrate decrease success rate ETI 80 % ( retrieve previous simulation study LS environment ) 60 % , 64 intubation need per group . Anticipated outcome &amp; potential problem : Demonstrating decrease success rate ETI HS environment aid improve simulation-based training neonatal ETI . In future , HS environment model use intermediate training process prepare resident stress related procedure clinical world .</detailed_description>
