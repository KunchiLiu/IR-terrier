	<brief_summary>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To assess impact C-reactive protein ( CRP ) Point-of-care ( POC ) test health care worker prescribe behaviour patient present primary healthcare centre acute fever recent history fever . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES To assess impact CRP test clinical outcome within 14 day follow-up . To assess correlation CRP result clinical outcome day 5 enrolment . To estimate impact CRP test antibiotic consumption first consultation . To explore attitude health centre staff towards POC CRP test . To identify prevalence key pathogen febrile patient setting . To validate ability CRP discriminate viral bacterial pathogen subset patient microbiologically confirm diagnosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact C-reactive Protein Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-centre , individually randomized-controlled , three-armed pragmatic trial compare CRP guide antibiotic prescription febrile patient current standard prescribe system . The study implement low middle-income country tropical setting , include Myanmar Thailand first instance . As participation study may raise awareness amongst health centre staff local community , current antibiotic prescribing rate assess observational run-in period intervention . Health worker ask complete case record form ( CRF ) patient present health centre current recent fever . This aim capture current antibiotic prescribing habit study launch . During intervention phase , patient fulfil inclusion criterion consent participate study randomise one three arm , follow : 1 . Control group : The health care provider manage patient use standard guideline . No CRP measure onsite 2 . Group A : CRP measure study nurse result communicate health care provider `` High-CRP '' `` Low-CRP '' use low CRP cut-off 20mg/L . 3 . Group B : CRP measure study nurse result communicate health care provider `` High-CRP '' `` Low-CRP '' use high CRP cut-off , 40mg/L . For two intervention arm , follow guidance give health care provider : CRP test report 'high ' , antibiotic treatment recommend , follow local guideline , report 'low ' antibiotic recommend . In either case information provide CRP test interpret alongside clinical judgement . A second CRP sample day 5 follow-up ( +/- 1 day ) patient , use capillary blood finger prick . The investigator use NycoCard Reader II ( Axis Shield , Norway equivalent ) measure CRP level . A venous blood sample nasopharyngeal swab take control group enrolment sent central laboratory order detect presence follow key pathogen real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) : - Flavivirus - Alphavirus - Influenza A &amp; B - Rickettsia include typhus group spot fever group - Leptospirosis - PCR 16 detection bacteria . - Malaria CRP also retrospectively measure blood sample validate ability distinguish viral bacterial infection . A urine sample collect detect presence antimicrobial day 0 day 5 . This procedure ascertain pre-study antibiotic intake , well patient 's compliance health care worker 's prescription advice antibiotic require , participation study . The urine sample collect site , divide aliquot frozen -80°c store site . Monthly shipment make laboratory Mahidol Oxford Tropical Research Medicine Unit Thailand analysis . The investigator aim follow-up every patient face face day 5 ( +/-1 day ) , either phone face-to-face interview 14 day ( +/-2 day ) initial visit .</detailed_description>
