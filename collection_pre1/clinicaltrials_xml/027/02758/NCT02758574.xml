	<detailed_description>Acute pulmonary embolism ( PE ) carry high morbidity third-leading cause cardiovascular mortality western world . It account 5-10 % in-hospital death United States translate 200,000 death per year.1 Recent registries cohort study suggest approximately 10 % patient acute PE die first 1 3 month diagnosis . Studies observe survivor &gt; 3 month report incidence chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH ) 1-5 % within 2-3 year PE.6-10 It incapacitate long-term complication thromboembolic disease negative impact patient 's quality life prognosis . The management acute PE mainly guide acuity severity clinical presentation . Initial systemic anticoagulation ( AC ) standard care treatment escalate base clinical presentation patient characteristic may stratify high mortality risk . The goal therapy primarily prevent mortality , secondarily potentially prevent late onset chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH ) improve quality life . Massive PE define PE associate sustained hemodynamic instability , whereas submassive PE ( sPE ) define PE without hemodynamic instability abnormal right ventricular ( RV ) function and/or evidence myocardial necrosis . It notable ongoing interest accurately risk stratify sPE identify patient increase risk decompensating and/or dying . Clinical score , image test biomarkers investigation , yet ideal prognostic tool still pending . A novel cardiac biomarker , heart-type fatty acid-binding protein ( h-FABP ) , emerge significant predictor mortality patient submassive PE . Systemic intravenous thrombolysis universally recommend guideline body massive pulmonary embolism , remain controversial submassive PE . In recent metaanalysis , subgroup analysis 8 submassive PE trial ( 1993-2014 , n=1775 ) show thrombolytic therapy associate mortality reduction ( 1.39 % vs 2.92 % ) increase major bleeding ( 7.74 % vs 2.25 % ) . These result mainly driven large randomize trial ( PEITHO , 1006 patient ) compare single , weight-adapted i.v . bolus tenecteplase standard anticoagulation . The recent development catheter-directed therapy catheter-directed thrombolysis ( CDT ) , ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis ( USAT ) , pharmacomechanical aspiration thrombectomy introduce tool treatment acute PE . Proponents technique suggest may provide similar therapeutic benefit systemic thrombolysis , decrease dose thrombolytic require potentially decrease risk adverse bleeding event . Both American Heart Association recently European Society Cardiology acknowledge CDT viable treatment alternative high risk acute sPE ( echocardiographic RV dysfunction elevate cardiac biomarkers ) , appropriate expertise available particularly bleed risk high . Catheter-directed thrombolysis require placement multi-sidehole infusion catheter within pulmonary arterial thrombus burden angiographic guidance . Thrombolytic medication slowly infused catheter , leave place duration treatment . USAT modification therapy utilize proprietary system local high frequency , low-power ultrasound dissociate fibrin matrix thrombus , allow deep penetration lytic medication . Several observational non-controlled series demonstrate efficacy catheter-directed technique improve clinical hemodynamic parameter reduce clot burden demonstrate favorable safety profile . The ULTIMA trial first randomize control trial include CDIs sPE compare standardize fixed-dose USAT ( 10mg rtPA per lung 15 hour ) AC AC alone . In USAT group , heparin group , mean RV/LV ratio significantly reduce 24 hour , become comparable two group 90 day . The RV systolic function significantly improve USAT group vs. heparin group 24 hour 90 day . In study group minor bleed complication rare major bleed complication . The SEATTLE II trial , single-arm study evaluate effectiveness USAT , show also RV/LV ratio improvement 48 hour . Limited data exists compare different catheter-directed therapy acute PE . The majority recent series catheter-directed intervention utilize USAT exclusively ; however limit comparative effectiveness data compare modality standard multi-sidehole catheter infusion . Preliminary , non-controlled data conflicting . One series Lin colleague 33 high-risk PE patient suggest benefit USAT angiographic clearance thrombus burden bleed event CDT group.31 Kuo colleague note difference outcome treatment specific USAT CDT recently publish early result multicenter prospective registry . Our retrospective analysis 63 patient suggest may difference two treatment modality , demonstrate similar rate outcomes survival , hemodynamic stabilization , echocardiographic parameter group similar procedure length lytic dose time-adjusted cohort . Selection bias underestimated study . The expected benefit USAT dependent device 's ability increase penetration lytic thrombus use high frequency , low power ultrasound , due reversible effect fibrin dissociation . This benefit show result faster thrombus clearance select vascular bed study , recently publish DUET study compare USAT CDT arterial occlusion . More rapid clearance pulmonary thrombus USAT compare standard CDT may prove clinically cost effective ( e.g . via reduced length ICU hospital stay ) . Alternatively , thrombus clearance similar , cost USAT may exceed cost CDT ( proprietary equipment disposable ) , without offer potential advantage . Evidence venous circulation , come recent BERNUTIFUL trial demonstrate difference time thrombus clearance low extremity deep venous thrombosis .</detailed_description>
