	<brief_summary>As people age HIV , synergistic effect normal age-related cognitive decline accentuate and/or accelerate decline cognitive functioning detect early one 's 40 . Although intervention need protect/improve cognitive functioning , one intervention already exist improve speed processing . NINR/NIA ( January 14 , 2014 ) announce Speed Processing Training use ACTIVE Study ( N = 2,802 community-dwelling old adult ) ability enable `` old people maintain cognitive ability age '' even 10 year train . As show ACTIVE Study , intervention uniquely improve driving , instrumental activity daily live ( IADL ) , health-related quality life , self-rated health , internal locus control , protect one depression ; represent area need intervention adult HIV well . In adult HIV , previous pilot study likewise indicate speed processing decline associate poor drive simulator performance self-reported at-fault automobile crash ; speed processing decline drive alone represent significant public health concern . These study also demonstrate Speed Processing Training improve cognitive ability translate improved performance time measure IADLs . Based prior research , RCT proposal consist pre-post two-year longitudinal experimental design whereby 264 adult HIV , 40+ year diagnose HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder , randomly assign one three training condition : 1 ) 10 hour laboratory-based Speed Processing Training , 2 ) 20 hour laboratory-based Speed Processing Training , 3 ) 10 hour standardize computer-contact control ( sham ) condition . AIM 1 : Determine whether 10 v 20 hour speed process training improve cognitive ability post-test , year 1 , year 2 baseline . AIM 2 : Determine whether 10 v 20 hour speed process train improve everyday function post-test , year 1 , year 2 baseline . Exploratory AIM : Determine whether improvement speed speed process and/or everyday functioning time mediate improvement quality life ( e.g. , depression , health relate quality life ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS This research directly meet goal NIH Cognitive Emotional Health Project Healthy Brain Initiative seek `` maintain improve cognitive performance adult , '' especially `` population experience great disparity risk cognitive health . '' Significance : Using Fascati criterion , 52 % - 59 % people HIV experience HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder ( HAND ) affect drive safety , medication adherence , instrumental activity daily live ( IADLs ) . Cognitive age group represent major concern since 2020 , 70 % adult HIV United States 50 old . Thus , grow population particularly vulnerable HAND due co-occurrence aging-related cognitive impairment . In prior study ( R03MH076642-01A2 ) conduct HAART era , compare cognitive functioning old young HIV-positive HIV-negative adult , old adult HIV perform bad . In HAART era , cognitive impairment continue observe several cognitive domain include memory , reasoning/executive functioning , one area particular importance - speed processing . Speed process rate cognitive function perform . People HIV vulnerable speed processing decline , especially age . Such speed process decline associate poor drive performance , at-fault crash normal old adult , well middle-aged ( 40+ ) old adult HIV , grow public health concern . In Southern U.S. , specifically Deep South study occur , point highly relevant : 1 ) even speed process decline , adult HIV must rely driving , especially rural area limit public transportation ; 2 ) epicenter HIV emerge last decade , mean many low SES adult and/or African Americans HIV also HAND . Regrettably , behavioral intervention try improve cognition pharmacologically-burdened population ; pharmacological cognitive intervention produce adverse side effect population already experience multiple comorbidities . Fortunately , type computerize cognitive intervention show improve cognition without adverse side-effects . Yet , two type computerize cognitive intervention conduct adult HIV , one Speed Processing Training . Specific Aim 1 : Determine whether 10 v 20 hour Speed Processing Training improve cognitive ability post-test , year 1 , year 2 baseline . Hypothesis 1- Adults HAND improve speed processing time engage hour train compare contact control ( sham ) condition . Specific Aim 2 : Determine whether 10 v 20 hour Speed Processing Training improve everyday function post-test , year 1 , year 2 baseline . Hypothesis 2- Adults HAND improve everyday functioning ( e.g. , IADLs , drive , medication adherence ) time engage hour train compare contact control ( sham ) condition . Exploratory Aim : Determine whether improvement speed process and/or everyday functioning time mediate improvement quality life ( e.g. , depression , locus control , health-related quality life ) . Innovation : We first develop Speed Processing Training use older adult HIV . This non-pharmacological intervention improve rate normal , community-dwelling older adult process information show improve performance driving , IADLs , health-related quality life several year train . In prior study , demonstrate 10 hour Speed Processing Training , inexpensive intervention significantly improve speed process IADLs adult HIV short-term . As part ACTIVE Study ( N = 2,802 ) , three type cognitive training 6 site across U.S. compare : speed processing , memory , reason . NINR/NIA ( January 14 , 2014 ) announce Speed Processing Training use ACTIVE Study enable `` old people maintain cognitive ability age , '' even 10 year train . The ACTIVE Study also examine reason memory training ; however , Speed Processing Training uniquely find also enhance tertiary outcome : ( 1 ) protect depression ( 2 ) improve self-rated health , internal locus control , health-related quality life . These tertiary/quality life outcomes essential area HIV likewise require intervention . This RCT 264 adult HAND extend ability demonstrate improve speed processing everyday functioning short-term , 2-year period .</detailed_description>

Men and/or woman Must 40+ year English speaking Have HIVAssociated Neurocognitive Disorder ( define use Frascati criterion ) . Because study longitudinal , participant live stable housing ( e.g. , halfway house ) exclude . Potential participant exclude indicate planning move outside Birmingham metropolitan area within next 2 year . Participants significant neuromedical comorbidities ( e.g. , schizophrenia , epilepsy , bipolar disorder , multiple sclerosis , Alzheimer 's disease relate dementia , mental retardation ) Legally blind deaf ( vision confirm baseline ) Currently undergo radiation chemotherapy A history brain trauma loss consciousness great 30 minute Those participate pilot study randomize Speed Processing Training exclude .</criteria>
