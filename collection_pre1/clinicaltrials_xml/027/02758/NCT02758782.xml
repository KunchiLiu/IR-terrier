	<brief_summary>To evaluate impact treatment non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) - Celecoxib - add anti-tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) therapy - Golimumab - compare anti-TNF therapy ( Golimumab ) alone progression structural damage spine two year patient ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect NSAIDs Added Anti-TNF Therapy Versus Anti-TNF Therapy Alone Progression Structural Damage Spine Ankylosing Spondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim propose trial evaluate efficacy combine treatment non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) add anti-tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) therapy compare anti-TNF therapy alone progression structural damage spine two year patient ankylose spondylitis ( AS ) . The trial consist two phase . In phase I ( run-in phase ) , patient active AS despite treatment NSAIDs elevate C-reactive protein include treated TNF blocker ( golimumab ) . Patients good clinical response golimumab week 12 eligible phase II ( core phase ) study randomize 1:1 1 ) golimumab + celecoxib ( experimental intervention ) 2 year ( week 12-108 ) 2 ) golimumab alone ( control intervention ) also 2 year . The primary outcome parameter absolute progression modify Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score ( mSASSS ) - currently standard structural spinal damage progression evaluation AS - two year therapy ( week 12-108 ) .</detailed_description>
