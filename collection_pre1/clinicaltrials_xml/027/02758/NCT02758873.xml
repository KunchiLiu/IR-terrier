	<brief_summary>One every 11 child United Kingdom ( UK ) asthma . Children asthma cough , wheeze difficulty breathing . The symptoms child experience mean miss school make difficult child take part playground game sport . Some admitted hospital . In fact , UK child admit hospital every 18 minute asthma . Effective medicine available , child 's response medicine currently unpredictable . This project focus asthma controller medicine call salmeterol . According report , ten thousand child may take medicine UK , evidence suggests might work around one seven . The study team investigate whether new approach treatment , prescribe personalise accord child 's genetic make-up , improve child 's quality life provide good control asthma . Treatment tailor way person 's genetic feature often call 'personalised medicine ' . At moment , doctor commonly prescribe salmeterol relieve asthma symptom child benefit enough medicine . But evidence suggests salmeterol may work properly child certain genetic makeup . The study team investigate whether help take child young people 's genetic makeup account decide whether give salmeterol alternative medicine call montelukast . A simple inexpensive saliva test provide information need guide decision making .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prescribing Asthma Controller Medication According Gene Status Improve Quality Life Young People With Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma common chronic illness child young people . It affect , example , average two child every UK classroom . Initial treatment usually consist salbutamol use demand step 1 British Thoracic Society ( BTS ) guideline . At step 2 , regular anti-inflammatory 'controller ' therapy start regular use inhale corticosteroid beclomethasone . Therapeutic efficacy inhaled steroid usually peak around 400 microgram per day beclomethasone ( equivalent ) . With inadequate asthma control step 2 , inhale long-acting β2 agonist ( LABA ) salmeterol , leukotriene receptor antagonist ( LTRA ) montelukast add ; represent BTS step 3 asthma management . The improvement asthma-related quality-of-life represent important goal overall pharmacological management asthma . Juniper develop validated questionnaire measurement asthma-related quality-of-life asthma control child adult . Furthermore , Juniper define minimum improvement asthma-related quality-of-life clinically relevant participant disease . In addition , Juniper recently validate on-line version asthma-related quality-of-life asthma control questionnaires child age 12 . This could provide opportunity long-term cost-effective comparison different asthma treatment use tools measure asthma control without need clinic visit completion paper-based form . Overall , child asthma manage step 3 , salmeterol appear provide good asthma control montelukast set randomize controlled trial . However , real life , efficacy salmeterol step 3 improve asthma control individual child appear rather variable , child continue experience day-to-day symptom exacerbation . The investigator show earlier study 1182 UK child young adult ( 4-22 year ) , 50 % regular salmeterol experience asthma exacerbation 6-month period , 18 % require inhaled salbutamol least daily symptom relief . A step-wise increase report risk asthma attack relate copy Arg16 allele β2 receptor gene ( 1.7-fold ) asthmatic child young adult expose regular salmeterol conjunction inhale corticosteroid . This lead investigator hypothesize , contrary observation overall population child young adult salmeterol superior efficacy montelukast step 3 , possess susceptible Arg16 β2 receptor genotype may experience good asthma control addition montelukast rather salmeterol second-line controller medication , addition inhale corticosteroid . As investigator elect identify database child two copy Arg16 polymorphism [ i.e . homozygous Arg genotype ( ∼15 % overall population ) would potentially greatest risk ] . The mechanism bad control regular salmeterol involve great susceptibility agonist-induced down-regulation uncouple airway β2 receptor associate sub-sensitivity response Arg16 genotype . The investigator therefore perform proof-of-concept randomized control trial determine whether genetically susceptible child homozygous Arg16 genotype experience superior long-term asthma control montelukast compare salmeterol use tailor second-line controller therapy add-on inhaled steroid fluticasone . The purpose preliminary study provide evidence support potential personalise medicine base individual genotype improve asthma-related quality-of-life control . This study publish 2013 , represent first prospective randomize control study child asthma address personalise medicine base genotype . The result study show child express homozygous Arg 16 genotype , comparison salmeterol , add montelukast inhale fluticasone significantly improve asthma-related quality-of-life clinical symptom , reduce school absence inhale reliever use . The relative benefit montelukast comparison salmeterol become evident within first 3 month persist throughout whole year . Subsequently , investigator systematically search randomise control trial compare effect salmeterol ( long-acting beta2 agonist ) montelukast ( leukotriene antagonist ) within context Arg/Gly variation , child asthma . No study could identify . In particular , trial either adult child study quality-of-life , key outcome interest context asthma-related disability , often unrelated outcome lung function . The absence randomise trial , together strength investigator proof-of-concept evidence , underscore need power study . Rationale : Children asthma inadequately control inhaled steroid 'controller ' medication experience great benefit asthma-related quality-of-life allocation drug therapy basis genetic status , comparison allocation basis current method doctor nurse choice inform BTS guideline . Primary Objective : Does prescribe asthma controller medication accord beta2 receptor gene status improve quality life determine validated questionnaire ( Juniper ) 12-18 year old asthma ? Secondary Objectives : Asthma control , determine validate questionnaire 3 , 6 , 9 12 month evaluation many visit participant report attend General Practitioner ( GP ) asthma nurse ( non- routine asthma review ) , A &amp; E hospitalise result asthma . Courses oral steroid medication take also record .</detailed_description>
