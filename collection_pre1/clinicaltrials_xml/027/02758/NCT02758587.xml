	<brief_title>Study FAK ( Defactinib ) PD-1 ( Pembrolizumab ) Inhibition Advanced Solid Malignancies ( FAK-PD1 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Programmed cell death receptor 1 ( PD-1 ) blockade well-tolerated novel cancer immunotherapy monotherapy response rate 20-50 % tumour type bladder , melanoma , renal non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , along durable benefit . However , tumour type ( pancreatic cancer ) poorly responsive likely activity PD-1 blockade limit many patient presence additional immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment interaction . The investigator recently show preclinical study Focal Adhesion Kinase ( FAK ) inhibition re-model multiple aspect tumour immune microenvironment , shift balance inhibitory Tregs , TAMs , CAFs &amp; MDSCs , one support active CD8+ T cell adaptive immune response , suitable synergistic anti-PD-1 therapy . The current clinical study explore whether FAK inhibition ( defactinib/VS-6063 ) safely tolerably combine PD-1 blockade ( pembrolizumab ) , early indication improve anticancer immunotherapy novel combination . The investigator focus three key tumour type , cancer clear need improved therapy . NSCLC , aim augment moderate monotherapy activity PD-1 blockade ; pancreatic cancer , aim release immunological activity otherwise resistant cancer ; , finally , mesothelioma , emerge data suggest agent may monotherapy activity , include potential additional mode action via synthetic lethality FAK inhibition ~50 % mesothelioma NF2 mutation . Phase I/IIa clinical study defactinib ( VS-6063 , FAK inhibitor ) combination pembrolizumab ( anti-PD-1 ) therapy , initially `` all-comers '' dose escalation phase , subsequently expansion cohort optimal dos patient : ( ) pancreatic cancer ; ( b ) NSCLC ; ( c ) mesothelioma . Safety , tolerability clinical activity explore , well extensive translational work characterise biological effect explore potential predictive pharmacodynamic biomarkers . PHASE I Dose-escalation `` all-comers '' phase I population , treatment-refractory advance solid malignancy , unselected tumour type follow : Cohorts 200 mg ( IV ) pembrolizumab every 3 week : plus 200 mg ( oral ) defactinib twice daily 200 mg ( IV ) pembrolizumab every 3 week : plus 400 mg ( oral ) defactinib twice daily PHASE II Expansions pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma , non-small cell lung cancer &amp; mesothelioma ( 15-16 evaluable patient ) . Pancreatic Pancreatic expansion response assessment ( single arm ) . Optional paired biopsy prior treatment 14 day treatment . Concurrent therapy pembrolizumab + defactinib ( VS-6063 ) start ( c.f . NSCLC &amp; mesothelioma expansion ) . 15 evaluable patient interim futility assessment clinical response tolerability data available 6 . - Classic `` stromal '' cancer , tumour microenvironment believe limit activity multiple agent . However broad preclinical data various approach re-modelling tumour microenvironment permit immunotherapy . - Minimal single-agent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 activity , explore hypothesis conversion sensitivity predictive biomarkers . NSCLC NSCLC paired-biopsy expansion tissue biomarkers . Mandatory biopsy prior treatment around 14 day treatment . 1:1 randomised split patient on-treatment biopsy concurrent therapy , defactinib ( VS-6063 ) monotherapy run-in . 16 evaluable patient interim futility assessment clinical response tolerability data available 11 . - Moderate single-agent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 activity explore hypothesis amplification sensitivity predictive biomarkers . - Paired-biopsy assessment proof mechanism biomarkers ( FAK signalling , tumour immune microenvironment ) . Mesothelioma Mesothelioma paired-biopsy expansion tissue biomarkers . Mandatory biopsy prior treatment around 14 day treatment . 1:1 randomised split patient on-treatment biopsy concurrent therapy , defactinib ( VS-6063 ) monotherapy run-in ) . 16 evaluable patient interim futility assessment clinical response tolerability data available 11 . - Emerging single-agent immune checkpoint , well potential FAK-inhibitor activity , explore hypothesis multi-modal combination activity ( microenvironment , checkpoint synthetic lethality ) , well predictive biomarkers . - Paired-biopsy assessment proof mechanism biomarkers ( FAK signalling , tumour immune microenvironment ) .</detailed_description>
