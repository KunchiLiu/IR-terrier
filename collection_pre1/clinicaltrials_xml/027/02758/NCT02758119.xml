	<detailed_description>Technology-enhanced simulation allow mastery learning . Mastery learn variety competency-based education demonstrate efficacy skill acquisition transfer actual setting . While traditional education defines fix learning time allow outcomes vary , mastery learning , trainee must achieve predefined level proficiency learn time vary . The main limitation mastery learn take time non-mastery learning . This concern main barrier simulation-based training lack faculty time . Thus , new solution emerge conciliate mastery learning time constraint physical simulator . Pre-training `` simulation game '' may mean reach objective . Simulation game serious game cross road ( 1 ) educational game `` application use characteristic video computer game create engage immersive learning experience '' , ( 2 ) simulation , imitation situation encounter real-life . They combine advantage educational game ( active , personalized learning ) simulation ( realistic safe environment experiential learning ) . By contrast , pre-training online course use PowerPoint presentation voiceover narration lecture passive abstract . The objective study evaluate time-efficiency pre-training use simulation game versus online course reach mastery learn management adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest .</detailed_description>
