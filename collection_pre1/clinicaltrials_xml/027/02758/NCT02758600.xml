	<brief_summary>Coronary arterial bypass graft surgery ( CABG ) proven safe improve survival great quality life patient coronary arterial disease . Evidences cardiovascular gas-exchanges response right early exercise-based rehabilitation patient limited . Objective : The investigator aim analyse breath-by-breath cardiopulmonary metabolic response six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) shuttle walk test ( SWT ) patient without left ventricular dysfunction ( LVD ) CABG . In addition , investigator investigate oxygen consumption cardiopulmonary response early exercise-based rehabilitation first day surgery . Methods : According leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , subject allocate two group : LVD ( LVEF &lt; 45 % ) without LVD ( LVEF &gt; 45 % ) . Patients submit 6MWT SWT link portable spirometric-telemetric device 6 day CABG . During first day surgery , patient evaluate pulmonary function respiratory strenght rest oxygen consumption portable cycle ergometer protocol . Clinical outcome time hospital discharge , pulmonary complication occurence arrythmias assess inpatient time hospital discharge . Incidence mortality , hospital readmission angina recurrence evaluate one-year follow .</brief_summary>
