	<brief_summary>The purpose study test feasibility scale-up sulphadoxine- pyrimethamine ( SP ) preventive treatment malaria pregnancy three Local Government Areas ( LGAs ) Sokoto State , Nigeria . The scale-up strategy test included introduction community-based distribution SP addition ongoing health facility distribution antenatal care ( ANC ) visit . In addition , study examine effect SP use participant pregnancy head circumference live newborn odds baby stillborn . Finally , investigator also seek quantify cost associated program scale SP deliver least three dos SP per participant via government operate distribution program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Objectives The study objective : 1 . Examine scale-up mechanism enable increase SP coverage community-based primary health care delivery , without reduce facility uptake SP . 2 . Examine community acceptance SP likelihood long-term community-sustained demand . 3 . Document association , , increase SP coverage improve intrauterine condition newborn , measure head circumference increment decline still birth rate . 4 . Estimate cost deliver SP scale per woman three dose high regimen . Study Location Relevant Contextual Information The study undertaken four LGAs : Dange Shuni Goronyo Silame ( combined 2015 population , accord official Sokoto State estimate = 661,606 ) LGAs purposively select intervention LGAs ; Yabo LGA , fourth ( 2015 population , accord official Sokoto State estimate = 167,971 ) , purposively select counterfactual LGA . The selection criterion LGAs high prevalence malaria pregnancy one LGA intervention group , select State 's three senatorial zone . Sampling Size Considerations Given intention study examine prospect scale already exist program , reach eligible pregnant participant , sample regimen include study . Data Collection Procedures The community-based health volunteer ( CBHV ) system inbuilt data collection system manage community drug keeper ( CDK ) supervise facility-based health worker monitor distribution community level . Investigators use outcome form collect data . Data capture outcome form include condition newborn mother birth , newborn birth—live birth stillbirth—at day 7 , 14 28 postpartum . For study , investigator modify outcome form also capture number SP dose participant receive date/month participant get . The modified outcome form also collect data pregnant participant 's primipara status , ANC status , gestation month time delivery , state newborn ( live stillborn ) , sex newborn head circumference measurement . Nominal cost expense data 2015 Nigerian Naira ( NGN ) directly relate community facility distribution SP intervention counterfactual LGAs obtain project record source . The cost estimate obtain would cost state government LGAs de facto provider primary health care Nigeria , deliver SP-related service community facility level , include start-up cost . Six cost center include analysis : health facility , LGA technical administration , CBHV supervisor , ward development committee , CBHV , logistics SP distribution . Data Quality Procedures Twelve team four data quality auditor , independent project staff , recruit track data quality obtain community . Each team comprise three female one supervisor . Over life project , team visit participant record least one birth—that occur project—in 42 ward three intervention one counterfactual LGAs . The data auditor also seek compile information omit mother birth . The auditor expect directly inquire participant—or inform family member - event maternal death—if CBHV CBHV Supervisor visit , status newborn , alive stillborn , head circumference measure within seven day among live birth . With participant ' response gold standard , birth , status birth , confirm head circumference measurement verify . Statistical Analyses Programmatic data use assess coverage SP dose pregnancy intervention counterfactual LGA 's . Univariate multivariate analysis use investigator test association dos SP newborn head circumference odds stillbirth . These analysis conduct Statistical Analysis System ( SAS ) v.9 excel . For cost data , investigator calculate two ratio : cost per dose cost per woman serve , disaggregated number SP dose intervention counterfactual group . Analyses conduct Excel® .</detailed_description>
