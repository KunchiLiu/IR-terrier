	<brief_summary>This phase 2 , crossover study Ataluren treatment nonsense mutation Dravet syndrome cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 ( CDKL5 ) deficiency , result drug-resistant epilepsy . Patients receive 12 week ataluren placebo treatment period . Treatment Period 1 follow 4-week Washout Period . Based ataluren PK pharmacodynamic data , 4-week washout period deem appropriate length time eliminate ataluren drug effect . Following Washout Period , patient crossover receive opposite treatment Treatment Period 2 follow : Patients receive ataluren Treatment Period 1 receive placebo Treatment Period 2 . Patients receive placebo Treatment Period 1 receive ataluren Treatment Period 2 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators try characterize safety profile ataluren patient CDKL5 Dravet syndrome result nonsense mutation evaluate change convulsive and/or drop seizure frequency Baseline follow ataluren treatment patient CDKL5 Dravet syndrome result nonsense mutation . Investigators measure change minor seizure type ( absence , myoclonic , complex partial/focal dyscognitive ) follow ataluren treatment patient CDKL5 Dravet syndrome result nonsense mutation change Baseline cognitive , motor , behavioral function well QOL follow ataluren treatment patient CDKL5 Dravet syndrome result nonsense mutation .</detailed_description>
