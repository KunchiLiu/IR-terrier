	<detailed_description>The Diverticular Inflammation Complication Assessment ( DICA ) endoscopic classification recently develop patient suffer diverticulosis diverticular disease . A recent multicentre , international , retrospective study find DICA classification significant predictive value outcome disease term acute diverticulitis occurrence/recurrence surgery occurrence . The aim present study confirm mention result propectively Several center , worldwide distribute , involve . A minimum 281 patient require study . This calculation base assumption continuity-corrected chi-square test type I error 0.05 type II error 0.20 expect detect difference 4.3 % prevalence diverticulitis patient diverticulosis 8.6 % DICA I patient . Only patient first endoscopic diagnosis diverticulosis/diverticular disease enrol . For patient , record : age ; severity DICA score ; severity symptom entry follow-up ; C-reactive protein ( CRP ) fecal calprotectin test time diagnosis follow-up ( CRP DICA 2 3 patient ) ; comorbidities ( ) ; concomitant therapy ( ) ; therapy take follow-up maintain remission ( ) ; month follow-up ; occurrence/recurrence acute diverticulitis ; need surgery . The study take three year . The investigator aim confirm DICA classification valid parameter predict risk acute diverticulitis occurrence/recurrence need surgery patient suffer diverticulosis/diverticular disease colon . This could permit select population high low risk , benefit schedule ( type ) treatment able reduce risk .</detailed_description>
