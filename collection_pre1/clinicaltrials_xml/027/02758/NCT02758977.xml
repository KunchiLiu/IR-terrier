	<brief_summary>Surgical resection offer best option prolong survival patient colorectal liver metastasis . Limiting factor major liver resection size future liver remnant ( FLR ) . In case normal liver function , 30 % total liver volume consider sufficient maintain adequate liver function resection . In attempt increase `` resectability '' criterion patient small FLR surgical interventional maneuver portal vein embolization portal vein ligation two-stage hepatectomies implement , need interval 4-8 week achieve sufficient hypertrophy . In order obtain adequate rapid parenchymal hypertrophy new surgical two-step technique , ALPPS , introduce oncological patient require extend hepatic resection limit functional reserve . Both procedure perform acceptable morbidity mortality . The investigator conclude time perform randomize study compare two surgical approach regard oncological outcome .</brief_summary>
