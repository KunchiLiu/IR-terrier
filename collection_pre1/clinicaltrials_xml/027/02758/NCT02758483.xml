	<brief_title>Glucose Variability Patients With Type 1 Diabetes With Sucrose-added Diet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : The continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) offer improved glycemic control patient type 1 diabetes , may reduce asymptomatic hypoglycemic postprandial hyperglycemia event ( 1 , 2 ) . Glycemic disorder may estimate whole determination glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) level , integrate hypoglycemic hyperglycemia episode ( 3 ) . Glycemic variability complex phenomenon include intraday interday variability ( 3 , 4 ) . The mean amplitude glycemic excursion ( MAGE ) index assess intraday glycemic variability . The calculation MAGE obtain measure arithmetic mean difference consecutive peak nadir provide difference great one standard deviation ( SD ) mean glucose value ( 5 ) . The continuous overall net glycemic action ( CONGA ) index indicator within-day glucose variability . After first n number hour observation , investigator may calculate difference current observation observation previous n hour . CONGA define SD record difference . The frequently use index CONGA1 , CONGA2 CONGA4 , coincide observation last 1 , 2 , 4 h , therefore , expression glucose variability within interval ( 6 ) . The mean daily difference ( MODD ) remain sole index estimate interday glycemic variability . This index calculate mean absolute difference glucose value time two consecutive day ( 3 , 7 ) . Some index complex impossible obtain self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) . Thus , CGMS allow calculation score ( 7 ) . Another aspect diabetes treatment nutritional counseling . According individual type 1 diabetes , diet adherence one difficult aspect treatment ( 8 , 9 ) . However , nutrition therapy essential management diabetes , meal-planning strategy type 1 diabetes emphasize relationship prandial insulin dose selection anticipate amount carbohydrate consume ( 10 , 11 ) . Carbohydrate count meal-planning method focus carbohydrate , American Diabetes Association recommend meal plan base carbohydrate count key strategy achieve glycemic control ( 11 ) . There two level carbohydrate counting . At basic level , individual must eat consistent amount carbohydrate meal . It useful understand effect food medication identify normal portion size , consider one serve equal 15g carbohydrate . The advanced level include pattern management understanding use insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio . Carbohydrate counting require ability determine amount carbohydrate food , may promote weight gain patient n't pay attention food choice ( 10 , 12 ) . Our previous study show patient type 1 diabetes begin carbohydrate counting , especially advanced method , increase calorie carbohydrate intake ( 13 ) . Sucrose attractive source carbohydrate , sweetness consider one powerful determinant food consumption ( 14 ) . Patients diabetes type 1 appear especially prone taste disorder ( 8 ) . Our previous study show patient type 1 diabetes 's habitual intake sweet twice week , despite hypoglycemia ( 13 ) . The use CSII associate advanced carbohydrate counting may increase calorie carbohydrate intake ( 15-18 ) . Previous study show use CSII CGMS improve glycemic control , However , study evaluate glucose variability patient type 1 diabetes diet food contain moderate quantity sucrose . The goal study evaluate compare influence sucrose-free diet sucrose-added diet glucose variability patient type 1 diabetes , treat CSII CGMS . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : STUDY DESIGN : This single-blind , two-way , crossover design patient type 1 diabetes recruit poster advertisement invite routine medical appointment Clementino Fraga Filho University Hospital , Brazil investigator . The sample size selection convenience . All participant sign informed consent . Selected volunteer instruct go hospital anthropometric measurement , insert glucose sensor iPro2™ Professional CGMS system ( Medtronic , Inc™ ) . In addition , volunteer receive instruction fill 7-day food diary , register self-capillary blood glucose ( four times/day ) . In day , volunteer receive control diet ( diet little quantity sugar ) test diet ( food contain moderate quantity sucrose composition ) two-days . These diet compose two menu : control diet Tuesday Wednesday , test diet Thursday Friday . If volunteer consume menu correctly Tuesday Friday , diet weekend free . However , meal consume improperly ( eg . less amount , inadequate replacement ) , Saturday Sunday use follow menu complete properly . The researcher contact daily order clarify possible doubt , verify adherence diet . After one-week , volunteer return download CGMS , order deliver 7-day food diary . INTERVENTION : Percent energy macronutrients similar diet , prescribe accord American Diabetes Association guideline ( 11 ) . Dietary energy content : 50.7 % 54.6 % carbohydrate ; 21.5 % 21.2 % protein ; 27.7 % 23.42 % total fat ; 5.0 % 4.9 % saturate fatty acid ; 15.1 % 12.8 % monounsaturated fatty acid ; 7.3 5.9 % polyunsaturated fatty acid ; control test diet , respectively . Both diet compose 41g total dietary fiber . Control diet little quantity sugar ( 30.4g/day , correspond 12.7 % total carbohydrates 6.3 % total dietary energy intake ) , test diet food contain moderate quantity sucrose composition ( 81.2g/day , correspond 30.2 % total carbohydrates 16.5 % total dietary energy intake ) . These diet compose two menu : control diet Tuesday Wednesday , test diet Thursday Friday . The diet weekend free , volunteer consume menu correctly Tuesday Friday . However , meal consume improperly ( eg . less amount , inadequate replacement ) , Saturday Sunday use follow menu complete properly . DIETARY ASSESSMENT : Dietary intake evaluate . All dietary record analyze use local nutritional software . During seven day , food drink consume documented allow quantitative estimation dietary intake . Data enter DietPró 5.5i nutrition software ( version 2010 , Brazil ) convert amount food eat individual nutrient mean daily energy nutrient intake patient calculate . ANTHROPOMETRIC ASSESSMENT : Body mass index ( BMI ) calculate body weight kilogram divide square height meter . Waist circumference determine average two measurement calculate near 0.1cm midway low rib margin ilial crest normal expiration . STATISTICAL : Statistical analysis perform SPSS software ( version 20.0 ; SPSS Inc , Chicago , IL , USA ) . A p-value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Qualitative variable describe frequency , whereas quantitative variable describe mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) 95 % CI . The Mann-Whitney test use between-group comparison Wilcoxon test use compare effect test group . Spearman correlation linear regression use evaluate interaction . Time course glycemic data analyze repeated measure analysis variance two-way ANOVA . The glycemic variability ( MAGE , CONGA MODD ) calculate accord describe Kovatchev et al ( 3 , 7 ) .</detailed_description>
