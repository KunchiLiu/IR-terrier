	<brief_title>Patient Navigation Lung Cancer Screening Urban Safety-Net System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Widespread implementation CT-based lung cancer screen underway , impact cancer morbidity mortality achieve IF people screen appropriate interval abnormal finding appropriately assess . The degree individual , especially medically underserved population high lung cancer risk , adhere complex , multi-step process CT-based lung cancer screen emerge key question immediate need solution . Specific aim study follow : - Aim 1 : Compare rate completion clinically recommended step lung cancer screen process patient refer CT-based lung cancer screen randomize navigation intervention versus patient receive usual care . - Aim 2 : Compare change patient-reported outcome , include satisfaction care , psychosocial distress , tobacco use patient navigation intervention versus receive usual care CT-based lung cancer screen process . - Aim 3 ( Exploratory ) : Explore whether difference see Aims 1 2 moderate theory-based patient attitude beliefs ( perceived susceptibility , severity lung cancer , perceive benefits/barriers screen , self-efficacy ) . This study offer unprecedented insight implementation lung cancer screen high-risk individual underserved setting . Findings show whether navigation intervention increase adherence screening process affect patient-reported outcome among underserved population . The propose program aim address issue lung cancer screen inception , rather disparities screen uptake already emerge .</detailed_description>
