	<brief_summary>Brief Summary : Until recently , Mount Sinai Hospital , epidural analgesia labor pain deliver pump could provide continuous infusion freeze medication combination push medication activate patient , technique call patient control epidural analgesia ( PCEA ) . In last decade , literature suggest continuous infusion medication effective previously think , suggest instead continuous infusion , intermittent program push use . The investigator device able . Programmed intermittent epidural bolus ( PIEB ) new technological advance base concept bolus freeze medication epidural space superior continuous epidural infusion ( CEI ) . The investigator currently use pump set PIEB , addition patient deliver ( PCEA ) . Studies show deliver analgesia manner prolong duration analgesia , reduce motor block , low incidence breakthrough pain , improve maternal satisfaction decrease local anesthetic consumption . The investigator recently conclude study MSH use PIEB observe excellent result . However , patient exhibit high necessary sensory block . The investigator believe technique optimize use dose freezing medication , use small volume local anesthetic high concentration . This optimization may also reduce amount medication use patient . The hypothesis study optimal interval time PIEB boluses 30 60 minute fix volume 5 ml bupivacaine 0.125 % fentanyl 2mcg/ml provide woman necessary drug requirement , thus avoid breakthrough pain need PCEA physician intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Studies involve programmed intermittent epidural bolus ( PIEB ) date provide analgesic regimen deliver amount local anesthetic patient 's requirement per hour , study do context association patient control epidural anesthesia ( PCEA ) rescue technique . As result , PCEA request frequent therefore study able truly understand pharmacology bolus technique PIEB regimen , PCEA utilize patient add extra component regimen . At Mount Sinai Hospital , PIEB device recently introduce . Currently standard epidural mixture bupivacaine 0.0625 % fentanyl 2mcg/ml . Based previous research do investigator , current epidural regimen consist 10 ml PIEB 40 minute interval , PCEA boluses 5 ml lock interval 10 minute , maximum 20 ml epidural mixture per hour . In study , investigator offer patient 5mL PIEBs bupivacaine 0.125 % fentanyl 2mcg/ml 4 different interval . PCEA bolus 5mL solution also available . The goal establish ideal PIEB regimen effective patient population use high concentration epidural mixture .</detailed_description>
