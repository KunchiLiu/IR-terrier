	<brief_summary>The use drug coat balloon ( DCB ) patient critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) tissue loss recently raise concern IN.PACT deep trial use paclitaxel coat balloon angioplasty tibial artery terminate . The investigator objective establish safety efficacy drug coat balloon ( DCB ) femoropopliteal occlusive disease patient critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) tissue loss .

	<brief_title>Evaluation Paclitaxel Patients With CLI Femoropopliteal Occlusive Disease Treated With DCB Angioplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although association drug coat balloon ( DCB ) therapy limb outcome could clearly link use antiproliferative agent , finding paclitaxel crystal downstream treat lesion , although small amount , raise concern safety therapy patient critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) tissue loss . These concern , however , may translate patient femoropopliteal occlusive disease amount paclitaxel reach foot may even small filter calf musculature . Since use DCB angioplasty Superficial Femoral Artery ( SFA ) popliteal show deliver significantly durable outcome compare standard angioplasty alone , report primary patency rate almost 90 % one year , therapy may even need patient tissue loss prolong patency essential wound healing .</detailed_description>
