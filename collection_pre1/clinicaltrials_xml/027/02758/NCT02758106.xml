	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Endotracheal intubation prolong immobilization patient receive mechanical ventilation may reduce expectoration function . High frequency chest wall oscillation ( HFCWO ) may ameliorate airway secretion movement ; however , vigorous oscillation may influence ventilator setting change instantaneous cardiopulmonary response . The aim study investigate issue . METHODS : Seventy-three patient age &gt; 20 year intubated mechanical ventilation pneumonic respiratory failure recruit randomly classify two group ( HFCWO group , n=36 ; control group receive conventional chest physical therapy ( CCPT ) , n=37 ) . HFCWO apply fix protocol , CCPT conduct use standard protocol . Both group receive sputum suction procedure . Changes ventilator settings subject ' response measure pre-set interval compare within group group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pneumonia may increase bronchial secretion decrease mucociliary function , thereby cause lung atelectasis . Patients acute pneumonic respiratory failure receive mechanical ventilation may therefore large amount pulmonary secretion , thereby worsen bronchial hygiene , oxyhemoglobin saturation ventilation-perfusion match . Cough function paramount expectoration ; however , cough practical patient endotracheal intubation sedation . High frequency chest wall oscillation ( HFCWO ) may dislodge airway secretion efficiently conventional chest physical therapy ( CCPT ) . However , pneumonia currently indication chest physical therapy . HFCWO compress relaxes chest wall generate oscillate volume lung , mimic `` mini-cough '' produce shear stress air-mucus interface change sputum rheology , thereby improve ventilation distribution , gas mixing , force expire volume one second . Most study report significant effect focus mortality , hospital stay , lung function BODE ( multidimensional 10-point scale body mass index , severity airflow obstruction , dyspnea rat modified Medical Research Council , exercise capacity evaluate Six-Minute Walk Distance ) score . However , outcome measurement associate immediate effect chest physical therapy may affect factor disease severity . Using amount sputum outcome measurement HFCWO strongly recommend . However , immediate cardiopulmonary change HFCWO study patient receive mechanical ventilation , although measurement explicit lung function BODE score , impractical patient . Changes ventilator setting cause HFCWO concern patient receive treatment simultaneously . The aim study investigate effect HFCWO pneumonic subject acute respiratory failure receive mechanical ventilation evaluate immediate cardiopulmonary change change initial ventilator setting . Methods The investigator conduct comparative prospective randomize control single-blinded study university hospital . Adult subject pneumonia complicate acute respiratory failure require endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilation consecutively recruit medical intensive care unit ( ICU ) ( 20-bed capacity ) . Pneumonia define presence new progressive pulmonary infiltrates two follow : body temperature &gt; 38.3C &lt; 36C ; white blood cell count &gt; 12,000/mL &lt; 4,000/mL ; purulent tracheal secretion without sign infection require antimicrobial treatment . Acute respiratory failure define sudden decrease PaO2 &lt; 60 mm Hg ( arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation &lt; 90 % ) without PaCO2 &gt; 45 mm Hg.17-19 All patient sufficient sputum production require physician order airway secretion clearance . Disease severity assess Acute Physiology Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE ) II score . Adverse event evaluate investigator report institutional review board . The exclusion criterion pregnancy , pneumothorax , manifest hemoptysis , unstable hemodynamics , increase intracranial pressure , undergo major cardiac , thoracic abdominal surgery . All eligible patient acute pneumonic respiratory failure receive endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilation , sign informed consent form . The patient randomly allocate study group ( HFCWO ) control group ( CCPT ) , efficacy bronchial hygiene HFCWO CCPT comparable4 . The primary investigator blind procedure patient receive . The local institutional review board Chung Shan Medical University Hospital approve study ( No . CS13004 ) . The experimental research conduct compliance Helsinki Declaration . To prevent vomit chest care , subject underwent procedure one hour two hour feed via nasogastric tube . Inhalation therapy perform aerosolized solution 6 mL half saline via ventilator HFCWO CCPT . HFCWO perform use VestTM Airway Clearance System Model 105 ( Hill-Rom , St. Paul , Minnesota ) connect vest via two flexible tube train nurse blind purpose study . All nurse well trained perform HFCWO CCPT study , procedure routinely perform nurse investigator institution . HFCWO apply subject frequency 10-12 Hz pulse pressure set 1-2 select scale range 1 10 ( arbitrary unit ) 15 minute . The patient receive HFCWO place semi-upright sit position , patient undergo CCPT receive cup-hand percussion hand position 3 inch chest , strike chest wave movement place right left decubitus position 5-10 minute each1 . Following HFCWO CCPT , suction perform immediately via endotracheal tube . Changes initial ventilator setting HFCWO record trained nurse check ventilator panel 5 , 10 15 minute HFCWO . The variable include peak airway pressure ( Ppeak ) , positive-end expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) , respiratory rate ( RR ) , fraction inspire oxygen ( FIO2 ) , inspiratory time , sensitivity setting . Changes patient ' cardiopulmonary response measure 5 , 10 15 minute oscillation , 15 minute sputum suction . The measurement protocol CCPT group HFCWO group , except measurement take 5 10 minute percussion possible single nurse perform percussion record measurement time . Rapid shallow breathing index ( RSBI ) calculate follow : RSBI = breathing frequency ( breaths/minute ) /tidal volume ( liter ) ( 1 ) Oxyhemoglobin saturation measure use pulse oximeter ( SPO2 ) . Data present mean Â± standard deviation ( SD ) median ( interquartile range ) . For outcome variable , comparison plan priori . A paired unpaired test use within-group between-group comparison . For non-normal data , Mann-Whitney test use . The chi-square test Fisher 's exact test use compare proportion categorical variable two group . A p value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . All statistical analysis perform use SAS software version 9.3 ( SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , NC ) Microcal Origin version 4.0 ( Northampton , MA , USA ) .</detailed_description>
