	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine relevant significance diabetes cervical disc degeneration , correlate diabetic control ( HgbA1C ) disc glycosylation profile patient undergo anterior cervical discectomy fusion cervical spondylosis . Additionally , compare level degenerative cervical disc glycosylation patient without diabetes . Hypothesis : Patients diabetes degenerative cervical disc disease high level disc tissue glycosylation , high level glycosylation correlate poor outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spine surgery increase substantially U.S. past decade , estimate 100,000 patient undergoing cervical procedure annually . As demographic age population begin increase utilization healthcare resource , surgeon undoubtedly face increase number high-risk patient . A number factor include smoking , obesity , diabetes significantly contribute surgical complication follow spinal arthrodesis . Nicotine direct inhibitory effect autologous cancellous bone graft revascularization , significantly increase rate bony non-union . Similarly , obesity demonstrate represent significant risk factor subsequent pseudoarthrosis link nearly 100 % high in-hospital complication rate . Spine instrumentation set diabetes link reduced incidence bony fusion , increase surgical site infection9 , high hospital cost . Achieving solid bony fusion follow cervical arthrodesis long consider important primary outcome measure highly correlate patient report outcome measure . Non-union pseudoarthrosis follow cervical instrumentation lead persistent neck pain and/or recurrence myeloradiculopathy . The incidence bony fusion affect patient systemic factor local biologic environment . Significant resource invest study local environment follow spinal arthrodesis , particular focus high-risk patient . Animal study suggest diabetes significant risk factor disc degeneration , yet correspond human study lack . Understanding mechanism diabetes contributes disc degeneration first requisite step design therapy prevent diabetes associate disc degeneration .</detailed_description>
