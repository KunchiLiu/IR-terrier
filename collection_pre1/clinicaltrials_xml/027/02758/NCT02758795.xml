	<brief_summary>The aim evaluate effect ingestion modify bovine milk protein circulate marker inflammation healthy men woman age 50-70y.The focus healthy ageing , i.e . delay deterioration health status old adult . Loss lean tissue mass , term sarcopenia consequence age per se , modify nutrition lifestyle behaviour . Advancing prospect 'successful age ' 6-month period protein-based nutritional support show preservation/accrual lean tissue . Chronic low-grade inflammation common age compound factor lead 'anabolic blunting ' , i.e . reduce sensitivity lean tissue enhance synthesis lean tissue mass response protein feeding . Using simulated human gastrointestinal digestion model recently show proteins anti-inflammatory bioactivity vitro . This study investigate whether anti-inflammatory response retain , post-digestion vivo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants recruit , age 50 70y Healthy Aging Study ( EHSREC10_45 ) attend 4 test day ( occasion ) Study Design : Single blind , randomise , repeat measure design 2 independent factor ( time x treatment ) Procedures : Occasion 1 Subjects undertake preliminary assessment per EHSREC 10_45 follow ; i. medical history examination qualify medical doctor ( ~45 min ) ; ii . provide blood urine sample evaluate ( follow analysis ) qualify medical doctor ; Occasion 2 Subjects undertake , per EHSREC 2013 01_12 , assessment body composition , dietary intake habitual physical activity follow ; iii . habitual food intake evaluate qualified dietitian ( ~45 min ) ; iv . body composition ( ~45 min ) v. habitual physical activity level ( PAL ) quantify use European Physical Activity Questionnaire ( EPAQ-2 ; ~ 15 min ) . Occasion 3/4 Subjects undertake two control feeding trial , trial separate approximately 7 day follow : Subjects report Metabolic Laboratory ( PG-052b ) , Physical Education Sports Sciences ( PESS ) Building follow overnight fast . ( ) A cannula insert peripheral arm vein qualify clinician phlebotomist ; ( ii ) 10ml blood sample withdrawn aliquot generate subsequent analysis ; ( iii ) Following 15 min rest period subject give randomise order either control ( CONTROL ) - placebo nutrient drink ( per kg body mass : 0.33g protein anti-inflammatory bioactivity ; energy ~ 160 kcal 500ml water ) nutrient ( NUTRIENT ) - nutrient drink ( per kg body mass : 0.33g protein confirm anti-inflammatory bioactivity ; energy ~ 160 kcal 500ml water ) consume within 10 minute period . CONTROL NUTRIENT reverse 2nd trial randomise order . ( iv ) Whilst remain sit rest ( read , undertake computer work etc . ) blood sample withdraw 0 , 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 75 , 90 , 120 180 minute post feed . Total blood draw = 100ml per trial . Data Analysis : ( ) Shapiro-Wilk test normality , ( ii ) repeat measure analysis either ANOVA ( R ) normal Friedman Test non-normally distribute .</detailed_description>
