	<brief_title>The Efficacy Acetium Lozenges Intervention Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Smoking dependence traditionally ascribed nicotine , major psychoactive component tobacco ( nicotine addiction ) . Dependence smoking , however , much complex issue nicotine addiction , past several decade , wide variety approach use intervention smoke cessation , variable success . Tobacco smoke contains several class carcinogen , include acetaldehyde high concentration . Acetaldehyde tobacco smoke easily dissolve saliva smoking , thus , toxic aldehyde could mediate carcinogenic effect tobacco smoke saliva . In 2009 , IARC proclaim acetaldehyde Group I carcinogen , equivalent asbestos , formaldehyde others . Based observation rodent , acetaldehyde induces reinforce effect act concert nicotine , Talhout et al ( 2007 ) hypothesize harmans ( condensation product acetaldehyde biogenic amine ) may responsible nicotine-reinforcing effect acetaldehyde . Harmans form cigarette smoke , blood harman level among smoker appear 2-10 time higher non-smokers . Harmans inhibit monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) , like MAO-inhibitors , might help maintain behavioral sensitization nicotine . This lead author speculate acetaldehyde may increase addictive potential tobacco product via formation harmans cigarette smoke . It know several decade L-cysteine ( nonessential amino acid ) able eliminate toxicity acetaldehyde react covalently acetaldehyde form stable 2-methylthiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid ( MTCA ) . This simple principle use recent innovation Biohit HealthCare 's Acetium™ capsule contain 100mg L-cysteine . Oral administration Acetium confirm effectively bind acetaldehyde originate ethanol metabolism stomach , raise idea L-cysteine could also use eliminate acetaldehyde dissolve saliva smoking . Indeed , Salaspuro et al . ( 2006 ) confirm orally administer L-cysteine ( 5mg ) -containing suck tablet ( lozenge ) totally inactivated acetaldehyde saliva smoking . Given , tempt speculate elimination acetaldehyde saliva cigarette smoke L-cysteine sucking tablet , might effectively block ( reduce ) formation harmans , reduce high blood level , thus alleviate acetaldehyde-enhanced nicotine addiction ( reduce MAO-inhibition ) among smoker . The present study design validate novel hypothesis regular use Acetium lozenges context smoke effective intervention cessation cigarette smoking . Objective : To test efficacy Acetium lozenges ( use simultaneously smoke ) trigger quit cigarette smoking compare similarly administer placebo preparation . Study design : A double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial compare Acetium lozenges placebo trigger cigarette smoke cessation one-year intervention . Methods : A cohort 1.800 current cigarette smoker enrol public invitation . Eligible subject must current cigarette smoker ( limitation pack year ) , well motivate refrain smoking , give write consent participate . The subject randomly allocate two group ( n=900 ) , receive either Acetium lozenges placebo , double-blind setting , examiner test subject blind test substance . All subject must consent use measure smoke cessation intervention . All subject request fill structure questionnaire recode detailed smoking history assess nicotine dependence FTND ( Fagerström Test Nicotine Dependence ) breath CO-monitoring . The subject administer smoke diary , filled daily basis , record daily number cigarette , test lozenge subjective sensation smoke . These diary return study monitor three-monthly FU visit , also subject new FTND CO-monitoring . The primary study endpoint include PPA ( point prevalence abstinent rate ) PA ( prolonged abstinence ) , use calculating OR ( 95 % CI ) two study arm logistic regression . Changes FTND score CO-levels represent intermediate surrogate endpoint PP PA . In addition , time quit ( TTQ ) duration quit ( QT=quit time ) use dependent variable univariate ( Kaplan-Meier ) multivariate ( Cox ) survival analysis . GEE Poisson model use estimate covariates ( Acetium/Placebo ) ) persistence abstinence , ii ) quit event ( events/person time risk ) , respectively , base multiple record ( panel data ) longitudinal setting . Finally , predictor multiple outcome intervention trial estimate use novel competing-risks regression model , ) effect , ii ) permanent quit , iii ) temporary quit relapse , iv ) smoking reduction , represent competing-risks event . The power study calculate specifically statistical technique , simply two-sample proportion test PP PA . This study ( n=900 arm ) adequately power ( Type II error 0.80 , type I error 0.05 ) detect true difference ( PP PA ) 5 % two arm , within range 10 % vs. 20 % quit rate two arm . Within ( 10-20 % ) range , study power sensitive decrease difference , allow less difference ( 7.5 % ) quit rate fall 5 % 15 % arm . Specific aim : The null hypothesis study implicate Acetium lozenges superior placebo intervention smoke quit 1-year intervention . Rejection null hypothesis base comparison two arm different statistical approach list . Impact study : This double-blind , placebo-controlled intervention trial test new hypothesis whether Acetium lozenges superior placebo trigger smoke quit regularly use context smoking prolonged period . If concept prof correct , result major clinical impact provide entirely novel approach support regular smoker withdraw unhealthy habit .</detailed_description>
