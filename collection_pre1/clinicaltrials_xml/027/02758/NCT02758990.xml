	<brief_summary>The purpose study study interaction gene , lifestyle environmental factor like food , nutritional supplement non-invasive medical device health factor measure without specialized medical equipment order develop lifestyle recommendation tailor individual genetics host common chronic health condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interventional Testing Gene-environment Interactions Via Verifomics Mobile Application</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study compose multiple intervention last 2 6 month evaluate suite prediction way give environmental factor impact specific health outcome base genetic information obtain direct-to-consumer genotyping provider ( AncestryDNA 23andMe ) . Substances interest include food , nutritional supplement non-invasive medical device . A minimum 500 subject enrol intervention , subject predict benefit intervention consider site interest assign intervention . The prediction base hundred thousand sit interest high minor allele frequency single nucleotide polymorphisms prediction response derive aggregate genotype locus consider . As site interest built-in negative control group compose individual enrol intervention despite genotype site predict benefit . The rate site interest make correct prediction subject response compare randomly-selected site order quantify placebo effect establish quality metric prediction . Enrollment participation conduct remotely . Participants upload genetic information direct-to-consumer provider mobile web browser application , informed consent inclusion/exclusion criterion accomplish remotely . After informed consent process , participant ask phenotype interest ( weight , migraine , insomnia , etc . ) interested studying , genetic information evaluate allow select intervention qualify base genetics would like participate . Participants answer series question establish baseline data relevant factor well evaluate inclusion exclusion criterion ; participant qualify intervention give specific instruction participate , may use software report data intervention . Each intervention utilize specific product rather general class product reduce noise differ sourcing , distribution , storage manufacturing practice .</detailed_description>
