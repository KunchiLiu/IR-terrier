Likewise , integrate mental health primary care one high priority Office Mental Health Services Office Mental Health Operations . The Uniform Mental Health Services Handbook mandate blend two predominant , evidence-based model integrate care ( Care Management model Co-Located model ) VAMCs , large CBOCs , large CBOCs . Because scientific evidence support implementation , `` Blended model '' mandate medium CBOCs small CBOCs serve rural Veterans . At small CBOCs , on-site mid-level provider and/or off-site tele-psychiatrists tele-psychologists deliver traditional referral-based specialty treatment ( Referral model ) rather integrated care . Objective : This project contribute Specific Aim 3 ( Test clinical intervention improve quality outcome mental health care CBOCs ) Little Rock CREATE application . The goal propose Hybrid Type 2 pragmatic effectiveness-implementation trial generate scientific evidence need justify national dissemination Blended model adapt use telemedicine technology accommodate clinical context small CBOCs lack on-site psychiatrist PhD psychologist . The result Telemedicine Blended model compare usual care ( Referral model ) pragmatic trial , intervention deliver via interactive video centrally locate clinical staff fidelity monitor control . Specific Aim 1 : Use expert panel comprise clinical provider manager apply telemedicine provide Blended model CBOCs lack on-site PhD psychologist psychiatrists document core component Telemedicine Blended model use PDSA process , implement model six CBOCs . Specific Aim 2 : Conduct Hybrid Type 2 pragmatic effectiveness-implementation trial adapt Telemedicine Blended model assess RE-AIM outcome include : provider Reach patient population , Effectiveness improve clinical outcome , Adoption providers Implementation Fidelity . Methods : In conjunction national , regional local partner , include provider manager experience Telemedicine Blended model , Blended model adapt small CBOCs use telemedicine technology pilot test generate standardized treatment protocol . We use stepped wedge design randomization sit sequential implementation step , CBOC patient screen positive depression alcohol disorder recruit consented participate Hybrid Type 2 pragmatic effectiveness-implementation trial . Data Reach Adoption obtain Corporate Data Warehouse . Data Implementation Fidelity obtain chart review . Data clinical Effectiveness obtain telephone survey . Impact : If Telemedicine Blended model improve clinical outcome compare usual care , result use justify facilitate implementation Telemedicine Blended model small CBOCs .</detailed_description>
