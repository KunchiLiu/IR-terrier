	<detailed_description>Macrosomia growth restriction important cause perinatal morbidity , near term . However , clear identification 'at risk ' foetus difficult clinical estimate fetal weight poor . Historically , ultrasound use second line case accuracy image modality mid- late third trimester also limit . Estimated fetal weight ( EFW ) important part clinical assessment use guide obstetric intervention , fetus small large date . When diagnosis intra-uterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) make , decision-making process complex , particularly early gestation involve multiple different factor , include maternal status , cardiotocography , liquor volume doppler . However , large body research available assist management early late-onset intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) paucity evidence guide clinical practice , macrosomia diagnose , therefore EFW frequently single important component guide intervention , induction labour Caesarean section . Fetal macrosomia associate high incidence perinatal morbidity , include shoulder dystocia brachial plexus injury fetus anal sphincter tear , uterine atony haemorrhage mother . A recent multicentre randomise control trial appear confirm advantage policy induction labour suspect macrosomia , demonstrate clear reduction rate shoulder dystocia composite perinatal morbidity . However , early low quality , observational study question benefit EFW make ultrasonography last trimester , suspect macrosomia , demonstrate practice increase risk caesarean instrumental delivery , without reduce perinatal morbidity . Despite conflict data lack evidence support routine third trimester ultrasound , absence specific guidance , couple concern regard perinatal outcome , mean obstetrician increasingly request ultrasound around 34-36 week gestation identify foetuses 90th 10th centile . This practice inevitably lead increase potentially harmful intervention base relatively inaccurate data . Due imprecision ultrasound-derived EFW , particularly case suspect macrosomia 3rd trimester , investigator believe estimate use make important obstetric decision regard mode timing delivery accurate method assessment could produce good outcome restrict intervention foetuses great risk . Some publication already demonstrate magnetic resonance ( MR ) image derived-EFW close delivery , accurate ultrasound , mean percentage error superior ultrasound recent meta-analyses confirm promising accuracy . The goal present study thus compare performance magentic resonance image derived-EFW , versus ultrasound derived-EFW 36 week gestation , regard prediction neonatal macrosomia .</detailed_description>
