	<detailed_description>The secondary objective study include compare IgG-dependent monocyte activation profile function laboratory thrombophilia parameter . Essentially : Is IgG-dependent cell activation associate presence anti-phospholipid antibody ( subtypes ? ) , profile indicate something beyond nosology anti-phospholipid syndrome ?</detailed_description>
