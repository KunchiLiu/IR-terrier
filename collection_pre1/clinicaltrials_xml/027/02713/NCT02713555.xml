	<detailed_description>Introduction This study comprise series study morbidly obese subject type 2 diabetes Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgery ( RYGB ) gastric sleeve procedure , investigate effect surgery incretin level hepatic insulin sensitivity . The method study ( study 2 ) seek validate well physiological method investigate insulin sensitivity morbidly obese patient . RYGB consider effective treatment obesity . The procedure improve glycemic control , patient type 2 diabetes may experience reduction antidiabetic medication within day surgery . The improvement glucose tolerance associate enhanced insulin action muscle adipose tissue . Recent report indicate hepatic insulin resistance also improve , contribution increase hepatic insulin action glucose tolerance controversial remain thoroughly investigate . Studies indicate RYGB reduces basal glucose production , 1 week follow surgery hepatic insulin resistance improve insulin clearance increase . In contrast , insulin sensitivity extra-hepatic tissue increase 3 month surgery . These observation imply liver play important role early improvement carbohydrate metabolism RYBG , increase insulin sensitivity extra-hepatic tissue ( muscle adipose tissue ) delay closely related weight loss . Effects hepatic insulin sensitivity glucose tolerance obese subject previous study address . However , dose response curve determine time-dependent change hepatic insulin action important understanding pathophysiology glucose intolerance obese subject RYGB , yet conduct . The development valid easy procedure estimate insulin sensitivity time effect incretin hormone study great value especially RYGB operate patient secretion hormone alter procedure . Understanding impact incretin hormone hepatic insulin resistance glucose intolerance may implications medical treatment obese patient , may potentially predict subset patient likely experience great benefit RYGB gastric sleeve surgery . Moreover , recent report indicate gastric sleeve procedure , stomach reduce size , elicit incretin response RYGB , although gastro-entero entero-entero anastomosis form . Also procedure report profound effect glucose intolerance . The mechanism behind yet clarify . Elucidation mechanisms provide knowledge body weight regulation pathophysiology type 2 diabetes , could help identify new drug target , improve study method surgical technique . The aim propose PhD experiment follow : Study 1 . 1 . To determine contribution hepatic insulin resistance glucose intolerance morbidly obese subject 2 . To examine extent increase hepatic insulin sensitivity contribute normalization glucose intolerance RYGB gastric sleeve procedure . 3 . Determine metabolic marker defect carbohydrate metabolism may help identify patient likely benefit RYGB gastric sleeve . Indices determine base modify minimal model analysis oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) data . Study 2 . 1 . To determine whether minimal model behind dynamic estimate OGTT develop simple addition two 2 tracer technique , compare data IVGTT two step euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp . Experimental design Study 1 : The first propose series experiment attempt determine RYGB gastric sleeve procedure improve hepatic insulin resistance affect glucose intolerance . The study protocol comprise 1 . An insulin-modified oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) standard oral glucose tolerance test double stable isotope tracer . 2 . An insulin-modified intravenous glucose tolerance test ( IVGTT ) radioactive tracer . 3 . A hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic glucose clamp radioactive tracer . The OGTT , IVGTT euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp perform , prior RYGB/gastric sleeve ( usual care ) 1 , 12 month follow surgery ( intervention ) . Liver biopsy perform surgery , ass liver steatosis effect obesity liver insulin resistance clearance . The effect time RYGB gastric sleeve surgery assess secondary marker liver function . Study 2 : The method study conduct order compare index two tracer OGTT euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp insulin-modified intravenous glucose tolerance test ass estimate insulin sensitivity insulin clearance . The subject also serve normal metabolic reference group study 1 . The study protocol comprise 1 . An insulin-modified oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) double stable isotope tracer . 2 . An insulin-modified intravenous glucose tolerance test ( IVGTT ) radioactive tracer . 3 . A hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic glucose clamp radioactive tracer . For study 1 2 Indirect calorimetry assess determine change non-oxidative glucose disposal . Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan performed ass change fat fat-free mass . Sample size calculation A sample size calculation perform determine number study subject require obtain statistical difference group . The calculation perform base mean standard deviation area baseline calculation glucose concentration obtain OGTT healthy subject i.e . 290Â±217 mmol/L x min . The calculation perform base follow assumption : 1 . A difference glucose tolerance healthy control obese study subject OGTT 90 % ( unpaired analysis ) improvement glucose tolerance 12 month surgery obese subject 50 % ( paired analysis ) 2 . Power analysis : 80 % 3 . Level significance : 5 % Based assumption sample size calculation require 9 healthy subject 9 obese subject undergo RYGB gastric sleeve need successfully complete full study program . To correct anticipate dropout rate study total 12 obese surgical group 12 healthy subject recruit study . Materials Calculations A biobank open V laboratory Aarhus University hospital appropriate freezer . The material analyze small batch order avoid inter assay difference . The liver biopsy examine histology day . After project come end leftover material ( blood tissue ) place biobank research , prove valid research subject accept . Urine sample analyze immediately preserve . The oral glucose C-peptide minimal model analysis OGTT data yield index insulin sensitivity , beta-cell function ( dynamic static component ) , glucose effectiveness hepatic insulin extraction . The disposition index i.e . product insulin sensitivity beta cell function calculate . Tracer determine rate glucose production uptake calculate use equation non-steady state . The volume distribution glucose assume 200 ml/kg pool correction factor 0.65 used calculation . Glucose specific activity calculate ratio tracer contraction prevail plasma glucose concentration . The Hot Ginf technique use maintain constant specific activity throughout study . Side effect risk The patient metabolic control subject expose radiation examination . The study subject expose radiation enhances risk non-curable cancer 25 % 25,005 % . Total amount blood draw 3-6 month prior surgery approximately 392 ml . Blood loss surgery amount 10-20 ml general . Should complications infection bleed arise follow surgery patient exclude study . In case minor perioperative bleeding patient treat observed accord surgical principle follow study day 1 month later postpone necessary . Between 1 3 month surgery 356 ml blood drawn . The patient examine 12 month surgery 383 ml blood drawn include blood sample endocrinology follow up-visit . All patient substitute iron B12 vitamin inclusion study prior study examine spot hemoglobin ( HB ) . Should HB &lt; 6,5 mmol/ l study postpone 3-5 week . The liver biopsy surgery lead minimal enhance risk bleed gall leak perioperative , enhance risk surgery general . After operation patient type 2 diabetes observe anesthesia postoperative ward ready ( blood pressure , heart rate pain control ) transfer surgical department first 24 hour also observe change vital parameter . Compensation provide accordance guideline local ethic committee . Statistical analysis When appropriate pair Student 's test use test statistical difference . A non-parametric two sample analysis use data fulfil criterion normal distribution . P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . ANOVA analysis aim detect difference metabolic response group perform appropriate . Multivariate analysis perform determine index likely associate favorable outcome . The analysis perform assess subset obese subject likely benefit surgical procedure Perspective The study plan shed new light liver impact diabetes , obesity significant effect RYGB gastric sleeve surgery blood sugar control .
