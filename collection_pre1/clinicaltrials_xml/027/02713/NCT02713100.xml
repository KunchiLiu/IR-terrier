	<detailed_description>In recent year , emphasis assess patient 's pain patient present emergency department . The Joint Commission mandate patient present pain must pain assessment perform address early care . Most emergency department use self-reported assessment pain use 1-10 scale pain . This self-reported level pain use determine appropriate treatment . The Joint Commission deal somatic pain address psychological pain . Psychological pain describe introspective experience negative emotion anger , despair , fear , grief , shame , guilt , hopelessness , loneliness loss . The assessment psychological pain use describe patient depression suicidal symptom . Some field emergency psychiatry believe patient agitate exhibit psychological pain , argue different somatic pain . However , principle somatic pain assessment treatment never apply assessment treatment psychological pain . Addressing patient 's level agitation could use reduce agitation thereby , reduce psychological pain . Psychiatric patient frequently present emergency department ( ED ) across country . Many patient agitate , necessitate treatment agitation ED . Agitation think one way patient express psychological pain . If one could assess treat patient 's agitation , one may able reduce psychological pain . Patients may exhibit various level agitation mild severe . Patients may progress one level next stay one level . Moderate severely agitate patient difficult evaluate usually need treatment agitation . Some patient may become violent injure , staff others . It essential identify patient might mild moderate stage order prevent progression severe agitation . This identification provide mechanism determine need immediate treatment ED . The treatment agitate patient frequently include physical restraint , chemical treatment seclusion . In review 13 publish study adults patient psychiatric setting , range 1.9 % 66 % patient need seclusion restraint . Another study find average 2 restraint 17 % patient acute medical unit . In psychiatric emergency room , percent patient restrain ( 20-25 % ) significantly high inpatient facility ( 7-20 % ) [ 8-11 ] . It find 25.2 % teaching hospital restrain least one patient per day . An average 3.7 % ED patient need restraint seclusion , restraint alone . Although frequently use emergency set , many tool use assessment agitation acute care set include Brief Agitation Tool , Positive Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component , Agitation Calmness Evaluation Scale , Richard Agitation Sedation Scale , Overt Agitation Severity Scale , Agitation Behavior Scale . Only one tool , Brief Agitation Tool , use obtain self-reported measure agitation . However , tool use student outpatient ; emergency setting . Also , tool use correlate agitation suicidal symptom . Tools measure patient 's psychological pain limit . These include Psychological Pain Assessment Scale Psychological Pain Assessment . These tool use study depression suicidal symptom . It evaluate ED patient present agitation . The purpose study apply principle assess somatic pain psychological pain use level agitation surrogate marker . This study compare self-rated agitation scale measure agitation ( Brief Agitation Tool , Positive Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component , Agitation Behavior Scale ) . An analysis data provide information concern accuracy self-administered scale assess agitation . The secondary purpose determine correlation measure psychological pain ( Psychological Pain Assessment ) level agitation . Study Significance The significance study determine patient communicate level psychological pain use level agitation surrogate marker . If self-assessment patient 's level agitation determine early care emergency setting , proactive active approach treatment occur . Proactive agitation treatment potential reduce patient 's agitation increase level comfort . This early intervention reduce progression agitation risk injury patient , family staff . Hypothesis The study null hypothesis self-rated agitation scale significant level correlation measure agitation . The secondary null hypothesis difference level agitation level psychological pain . Methods The study prospective enrollment use medical record &amp; convenience sample patient present ED psychiatric complaint determine level agitation psychological pain . This study perform community , inner city teach hospital ED 55,000 visit per year . The city 's police department designate hospital referral site psychiatric patient southwest side city . All patient evaluate emergency physician provide medical clearance . The behavioral health service begin psychiatric evaluation patient simultaneously medical clearance process . The behavioral health evaluation determine need psychiatric admission together emergency service . The emergency service responsible evaluation treatment patient ' agitation . A treatment protocol scale agitation use guide physician whether restrain medicate patient well type dosage medication . A convenience sample patient present psychiatric complaint emergency department research fellow Department Emergency Medicine available enrol study . Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Patients enrol study meet follow criterion : 1 . Presenting psychiatric complaint . 2 . Male female patient least 18 year age . 3 . Patients must emergency department patient study . 4 . Each patient , patient 's legal representative ( allow local law ) , must understand nature study must agree study enrollment . 5 . English speaking . 6 . Consenting Patients exclude study follow reason : 1 . Unstable patient 2 . Patients delirium dementia exclude complicate medical rather psychiatric etiology . 3 . Prisoners 4 . Pediatric patient The research fellow obtain consent patient surrogate ensure patient meet study inclusion exclusion criterion . The researcher provide brief overview study patient obtain verbal consent . Information collect data collection sheet include basic demographic information patient : age , gender , diagnosis , current medication , restraint usage , time restraint apply type , dose time medication administer . A research fellow complete data collection sheet input data enrol patient database . The statistician perform analysis data look statistical significance data pose question . Once data collect , identify information patient destroy ensure patient confidentiality . The research fellow responsible complete agitation checklist patient enrol study . The patient ' psychiatric diagnosis note psychiatric service . The patient evaluate level agitation arrival every 30 minute 2 hour . We use four test agitation : Brief Agitation Tool , Positive Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component , Agitation Behavior Scale , Psychological Pain Assessment Scale.The independent variable diagnosis , number restraint administer ( ) , time interval every 30 minute test , type medication administer ( ) , time non-agitated state level scale . The dependent variable would assess psychic pain use level agitation surrogate marker . The data inputted Statistical Program Social Science program analysis . Group differences case level agitation examine two-tailed t-tests analysis variance . Analysis variance derivative use determine , , difference exist patient 's agitation psychological pain scale assessment 30 minute interval two hour mark . Because relation predictor outcome variable presume linear function , measure association outcome interest predictor variable represent odds ratio instead multiplicative factor . Comparisons odds ratio predictor variable help determine factor great importance , confidence interval indicate statistical significance . This determine probability test accurately predict lowering level agitation time interval compare dependent variable . Additionally , predict correlation independent variable may influence outcome gender , age diagnosis .</detailed_description>
