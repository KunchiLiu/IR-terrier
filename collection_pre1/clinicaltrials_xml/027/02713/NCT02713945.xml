	<brief_title>Treatment With HMG-COA Reductase Inhibitor Growth Bone Abnormalities Children With Noonan Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Noonan syndrome ( NS ) relatively frequent autosomal dominant disorder characterise facial dysmorphic feature , heart defect , developmental delay , short stature . This syndrome mostly cause gain-of-function mutation PTPN11 gene , encode tyrosine phosphatase . The best-defined consequence NS-causing mutant enhancement Ras/MAPK activation responsible different NS feature . Mutations several gene encode component Ras/Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase ( MAPK ) pathway , result hyperactivation , also find syndromes close NS . Short stature cause growth hormone insensitivity skeletal abnormality major concern NS . To date effective specific therapy affect patient . Given role Ras/Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase ( MAPK ) activation NS pathophysiology , therapeutic strategy aim reduce activation seem promise . Recently , 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG-COA ) reductase inhibitor , also know `` statin '' suggest potential therapy decrease Ras activity . The efficacy statins treat cognitive deficit report mouse model NS . Statins ( simvastatin ) assess mouse model clinical study treatment cognitive deficit child discordant result good tolerance . Recently , demonstrate statin may also correct bone growth abnormality mouse model achondroplasia . As growth usually normal birth NS patient thereafter progressively worsen throughout childhood , investigator expect precocious modulation Ras/MAPK activation statin may attenuate growth retardation . To achieve goal , present study first prospective randomise placebo-controlled therapeutic trial use statin child NS . Marketing authorisation statin already accept treatment child familial hypercholesterolemia worldwide market authorisation statin .</detailed_description>
