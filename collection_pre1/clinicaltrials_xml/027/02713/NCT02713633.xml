	<brief_title>Indwelling Double-J Ureteral Stent Versus Externalized Modified-Salle Stent Pyeloplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pyeloplasty surgical procedure treat kidney obstruction due congenital acquire cause . Congenital like congenital stenosis Uretero-pelvic junction ( UPJ ) due cross blood vessel . Acquired cause like UPJ obstruction post stone disease renal trauma . For congenital acquire cause principle surgery remove UPJ stenosis ( diseased segment ureter ) reconnect ureter renal pelvis . This procedure know dismembered pyeloplasty . It describe 1940 Anderson since still gold standard procedure regardless approach ( open , laparoscopic robotic ) . One principles procedure 'Splint ' anastomosis , i.e put something across anastomosis heal process include internal external stent . Also surgeon even n't believe keep anything across anastomosis , leave nephrostomy tube cross anastomosis . In division CHP , believe keep stent across anastomosis help heal process decrease chance intra-abdominal urine leak increase chance success ( 90-99 % ) . So internal stent , use approach insert : 1- Retrograde cystoscopy take 10 minute start surgical procedure put stent fluoroscopy guidance common way use put internal stent . 2- ante grade , basically insert stent surgical procedure kidney ureter do without fluoroscopy . For external stent use one method , choose leave stent create small hole kidney pull stent hole create small hole abdominal fascia skin , do direct vision control . So sent outside patient connect directly kidney renal pelvis , distal part stent insert across anastomosis closing renal pelvis ( also vision ) toward ureter . The external stent connect end procedure urine bag . The type procedure affect choice type stent , stent insert use open , laparoscopic robotic approach . No difference choice antibiotic pain medication , perform exact surgery ( open , lap robotic pyeloplasty ) incision . All patient receive pre post-operative antibiotic different group . For alternative method , simply choose first patient example internal stent , second patient use external stent , third patient use internal stent , external , internal..etc . We choose patient accord age sex . Of course tell parent patient study choose enroll , use internal stent usually . Basically pyeloplasty surgery ( open , Lap robotic ) do inpatient . All patient spend night hospital Foley catheter next day full evaluation patient send home . All pyeloplasty surgery do general anesthesia . This prospective study compare post-operative pain , stent tolerance , stent care total cost common procedure pediatric urology pyeloplasty . The patient randomize 2 group . All female subject undergo standard urine pregnancy test rule pregnancy . The first group patient internal Double-J stent second group patient external Pippi-Salle nephron-ureteric stent . The parent patient inform day surgery type stent he/she end surgery . In post-operative period , patient stay overnight ( non-study patient ) next morning his/her Foley catheter remove . The patient his/her family receive instruction care external stent ( he/she one ) receive regular prescription pain medicine Oxybutynin ( patient internal stent ) . All patient give contact information call case concern question study , procedure stent . Patients randomize two different post-operative stent treatment use block randomization permute block . Block randomization help ensure end study reasonably similar number patient treatment group . Given investigator necessarily unmask study since place stent , randomly permute block ensure investigator identify pattern predict stent next patient receive . The website www.randomization.com use generate randomization schedule use block size 9 6 . This suggest estimate 45 patient recruit single site across 2 institution 90 patient recruit approximately 30 patient total per treatment group end study . The Principal Investigator Dr. Michael C. Ost , M.D , chief division Pediatric urology research pediatric urology fellow Dr. Pankaj Dangel , M.D clinical pediatric urology fellow Dr. Moira Dwyer , M.D . All patient ' name , detail procedure parents/patients questionnaire keep part medical record protect HIPPA regulation confidentiality .</detailed_description>
