	<brief_summary>The investigator want find good way predict risk fatty tissue inflammation use different approach find body fat composition . In study , investigator want estimate body fat composition use DEXA scan . DEXA stand dual energy X-ray absorptiometry . It standard establish test determine bone mineral density ( strong bone ) diagnose osteoporosis . This test also use determine body composition include percent body fat lean mass . The investigator compare participant DEXA scan result body fat composition inflammation find breast tissue mastectomy see relationship . If successful , may help u predict patient may risk breast cancer future . In addition , investigator compare participant DEXA scan result body fat composition inflammation find fat tissue mastectomy prostatectomy level exercise activity measure short questionnaire see relationship . The investigator also measure participant waist hip ratio . Finally , time participant blood draw standard presurgical testing , investigator also test blood prediabetes use blood test call hemoglocin A1c . The investigator also measure participant waist hip ratio , Hgb A1c blood drawn take time presurgical testing . If feasible , Hgb A1c drawn separate visit prior DEXA scan . If successful , may help u predict patient may risk breast cancer future .</brief_summary>
