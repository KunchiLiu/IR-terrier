	<brief_summary>This phase I/II partially randomize trial study side effect best dose ruxolitinib phosphate give together paclitaxel carboplatin see well work treat patient stage III-IV epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving ruxolitinib phosphate together paclitaxel carboplatin may better treatment epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether treatment ruxolitinib combination conventional neoadjuvant post-surgical chemotherapy safe tolerable primary therapy epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma . ( Phase I ) II . Demonstrate whether treatment ruxolitinib combination conventional neoadjuvant post-surgical chemotherapy result prolong progression-free survival compare chemotherapy alone , primary therapy epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine continuation ruxolitinib maintenance therapy participant complete 6 cycle standard chemotherapy combination ruxolitinib experience unacceptable toxicity disease progression safe tolerable . ( Phase I ) II . Determine impact ruxolitinib combination chemotherapy progression-free survival function propose exploratory biomarkers - ALDH+ CD133+ ( possibly also CD24+ CK19+ ) co-staining AQUA immunofluorescence ( IF ) ; ratio tumor expression CD8 : FOXP3 immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) ; tumor CD3 , CD4 , TAI-1 , HLA class I II , CD68 expression IHC archive tumor tissue serum C-reactive protein ( CRP ) IL-6 level pre-treatment serum . ( Phase II ) III . Investigate prognostic significance exploratory laboratory parameter term progression-free survival overall survival woman receive conventional chemotherapy alone . ( Phase II ) IV . Determine whether treatment ruxolitinib combination conventional chemotherapy associate total gross resection rate time interval cytoreductive surgery . ( Phase II ) V. Determine whether treatment ruxolitinib combination conventional chemotherapy associate complete pathologic response define interval cytoreductive surgery . ( Phase II ) VI . Demonstrate whether treatment ruxolitinib combination conventional chemotherapy result improvement overall survival primary management epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study ruxolitinib phosphate , follow phase II study . PHASE I ( COURSES 1-3 ) : Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 , paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 6 week completion course 3 , patient undergo tumor reductive surgery ( TRS ) . PHASE I ( COURSES 4-6 ) : Within 4 week TRS , patient receive ruxolitinib phosphate PO BID day 1-21 , paclitaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . If TRS perform due non-response medical contraindication criterion discontinuation protocol therapy meet , patient resume ruxolitinib phosphate , paclitaxel , carboplatin within 6 week complete course 3 therapy . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Within 3 week completion course 6 , patient receive ruxolitinib phosphate PO BID . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I ( COURSES 1-3 ) : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo TRS . ARM I ( COURSES 4-6 ) : Within 4 week surgery ( within 6 week completion course 3 patient undergo TRS ) , patient receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II ( COURSES 1-3 ) : Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate PO BID day 1-21 paclitaxel carboplatin arm I . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo TRS . ARM II ( COURSES 4-6 ) : Within 4 week surgery ( within 6 week completion course 3 patient undergo TRS ) , patient receive ruxolitinib phosphate PO BID day 1-21 paclitaxel carboplatin arm I . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient phase I follow resolution adverse event , patient phase II follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
