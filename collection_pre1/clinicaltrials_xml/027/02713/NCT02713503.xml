	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate variety technology drive simulator . Specifically , research provide direct comparison driver performance measure various mode mobile device interaction . The study conduct CU-ICAR use DriveSafety CDS-250 drive simulator . The experiment key step understand driver performance challenge error may occur various interaction mode drive context . Results investigate difference drive performance presence absence full device pair vehicle electronics criterion might consider propose pairing requirement . The drive simulator task focus visual scanning ability engage secondary task use mobile device ( limit ) handheld phone without Bluetooth , mount touchscreen display , various voice-based interface , novel display system . Tasks include activity make voice call , text messaging , search point interest map , traditional in-vehicle activity change temperature , fan speed , radio station , etc . The number task interaction mode vary participant 6 mode include per participant ( e.g . handheld , mount ipad , voice control ) . The technology integrate DriveSafety CDS-250 drive simulator . Participants complete Functional Object Detection ( FOD ) visual scan task require driver maintain lane position , respond brake event central field view , respond target event appear periphery . In addition , participant ask concurrently complete mobile-device task use interaction mode describe previously occasionally respond notification simulate connected-vehicle interaction . Primary outcome include drive performance ( lane track speed maintenance ) , FOD peripheral task performance ( % identify , response time ) , FOD brake task performance ( % identify , response time , false positive response ) , subjective measure include workload , interface preference , open end item describe reaction interface . Participants complete train get comfortable drive simulator drive straight road repeat task use cruise control prior drive experimental condition . Participants recruit word mouth well use flyer , newspaper advertisement , talk community . All data collect drive simulator lab CU-ICAR . We plan share finding research designer , practitioner researcher conference academic publication . Participants complete vision screen use standard eye chart complete visual scanning task use interactive light board participant stand ( sit ) front board move light ask identify location , color , letter number light press location board . DriveSafetyâ„¢ CDS-250 Driving Simulator The CDS-250 driving simulator design rehabilitation tool occupies small footprint traditional driving simulator . The simulator partial cab consist adjustable driver 's seat , center console , instrument cluster , standard vehicle control ( steer wheel , accelerator , brake ) . Two input button locate steer wheel `` 3:00 '' `` 9:00 '' position . The display consist three 19 '' ( diagonal ) LCD screen resolution 1440 X 900 pixel . The left right screen rotate 30 degree off-plane center screen toward driver . The total horizontal width display configuration 49 '' . In addition use drive simulator driving related task , variety reaction time task develop work patient ' coordinate muscle movement , information processing , reaction time .</detailed_description>
