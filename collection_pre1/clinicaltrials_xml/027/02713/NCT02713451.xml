	<brief_summary>No clear recommendation exist level oxygenation intensive care patient . In Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) , pulse oxymetry ( SpO2 ) keep 88 95 percent oxygen alveolar pressure 55 80 mmHg ( PaO2 ) . These recommendation common lie high scientific knowledge level proof . In major study fifteen last year change ARDS management , PaO2 keep around 85 90 mmHg despite current recommendation 55 80 mmHg PaO2 . Many recent review cohort study point risk excessive oxygenation especially follow cardiac arrest , stroke traumatic brain injury . However , data come majority cohort database study without strong definition hyperoxia . Data come prospective study scarce tend show well outcome patient low objective oxygenation ICU . High oxygen ( O2 ) level may deleterious especially inflammatory lung . It could enhance injury due mechanical ventilation . O2 could responsable `` hyperoxia induced lung injury `` . The investigator show precedent study compare restrictive oxygenation versus liberal oxygenation feasable expose patient major adverse event . More , mortality 60 day tendency lower . The investigator therefore ask low objective PaO2 comparison level usually see last study ARDS could improve ARDS patient outcome . The aim study show restrictive oxygenation comparison liberal oxygenation strategy patient ARDS would lower mortality 28 day .</brief_summary>
