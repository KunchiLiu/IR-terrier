	<brief_summary>This study aim investigate potential link Obstructive Sleep Apnoea ( OSA ) Open Angle Glaucoma ( OAG ) ; initially determine whether prevalence OSA high patient OAG comparison people without glaucoma OSA independent risk factor OAG . It comprehensively phenotype glaucoma patient variable may associate OSA OAG .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open Angle Glaucoma ( OAG ) eye disease lead irreversible loss vision cause damage optic nerve back eye . It often associate raise fluid pressure eye treat lowering pressure . However , despite treatment , patient continue lose vision suspect factor contribute optic nerve damage . Among Obstructive Sleep Apnoea ( OSA ) , though link OAG OSA controversial . This study aim determine whether prevalence OSA high patient OAG comparison people without glaucoma . In addition , establish whether OSA independent risk factor OAG whether future randomise control trial assess impact OSA treatment Continues Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) OAG outcomes would acceptable feasible population . The usefulness OSA screening tool , include oximetry questionnaire also determine . We comprehensively phenotype glaucoma patient use novel technique , include angiographic ocular coherence tomography retinal oximetry . Ocular perfusion pressure calculate base central retinal vein pressure measure ophthalmodynamometry . The study collaborative project sleep specialist Papworth Hospital ophthalmologist Hinchingbrooke Hospital involve patient attend glaucoma clinic relative act control group . Two study visit require consecutive day . Participants undergo comprehensive ocular examination sleep study form respiratory polysomnography ( respiratory PSG ) home . A brief medical history focus cardiovascular metabolic co-morbidities take .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Glaucoma patient : 1 . Open angle glaucoma ( include primary open angle glaucoma , normal tension glaucoma pseudoexfoliation glaucoma ) either eye . 2 . Age ≥18 year 3 . Able give inform consent attend require frequency duration study . Control group : 1 . Age ≥18 year 2 . Able give inform consent attend require frequency duration study . Glaucoma patient : 1 . Unable perform reliable visual field test ( &gt; 15 % false positive , &gt; 20 % fixation loss . However , fixation loss &gt; 20 % , eye tracker may use assess reliability ) 2 . Known suspected pregnancy . 3 . Tracheostomy 4 . Use nocturnal oxygen indication sleep relate breathing disorder ( SBD ) . Control group : 1 . Known suspected pregnancy 2 . Known suspected glaucoma ( participant glaucoma diagnose screen ophthalmic examination newly identify glaucoma 'suspects ' also exclude ) 3 . Inability undergo screen ophthalmic examination 4 . Tracheostomy 5 . Use nocturnal oxygen indication sleep relate breathing disorder ( SBD ) .</criteria>
