	<brief_title>Efficacy , Safety , Pharmacokinetics Femoral Nerve Block With EXPAREL Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On Day 0 , eligible subject randomize 1:1:1 ratio receive single dose either EXPAREL 133 mg 10 mL expand volume 10 mL normal saline total volume 20 mL ( Group 1 ) ; EXPAREL 266 mg 20 mL ( Group 2 ) ; placebo 20 mL ( Group 3 ) . Study drug ( EXPAREL placebo ) administer blinded manner via ultrasound guide single-dose femoral nerve block least 1 hour prior surgery . Prior placement prosthesis , 8 mL bupivacaine hydrochloride ( HCl ) ( 0.5 % ) dilute 8 mL normal saline administer surgeon periarticular infiltration posterior capsule ( 8 mL medially 8 mL laterally ) . Postsurgical assessment include pain intensity score use 10-cm visual analog scale ( VAS ) ; total postsurgical opioid consumption ; overall benefit analgesia score ( OBAS ) questionnaire ; subject satisfaction overall analgesia use 5-point Likert scale ; neurological assessment ; sensory function assessment ; motor function assessment ; study physical therapy assessment ( ie , time walk , time go , stair climb test ) ; discharge readiness ; unscheduled phone call office visit relate pain ; 12-lead ECGs ; vital sign measurement ; clinical laboratory test . Adverse event record time informed consent form ( ICF ) sign postsurgical Day 29 . Follow-up visit schedule subject postsurgical Days 6 10 . A follow-up phone call make postsurgical Day 29 . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter estimate plasma bupivacaine measurement use non-compartmental analysis base sample schedule baseline ( prior nerve block ) postsurgical Day 10 .</detailed_description>
