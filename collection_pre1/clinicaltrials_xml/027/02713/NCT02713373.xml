	<brief_title>Cetuximab Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With Colorectal Cancer That Metastatic Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate objective response rate patient metastatic colorectal cancer treat pembrolizumab cetuximab . II . To estimate 6-month progression free survival ( PFS ) rate patient metastatic colorectal cancer treat pembrolizumab cetuximab . III . To examine adverse event profile combine pembrolizumab cetuximab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine PFS patient metastatic colorectal cancer treat pembrolizumab cetuximab . II . To determine objective response rate immune-related response criterion ( irRC ) patient metastatic colorectal cancer . III . To examine overall survival patient metastatic colorectal cancer treat pembrolizumab cetuximab . EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES : I . Identify tumor peripheral blood biomarkers response and/or resistance study treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive cetuximab intravenously ( IV ) 120 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 ( monotherapy cycle 1 ) pembrolizumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may continue pembrolizumab treatment 1 year experience disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
