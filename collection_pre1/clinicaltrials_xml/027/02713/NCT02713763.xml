	<brief_summary>The therapeutic goal management pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( pNET ) control symptoms tumor growth control order improve patient survival . In recent year , data two phase III study target therapy , sunitinib everolimus , broaden possibility treatment patient neuroendocrine tumor pancreas . Unfortunately , patient progress development new active drug evaluate best treatment approach decisive . Given lack data compare activity different treatment strategy , final decision base medical experience consensus expert . In context , different question still unanswered , best sequence treatment patient benefit available drug . Neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor highly vascularized tumor cell may dependent pathway growth throughout entire history tumor inhibition pathway crucial . On hand , aspect endorse population patient pNET previously fail treatment sunitinib . In scenario ass retreatment sunitinib evaluate activity drug context therapeutic rescue patient metastatic pNET .</brief_summary>
