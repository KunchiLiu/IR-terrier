	<brief_title>Efficacy , Safety , Pharmacokinetics Brachial Plexus Block With EXPAREL Shoulder Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On Day 0 , eligible subject randomize 1:1 ratio receive single dose EXPAREL 133 mg 10 mL expand volume 10 mL normal saline total volume 20 mL placebo 20 mL . Study drug ( EXPAREL placebo ) administer blinded manner via ultrasound guide single-dose brachial plexus block least 1 hour prior surgery . Postsurgical assessment include pain intensity score use 10-cm visual analog scale ( VAS ) ; total postsurgical opioid consumption ; overall benefit analgesia score ( OBAS ) questionnaire ; subject satisfaction overall analgesia use 5 point Likert scale ; neurological assessment ; sensory function assessment ; motor function assessment ; discharge readiness ; unscheduled phone call office visit relate pain ; 12-lead ECGs ; vital sign measurement ; clinical laboratory test . Adverse event record time informed consent form sign postsurgical Day 29 . Follow-up visit schedule subject postsurgical Days 5 10 . A follow-up phone call make postsurgical Day 29 . A population Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) analysis utilized limit number blood draw sample schedule baseline ( prior nerve block ) hospital discharge . There two collection sequence study subject randomize one sequence .</detailed_description>
