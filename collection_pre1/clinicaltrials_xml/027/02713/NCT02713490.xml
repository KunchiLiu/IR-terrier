	<brief_title>Local Infiltration Analgesia With Without EXPAREL Following Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>On Day 0 , eligible subject randomize 1:1 two treatment group . Subjects Group 1 receive local infiltration analgesia ( LIA ) EXPAREL 266 mg 20 mL admixed bupivacaine hydrochloride ( HCl ) 0.5 % 20 mL expand volume 80 mL normal saline ( total volume 120 mL ) . Subjects Group 2 receive LIA bupivacaine HCl 0.5 % 20 mL expand volume 100 mL normal saline ( total volume 120 mL ) . Investigators use usual surgical technique perform TKA . Study drug administer use six 20 cc syrinx 22-gauge needle prior wound closure . Each stick deliver approximately 1-1.5 cc intend area . The tissue visibly expand minimal leakage . Study drug inject prescribed location base area high nerve density . Infiltration Technique Prior cementation Syringe # 1 : Posterior capsule ( 8-10 stick medial 8-10 stick lateral ) . Syringe # 2 : Femur medial lateral periosteum , posterior periosteum , suprapatellar/quadriceps tendon ( 20 stick ) . Syringe # 3 : Tibia fat pad ( 5 stick ) ; pe anserinus , medial collateral ligament , gutter ( 15 stick ) . Syringe # 4 : Circumferential periosteum ( 15-20 stick ) . After cementation Syringe # 5 : Midline quadriceps tendon ( 10 stick ) ; retinaculum , medial gutter , femoral tibia ( 10 stick ) . Syringe # 6 : Lateral gutter , femoral tibial ( 10 stick ) ; subcutaneous/closure ( 10 stick ) . In addition LIA , study participant receive standardize approach manage postsurgical pain include schedule multimodal pain regimen include adjunctive analgesic , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , rescue analgesic need . Postsurgical clinical assessment include pain intensity score use 10-cm visual analog scale ( VAS ) ; overall benefit analgesia score ( OBAS ) questionnaire ; total postsurgical opioid consumption ; physical therapy assessment ; nurse 's satisfaction overall analgesia ; discharge readiness . Adverse event ( AEs ) record time informed consent form sign postsurgical Day 29 . Postsurgical health economic outcome assessment include hospital length stay ( LOS ) , use skilled nursing facility , outpatient physical therapy use , hospital readmission , use health service follow discharge ( phone call related postsurgical pain , unscheduled visit relate postsurgical pain , visit emergency department ) postsurgical Day 29 . A follow-up visit schedule subject postsurgical Day 14 . A follow-up phone call make postsurgical Day 29 subject receive study drug ass AEs .</detailed_description>
