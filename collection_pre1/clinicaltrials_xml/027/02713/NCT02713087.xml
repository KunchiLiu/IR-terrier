	<brief_summary>Project title : Influence Vasopressors Brain Oxygenation Microcirculation Anesthetized Patients Cerebral Tumors Sponsor-investigator : Klaus Ulrik Koch M.D . Sponsor : Department Anesthesia Aarhus University Hospital , Nørrebrogade 44 , 8000 Aarhus C , Denmark Objective : To investigate whether phenylephrine ephedrine cause different alteration microcirculation oxygenation , measure MRI PET , anesthetize patient brain tumor . Using MRI PET , study assess whether difference deoxyhemoglobin concentration ( Bold signal ) , CTTH , cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) cerebral metabolic rate oxygen ( CMRO2 ) ephedrine phenylephrine Method : Double blind control randomized clinical trial . Either phenylephrine ephedrine infuse intravenously general anesthesia . MRI perform 20 patient infusion . PET/CT perform 20 patient infusion . BIS NIRS monitoring use either scanner . After scan patient transport operate theatre craniotomy perform . After removal bone flap subdural ICP measure record . MRI analyze CBF , CTH , max.CMRO2 , maxOEF , CBV grey-scale ADC ephedrine phenylephrine . PET/CT analyze CBF CMRO2 ephedrine phenylephrine calculation OEF . During PET/CT scan session oxygen saturation hemoglobin concentration measure . Data propose study add substantial new knowledge investigator current understanding effect vasopressor cerebral circulation . This information aid neuroanesthesiologist , neurointensivist neurosurgeon choice optimal method manage cerebral perfusion pressure craniotomy brain tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : During brain tumor surgery main objective neuroanesthesiologist maintain low intracranial pressure ( ICP ) sufficient cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) ( CPP = mean arterial blood pressure [ MABP ] − ICP ) ensure adequate cerebral oxygenation . Brain tumor often associate edema increase ICP specific recommendation CPP threshold brain tumor surgery exist . In daily practice vasopressor use increase MABP maintain CPP 50-70 mmHg accordance current guideline management patient traumatic brain pathology . However , recent study show arterial blood pressure correlate poorly microcirculatory flow . Elevation blood pressure may result reduce capillary perfusion oxygen delivery despite reach resuscitation end-points CPP within 50-70 mmHg . This support experimental study demonstrate vasopressor-induced mismatch cerebral perfusion oxygenation , possibly due microvascular heterogeneity , suggest author . In addition , recent study healthy anesthetized subject demonstrate , despite increase MABP , cerebral oxygenation simultaneously decrease phenylephrine remain unchanged administration ephedrine . Thus , increase CPP vasopressor may lead paradoxical microcirculatory response vasopressor-induced tissue hypo-perfusion hinder tissue oxygenation . Brain microcirculation primary site oxygen exchange . The investigator recently propose red blood cell capillary transit time heterogeneity ( CTTH ) may affect tissue oxygen tension patient ischemic stroke , subarachnoid hemorrhage traumatic brain injury . According theory capillary compression due edema elevate ICP may cause redistribution capillary flow pattern functional shunting oxygenate blood cerebral capillary bed . This capillary dysfunction may hinder oxygen diffusion cerebral tissue ultimately cause cerebral ischemic damage . The dissimilar effect phenylephrine ephedrine cerebral oxygenation may cause different influence brain capillary perfusion alternate CTTH . Currently study available effect commonly use vasopressor brain microcirculation oxygenation patient undergo craniotomy brain tumor . Hypothesis : The use phenylephrine associate reduction brain oxygenation microcirculation compare ephedrine anesthetize patient brain tumor . Specifically investigator hypothesize : 1 . In peritumoral area phenylephrine associate local increase CBF , increase CTTH , decrease oxygen extraction fraction increase BOLD signal compare ephedrine 2 . Phenylephrine associate reduction oxygen extraction fraction ( OEF ) compare ephedrine Materials method : Overall Study design : Double blind control randomized clinical trial . Studies : Study 1 ( MRI study ) . 20 patient randomize infusion either ephedrine phenylephrine MAP &gt; 60 mmHg Study 2 ( PET study ) . 20 patient randomize infusion either ephedrine phenylephrine MAP &gt; 60mmHg MRI PET measurement perform induction general anesthesia propofol remifentanil . The MRI PET sequence perform administration study-drug infusion either phenylephrine ephedrine result MAP &gt; 60mmHg . Depth anesthesia monitor BIS study ensure equal level anesthetic depth two group . NIRS monitor study compare measurement brain oxygenation determine PET/CT . NIRS measurements possible MR scan measure either scan . BIS NIRS register patient case report form ( CRF ) . After MRI/PET study patient transport operating theatre craniotomy perform . After removal bone-flap , subdural ICP measure record previously describe . The overall experimental setup two study . The patient anesthetize MRI PET perform administration study-drug . The specific MRI PET protocol mention - MRI protocol - Conventional MRI sequence high quality research scanner - Diffusion-weighted MRI incl . diffusion kurtosis image - Perfusion-weighted MRI ephedrine phenylephrine , respectively - The duration entire MRI scan estimate 60 min . Two half standard dos gadolinium MRI contrast administer ( 0.25 mmol/kg ) . - PET protocol - Cerebral Blood Flow ( CBF ) : 500 MBq [ 15O ] H2O inject intravenously . At injection three minute PET image acquisition brain start together arterial blood sampling ( also three minute ) automate blood radioactivity sampler draw 7 ml blood per minute . The PET acquisition do Siemens High Resolution Research Tomograph ( HRRT ) list mode . - Cerebral Metabolic Rate Oxygen ( CMRO2 ) : 1000 MBq [ 15O ] O2 inhale immediately exhale . At inhalation PET acquisition blood sample perform protocols identical CBF . - During scan session oxygen saturation haemoglobin concentration measure . Physiological parameter ( blood pressure ICP ) document CRF correspond patient . BIS NIRS data store portable computer subject offline analysis . Parametric non-parametric statistic use compare MRI PET . Physiological data record stimulation study-drugs . The sample size base previous publication MRI protocol perform drug administration anesthetize patient . The exact form apply statistic yet decide . This kind study new parameter MRI PET never do statistical help consult along process . Perspectives : Data propose study add investigator understand cerebral microcirculation importance brain oxygenation patient different age comorbidity . Meanwhile , study provide new insight effect vasopressor cerebral circulation . The study thus provide direct observation investigator recent effort understand role microcirculation neurological disorder , help investigator choose optimal method manage CPP craniotomy brain tumor . These insight may implications future management increase intracranial pressure CPP TBI SAH .
