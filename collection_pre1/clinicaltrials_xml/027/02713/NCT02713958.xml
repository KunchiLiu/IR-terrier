	<detailed_description>The elbow joint important role upper limb function . The rehabilitation process injury complex result common complication elbow trauma , stiffness , restriction range motion occurrence Heterotopic Ossification . According literature , early active mobilization reduces incidence complication . Yet , current treatment protocol base mainly clinical experience lack evidence-based trial regard efficiency . Recently , Occupational Therapists include Telerehabilitation treatment , use advanced technology , adapt orthopedic injury . The reported advantage Telerehabilitation option self-practice without need arrive medical center great motivation practice . This experimental research examine efficacy Telerehabilitation treatment use computerized system ( MediTouch ) improve upper limb function post elbow fracture . This research include 24 participant age 18-80 , hand surgery unit Sheba medical center , post surgery fixate elbow fracture arthrolysis elbow , steady mobilize . Patients diagnose rheumatology , neurological orthopedic condition injury ligaments nerve exclude . The subject match two group accord age fracture type study control group . Both group treat month ambulatory clinic hospital self-practice home . The subject study group receive two treatment Telerehabilitation one treatment clinic weekly , subject control group receive three treatment clinic every week . All subject assess intervention hand function everyday activity use The Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test , disability symptom due injury use The Disabilities arm , shoulder hand questionnaire , pain disability injury elbow use The Patient-Rated Elbow Evaluation , range motion use Goniometer strength use Dynamometer . The Participants study group also fill questionnaire evaluate level satisfaction treatment system usability . The hypothesis test difference group range motion , function satisfaction measure order ass efficacy treatment Telerehabilitation .</detailed_description>
