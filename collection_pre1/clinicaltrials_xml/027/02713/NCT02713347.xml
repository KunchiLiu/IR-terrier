	<detailed_description>Chronic heart failure ( CHF ) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) commonality make ideal early palliative care provide alongside disease-specific treatment . Quality life reduce illness , despite disease-specific treatment , symptom ( e.g. , shortness breath , fatigue ) often persist CHF COPD . Quality life also reduce 50-60 % people either illness clinically significant depressive symptom . Finally , CHF COPD lead cause hospitalization mortality , people either illness engage advance care planning . Providing palliative care concomitantly medical care offer important opportunity improve quality life advance care plan people CHF COPD . For condition lung cancer , provide early , prior end life , palliative care improve quality life , depressive symptom , survival reduce health care utilization . While palliative care well-studied patient advanced cancer , adequately study CHF COPD . The goal proposal determine whether benefit early palliative care extend CHF COPD . The investigator develop demonstrate early success patient-centered palliative care intervention improve quality life ( i.e. , symptom , function ) advance care plan CHF COPD . The intervention consist follow component : ( 1 ) algorithm-guided management breathlessness , fatigue , pain , provide nurse ; algorithms supplement disease-focused treatment palliative behavioral treatment ; ( 2 ) 6-session psychosocial care program target adjustment illness depression , provide social worker ; ( 3 ) engagement patient provider advance care planning . The nurse social worker team palliative care specialist representative primary care provider brief weekly meeting . The team integrate primary care nurse interaction primary care providers electronic medical record ( CPRS ) communication . The investigator conduct hybrid effectiveness implementation study . Population-based sample method use enroll 300 Veterans CHF COPD poor quality life high risk hospitalization death . The primary aim test effectiveness intervention randomize control trial ( intervention vs. enhance usual care ) two VA health care system . In secondary aim , investigator examine implementation intervention guide future implementation dissemination , increase relevance operational partner , maximize effectiveness subsequent palliative care team-based intervention . Aim 1 : Determine effect intervention ( ) quality life primary outcome , ( b ) depression , symptom burden , advance care plan communication documentation , disease-specific health status , emergency department visit , hospitalization , mortality secondary outcome . Aim 2 : Examine implementation intervention . Aim 2a : Assess degree , barrier , facilitator implementation various component . Identify intervention component process critical perspective patient , intervention team member , primary care provider whose patient receive intervention . Aim 2b . Evaluate resource ( e.g. , personnel time cost ) associate intervention , estimate resource need implementation maintenance VA setting . The propose study significant address patient-centered need illnesses major source disability . The study innovative test effectiveness palliative care CHF COPD , lead cause death among Veterans . In addition , intervention integrate primary care , intervention component structure ease replication , implementation , dissemination .</detailed_description>
