Purpose : This multicenter mixed method study primarily aim evaluate efficacy adapted German PRO-SELF© Plus Pain Control Program ( PCP ) pain intensity , explore intervention 's effect associate symptom patient family caregiver ( FC ) outcomes , explore patient ' FCs ' experience cancer pain management . Methods : A nested concurrent mixed method design use multi-center study , , randomize control trial ( RCT ) combine qualitative substudy . Participants randomly assign 6-week intervention usual care group ; outcomes evaluate 6 week post-randomization . The primary outcome pain intensity . A total sample 210 patient cancer pain approximately 105 FCs recruit oncology outpatient clinic University Hospitals Basel , Zurich Bern . The intervention design implement structure tailored component ( information , skill-building , nurse coaching ) aim improve patient ' pain self-management .

	<brief_title>Study Test Efficacy PRO-SELF® Plus Pain Control Program Reduce Pain Outpatients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Between 33 % 64 % cancer patient experience pain ; however , despite effective treatment option , many 40 % patient pain receive adequate pain management . And potential reduce pain show several intervention support patient ' self-management cancer pain , effect date moderate . However , recent randomize control trial ( RCT ) , Miaskowski 's PRO-SELF© Pain Control Program ( PCP ) show statistically clinically significant pain reduction . This intervention subsequently adapt second trial PRO SELF© Plus PCP . The planned multi-center mixed method study base earlier work . In previous pilot study , PRO-SELF© Plus PCP translate adapted German speak population . The feasibility intervention study procedure establish intervention enhance base pilot study 's implication . Purpose : This multi-center mixed method study aim ( 1 ) evaluate efficacy adapted German PRO-SELF© Plus PCP , design improve outpatient ' family caregiver ' ( FCs ) management pain pain intensity ; ( 2 ) explore intervention 's effect associate symptom patient FC outcome ; ( 3 ) explore patient ' FCs ' experience cancer pain management intervention group usual care group ; ( 4 ) interpret quantitative qualitative finding eventually synthesize . To knowledge , first evaluation intervention support pain self-management German speak outpatient cancer relate pain FCs . Methods : A nested concurrent mixed method design use multi-center study , , RCT combine qualitative substudy . Participants complete baseline evaluation , randomly assign 6-week intervention usual care group . Blinding data collector feasible . Participants group complete daily pain symptom diary ; outcomes evaluate 6 week post-randomization . The primary outcome study average worst pain intensity . A total sample 210 patient cancer pain approximately 105 FCs recruit oncology outpatient clinic University Hospitals Basel , Zurich Bern . The intervention design implement structure tailored component ( information , skill-building , nurse coaching ) German PRO-SELF© Plus PCP . Participants receive weekly in-home telephone visit . Data analysis follow intent-to-treat strategy generalize mixed model use . Average per-patient cost intervention calculate . For qualitative substudy , approximately 7-10 patient FCs per group site interview regard experience pain management intervention . Interpretive description use , include stepwise , systematic iterative processing data , lead meaningful description interpretation . Significance : The plan RCT test efficacy adapted German PRO-SELF© Plus PCP , finding qualitative substudy provide additional insight . Qualitative result support interpretation quantitative result vice versa . If efficacious decrease average bad pain patient cancer improve patient ' FCs ' pain self-management , adapted German PRO-SELF© Plus PCP could adapt implemented clinical practice . Specially trained oncology nurse outpatient clinic home care organization could apply intervention need .</detailed_description>
