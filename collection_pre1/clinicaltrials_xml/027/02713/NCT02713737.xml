	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize heat humidified high-flow nasal cannula oxygen ( HFNC ) along high quality sleep , comparison noninvasive positive pressure ventilation ( NIV ) , could reduce release inflammatory marker C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , independent predictor atrial fibrillation（AF） , low incidence new-onset AF follow coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Correlation Between Sleep Quality Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing High-flow Nasal Cannula Oxygen ( HFNC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) report occur 20-40 % patient undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) . Postoperative AF play major role determination hemodynamic deterioration associate thromboembolic stroke . Aside risk factor age , pain , cardiac dysfunction hypokalemia , hypoxemia also consider major contributor AF initiation persistence . Aiming common postoperative complication , noninvasive positive pressure ventilation ( NIV ) provide available modality improve oxygen even obviate reintubation . However , patient contraindication NIV , Loss consciousness , hemodynamic instability , intolerance due dryness , gastric distension , skin breakdown noise , complaint insomnia sleep disturbance . The aforementioned factor largely limit use . Recently , heat humidified high-flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) , free psychic stress physical discomfort , show favorable compliance tolerance treat hypoxemic patient . As result , comfortable set predict high sleep quality HFNC oxygen therapy . Evidence suggest sleep abnormality trigger cascade release C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . As well know CRP involved atrial structural remodel asynchronous conduction , attribute initiation maintenance AF . Therefore , present study , investigator first evaluate sleep quality ( architecture duration ) polysomnographic ( PSG ) monitoring coronary surgery . Based sleep parameter , investigator hypothesize HFNC , along high quality sleep , comparison NIV , could reduce release C-reactive protein , independent predictor atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , low incidence new-onset AF follow CABG .</detailed_description>
