	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease one common diseases cause significant morbidity mortality . Because risk serious cardiovascular event , myocardial infarction death , evident patient population , utmost importance develop diagnostic method identify patient risk . The appropriate diagnostic method safe implement patient physician , also accessible cost-efficient . By use non-invasive technique ultrasound , coronary artery function examine coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) . In platform non-invasive technique use investigator examination cardiovascular status , method include , measurement intima-media thickness carotid radial artery . The investigator goal compare group personalize program placebo , compare two study-groups , investigate whether personalized program provide great health benefit .</detailed_description>
