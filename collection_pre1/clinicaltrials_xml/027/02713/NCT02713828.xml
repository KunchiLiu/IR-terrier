	<brief_summary>Patients advance metastatic , gpNMB-expressing Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( SCC ) lung fail prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen receive glembatumumab vedotin . Glembatumumab vedotin consist antibody ( type human protein ) attach drug call Monomethyl Auristatin E ( MMAE ) kill cancer cell . Glembatumumab vedotin intend work specifically direct drug cancer cell . It attach molecule cancer cell call gpNMB , release MMAE inside tumor cell , turn cause cell die . The purpose study see whether glembatumumab vedotin effective treat people advance metastatic squamous cell lung cancer contain gpNMB , examine body handle drug side effect associate glembatumumab vedotin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Glembatumumab Vedotin gpNMB-Expressing , Advanced Metastatic SCC Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer frequent cancer world , annual case worldwide currently estimate one million increase 10 million year 2025 . In United States , despite decline incidence white male recent year , lung cancer still second frequent cancer men ( next prostate ) woman ( next breast cancer ) . This open-label , single arm study glembatumumab vedotin , fully-human IgG2 monoclonal antibody . The activity glembatumumab vedotin may greatest patient overexpress target , gpNMB . This study include dose-escalation phase determine maximum safe tolerate dose . This follow 2-stage Phase II expansion . During Phase II Stage 1 , approximately 20 eligible , treated patient enrol . If ≥ 2 patient achieve tumor response [ Partial Response ( PR ) Complete Response ( CR ) ] ; additional 15 eligible , treated patient enrol Stage 2 , maximum total 35 eligible , treated patient . Glembatumumab vedotin administer every 3 week , 90-minute intravenous ( IV ) infusion . Patients continue treatment disease progression intolerance . Tumor assessment perform every six ( ±1 ) week six month , every nine ( ±2 ) week thereafter , progression . A tumor tissue sample ( i.e. , obtain previous procedure biopsy ) send central laboratory test gpNMB . Research blood sample also require .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Read , understood , provide write informed consent Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) authorization nature study fully explain must willing comply study requirement procedure . 2 . Male female patient metastatic , histologically cytologicallyconfirmed unresectable Stage IIIB IV nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) squamous histology ( Staging per American Joint Committee Cancer [ AJCC ] , Edition 7 ) . Mixed histology adenosquamous NSCLC also permit . 3 . Experienced progression/recurrence disease subsequent recent anticancer regimen . 4 . Any number prior line systemic therapy may receive advanced ( recurrent , locally advanced , metastatic ) SCC lung , least one must platinumbased chemotherapy regimen . Platinum therapy may give onlabel part clinical trial . 5 . Lung cancer confirm express gpNMB , assess immunohistochemistry central lab ( use expression ≥ 5 % tumor epithelial cell cutoff positivity ) . This test archived tissue available , although preferred tumor specimen biopsy recent therapy . 6 . Age ≥ 18 year . 7 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 1 . 8 . Measurable disease RECIST 1.1 criterion . Target lesion select tumor measurement surgical resection radiation indicate anticipate . 9 . Resolution toxicity relate prior therapy ≤ NCICTCAE Grade 1 severity , except alopecia , vitiligo , endocrinopathies replacement therapy . 10 . Adequate bone marrow function assess absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/mm3 ; hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL , platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 . 11 . Adequate renal function assess serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL ; calculate 24hour urine creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min . 12 . Adequate liver function assess total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5x ULN ( ≤ 5.0x ULN case liver metastasis ) . Patients know Gilbert 's syndrome may enrol total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL . 13 . Both male female patient childbearing potential enrolled trial must use adequate birth control measure course trial least one month discontinue study drug . 14 . Willing provide blood sample research purpose . 1 . Received glembatumumab vedotin ( CR011vcMMAE ; CDX011 ) MMAEcontaining agent previously . 2 . Chemotherapy within 21 day least 5 halflives prior plan start study treatment ; radiation outside thorax within 14 day prior plan start study treatment thoracic radiation ; antibody base therapy investigational therapy within 28 day prior plan start study treatment . 3 . Neuropathy &gt; NCICTCAE Grade 1 . 4 . Subjects history allergic reaction attribute compound similar composition dolastatin auristatin . Compounds similar composition include Auristatin PHE antifungal agent , Auristatin PE ( TZT1027 , Soblidotin , NSC654663 ) antitumor agent Symplostatin 1 antitumor agent . 5 . Known brain metastasis , unless previously treat patient neurologically return baseline except residual sign symptom related Central Nervous System ( CNS ) treatment CNS lesion progressive size number 4 week . 6 . Significant cardiovascular disease include unstable angina pectoris , uncontrolled hypertension , congestive heart failure relate primary cardiac disease , history serious uncontrollable arrhythmia despite treatment , ischemic severe valvular heart disease , myocardial infarction within 6 month prior trial entry . 7 . Active systemic infection require treatment . Infection control oral therapy exclusionary . 8 . Subjects immunosuppressive medication azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , cyclosporine require chronic corticosteroid use ( define ≥ 3 month prednisone dose equivalent ≥ 10 mg ) . 9 . The MMAE component glembatumumab vedotin primarily metabolize CYP3A . Patients take strong CYP3A inhibitor inducer exclude Phase I ( dose escalation portion ) , minimize effect modulators exposure , tolerability dose selection . 10 . History malignancy except adequately treat basal squamous cell skin cancer , curatively treat situ disease , cancer patient diseasefree ≥ 2 year . 11 . Pregnant breastfeed woman . 12 . Any underlying medical condition , Investigator 's opinion , make administration study treatment hazardous patient , would obscure interpretation adverse event .</criteria>
