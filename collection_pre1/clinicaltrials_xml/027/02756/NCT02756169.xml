	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Maternal obesity alters composition breast milk beyond influence diet : low concentration polyamines , alter pattern saturate trans- fatty acid , reduce mono- polyunsaturated fatty acid . In addition , alter bioactive component also observe regulatory factor growth hormone , regulatory metabolic adiponectin , immunologic factor , cytokine , among others . There relationship indicator infant growth body composition ; case leptin concentrate woman obesity . There find breastfed infant obese woman great weight gain breastfed infant normal weight woman . Biological factor : breastfeed bit delayed primiparous woman mother obesity . Obesity delay copious production breast milk ( Lactogenesis stage II ) concur synthesis prolactin ( PRL ) , response decrease suck child . In addition attenuate neurological response , low chronic inflammation level ( particular obesity ) production cytokine proinflammatory adipose tissue zinc sequestration endoplasmic reticulum lysosomes epithelial cell mammary gland , activate process premature recession , compromise establishment copious milk production cause premature weaning . Another biological alteration mother obesity suffer alter glucose management , compromise milk production . In addition biological alteration , obese mother higher risk complication delivery ; common experience great physiological stress high probability caesarean , metabolically interfere breastfeed delays establishment . Physical factor excess subcutaneous fat area areola mother obesity cause discomfort stress mother cry infant , hinder correct latch infant nipple , weaken neurological stimulus trigger Prolactin production . In addition , psychosocial factor complicate breastfeed overweight woman ; obese mother report increased feeling insufficient milk , compare non-obese mother . In addition , woman obesity report low self-efficacy pair without obesity . Despite implementation educational intervention promote establishment breastfeed obese woman , result favorable increase prevalence breastfeeding . Teaching technique Communication program promote breastfeed design attack main problem . Insufficient knowledge process establish breastfeeding , negative attitude towards breastfeed mother people around ( family , health personnel , complication immediate postpartum ) . In study , effective interpersonal communication strategy deal problem discuss group game . Also , investigator use large number strategy optimize opportunity change behavior . To help improve practice woman obesity , raise follow research question : An intervention specifically design lessen problem establish breastfeed woman obesity , include : educational intervention support pregnancy , immediate postpartum period first year life ; increase frequency exclusive predominant breastfeed first month life , total duration breastfeeding ? METHODOLOGY PHASE 1 INTERVENTION DESIGN The intervention make information derived focus group ( FG ) . The main objective identify barrier mother obesity breastfeeding ( discomfort , delay produce milk copiously , flat nipple , among others ) explore ideas overcome . For purpose , FG derive element design communication component accord real experience aim problem breastfeed obese woman . The communication theory use Communication Health strategy structure activity . Investigators develop guide lead FG discussion allow investigator identify factor influence performance breastfeed obese pregnant woman . The main characteristic woman participate FG pregnant woman obesity , distinction primiparous primiparous woman breastfed least 6 month . Validation message Investigators perform comparison message derive analysis FG group mother participate FG ensure message relevant clear . Workshop Design . With expert learn technique collaborator , investigator design workshop validate message derive FG complement use experience IBCLC . The workshop divide three stage : - First stage : Basics breastfeed significance health baby mother . - Second stage : discussion problem may arise , particularly mother obesity . Recommendations appropriate technique solve problem give trough Games communication activity drive . - Third stage : Treatment common problem counsel solve . PHASE 2 . IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERVENTION . Step 1 . Enrollment . This stage schedule take place within 5 month two strategy : 1 ) previous authorization Health Ministry Mexico City , investigator request information census health jurisdiction pregnant woman identify , ; 2 ) investigator approach pregnant woman time attend medical consultation . Once investigator identify pregnant woman , ask pregnant woman inform consent ( adult ) / write assent ( adolescent ) obtain information since eligibility criterion evaluate . These criterion : age ≥15 year old , presence obesity ( IMC &gt; 29 ) , week gestation ( 22 33 w ) , absence chronic illness contraindicate breastfeeding ( HIV AIDS , hepatitis , etc. , except diabetes ) , consume drug contraindicate lactation , case multiple pregnancy , consider eldest child twin ( two baby pregnant woman exclude study ) , absence breast reduction surgery , may continue live Mexico City delivery . In step , investigator estimate necessity screen approximately 3,700 woman potential participant . Once pregnant woman meet criterion identify , investigator ask another informed consent write assent explain detail whole study , invite participate . Also , sociodemographic data self-efficacy questionnaire ( questionnaire feeling participant capable breastfed baby ) collect . The aim recruit 200 woman . Then , investigator assign randomly one woman study group ( intervention group control group ) . Step 2 . Basal phase . Once woman assign study group begin intervention consider baseline study . Activities Control group : The woman assign group monitor telephone ask breastfeed performance . Investigators call month 6 month age baby , every two month child´s first year old . Women assign group option ( make choice ) take course standardly organize health center . To encourage pregnant reach course , staff educational program health center invite physician , nurse , social worker ; let know existence group importance invite pregnant woman take . Also , course promote staff health center . Some topic course direct care mother others newborn 's care . At immediate postpartum : Investigators identify arrival woman study five hospital select study . For woman control group , investigator collect data self-efficacy , birth health condition , baby mother delivery . &lt; Activities Intervention group &gt; The intervention set different time : 1 . During pregnancy ( second third trimester pregnancy ) : workshop particularly design solve doubt problem breastfeed , show health benefit infant mother health . The workshop base mainly material develop FC assistance International Board Certified Lactation Consultant ( IBCLC ) Mexico . It ensure cover educational material , communication practical , recommend WHO Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative . For group , ask another self-efficacy questionnaire end workshop . 2 . At immediate postpartum : Investigators identify arrival woman study five hospital select study . For intervention group , addition collection data health condition mother baby , one IBCLC attend provide immediate support establishment breastfeeding within first hour old baby . The IBCLC may solve doubt mother ; give support , supervise guide initiation breastfeeding , explain proper grip , suggest ideal position breastfeed mother newborn , support suppose intensive . All activity must coordinate physician nurse five hospital order follow rule requirement hospital establish . 3 . After delivery first year life child : intervention consist two step . 1 . During first 7 day life infant . An IBCLC call mother daily . 2 . A telephonic follow-up 2 week old baby , phone call month reach 6 month ; , every two month baby one year life . With call , investigator pretend collect information duration type feeding . There possibility support hold via `` Skype '' woman prefer . &lt; Activities group ( intervention control ) &gt; Investigators deliver write relevant information recommend alimentation woman postpartum well ideas physical activity , go walk , household chore involve physical exertion . This technical information derive literature express simple accessible way . Each issue send separately , ie , three time send information . For woman leave study first year child , investigator send information . *Baseline measurement women* Measurements shall make mother control intervention group . Investigators develop pre-test quantitative instrument measure follow variable : Self-efficacy breastfeeding problem related infant woman . Sociodemographic characteristic : Through questionnaire investigator ask household member , household head , marital status education participant , housing characteristic ( number room , floor material roof material ) possession household good ( TV , radio , computer , vehicle , etc. ) . In addition , investigator ask participant formal employment receive payment type work perform . General characteristic infant : sex , gestational age birth , type birth ( birth caesarean section ) . Infant anthropometry : During woman 's hospital stay , length weight data measure calculate Z-score weight / age , length / age , weight / length indicator . Diagnosis infant : evaluation make newborn protocol , include Apgar score one five minute , Silverman Andersen 10 minute neonatal complication , clinical disease condition , obtain medical record medical report . Initial food : first time elapse time since baby bear feed . PHASE 3 . FOLLOW-UP At month postpartum , investigator visit participant home , control group intervention group , information breastfeeding practice . Also mother , breast milk sample take determine composition fatty acid , blood sample determine C-Reactive Protein also investigator collect dietary information . Then child measure infant growth ( weight , length , skinfold thickness ) take . The project staff standardize newborn anthropometric measurement , follow technique Lohman . Measurements obtain mother : -Breastfeeding practice : Through questionnaire ask type food infant receive . Investigators ask time infant receive breastfeeding , exclusive . A sample breast milk determination fatty acid C-reactive protein serum marker inflammation determine . -Infant Measurements Infant growth : During home visit , weight , length head circumference infant measurement take specified technique . In addition , skinfold ( triceps , biceps , subscapularis ) shall measure calculate indicator : triceps skinfold / age subscapular skinfold / age head circumference . For measurement , project staff also train standardize . Sample size statistical power Investigators study 200 obese pregnant woman , 100 per study group . This sample size calculate detect difference prevalence exclusive breastfeeding ( one month postpartum ) 10 percent ( 12 22 % ) , statistical power 90 % , level significance &gt; 0.05 , nonresponse rate 50 % 15 % abandonment postpartum . To achieve sample size , recruitment hold 5 month , hop incorporate study , least , two woman daily . This calculation perform use information number woman could meet inclusion criterion study . To achieve sample size , investigator estimate screen total 3,700 woman primary care level health service order identify woman meet inclusion criterion describe . According similar study , calculate number woman need get 200 woman ( 100 group ) investigator follow : All pregnant woman attend health center n= 3,700 It expect least 34 % woman body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 29 n= 1,258 It expect 40 % meet inclusion criterion n= 503 Only 50 % agree participate n= 251 Approximately 80 % give birth reference hospital n= 200 Data management Study participant assign unique identification number . A subject identification list create , include subject identification number , personal information contact information subject participate study . Only main investigator access list order make possible trace identify individual subject . This list also help carry medical auditing . For analysis data management , identification number use order ensure confidentiality privacy subject . Once data collect fieldworker , complete questionnaire bring headquarters study , supervisor check potential mistake miss information . Investigators use case report form per participant , checklist information collect quality , record . The case report form fill field supervisor every time check file subject . The purpose case report form monitor quality information collect , check information collect time . Data entry perform continuously course study . Data enter duplicate quality control . In case miss data error data collection , field worker go back participant recover information possible . Regular backup databases procedure conduct . Statistical processing analysis STATA version 13.1 statistical package use process information describe study population characteristic , make test result two group , explore trend obtain average length BF intervention group . Evaluate change measurement growth infant birth 12 month life . Analysis Plan Descriptive statistic ( summary measure , accord variable type measurement scale ) descriptive analysis include mean , median , standard error variance stage data collection ( baseline follow-up ) , applicable . To analyze baseline difference study group , comparison group make difference proportion test categorical variable test continuous variable . The statistic test include design information , adjust standard error apply continuity correction . For analysis sociodemographic information , cluster analysis use identify group interest consider characteristic woman . Analytical inferential statistic ( test apply type variable : necessary , statistical hypothesis test procedure ) . To evaluate effect intervention data analyze panel data comparison mean variance . ANOVA , ANCOVA MANOVA compare group : analysis variance without intervention within group . To evaluate relationship obesity breastfeed performance investigator use regression model conduct sociodemographic anthropometric participant child include . On hand , regression model conduct analyze relationship composition breast milk infant 's growth one month 12 month . All analysis do intent treatment . Qualitative analysis For analysis educational intervention , qualitative analysis carry satisfaction survey open-ended questionnaire .</detailed_description>
