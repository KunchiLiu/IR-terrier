	<brief_title>Venetoclax Ibrutinib Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive study drug study cycle 4 week ( 28 day ) long . You take 3 capsule ibrutinib 1 time every day study 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . If miss dose ibrutinib , take soon possible day return normal schedule follow day . You take extra capsule follow day make miss dose . Beginning Day 1 Cycle 4 , also take tablet venetoclax 1 time every day rest study . Each dose venetoclax take time ibrutinib 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water , within 30 minute finish eat low-fat breakfast . In order low risk side effect , start take venetoclax low dose increase week direct doctor take full dose . If vomit within 15 minute take venetoclax tablet still intact , another dose may take . Otherwise , take another dose . In case dose venetoclax miss forgotten , take dose soon possible , long within 8 hour dose plan take . You also give standard drug help decrease risk side effect begin 3 day first dose venetoclax . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Tumor Lysis Syndrome Monitoring : Starting 3 day receive first dose venetoclax ( continue least 5 week treatment ) , give drug lower risk serious side effect call Tumor Lysis Syndrome ( TLS ) . TLS happen cancer cell break rapidly . The break-down product enter bloodstream flush quickly enough . You blood test ( 2 tablespoon time ) dose may blood test ( 2 tablespoon ) 4 , 8 , 12 24 hour dose . Based test result , study doctor may instructions , may need meet kidney doctor hospital . You hospitalize first dose venetoclax check treat TLS . You may need receive fluid vein . Study Visits : Every week Cycle 1 , every 2 week Cycles 2 3 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Days 1 15 Cycle 1 , Day 1 Cycles 2 3 , physical exam . At end Cycles 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 27 , every 6-12 month : - You bone marrow aspiration/biopsy check status disease . - You CT PET scan . Every week Cycle 4 , every 2 week Cycles 5 6 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Every week Cycles 4 5 , Days 1 15 Cycle 6 , physical exam . On Day 1 Cycles 7 beyond : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Physical exam blood draw may do often doctor think need . Length Treatment : You may receive venetoclax 2 year . You may continue receive ibrutinib long study doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . This investigational study . Ibrutinib FDA approve commercially available treatment patient mantle cell lymphoma patient CLL receive least 1 prior treatment . Its use study investigational . Venetoclax FDA approve commercially available . The combination venetoclax ibrutinib investigational . The study doctor describe study drug design work . Up 78 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
