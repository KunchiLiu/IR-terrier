	<brief_summary>This single center , open label , prospective , randomize , control study patient non- revascularizable moderate severe low extremity Peripheral Arterial Disease ( PAD ) receive autologous stem cell therapy ( minimally manipulate ) . This study enroll maximum 10 subject study . The patient divide two group . One group receive Adipose Derived Stem Cells ( ADSCs ) alone group receive low frequency ultrasound addition ADSCs . The randomization 1:1 . If result pilot study clearly different , need phase II study support result . Baseline , 6 week , 3 month 6 month assessment 6 min walk distance ( 6MWT ) , Ankle Brachial Indexes ( ABIs ) /Toe Brachial Indexes ( TBIs ) , Transcutaneous Partial Oxygenation ( TcPO2 ) Rutherford assessments perform study group . Prior stem cell treatment , ultrasound group patient receive noninvasive transcutaneous pulse focused ultrasound around involved vessel ( ) affect extremity . All patient receive 200 million autologous stromal vascular fraction cell contain adipose derive stem cell therapy : 1/3 cell deliver intra-venous proximal lesion ( retrograde ) , 1/3 cell deliver intra- adventitia proximal lesion 1/3 cell deliver intra- muscular injection along vessel path ( 20-30 injection separate by1.5 inch ) . Standard therapy PAD patient interrupted duration study . Standard therapy PAD define cardiovascular general measure like lifestyle change , smoke cessation , exercise , cardiovascular rehabilitation , etc . All participant already receive maximal non-surgical therapy . Safety monitor ongoing basis .</brief_summary>
