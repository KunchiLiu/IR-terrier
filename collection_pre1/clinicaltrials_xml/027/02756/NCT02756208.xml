	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 randomize , placebo-controlled , modify double-blinded dose escalation study 60 healthy adult volunteer Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 ( HIV-1 ) uninfected . Participants study receive 4 injection 0 , 4 , 8 24 week follow additional 24 week . The total study duration 48 week . As Phase 1 trial , primary objective document safety Full Length Single Chain ( FLSC ) gp120-CD4 complex vaccine secondary objective evaluate immune response induce vaccine . This vaccine evaluate constructed gp120 CD4 moiety form stable intra-chain binding interaction form transition state structure present conserve , conformational domain involve early HIV replication process . It hypothesize antibody direct epitope would highly cross-reactive potentially useful HIV vaccine development .</detailed_description>
