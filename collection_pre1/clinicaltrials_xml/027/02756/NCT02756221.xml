	<detailed_description>Masters runner professional competitive cyclist recruit , follow : 30 young road cyclist age 18-39 year , 60 master runner age 40-60 year Sample Size : 90 subject recruit , follow first set test experiment randomly divide two matched group experimental experimental group . The rational sample size calculation base detecting defined effect size 5 % statistical significance 80 % power . Effect size reflect difference treatment effect group calculate difference measurement value experimental ( probiotic ) control ( placebo ) group divide standard deviation . Cyclists ' cohort include 34 subject demonstrate effect size 1.0 . Masters runner ' cohort include 60 subject demonstrate effect size 0.75 . Study design : A random double-blind prospective study Recruitment participant execute study staff also serve trainer cycle run group Israel 's Upper Galilee area . Subsequently sign inform consent form one study physician , participant complete follow procedure : - A series preliminary test ( Anthropometry , Maximal Oxygen Consumption , Endurance test ) conduct one study physicians Ziv Medical Center Zefat - Food Frequency Questionnaires ( FFQ ) frequency GI symptom complete electronically Qualtrics ( Qualtrics LLC , Provo , UT , USA ) - Blood sample ( approximately 10 ml venous blood ) quantify immune factor ( inflammation ) collect Ziv Medical Center Tel Hai Academic College send molecular microbiology biotechnology laboratory Tel Aviv University . - Stool sample test genetic expression microbiome composition . The test deliver study staff Tel Hai University freezing , send together dry ice molecular microbiology biotechnology laboratory Tel Aviv University - Tests evaluate aerobic endurance ( Lactate Threshold - cyclist , run economy time fatigue - runner ) conduct exercise physiology laboratory Tel Hai College . After completion test , participant randomly divide 2 match group accord level physical fitness , age double-blind design . The experimental ( E ) group give probiotic supplement capsule form whereas control ( C ) group give placebo capsule identical size color probiotic one . The participant consume supplement / placebo capsule period 90 day return additional visit re-complete questionnaire undergo identical test procedure complete first visit ( assignment group ) .</detailed_description>
