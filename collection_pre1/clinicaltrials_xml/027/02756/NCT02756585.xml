	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) lead cause post-injury hospitalization , disability , death worldwide . In Nova Scotia , approximately 50 % major trauma report head trauma . TBI predict common expensive neurological condition Canada year 2031 . Families medical team must often decide appropriate level care patient severe TBI frequently need consider withdrawal life support measure . These decision implication patient severe TBI , cost health care system , rate organ donation . A reliable method neurological evaluation time patient 's arrival hospital important , possible many patient severe TBI already permanent brain damage . Assessing brain damage clinical test difficult nature patient ' injury sedative medication receive time hospital admission . Current standard imaging technique patient severely limited assessment extent severity brain damage . Advanced diagnostic imaging , call Computed Tomography Perfusion ( CTP ) , help detect permanent brain damage . However , CTP head currently do patient severe TBI arrive hospital . The investigator want test whether CTP head detect permanent brain damage among patient severe TBI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computed Tomography Perfusion Patients With Severe Head Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To demonstrate CTP useful assess patient severe TBI , investigator conduct large study multiple hospital across Canada . Before conduct large study , investigator need make sure feasible add CTP head routine imaging patient severe TBI undergo time arrival hospital . The current study pilot study test feasibility add CTP image head routine imaging protocol patient severe TBI time hospital admission . The propose feasibility study help determine many participant investigator need large study attain significant result whether investigator need modify investigator study method . Participants undergo image protocol CTP head time initial diagnostic imaging upon hospital arrival . Non-contrast CT ( NCCT ) head perform part current imaging protocol severe TBI patient . At time NCCT , participant undergo whole-brain CTP protocol , ensure coverage entire brainstem . A total 40 mL nonionic iodinate contrast medium inject . Images acquire accord investigator previously publish image protocol . Cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) cerebral blood volume ( CBV ) image CTP qualitatively assess presence absence match decrease CBF CBV brainstem . CTP assess independently two radiologist blind . If disagreement arise , resolved discussion .</detailed_description>
