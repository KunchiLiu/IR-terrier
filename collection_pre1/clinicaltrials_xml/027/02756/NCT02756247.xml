	<brief_summary>The purpose study find combination buparlisib ibrutinib lead well treatment result patient relapsed refractory Follicular lymphoma , ( FL ) Mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . The investigator use buparlisib ibrutinib drug seem block different protein allow cancer cell keep grow . Blocking protein may help make cancer cell undergo cell death , stop uncontrolled tumor growth .</brief_summary>
