Aim 3 capitalize TIPQC 's robust network NICUs , neonatologists , patient-level outcome data conduct pilot implementation evaluation method tool develop refine Aims 1-2 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Non-Routine Events Neonatal Safety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonates highly vulnerable iatrogenic event due size , fragility , severe sensitivity environmental stressor . Patient safety research neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) show attribute increase care complexity reduce capacity neonates endure even small care deviation . As result , neonates experience adverse event rate high 8 time report hospitalized adult . Adverse event estimate occur rate 74 event per every 100 NICU patient ( 0-11 Adverse Event ( AE ) /patient ) , third severe event . The vulnerability neonate expose perioperative environment , little patient safety research conduct . In addition prevailing risk surgical patient ( e.g. , misidentification , position error , wrong site side , retain foreign body , etc . ) , neonate increase risk handover ( e.g. , NICU nurse Operating Room team ) , transport ( e.g. , monitoring ) , intraoperative event ( e.g. , weight-based dosing , temperature control , etc. ) . The objective multi-site study improve neonatal safety apply novel event discovery methodology determine etiology system failures perioperative environment . The investigator use construct non-routine event ( NRE ) efficiently capture dysfunctional clinical microsystem attribute potentially dangerous condition . A NRE define event perceive care provider skilled observer deviation optimal care base clinical situation . NREs encompass substantially large class event conventional patient safety metric , include sentinel event , medical error , `` near miss '' . In prior study , minimize number deviation standard care , minor problem , disruption case show result smoother , safer , short surgery . Moreover , preliminary study member research team , intraoperative NREs appear associate 30-day surgical mortality morbidity . The Investigators propose comprehensive 4-year study neonatal patient safety perioperative environment produce knowledge base require inform high-impact intervention study guide rapid cycle quality improvement . The study 's Aims : 1a ) Determine prevalence characteristic NREs perioperative care neonate ; 1b ) Delineate relationship ( ) NREs , contributory factor , surgical mortality major morbidity neonatal perioperative care ; 2 ) Perform comparative analysis prospective NRE data collection conventional event reporting methodology within clinical environment ; 3 ) Collaborate Tennessee Initiative Perinatal Quality Improvement ( TIPQC ) conduct practical pilot testing tool measure refine Aims 1-3 . The investigator anticipate knowledge gain neonatal safety model develop data collect prospectively three child 's hospital test within TIPQC collaborative guide future intervention study . A product project patient safety registry surgical neonate . The registry include sample approximately 500 neonatal patient receive first-time non-cardiac surgical intervention Monroe Carell Jr. Children 's Hospital Vanderbilt . Neonates receive NICU care pre- post-operatively eligible study . The registry include follow data element : NRE data capture prospectively NICU pre-operatively , intraoperatively , post-operatively , respectively , trained observer ; contributory factor include factor related patient , clinician , equipment , logistics , work environment ; 30-day National Surgical Quality Improvement Project-Pediatric ( NSQIP-P ) morbidity mortality outcomes . NRE severity categorize cod : 1 . Serious Safety Event ( SSE ) ; 2 . Precursor Safety Event ( PSE ) , 3 . Near Miss Safety Event ( NME ) base Safety Event Classification ( SEC ) system taxonomy . Surgical morbidity categorize use NSQIP-P taxonomy classify Serious ( Moderate Temporary Harm Severe Permanent Harm ) Not Serious ( No Harm Minimal Permanent Harm ) use SEC definition level harm .</detailed_description>
