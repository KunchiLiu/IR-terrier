	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study well early stem cell transplantation work treat patient high-grade myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia come back period improvement respond treatment . Drugs use chemotherapy , filgrastim , cladribine , cytarabine mitoxantrone hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving chemotherapy donor peripheral blood cell transplant help stop growth cell bone marrow , include normal blood-forming cell ( stem cell ) cancer cell . When healthy stem cell donor infused patient may help patient 's bone marrow make stem cell , red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . The donated stem cell may also replace patient 's immune cell help destroy remain cancer cell . Early stem cell transplantation may result successful treatment patient myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory High-Grade Myelodysplastic Syndrome Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate feasibility `` early '' allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT ) patient relapse refractory ( R/R ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate relapse-free survival ( RFS ) , acute graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , treatment related mortality ( TRM ) , event-free survival ( EFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , complete remission ( without measurable disease ) among patient receive early HCT . II . Assess factor distinguish patient receive early HCT . III . Compare RFS , EFS , OS , acute GVHD , TRM patient feasibility study match patient transplanted standard scheduling . IV . Demonstrate feasibility collect patient-reported outcome resource utilization data trial participant . V. Describe outcomes patient enrol go allogeneic HCT off-study . OUTLINE : RE-INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) day 0-5 , mitoxantrone hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1-3 , cladribine IV 2 hour day 1-5 , cytarabine IV 2 hour day 1-5 . Treatment continue maximum 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . CONDITIONING REGIMEN : Beginning 14-60 day re-induction chemotherapy , patient receive fludarabine phosphate IV 30 minute day -6 -2 melphalan IV day -3 -2 . EARLY TRANSPLANT : Patients undergo allogeneic HCT condition regimen day 0 . GVHD PROPHYLAXIS : Patients receive mycophenolate mofetil orally ( PO ) three time daily ( TID ) day 0-30 , twice daily ( BID ) day 40 , cyclosporine PO BID day -3 96 , taper day 150 . Patients also receive sirolimus PO day -3 150 , taper day 180 . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
