	<brief_summary>Cervicocerebral artery dissection major cause stroke young adult . While knowledge cervical artery dissection ( CeAD ) increase thanks number high quality study , knowledge intracranial artery dissection ( IAD ) limit . Due treatment publication bias little known natural history IAD . Overall , IAD assume severe course CeAD , ominous outcome patient subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) . Furthermore , little information available risk recurrent IAD well risk recurrent ischemic haemorrhagic event non-Asian patient . Radiological diagnosis IAD challenge give small size intracranial artery , subtle non-specific radiological sign tend evolve time . The optimal treatment IAD unknown . There randomised trial observational study relatively small sample size available , thus provide low level evidence . Finding factor decisive outcome recurrence intracranial artery dissection key improve management potentially severe disease predominantly affect young patient . By use standardised protocol diagnosis , image follow-up , investigator intend obtain large representative patient sample order fill gap evidence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cervicocephalic artery dissection correspond hematoma wall cervical intracranial artery important cause stroke child young middle-aged adult . While extracranial cervical artery dissection ( CeAD ) extensively study describe , less information available pure intracranial artery dissection ( IAD ) involve cervical portion artery . Early report base exclusively autopsy series , hence bias towards severe case . The incidence IAD unknown , probably low incidence symptomatic CeAD population European origin . The proportion IAD among cervicocephalic dissection varies substantially ethnic age group , depend study recruitment strategy ascertainment method . Indeed , recruitment department neurology bias towards CeAD IAD present local symptom and/or ischaemic stroke recruitment department neurosurgery interventional neuroradiology bias towards IAD present subarachnoid haemorrhage ( SAH ) .Therefore , patient IAD manage neurologist , also neurosurgeon , interventional neuroradiologists , incomplete picture disease . The vast majority report series IAD patient come Asian country IAD affect posterior circulation frequently anterior circulation series . This contrast CeAD saccular intracranial aneurysm , commonly affect anterior circulation . Due treatment publication bias little known natural history IAD . Overall , IAD assume severe course CeAD , ominous outcome patient SAH IAD patient non-SAH IAD . Furthermore , little information available risk recurrent IAD well risk recurrent ischaemic haemorrhagic event . Radiological diagnosis IAD challenge give small size intracranial artery , subtle non-specific radiological sign tend evolve time . The optimal treatment IAD unknown . There randomised trial observational study relatively small sample size available , thus provide low level evidence . Patients SAH IAD usually treat surgery endovascular procedure 40 % patient experience re-bleeding within first day event . Various surgical endovascular treatment method propose intracranial dissect aneurysm . When patient poor clinical condition treatment unacceptably high complication risk , decide withhold surgical endovascular treatment . In addition , Most non-SAH IAD patient treat medically , choice antithrombotic therapy ( anticoagulant antiplatelet agent ) evaluate neither randomised trial systematic review meta-analyses observational data . As consequence , currently consensus optimal treatment IAD .</detailed_description>
