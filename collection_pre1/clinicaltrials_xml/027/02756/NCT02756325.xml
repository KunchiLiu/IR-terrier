	<brief_summary>Infertility-the inability conceive despite one year properly time unprotected intercourse-is common problem . Of type male factor infertility , non-obstructive azoospermia may difficult couple . Importantly , patient non-obstructive azoospermia ask make difficult decision term reproductive choice ; surgical attempt identify sperm ( microdissection testicular sperm extraction ) often offer patient without guarantee able identify sperm . New methodology term evaluation azoospermic male PRIOR couple embark upon IVF need urgently . The potential benefit non-invasive determination testis function spermatogenesis would potential target sperm extraction procedure . We hypothesize quantitative MRI employ advanced functional metric sensitive functional metabolic difference subsets azoospermic case improve upon current characterization patient condition . Moreover , believe technique provide complementary information , may combine synergistic fashion target extraction methodology .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quantitative MRI Functional Imaging Testis : A New Methodology Evaluation Infertile Male</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Of type male factor infertility , non-obstructive azoospermia may difficult couple . Azoospermia ( obstructive non-obstructive ) occur approximately 10-20 % infertile male non-obstructive azoospermia encompass majority case . In study , quantitative MRI investigate employ advanced functional metric address challenge . Specifically , diffusion-weighted imaging assess , multi-echo T2 mapping , arterial-spin labeling , spectroscopy . No intravenous contrast administer purpose study . It hypothesize technique sensitive functional metabolic difference subsets azoospermic case improve upon current characterization patient condition . Moreover , believe technique provide complementary information , may combine synergistic fashion target extraction methodology . The goal exploratory study investigate whether association exist quantitative MRI metric previously note feature testis architecture .</detailed_description>
