	<brief_title>Regulation Stem Spermatogonia Mature Testis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An essential requirement sustain male fertility maintain adequate number stem spermatogonia , foundation spermatogenesis . To achieve , stem cell divide , progeny must remain stem spermatogonia progeny differentiate . It obvious correct balance self-renewing replication differentiation stem spermatogonia crucial male fertility , indirect evidence GDNF play important role maintain balance normal mature testis . However , almost nothing known vivo regulation balance mature organ , specific function GDNF adult testis , physiological change GDNF expression significantly affect replication differentiation stem cell . To address critical issue , unique mouse model allow GDNF signal stem spermatogonia specifically reversibly inhibit vivo ATP antagonist . With model , first direct evidence GDNF require maintain stem spermatogonial pool normal mature testis . Additionally , investigator show inhibition GDNF signaling reverse , stem cell begin rebuild stem cell pool . Importantly , data demonstrate stem spermatogonia lose GDNF signal inhibit little 2 day , stem cell survive 11 day . This suggest factor intrinsic extrinsic stem cell modulate response GDNF . Using new mouse model mechanism responsible loss stem spermatogonia proliferation regeneration investigate along GDNF signal inhibition . At end study do waste tissue obtain normal men men infertility otherwise testicular surgery therapeutic purpose .</detailed_description>
