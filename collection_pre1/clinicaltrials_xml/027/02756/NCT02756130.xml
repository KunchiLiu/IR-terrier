	<brief_title>Proof-of-concept Study Birinapant Combination With Platinum Based Chemotherapy Subjects With High Grade Serous Carcinomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants newly diagnose disease receive follow treatment Each participant receive total six 21-day cycle chemotherapy treatment day 1 day 8 . Patients undergo interval debulking surgery ( IDS ) complete 3 cycle chemotherapy follow remain 3 cycle chemotherapy . Day 1 : Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV 3 hour Carboplatin AUC ( area curve ) 5 IV Birinapant 35 mg/m2 IV 30 minute Day 8 : Birinapant 35 mg/m2 IV 30 minute Participants recurrent disease receive follow treatment Day 1 : Carboplatin AUC ( area curve ) 5 IV Birinapant 35 mg/m2 IV 30 minute Day 8 : Birinapant 35 mg/m2 IV 30 minute</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants eligible study participation meet follow inclusion criterion , participant provide write informed consent . 1 . The participant female ≥ 18 year age . 2 . All patient must measurable disease image defined tumor measure ≥ 10 mm multiparametric MRI ( primary modality image ) CT ( alternative ) ≥ 10 mm caliper physical examination . 3 . Participant capable understand comply parameter outline protocol able sign date inform consent , approve Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) /Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , prior initiation screen studyspecific procedure . 4 . The participant must histologic diagnosis advanced , newly diagnose recurrent high grade serous cancer ( ovarian , tubal , peritoneal , endometrial ) , treat chemotherapy . 5 . Participants must either undergo surgery would yield fresh tumor image guide biopsy perform yield fresh tissue vitro organoid bioassay two biomarker test ( western blot immunohistochemistry ) . 6 . Only patient tumor score positive vitro organoid bioassay enrol clinical trial . Patients tumor score negative bioassay consider screening failure enrol clinical trial . 7 . Participant must either neuropathy ( sensory motor ) neuropathy less equal Grade 1 . 8 . The participant must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) score 0 2 screening . 9 . The Participant must life expectancy great 12 week . 10 . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 Platelets ≥ 100,000/ mm3 Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL equivalent Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) , unless know Gilbert 's Syndrome diagnose AST ( aspartate aminotransferase ) ( SGOT ) /ALT ( alanine aminotransferase ) ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN ( ≤ 5 × ULN liver metastasis ) Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 Amylase Lipase &lt; ULN 11 . Female participant childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test screen negative ( serum urine ) pregnancy test within 72 hour first studydrug dose . If urine test positive confirm negative , serum pregnancy test require . The serum pregnancy test must negative Participant eligible . 12 . Female participant childbearing potential ensure use highly effective method birth control define Investigator , example , result low failure rate ( i.e. , less 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly implant , injectable , combined oral contraceptive , intrauterine device ( IUDs ) , sexual abstinence vasectomize partner study period least 4 month follow last dose drug administer study . A participant exclude study one follow reason : 1 . Patients tumor score negative vitro organoid bioassay exclude . 2 . Patients nonmeasurable disease &lt; 10 mm multiparametric MRI CT scan exclude . 3 . Participants undergo primary debulking surgery prior receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy exclude . 4 . Participants secondary malignancy progress require active treatment . Participants basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin situ cervical cancer undergone potentially curative treatment exclude . 5 . Participants history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition birinapant constituent . 6 . Participants require use antitumor necrosis factor ( antiTNF ) therapy , infliximab , receive treatment antiTNF therapy within 5 halflives drug . 7 . Participants uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , symptomatic congestive heart failure , hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , autoimmune disease inflammatory disease , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 8 . Pregnant woman woman expect conceive child exclude study birinapant agent unknown potential teratogenic abortifacient effect human . Because unknown risk adverse event ( AEs ) nursing infant secondary treatment mother birinapant , breastfeed discontinue mother treat study . 9 . Participants know active infection require systemic therapy , include HIV , hepatitis B , hepatitis C. 10 . Participants history cranial nerve palsy . 11 . Participant immediate family member ( e.g. , spouse , parent/legal guardian , sibling child ) investigational site sponsor staff directly involve trial , unless prospective IRB approval ( chair designee ) grant allow exception criterion specific subject . 12 . In opinion Investigator , participant unsuitable candidate study . 13 . Patients take anticipate take maintenance therapy actively treat protocol follow protocol exclude . An example would maintenance therapy poly ADP ( adenosine diphosphate ) ribose polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitor Olaparib .</criteria>
