	<brief_title>Enhancing Laparoscopic Skill Acquisition Retention With Transcranial Direct-current Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Recent change medical training environment result many trainee lack sufficient opportunity acquire specific skill necessary specialty . New method enhance acquisition retention medical surgical skill require ensure quality future physician workforce . Transcranial direct-current stimulation ( tDCS ) emerge method non-invasive brain stimulation show safely enhance motor learn adult child . Even modest enhancement acquisition retention medical-surgical skill tDCS carry potential accelerate skill train health care provider , thereby contribute great training efficiency improve patient outcomes . Objectives : The objective study ass whether tDCS enhance acquisition retention laparoscopic surgical ability . Ethics : This study approval University Calgary Research Ethics Board Design : Randomized , double blind , sham-controlled trial evaluate ability tDCS enhance learn retention laparoscopic skill . Transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation : The tDCS method use base best-available evidence practice , apply standardized fashion experience investigator . Anodal tDCS deliver saline-soaked sponge electrode use NeuroConn Direct-Current Stimulator ( NeuroConn , Ilmenau , Germany ) . The anode center 2cm posterior leave primary motor cortex ( localize use 10-20 EEG System ) , cathode contralateral supraorbital area . Both anodal sham tDCS group current ramp 1milliamp 30 second . In anodal tDCS group , current hold 20 minute . In sham tDCS condition , current hold 60 second ( change cortical excitability ) follow 30 second ramp-down . Participants : Medical student ( year 1-3 ) general surgery resident ( Post-Graduate Year 1-5 ) Cumming School Medicine ( University Calgary ) recruit . To ensure comparable baseline skill , trainee exclude undergone formal laparoscopic training past 3 month ( medical student ) . Sample size calculation base performance measure pattern cut score , determine pilot study ( discuss ) . Based two-fold great improvement score post-training , power 90 % type-1 error 0.05 , investigator estimate sample size minimum 48 participant ( n=24 per stimulation condition , equal number resident medical student per arm ) . Study Design : A short questionnaire complete determine demographic characteristic , include : gender , age , level training , date last complete Fundamentals Laparoscopic Surgery course ( applicable ) , many time participant perform laparoscopic surgery patient , many time participant perform laparoscopic task laparoscopic simulator , often participants play video game , often participants play musical instrument . Participants recruit Advanced Technical Skills Simulation Laboratory ( University Calgary ) orient workspace . Participants complete laparoscopic task training laparoscopic box trainer ( Fundamentals Laparoscopic Surgery Trainer System , Limbs &amp; Things Inc , Georgia , USA ) consist optic camera , laparoscopic instrument , monitor display field view . The optic camera view record retroactive scoring . Participants view standardize laparoscopic training video , create expert laparoscopic surgery , demonstrate two Fundamentals Laparoscopic Surgery ( FLS ) task perform use simulator : peg-transfer ( A ) pattern cut task ( B ) . The peg-transfer task require use two dissectors transfer six ring peg opposite end pegboard , back original location . The pattern-cutting task involve 10x10cm piece gauze 4cm-diameter circle pre-drawn middle place center work-board . Participants require use dissector endoscopic scissors cut marked circle , free surround unmarked gauze . A time score calculate subtract completion time second task cut-off time 300 second . An error score calculate task either : percentage peg could transfer due drop outside field view ( i.e . 1 6 peg lose = 17 second penalty ) , percentage area deviation cut perfect circle . A total score calculate subtract error score time score . These two FLS task represent skill require bimanual ( peg-transfer ) unimanual ( pattern cut ) ability . Furthermore , two task choose score correlate train level , predictive intraoperative performance . Participants complete task A follow task B , establish baseline skill . Tasks record score retroactively , blind group allocation , quantify time error score . Participants computer randomize receive sham active tDCS . Participants perform two FLS task interleave manner ( ABAB ) , paradigm suggest enhance laparoscopic skill acquisition , eight training repetition task . Following final training block , tDCS electrode remove , final task evaluation perform task A B . The Purdue Pegboard Test ( PPT ) perform baseline post-training examine unilateral hand function , serve safety measure . Six week follow training participant return assess retention laparoscopic skill , single repetition task A B . Emerging evidence suggest significant decay laparoscopic skill present six week follow training . The amount laparoscopic practice train day follow-up factored resident , ensure standard training remain uninterrupted . Data Analysis : Mean change outcome baseline post-training follow-up compare tDCS sham ( two-way repeated-measure ANOVA factor `` stimulation type '' `` evaluation time point '' ) . Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA factor `` stimulation type '' `` training block '' explore interaction tDCS train without feedback outcome . Any decay PPT score either sham anodal tDCS group evaluate use paired-tDCS . Medical student specialty resident evaluate independently . Level train resident factor retroactively analysis .</detailed_description>
