	<detailed_description>Primary endpoint : Resolution acute exacerbation finding relate Behced Disease base achievement follow item without deterioration day 30 : For patient parenchymal neurologic disease : Resolution acute exacerbation parenchymal neurologic finding base improvement follow item without deterioration Day 30 : - Improvement muscle strength , ataxia , relevant neurologic finding depend involved region neurological examination ( Neuro Behced Disease Score , Modified Expanded Disability Status Scale , Modified Rankin Scores ) cerebrospinal fluid - Improvement systemic inflammatory finding ( CRP , Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate , SAA ) - Any decrease size MRI lesion , disappearance contrast enhancement - Improvement patient ' physician global assessment use 10-cm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) Complete response define full clinical recovery pre-attack state , disappearance MRI lesion ( ) , normalisation Cerebrospinal Fluid finding . Partial response define partial improvement clinical finding , finding still bad pre-attack state , MRI lesion , become small less enhancement , decrease cerebrospinal fluid cell count . Non-response defined improvement clinical finding , change MRI , change cerebrospinal fluid parameter , worsen finding . For patient large vessel vascular disease : Resolution acute vascular exacerbation finding relate Behced Disease base achievement follow item without deterioration 1 month : - Improvement relevant symptom ( localised pain , abdominal pain , calf thickness , haemoptysis ) use physician patient 's global assessment VAS - Improvement systemic inflammatory finding ( CRP , ESR , SAA ) - Any improvement radiological finding depend involve vessel ( MR , CT Doppler finding ) - Improvement patient ' physician global assessment use 10-cm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) Complete response define clinical laboratory improvement base ≥50 % improvement patient 's physician 's global assessment use VAS , ≥50 % reduction CRP value ; along stable ≥20 % reduce aneurysm size patient arterial involvement , stable ≥20 % reduce calf swell patient low extremity venous thrombosis . Partial response define clinical laboratory improvement base observation improvement 20-49 % accord patient 's physician 's global assessment use VAS , 20-49 % reduction CRP value ; along stable less 20 % reduce aneurysm size patient arterial involvement , stable less 20 % reduce calf swell patient low extremity thrombosis . Non-response define observe less 20 % clinical improvement patient 's physician 's global VAS worsen clinical finding , change increase acute phase response , increase aneurysm size patient arterial involvement progression venous thrombosis patient venous involvement .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients age 1860 Behced Disease fulfil International Study Group ( ISG ) criterion , recent exacerbation largevessel vascular disease and/or parenchymal neurologic disease For Neurologic Involvement Patients experience acute exacerbation parenchymal neurologic disease involve brainstem and/or diencephalic region . Exacerbation define base presence follow : An acute/subacute neurological syndrome include hemiparesis , ataxia , dysarthria , headache within first month onset neurologic manifestation ( without prior high dose steroid treatment ) Compatible cranial MRI lesion involve brainstem and/or diencephalic region For Vascular Disease : Patients experience acute exacerbation vascular disease within last month , involve Large artery ( abdominal aorta , pulmonary artery , extremity artery ) Large vein ( deep vein thrombosis extremity , caval vein thrombosis , dural sinus thrombosis ) Compatible radiological finding ( spiral CT , MR , Doppler ultrasonography ) For Neurologic Involvement : Presence severe neurological sequela previous attack render patient dependent others physically mentally Any neurological cause underlying picture include ischemic central nervous system lesion MRI Any previous treatment biological agent interferonalpha previous treatment cyclophosphamide No interferon last 6 month , Intra Venous Metilprednizolon past month For Vascular disease general : Presence severe vascular sequela previous attack render patient dependent others Any vascular disease complication evaluation exacerbation Any previous treatment biological agent interferon alpha , previous treatment cyclophosphamide No interferon alpha last 6 month , IVMP past month History Squamo Cell Carcinoma OR Basal Cell Carcinoma previous 5 year . General Presence history inflammatory rheumatic disease Positive Purified Protein Derivative test ( accord local guidance ) active Tuberculosis infection exclude via Quantiferon ( TSpot radiographic image need ) Pregnancy lactation Presence active chronic infection major episode infection require hospitalization treatment i.v . antibiotic within 30 day oral antibiotic within 14 day prior screen History malignancy within last 5 year , except successfully excise squamous basal cell carcinoma skin Women childbearing potential use contraception method ( ) specify study , well woman breastfeed With know sensitivity canakinumab Use investigational agent last 30 day</criteria>
