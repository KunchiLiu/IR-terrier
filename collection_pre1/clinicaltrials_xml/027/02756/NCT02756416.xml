	<brief_summary>This study aim quantify perfusion , assess arterial vasoconstriction , confirm reversibility use 3T ASL-MRI MRA 10 patient suspected RCVS . Acquiring data multiple time point RCVS progression , investigator assess relationship vasoconstriction downstream perfusion determine role image technique early accurate diagnosis RCVS . The investigator also aim investigate whether early imaging abnormality predict RCVS complication clinical outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome ( RCVS ) group condition characterise prolong reversible multifocal narrow cerebral artery . It present typically acute severe headache , usually recurrent thunderclap character , without additional symptom sign . Adverse complication associate RCVS devastate especially recognise early ; depend degree vasoconstriction , RCVS may associate cortical subarachnoid haemorrhage ( approximately 34 % patient ) , ischaemic infarction ( 6-39 % patient ) , concomitant posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES , 9-38 % patient ) . RCVS may also present parenchymal brain haemorrhage 20 % case . The data complication rate highlight uncertainty condition indicate need research well characterise evolution pathology ; hence need study prospective longitudinal . The hallmark RCVS vasoconstriction see vascular imaging scan typically reverse within 3 month . Prevalence radiological vasoconstriction see magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) RCVS report 60-90 % typically appear diffuse segmental constriction large medium size vessel last 4-12 week . The main advantage MRA perform without use radioactive tracer , thus provide safe method repeat observation vascular pathology . Imaging often negative first 4-5 day follow onset headache ; The mean time detect abnormality vascular imaging report 8 day headache onset . RCVS symptom usually resolve 1 month presentation , however adverse complication associate RCVS may last consequence describe . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) excellent tool characterise brain change progression resolution RCVS . Standard structural image identify complication RCVS , bleeding , ischaemia , PRES . Finally , Arterial Spin Labeling ( ASL ) MRI use non-invasively quantify perfusion brain tissue , provide measure impact upstream arterial vasoconstriction local cortical region . Cortical perfusion yet extensively studied RCVS ; time writing , two case report publish . Rosenbloom Singhal report case RCVS induce carotid endarterectomy follow frontal lobe ischaemic stroke . Perfusion MRI show unilateral hypo-perfusion , mainly affect internal watershed area superficial cortical region relatively spar . In second study , ASL-MRI perform 50-year-old man RCVS present severe recurrent headache neurological deficit ( localise right hemisphere ) . ASL-MRI demonstrate significant hypo-perfusion right parieto-occipital lobe , infarct see diffusion image . At 12 week , complete resolution cerebral vasoconstriction angiography normal perfusion finding ASL-MRI . These case study suggest perfusion MRI offer additional tool confirm understand RCVS . ASL-MRI non-invasive , radiation contrast-free technique perform multiple time point monitor change perfusion time period RCVS resolution ass response potential therapeutic . One disadvantage ASL-MRI low signal noise ratio , address use high-field MRI 3 Tesla ( 3T ) . In addition , 3T MRI provide good spatial resolution . The University Nottingham represent one lead international research centre experience use high ultra-high field MRI investigate different neurological disease multiple sclerosis brain tumour excellent result . Applying advance non-invasive MRI technique study significant advantage investigate RCVS , understand pathophysiology , ass brain perfusion multiple time point .</detailed_description>
