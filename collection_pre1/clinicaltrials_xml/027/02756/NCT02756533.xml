	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) characterize non-reversible chronic airway obstruction associate co-morbidities third lead cause death worldwide . Its evolution punctuate successive exacerbation precipitate progression disease co-morbidities . The severe exacerbation source frequent hospitalization strongly affect patient 's quality life associate increased mortality . The diagnosis exacerbation mainly clinical patient frequently consult doctor late may lead delay care . However , early detection management exacerbation reduce impact particular avoid hospitalization shorten duration . In France , long term Non-Invasive Ventilation ( NIV ) widely use treatment modality COPD patient chronic alveolar hypoventilation frequent exacerbation . In France , 7000-10000 COPD patient currently treat NIV . Recent NIV respirator fit embedded software provide detail treatment adherence ( daily use , number sessions/day , number day use give period etc ) number ventilatory parameter measure treatment ( minute ventilation , tidal volume , respiratory rate , leak , cycle trigger patient , etc. ) . In preliminary study , include 60 COPD patient treat NIV , investigator demonstrate analysis parameter software embed NIV device reliably predict occurrence exacerbation follow five day . The investigator hypothesize daily transmission via telemonitoring platform ventilation parameter patient , together ad hoc warn system , would reduce rate hospitalization COPD patient treat home NIV thanks early detection early treatment exacerbation . The physiological symptomatic change accompany exacerbation detect daily questionnaire , monitor device worn patient easy use appliance ( respiratory rate sensor , touch pad daily symptom ) . These expensive device require active patient involvement certain degree skill patient , limit use . The main innovation project patient already NIV treatment reimburse health insurance action require part patient detect worsen . Changes record ventilator setting trigger alert need early appropriate patient care initiate . Main objective : The purpose study compare program telemonitoring use parameter store NIV impact rate hospitalization worsen cardiorespiratory symptom COPD patient versus standard care one year period .</detailed_description>
