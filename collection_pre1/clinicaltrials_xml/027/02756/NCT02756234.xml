	<brief_title>Implementing Myocardial Computed Tomographic Perfusion Community Hospital Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , observational study design include convenience sample qualify patient undergo myocardial CTP . The study enroll patient undergone clinically indicate CCTA suspicion coronary artery disease suspect coronary stenosis ≥50 % -69 % examination . CCTA clinically indicate standard care procedure Lancaster General Hospital . This pilot study enroll convenience sample fifteen ( 15 ) patient Lancaster General Hospital satisfy study criterion . When patient coronary CTA , physician co-investigators , certify Certification Board Cardiovascular Computed Tomography credentialed Johns Hopkins CTP , evaluate scan presence lesion would qualify patient inclusion . Patients lesions 50 % 70 % approached participation CTP study ( 37 ) . Those agree participate schedule CTP perform within thirty ( 30 ) day initial Coronary CTA procedure . The CTP procedure involve infusion stress agent contrast bolus prior image acquisition . The CTP examination grade use standard 17-segment myocardial model recommend ACCF/AHA nuclear myocardial perfusion stress echocardiography , comparison myocardial appearance baseline coronary CTA . Areas myocardial hypo-enhancement ( decrease CT signal ) hyperemic condition ( coronary vasodilation regadenoson infusion ) indicate possible ischemia . If coronary stenosis severe enough reduce myocardial perfusion , study show invasive therapy include revascularization offer benefit patient . Use CTP may allow investigator determine , improve accuracy , patient hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis . These result report patient ' treat physician may use treatment planning .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Index CCTA . The patient must CCTA do clinical indication within 2 week prior consent/enrollment , order The Heart Group Lancaster General Health . Age great 18 year . Lesion ( ) require test . Upon review coronary CT angiogram , interpret physician ( trained Johns Hopkins course CTP imaging ) find least one lesion could benefit evaluation , specifically least one stenosis 50 % 70 % , lesion unclear stenosis severity suspect 50 % 70 % . Referring physician agreement . The refer physician contact agree patient approached consent . Informed consent . The patient willing able provide inform consent . CCTA complication . After observation period least 20 minute index CCTA , evidence MACE , allergy , untoward clinical event reduces CTP safety suitability ( define attend physician ) exclude patient eligibility . Contraindication regadenosen accord LGH protocol ( addendum 2 ) . Medical record acute ischemia evidence ECG positive cardiac biomarkers interim CCTA CTP . Electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia include acute STEMI ( ST elevation equal great 1mm two lead ) , ST segment depression and/or T wave inversion ( know old thought evidence ongoing ischemia ) . Positive cardiac biomarkers include elevated troponin , myoglobin , and/or creatinine phosphokinase MB fraction ) . History asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease require bronchodilator steroid therapy within past 3 month . Inability tolerate beta blocker . Atrioventricular block ( Type IIIII ) , prolong QT interval sick sinus syndrome . Renal insufficiency ( creatinine ≥1.6 and/or , GFR &lt; 60 ml/m ) renal failure require dialysis . Atrial fibrillation markedly irregular rhythm . Psychological unsuitability extreme claustrophobia . Pregnancy unknown pregnancy status . Clinical instability deem attending physician ; include limited : cardiogenic shock , hypotension ( systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg ) , refractory hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg ) , sustain ventricular atrial arrhythmia require intravenous medication . Use Viagra Cialis past 24 hour . Known history allergy adverse reaction xray dye , regadenoson aminophylline . Use caffeine within previous 12 hour ( inactivates regadenoson ) . History severe aortic stenosis .</criteria>
