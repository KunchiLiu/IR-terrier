	<brief_title>MEK162 Combination With Capecitabine Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biliary tract cancer one rare cancer , relatively frequent east Asia . The frequency KRAS mutation and/or BRAF mutation report 40 60 % . The prognosis still poor , limited treatment option . The commonly use 1st-line chemotherapy gemcitabine+cisplatin combination . In gemcitabine-pretreated advanced biliary tract cancer , fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy use . However , overall survival cytotoxic chemotherapy still 8-10 month , call urgent development efficient treatment option . Recently , mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulate kinase kinase ( MEK ) inhibition show antitumor effect KRAS mutate biliary tract cancer preclinical model . In phase II study MEK inhibitor ( selumetinib ) metastatic biliary tract cancer , selumetinib display interesting activity acceptable tolerability . MEK162 oral , highly selective MEK inhibitor . It show promote apoptosis vivo antitumor activity human biliary tract cancer cell line . So far , study test MEK inhibitor mainly gemcitabine-pretreated advanced biliary tract cancer , especially combination capecitabine chemotherapy . The aim study test efficacy MEK162 plus capecitabine gemcitabine-pretreated advanced biliary tract cancer , explore predictive biomarkers future large-scale clinical trial use combination .</detailed_description>
