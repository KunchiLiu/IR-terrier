	<brief_summary>With age population , total knee arthroplasty perform increase frequency . Although surgery successful general , significant number patient suffers persistent pain disability . Traditional risk assessment tool focus single organ system . Our investigator find mobility , assess Mobility Assessment Tool short form ( MAT-sf ) , simple accurate method predict postoperative outcome , include length stay , postoperative complication , nurse home placement old patient . Prehabilitation process enhance person 's functional capacity withstand incoming stressor . Although multiple study test prehabilitation joint replacement surgery , result mix . The investigator hypothesize patient limited mobility likely benefit prehabilitation . The investigator plan use individualized aquatic exercise prehabilitation tool enhance compliance ; resistance water strengthen muscle increase energy expenditure ; buoyancy water provide environment joint weight bear . The aim study : 1 ) To evaluate feasibility prehabilitation use 6-8 week aquatic exercise 40 geriatric patient schedule total knee arthroplasty osteoarthritis ; 2 ) To examine effect 6-8 week aquatic exercise mobility , pain , stiffness , physical function , cognitive function depression ; inflammatory marker 3 ) To estimate effect prehabilitation postoperative outcome . The investigator plan enroll 40 patient age &gt; 50 , schedule elective primary total knee replacement . Investigators screen patient Preoperative Assessment Clinic enroll patient decreased mobility , measure MAT-sf . Patients randomize either prehabilitation group usual care group . All participant undergo extensive assessment pain , stiffness , physical function , depression , balance cognitive function use Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) , expand Short Physical Performance Battery ( eSPPB ) , Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) . Serum inflammatory marker assess baseline . The prehabilitation group undergo 6-8 week individualize aquatic exercise heat pool ( 60 min/session , 3 time per week ) . Aquatic equipment maybe use challenge balance trunk stabilization . All participant reassess immediately surgery 4 week surgery use WOMAC , eSPPB , MoCA MAT-sf . Serum inflammatory marker body composition reassess time point . The primary outcome interest postoperative complication , length stay , Intensive Care Unit length stay , institutionalization . If successful , investigator sound pilot data several critical health outcome support external proposal larger-scale study .</brief_summary>
