	<brief_title>Impact Telemonitoring Improve Adherence Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) -Treated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction CPAP ( continuous positive airway pressure ) frequently use effective treatment obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) . It proven offer survival benefit patient severe disease , improve sleep quality , health-related quality life decrease cardiovascular event , stroke myocardial infarction . The challenge treatment remain obtain adequate adherence , define use least 4 hours/night 70 % night . Independently usually accept cut-off , CPAP effect grows increase use . A recent randomise study cohort 3100 CPAP-treated patient , randomise intensive versus standard intervention , also confirm positive effect great CPAP use ( 6.9 vs 5.2 h/night ) cardiovascular outcome , indicate regular 5-6 hour use/night require . Improvement adherence obtain supportive , educational behavioural therapy . CPAP specific education nowadays routinely apply center . Telemonitoring also show improve adherence . Other study add telemonitoring vs. placebo usual care 45 recently diagnose OSA patient observe 46 % adherence improvement telemonitoring group 2 month . In another randomised trial , daily download CPAP data consecutive phone-call intervention usual care 75 OSAS patient . After 3 month , mean adherence 321 min telemonitoring arm versus 207 min standard arm day use . T4P® telemonitoring unit add CPAP device allow obtain daily report usage duration , mask leak , pressure apnea-hypopnea index . Data anonymously transmit secure server analyse dedicate web portal . The purpose present study assess impact telemonitoring delay first technical intervention CPAP titration night CPAP-treated OSAS patient manage sleep unit . The shortening delay could help improve adherence first week treatment . As secondary aim , investigator would like assess impact telemonitoring mean adherence first 3 month treatment , crucial period . Material method Consecutive OSAS patient admit sleep unit CPAP titration night screen . If patient accept participate study , randomise standard care telemonitoring CPAP follow-up . Standard care After CPAP titration night , patient instruct use device night whole night . They receive write instruction reach sleep unit ( phone call , visit ) often need , week day , order resolve intercurrent problem interfere CPAP use . A group educational session CPAP-treated patient schedule 1 month visit pneumologist schedule 1.5 month . Telemonitoring follow-up In addition standard care , T4P® add CPAP patient home . Sleep lab technical staff instruct connect web portal analyse patient 's data Tuesdays Fridays . In case air leak , persistant significant apnea-hypopnea index , use &lt; 3h three consecutive day , investigator call patient eventually ask visit staff sleep lab . Outcomes - delay CPAP titration night first intervention ( phone call/visit ) - mean CPAP adherence measure first 3 month treatment</detailed_description>
