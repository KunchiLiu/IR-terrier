	<brief_title>Evaluation Novartis Access ; Non-communicable Disease ( NCD ) Access Initiative</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants , intervention , outcome : Eight county non-randomly select inclusion study . Initially , Novartis Access medicine sell solely Mission Essential Drugs Supplies ( MEDS ) , main supplier large network private ( often faith-based ) non-profit health facility country , also key supplier public facility several county . Of 47 total county Kenya , 17 county exclude purchase medicine MEDS , additional 15 county exclude purchase least 10 million KES worth medicine MEDS previous year . Three county exclude due security concern , four additional county exclude eliminate share border final sample , minimize risk contamination intervention control county . When consider county share border , low volume MEDS purchase previous year exclude . In Kenya , NCD service provide public private non-profit sector level 2 dispensary level 6 hospital . Not county level 6 hospital , reason exclude study . Counties average : five public private non-profit level 5 county referral hospital ; three public level 4 sub-county hospital ; 15 public private non-profit level 3 health center ; 85 public private non-profit level 2 dispensary . All 184 eligible level 3-5 facility include study , 200 level 2 dispensary randomly select inclusion . For facility include study , one private drug seller identify main alternative facility identify include . Private drug seller include pharmacy , drug store , dispense doctor . A total sample 800 household randomly select eight study county ( 400 Novartis Access county ; 400 control county ) use two-stage sampling procedure . In first stage , 10 enumeration area ( EAs ) select county probability proportional size base data recent census . Then , second stage , 10 eligible household randomly select EA recruit study . All household EA list random order , enumerator proceed list 10 eligible household identify . Households eligible least one member least 18 year old previously diagnose prescribed medicine NCDs address Novartis Access , include diabetes , hypertension , breast cancer , asthma . All member household fit criterion recruit study . Based prevalence relevant NCD condition Kenya , 20 % household meet inclusion criterion . In intervention county , public private non-profit health facility allow purchase subsidize Novartis Access NCD medicine MEDS . The Novartis Access portfolio include 15 medicine treat diabetes , hypertension , breast cancer , asthma . While portfolio include patented medicine usually market sell Novartis brand generic Sandoz brand , medicine sell initiative package new Novartis Access brand . The medicine sell directly MEDS average cost 150 Kenyan Shillings ( KES ) , around US $ 1.50 , per monthly dose . Facility-level administrative data NCD medicine purchase obtain MEDS use monitor implementation intervention . The primary outcome interest medicine availability price health facility , medicine availability , price , expenditures patient ' household . Availability facility define proportion Novartis Access medicine equivalent stock day data collection . Availability household define proportion prescribed Novartis Access medicine equivalent home day data collection . The price NCD medicine sell private for-profit drug seller important secondary outcome . Patient perception NCD medicine access also explore . Data collect facility household use structured questionnaire baseline prior implementation Novartis Access , midline one year , end line two year . At interview , subsample facility household also administer qualitative interview . Additional data collect quarterly facility randomly select subsample household use structured questionnaire administer phone . The study power detect 10 percentage point increase household availability medicine due Novartis Access Î± = 0.05 , assume intracluster correlation coefficient 0.05 , 10 % loss follow-up , proportion available control group 33 % . Assignment intervention : In Kenya , county health office responsible bulk purchasing medicine health facility , allow random allocation Novartis Access county-level . The eight county select inclusion trial randomize intervention control group use covariate constrain randomization method maximize balance nine demographic health variable : total population ; population density ; proportion population urban area ; poverty rate ; number health facility ; physician per caput ; health spending per caput ; overall value order MEDS previous year ; proportion value order MEDS previous year private non-profit versus public health facility . Allocation mask data collector . However , possible mask intervention participant . Data collection , management , analysis : Data collect health facility households baseline , midline , end line use structured questionnaire . The health facility questionnaire adapt instrument develop World Health Organization Health Action International previously use Kenya , capture information medicine availability medicine price . The household questionnaire include information demographic , household asset , key information medicine , include whether prescribed NCD medicine currently home , location medicine often purchase , price pay , overall household expenditure medicine ( good ) . A subsample health facility subsample household also administer qualitative interview baseline , midline , end line visit . A purposeful subsample five level 2 dispensary five level 3-5 facility select county ( 80 facility total ) , one staff member randomly select interview . A purposeful subsample 10 household county ( 80 household total ) select qualitative interview , administer one individual household also complete general household survey . Facilities household select qualitative interview maximize variation viewpoint represent . The qualitative instrument design explore depth key issue relate medicine access . Surveillance data collect quarterly health facility subsample household . For health facility surveillance , shorten version structure questionnaire basic information medicine availability price administer phone month rotate one-third sample health facility , facility surveilled per quarter . For household surveillance , random sample half study household select ; half study household surveilled , allow analysis potential effect surveillance household behavior . Those household select surveillance administer shortened version structure questionnaire basic information medicine availability price phone . As health facility , rotate one-third sample household select surveillance survey phone month , surveilled household survey per quarter . A 5 % subsample surveilled health facility households visit person audit phone response . Innovations Poverty Action ( IPA ) partner study manage research fieldwork . IPA specialize design implementation randomize controlled trial test policy intervention develop country setting , partner several rigorous evaluation Kenya recent year . Data collect electronically use SurveyCTO software tablet manage use Microsoft Access software . Data baseline characteristic health facility household compare across group assess balance . Impacts Novartis Access estimate use intention treat analysis . Analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) method use control potential baseline difference group . All analysis conduct use Stata statistical software .</detailed_description>
