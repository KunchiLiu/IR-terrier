	<brief_summary>The purpose study collect information prostate tissue biopsy collect ClariCore System radical prostatectomy procedure . The ClariCore System design improve biopsy take prostate use light sensor ( fiber optic ) see change tissue . The information collect study use develop method tell difference normal suspicious tissue help guide physician biopsy procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ClariCoreâ„¢ Biopsy System Patients Undergoing Radical Retropubic Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objective study acquire analyze spectral data correlative tissue biopsy core use ClariCore System purpose algorithm development . The system algorithm train identify real-time vivo 'Normal ' versus 'Suspicious ' prostate tissue . The 'Normal ' 'Suspicious ' assignment base optical signal principle component parameter measure signal compare threshold derive pathologically know value suspicious ( possibly cancerous ) normal ( non-cancerous ) measurement prostate tissue .</detailed_description>
