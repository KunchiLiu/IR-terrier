	<brief_summary>Previous multi-dose Phase I Phase II clinical study demonstrate Instiladrin safe effective treatment BCG-refractory recurrent NMIBC . This Phase III study design expand observation use high dose Instiladrin patient `` BCG Unresponsive '' refer patient high grade NMIBC unlikely benefit receive intravesical BCG .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate INSTILADRIN® Patients With High Grade , Bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) Unresponsive NMIBC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recombinant IFN alpha2b pleiotropic effect contribute antitumor activity Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer ( NMIBC ) . Instiladrin ( rAd-IFN/Syn3 ) non-replicating adenovirus vector harbor human IFN alpha2b gene . When combined excipient Syn3 , intravesical administration rAd-IFN result transduction virus epithelial cell line bladder . The IFN alpha2b gene incorporate cellular DNA result synthesis expression large amount IFN alpha2b protein . Clinical study confirm IFN alpha2b protein measure patient treat Instiladrin within 24 hour dose .</detailed_description>
