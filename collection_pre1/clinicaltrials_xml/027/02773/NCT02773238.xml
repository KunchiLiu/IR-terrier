	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) single positron emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) /CT image work improve radiation therapy treatment patient stage IIB-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer . PET/CT image mid-way treatment may able accurately show well radiation therapy chemotherapy work . SPECT/CT imaging may able tell part lung tissue healthier others . Based result imaging , treatment adjustment may make radiation therapy improve survival decrease toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To test superiority 2 year ( yr ) overall survival ( OS ) functional lung avoidance response-adaptive dose escalation ( FLARE ) radiation therapy ( RT ) patient cohort 60 gray ( Gy ) cohort Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) 0617 ( 57 % 2yr OS ) historical control . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : I . Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v ) 4 grade 2 high pneumonitis incidence FLARE RT compare historical control ( non-inferiority test ) . II . 1 yr local control , progression-free survival , pulmonary function test decline . III . Identification baseline fludeoxyglucose ( FDG ) PET/CT mid-treatment FDG PET/CT image biomarkers predict patient survival . IV . Identification baseline perfusion SPECT/CT image biomarkers predict grade ( G ) 2+ pneumonitis pulmonary function test ( PFT ) decline . V. Collection plasma urine sample future correlative study image biomarkers cytokine biomarkers radiation response tumor normal tissue . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study radiation therapy . Patients undergo functional avoidance radiation therapy week 1-3 . Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F-18 FDG PET/CT baseline , 3 week , 3 month post-radiation therapy undergo technetium Tc-99m albumin aggregate ( 99mTc-MAA ) technetium Tc-99m DTPA ( 99mTc-DTPA ) SPECT/CT radiation therapy baseline 3 month post-radiation therapy . Baseline PET/CT must perform University Washington Medical Center/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance within one month treatment start , therefore patient may need repeat baseline PET/CT PET/CT outside institution &gt; 1 month old . Patients respond treatment 3 week , receive increase daily radiation therapy dosage . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
