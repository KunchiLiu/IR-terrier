	<detailed_description>Procedure The DBS lead stereotactically introduce target brain ( AIC ) fix skull ; lead connect neurostimulator implant subcutaneously subclavicular region . This perform neurosurgeon skilled technique , procedure routinely perform patient disease ( use brain target ) . Sample Size : There minimum number maximum , expect far less 100 . Patients meet inclusion criterion obtain insurance coverage candidate procedure . As study efficacy , statistical analysis perform . IRB approval require per FDA stipulation . Recruitment : Patients medically refractory OCD least 5 year , fail 3 SSRIs , meet criterion indication contraindicate , attempt recruit , least learn information procedure , use flyer . These flyer attempt catch attention subject may candidate , may benefit procedure ; detail clinic visit would know meet criterion . The flyer include attachment , display contact information . They post line , free advertising bulletin board , UT Psychiatry Clinic building , Baylor Psychiatry Clinic building , within UT Baylor school Medicine , private OCD support group . Course Study Patients enrol meet necessary requirements/indications insurance coverage system implant . Aside criterion , specific population target else exclude recruitment . They sign informed consent form ( attach ) prior surgery agree course action . They follow clinical effect side effect routine basis follow surgery : 2 week , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 month every 6 month month , psychiatrist neurosurgeon . The known risk detail attached Summary Safety Probable Benefit document , Section VIII , well Device manual ( attach ) . All patient enrol identity safe-guarded , issue subject number , personal information keep electronically lock key permanent office . Data Safety Monitoring As procedure nearly identical routinely perform patient Parkinson 's disease ( except different patient thus different brain structure target ) , specific/independent DSMB need , none currently use need Parkinson 's patient . Risks Clinicians/Researchers There know procedure situation provide risk clinical/research staff .</detailed_description>
