	<brief_title>Chemo Alone Combination With Radiation Unresectable Cholangiocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently standard care unresectable non-metastatic cholangiocarcinoma chemotherapy median survival 11.7 month ( ABC-02 study ) . While study include almost 60 % patient cholangiocarcinomas ( intrahepatic , extra hepatic hilar ) , almost 73-76 % patient arm metastasis begin . And overall survival entire cohort significantly improve gemcitabine plus cisplatin compare cisplatin alone , hazard ratio intrahepatic { 0.57 ( 0.34-0.94 ) } , extra hepatic { 0.73 ( 0.43-1.23 ) } hilar cholangiocarcinomas { 0.59 ( 0.32-1.09 ) } insignificant . Even though concurrent chemoradiation+/= brachytherapy use management cholangiocarcinomas 3 decade lack level I evidence prevents recommend first line management across multidisciplinary clinic . While either modality alone rarely yields survival 12 month , recent report improve median survival combination high dose radiation systemic chemotherapy necessitates investigation role combination high dose ( chemo ) radiation systemic chemotherapy . All patient diagnosis nonmetastatic unresectable cholangiocarcinoma fulfill study eligibility criterion evaluate study participation . Patients undergo upfront randomization one study arm ( systemic chemotherapy alone vs Systemic chemotherapy+ High dose radiation ) The study stratification criterion do accord primary site i.e . Intrahepatic v Extrahepatic .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 year Performance Status 02 Tissue diagnosis adenocarcinoma biliary tract . Wherever tissue diagnosis feasible spite repeat attempt multidisciplinary consensus clinicoradiological diagnosis cholangiocarcinoma ( CA 199= 100mg/ml radiological evidence malignant stricture ) make patient consent available treatment without tissue diagnosis . Unresectable disease determine hepatobiliary surgical team . No evidence peritoneal distant metastasis . No radiological evidence paraaortic nodal disease . Child A Child B ( score 7 ) Ability tolerate radical treatment . Multicentric intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( however adjacent satellite lesion permit ) Inability deliver safe radiation due high tumor/ liver ratio . Active cholangitis . Expected Survival &lt; 6 month . Unresolved biliary tract obstruction . Inability deliver systemic chemotherapy ( persistent bilirubin &gt; 3 )</criteria>
