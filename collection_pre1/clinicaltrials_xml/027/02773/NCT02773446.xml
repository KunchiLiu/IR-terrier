	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safe optimal dose regimen ( fast duration ) administer challenge ETEC strain B7A , CS6 express ETEC strain . Additionally , assessment homologous protection follow rechallenge B7A assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Challenge Model Refinement With Enterotoxigenic Escherichia Coli Strain B7A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli ( ETEC ) common cause infectious diarrhea child resource limited country , also frequent cause traveler 's diarrhea civilian military traveler endemic country . ETEC strain express one two enterotoxin ( heat labile toxin ( LT ) heat stable toxin ( ST ) ) cause help bacteria cause main symptom watery diarrhea . They also express variety colonization factor ( CF ) help attach intestinal wall . Each colonization factor one surface antigens ( CS ) . Vaccines treatment prevent ETEC disease development . Some target specific enterotoxins colonization factor . For 40 year , use ETEC human challenge study understand ETEC disease process , immune response , recently , determine whether treatment vaccine protective effective mitigating disease . One concern challenge study use high dos bacteria give may overwhelm protective efficacy vaccine treatment . Several strain ETEC use challenge study ; frequently use strain B7A ( CS6+ , LT+ , ST+ . O148 : H28 ) . This study explore optimal dose strategy B7A , order minimize dose ETEC necessary produce disease healthy adult volunteer . There two inpatient admission . The first examine 4 dose fast regimen healthy volunteer . The second admission include volunteer become ill first admission , well new group volunteer . This second admission validate optimal dose first admission , well determine previous infection B7A ETEC protect new infection . Trying understand immune response challenge organism may help u optimize vaccine design delivery protect people infection .</detailed_description>
