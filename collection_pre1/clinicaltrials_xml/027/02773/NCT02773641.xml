	<brief_summary>Women provoke vestibulodynia ( PVD ) suffer severe dyspareuni often present hyperactivity pelvic floor muscle ( PFM ) maintain dyspareunia . The rationale study woman PVD n't succeed restore function PFM physiotherapy , Botulinum Toxin A ( BTA ) could optional treatment decrease high muscle tonus thus possibly reduce coital pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Botulinum Toxin A Treatment Provoked Vestibulodynia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design methodology General outline The study investigator- initiated phase III study determine effect botulinum toxin A injection bulbocavernosus muscle woman provoke vestibulodynia reduction level dyspareunia . The study double blind , placebo-controlled RCT analyze accord intention treat . The study carry accord trial protocol , current regulation ( LVFS 2011:19 , ICH GCP ) late version Helsinki declaration . Ethical approval Stockholm regional ethic committee also obtain study begin . No financial support manufacturer active drug obtain . Women PVD , age 18-40 year , inform study gynecologist via advertisement information contact research nurse responsible gynecologist information . If diagnosis PVD need clarify , screen appointment schedule . It estimate project require 4 year recruitment treatment participant , follow-up , data analysis report result . During recruitment , patient PVD ask participate epigenetic study analyze grade methylation certain candidate gene associate pain anxiety treatment `` genome wide association study '' aim find possible genetic marker PVD . If accept , venous blood sample take Visit 1 Visit 5 . These study otherwise separate RCT ethical approval . The blood sample register Stockholms Medicinska Biobank ( registreringsnummer 941 hos IVO ) store later analysis research department Dept . Obstetrics Gynecology , 182 88 Danderyd , Sweden . Visit 1 ( recruitment baseline ) If patient willing participate fulfill inclusion exclusion criterion sign inform consent presence gynecologist charge injection BTA placebo . Evaluation psycho-sexual health quality life ( QoL ) The follow validated ( include Swedish language ) questionnaires fill ; - Data general reproductive health include current medication anti-conception method - Female Sexual Function Index ( FSFI ) - Female Sexual Distress Scale ( FSDS ) - Quality life ( WHOQOL-BRIEF , Swedish version - EQ-5 - PSS ( perceived stress scale ) - Anxiety questionnaire ( Spence , Swedish version ) . Evaluation coital pain/dyspareunia - The level dyspareunia last month report baseline use VAS 0 ( pain ) 100 ( bad pain imaginable ) - Functional measure coital impairment ( Never pain , Occasional mild pain - preventing intercourse , Moderate pain - sometimes prevent intercourse , Severe pain - time prevent intercourse ) . In addition - Pain insertion normal size tampon also report accord VAS 0-100 . Vaginal pressure measurement Measurement vaginal pressure perform use thin plastic catheter small pressure transducer top ( 4 mm ) , connect manometer . The catheter place vagina , 3 -4 cm vaginal opening . Vaginal resting pressure mm Hg ( VRP ) , pelvic floor muscle ( PFM ) strength , PFM endurance 10 measure . Venous blood sample 20 ml separate genetic study Randomization The research nurse perform randomization accord computerized block-randomization prepare seal envelope contain data randomize treatment participant . She also prepare randomization list name , personal number randomization number keep lock away research department . Blinding mask The research nurse open randomization envelope prepare syringe active drug placebo accord randomization number . The syringe mark patient 's name , personal number randomization number leave tray assigned place collect insertion provider ( responsible investigator ) . Thus , double blind procedure obtain . Participation study patient 's randomization number note kept patient 's Clinical Research Format ( CRF ) . Copies randomization envelop keep lock away research department Dept . Obstetrics Gynecology , Danderyd Hospital . In case emergency individual envelope obtain time accessed investigator involve study . Thereby blind study jeopardize case emergency . Drug administration A total amount 50 Allergan-units BTA , dilute sterile NaCl solution 9 mg/ml 0 , 5 ml 0 , 5 ml sterile NaCl solution 9 mg/ml inject two occasion ( tree month apart ) 4 site ( 2 side ) m. bulbocavernosus approximately 3-4 cm vaginal opening EMG guidance use EMG needle ( 37mm x 27G , Natus Manufacturing Limited , Ireland ) . Participants without highly effective anti-conception method undergo pregnancy test randomization treatment . Highly anti-conception method define ; combine hormonal method contain estrogen progesterone ( oral , intravaginal , transdermal ) , progesterone ( oral , injectable , implantable ) , intrauterine device , intrauterine hormone-releasing system , bilateral tube occlusion , vasectomized partner , sexual abstinence . In visit , web-based diary keep report adverse event , pain sexual activity result tampon test perform week home . The research nurse send e-mails questionnaire fill follow-up visit check questionnaire complete . She also remind participant via e-mail report adverse event perform tampon test require . Visit 2 , 4-6 week baseline Evaluation report adverse event Vaginal pressure measurement Visit 3 , 12 week baseline Evaluation report adverse event Questionnaires psycho-sexual health QoL - Visit 1 Coital pain tampon test ( VAS 0-100 ) functional measure coital impairment Vaginal pressure measurement Pregnancy test participant without highly effective anti-conception method The patient treat treatment randomize baseline ( either 50 Allergan-units BTA ( 0.5 ml ) 0.5 ml placebo ) inject manner . Visit 4 , 16-18 week baseline Evaluation report adverse event Vaginal pressure measurement Visit 5 , 24 week baseline Evaluation report adverse event Questionnaires psycho-sexual health QoL - Visit 1 Coital pain tampon test ( VAS 0-100 ) functional measure coital impairment Vaginal pressure measurement Venous blood sample 20 ml separate genetic study At point patient offer , need , information conventional treatment PVD exercise desensitize vestibular mucosa exercise pelvic floor muscle rehabilitation . Visit 6 , 12 month baseline Questionnaires psycho-sexual health QoL - Visit 1 Coital pain tampon test ( VAS 0-100 ) , functional measure coital impairment Vaginal pressure measurement End Trial The trial complete last patient come Visit 6 . After trial complete , participant receive placebo offer treatment Botox injection , administer way study , result show Botox effective placebo PVD serious adverse event occur trial . For post-trial treatment , patient pay medication . The treatment otherwise free charge . No treatment PVD plan carry participant resume contact ordinary open care gynecologist need trial complete .</detailed_description>
