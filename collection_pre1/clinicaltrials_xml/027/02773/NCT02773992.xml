	<brief_summary>Medical The Internet Things ( IoT ) , recent breakthrough communication technology , could helpful improve health care delivery save medical cost , regard pulmonary nodule management still basic understanding . Investigators adopt `` Internet thing medical three plus two type pulmonary nodule diagnosis '' chun-xue Bai put forward , use develop mobile phone-based IoT ( mIoT ) platform initiate randomize , multicenter , control trial value clinical effectivity `` Internet thing medical three plus two type pulmonary nodule diagnosis '' management pulmonary nodule . In study , least 600 patient pulmonary nodule ( typical symptom , often single , clear boundary , increased density , soft tissue shadow surround lung parenchyma diameter ≤3 cm ) randomly allocate control group , receive routine follow-up , intervention group , receive `` Internet thing medical three plus two type pulmonary nodule diagnosis '' management . Endpoints study include : ( 1 ) The positive diagnosis rate lung cancer I stage ; ( 2 ) 5 year disease-free survival rate overall survival rate ; ( 3 ) direct medical cost per year . Results study provide direct evidence suitability `` Internet thing medical three plus two type pulmonary nodule diagnosis '' pulmonary nodule patient management .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study Three Plus Two Type Early Diagnosis Pulmonary Nodules Medical Internet Things</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The flow chart study design show Figure 1.After enrollment , participant randomly assign two group : IoT group routine management group . For group , participant gather basic information ( age , sex , smoke smoking status , family history cancer , family history lung disease , Other malignant tumor history , drug use history effect fever ) . For IoT group , `` three plus two type pulmonary nodule diagnosis '' professor Bai put forward carried participant : three basic step : ① gather information : smoking history , tumor personal family history , copd history , etc . ; ② noninvasive examination : tumor marker , lung function chest low-dose CT thin layer ; ③ information mining in-depth : software three-dimensional reconstruction pulmonary nodule , depth excavation , accurate calculation density volume , assessment surround infiltration lung nodule relate vascular growth status ; two solution : ① Pathological diagnosis highly suspected participant : fiber bronchoscope , ultrasonic bronchoscope , thoracoscope CT guide percutaneous lung biopsy , etc ; ② Close scientific follow-up person qualitative : doctor follow manage participant scientifically accordance follow-up management table Internet thing platform ( Researchkit ) . The routine management group completely manage investigator ' personal experience . Follow-up Researchkit APP base android phone system IOS system instal participant 's cellphone free participant train use software . They allow practice accurate data submission collection ascertain . At time , APP instruction also provide , one engineer ready consultation case technical problem . The following measure carry via Internet platform : ① collect basic information subject , suggest date follow-up accord subject ' nodule situation ; ② health education push subject ' mobile terminal help carry self health management ; ③ subject ask report physical condition month via Researchkit APP ; ④ communication medical staff work hour available remotely mobile device . Participant allow make unscheduled clinic visit emergency visit necessary . The study period 5 year . The outcome record superiority `` iot three plus two diagnosis method '' management pulmonary nodule evaluate .</detailed_description>
