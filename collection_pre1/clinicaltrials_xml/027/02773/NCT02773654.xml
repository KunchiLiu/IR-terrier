	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine ability mobile clinical application reliably accurately track scapular motion people asymptomatic symptomatic shoulder . The ability accurately reliably measure shoulder position clinically important first step choose best treatment technique treat shoulder movement dysfunction . Therefore , primary objective study : 1 . To determine inter- intra-rater reliability shoulder joint position measurement symptomatic asymptomatic subject , use mobile application , without use handle smartphone 2 . To determine validity shoulder joint position measurement measurement describe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mobile Application Utilization Measurement Scapular Position</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects ask provide demographic background information age , height , history pain injury , description physical activity level . Subjects receive clinical screening exam license physical therapist determine type movement abnormality present , severity symptom screen inclusion exclusion criterion . To collect scapular position measurement reliability data , subject stand data collection . Measurements scapula take mobile application arm rest two elevate position . Subjects wear off-the-shelf elbow brace ask hold arm two elevate position . These elevated position maintain subject maintain contact forearm guide . For intra-rater reliability , position measurement repeat twice three plane elevation . Additionally , inter-rater reliability measurement repeat two examiner . This process repeat twice use application without handle . For validation portion study , subgroup subject position measurement perform single examiner additional motion sensor tap skin scapula breast bone sensor attach arm brace strap arm . In total , subject ask raise hold arm approximately 5 sec , 36 time test within range motion typically perform daily activity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Asymptomatic subject : subject without complaint history shoulder pain obvious movement abnormality . 2 . Symptomatic subject : subject shoulder pain active range motion beyond 120Â° elevation . 1 . Symptomatic asymptomatic subject : history trauma include fracture , dislocation , previous shoulder surgery within past 6 week . Humeral elevation le 120 degree , shoulder symptomology judge examiner cervical origin . 2 . Asymptomatic subject : Complaints shoulder pain , positive result joint test commonly associate shoulder impingement , presence shoulder joint movement abnormality determine physical therapist , include thoracic scoliosis .</criteria>
