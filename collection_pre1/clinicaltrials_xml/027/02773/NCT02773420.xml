	<brief_summary>Purpose : The current study aim evaluate safety effectiveness HETâ„¢ Bipolar System ( Medtronic , Boulder , CO ) treatment grade I-II hemorrhoid prospective pilot study . This device evaluate retrospectively limited cohort 23 patient previously . Methods : Patients see colorectal clinic single institution grade I-II hemorrhoid offer participate prospective pilot trial . The HET device modify anoscope equip LED lighting , tissue clamp mechanism bipolar energy source use treat multiple hemorrhoidal column one sitting . Three columns hemorrhoid treat 2 heat energy application per column . The primary outcome treatment effect hemorrhoid symptom bleed , pain , prolapse , itching , soil . This measured patient complete questionnaire document symptom 's frequency 0 3 ( i.e . 0 &lt; 1x/month ; 3 daily ) therapy 3 week 6 month follow-up . Post-treatment pain score record use visual analog scale ( VAS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HET Bipolar System : Validation Outpatient Hemorrhoid Treatment Introduction : This study evaluate effectiveness treatment Grade I-II hemorrhoid novel HET Bipolar System ( Medtronic , Boulder , Co. ) . This device modify anoscope equip LED lighting , tissue clamp mechanism bipolar energy device . It insert anus direct vision target tissue proximal hemorrhoid , place within treatment window clamp . The bipolar energy device activate ligate feeding hemorrhoidal vessel , essentially disrupt blood supply hemorrhoid . The published evaluation device date retrospective analysis safety efficacy device 23 patient ( 1 ) . There prospective study device effectiveness literature . The investigator aim evaluate efficacy device , define decrease symptom and/or recurrence , Grade I-II hemorrhoid prospective study consist 30 patient . Other non invasive mean treat hemorrhoid range sclerotherapy rubber band ligation , often require multiple treatment cause discomfort . The investigator aim study HET Bipolar treatment hemorrhoid offer another validate minimally invasive option treatment symptomatic hemorrhoid outpatient set . Research Design Method : The investigator enroll total 30 subject . Participating patients,18 year age old , undergoing treatment HET bipolar system symptomatic Grade I II hemorrhoid . Please note HET bipolar system use part standard care participant receive treatment regardless research . The subject identify recruited University Illinois Chicago Department Colorectal Surgery faculty via clinic appointment Outpatient Care Center , 1801 W. Taylor St , Suite 3F , Chicago , Il 60612 . Informed consent provide clinic regard participation study . Refusal participate influence treatment option present deemed necessary subject 's condition . A pretreatment hemorrhoid symptom questionnaire complete patient . In develop questionnaire investigator examine validated hemorrhoidal symptom questionnaire literature , Sodergren Score ( 2 ) also various others ( 3 ) . The Sodergren score offer theoretical basis , however investigator choose develop questionnaire secondary need inclusion bleed symptom hemorrhoid . While subject undergo treatment , investigator record time treatment , number hemorrhoid treat , energy application timing . Immediately treatment , patient describe painful procedure use Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) . The questionnaire take 5-10 minute complete . Patients see follow outpatient clinic visit 2-3 week 8-12 week post procedure . At follow , patient give post-treatment questionnaire regard symptom hemorrhoid ( questionnaire pre-treatment questionnaire ) . The questionnaire assign five cardinal symptom hemorrhoid number 0 3 3 severe symptom . After tally five symptom score , total 0 ( symptom ) 15 ( severe symptom ) assign patient 's overall symptom . In addition , patient give journal record daily pain 14 consecutive day , day 21 day 56 use Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) . This accurately record pain , questionnaire include VAS score component . Patients unable come follow visit interview phone one investigator relevant data , i.e . questionnaire pain score , obtain phone conversation . For patient follow phone , phone script create addition questionnaire . The total number visits/encounters 3 take place regular clinic visit appointment . The difference pre treatment post treatment score representative treatment effect . Statistical Section : Descriptive statistic use describe distribution data . The Wilcoxon sign rank test use examine pre- post- treatment symptom score difference . Paired two-sample t-test McNemar 's test also use examine pre- post-treatment difference variable interest . Sample size justification : Since Wilcoxon sign rank test use test significant difference pre- post- treatment score , power calculation base Wilcoxon sign rank test . At 80 % power level , assume correlation 0.2 pre- post- treatment score , sample size 18 ensure minimum detectable difference symptom score pre- post-treatment score 3 . Thus , sample size 30 appropriate . Example : At 80 % power level , assume correlation 0.2 pre- post- treatment score , sample size 18 ensure minimum detectable difference symptom score pre- post-treatment score 3 . Expected Results/Conclusions : The investigator anticipate significant decrease hemorrhoidal symptom , define study pain , pruritis , prolapse , soil , bleed HET bipolar system , provide validated outpatient minimally invasive treatment option symptomatic hemorrhoid . Benefits/Risks : There direct benefit subject study . The main risk research loss confidentiality information . The patient may experience mild anxiety discomfort provide information health well-being . Records store electronic data file password protect computer lock office . Master key keep separate file accessible primary investigator . Informed Consent : Informed consent provide clinic regard participation study . Refusal participate influence treatment option present deemed necessary subject 's condition . Consent obtain primary investigator and/or research fellows experience training explanation procedure , potential risk benefit . The informed consent document store subject 's electronic medical record . If non-English speaking subject encounter , informed consent translate interpretation language subject . Data Safety Monitoring Plan : This study pose minimal risk , main risk mild anxiety loss confidentiality information . If problem arise handle accord Institutional Review Board protocol . Data Collection Management Procedures : Data procurement do electronically incorporate password protect encrypt server lock office . The master key keep separate file accessible primary investigator . Reporting Unanticipated Problems : If unanticipated problem arise report University Illinois Chicago 's Insitutional Review Board per define protocol .</detailed_description>
