	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine anhedonia potential moderator treatment outcomes Cocaine Use Disorder ( CUD ) . Specifically , study investigate anhedonia affect outcomes contingency management ( CM ) treatment CUD whether anhedonia mediates effect adjunctive treatment dopaminergic ( DAergic ) drug , d-amphetamine , outcomes CM CUD , well investigate contribution anhedonia overall CUD severity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeting Anhedonia Cocaine Use Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent research suggest anhedonia key neurobehavioral dysfunction Cocaine Use Disorder ( CUD ) contribute treatment outcome . Anhedonia , define lack interest pleasure non-drug reward , frequently find CUD related neural deficit , low striatal dopamine deficient activation non-drug reward mesocortical circuit . Interestingly , individual CUD deficit . Preliminary data suggest presence self-reported anhedonia predict bad outcome contingency management ( CM ) treatment CUD . Moreover , low baseline dopamine predict failure attain abstinence CM medication enhance DA increase CM success rate responsiveness reward . This study specifically aim test contribution anhedonia overall CUD severity , relationship anhedonia outcomes CM treatment , mediate role anhedonia medication enhancement CM CUD . To accomplish aim , individual CUD enrol undergo 4 week intensive CM treatment , either without treatment dopaminergic drug , d-amphetamine . A medication group include solely measure effect d-amphetamine . Anhedonia assess use multi-modal subjective , psychophysiological behavioral measure reward function baseline , week treatment . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) measure reward functioning also take baseline week 4 subset participant ( n = 24 )</detailed_description>
