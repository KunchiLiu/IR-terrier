	<detailed_description>This phase I , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , dose-escalation study randomize 36 healthy adult participant one three cohort . The first 12 subject randomize receive PfSPZ Challenge vaccine dose 51,200 sporozoite normal saline placebo . The next 12 subject randomize receive PfSPZ Challenge vaccine dose 102,400 sporozoite placebo . The last 12 subject randomize receive PfSPZ Challenge vaccine dose 204,800 sporozoite placebo . Within group , placebo assign 1:3 , blind allocation two treatment within dose-escalation group . All subject immunize via DVI route 3 , 10 , 17 day chloroquine initiation . All subject receive , directly observe treatment , oral chloroquine ( CQ ) Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 suppressive dose 600 mg base Day 1 300 mg base Days 8 , 15 22 . At 10 week third administration study vaccine placebo , subject receive PfSPZ Challenge direct venous injection dose 3,200 P. falciparum sporozoites assess vaccine efficacy control human malarial infection . Participants receive telephone follow-up six twelve month thereafter . Malarone速 offer terminal treatment volunteer sustain malaria Day 28 first line therapy event volunteer withdrawal study prior onset clinical malaria episode . The primary objective study 1 ) evaluate safety tolerability escalate dos Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge administer DVI Days 3 , 10 , 17 healthy malaria-na誰ve adult take suppressive dos CQ .</detailed_description>
