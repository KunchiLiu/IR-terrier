	<brief_summary>In current practice patient suspect increase intracranial pressure ( ICP ) undergo lumbar puncture measurement cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) pressure ( marker ICP ) . A lumbar puncture invasive sometimes painful procedure . Using new type ICP monitor ( HeadSense ) possible measure ICP non-invasively acoustic signal</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Non-invasive ICP HeadSense Monitor v Lumbar CSF Pressure Measurement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study prospectively collect relevant clinical data 60 neurological patient , refer elective lumbar puncture ( eg . suspect multiple sclerosis , raise intracranial hypertension , etc ) . Each enrol patient monitor parallel lumbar puncture HeadSense ICP monitor . Subjects meet study inclusion exclusion criterion enrol study . Step 1 : 10 minute measurement HeadSense monitor . Once patient inclined upper body 30 degree bed pressure value , clinical procedure begin . The device must preset continuous monitoring mode . The continuous monitoring allow loop measurement unlimited time rate four measurement per minute . Step 2 : 10 minute measurement HeadSense monitor supine position . Step 3 : Patient place left lateral position . The lumbar puncture do CSF pressure measure follow standard procedure . Step 4 : 10 minute measurement HeadSense monitor supine position . Lumbar puncture HeadSense measurement do two different doctor share measurement value procedure . After study patient 's ear examine internal ear infection irritation might cause ear bud . Patient adverse event document case report form case occur family advocate patient inform . In case clinical relevant adverse event appropriate clinical action take . As procedure affect patient management , need provide specific medical care relate trial . Patients receive relevant clinical care relate clinical management , without consideration participation trial .</detailed_description>
