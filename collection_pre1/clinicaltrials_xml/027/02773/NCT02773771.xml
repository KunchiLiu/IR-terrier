	<detailed_description>Acute muscle waste occurs early rapidly first week critical illness contributes substantially weakness acquire ICU . Muscle waste subsequent weakness associate delayed liberation mechanical ventilation , prolonged hospital length stay ( LOS ) , long-term functional disability , bad quality life . Moreover , low muscle volume ICU-acquired weakness increase risk mortality critically ill patient . Although several factor likely accelerate skeletal muscle waste critical illness ( e.g. , immobility , muscle unloading , inflammation , multi-organ failure ) , understand underlying mechanism remain limited reflect lack effective intervention prevent loss muscle mass ICU patient . Muscle mass maintain balanced protein breakdown synthesis . As , waste occur , catabolic pathway must increase relative anabolic process . In general , nutritional status important factor maintain skeletal muscle homeostasis . However , adequate caloric delivery often challenge ICU patient recent data suggest high protein delivery early critical illness may adversely impact muscle protein synthesis . Moreover , randomize , placebo-controlled , clinical trial ( RCTs ) ICU patient support use aggressive early macronutrient delivery . Such finding emphasize need target therapy enhance anabolic pathway , may improve clinical outcome critically ill patient . The amino acid leucine widely regard anabolic effect muscle metabolism , concentration require maximize anti-proteolytic effect far great concentration require maximally stimulate protein synthesis . This result search leucine metabolite may also potent mediator anabolic process skeletal muscle -- one compound β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate ( HMB ) . HMB think primarily facilitate protein synthesis stimulation mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) , protein kinase responsive mechanical , hormonal , nutritional stimulus play central role control cell growth . Indeed , preclinical study demonstrate HMB supplementation increase phosphorylation mTOR well downstream target . Preclinical data also suggest HMB supplementation result increase skeletal muscle insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ) level , may stimulate mTOR . In addition , HMB may influence systemic level myostatin , key negative regulator mature skeletal muscle growth . Myostatin show reduce muscle protein synthesis inhibit mTOR signal increase proteolytic mechanism . Recent preclinical data suggest HMB may reduce myostatin level attenuate skeletal muscle atrophy . Furthermore , preclinical data show HMB also stimulate release irisin , newly discover myokine , up-regulates IGF-1 inhibits myostatin . On hand , skeletal muscle proteolysis think occur primarily ubiquitin-proteasome system , energy-dependent proteolytic system degrade intracellular protein . The activity pathway think regulate expression nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB ) , significantly increase condition fast , immobilization , bed rest , various disease state . In preclinical study , HMB show decrease proteasome expression reduce activity pathway catabolic state . Furthermore , caspase protease ( particular , caspase protease-3 caspase protease-9 ) think induce skeletal muscle proteolysis apoptosis myonuclei . Preclinical data suggest catabolic state , HMB attenuate up-regulation caspase , turn , reduces myonuclear apoptosis reduces skeletal muscle protein degradation . Randomized controlled trial ( RCTs ) assess effect HMB supplementation clinical outcome patient chronic disease limit , even few study assess effect skeletal muscle metabolism critical illness . Furthermore , despite compel preclinical evidence , exact mechanism underlie effect HMB supplementation acute catabolic stress human well define . Therefore , investigator goal study impact early HMB supplementation skeletal muscle mass surgical ICU patient explore mechanism HMB may exert beneficial effect skeletal muscle metabolism course critical illness .</detailed_description>
