	<brief_title>RCT Anesthesia/Analgesia Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain management total knee replacement ( TKR ) patient evolve rapidly previous decade . The recent advance anesthesia include peripheral nerve blockade , offer promise earlier postoperative mobilization addition effective pain relief . The rapidity advancement adopt seem outpaced science support . The result institution countless combination perioperative pain management strategy center nationwide little standardization , consistency , objective evidence . The extent various strategy achieve safe effective perioperative pain control functional preservation remain poorly define . This prospective randomize control trial aim identify meaningful patient-centric outcome measure , differentiate among three perioperative TKR anesthetic analgesic strategy , provide template interdisciplinary collaboration among orthopedic surgeon , anesthesiologist , physical therapist , patient . With knowledge gain study continue refine optimal early pain control protocol . All primary TKR patient undergo surgery Medical University South Carolina able receive spinal anesthesia randomize prior surgery one three form low limb nerve blockade : 1 ) Continuous femoral nerve catheter plus single injection sciatic nerve block , 2 ) Adductor canal catheter plus selective tibial nerve block , 3 ) Adductor canal catheter alone . All patient receive additional standardize pain medication well early mobilization physical therapy . The primary outcome measure postoperative visual analog pain scale ( VAS ) , secondary measure include validate patient-reported outcome measure , objective functional measure ( timed-up-and-go ( TUG ) , patient satisfaction score , length stay , discharge disposition , complication . The investigator plan enroll approximately 90 patient . This allow u reach randomization goal least 75 patient take account withdrawal . The 75 patient randomize three treatment three treatment arm 6-month recruitment period , 3 month follow-up patient report outcome satisfaction data . A focus group facilitate patient engagement provide information generation preference survey guide future study design .</detailed_description>
