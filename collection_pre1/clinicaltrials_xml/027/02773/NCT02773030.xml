The study consist escalate dose-escalation portion ( Part 1 ) well expansion cohort ( ie , Cohort C : Monotherapy ( MonoT ) Cohort D : Combination treatment 2 drug ( DoubleT ) recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) evaluate safety estimate preliminary efficacy ( Part 2 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Study Determine Dose Tolerability CC-220 Monotherapy Combination With Dexamethasone Subjects With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects assign CC-220 monotherapy develop PD option receive Dexamethasone ( DEX ) addition CC-220 consultation Medical Monitor . The dose CC-220 high dose CC-220 use combination dexamethasone test consider safe . Progressive disease must confirm accordance International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) criterion . The start dose DEX 40 mg Once daily ( QD ) Days 1 , 8 , 15 22 28-day cycle subject ≤75 year age . For subject &gt; 75 year age , start dose DEX 20 mg QD Days 1 , 8 , 15 22 28 day cycle . This treatment continue PD , unacceptable toxicity subject withdraws consent . The study conduct compliance International Conference Harmonisation ( ICH ) Technical Requirements Registration Pharmaceuticals Human Use/Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) applicable regulatory requirement .</detailed_description>
