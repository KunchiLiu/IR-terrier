	<detailed_description>The insufflation air viscera endoscopy indispensable order allow advancement endoscopic probe , visualize mucosa avoid injury gastrointestinal wall . However , distension bowel follow often cause abdominal discomfort since air blown appear slightly absorbable therefore need long time expel . Carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) gas already widely use insufflation endoscopy . CO2 insufflation demonstrate literature cause lower abdominal discomfort quickly reabsorb body . This gas time devoid side effect . Studies literature focus mainly intensity abdominal discomfort insufflation CO2 vs. air perform colonoscopy , endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) enteroscopy . Endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) method associate endoscopic view ultrasound vision obtain inside viscera . The main indication EUS represent study biliary pancreatic disease , stag digestive tract tumor differential diagnosis submucosal tumor . The diagnostic accuracy EUS undermine visual artifact cause presence air probe organ study ; procedure endoscopist must ensure , mean repeated suction , least possible amount air present inside viscera . Although use CO2 already widely apply many endoscopists , study date concerning use CO2 EUS point view abdominal discomfort related procedure and/or quality image obtain . At moment , regard EUS , recommendation regard use gas rather ; choice fact discretion operator also depend availability individual endoscopic unit instrumentation CO2 insufflation . At Our Endoscopic Unit , CO2 air insufflation decide upon availability equipment endoscopic room ; particular , Suite 1 , patient receive air insufflation Suite 2 receive CO2 insufflation . The assignment one endoscopic room purely casual accord schedule next free available slot . The main purpose study ass whether difference CO2 air insufflation induce discomfort patient undergoing EUS . The study design observational randomization intervention modification plan ; participant assign either air CO2 insufflation accord endoscopic room equipment ( one room equip CO2 insufflation another endoscopic room equip air insufflation ) result two group compare . Among secondary goal investigator want evaluate whether insufflation CO2 associate reduction dose require patient sedation . Finally , investigator want clarify whether use CO2 able produce less visual artifact air thus improve quality EUS image .</detailed_description>
