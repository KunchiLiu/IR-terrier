	<brief_summary>This study compare difference hemodynamic ECG parameter patient undergo urological orthopedic surgery spinal anesthesia . First group comprise patient undergoing surgery morning hour ; thus standard fast duration ( 8 hour ) , second group comprise patient undergo surgery afternoon ; thus prolong fasting duration ( &gt; 12 hour ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Preoperative Fasting ECG Vital Parameters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients schedule surgery surgical ward routinely fast 12am day surgery regardless plan hour surgery . This result near standard fasting patient plan surgery time morning hour day . However , patient plan surgery time afternoon hour day fast 12 hour . This situation may look important healthy young adult consider patient population hospital mostly consist sick elderly people , fast associate dehydration may serious deleterious effect . Our objective observe define potential deleterious effect special focus cardiovascular system patient .</detailed_description>
