	<brief_title>An Evaluation Non-Invasive ICP Monitoring Patients Undergoing Invasive ICP Monitoring Via Intraparenchymal Pressure Monitoring Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective study conduct 80 patient inserted invasive intraparenchymal ICP monitor . Once patient undergoes invasive ICP monitoring , life expectancy great 48 hour 14 year old screening visit , intact/continuous dura layer , patient become candidate enrollment study . If patient sign inform consent patient 's legal authorize representative sign patient 's behalf , patient enrol trial . Each enrol patient monitor parallel invasive ICP monitor HeadSense 's device . Once data collection complete , result analyze compare ICP reading device . The primary end-point study collect 60-120 minute ICP monitor data two session 30-60 minute 80 neurosurgery patient etiology . The secondary endpoint study evaluate safety device measure incidence adverse event serious adverse event subject 's 96 hour participation .</detailed_description>
