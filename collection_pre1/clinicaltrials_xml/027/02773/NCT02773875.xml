	<detailed_description>Investigational Device : Artificial Pancreas System Fault Detection Algorithms : Roche Accu-Check Spirit Combo Insulin Pump , Dexcom G4P System Share , Diabetes Assistant ( DiAs ) Android phone , DiAs Web Monitoring ( DWM ) - refer Remote Monitoring Server , MPC control algorithm , Health Monitoring System ( HMS ) algorithm . Sensor infusion set fault detection algorithm apply offline data obtain server notification send clinician . Control Arm : Sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy : Subject use personal insulin pump Dexcom G4P System Share . Primary Objective : To determine efficacy fault detection algorithm . The primary outcome base amount time sensor glucose &gt; 250 mg/dL 4 hour precede detection infusion set failure sensor augment pump therapy vs. closed-loop control fault detection alert . Secondary Objectives : To determine effectiveness sensor fault detection algorithm . To determine efficacy Zone MPC controller evaluate glycemic outcome Number Subjects : There 20 subject recruit : 10 Stanford 10 Denver ( 36 subject enrol reach 20 subject complete study ) Diagnosis Main Inclusion Criteria : Adult subject 18 55 year age inclusive , diagnose type 1 diabetes . Trial Design : This outpatient study conduct 6 week show figure . The 6-week period consist two 2-week block prolong infusion set wear 1-week sensor run-in period precede block . In block , subject wear infusion set 7 day . A new infusion set inserted start week block . Following enrollment procedure , subject randomize ratio 1:1 either use AP system fault detection algorithm ( intervention ) sensor-augmented pump therapy ( control ) first block .</detailed_description>
