	<brief_title>Kypho-IORT vs. EBRT Spinal Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due optimize therapy life expectancy patient metastasize cancer increase . Bone metastases affect 10 % - 30 % cancer patient , especially locate vertebral column . The main clinical problem back pain increase risk pathological fracture . Therefore optimized palliative treatment improve quality life necessary . External beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) well-established treatment option patient spinal metastasis . EBRT often result adequate pain relief good local tumor control . Of retrospective series describe pain outcome mention systematic review Gerszten et al. , mean 70 % patient improvement pain radiation therapy . The mean rate local control 77 % . Although EBRT standard treatment painful vertebral metastasis , optimal dose fraction schedule optimal standard dose establish . Different fractionation schedule EBRT discuss recently publish review . Literature data confirm time pain reduction 8-10 day EBRT . Balloon kyphoplasty another valuable treatment option patient painful instable metastasis vertebral column . In recent publish trial Berenson et al . 134 patient vertebral compression fracture enrol randomly assign kyphoplasty non-surgical management . The study find patient treated kyphoplasty significant reduction back pain seven day . Nevertheless kyphoplasty direct anticancer effect external beam radiotherapy follow avoid early regrowth . But EBRT kyphoplasty EBRT alone take 2-4 week . This long treatment period often mental physical strain . Moreover patient simultaneous visceral metastasis often need chemotherapy apply concurrently radiotherapy due risk potentiate toxicity . To reduce treatment time increase quality life novel technique like kyphoplasty combine physical method development . Recently publish trial show good result relate pain relief local tumor control patient spinal metastasis treat kyphoplasty combine intravertebral administration 153Samarium interstitial implantation 125I seed . Therefore develop novel approach deliver intraoperative radiotherapy kyphoplasty ( Kypho-IORT ) . Based recently publish report Kypho-IORT technical feasible new treatment option without severe side effect . We observe excellent pain relief . At first postoperative day improvement pain observe 11 16 ( 69 % ) patient change 5 16 ( 31 % ) patient . During follow-up , improvement pain see 75 % - 83 % patient compare preoperative status . According result dose escalation study initiate , complete ( NCT 01280032 ) . According result study dose 8 Gy 10 mm depth applicator surface ( correlate dose prescription isocenter radiation source 8 Gy 13 mm ) recommend Kypho-IORTs . According aim plan phase III study test superiority kyphoplasty vertebroplasty + IORT ( follow abbreviate Kypho-IORT ) compare EBRT regard time pain reduction define point time ( day 1 , week 2 , 6 week start treatment ) . We assume pain reduction VAS-3 point day one ( first day Kypho-IORT , one day first EBRT ) 40 % patient Kypho-IORT vs. 5 % patient EBRT standard pain medication ( change pretherapeutic pain medication 12 h Kypho-IORT rather 24 h first EBRT ) . Each study arm need 22 patient , reach alpha 0 , 05 power 0,817 . Plus dropout rate 20 % least 54 patient recruit . All patient spinal metastasis present treatment give , do advance : MRI CT total spine clinical examination , especially neurological examination . Kypho-IORT carry general anaesthesia like standard procedure minor modification . All patient place prone position radiolucent table . For intraoperative radiotherapy ( IORT ) Intrabeam System ( Carl Zeiss Surgical , Oberkochen , Germany ) use . In order carry intraoperative radiation therapy , work cannula insert affected vertebral body normal bipedicular procedure , special sleeve insert monopedicularly . These serve guide radiation applicator . After check correct position work cannula use fluoroscopic guidance , specially design applicator place precisely vertebral body . Documentation location tip INTRABEAM System perform whenever possible use bi-planar X-rays . After verification select dose 8 Gy depth 13 mm isocenter radiation source apply period approximately 5 minute . After completion radiation therapy , radiation unit include applicator remove operation conclude accordance standard procedure . The external beam radiotherapy usually carry outpatient procedure . All patient receive plan CT first irradiation . EBRT perform 30 Gy , add 3 Gy per fraction 8 Gy single dose ( international study center , permit Germany ) conventional linear accelerator ( LINAC ) . During EBRT , patient routinely see weekly physician evaluate adverse reaction . Before treatment registration form fill include follow item : - evaluation inclusion exclusion criterion , - anamnesis ( size , weight , Karnofsky Index , standard pain medication , concomitant illness ) , - objectification patient 's current pain situation use Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) local general , - primary tumor , - localization size vertebral body metastases - quality life assessment ( EORTC QLQ-C30 , EORTC QLQ-BM22 ) . Moreover patient receive MRI CT spine neurological examination . Follow-up visit schedule 6 week , 3 month , every 6 month 5 year . At follow-up follow information document : - weight , - Karnofsky Index , - general progress/regress underlie illness , - standard pain medication - pain level base VAS ( general , local ) . Furthermore , inspection surgical scar exclude wound heal problem neurological examination document functional impairment due spinal cord nerve damage carry . To assess skin toxicity , photographic documentation surgical scar/irradiation field carry . For documentation osteoradionecrosis , pathological fracture relapse MRI CT examination carry . The evaluation MRI CT examination perform radiologist respective participate clinic , case externally prepared image , radiologists medical practice . To document Quality Life , patient request complete two questionnaire European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC QLQ-C30 , EORTC QLQ-BM22 ) Kypho-IORT/EBRT follow-up examination . Answering question take approximately 10 minute . The follow-up documentation patient specific data end 5 year therapy . Classification graduate side effect rat `` Common Toxicity Criteria '' ( CTCv4.0 ) National Cancer Institute . To document acute toxicity Kypho-IORT , physical examination include particular inspection surgical scar evaluation current pain level ( VAS ) perform one day 2 week Kypho-IORT . Moreover conventional X-ray affected section spine perform one day Kypho-IORT . One day first EBRT last EBRT , same-day , physical examination evaluation current pain level ( VAS ) perform document acute toxicity . Moreover EBRT , patient routinely see weekly physician evaluate adverse reaction . If necessary , occur acute reaction document upon discharge hospital check follow-up appointment . The acquisition late toxicity do base LENT SOMA score . To document late toxicity , follow-up examination magnetic resonance image computer tomography , well another physical examination perform . Moreover photographic documentation surgical scar/irradiation field carry assess skin toxicity . Serious adverse event ( SAEs ) define event fatal , life threatening , cause prolongs hospitalization ; cause disability incapacity require medical intervention prevent permanent impairment damage , grade 4 toxicity . Only radiation surgery relate SAEs report . Hospitalization perform protocol-required procedure classify SAE . Hospitalization disease-related procedure ( surgery , imaging , laboratory test ) procedure plan entry study consider SAEs . Hospitalizations social reason absence adverse event classify SAEs either . Furthermore radiation surgery relate SAEs require therapy document ( e.g . antibiotic , re-surgery ) . In case death autopsy do clarify cause death . The trial carry compliance protocol , principle lay declaration Helsinki , version October 1996 ( long local law require follow version ) , accordance ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) , harmonize standard Medical Devices ( ISO 14155 ) applicable regulatory requirement ( local , regional global ) . Standard medical care ( prophylactic , diagnostic therapeutic procedure ) remain responsibility treat physician patient . This study approve local ethic committee Federal Office Radiation Protection . The informed consent perform write verbally responsible physician . The informed consent do least 24 h treatment . During education physician indicate withdrawal possible time result disadvantage patient . Treatment patient must discontinue one follow criterion apply : - revocation patient 's declaration inform consent - lack compliance - discontinuation therapy reason deem necessary responsible physician ( unfavorable intraoperative geometry ) - Grade IV skin toxicity , i.e . skin necroses require surgical intervention - Grade IV bone toxicity , i.e . aseptic bone necroses require surgical intervention - Grade IV nervous system toxicity , i.e . paresis When therapy discontinue , reason discontinue patient participation study must list patient 's file . The steer committee allow close study ahead schedule . Other termination criterion include : - insufficient patient recruitment - unexpectedly severe toxicity ( second Grade IV toxicity within study ) - unexpected finding prevent continuation study ethical and/or medical reason ( new benefit/risk analysis )</detailed_description>
