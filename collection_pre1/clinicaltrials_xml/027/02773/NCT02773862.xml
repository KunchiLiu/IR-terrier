	<brief_summary>Patients severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Under certain condition ( impaired consciousness ) intracranial pressure ( ICP ) measure . An increase intracranial pressure might suggest secondary neurological deterioration consider alarm symptom . Current practice insert invasive monitor burr hole skull risk bleed infection . Using new type ICP monitor ( HeadSense ) possible measure ICP non-invasively acoustic signal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Non-invasive ICP HeadSense Monitor TBI Patients Undergoing Invasive ICP Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In pilot study , investigator prospectively collect relevant clinical data 15 TBI patient insert invasive ICP monitor . Each enrol patient monitor parallel invasive ICP monitor HeadSense 's ICP monitor . Subjects meet study 's inclusion exclusion criterion enrol study . Family member ask consent . The patient 's clinical condition record case record form ( CRF ) . Once patient inclined upper body 30 degree bed invasive ICP monitor display pressure value , clinical procedure begin . Once HeadSense 's monitor calibrate connect front end place patient 's ear . Each record session Â½-48 hour long , depend patient 's clinical condition . In case ICP monitor still insert patient 's brain following day , record session continue ICP monitor remove . After study , patient 's ear examine internal ear infection irritation might cause ear bud . Patient adverse event document case report form case occur , family advocate patient inform . In case clinical relevant adverse event , appropriate clinical action take . As procedure affect patient management , need provide specific medical care relate trial . Patients receive relevant clinical care relate clinical management , without consideration participation trial . Once data collection do , result analyze compare ICP reading device . The end point study collect least half hour ICP monitoring participant .</detailed_description>
