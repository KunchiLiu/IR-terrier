	<brief_summary>Cancer patient chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( CIPN ) deficits sensory motor skill lead inappropriate proprioceptive feedback , impaired postural control high fall risk . This study investigate acceptability effect interactive motor adaptation balance train program base wearable sensor improve balance old cancer patient CIPN . Cancer patient confirm CIPN recruit randomize either intervention ( IG ) control ( CG ) group follow 6 month . The intervention group take part 6-week balance training program twice per week either home clinic ( base subject preference ) supervision qualify research staff member . This intervention include interactive game-based balance training include repetitive weight shift virtual obstacle cross task . Wearable sensor provide real-time visual/auditory feedback foot ankle position allow perception motor-errors motor-action . The control group instruct complete supervised foot ankle exercise without use sensor technology . Changes balance , gait , physical activity , number fall compare pre- post-intervention , well 3 6 month post intervention . Investigators hypothesize patient receive sensor-based exercise training benefit compare group receive conventional non-technology home-based training term improve functional performance reduce fall .</brief_summary>
