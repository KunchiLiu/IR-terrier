Aged 1865 year inclusive . Good general mental health : No clinically significant relevant abnormality medical history oral examination . Absence condition would impact participant 's safety wellbeing affect individual 's ability understand follow study procedures requirement . Selfreported history dentinal hypersensitivity ( DH ) last six month 10 year . Minimum 20 natural teeth . Minimum 2 accessible nonadjacent teeth ( incisor , canine , premolar ) , preferably different quadrant , meet follow criterion screen : Signs facial/cervical gingival recession and/or sign erosion abrasion ( EAR ) . Tooth MGI score =0 adjacent test area ( exposed dentine ) clinical mobility ≤1 . Tooth sign sensitivity measure qualify evaporative air assessment ( yes [ Y ] /No [ N ] response ) . Minimum two , nonadjacent accessible teeth ( incisor , canine , premolar ) , meet follow criterion screen : Tooth sign sensitivity , measure response qualify tactile stimulus ( Yeaple ≤ 20g ) evaporative air assessment ( Schiff sensitivity score ≥ 2 ) . Women breastfeeding , know pregnant intend become pregnant duration study . Known suspect intolerance hypersensitivity study material ( closely relate compound ) state ingredient . Previous participation study participation another clinical study ( include cosmetic study ) receipt investigational drug within 30 day screen visit . Recent history ( within last year ) alcohol substance abuse . Presence chronic debilitating disease , opinion investigator , could affect study outcome cause xerostomia . Dental prophylaxis within 4 week Screening . Tongue lip pierce presence dental implant . Gross periodontal disease , treatment periodontal disease ( include surgery ) within 12 month Screening , scale root planning within 3 month Screening . Teeth bleach within 8 week Screening . Tooth evidence current recent caries , report treatment decay within 12 month Screening . Tooth expose dentine deep , defective facial restoration , teeth use abutment fix removable partial denture , teeth full crown veneer , orthodontic band crack enamel . Sensitive teeth contribute aetiology erosion , abrasion recession expose dentine . Sensitive tooth expect respond treatment overthecounter dentifrice . Use oral care product indicated relief dentine hypersensitivity within 8 week screen . Daily dose medication/treatments , opinion investigator , could interfere perception pain . Examples medication include analgesic , anticonvulsant , antihistamine cause mark moderate sedation , sedative , tranquilisers , antidepressant , moodaltering antiinflammatory drug . Currently take antibiotic take antibiotic within 2 week Baseline . Daily dose medication , opinion Investigator , cause xerostomia .</criteria>
