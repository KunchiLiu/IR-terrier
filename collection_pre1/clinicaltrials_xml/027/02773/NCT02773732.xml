	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Oral Ciprofloxacin Etoposide Subjects With Resistant Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study look : side effect occur , effectiveness study drug , disease reacts ciprofloxacin combination etoposide . This study try find high tolerate dose ciprofloxacin without cause serious side effect . This study also look see AML respond drug use laboratory test . Ciprofloxacin commonly use antibiotic drug approve use United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . The FDA approve ciprofloxacin treat AML . Etoposide anticancer chemotherapy drug approve use FDA treatment small cell lung cancer testicular cancer . Etoposide also use treatment various blood cancer . There laboratory research show ciprofloxacin make leukemia cell sensitive etoposide chemotherapy . This observation indicate ciprofloxacin may help improve effectiveness etoposide treatment resistant AML .</detailed_description>
