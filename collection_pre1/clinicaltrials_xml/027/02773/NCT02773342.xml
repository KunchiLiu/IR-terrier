	<brief_summary>The incidence invasive pulmonary aspergillosis ( IPA ) increase part world . Despite introduction new antifungal agent prophylaxis treatment IPA last decade , outcome patient IPA still unsatisfactory need improvement . Particularly , recent development diagnostic imaging , include introduction high-resolution compute tomography ( CT ) standard procedure , make place improvement diagnosis IPA . Computed tomography chest optimal , recommend imaging procedure diagnosis pneumonia febrile neutropenic patient significantly superior conventional chest X-ray . However , method associate difficulty mostly due broad spectrum pathological finding patient IPA evolution time . This described retrospective study relatively small group patient . Prospective study large population still miss , well study combination different diagnostic modality e.g . diagnostic image microbiology . We recently publish result clinical trial : `` A Phase II Dose Escalation Study Caspofungin Patients Invasive Aspergillosis '' use caspofungin dose 70 200 mg daily first line treatment IPA . The maximum tolerate dose reach , response rate impressive complete plus partial response account 54.3 % overall mortality 12-week follow-up low 28.3 % . There tendency towards high dos yield high response rate . For majority patient obtain serial chest CT . So , first time patient population hand , kinetics infiltrates time describe . The main objective describe pathological finding chest CT perform sequentially IPA patient receive effective antifungal therapy . The specific objective : 1 . Characteristics pathological finding sequential chest CTs - To describe pathological finding ( e.g . halo sign , air crescent sign air consolidation ) sequential high resolution compute tomogrphy ( HRCT ) examinations - To calculate incidence individual pathological finding sequential CT examination - To calculate total volume fungal infiltrate sequential CT examination 2 . Correlation pathological finding sequential CT correspond white blood count ( WBC ) absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) - To correlate appearance disappearance individual pathological finding WBC ANC - To correlate volume fungal infiltrate sequential CT examination WBC absolute neutrophil count 3 . Correlation pathological finding sequential CT serum galactomannan index - To correlate appearance disappearance individual pathological finding serum galactomannan index - To correlate volume fungal infiltrate sequential HRCT examination serum galactomannan index 4 . Correlation pathological finding sequential HRCT outcome IFI - To correlate appearance disappearance individual pathological finding outcome IFI - To correlate volume fungal infiltrate sequential HRCT examination outcome IFI</brief_summary>
