	<detailed_description>PTSD characterize recurrent intrusion trauma-related memory image cause significant distress impairment affect individual . The long-term objective develop effective cognitive treatment program reduce intrusive cognition observe among individual expose significant trauma . The specific objective examine whether computerized emotional work memory training ( eWMT ) help improve work memory capability reduce trauma-related emotional symptom among individual elevate trauma-related symptom . eWMT design improve individual 's ability stay focus target filter irrelevant information work memory , expect improve trauma-related emotional symptom via improvement work memory functioning . Individuals display elevate trauma symptom randomly assign one two eWMT condition : ( ) adjustable n-back training ( i.e. , potent work memory train program ) , ( b ) fix 1-back training ( i.e. , train delivers limit dose ) . Participants blind ensure objective assessment intervention effect . Before eWMT intervention , participant undergo assessment session aim assess individual 's emotional symptom work memory-related cognitive performance . Further , follow completion procedure , participant invite follow-up assessment ass long-term effect training . The eWMT intervention deliver via Internet . Thus , current intervention home-based Internet intervention , provide important context test develop cost-efficient , accessible , effective intervention program many individual suffer exposure trauma . Each training session take 20 minute , participant condition receive total 15 training session . Participants guide complete average 3 training session every week total duration approximately 5 week . Investigators hypothesize individual undergo active eWMT display great improvement overall working memory performance great reduction trauma-related symptom , compare individual undergo less effective control train program . Pending successful outcome , study provide important knowledge guide future effort develop effective , accessible , cost-efficient intervention program reach many individual suffer exposure trauma .</detailed_description>
