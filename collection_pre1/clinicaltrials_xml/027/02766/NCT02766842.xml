	<brief_title>Evaluation New EUS Guided Biopsy Needle ( SharkCore ) Comparing Standard EUS Needle ( ProCore )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration fine needle biopsy ( EUS-FNA/FNB ) become mainstay diagnostic technique diagnosis evaluation lesion pancreas , upper gastrointestinal tract , well adjacent structure , include lymph node . Cytology specimens provide FNA fully characterize certain neoplasms lymphoma mesenchymal tumor . Core biopsy specimens histological examination need provide accurate diagnosis . ProCore needle ( ProCore , Wilson-Cook Medical Inc. Winston-Salem , NC ) design obtain histological cytological sample . Studies compare ProCore needle standard FNA needle show significant difference diagnostic accuracy , histological core tissue procurement mean number pass . To overcome mentioned limitation ( mainly suboptimal core tissue procurement rate ) , new novel SharkCore needle ( Beacon Endoscopic , Newton , MA , USA ) design approved clinical human use FDA . The objective study compare new EUS guide histology biopsy needle SharkCore currently use EUS histology needle , ProCore , histological diagnosis evaluation lesion .</detailed_description>
