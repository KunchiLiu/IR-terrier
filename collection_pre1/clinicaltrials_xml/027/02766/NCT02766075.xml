	<brief_title>A STEP Patients Prior Undergoing TAVR : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TAVR approve alternative therapy patient severe aortic valve stenosis deem inoperable high-risk surgical aortic valve replacement ( SAVR ) . Despite high procedural success rate ( &gt; 95 % ) , mortality rate TAVR 1- 2-year follow-up remain ≥25 % ≥34 % , respectively . It become increasingly evident frailty , clinical syndrome , large impact long term mortality . In study Green , et al . frailty status independently associate increase 1-year mortality ( OR=3.5 ) TAVR . The investigator ' retrospective analysis show impaired mobility malnutrition significantly associate long hospital length stay ( 5 day vs. 3 day ) , increase total cost ( average , additional $ 10,000 per patient ) . Given phenotype frailty characterize reduction muscle mass , strength , endurance activity level , STEP ideally suit counteract impairment . This pilot study aim establish whether STEP safely improve frailty score patient symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis prior undergoing TAVR . This single-center pilot study conduct partnership Heart Care Midwest ( HCMW ) , OSF St. Francis Medical Center ( OSF SFMC ) , University Illinois College Medicine Peoria ( UICOMP ) . UICOMP Center Outcomes Research provide analytical support . The study fund operational research grant OSF SFMC . This prospective , randomize control trial use parallel two-group , repeat measure design assessor blind intention-to-treat analysis . The investigator estimate take 6 month enroll necessary number patient . Serial frailty assessment subject perform blinded research assistant establish frailty profile baseline , pre-TAVR , 30-days post-TAVR .</detailed_description>
