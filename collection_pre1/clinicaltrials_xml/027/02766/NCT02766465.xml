	<brief_title>Bone Marrow Transplantation v Standard Care Patients With Severe Sickle Cell Disease ( BMT CTN 1503 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective phase II multi-center trial hematopoietic stem cell transplantation standard care base availability HLA-matched related unrelated donor confirmation clinical eligibility . In order minimize bias assignment either treatment arm , clinical eligibility treatment arm similar donor availability know referral . HLA type donor search initiate upon confirmation clinical eligibility study . Additionally , analyse primary secondary endpoint follow Intent-to-Treat principle address potential bias introduce participant donor proceed transplantation without match donor receive transplantation less well-matched donor . The primary outcome 2-year overall survival . Our hypothesis patient receive bone marrow transplantation experience early death plateau 2 year transplantation . Patients receive standard care experience early death succumb disease rate much high general population . Therefore , goal study establish difference proportion patient survive significantly 15 % low donor arm 2-years assignment treatment arm . Secondary endpoint compare change sickle cell disease related event ( pulmonary hypertension , cerebrovascular event , renal function , avascular necrosis , leg ulcer ) functional outcome [ 6-minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) , health-related quality life , cardiac function , pulmonary function , mean pain intensity assess multidimensional electronic pain diary ] baseline 2-years assignment treatment arm . Additionally patient assign donor arm expect undergo transplantation , hematopoietic recovery , graft rejection , acute chronic graft-versus-host disease , significant transplant-related complication disease-free survival report .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age 15.00 40.99 year 2 . Severe sickle cell disease [ Hemoglobin SS ( Hb SS ) , Hemoglobin SC ( Hb SC ) Hemoglobin SBeta thalassemia ( Hb Sβ ) genotype ] least 1 follow manifestation ( ae ) : 1 . Clinically significant neurologic event ( stroke ) neurological deficit last &gt; 24 hour ; 2 . History two episode acute chest syndrome ( ACS ) 2year period precede enrollment despite institution supportive care measure ( i.e . asthma therapy ; 3 . Three pain crisis per year 2year period precede referral ( require intravenous pain management outpatient inpatient hospital set ) 4 . Administration regular RBC transfusion therapy , define receive 8 transfusion per year ≥ 1 year prevent vasoocclusive clinical complication ( i.e . pain , stroke , acute chest syndrome ) 5 . An echocardiographic finding tricuspid valve regurgitant jet ( TRJ ) velocity ≥ 2.7 m/sec . 3 . Adequate physical function measure follow : 1 . Karnofsky/Lansky performance score &gt; equal 60 2 . Cardiac function : Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &gt; 40 % ; LV shorten fraction &gt; 26 % cardiac echocardiogram Multi Gated Acquisition Scan ( MUGA ) . 3 . Pulmonary function : Pulse oximetry baseline O2 saturation ≥ 85 % Diffusing capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) &gt; 40 % ( correct hemoglobin ) 4 . Renal function : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal age per local laboratory 24 hour urine creatinine clearance &gt; 70 mL/min ; GFR &gt; 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 radionuclide Glomerular Filtration Rate ( GFR ) . 5 . Hepatic function : Serum conjugate ( direct ) bilirubin &lt; 2x upper limit normal age per local laboratory ; alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; 5 time upper limit normal per local laboratory . Patients hyperbilirubinemia consequence hyperhemolysis , experience sudden , profound change serum hemoglobin RBC transfusion exclude . 1 . HLA type prior referral ( consultation HCT physician ) . However , subject HLA type accompany documentation relative HLA type search unrelated donor registry perform subject consider eligible . Documentation review adjudicate Protocol Officer his/her designee . 2 . Uncontrolled bacterial , viral fungal infection 6 week enrollment . 3 . Seropositivity HIV . 4 . Previous HCT . 5 . Participation clinical trial patient receive investigational drug device must discontinue enrollment . 6 . A history substance abuse define version IV Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSM IV ) . 7 . Demonstrated lack compliance prior medical care ( determine refer physician ) . 8 . Pregnant breast feeding female . 9 . Inability receive HCT due alloimmunization , define inability receive pack red blood cell ( pRBC ) transfusion therapy . 10 . Unwillingness use approve contraception method time biologic assignment discontinuation immunosuppressive medication assignment biologic assignment would donor arm . Additional Eligibility Criteria Transplant Biologic Assignment Donor Arm : Participants assign Donor Arm time biologic assignment subject additional transplant eligibility criterion specify . Additional , repeat clinical assessment prior transplant obtain accordance institutional policy standard care interest good clinical practice . 1 . Participants receive ≥8 pack red blood cell transfusion ≥1 year receive ≥20 pack red blood cell transfusion ( cumulative ) undergo liver MRI estimation hepatic iron content . Liver biopsy indicate hepatic iron content ≥7 mg Fe/gm liver dry weight . Histological examination must document absence cirrhosis , bridge fibrosis active hepatitis . The absence bridge fibrosis determine use histological grade stag scale describe Ishak colleague ( 1995 ) describe Manual Operating Procedures . 2 . Cerebral MRI/MRA within 30 day prior initiation transplant conditioning . If clinical radiologic evidence recent neurologic event ( stroke transient ischemic attack ) subject defer least 6 month repeat cerebral MRI/MRA ensure stabilization neurologic event prior proceed transplantation . 3 . Absence donor specific HLA antibody ( section 2.5 ) 4 . Documentation participant 's willingness use approve contraception method discontinuation immunosuppressive medication document medical record correspond consent conference . 5 . The HLAmatched donor must medically fit donate willing donate bone marrow .</criteria>
