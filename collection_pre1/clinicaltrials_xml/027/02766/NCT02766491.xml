	<brief_summary>Cerebral palsy ( CP ) prevalence 1.5-3 per 1000 live birth , make common neurological disorder among child Europe . One frequently observe problem CP hypertonia , i.e . increased muscle tension , result contracture . Stretching therapy widely use treatment contracture , highly variable success . Therefore , effort need improve efficacy stretch intervention . The investigator hypothesise increase stiffness tendon relative muscle , resistance training , prior stretch improve efficacy stretch intervention child CP . In RCT design investigator compare group child receive combine strengthening-stretching intervention calf muscle control group receive conventional stretching exercise combination upper limb exercise . Outcome measure include muscle-tendon structure gait analysis assess functional improvement . This research improve understanding muscle response stretch intervention child CP lead effective stretching therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cerebral palsy ( CP ) disorder result non-progressive lesion brain pregnancy early childhood . Children CP show impaired movement pattern compare typically develop ( TD ) child . One main factor limit movement child CP reduce range motion ( ROM ) , cause combination neural mechanical factor . Mechanical factor contribute reduce ROM increase muscle/fascicle stiffness , reduce muscle length change intramuscular tissue property , contribute contracture . Contractures conservatively treat stretch therapy , e.g. , casting , night splint physical therapy . However , demand child parent , especially physical therapy painful time-consuming . Therefore , recommend stretch therapy , need assure efficacious . However , recent review show outcomes stretch therapy child CP highly variable . Stretching intervention aim improve ROM motion increase overall length and/or lengthen property muscle . To successfully achieve adaptation , muscle must experience adequate tensile stimulus intervention . However , show previous study examine muscle behaviour stretch , muscle fascicle child CP lengthen le TD child . Our study confirm observation muscle , also show tendon child CP lengthen stretch , TD child . These observation indicate high stiffness target muscle relative series tendon prevents muscle fibre experience sufficiently large stretch stimulus , adaptation small . Accordingly , recent study long term stretch intervention show muscle fascicle strain increase , change muscle 's rest length functional improvement find . If increase stiffness tendon relative muscle prior stretch intervention , great stretch stimulus could provide muscle . This would mean give joint stretch muscle experience great portion stretch . It well establish healthy adult child stiffness tendon increase follow resistance training . Given well-designed resistance training effective safe child CP , increase tendon stiffness follow gain muscle strength group . It therefore hypothesise combined strengthening-stretching intervention would stiffen tendon , increase amount stretch see muscle , thereby improve effectiveness stretch intervention .</detailed_description>
