	<brief_summary>The goal research study see whether biofeedback therapy help treat asthma , , work . Biofeedback treatment method teach bodily control . Biofeedback widely use help people relax . In study however , investigator want learn specific type biofeedback actually improve asthma way might allow reduction elimination controller treatment like inhaled-corticosteroids .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback : It 's Role Asthma Therapeutics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine role Heart rate variability biofeedback ( HRV-BF ) asthma management either controller ( alternative ) bronchodilator ( complementary ) treatment , respect current treatment choice , ICS therapy , use different method participant demonstrate clinically significant improvement asthma outcomes investigator 's previous research ( 1 ) , add second site involve investigator 's previous work . Inflammation airways view core pathophysiologic process asthma . It think render airway reactive , therefore , susceptible bronchoconstriction , lead asthma exacerbation . Asthma episodic disease , goal therapy reduce susceptibility exacerbation , may cause severe , even life-threatening illness . Anti-inflammatory medication reduce airway reactivity , bronchodilator medication primarily relieve symptom asthma exacerbation process , may stop progressive constriction airway smooth muscle ( ASM ) . An anti-inflammatory effect HRV-BF would important implication asthma management adherence ICS regimens low due significant degree fear side effect prolong steroid medication . Even HRV-BF find allow partial reduction ICS requirement , still would likely represent major advance asthma care .</detailed_description>
