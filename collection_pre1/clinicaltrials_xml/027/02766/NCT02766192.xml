	<brief_summary>Background : The poor prognosis public health burden PTSD necessitate development effective broader treatment approach . In etiopathogenesis PTSD , trauma memory become ingrained key brain area condition learn trigger various situation daily life . The brain glutamate system play key role process trauma learn trauma memory via long-term potentiation . Ketamine administration modulates glutamate system use treatment depression PTSD . Previous study demonstrate single low dose ketamine rapidly improve symptom refractory PTSD treatment resistant depression . Unfortunately observed response short-lived ( 4-7 day , maximum 2 week ) multiple dos often produce unacceptable side effect . TIMBER ( Trauma Interventions use Mindfulness Based Extinction Reconsolidation trauma memory ) psychotherapy , manualized translational mindfulness base cognitive behavioral therapy specifically design target trauma memory expression PTSD patient . The placebo control pilot study examine efficacy protocol combine single infusion low dose ketamine ( 0.5mg/kg ) TIMBER psychotherapy subject suffer chronic PTSD . The objective pilot study optimize individualize treatment chronic PTSD use rapid , effective , trauma specific , user friendly inexpensive approach use cut edge psychopharmacological combine novel psychotherapeutic approach . Methodology : The randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled pilot study use crossover design . Ten subject refractory PTSD assign one two arm : one arm ( n=5 ) receive combined ketamine infusion TIMBER therapy ( TIMBER-K arm ) second ( n=5 ) receive combined placebo ( normal saline ) infusion TIMBER therapy ( TIMBER-P arm ) . All 10 subject receive short version TIMBER therapy 10 minute onset infusion reactivation trauma memory initiate control manner use standardized scale script narrative index trauma . This follow standardized mindfulness base cognitive therapy module quickly de-escalate arousal symptom follow induction detach observation reappraisal trauma experience . After completion 40-min infusion , subject train full version TIMBER therapy use method mindfulness base graded exposure therapy twice-daily schedule home practice initiate . The investigator currently process recruit fifty subject examine effect large sample .</brief_summary>
