A low neutrophil count know neutropenia . Both drug work increase number neutrophil produce body . This important patient low neutrophil due chemotherapy , treatment bone marrow transplant certain condition symptoms/problems relate low neutrophil count . The main aim study test Filgrastim Hospira work body compare Neupogen® .</brief_summary>
