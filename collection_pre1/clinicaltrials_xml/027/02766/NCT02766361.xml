	<detailed_description>Methods/Design The study compare Cognitive Behavioral Rehabilitation Treatment Usual ( TAU ) , latter commonly offer pharmacological treatment bipolar patient . The psychological intervention consist twelve weekly group session , last 90 minute , include 8 10 individual . Subjects randomly assign one two arm , submit 12-month follow-up . During entire study , patient medicate accordingly clinical need , change medication record secondary outcome , follow Necessary Clinical Adjustment ( NCA ) instrument . The NCA record medication adjustment implement reduce symptom , improve response functioning , handle unbearable side effect . Participants In order include , patient must 18 55 year old , literate , present IQ score high 80 diagnose bipolar I II accordingly DSM-V criterion ( APA , 2014 ) . Excluding condition : presence substance alcohol abuse last 6 month , current suicide risk , organic mental disorder score high 12 , Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) begin intervention . Recruiting take place outpatient service provide Bipolar Disorder Research Program ( PROMAN ) University São Paulo Medical School , Brazil . Patients receive invitation individually , sign inform consent . Procedure Outcomes Once include , patient complete Portuguese version follow self-report questionnaire : abbreviate instrument quality life ( WHOQOL-bref ) , Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11 ( BIS 11 ) , Social Skills Inventory ( IHS ) Biological Rhythms Interview Assessment Neuropsychiatry ( BRIAN ) . Patients also complete Functioning Assessment Short Test ( FAST ) brief questionnaire bipolar disorder . A brief neuropsychological battery conduct , include Wechsler Abbreviated Scale Intelligence ( WASI ) ( Wechsler , 1999 ) , follow subtests Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery ( CANTAB ) : Motor Screening Task ( MOT ) ; Rapid Visual Information Processing ( RVP ) ; Reaction Time ( RTI ) ; Spatial Span ( SSP ) ; Spatial Working Memory ( SWM ) ; One Touch Stockings Cambridge ( OTS ) ; Pattern Recognition Memory ( PRM ) ; Delayed Matching Sample ( DMS ) ; Attention Switching Task ( AST ) ; Emotion Recognition Task ( ERT ) . Subjects also complete initial assessment mood module Structured Clinical Interview DSM-5 ( SCID-5 ) ( APA , 2014 ) post-intervention week 12 , 6 12 month thereafter . Hypothesis The study hypothesize Cognitive Behavioral Rehabilitation , comparison TAU , : I . Decrease recurrence rate new episode ; primary outcome measure . II . Improve attention , mental flexibility , work memory emotional recognition ; secondary outcome . In exploratory analysis also assess whether Cognitive Behavioral Rehabilitation may : A . Enhances functional , social skill quality life score ; B . Increases sleep quality knowledge disorder ; C. , Reduces impulsivity Interventions Treatment Usual ( TAU ) The control group study receive standard out-patient treatment offer clinic , involve psychopharmacological mood stabilization regular contact mental health nurse . The number amount pharmacological treatment follow physician decision , respect individual demand . All pharmacological treatment monitor record accordance Litmus study ( Nierenberg et al . 2009 ) . Cognitive Behavioral Rehabilitation We develop 12-session intervention combine previous experience cognitive behavior therapy bipolar patient several element cognitive remediation . The first step identify behavior important role patients´ autonomy , follow determine cognitive domain involve . The core objective promote generalization learnt behavior daily routine . Described arrangement session , divide three major Modules : In first Module comprise four session attempt improve attention memory , consider necessity retain information discuss throughout session . There two target behavior involve : adherence pharmacological treatment mood monitoring . The cognitive remediation exercise seek enhance verbal visual memory , secondarily enhance attention paper material include manual . In first session , group member psychotherapists introduce , follow discussion regard manual , individual´s expectation importance attendance . The second session explore concept attention , importance door cognitive function ; group also learn exercise aim train attention memory . The third session focus medication adherence relation attention . The core third session organization patient´s environment , frequently chaotic ; discussion cue encourage end session . The fourth session start introduce mood graphic patient importance early identify mood episode . At end first module , patient stimulate cook method reinforce learn enhance autonomy . The second module target social cognition communication . The fifth session familiarize patient concept automatic thought ( Rush Beck , 1978 ) , guide identify presence . Cognitive distortion discuss along example provide subjects´ experience . The sixth session begin return initial theme habituate patient automatic thought record ( Beck , 1997 ) , patient stimulate restructure thought experience identify previous session . Mental flexibility empathy introduce discuss . The seventh session acquaint patient assertive communication emotion recognition teach role-playing exercise importance positive assertiveness . The eighth session follow agenda seventh . The last module Cognitive Behavioral Rehabilitation aim problem solve strategy relapse prevention . The ninth session begin identification personal problem , mainly distinguish preoccupation ; topic important patient often incorporate problem expectation desire , generate urge abandon , session end emphasize importance mental flexibility generate many response possible identify problem . In tenth session , patient learn solving-problem technique systematic setting . The eleventh session devote review information clarify possible doubts patient ; patient also encourage debate importance regular routine regular sleep , adjust use sleep hygiene technique . A progressive muscle relaxation end session . Finally , last session´s target avoid future mood relapse , return personal goal define session one prompting patient develop prevention plan . The acronym H.U.M.O.R . resume core point post-intervention maintenance program : 1 ) Habituate regular routine ; 2 ) Use learnt ; 3 ) Monitor mood ; 4 ) Observe arise problem deal effectively ; 5 ) Respond automatic thought . All patient cognitive behavioral rehabilitation group also receive TAU . Statistical Analysis Sample Size The sample size calculation base proportion patient remain episode-free 12 month follow group intervention . Previous study utilize TAU exhibit decrease bipolar relapse 30 % patient one-year follow-up . The present study anticipate 55 % success rate prevention mood relapse , period , patient assign Cognitive Behavioral Rehabilitation . Thus , consider 80 % power obtain 5 % significance , estimate sample 28 individual per group , 56 total , sufficient achieve significant result . A previous study conduct research team measure drop-out rate 10 % one year follow-up , latter reason , study consist 60 participant . Baseline Follow Data . In order measure effect intervention , study employ follow statistical test : 1 ) Qui-squared Mann-Whitney test homogeneity group begin intervention ; 2 ) Student test Mann-Whitney investigate effect intervention , pre post treatment , depend distribution data ; 3 ) An analysis variance , without adjustment mood symptom score , IQ BD duration , comparison group ; 4 ) The Kaplan-Meyer survival method log rank test statistical analysis , investigate survival data group , measure week , time first episode event .</detailed_description>
