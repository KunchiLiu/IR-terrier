	<brief_summary>This single-site , within-subject experimental basic research study design analyze hypothesis allele-specific expression bitter taste receptor T2R38 taste tissue individual heterozygous taste receptor gene TAS2R38 correlate nasal epithelium , responsible difference acyl-homoserine lactone-induced respiratory defense . Subjects include 100 predominantly European adult without chronic rhinosinusitis undergo sinonasal procedure reconstructive purpose . All subject provide saliva sample genotyping , 25 subject heterozygous TAS2R38 ( AVI/PAV ) identify . These individual ask complete beverage frequency questionnaire taste test prior procedure evaluate number compound , among bitter ligand specific T2R38 . Their tongue also photograph evaluate anatomy fungiform papilla , mushroom-like structure tongue contain taste bud . Subjects subsequently provide nasal epithelium taste tissue , process 1 ) evaluate allele-specific expression TAS2R38 mRNA taste nasal tissue , nasal tissue concurrently culture air-liquid interface system 2 ) ass AHL-induced respiratory defense ciliary beat frequency ( CBF ) nitric oxide ( NO ) production . Should subject require subsequent sinonasal procedure clinically-determined reason , taste nasal tissue obtain analyzed TAS2R38 mRNA , allow 3 ) longitudinal evaluation mRNA expression level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Basic Biology Bitter Taste . The perception bitter taste think evolve mechanism protect ingestion toxic material , result ligand-activation one 25 different bitter taste receptor , so-called T2Rs ( 1 ) . These receptor find tongue call fungiform papilla , mushroom-like structure contain taste bud receptor respond variety taste include sweet , salty , sour , umami , bitter . A prototypical example one bitter ligands phenylthiocarbamide ( PTC ) , actives T2R38 receptor . While initially identify type II taste cell , T2R38 also express nasal epithelium , participate innate immune defense response invade bacteria ( 2-6 ) . TAS2R38 : A Model System Genotype-Phenotype Studies . Prior study identify two main form T2R38 , active inactive , characterize three genetic variant TAS2R38 gene . These variant result three amino acid change , proline ( P ) alanine ( A ) position 49 , alanine ( A ) valine ( V ) position 262 , valine ( V ) isoleucine ( I ) position 296 T2R38 receptor . Individuals homozygous active ( PAV/PAV ) form detect bitterness compound contain thiourea ( -N-C=S ) moiety , include PTC , 6-n-propylthiouracil ( PROP ) , plant compound goitrin , common food green vegetable ( 7-9 ) . They also respond acyl-homoserine lactones ( AHLs ) , class compound produce signal molecule certain bacteria , trigger rapid defense reaction consist increase ciliary beat frequency ( CBF ) facilitate mucociliary clearance , generation nitric oxide ( NO ) , gas diffuse airway kill bacteria ( 4 ) . In contrast , homozygous three variant ( AVI/AVI ) consume compound without perceive bitter appear respond AHLs ( 10 ) . The frequency active inactive form TAS2R38 near balance 50:50 many human racial group , include Americans European African descent . The Heterozygote Hypothesis . Interestingly , individual heterozygous active form receptor ( AVI/PAV ) exhibit highly variable phenotype , people sensitive bitter compound , others need high concentration taste ( 11 ) . While investigator know taste papillae density play least role variability , preliminary taste data suggest range response tie much mRNA express active ( PAV ) form receptor , concept call allele-specific expression ( 12 ) . For example , case analyze caffeine consumption , strongly correlate active mRNA expression ( 12 ) . The investigator therefore hypothesize abundance active TAS2R38 mRNA heterozygous individual also predict biologically significant change magnitude defensive response presence AHLs ( 13-15 ) . The propose study determine whether fact case , whether people high mRNA abundance taste tissue ( fungiform papilla ) also correspondingly high abundance nasal epithelium , whether regulation tissue-dependent . This allow u determine whether taste test could provide reliable representation receptor function tissue cell type . Should mRNA abundance prove key factor , investigator determine whether high expressers sustain expression time . Of note , study perform Dr. Reed collaborator find population Philadelphia contain 18 % individual homozygous nontaster ( AVI ) group , 17 % homozygous taster ( PAV ) group 37 % common heterozygous group ( AVI/PAV ) ( 16 ) . The remain 28 % distribute among ten less common genotype , analyze study . Thus , majority population heterozygous , thorough understanding ability fight infection clinically important . Clinical Significance . As one common chronic condition United States , chronic rhinosinusitis invokes direct treatment cost $ 3.5-5 billion annually . Its incidence 146 per 1,000 increase ( 17 ) . Our prior study show individual two copy active form T2R38 nasal epithelium defend effectively certain bacteria , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , less likely develop severe chronic rhinosinusitis require surgery , two inactive form defend effectively , likely develop severe chronic rhinosinusitis require surgical intervention . Because treatment chronic rhinosinusitis involve multiple round antibiotic often surgical management functional endoscopic sinus surgery ( FESS ) , research significant implication antibiotic stewardship , surgical morbidity mortality , health care expenditure .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Key inclusion criterion include age 2150 year English speaking , plan undergo sinonasal procedure reconstructive purpose reason . Key exclusion criterion include history chronic rhinosinusitis Plans undergo procedure reason reconstruction Oral disease Pregnancy , condition would prevent psychophysical testing . Subjects show sign oral disease , include tongue lesion xerostomia , would exclude tongue sampling , therefore exclude study . Subjects exclude economic status , gender , race ethnicity .</criteria>
