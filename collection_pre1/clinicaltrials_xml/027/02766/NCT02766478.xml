	<detailed_description>This double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled trial daily oral genistein 24 men initiate Androgen Deprivation Therapy ( ADT ) prostate cancer ( PCa ) . Genistein natural supplement come soy . The purpose study see genistein effect prevent reduce heart disease diabetes risk men receive ADT PCa . A combination nutritional measure , blood marker image tool assess body composition , lipid level insulin resistance . Information study increase understand intervention may prevent reduce health risk prostate cancer treatment . All participant receive standard counseling diet exercise oncology care team . Participants ask withhold additional dietary supplement ( exception 1 standard daily multivitamin ) study period . Participants also ask complete food diary three day ( two weekday 1 weekend day ) . Subjects randomize stratified diabetes status either 60 mg/day oral genistein ( 30 mg take twice daily ) , match placebo . The goal randomize base diabetes status ensure approximately number subject diabetes diabetes receive genistein placebo . During follow-up , subject receive weekly reminder via phone call , text , email enhance compliance monitor potential adverse event . The 3-month study visit schedule coincide subject 's standard care follow-up visit . Three-month assessment baseline assessment . Investigators seek ass index insulin dynamic ( insulin sensitivity secretion ) determine oral glucose tolerance test 12 week daily genistein placebo supplement . Measures vascular function 12 week daily genistein placebo supplement also assess via ultrasound along metabolic measure via blood draw .</detailed_description>
