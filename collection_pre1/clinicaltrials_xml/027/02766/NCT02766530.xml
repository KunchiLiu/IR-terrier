	<brief_summary>The investigator use integrated PET/MR goal : 1 . Use PET-guided proton MRS ( MR spectroscopy ) DCE MRI ( dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI ) patient receive NAC ( neoadjuvant chemotherapy ) breast cancer monitor treatment response . 2 . Use dynamic static PET monitor treatment response NAC , investigate correlation PET result versus MRS , DCE MRI . 3 . Compare clinical stag PET/MR clinical assessment . 4 . On pre-chemotherapy study , investigate association molecular marker status dynamic static PET , MRS DCE MRI parameter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Breast MRI dynamic contrast-enhanced series ( DCE MRI ) sensitive breast cancer diagnosis ( sensitivity 95-100 % ) variable specificity ( 37-97 % ) . Breast MRI also use pre-operative staging , monitor therapeutic response neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC ) . DCE MRI analysis semi-quantitative pharmacokinetic method discriminate responder versus non-responders NAC . Analysis choline peak proton MR spectroscopy ( MRS ) increase MRI specificity breast lesion diagnosis 82-100 % . Choline analysis also use monitor treatment response NAC . The change choline integral parallel response status NAC well correlate ( r=0.91 ; P=0.01 ) change lesion size , choline change find early 24 hour first dose chemotherapy . Breast Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) 18F-FDG ( 2-deoxy-2- ( 18F ) fluoro-D-glucose ) mainly use stag monitor treatment response NAC , reduction FDG uptake ( P &lt; 0.001 ) evident tumor size ( P=0.005 ) . However , FDG PET display limited role evaluation primary breast cancer , brain axillary lymph node metastasis . There publication regard combine FDG PET/CT breast MRI breast cancer diagnosis monitor NAC response . The SUV static PET MRI finding correlate well molecular marker status breast cancer ( ER , PR , HER2 ) , associate clinical outcome . The change choline integral MRS well correlate peak SUV NAC ( r=0.84 , P=0.02 ) .The change dynamic PET parameter include rate constant uptake , washout FDG influx moderately correlate DCE MRI parameter reflect response status NAC . However , PET/CT MRI perform two machine different time , breast position different , cause lesion target sometimes difficult . Moreover , selection ROI/VOI PET MRS , DCE MRI subjective inter-observer bias . A new technology- PET/MR- solve problem . PET/MR less radiation offer soft tissue detail PET/CT . A recent PET/MR design- integrate PET/MR- commercially available . Using integrated PET/MR , patient undergo whole body PET MRI time , follow dedicate protocol specific organ primary tumor origin . The ROI/VOI breast DCE MRI , MRS select accord SUVmax site PET , objective ensure VOI/ROI location across technique . PET/MR show comparable reliability PET/CT detection oncologic disease , contribute even change clinical management PET/CT . However , use PET/MR breast cancer seldom report . The investigator use integrate PET/MR study : 1 . Use PET-guided proton MRS DCE MRI patient receive NAC breast cancer monitor treatment response . 2 . Use dynamic static PET monitor treatment response NAC , investigate correlation PET result versus MRS , DCE MRI . 3 . Compare clinical stag PET/MR clinical assessment . 4 . On pre-chemotherapy study , investigate association molecular marker status dynamic static PET , MRS DCE MRI parameter .</detailed_description>
