	<brief_title>Pivotal Study MRI-guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Profound Medical Inc. develop novel technology call MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound therapy system ( TULSA-PRO ) . The technology develop patient organ confined prostate cancer . The therapeutic endpoint technology thermal coagulation prostate tissue . The treatment conduct within MRI suite , enable real-time temperature image heat region acquire ultrasonic treatment deliver . Using MRI thermometry treatment , dynamic temperature feedback control intensity ultrasound beam rotation Ultrasound Applicator shape pattern thermal coagulation accurately precisely prostate gland . It provide advantage non-invasive procedure short treatment time .</detailed_description>
