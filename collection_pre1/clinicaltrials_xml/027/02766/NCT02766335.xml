	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well anti-B7H1 monoclonal antibody MEDI4736 ( MEDI4736 ) work treat patient stage IV squamous cell lung cancer come back previous treatment . This `` non-match '' sub-study include screened patient eligible biomarker-driven sub-study . Monoclonal antibody , MEDI4736 , may able shrink tumor . MEDI4736 may effective treat patient squamous cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1400A Lung-Map : MEDI4736 Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Stage IV Squamous Cell Lung Cancer No Matching Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CO-PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial ) among patient treat MEDI4736 . II . To assess response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial ) among programmed death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) positive patient treat MEDI4736 . SECONDARY AND EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess investigator-assessed progression-free survival ( IA-PFS ) among patient treat MEDI4736 . II . To assess IA-PFS among PD-L1 positive patient treat MEDI4736 . III . To assess overall survival ( OS ) patient treat MEDI4736 . IV . To assess OS PD-L1 positive patient treat MEDI4736 . V. To evaluate frequency severity toxicity associate MEDI4736 . VI . To assess immune-related IA-PFS use modify response criterion adapt immunotherapy ( immune-related response criterion [ irRC ] -IA-PFS ) patient subset patient determine PD-L1 positive treat MEDI4736 . VII . To compare IA-PFS , irRC-IA-PFS , OS , toxicity response rate patient randomize MEDI4736 versus docetaxel . TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE OBJECTIVES : I . To identify additional predictive prognostic tumor/blood biomarkers beyond choose biomarker . II . To identify potential resistance biomarkers disease progression . III . To establish tissue/ blood repository patient refractory squamous cell cancer . MEDI4736 RE-TREATMENT OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) among patient re-treated MEDI4736 . II . To estimate median PFS date re-treatment . OUTLINE ( CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 12/18/2015 ) : Patients tumor match one currently active drug-biomarker combination receive anti-B7H1 monoclonal antibody MEDI4736 intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 2 week 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Upon evidence progression follow discontinuation 12 month treatment , patient may restart treatment continue 12 additional month ( Arm III ) . ARM I : ( Closed accrual 12/2015 ) Patients receive anti-B7H1 monoclonal antibody MEDI4736 intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II ( CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 4/2015 ) : Patients receive docetaxel IV day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ( closed accrual Revision # 2 4/22/15 ) ARM III : For patient assign Arm 1 , MEDI4736 : Upon evidence progression follow discontinuation 12 month treatment , patient may restart treatment Arm 3 , MEDI4736 12 month treatment guideline follow initial 12-month treatment period . Patients able restart treatment ; thus maximum two 12-month period allow . Patients receive anti-B7H1 monoclonal antibody MEDI4736 IV 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month first 2 year end year 3 date sub-study/re-registration .</detailed_description>
