	<brief_title>International Registry ASD Closure Using Occlutech®Flex II Device More Than 2000 Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Interventional ASD closure generally safe procedure small amount severe side effect include mainly erosion atrial wall , embolizations arrhythmias . The IRFACODE study show excellent result Patients various generation Occlutech device . IRFACODE II study evaluate performance safety Occlutech® Flex II device patient closure secundum atrial septal defect ( ASD II ) . Methods : The IRFACODE II study retrospective , non-randomized open access study centre minimum 50 patient evaluate safety side effect ASD closure device . A minimum 2000 patient ASD II close device 31 . June 2016 enrol , follow-up 31 . June 2017 . Primary outcome measure safety amount erosion minimum follow-up time 12 month . Primary outcome measure device performance include success complete ASD closure . Secondary outcome measure safety include technique implantation , success rate anatomically difficult ASDs , incidence arrhythmia ( AV block , atrial fibrillation flutter ) , device embolization , embolic event migraine . A subgroup analysis accord patient age anatomy defect perform . Outlook : The IRFACODE II study first trial intend detect actual incidence erosion ASD closure use Flex II device . Although trial primarily design study safety device performance , incidence potential side effect also evaluate .</detailed_description>
