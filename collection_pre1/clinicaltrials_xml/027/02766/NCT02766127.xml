	<brief_summary>Aim : To compare desensitize capacity Vertise Flow™ ( VF ) , new self adhere material , treatment dentine hypersensitivity ( DH ) patient xerostomic due radiotherapy head neck cancer . Methods : A total 17 patient select study . The study conduct split-mouth randomized clinical trial comparing : 1 ) VF 2 ) Universal Dentin Sealant ( UDS ) , 3 ) Clearfil Protect Bond ( CPB ) 4 ) Flor-Opal® Varnish ( FOV ) . Basal stimulate salivary flow record patient accord method describe Sreebny . The pain experience generate cold stimulus directly sensitive tooth surface assess use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . The response record application material ( PRE-1 ) , immediately ( POST-1 ) , 1-week ( POST-2 ) , 4-weeks ( POST-3 ) 12-week control ( POST-4 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants The study design split-mouth randomized clinical trial . The protocol inform consent form approve ethic committee University Sassari ( n° 1000/CE ) . To participate study , subject carefully inform study 's purpose , risk benefit . The study inclusion criterion follow : - Generally good health despite seriousness illness ; - A clinical reduction salivary flow ; - The presence two three teeth hypersensitive stimulation blast air . In addition , patient consider suitable study sensitive teeth show abrasion , erosion recession exposure cervical dentine . The study exclusion criterion : - teeth subjective objective evidence carious lesion , pulpitis , restoration , premature contact , crack enamel , active periapical infection receive periodontal surgery root-planning 6 month prior investigation ; - patient receive professional desensitizing therapy previous 3 month ; - patient use desensitize toothpaste last 6 week . Patients also exclude significant medication could interfere pain perception ( e.g. , antidepressant , anti-inflammatory drug , sedative , muscle relaxant ) . Clinical Procedure Saliva collection All salivary assessment perform absence acute sialadenitis . All assessment perform observer . The flow rate determine every person accord method describe Sreebny . Saliva collect standardised manner . Patients instructed eat , drink , smoke 90 minute sialometric assessment . All assessment perform fixed time day , 10 1 pm , order minimise fluctuation related circadian rhythm salivary secretion composition . The whole saliva sample collect pre-weighed plastic tube use electronic scale . Unstimulated salivary secretion collect 5 min patient seat upright position , head tilt forward . When possible tongue , cheek lip movement limited procedure . At end collection period patient expectorate saliva test-tube . Stimulated whole saliva sample collect ask patient chew small block paraffin wax chew gum . All saliva secrete 5 min collect test-tube . Measuring vessel weigh collection use electronic scale , salivary flow rate express ml/min , nearly equivalent g/min ( 31 ) . A secretion rate &lt; 0.1-0.2 ml/min unstimulated flow &lt; 0.5-0.7 ml/min stimulate flow consider objective sign hyposalivation . Assessment hypersensitivity application desensitize agent . A week experiment , patient receive oral prophylaxis . Non-fluoride toothpaste ( Biorepair , Coswell ) , soft toothbrush ( Oral-B Sensitive Advantage , Procter &amp; Gamble ) oral hygiene instruction also provide . The level sensitivity experience patient consider independent position hypersensitive tooth oral cavity . The pain experience assess Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) use methodology describe previous study . The pain experience measure use VAS grade 1 10 . The pain stimulus give one examiner equipment yield similar air pressure time , another one perform treatment . The operator carry sensitivity test evaluate subject 's response application material ( PRE-1 ) , immediately ( POST-1 ) , 1 week ( POST-2 ) , 4 week ( POST-3 ) , 12 week ( POST-4 ) . The following dental material use follow manufacturer ' instruction : Verities Flow™ ( VF ) ( Kerr Corporation , Orange , CA , USA ) , self-adhering composite ; Universal Dentin Sealant ( UDS ) ( Ultradent Products Inc. , South Jordan , UT , USA ) , biocompatible , non-polymerizable , high molecular weight resin sealant alcohol solvent ; Clearfil Protect Bond ( CPB ) , ( Kuraray Noritake Dental , Osaka , Japan ) methacrylate-based resin , self-etching adhesive system , Flor-Opal® Varnish ( FOV ) , ( Ultradent Products Inc. , South Jordan , UT , USA ) , fluoride-based varnish . In view treatment desensitize agent , teeth randomly assign four group ( N = per group ) .</detailed_description>
