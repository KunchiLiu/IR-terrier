	<brief_title>Medication Adherence Improvement Support App For Engagement - Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Medication adherence Improvement Support App For Engagement - Blood Pressure ( MEDISAFE-BP ) trial prospective , intent-to-treat randomize control trial evaluate impact Medisafe smartphone application blood pressure control self-reported medication adherence patient uncontrolled blood pressure . Recruitment conduct Evidation Health , use online strategy virtually announce , recruit , verify eligibility enroll participant clinical study . Potential study subject evaluate inclusion exclusion criterion , give informed consent , complete baseline assessment , send Bluetooth-enabled home blood pressure cuff verify uncontrolled blood pressure ( systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg overall blood pressure ≤ 180/120 mmHg ) . Patients provide study overview blood pressure measurement guide outline set monitor take accurate measurement , well standard insert use home monitor associate smartphone application . Blood pressure reading electronically transmit Evidation Health via Application Program Interface ( API ) blood pressure monitor manufacturer . Blood pressure calculate average two measurement take five minute apart . Once blood pressure reading confirm elevated , patient undergo randomization 1:1 ratio intervention control use simple randomization random number generate time study enrollment . Analyses perform intent-to-treat basis , subject analyze group assign randomization . We use linear regression assess impact Medisafe study 's two primary outcome ( change systolic blood pressure self-reported adherence ) two study group , three month randomization .</detailed_description>
