	<brief_title>Non-dispensing Fitting Study Comparing Clinical Performance Hydrogel Sphere Design Contact Lenses .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 35-subject , double mask , randomize , contra lateral , non-dispensing fitting trial compare different hydrogel lens material .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>A person eligible inclusion study he/she : Is 18 40 year age ( inclusive ) . Has selfreported visual exam last two year . Is adapted soft CL ( Contact Lens ) wearer . Has CL spherical prescription 1.00 6.00 ( inclusive ) Has spectacle cylinder 0.75D ( Diopters ) eye . Can achieve best correct spectacle distance visual acuity 20/25 ( 0.10 logMAR ) good eye . Can achieve distance visual acuity 20/30 ( 0.18 logMAR ) good eye study contact lens . Has clear cornea active ocular disease . Has read , understood sign information consent letter . Patient contact lens refraction fit within available parameter study lens . Is willing comply wear schedule . Is willing comply visit schedule . A person exclude study he/she : Has never wear contact lens . Currently wear rigid gas permeable contact lens . Has history achieve comfortable CL wear ( 5 day per week ; &gt; 8 hours/day ) Has CL prescription outside range 1.00 6.00D Has spectacle cylinder â‰¥1.00D cylinder either eye . Has contact lens best correct distance vision bad 20/25 ( 0.10 logMAR ) either eye . Presence clinically significant ( grade 24 ) anterior segment abnormality . Presence ocular systemic disease need medication might interfere contact lens wear . Slit lamp finding would contraindicate contact lens wear : Pathological dry eye associate finding Pterygium , pinguecula , corneal scar within visual axis Neovascularization &gt; 0.75 mm limbus Giant papillary conjunctivitis ( GPC ) bad grade 1 Anterior uveitis iritis ( past present ) Seborrheic eczema , Seborrheic conjunctivitis History corneal ulcer fungal infection Poor personal hygiene Has know history corneal hypoesthesia ( reduced corneal sensitivity ) Has aphakia , keratoconus highly irregular cornea . Has Presbyopia dependence spectacle near work contact lens . Has undergone corneal refractive surgery . Is participate type eye related clinical research study .</criteria>
