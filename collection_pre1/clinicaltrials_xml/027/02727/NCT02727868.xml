	<brief_summary>The evaluation impact environment incidence cancer major public health issue . Increased knowledge area necessary implementation primary prevention mean appropriate preventive measure also implementation secondary prevention measure target screen action . Among environmental exposure may lead cancer , mutagenic environment major importance , causal link environmental genotoxicity cancer establish long time . It also well establish susceptibility mutation highly variable among individual . This explain genetic polymorphism gene involve metabolism genome stability . The identification biomarkers exposure mutagenic environment necessary assess impact environment human . Some study animal show PIG-A gene may biomarker exposure mutagenic environment . In particular , significant increase erythrocyte PIG-A mutant demonstrate rat genotoxic exposure cisplatin , far evaluated human . One study healthy volunteer show frequency PIG-A mutate cell human estimate efficiently reliably . The PIG-A gene meet necessary criterion sentinel gene track spontaneous somatic mutation frequency induce mutagenic environment : ubiquitous expression , phenotypic change link mono-allelic mutation viability mutate cell , spectrum inactivate mutation ( deletion , substitution , chromosomal rearrangement ) . Finally , detection disappearance glycosylphosphatidylinositol plasma membrane easily achievable flow cytometry .</brief_summary>
