	<detailed_description>This study intend compare combination general anesthesia ( GA ) single-shot bilateral thoracic paravertebral block ( TPVB ) ropivacaine patient undergo off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery ( OPCAB ) traditional general anesthesia ( GA ) perioperative management patient , commit reduce patient 's physical psychological stress surgical trauma , achieve purpose fast recovery , order establish effective perioperative management off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery , improve patient ' satisfaction accelerate postoperative rehabilitation safely . Patients include study ( approximately 60 case ) randomly divide PVB ( T2/3+T5/6 ) +GA experimental group ( A ) , PVB ( T3/4 ) +GA experimental group ( B ) conventional GA control group ( C ) . All group receive preoperative preparation , anesthesia postoperative treatment accord traditional manner , group A patient receive bilateral thoracic paravertebral block ( TPVB T2/3+T5/6 ) ropivacaine ( 0.3 % ,10ml*4 ) , group B receive bilateral thoracic paravertebral block ( TPVB T3/4 ) ropivacaine ( 0.3 % ,20ml*2 ) . , group C receive conventional general anesthesia management without block .</detailed_description>
