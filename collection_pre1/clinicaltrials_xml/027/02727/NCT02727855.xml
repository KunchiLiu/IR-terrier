	<brief_summary>To evaluate preventive impact , demand , acceptability , uptake , feasibility , cost-effectiveness two-dose regimen OCV Shanchol child live urban slum Bangladesh , Investigators conduct target mass immunization programme , use innovative approach successfully deploy Bangladesh government recent countrywide campaign MR vaccination 52 million child age 9 month 14 year ( &lt; 15 year ) . Investigators undertake census geographic population approximately 300,000 person , GIS location household . This census update every 6 month follow-up period permit track birth , death , migration , include change location individual 's residence . Following initial census , OCV offer non-pregnant individual age 1 14 year . Operational research economic study evaluate coverage , feasibility , acceptability , demand , cost cost-effectiveness vaccination programme .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Burden : Cholera remain major global problem , result 100,000 death several million case annually , mostly child . Vaccination reconsider key component public health response cholera . Bangladesh one world 's high burden endemic cholera , estimate 300,000 cholera case 4,500 death annually , high caseloads frequent outbreak half country . The endemicity cholera Bangladesh demonstrate predictable yearly occurrence disease country 's high-risk district repetitive seasonal pattern cholera outbreak , either spring autumn , . Knowledge gap : More evidence need address uncertainty around cholera disease burden , well impact , feasibility , cost-effectiveness various vaccination strategy cholera , add exist knowledge base . A special need acquire field evidence vaccine attribute setting endemic cholera , account large fraction global cholera disease burden , also recognize . Relevance : Nonetheless , assertion selective vaccination child OCV impactful approach control cholera population level rest unproven assumption , since study directly address vaccination strategy . Therefore , study whether targeted mass immunization create efficiencies general mass immunization would , warrant . The Investigators therefore believe compel question control endemic cholera Bangladesh target 1-14 year old urban slum , use establish platform target mass childhood immunization recently deploy GOB measles-rubella ( MR ) vaccine , impact overall burden cholera population feasible cost-effective strategy . Addressing question add evidence base cost efficient effective setting strategy use OCV control endemic disease optimize health impact . Hypothesis : Vaccination child 15 year age urban slum Dhaka confer least 50 % overall protection entire population combine direct indirect protective effect cost effective . Objectives : To evaluate feasibility , efficiency , impact two-dose regimen oral cholera vaccine ( OCV ) Shanchol deliver child age 1-14 year reside urban slum , leverage target mass immunization delivery platform use vaccine Bangladesh . Methods : Observational design base contrast person get vaccinate accord public health practice ( Age-targeted mass immunization program ) .</detailed_description>
