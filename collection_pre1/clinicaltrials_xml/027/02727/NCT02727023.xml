	<brief_summary>The Investigators study effect Osteopathic Manipulative Lymphatic Pump Treatment level anandamide Saliva . A qualitative scale also used measure canabinomimetic effect osteopathic treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect OMM Anandamide Levels Saliva</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Endocannabinoid System signal system compose : 2 G-Protein coupled receptor ( CB1 CB2 ) , substance act cannabinoid receptor , enzyme protein involve regulate endocannabinoids tissue receptor . The substance act cannabinoid receptor CB1 CB2 call endocannabinoids . The present study examines effect Osteopathic Manipulative Lymphatic Pump Techniques level anandamide , endocannabinoid , saliva sample adult subject . Based exist research , investigator hypothesize subject undergo osteopathic lymphatic treatment increase level anandamide . Establishing level endocannabinoids subject allow direct measure efficacy Osteopathic Manipulative Lymphatic technique . In addition quantification endocannabinoid level saliva , series 16 , 100 mm analog scale use assess cannabinomimetic effect subject pre post OMM treatment/control correlate change endocannabinoid level .</detailed_description>
