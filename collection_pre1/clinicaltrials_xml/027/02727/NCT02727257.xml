	<brief_summary>In study Investigators explore two question : attentive reaction time differs parkinsonian patient health control intensive , focus aerobic rehabilitation program ( Multidisciplinary Intensive Rehabilitation Treatment - MIRT ) tailor mainly motor problem , could specific positive effect multiple choice Reaction Times ( RTs ) indirect marker effect attentional-executive frontal circuit . The hypothesis MIRT could positive effect top-down control mechanism , since continuous feedback give physiotherapist exercise use cue device ( treadmill plus stabilometric platform ) , stimulate selective attention process enable goal-directed , internally-driven decision , help patient overcome externally-driven decision base stimulus salience novelty</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Motor-cognitive Rehabilitation Attention Parkinsonian Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To evaluate attentive performance Parkinsonians comparison healthy control effect motor-cognitive rehabilitation program attention . Methods : 103 Parkinsonians ( stage 2,5-3 H &amp; Y ) hospitalize 4-week Multidisciplinary Intensive Rehabilitation Treatment 34 healthy control enrol . All subject underwent three different attentive task : visual reaction time , auditory reaction time multiple choice reaction time task . To evaluate effect rehabilitation attention , patient perform battery discharge . To investigate effect MIRT motor function quality life also assess UPDRS III , Timed Up Go test Parkinson 's Disease Questionnaire .</detailed_description>
