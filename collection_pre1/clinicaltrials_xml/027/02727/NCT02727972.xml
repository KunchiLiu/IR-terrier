	<detailed_description>With recent advancement positron emission tomography ( PET ) radioligand development , investigator able image quantify metabotropic glutamatergic system ( mGluR5 ) vivo human subject . The study propose novel investigation mGluR5 depression obtain critical data advance understanding etiology depression associate symptom cognitive dysfunction . Aim 1 : To determine mGluR5 availability individual mood disorder compare healthy control measure PET brain imaging . Hypothesis 1 : The study hypothesize decrease mGluR5 availability individual mood disorder region responsible emotional cognitive process , include amygdala , hippocampus , thalamus , anterior cingulate , frontal cortex . Aim 2 : To determine glutamate cycling individual mood disorder alter compare healthy control measure [ 1H ] MRS [ 13C ] MRS. Hypothesis 2 : The study hypothesize increase glutamate number individual mood disorder compare control . Aim 3 : To determine PET alteration glutamatergic system depressed individual associate cognitive deficit observe depression , include concentration , attention , memory . Hypothesis 3 : The study hypothesize positive relationship mGluR5 availability cognitive functioning , individual higher receptor availability perform good test concentration , attention , memory individual low receptor availability . Aim 4 : To determine mGluR5 availability individual anxiety schizophrenia compare healthy control measure PET brain imaging . Hypothesis 4 : Anxiety disorder obsessive compulsive disorder , delusional disorder schizophrenia frequently comorbid mood disorder , glutamatergic system observe compromised individual well . This study examine regional difference mGluR5 availability individual depression , bipolar disorder , obsessive compulsive disorder , schizophrenia . Aim 5 : To examine whether change mGluR5 availability dependent state , whether low availability due trait . Hypothesis 5 : Due change endogenous GLU show MRS study , study hypothesizes normalization ( increase ) mGluR5 availability euthymia compare depressed state . Aim 6 : To compare SV2A availability individual MDD , healthy control individual , individual PTSD use APP311 PET . Hypothesis 6 : The study hypothesize low SV2A density MDD PTSD prefrontal cortex .</detailed_description>
