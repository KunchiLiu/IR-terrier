	<brief_summary>This effectiveness-implementation study part large study BETA-PD ( Balance , Elderly , Training Activity Parkinson 's Disease ) , long-term goal reduce risk fall people Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) improve balance , gait physical activity level . The main hypothesis highly challenging balance train lead great gait balance ability , increased level physical activity improve health relate quality life . The main aim study evaluate effectiveness HiBalance program real-life clinical setting , explore facilitator barrier program implementation wider scale .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Implementation HiBalance Program Clinical Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical feature PD include progressive postural instability , hypokinesia , tremor rigidity . It therefore common people PD experience reduce balance gait function , symptoms far-reaching negative effect health quality life . Injurious fall fear fall especially prevalent among PD , factor may partly explain group less physically active old people similar age without diagnosis . Balance gait training , hand , show effective PD also appear potential neuro-protective property . Research area balance training PD disease however sparse previous intervention criticize apply train stimulus lack intensity challenge . The HiBalance program base scientifically well-established principle exercise train postural control well current research training PD . The program develop affect symptom-specific balance impairment PD target four main subsystem underlie balance control ( stability limit , anticipatory postural adjustment , sensory integration motor agility ) . The intervention consist 10-week progressive balance training program group format ( 5-7 participant ) . Each training session conduct minimum 2 physiotherapist trainer , twice weekly 1-hour session ( 20 hour total ) . Additionally , home-exercise program carry participant week trial period . The difficulty level group-based training increase three consecutive block . To ensure highly challenging exercise , task individually adjust alter area base support , increase movement speed/amplitude and/or restrict vision vary grade multitasking . The program previously proven feasible [ Conradsson , 2012 ] effective [ Conradsson , 2015 ] improve balance gait impairment randomize controlled hospital setting . In addition , favorable transfer effect see relation physical activity level performance activity everyday life . For research intervention adopt real-life clinical setting however level adaptation require . Best practice involve evaluate effectiveness efficacious program clinical setting , order verify whether adaptation attenuate effective core element program . The current study combine clinical effectiveness trial together implementation research . Use type-1 hybrid design allow effect HiBalance program clinical setting test simultaneously gather information barrier facilitator implementation process [ Curran , 2012 ] . Use hybrid design also allow constant monitoring process intervention apply , therefore allow problem early application identify quickly alter ensure good outcome . A participatory approach adhere whereby 'users ' program ( physiotherapist trainer ) actively involved stage program adaptation , process outcome evaluation . This approach recommend order increase relevance , acceptability successful implementation program . The Consolidated Framework Implementation Research ( CFIR ) use current study guide investigation potential barrier facilitator implementation process [ Damschroder , 2009 ] .</detailed_description>
