	<brief_title>Smartphone Pain App Assessing Oral Mucositis Pain Patients Receiving Head Neck Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OVERVIEW : This single-arm , interventional , supportive care clinical trial patient tumor involve oral cavity , oropharynx , unknown primary expect receive least 50 Gy dose definitive radiation therapy . This generate preliminary data test feasibility , validity clinical usefulness smartphone pain App record report radiation-induced oral mucositis pain . OM PAIN APP ( DESCRIPTION ) : The Oral Mucositis ( OM ) Pain App ( App ) smartphone application design permit patient key pain severity , use visual analog 0-10 scale . The App program alarm prompt patient record pain severity prescribe interval daily spontaneous patient input . Data collect patient 's smartphone back wirelessly central server data analyze remotely data viewed device . The software capable generate time-weighted measure pain , total area pain cure ( AUC ) , summary measure integrate serial assessment patient 's pain duration study . DAILY INTERVENTION : Subjects receive preprogrammed alarm four time day smartphones prompt directly enter OM pain level device . Patients may submit many pain entry wish beyond four minimum level . Data record commence radiation start . Because symptom mucositis commence typically third week radiation therapy , sooner week 2 , recording week 1 use baseline data . Recording data cease four week end radiation therapy time mucositis symptom typically start resolve pain symptom substantially abate . ACCELEROMETER : Each patient issue accelerometer encourage wear continuously study period . To help determine whether decline physical activity associate severity pain , physical activity assess directly accelerometer ( activity monitor ) . Participants wear accelerometerduring sleep waking hour , bathing , start one week prior start radiation therapy . Accelerometer output data obtain 1-minute epoch sum provide raw daily average activity unit , subsequently divide 1000 clarity . Data sync weekly study coordinator computer connect central server .</detailed_description>
