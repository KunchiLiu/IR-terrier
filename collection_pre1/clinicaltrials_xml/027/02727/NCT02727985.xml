	<brief_title>Opioid Reduction Following Spinal Cord Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Neuromodulation clinic Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region currently provide service 501 patient 266 spinal cord stimulation ( SCS ) case . There average 30 new SCS case per year majority implant unilateral bilateral leg pain without low back pain . All patient do via two-step process consist initial trial externalize electrode 1-2 week trial period . At end trial period , successful , patient undergoes internalization procedure . Our goal trial period achieve pain reduction 50 % . Our mean success rate trial implant approximately 80 % . After internalization procedure , patient instruct slowly begin wean pain medication . There scant data discuss effect SCS system medication use particularly , opioids . To date , pain medication weaning largely left discretion patient formalized system oversight . This result poor rate reduction opioid consumption spite improve pain relief achieve SCS . In addition , patient successful SCS trial move permanent implant , break dependence opioids ? Some patient good relationship family physician rely him/her help wean opioids . Others feel manage weaning ( self-management ) . As intensity pain improves along quality life , pain medication consumption decrease tandem without jeopardize pain control . However , lack adherence patient family physician would interfere process . The current standard care patient family physician decide best wean process . The investigator propose multidisciplinary Neuromodulation team dedicate pharmacist draw patient specific wean schedule follow patient closely would effectively reduce opioid consumption patient ( self-management ) family physician-aided wean alone Importance Study Chronic pain estimate cost Canadian health care system $ 6 billion per year accord Canadian Pain Society number expect continue rise . SCS system proven cost effective conventional medical management chronic pain patient . Increased use SCS system would help decrease burden health care dollar . In addition , add risk long term opioid use lead issue tolerance , physical dependence potential adverse effect include overdose . Social concern regard opioid divergence inappropriate use must also take account . The goal project strengthen support use SCS provide information effective way decrease opioid use among chronic pain population . Research Purpose Objectives : The primary purpose study compare opioid use post-SCS implant 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month interval patient provide wean schedule Neuromodulation team ( experimental group ) versus wean family doctor ( control group ; standard care ) determine one strategy superior . The secondary objective characterize change opioid use relate pain score , quality life disability baseline follow-up assessment . The investigator examine change opioid-related adverse event medication cost help understand impact opioid wean patient system . The investigator also compare worker 's compensation patient non-worker compensation patient see follow result pattern . The main hypothesis administration patient- specific opioid weaning schedule pain-specific pharmacist produce great reduction opioid use SCS patient post-implant compare self-management/ family physician-assisted weaning schedule . Study Design Population &amp; Setting The study prospective , randomize , partial-crossover design . The estimate study recruitment duration total 2.5 year . Individual patient follow continue 12 month post SCS-implant , total duration 3.5 years.The study take place one site Regina General Hospital Regina , SK . The study initially enroll 150 patient approve consented SCS , currently take opioid medication pain control , willing undergo opioid wean . They also must willing randomized Neuromodulation clinic wean schedule group Self/Family Physician manage wean group . The Self/Family Physician manage wean group experience standard care duration study . At 6-month follow-up , participant control group allow cross experimental group . Patient Screening : Patients screen eligibility consent SCS procedure . Screening do study coordinator ( Neuromodulation clinic staff ) regular schedule appointment clinic . Once participant meet inclusion/exclusion criterion study , approach study coordinator inform consent . Once consent provide , participant ask complete baseline assessment medication use , pain , quality life , disability sleep pattern . ( see section 6.0 ) . A letter send patient 's family physician inform him/her patient participate study . If experimental group , physician inform patient follow opioid wean schedule develop follow Neuromodulation clinic . For control group , physician informed study , hypothesis patient allocation group conceal bias standard care wean control group . Randomization After consent obtain prior SCS implantation , participant randomly assign experimental control group use computerized random number generator allocate patient 1:1 ratio experimental group ( Neuromodulation clinic wean schedule ) control group ( Self/Family physician wean schedule ) . The randomization sequence table generate biostatistician Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region ( RQHR ) . The group allocation patient send study coordinator seal , opaque sequentially number envelope open patient enrol study . At time , feasible randomly assign patient self-management wean family physician , therefore investigator compare experimental group standard care . If possible , investigator perform subgroup analysis see difference self-management family physician weaning individual . Blinding The surgeon Neuromodulation clinic pharmacist blind allocation patient experimental control group . Any updates schedule require patient experimental group perform Neuromodulation clinic pharmacist . As part current routine care , pharmacist sometimes modify patient 's schedule . The patient wo n't directly identify study participant . The patient blind direct interaction wean schedule physician . The family physician patient experimental group blind , ask allow Neuromodulation clinic handle opioid wean . The physician control group tell patient 's allocation may guess group true blinding . Participants ask disclose study group interact Neuromodulation clinic pharmacist . The statistician analyzing data blind group allocation initial analyse complete . Neuromodulation Clinic Weaning Schedule &amp; Amendments The Neuromodulation clinic pharmacist develop weaning schedule patient enrol study ensure bias generation schedule experimental group . However , schedule give control participant . Schedules individualize take account amount opioid , duration opioid use , adjunctive medication , specific variable related patient . Amendments schedule occur follow . Amendments write submit Neuromodulation nurse blind . Only patient experimental group amendment forward physician . Sample size Approximately 50 patient per year refer either spinal cord peripheral SCS implant RQHR . The investigator plan approach patient meet inclusion/exclusion criterion period 2.5 year enroll 150 patient expect attrition rate 20 % internalization period 20 % follow-up , leave final sample 100 patient analysis.Based minimally clinically significant effect , observe reduction number opioid medication baseline 6-month follow-up , sample size 100 patient would sufficient detect mean difference 2 medication standard deviation 5 80 % power . To detect 20 % increase experimental group proportion patient reach 30 % reduction opioid dose baseline 6 month follow-up compare control group , least 93 participant would need 80 % power .</detailed_description>
