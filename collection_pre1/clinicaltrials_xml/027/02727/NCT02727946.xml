	<brief_title>Tissue Perfusion Indices Predictor Outcome Poly Trauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Poly trauma patient high incidence mortality morbidity spite improvement advance facility . However , doubt early resuscitation intervention make big difference upon overall outcome . A lot method , index , laboratory biomarkers utilized evaluate progress quality resuscitation early hospital intervention group critically ill patient include central venous pressure , urine output , mixed venous oxygen saturation , gastric tonometry . Most recent mean focus upon regional tissue perfusion rather global , however research try difference arterial venous CO2 , oxygen tension content ( Pv -a co2 &amp; Pa -v O2 ) addition dynamic change lactate ( 3 ) predictor tissue perfusion sepsis patient establishment sepsis campaign ( bundle ) .</detailed_description>
