	<detailed_description>Several French study crizotinib conduct recent year . These patient treat PROFILE 1005 1007 clinical study also patient treat crizotinib name patient ATU follow cohort ATU ( Expended Access Cohort ) . Under ATU program accord ATU regulation , limited set data collect furthermore follow stop soon ATU program close . Thus possible access long term data post progression data . Our project collect data patient ATU program ( name patient cohort ) possible patient treat marketing crizotinib , , crizotinib therapy . Centers select observational study IFCT network take part ATU program . This allow accurate analysis crizotinib therapy `` real life '' condition . It emphasize information generally neither available clinical trial ATU program .</detailed_description>
