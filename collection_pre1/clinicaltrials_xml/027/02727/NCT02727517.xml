	<brief_title>Early Late Cord Clamping Depressed Neonate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At time birth , infant still attach placenta via umbilical cord . The infant usually separate placenta clamp cord two clamp . Early cord clamp generally advise carry first 30 second birth , regardless whether cord pulsation cease . However , argument early cord clamp include reduction amount placental transfusion associate benefit extra blood volume , delay clamp allows time transfer fetal blood placenta infant time birth . The study evaluate effect early versus delay cord clamp low-income set child spontaneously start breathe . The randomized controlled trial carry Paropakar Maternity Women 's Hospital ( PMWH ) Kathmandu . The trial fill several important gap relation early delay cord clamp result .</detailed_description>
