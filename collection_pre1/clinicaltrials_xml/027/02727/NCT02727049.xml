	<brief_summary>The purpose research : 1. determine normal exist dynamic biomechanics college athletes 2. test effectiveness osteopathic manipulative medicine treatment athletic injury . Motion capture use Vicon system allow researcher quantify characteristic body range motion hip shoulder athletic technique kick shoot basketball basket . The quantified information use well understand human mobility performance . Osteopathic manipulative medicine ( OMM ) manual medicine apply joint , muscle , connective tissue goal improve body function . Research demonstrate effectiveness OMM musculoskeletal associate connective tissue system health include , among others , prospective clinical trial OMM treatment neck pain , low back pain , acute first- second-degree ankle sprain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Motion Capture Analysis NYIT Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volunteers study recruit Athletic director , coach , physician announcement make verbally via email . The motion capture perform Matthew Cornelius , MS use Vicon Bonita Motion Capture system Fine Arts Department NYIT . Following motion capture , body biomechanics analyze determine range motion joint sagittal , frontal , horizontal plane well time sequence movement . The motion analysis compare Sports Physical exam , include general , structural/neuromusculoskeletal , central neurological ( ImPACT ) exam . The comparison add validity physical exam . In addition , determine quantitative , 3-dimensional motion analysis correlate information physical exam regard restriction motion may useful athlete optimize ability future . If course athlete 's training competition season s/he sustain injury , s/he evaluate NYIT athletics physician , randomly assign injured athletes either 'standard care without OMM ' 'standard care OMM ' cohort medically appropriate . OMM perform NYITCOM physician specialize family medicine OMT neuromusculoskeletal system OMM . `` Return play ' time post-intervention/post-control quantitative motion analysis biomechanics athletes demonstration athletic maneuver injury .</detailed_description>
