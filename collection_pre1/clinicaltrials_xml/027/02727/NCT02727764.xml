	<detailed_description>DMARDs methotrexate , sulfasalazine leflunomide use alone combination , consider standard treatment RA may combine conventional DMARDs and/or corticosteroid and/or anti-inflammatory centrally work analgetics ( NSAIDS ) . During last decade , treatment biological ( e.g . TNF-inhibitors ) , together improve timing dose conventional therapy , significantly improve outcome significant proportion RA patient . The advent biologicals implementation intensive treatment protocol significantly improve outcome significant proportion RA patient prevent disability . However , drug-free remission still rare hence RA patient require continued immunosuppressive treatment predisposes potentially serious infection . Also 50 % RA patient continue suffer symptomatic disease . Intra-articular glucocorticoid often use patient , e.g . single joint inflame . The duration effect however variable . It regularly occur clinical practice reasonable clinical remission rheumatoid arthritis patient achieve current treatment option , one joint still display persistent sign inflammation inflammation joint greatly reduce . This mean joint ( ) still affect active inflammation therapy require . There thus large unmet need additional RA therapy good tolerability efficacy profile use patient eligible standard treatment , despite standard treatment suffer inflamed joint . Local gene therapy IFN-β could potential treatment fulfil unmet need ; preclinical study consistently suggest IFN-β anti-inflammatory bone protective effect arthritis . ART-I02 investigational new drug , express human IFN-β recombinant ( r ) adeno-associated virus type 5 ( rAAV5 ) β influence promoter , induce inflammatory stimulus . Due relapse nature RA , therapeutic expression maximal flare-ups disease . This achieve employ NF-kB responsive promotor regulate expression IFN-β . Under inflammatory condition , NF-kB responsive promoter activate synovium upregulate expression hIFN-β turn remission . In way , transgene expression control , follow intermittent course disease . In phase I open label , dose escalate study safety single intra-articular ART-I02 injection patient RA active arthritis metacarpophalangeal ( MCP ) , proximal interphalangeal ( PIP ) , distal interphalangeal ( DIP ) joint indication surgical intervention include removal synovium.. In two-phase stagger dose escalation design , dose start low dose ( 1.2x1012 vg/ MCP joint , 0.6x1012 vg/ PIP joint 0.3x1012 vg/ DIP joint ) progress high dose 1.2x1013 vg/ MCP joint , 0.6x1013 vg/ PIP joint 0.3x1013 vg/ DIP joint . Three patient enrol two dose level . Enrolment subject within two cohort proceed safety data day 7 previous subject reviewed/evaluated investigator . After dose last subject cohort I II , dose pause two week include allow assessment safety data Data Review Committee . All available safety data include minimum 2 week data ( safety tolerability data day 14 post ART-I02 administration ) 3rd patient cohort I II ( medical history , vital sign , physical examination , laboratory parameter , ECG adverse event ) review . Only thorough assessment safety data enrolment next cohort continue . In cohort III six patient administer high safety dose ART-I02 determine previous dose escalate cohort ( cohort I II ) . Cohort III add study substantiate safety profile high tolerate dose ART-I02 . Subjects follow 24 week single intra-articular injection ART-I02 safety . Although study design demonstrate clinical effect , ( clinical ) efficacy parameter evaluate . After period subject include long term follow-up study another 4.5 year assess long term safety . The consideration treat one joint clinical study provide opportunity examine administration single dose site promoter activate therapeutic protein IFN-β require . Patients indication surgical intervention affect target joint , include removal synovium , recruit study . With approach possible benefit patient obtain ( postpone surgical intervention ) , time provide opportunity mitigate risk cause untoward effect due persistence vector ( planned surgical intervention carry early ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion Female subject ( age ≥18 year ) must either surgically sterile ( mean hysterectomy /or bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal least one year ( define amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive month without another cause , confirm follicle stimulate hormone level &gt; 35 mIU/mL . Subject diagnose RA accord 2010 American College Rheumatology/ European league rheumatism ( ACR/EULAR ) criterion classification RA . Inflammation MCP , PIP DIP joint due active RA confirm MRI . Written informed consent , able willing comply requirement study protocol . Judged general good health , opinion investigator , clinically significant relevant abnormality medical history , abnormalities physical examination , vital sign , electrocardiography ( ECG ) laboratory safety test , perform screen visit and/or prior administration ARTI02 . Arthrodesis joint replacement target wrist prior inclusion . Hypersensitivity natural recombinant hIFNβ , excipients . Contraindication intraarticular treatment . Presence neutralize antibody ( Nab ) titer adenoassociated virus type 5 ( AAV5 ) and/or hIFNβ . Active infectious disease nature , include clinical active viral infection . Received AAV 5 vector previously . Poor functional status , define bedbound wheelchairbound . Participation investigational drug device study within 90 day prior screen 4 time per year . Positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , hepatitis C antibodies hepatitis B surface antigen . Positive antidoublestranded DNA antibody ( dsDNA ) . History liver function abnormality require treatment , drug induce liver injury , chronic liver disease , excessive alcohol consumption chronic alcohol induce disease . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN . If subject AST ALT &gt; 2 x ULN &lt; 2.5 x ULN , reassessment allow investigator 's discretion , within 18 day period Visit 1 2 . Severely impaired renal function ( estimate glomerular filtration rate ≤ 30 mL/min accord CockcroftGault formula ) . Subject major surgery , donate lose approximately 500 mL blood within 3 month prior screen visit Mental condition render subject unable understand nature , scope possible consequence study and/or evidence uncooperative attitude Investigator concern regard safe participation subject trial reason : investigator considers subject inappropriate participation trial . Serious medical disease , severe liver kidney disease , uncompensated congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within six month , unstable angina , uncontrolled hypertension , severe pulmonary disease active asthma , demyelinate neurological disease , depression history depression , history seizure epilepsy , uncontrolled epilepsy , history cancer ( cutaneous basal squamous cell carcinoma cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ) less five year documentation diseasefree state , recurrent opportunistic infection concurrent medical condition , opinion investigator , would make subject unsuitable study .</criteria>
