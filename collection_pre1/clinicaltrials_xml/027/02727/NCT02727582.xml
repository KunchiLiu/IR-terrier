	<brief_summary>Multidrug-resistant ( MDR ) tuberculosis ( TB ) , define simultaneous resistance isoniazid rifampin , declare global emergency . Treatment outcomes poor , driven toxicity limit efficacy 2nd-line anti-TB drug . Although evidence anti-TB activity toxicity key drug relate drug exposure , pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic ( PK/PD ) relationships patient MDR-TB poorly characterize . Moreover potential synergy drug combination identify context MDR-TB , dose take account concentration need suppress resistance , role minimum inhibitory concentration ( MICs ) dose poorly study . There therefore opportunity optimize drug dos combination improve efficacy , reduce toxicity . Based observational study patient standard treatment MDR-TB , proposal build novel methodology develop , largely drug sensitive TB : 1 . The application computational analytical technique tease individual contribution anti-TB drug use combination 2 . The development treatment response biomarker model base time-to-positivity liquid culture serial sputum sample . 3 . The vitro determination PK target anti-TB activity suppression resistance use hollow fiber model Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) ( HFM-TB ) . Thus research enhance understand current modality TB treatment , contribute research approach future regimen optimization . This protocol describe clinical research component ( point 1 &amp; 2 ) . Aim 1 : To characterize effect 2nd-line drug exposure treatment response MDR-TB patient . The 2nd-line drug examine comprise standardized regimen use South Africa : kanamycin , pyrazinamide , moxifloxacin , ethionamide terizidone . Hypothesis : Amongst patient standard MDR-TB treatment , variation drug exposure quantifiable impact rate viable Mtb clear sputum . Aim 2 : To identify drug exposure associate risk treatment-related toxicity patient standard 2nd-line regimen MDR-TB . Hypothesis : The risk specific toxicity associate kanamycin , pyrazinamide , moxifloxacin , ethionamide terizidone link drug concentration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : To characterize effect 2nd-line drug exposure treatment response MDR-TB patient . The 2nd-line drug examine comprise standardized regimen use South Africa : kanamycin , pyrazinamide , moxifloxacin , ethionamide terizidone . Hypothesis : Amongst patient standard MDR-TB treatment , variation drug exposure quantifiable impact rate viable Mtb clear sputum . Rationale : There substantial variability PK parameter 2nd-line drug patient , susceptibility individual Mtb isolate drug . Concentration-dependent activity demonstrate moxifloxacin , pyrazinamide aminoglycosides , high dos moxifloxacin pyrazinamide propose . Studies need identify important determinant treatment response describe optimal drug exposure MDR-TB , take MICs account . We describe exponential decline viable Mtb sputum MDR-TB patient treatment response model base time-to-positivity liquid culture , thus further field TB biomarker research . We define relationship PK rate eradication viable Mtb sputum patient standard MDR-TB regimen identify potent drug drive treatment response , identify synergism antagonism individual drug . Examples specific question address include : What impact pyrazinamide resistance treatment response ? ; What impact inhA mutation effect ethionamide ? ; , Should high dos moxifloxacin pyrazinamide consider ? Aim 2 : To identify drug exposure associate risk treatment-related toxicity patient standard 2nd-line regimen MDR-TB . Hypothesis : The risk specific toxicity associate kanamycin , pyrazinamide , moxifloxacin , ethionamide terizidone link drug concentration . Rationale : Treatment limit adverse drug effect common patient MDR-TB treatment regimen . Although several common toxicity link specific drug think dose-related , relationship PK toxicity adequately study . Overlapping toxicity antiretroviral drug HIV-infected patient , amongst risk factor , may contributory . Minimum drug concentration threshold associate increased toxicity would allow optimization dos target concentration toxicity common , optimal efficacy .</detailed_description>
