	<brief_title>Phase II Study TAK228 Relapsed Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If participant find eligible study , begin take capsule TAK-228 28-day cycle . Participant take drug 1 time every day time . Participant take drug cup ( 8 ounce ) water eat light meal . Participant fast 2 hour 1 hour dose . If participant vomit digestive side effect prevent take dose , dose skip . If participant vomit dose , dose retaken . In case , participant wait next day take another dose . In case participant double repeat dose . Participant record vomit dose diary study staff provide . Study Visits : Within 3 day participant start take TAK-228 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw biomarker testing . Biomarkers find blood/tissue may relate participant 's reaction study drug . On Day 1 cycle : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Participant must fast 4 hour blood draw . Some draw use diabetes test . If participant become pregnant , part sample use pregnancy test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw biomarker testing ( Cycles 1 2 ) . - Participant EKG ( within 3 day cycle Cycle 1 ) . On Days 8 22 Cycle 1 , participant physical exam . On Day 15 Cycle 1 : - Participant physical exam - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Within 5 day Day 1 Cycle 3 , every even-numbered cycle ( Cycles 4 , 6 , 8 , ) , participant CT scan , chest x-ray , bone marrow biopsy/aspiration check status disease . If study doctor think participant 's best interest , PET/CT scan every 2 cycle check status disease . Blood Sugar Testing : Participant give glucometer check pre-dose blood sugar level home every day . The study staff teach participant use glucometer abnormal reading look like . Participant must tell study staff right away abnormal reading . The frequency in-home fasting glucose testing may reduce weekly doctor think need . Length Study : Participant may continue receive study drug 12 cycle . Participant longer able take drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Participation study follow-up phone call finish . End-of-Treatment Visits : About 1 week participant stop take study drug : - Participant physical exam - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test test diabetes . This include pregnancy test participant able become pregnant . - Participant EKG . About 2 week participant stop take study drug , CT scan chest x-rays check status disease . If study doctor think need , participant also bone marrow biopsy/aspiration check status disease . Within 2 week participant stop take study drug , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw biomarker testing . This investigational study . TAK-228 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor describe study drug design work . Up 75 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
