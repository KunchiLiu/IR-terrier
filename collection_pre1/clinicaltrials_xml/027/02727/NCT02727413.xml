	<brief_summary>The study aim comparative examination pre- , intra- post-operative release profile inflammatory vasoactive mediator patient undergo heart valve surgery cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) due either infectious endocarditis degenerative valvular heart disease . Specific attention focus distinction mediator release associate infection result CPB . Concomitantly identification characterization infectious pathogen circulation valvular sample carry , together search resistance-coding transcript .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Exaggerated release inflammatory mediator endogenous vasoactive substance result coincident infection surgical stress play role post-operative organ failure alter immune defense , thus contribute unfavorable post-operative outcome . Cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) , even absence IE , show modify cytokine vasoactive mediator release may cause organ failure . Tracing release profile inflammatory cytokine vasoactive mediator correlation postoperative organ dysfunction cardiac surgery IE non-IE patient aims assessment prognostic validity biomarkers evaluation measure pro-active clearance surgical intervention . Induction inflammatory mediator temporal release profile may vary depend involved pathogen , always identify conventional technique ( blood culture ) . Since conceivable identification involve pathogen could explain difference cytokine secretory pattern IE , use advance molecular technology ( NGS ) support clarification relation . Analysis transcript encode inflammatory vasoactive mediator blood cell enable surveillance temporal oscillation profile observation time frame . Transcriptome analysis identify putative pathogen also disclose feature antibiotic resistance .</detailed_description>
