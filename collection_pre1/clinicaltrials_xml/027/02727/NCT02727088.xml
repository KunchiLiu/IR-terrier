	<brief_summary>Epidemiological data show significant rate failure endodontic treatment 20 50 % worldwide , probably directly relate difficulty procedure . A successful pulpotomy allow preservation vital radicular pulp root canal . The presence biological tissue root canal definitely efficient `` complete '' fill inert material . It show animal human study pulp stump contact biomaterial able regenerate dentinal plug , architecture physiologic dentin . Primary objective : To compare success rate root canal treatment ( reference ) conservative treatment ( pulpotomy ) treating inflame dental pulp permanent mature teeth . Secondary objective : ( 1 ) To describe clinical biological prognostic factor two treatment ; ( 2 ) ass additional value biomarkers expression level prognostic tool clinical decision making ( radical vs. conservative treatment ) ; ( 3 ) ass impact treatment post-procedural pain . This trial aim demonstrate non-inferiority conservative pulpal treatment endodontic treatment . Patients consult one seven study center , present one indication retain trial give write informed consent receive treatment ( endodontic treatment conservative treatment ) allocate randomization ( stratified clinical diagnosis pulp status ) . The follow patient include , phone call D15 , visit 1 , 6 , 12 14 post operative month . Clinical examination Xrays 6 , 12 24 month ) use evaluate success failure treatment . During treatment , sample pulp tissue withdrawn transfer molecular biology laboratory analysis inflammation biomarkers . The aim part sudy assess putative relationship ( 1 ) regulation biomarkers expression clinical diagnosis , ( 2 ) regulation biomarkers success rate pulpotomy . Success/failure evaluation : The primary endpoint time necessity endodontic reintervention ( analysed time failure ) . This study use Intention To Treat analysis main assessment ; secondary assessment accounting peroperative conversion assess practical impact conversion . We distinguish - Direct failure ( mean failure directly correlate treatment ) : reintervention need due evolution treat tooth . This include delayed onset desmodontitis , periodontal space enlargement and/or periapical/periradicular radiolucency ( PAI &gt; 2 ) demonstrate infection root canal system ( fill either pulpal stump fill material ) . - Indirect failure ( mean cause failure directly relate endodontic treatment choice ) : event lead endodontic reintervention indication NOT cause radicular infection restoration failure attributable inadequate restoration . For example : new need post-placement treatment loss another tooth , unexpected progression periodontal disease . Both failure modes interest analysis : direct failure time indication intrinsic value therapy , whereas gross ( direct+indirect ) failure time indication clinical relevance ( good therapy applicable rare case may less interesting mediocre widely applicable one ) . Statistical analysis : The classical method descriptive analysis use describe raw result . In order make inference directly possible clinical result , study analyze Bayesian framework . This study design reference frequentist demonstration non-inferiority . A non-inferiority trial first second specie error rate α β operational characteristic superiority ( unilateral trial ) error rate alpha beta , turn need study size comparison ( =bilateral ) trial error rate α 2β . The final plan size trial establish follow : - Ideal plan : nonparametric comparison ( logrank test ) fulfilling goal accord plan need 158 patient overall `` perfect information '' assumption ( loss follow-up , single analysis ) - Loss follow-up : expect loss follow-up cause 22 % include patient drop study final analysis lead include 194 patient overall . Sequential analysis : since wish able follow progress study , interrupt main goal reach , choose use sequential analysis . A Pocock scheme need increase sample size 16 % , leading plan recruit 226 patient overall .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulpotomy vs Pulpectomy Outcome .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The accepted management pulpal intervention vital dental pulp pulpectomy ( ablation whole dental pulp , preparation fill whole root canal system , difficult invasive ) . However , show radicular pulp reparative potential interesting immune defence property . A pulp chamber pulpotomy ( ablation coronal part pulp , easy less invasive ) may therefore good alternative . Its feasibility , know decidual immature permanent teeth ( routine treatment ) show mature permanent teeth . We aim prove non-inferiority pulpectomy study prognostic factor . Primary objective primary endpoint : To compare success rate root canal treatment ( i.e . pulpectomy , reference treatment ) conservative treatment ( pulpotomy ) treat dental pulpal inflammatory disease permanent teeth , assessed time indication re-treatment ( time-to-failure ) ( primary endpoint ) . The investigator charge patient propose classification failure , must validate adjudication committee . Secondary objective endpoint : 1 . To assess impact treatment post-procedural pain ; 2 . To describe clinical prognostic factor two treatment ; 3 . To assess additional value biomarkers expression level prognostic tool clinical decision making ( pulpectomy vs. pulpotomy ) . Study design : Prospective , comparative , randomize study ( randomized clinical trial ) Study population : Adult patient indication pulpal intervention permanent mature non-necrosed tooth . Adjudication committee : The adjudication committee review classification failure patient , basis data radiographs necessary submit query send investigator . The adjudication committee finally classify failure direct indirect . Sample size Power consideration : Maximum 226 patient , base analogy frequentist analysis : - non-inferiority study , α =0.05 , 1- β =0.8 ; - expect rate failure control group : 10 % /year ; - maximal inferiority margin : hazard ratio=2 ; - two year accrual , one year follow-up ; - patient follow end study ; - expect loss follow-up 10 % /year : - loss power due interval censorship clinically silent failure : negligible ; - sequential analysis ( Pocock scheme , final test final critical p=0.03 ) . Statistical analysis : Bayesian analysis , analogous frequentist non inferiority study ( RRmin=2 ) α=0.05 β=0.2 Bayesian model survival retreatment indication-free , assess : - Intergroup difference ( Cox proportional hazard model applicable , parametric model otherwise ) - Covariates impact ( regression model ) Assessment predictive value ( clinical biological ) covariates .</detailed_description>
