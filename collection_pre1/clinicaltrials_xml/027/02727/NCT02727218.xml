	<brief_title>Safety Early Removal Chest Tubes After Thoracoscopic Lung Biopsies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Presence chest tube post thoracoscopic surgery associate increased morbidity like wound infection , pain , prolong hospital admission Corse , hand , early chest tube removal associate increase need recurrent active intervention like pleural tap re-accumulated pleural effusion . Method : randomize prospective study include 60 patient underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy/segmentectomy/ thoracoscopic mediastinal biopsy . The study exclude patient difficult operative course ( intraoperative finding significant adhesions/ intraoperative injury lung parenchyma/ intraoperative bleeding/failure extubation ) patient post operative finding ( bleed chest tube 100 ml first hour , persistent air leak , non expand lung chest x-ray ) The patient divide two group , first group - 30 patient - undergo chest tube removal three hour , second group undergo chest tube removal accord treat department protocol . All patient evaluate regard pain level - subjective objective - , admission period , infection , need invasive intervention . The patient evaluated admission , one week two week .</detailed_description>
