	<brief_summary>Delayed post-operative hyponatremia occur 5-20 % patient follow pituitary surgery typically occur post-operative day 5-10.This decline sodium occur rapidly serious consequence alter mental status , seizure , coma , even death . Despite significant research patient demographic risk factor , investigator able predict patient suffer delay post-operative hyponatremia date . At Barrow Neurological Institute , physicians currently utilize outpatient screen protocol monitor patient ' sodium level surgery , yet effective reduce readmission follow pituitary surgery . The etiology delay post-operative hyponatremia link water sodium dysregulation post-operative period . It show post-operative day 1-2 sodium level statistically low patient develop delay hyponatremia , however , numerical difference large enough guide clinical management . The investigator propose water load post-operative day 1 may expose underlie sodium/water dysregulation early post-operative period . This would improve physician ' understand pathophysiology post-operative hyponatremia , may help serve screen tool patient future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post-Operative Water Load Following Transsphenoidal Pituitary Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current standard screen post-operative transsphenoidal pituitary patient sodium abnormality POD ( post-operative day ) 7-14 window . At Barrow Neurological Institute , physician institute universal screen protocol post-operative patient wherein patient serum sodium level draw POD5-7 attempt make manage mild moderate hyponatremia outpatient basis.This screen protocol effectively identify delay post-operative hyponatremia , however , yet reduce readmission hyponatremia patient . The researcher propose implementing water load test POD1 may facilitate outpatient screen three way : 1 ) The water load may identify subset patient appropriate water sodium regulation surgery require close monitoring outpatient sodium level . 2 ) The water load may identify subset patient risk delay hyponatremia would benefit strict counsel closer outpatient monitoring . 3 ) The water load may identify subset patient moderate severe reduction serum sodium response water load , patient may benefit monitoring hospital prior discharge . If scenario hold true , may change way physician monitor treat patient follow transsphenoidal surgery future . Furthermore , protocol could readily expand neurosurgery practice could facilitate care future patient undergo transsphenoidal pituitary surgery .</detailed_description>
