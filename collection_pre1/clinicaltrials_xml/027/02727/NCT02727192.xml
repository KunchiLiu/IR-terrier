	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common cardiac rhythm disturbance adult , prevalence expect rise significantly come decade . The occurrence AF associate significantly increase mortality well morbidity cerebrovascular accident important . Unfortunately treatment option remain limited . Anti-arrhythmic drug widely use limited efficacy potential toxicity adverse event recognize . Recent year 's catheter ablation AF continue gain acceptance symptomatic treatment , recurrence rate high need continuous medication . Thus need good understand cause development trigger episodes AF well introduce new treatment option . Cardiometabolic factor obesity , inactivity sleep apnea ( SA ) therefore gained interest . Many patient AF chronic sleep apnea , present study want explore interaction SA AF . The hypothesis present study SA may trigger AF treatment SA reduce overall burden AF well reduce recurrence AF pulmonary vein ablation . To test hypothesis implant Reveal device continuously record heart rhythm 100 patient paroxysmal AF concomitant SA . Initially influence SA onset AF examine , patient randomize treatment SA influence total AF burden record ablation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For present project establish research team 2 different university hospital . This team , include high rank , internationally renowned scientist clinical basic science , make framework PhD candidate ensure patient cohort . Patients paroxysmal AF SA examine extensive diagnostic battery include advanced cardiac imaging tool allow proper description heart . Then Reveal continuously monitor rhythm heart insert , allow influence SA , physical activity , inflammatory parameter , external variable total AF burden examine . The patient randomize treatment SA CPAP , AF burden record 5 month ablation 6 month . The present investigation carry , expect result well understanding interaction AF SA may lay scientific basis well diagnostic therapeutic approach patient AF . In addition , give advantage continuous RevealÂ® record patient 's heart rhythm , present study examine possible trigger AF activity level inflammatory substance , examine role structural abnormality heart assess echocardiography MRI trigger AF episode . An overall aim therefore well phenotyping patient could aid person-specific treatment approach , direct consequence individual patient society .</detailed_description>
