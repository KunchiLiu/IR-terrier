	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Assess Safety , Tolerability Efficacy Xanamem™ Subjects With Mild Dementia Due AD ( XanADu )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , randomise , multi-centre , double-blind , placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study ass safety , tolerability efficacy oral Xanamem™ daily adult subject mild dementia due AD . Based Xanamem™ 's mode action hippocampal function , amnestic symptom may respond best , thus favour inclusion mild dementia due AD , give evidence disease progression . Subjects treat double-blind fashion , investigator subject unaware treatment assignment , minimise subjective unrecognised bias carry investigator subject . Placebo use comparator study . In study , Xanamem™ administer conjunction current standard therapy . It plan randomise approximately 174 subject approximately 20 study site three country ( Australia , United Kingdom , United States ) , aim enrol 7 10 subject study site . Subject enrolment competitive cap 18 subject per study site establish avoid site effect . In case sample composition one study site create concern , enrolment stop also occur few 18 subject . The data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) periodically meet review accumulate safety study data . At Baseline visit ( Week 0 ) , eligible subject randomise 1:1 ratio receive either Xanamem™ administer orally QD ( treatment group ) match placebo ( placebo group ) . Subjects return study site visit Week 4 Week 8 , End Treatment ( Week 12 ) Follow-up ( 4 week post last dose study drug ) visit , study assessment perform . Ad hoc telephone contact may also occur time-point throughout study , deem necessary investigator/study nurse , subject wish report AE . Subjects interview examine study site visit , complete variety questionnaire routine safety evaluation . Optional PD sample perform specific visit . Subjects provide consent optional sub-study still eligible main study . The overall study duration individual subject 17 20 week , include screen period one 4 week , double-blind treatment period 12 week , follow-up period 4 week . The total duration study expect 2 year .</detailed_description>
