	<brief_summary>GSK3179106 potent relatively selective inhibitor RET kinase design safe effective therapy irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) patient . This randomized , double-blind ( sponsor unblind ) , placebo-controlled , dose escalating , four period , single-dose crossover , first time human study ass safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics GSK3179106 normal healthy subject . The study compose 2 cohort , screen ( 21 day prior first dose study drug ) , Treatment , follow-up period ( 7-10 day last dose [ Day 1 dose period 4 ] ) . The Treatment period include 4 dose period . Subjects participate either Cohort 1 Cohort 2 . The total duration study subject approximately 10 week . A sufficient number healthy subject screen enrol 16 subject complete plan study procedure . Each dose period stagger 2 8 subject administer study drug initially . Once 24 hour ( h ) elapse , provide safety concern , remainder subject schedule dosing period may dose . A review safety tolerability occur prior administration next dose level . This procedure follow escalate dose period . Subjects assign Cohort 1 participate 1 placebo 3 dose escalate period . Subjects assign Cohort 2 participate 4 dose period include 2 escalate dos placebo Periods 1 2 , pilot food effect Periods 3 4 . Within cohort , subject return next scheduled dosing period approximately 14 day administration study drug prior dose period . Cohort 2 proceed completion treatment period Cohort 1 . Each subject enrol one cohort . The plan dose range 10 milligram ( mg ) 200 mg Cohort 1 . The actual dos administer may adjust base safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic data previous dose level ; dose adjustment may involve either increase decrease plan dose Cohorts 1 2 . There formal hypothesis test study .</brief_summary>
