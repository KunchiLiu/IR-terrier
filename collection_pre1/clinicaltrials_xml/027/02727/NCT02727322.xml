	<brief_summary>The specific aim randomize double-blind placebo-controlled trial determine extend release nitrofurantoin antibiotic prophylaxis decrease incidence symptomatic urinary tract infection ( UTI ) compare placebo patient undergo short term indwell clean intermittent self-catheterization ( CISC ) acute postoperative urinary retention follow pelvic organ prolapse and/or urinary incontinence surgery . Consented patient undergo urogenital surgery fail post-operative void trial randomize either extended release nitrofurantoin 100mg identical appear placebo capsule take daily perform CISC indwell catheter place . The primary outcome symptomatic culture confirm UTI within six week surgery . Secondary outcome include adverse event associate nitrofurantoin use , incidence nitrofurantoin-resistant isolates urine culture symptomatic woman . Primary secondary outcome evaluate Student test chi square Fisher exact test appropriate . Assuming decrease symptomatic UTIs attributable nitrofurantoin prophylaxis 33 % 13 % , 80 % power , two-sided alpha 0.05 , 10 % dropout rate , recruit total 154 patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitrofurantoin Prophylaxis During Catheter-managed Acute Urinary Retention After Pelvic Reconstructive Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary tract infection ( UTI ) occur frequently follow surgery urinary incontinence pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) , report incidence 48 % . This high rate frequently attribute intraoperative factor , manipulation genitourinary tract instrumentation bladder urethra , well approximately 50 % rate short term postoperative catheterization follow urogynecologic surgery . As American woman 20 % lifetime risk surgery POP urinary incontinence , absolute number woman risk urinary infectious morbidity associate procedure quite high . The substantial risk UTI follow POP incontinence surgery , combine well-established risk associate catheterization , lead many practitioner prescribe oral antibiotic woman undergo catheterization postoperative period . However , minimal Level I evidence support refute practice . The Infectious Disease Society America ( IDSA ) Guideline acknowledge prophylactic antibiotic show reduce UTI rate among patient use short term postoperative catheterization randomize trial . However , recommend routine antibiotic prophylaxis use due concern regard anti-microbial resistance , cost , potential adverse effect , even among high risk group include woman undergo urogynecologic surgery . This recommendation base expert opinion , give paucity trial data guide clinical care . Nitrofurantoin commonly use antibiotic UTI prophylaxis catheterization , well-tolerated adverse effect , know low rate associate resistance . After decade use , remain active common UTI pathogen gain resistance antimicrobial . For example , 2013 Magee-Womens Hospital Adult Antibiogram , 98 % E-coli specimen sensitive Nitrofurantoin , consistent since least 2007 . The drug half-life 20 minute 40 % concentrate excreted urine therapeutically unchanged form . Thus minimal impact vaginal bowel flora . Nitrofurantoin show reduce incidence positive urine culture symptomatic UTIs woman suprapubic catheter pelvic organ prolapse and/or urinary incontinence surgery . No trial evaluate nitrofurantoin prophylaxis woman use short term indwell catheter CISC follow urogynecologic procedure . Given large number woman risk urinary infectious morbidity associate short term catheterization acute urinary retention follow POP and/or incontinence surgery , paucity data impact antibiotic prophylaxis setting , propose demonstrate efficacy nitrofurantoin prophylaxis adequately-powered , placebo-controlled trial . Secondary outcome include adverse event associate nitrofurantoin use , incidence nitrofurantoin resistant bacterial isolates urine culture . Primary Aim : To determine extended release nitrofurantoin administer daily patient use indwell clean intermittent self-catheterization ( CISC ) pelvic organ prolapse and/or urinary incontinence surgery decrease incidence symptomatic culture prove urinary tract infection ( UTI ) compare placebo randomize , double-blind trial . Secondary Aim ( ) : To determine nitrofurantoin antibiotic prophylaxis administer patient use indwell catheter CISC pelvic organ prolapse and/or urinary incontinence surgery affect frequency adverse event related daily nitrofurantoin exposure , frequency urine culture positive nitrofurantoin-resistant isolates . The Null Hypotheses : Nitrofurantoin antibiotic prophylaxis administer patient use indwell catheter CISC pelvic organ prolapse and/or urinary incontinence surgery change incidence symptomatic culture prove urinary tract infection ( UTI ) compare placebo .</detailed_description>
