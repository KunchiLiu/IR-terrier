	<brief_summary>Background : Dysautonomia refers abnormal function autonomic nervous system include sympathetic parasympathetic nervous system . Diabetes mellitus cause secondary dysautonomias ( 1 ) . The Survey Autonomic Symptoms ( SAS ) simple validated tool ass presence severity autonomic symptom ( 2 ) . Diabetic patient also suffer chronic neuropathic pain . After amputation surgery , 78 % patient may develop post surgical neuropathic pain ( 3 ) . The self-report version Leeds Assessment Neuropathic Symptoms Signs pain scale ( S-LANSS ) validate diagnostic tool ass patient neuropathic pain ( 4 ) . This scale use ass change pain experienced diabetic foot surgery . Currently , spinal anaesthesia ( SAB ) ultrasound guide femoral sciatic peripheral nerve block ( FSNB ) acceptable anaesthesia dysautonomic diabetic patient diabetic foot ulcer go wound debridement , Ray 's amputation knee amputation ( 5 ) Many study compare multiple perioperative parameter patient undergo low limb surgery peripheral nerve block versus spinal anaesthesia . These parameter include preparation time , anaesthetic complication ( e.g . hypotension , nausea vomiting , post-dural puncture headache , urinary retention ) , patient satisfaction postoperative pain control ( 6,7,8 ) . The investigator want study patient dysautonomia different haemodynamic response spinal anaesthesia peripheral nerve blockade change compare patient normal autonomic function . Secondarily , investigator would also study difference post operative pain control well incidence chronic pain patient receive spinal anaesthesia versus peripheral nerve blockade .</brief_summary>
