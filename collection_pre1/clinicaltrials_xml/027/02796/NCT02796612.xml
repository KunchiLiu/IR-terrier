	<brief_title>Empathy Standard Diagnostic Procedures Outpatient Breast Clinic Might Not Enough</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The fact breast biopsy take due suspect breast cancer emotionally exceptional situation threat diagnose cancer also breast perceived symbol womanhood , sexuality motherhood . Time , however , scarce busy outpatient set . Nevertheless doctor nurse outpatient breast clinic University Hospital Basel empathetic try address anxiety give emotional support , , necessary breast biopsy . Study finding , however suggest , level anxiety , pain discomfort associate breast biopsy considerable , might sufficiently control empathy alone might reduce give structured standardize information . The investigator hypothesize plan intervention reduces level anxiety patient go breast biopsy thus superior current standard diagnostic procedure . The project focus improve patient ' knowledge procedure breast biopsy meeting emotional need reduce anxiety relate biopsy give structure standardized information . Additionally project investigate whether patient diagnose breast cancer high level anxiety patient benign breast disease . Furthermore study assess precisely physician , perform biopsy , appraise patient ' perception anxiety , pain satisfaction relate breast biopsy . The primary objective demonstrate intervention reduce patient ' anxiety compare standard care . The intervention consist ( 1 ) hand take-home brochure patient well ( 2 ) providing structure standardized information biopsy physician performs biopsy underwent psychological training purpose . Secondary objective : Does intervention reduce anxiety biopsy ? Is correlation level anxiety histological diagnosis breast cancer ? Does wait time procedure histological diagnosis influence level anxiety ? How patient 's perception pain biopsy ? Is correlation patient 's perception pain anxiety physician ' impression patient 's perception ? Is patient satisfied additional take-home brochure / structure standardized information give ? This prospective study evaluate anxiety implementation structure intervention reduce anxiety relate breast biopsy . Eligible woman speak understand German need skin biopsy , core biopsy vacuum assist biopsy . Women receive fine needle aspiration , examination pathologic nipple secretion , abscess evacuation exclude . Women understand speak German language exclude . Demographics relevant baseline variable summarize group patient . Categorical data present frequency percentage . For continuous variable , low upper quartile well median present . Baseline characteristic two group compare use proportion test categorical variable Welch two-sample t-test continuous variable . Anxiety patient measure four point time State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) : biopsy well communication diagnosis . The difference STAI score patient receive standard care patient intervention compare use Wilcoxon 's rank sum test ( Mann-Whitney test ) significance level α = 0.05 . The result questionnaire report estimate together 95 % confidence interval . Secondary objective assess use non-parametric test appropriate . Sample size estimate able detect significant difference anxiety measure State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) score ( Spielberger , Consulting Psychologists Press ( CPP ) 1983 ) group receive standard care intervention group . In recent study , Flory et al . ( Flory Lang ) report mean STAI score 48 point breast biopsy patient use simulate data control group . By assume effect size 5 score point , mean score 43 point use patient intervention . The score group assume normally distribute standard deviation 11.9 . Sample size calculate semi-parametric resampling method . Each sample size ni , evaluate simulate R=999 time ni individual patient distribution . The score two group compare use Wilcoxon 's signed-rank test significance level α = 0.05 . Sample size set ensure least power , 1 − β , 0.9 . For study , totally 334 patient recruited ensure 250 evaluable patient consider drop-out rate 25 % .</detailed_description>
