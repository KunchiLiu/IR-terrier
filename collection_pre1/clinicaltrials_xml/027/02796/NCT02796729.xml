	<brief_summary>This project compare two MRI contrast agent metastatic brain tumour human . More specifically , investigator compare tumour contrast obtain use glucose versus current standard gadolinium-based contrast agent ( GBCA , gadobutrol , trade name Gadovist , use ) . First , participant receive glucose bolus injection follow glucose enhanced MRI . Second , participant receive Gd-DTPA bolus injection follow Gd-DTPA enhance MRI . Both contrast study perform MRI study , one hour long .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : To quantitatively compare glucose-enhanced MRI current standard GBCA enhance MRI participant metastatic brain tumour prior receive radiotherapy British Columbia Cancer Agency Vancouver Cancer Centre . Hypotheses : 1 ) Glucose enhance MRI highlight malignant metastatic brain tumour comparable contrast noise compare GBCA 2 ) Glucose enhancement brain tumour offer unique complementary information , compare GBCA enhance MRIs . Justification : The current standard MRI contrast agent metastatic brain tumour , GBCA , limit low specificity since GBCA accumulate region disrupt blood brain barrier due cancer well radiation necrosis pseudo-progression radiotherapy . It important radiation oncologists reliably identify recurrent cancer , necrosis post-treatment inflammation ; GBCA allow . Therefore , clinical need exist MRI technique offer improve specificity characterization metastatic brain tumour therapy . Glucose enhance MRI represent new technique could offer improved specificity detect metastatic brain tumour . Justification number participant include : The magnitude signal enhancement expect vary participant 1 ) metastatic brain tumour exhibit variety enhancement pattern include ring , solid nodular 2 ) metastatic brain tumour range size . Therefore , 20 participant consider sufficient provide reasonably accurate estimation expect mean tumour contrast well expect variance tumour contrast future clinical trial . One additional healthy participant include study perform 'test-run ' complicate MRI infusion protocol . Objectives : 1 . Compare area curve ( AUC ) map calculate glucose GBCA tumour contralateral brain area different time interval . 2 . Compare post-injection contrast enhance MRIs display maximum tumour contrast single image compare 'instantaneous ' contrast glucose enhance GBCA enhance MRI . Research Design Statistical Analysis : Participant recruitment : Recruitment begin collaborate radiation oncologist ask suitable patient interested participate MRI research study . The study describe patient still interested , consent take screening form complete . Participants schedule routine blood work screen eligibility ( blood glucose status renal function ) . Participants also schedule MRI appointment UBC MRI research centre . Participants ask fast night MRI scan . They suggest : '' Eat normal dinner eat drink water midnight MRI scan , schedule morning minimize fasting duration . '' MRI study detail : To perform UBC MRI research centre use 3T Philips Achieva MRI . Intravenous catheter preparation : Patients arrive intravenous catheter place one arm qualify nurse physician . Fasting glucose level measure glucometer use 1-2 mL sample blood . Only participants normal fast blood glucose level ( 70-125 mg/dL ) proceed study . The first intravenous catheter use monitor blood glucose every 10 minute bolus injection return normal . A second intravenous catheter place opposite arm glucose infusion GBCA ( gadobutrol ) infusion . Glucose infusion protocol : This occur participant lie MRI . The protocol mimic intravenous glucose tolerance test . Bolus injection hospital grade 25g 50 % dextrose solution 1 minute use increase blood glucose concentration approximately 3-4 time normal level . Blood glucose level return normal level within 30 60 minute accord previous study . GBCA infusion protocol : This also occur participant lie MRI approximately 20 minute glucose infusion . Standard intravenous bolus injection 0.1mM/kg gadobutrol ( Gadovist ) injection rate 5 mL/sec . MRI timeline : Metastatic tumour initially detect use standard 3D T2-weighted MRI . Then slice interest contain maximum tumour coverage select remainder study . In participant multiple metastasis , large untreated lesion focus multiple lesion include feasible . MRI scan include : 1 ) Scouts magnetic field shimming ; 2 ) 3D T2 weight MRI ; 3 ) Magnetic field map ( B0 &amp; B1 ) ; 4 ) Pre- glucose injection Z-spectrum ; 5 ) Begin serial glucose enhance MRI ; [ glucose infusion 3 minute ] ; 6 ) Post- glucose injection Z-spectrum 10 minute ; 7 ) Begin serial T1-weighted gadobutrol enhance MRI ; [ gadobutrol infusion 3 minute ] ; 8 ) Continue Gd-enhanced MRI scan 10 minute post-injection . MRI data analysis perform use well document , standard technique use custom-built Matlab software . Statistics : Mean standard deviation statistic calculate glucose enhance gadobutrol enhance data . Tumour contrast noise calculate use AUC curve well single MR image . These metric help quantify tumour detection sensitivity glucose enhance MRI relative GBCA enhance MRI . The investigator expect technique offer similar contrast noise metastatic tumour , base previously report result human participant glioma tumour .</detailed_description>
