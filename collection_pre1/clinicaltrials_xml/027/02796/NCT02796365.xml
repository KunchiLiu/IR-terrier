	<brief_title>Prevention Using Exercise Rehabilitation Offset Cardiac Toxicities Induced Via Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With 14 million cancer survivor United States , patient ever live well beyond initial cancer diagnosis . However despite tremendous progress , cancer treatment often come adverse side-effects , perhaps none serious devastate chemotherapy induce heart failure . In many patient , clinical manifestation heart failure may appear year , several year , completion chemotherapy . While echocardiogram part standardize surveillance patient drug , current echocardiogram parameter may sensitive enough quickly detect early heart damage , case , irreversible . Unfortunately , even detect early , uniformity term best treat patient subclinical cardiac dysfunction risk heart failure . The use certain blood pressure drug show promise , especially patient hypertension . However , addition drug side-effects ( e.g . dizziness/lightheadedness ) , target underlying mechanism chemotherapy induced cardiotoxicity . Exercise , various form , show promise animal study potential cardio-protective therapy counteract drug toxicity . In general , exercise many pleiotropic effect patient receive chemotherapy ( e.g . reduces fatigue , improve endurance , reduce frailty , enhance quality life ) . Relative DOX toxicity , research involve animal also show exercise protect deleterious heart dysfunction show enhancement potential mechanism involve chemotherapy induce heart failure ( i.e . anti-oxidant anti-apoptosis pathway ) . Patients cancer receive either doxorubicin ( DOX ) trastuzumab screen one two method : 1 ) strain echo 2 ) high sensitivity troponin . If either test positive , patient meet board-certified cardiologist determine patient may participate exercise trial . Under supervision train clinical exercise physiologist patient undergo baseline testing , include : quality life assessment via questionaires , body composition test , cardiopulmonary stress test muscle strength test . These assessment perform baseline 12 week . Also perform 12 week repeat strain echo high sensitivity troponin . Following baseline test patient randomize exercise train versus standard care . The exercise training include 12 week cardiac rehabilitation offer Detroit , Livonia , West Bloomfield . Exercise consist 3 day per week interval training aerobic exercise treadmill and/or bike 30-60 minute 1-2 day per week individualize resistance train program .</detailed_description>
