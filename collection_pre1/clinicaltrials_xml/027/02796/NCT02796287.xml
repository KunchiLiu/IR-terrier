	<brief_summary>The transient global amnesia ( IA ) define clinically temporary suspension isolate ante retrograde memory , totally regress within 24 hour . The cause AI remain unknown . The diagnosis IA base consensus clinical criterion include absence associate location mark . In clinical practice , MRI often perform conjunction clinical examination ensure absence differential diagnosis , include stroke . The visualization MRI signal abnormality relate AI directly dependent completion time review relation onset symptom . Typically , signal abnormality visible hyperacute phase ( ie D0-D1 ) punctate appear hyperintense diffusion sequence hippocampal structure J2 J7 disappear completely . It previously demonstrate use high value b / well spatial resolution significantly increase sensitivity broadcast sequence detection abnormality hippocampal signal . At St. Joseph Hospital , Investigators explore AI suspect patient diffusion tensor sequence ( DTI ) high resolution 3T MRI . Compared classical diffusion sequence , DTI characterize use great number direction diffusion gradient apply . One advantage technique able perform tractography white matter fiber . Thus `` connectome '' new technique post-processing DTI image base tractography ass network nerve fiber brain . By technique , value average diffusivity ( MD ) fractional anisotropy ( FA ) measure along study nerve fiber . Group study thus become feasible compare quantitatively healthy subject patient group term structural difference within connectome . The contribution technique recently highlight patient temporal lobe epilepsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Longitudinal Monitoring Cerebral Connectivity 3T MRI Patients With Transcient Global Amnesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . / OBJECTIVES The main objective study , use DTI realize 3T : 1.1 Main Objective - Highlight change brain connectivity induce occurrence transient global amnesia acute monitor remote anomaly ( 1 year initial episode IA ) . 1.2 Secondary Objectives - Correlate brain connectivity abnormality identify data neuropsychological examination - Correlate brain connectivity abnormality identify Brain morphological data ( volume gray matter , white matter , hippocampal structure LCS ) potential hippocampal hyperintensities visible acute phase diffusion image ( number laterality ) 1.3 Methodology DESIGN : biomedical , prospective single-center topic AI episode part medical care within hospital group Paris Saint-Joseph , 185 Rue Raymond Losserand 75014 Paris . Study duration : 2 year May 2015 rate inclusion estimate average 2-3 patient per month ( ie inclusion period one year : May 2015 May 2016 last follow-up May 2017 ) . start end date : May 2015 May 2017 Number topic include : This exploratory study , single center , rare disease , incidence stroke estimate amnesia 3 8 patient per 100 000 per year accord recent study . - Based feasibility study previously carry within department , Investigators estimate approximately 30 % refusal participate study . - Only 3T MRI allow proper sequence : available every day practice brain MRI In context , Investigators therefore believe 45 number subject may recruit period inclusion ( 2 year ) 2 . / COURSE OF STUDY 2.1 Patients MRI Only patient refer achieve brain MRI part typical transient global amnesia Radiology Department Paris Saint Joseph Hospital Group include succession . For subject , follow clinical data collect : - Age , sex - Medical background - Duration AI , date circumstance occurrence - Current Treatments In acute phase , change usual care patient . The patient consultation neurologist D0 / D1 ensure typical character clinical presentation . An MRI perform day 2 onset symptom confirm diagnosis . The usual course MRI modify way , include reception patient , information MRI scan search against-indications . The image acquire use 3T MRI ( GE Discovery MR 750 ) 32 element antenna head . The conventional imaging protocol include DTI sequence , FLAIR 3DT1 without gadolinium ( 15 minute acquisition ) . As part study , direct modification image protocol . Changes management patient related application protocol : - To carry neuropsychological examination acute phase - Renew one year episode AI neurological consultation neuropsychological evaluation brain MRI protocol acquisition time 15 minute without gadolinium . Study design Annex 2 . 2.1 Post process The post processing data conduct research platform Lille University Hospital , specialize advanced image technique ( Prof. Xavier Leclerc , Mr Renaud Lopes ) , include follow step : - From 3D T1 sequence : parcellation cortex region interest necessary evaluation connectome , volume measurement SG , SB , LCS seahorses use software `` Freesurfer `` - From DTI sequence : obtaining connectivity map subject measurement MD FA - Statistical comparison different group subject ( patient vs control J2 ( healthy subject ) patient 1 year v control , patient Day 2 v 1 year ) obtain connectivity graph show significant difference group term FA MD . The control ( healthy subject ) obtain database `` 1000 connectomes '' available online . 3 . / IMAGE ANALYSIS Image analysis do two stage . 1 . / interpretation `` clinical '' image , immediately aim answer follow question : - There stroke ? another injury ? whether patient exclude study - Vascular leukopathy accord scale Fazekas ? stigma ischemic hemorrhagic lesion ? - Typical hippocampal hyperintensities AI ? laterality number injury collect subject . 2 . / post processing image ( see ) . 4 / STATISTICAL ANALYSIS - Descriptive analysis result - Comparison connectivity graph represent value FA MD among three group subject : normal subject , patient explore D2 , explore patient 1 year - SG volume comparison , SB , LCS seahorses among three group subject : normal subject , patient explore D2 , explore patient 1 year - Search correlation connectivity anomalies 1 / lateral abnormal hippocampal signal , - 2 / volume measure sequence 3DT1 - 3 / abnormal neuropsychological examination 5 / ETHICS / REGULATORY : This protocol present add risk patient . The initial MRI examination D2 routinely perform part routine monitoring patient IA . Changes management patient related application protocol renew 1-year episode AI : - Neurological consultation neuropsychological evaluation - Brain MRI protocol acute MRI perform acquisition time 15 minute without gadolinium . Data processing carry within research platform Lille University Hospital anonymized way . Collaboration already underway research center several joint publication field inflammatory vascular disease . The principal investigator ( Dr. Hodel ) exercise structure . To start search CRC GHPSJ , promoter must submit permit application competent authority ( ANSM biomedical research health product ) . In accordance Article L.1123-6 Public Health Code , research protocol must submit proponent Patient Protection Committee choice ( CPP Ile de France II ) . The opinion committee notify competent authority developer start research . When protocol quality control data CRA representative promoter enters scope CNIL simplify procedure , developer ask head computer file ( investigator-coordinator research ) commit compliance methodology reference MR001 simplify . The inclusion patient occur patient 's information collection write consent ; information consent trace file . The patient 's consent seek : 1 . / use data acquire acute phase research purpose 2 . / make new MRI consultation Neurology 1 year onset symptom</detailed_description>
