	<detailed_description>This 2-year open-label extension double-blind , placebo-controlled GTi1201 study . The purpose study obtain additional 2 year safety data intravenously administer Alpha-1 MP 60 mg/kg/week subject AATD . The study consist Screening Visit ( visit End-of-Study Visit GTi1201 study subject complete GTi1201 study visit Early Discontinuation Visit subject meet early withdrawal criterion FEV1 decline ) , treatment period 104 week ( begin immediately screen [ day Screening Visit ] sooner 1 week last infusion investigational product GTi1201 study ) , End-of-Study Visit . Subjects meet entrance criterion extension study begin receive weekly intravenous ( IV ) infusion Alpha-1 MP 60 mg/kg day screen continue receive weekly infusion total 104 infusion . Safety assessment include adverse event , concomitant medication , complete physical examination ( exclude breast genitourinary examination ) , hematology , chemistry , urine cotinine , pregnancy test . Efficacy assessment include whole lung compute tomography density , quality-of-life assessment , carbon monoxide diffuse capacity , pulmonary function test . The occurrence chronic obstructive pulmonary exacerbation , also evaluate safety efficacy measurement .</detailed_description>
