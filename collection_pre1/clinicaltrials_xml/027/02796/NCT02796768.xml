	<brief_summary>Ultrasound image ( US ) , radiation-free imaging modality , currently use diagnosis developmental dysplasia hip ( DDH ) infant . The current protocol involve manually identify specific measure prone error , may give rise false positive . We aim use 2-dimensional ( 2D ) 3-dimensional ( 3D ) ultrasound image create automatic measurement procedure hope reduce error measurement increase reliability .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES To investigate use novel approach accurate automatic extraction bone , cartilage muscle surface 3D US image , automatically characterize infant DDH hip . To evaluate performance 3D US-based approach , compare result regular 2D US image patient radiology archive institution . HYPOTHESIS We hypothesize automatically extract bone/cartilage boundary provide useful information DDH , enable reliable reproducible diagnosis , reduce false diagnostic positive negative DDH . Using 3D US may reveal clinically significant disease dysplasia metric potential change diagnostic procedure . AIMS : 1 . To determine automatically extracted 3D bone/cartilage surface provide useful information ( i.e. , disease dysplasia metric ) assessment DDH provide good visualization infant hip anatomy comparison regular 2D US-based DDH assessment . 2 . To determine diagnose DDH use 3D US image reduces operator dependent false positive false negative rate . 3 . To determine 3D US-based dysplasia metric valuable track disease progression 2D US-based dysplasia metric . RESEARCH METHOD Parents infant refer Orthopaedic Clinic institution suspect diagnosed DDH approach Orthopaedic Department 's research staff participate study . We hop reach n=75 expect 33 % lose follow . Once eligible infant identify clinical staff , research staff outline study obtain informed consent . The parent inform four additional scan session would like collect . Two separate orthopaedic surgeon perform one 3D one 2D scan session , assess inter-rater reliability . In order ass intra-rater reliability , scan session consist 2 successive scan . A major goal study show automate image extraction/analysis 3D US reproduce finding expert clinician train DDH diagnosis . The 3D image process use confidence-weighted local-phase feature base image processing method . Accordingly , dysplasia metric directly compare two specialist determine feasibility approach . Should method prove efficacious , study could potentially investigate whether aspect patient care could make responsibility nurse practitioner . A secondary goal study assess 3D US compare 2D US track DDH progression . In order investigate , give parent option opt second set US scan necessary infant return clinic follow-up treatment . This mandatory criterion inclusion study . However , current clinical practice involve check DDH progression 2D US scan , provide additional information could valuable compare two scan method track DDH progression . This option present parent form check box consent form opt wish . DATA ANALYSIS The reliability accuracy 3D image-derived dysplasia metric compare standard 2D B-mode US image term variability within inter-rater intra-rater measurement . For statistical significance improvement diagnostic procedure , require least 50 infant least one affected hip suspect affected hip DDH . We ask recruitment size 75 believe least 33 % lose follow . This achieve perform comparison study 2D 3D US image collect patient clinic visit . Orthopaedic surgeon institution ask identify important feature ( process un-processed ) US image . For 2D image , surgeon measure α ß angle percent coverage femur . Intra- inter-rater reliability calculate use kappa score . For 3D image , profile α ß angle 3-dimensional percentage coverage femur ( i.e . volume coverage instead surface coverage ) , measure . These manual measurement compare measurement determine automatic image extraction analysis test improvement diagnostic procedure .</detailed_description>
