	<brief_summary>Phantom limb pain ( PLP ) frequent consequence amputation , notoriously difficult treat . Amputation usually follow traumatic injury surgery follow vascular disease , diabetes , osteomyelitis tumour case loss limb require survival patient . The loss limb body part usually follow sensation lose body part still present felt . These phenomenon call , respectively , phantom awareness phantom sensation . In 50-80 % amputee neuropathic pain develop lose limb also refer phantom limb pain ( PLP ) . PLP relate certain position movement phantom limb , might elicit worsened range physical factor ( e.g . change weather pressure residual limb ) psychological factor ( e.g . emotional stress ) . It well known treatment available PLP today , pharmacological , surgical , anaesthetic , psychological , ineffective . Today believe phantom limb pain may relate change cortex brain . There evidence change may modulate - even reverse - provide sensory input stump amputation zone . For example , cortical reorganization alleviation phantom limb pain observe amputee follow intense use hand prosthesis . However , consistent knowledge type peripheral sensory feedback may effective affect cortical plasticity best apply sensory feedback . The aim propose research create natural , meaningful sensation provide invasive sensory feedback ( i.e . electrical stimulation intraneural implantation electrode ) effectiveness alleviate phantom limb pain restore cortical neuroplastic change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In current study , take place Lausanne University Hospital ( CHUV , Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois ) , 1-2 hand amputate patient experience severe PLP enrol implanted intraneural nerve electrode arm stump maximal 6 month . Nerve electrode implant two nerve arm stump . During daily stimulation session electrode connect external stimulator via transcutaneous lead . During session , selective nerve stimulation perform . The amputee patient experience sensation ( movement , touch , temperature , vibration etc . ) originate phantom limb . While implanted , investigator investigate well induce sensation provide stimulation therapy , consist stimulation activity therefore require patient focus evoke sensation . Prior , follow therapy series assessment ( standardize across EPIONE partner enable comparison ) conduct relate therapy PLP , cortical organization , mental state etc . patient . Timing clinical assessment conduct follow phase : 1 . First visit 2 . Pre-screening visit 3 . Baseline Entry 4 . Implantation 5 . Intervention period : intensive therapy , preliminary outcome , semi-intensive therapy , monitor 6 . Outcome 7 . Follow-up 8 . Explantation Procedures standardize across international EPIONE partner ( carry different intervention , similar assessment ) , enable comparison treatment modality . Phase 1 : First visit . The subject invite meeting principal investigator one senior researcher involve study inform experiment . Only PI , medical doctor , allow answer health medical related question . Phase 2 : Pre-screening . This phase conduct start experiment subject sign informed consent form . Via questionnaires , test interview evaluate subject fulfills inclusion criterion relation physical health ( able undergo surgery ) , depression , normal range IQ PLP . The principal investigator evaluate result decide whether subject include exclude . Phase 3 : Baseline Entry . This phase aim determine stability intra-subject variability pain sensation without treatment . The measure control daily variability pain , assessment score variability , site-to-site variability inter subject variability `` intervention '' state . These variance use analysis estimate baseline noise measure . In addition questionnaire use quantify perceived phantom limb pain sensation , last week implantation include application cortical mapping method ( EEG fMRI ) . During phase study subject require fill diary go bed development PLP day . Phase 4 : Implantation . After initial phase patient implant 4 TIME-4H ( Transverse Intrafascicular Multichannel Electrode Version 4 Human ) electrodes . Surgical implantation TIME-4H electrode conduct full anaesthesia . During operation , median ulnar nerve free incision 20 cm medial aspect upper-arm . The fascicles nerve dissect free couple centimetre level TIME-4H electrode implant . Four TIME-4H electrode pull fascicle nerve use attached needle thread , two TIME-4H nerve . The electrode anchor nerve use dedicate anchor point TIME-4H . After place electrodes electrical integrity TIME-4H electrode test , close wound . Wires lead skin wound close . During surgery subject treat prophylactic antibiotic . Prophylactic antibiotic administer later study due risk development resistance . After implantation subject offer stay hospital enable routine assessment surgical outcome long PI judge necessary . The subject routinely wound wire exit arm clean treat reduce risk infection . This conducted nurse member project group . The subject receive training treating/cleaning wound also symptoms aware . Phase 5 : Intervention . One week surgery , patient start daily session nerve stimulation . Therapy PLP sensation assess via questionnaire prior follow stimulation therapy . Several assessment conduct phase purpose characterize sensation evoke provide sensory stimulation therapy aim alleviate phantom limb pain . Programs stimulation perform every day ( weekend exclude ) 3 hour per day accord daily experimental aim compliance patient . The experience last 12 maximum 20 week divide four different phase : 1 . Intensive therapy ( 1st 4th week ) ; period experiment carry every day , Monday Friday ; 2 . Preliminary outcome ( 5th week ) ; week , experiment carry every day , Monday Friday ; It consist questionnaire cortical mapping ( EEG fMRI ) . 3 . Semi-intensive therapy ( 6th 11th week ) ; period experiment carry two day per week , Monday Tuesday ( two consecutive day week patient would prefer ) ; 4 . Monitoring ( 12th week end experiment , later 20th week ) ; period experiment carry week Monday ( day could change accord possibility patient work team ) ; period weekly evaluation perform , case success trial treat PLP , VAS score become 2 point great minimum score achieve previous period trial , type necessity connect implant use would occur . A cortical mapping ( EEG fMRI ) schedule carried preliminary outcome end therapy ( phase 6 ) . Stimulation perform aim induce meaningful sensory input subject thereby induce normalization cortical organization alleviation PLP . This seek accomplished performing activity ( program ) reintroduce miss limb subject 's body image . The program 1 ( Pr1 ) experiment perform order characterize channel TIME-4H electrode . The Pr1 perform : - intensive phase : • first three day first week implant ; • first day follow week ( order record possible change location , type strength generate sensation lower threshold upper limit charge , week ) ; - semi-intensive phase : • first day week ( order record possible change location , type strength generate sensation lower threshold upper limit charge , week ) ; - monitoring phase : • day week experiment carry ( order record possible change location , type strength generate sensation lower threshold upper limit charge , week ) . Only observed change stabilize map , active site change observed mapping re-executed . The program 2 ( Pr2 ) experiment aim measure impedance patient electrode system purpose characterizing , investigate possible change consecutive day eventually correlate change low threshold upper limit current period . The Pr2 perform : - intensive phase : • first day week - semi-intensive phase : • first day week - monitoring phase : • day week experiment carry The program 3 ( Pr3 ) aim explore different strategy simultaneous asynchronous synchronous multichannel electrical intraneural stimulation . This program perform aim try different combination channel identify best pattern treat phantom limb pain enrol patient . The Pr3 perform : - intensive phase : • last two day first week implant ; • second day follow week - semi-intensive phase : • first day week - monitoring phase : • day week experiment carry . During treatment program ( Tr ) , investigator test possibility drive stimulation produce electrical stimulator transform signal sensor ( ) robotic hand , voluntarily control user . More specifically , investigator ask patient perform several task ( depend capacity , availability motivation ) : 1 . Execution different force level ( 8 level ) hand prosthesis 2 . Identification object physical property 3 . Embodiment test 4 .
