	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate whether prescribed physical activity , part standard care , improve sleep functional outcome hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) ( stem cell transplantation ) patient typical 30-day hospitalization period . OUTLINE : Data include demographic , type HCT ( e.g. , allogeneic autologous ) , preexist physical condition ( e.g. , chronic joint injury ) , chronic renal failure ( CRF ) , steroid use data , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) score collect patient ' medical chart time enrollment . Patients prescribed participation primarily self-directed physical activity program encourages spend 6 hour bed daily perform 30 minute light-to-moderate daily aerobic activity . Patients able maintain independent mobility undergo physical therapist assessment 2 time week hospital discharge . Patients wear physical activity monitoring device daily activity sleep data collect continuously hospital length stay ( LOS ) .</detailed_description>
