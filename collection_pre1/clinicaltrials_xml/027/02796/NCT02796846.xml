	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate pre postoperative CPAP compliance rate OSA surgical patient without CPAP prescription . In study , diagnose OSA patient without CPAP prescription approach informed consent enroll study . Documented OSA define OSA diagnosis base previous laboratory portable PSG , prescription CPAP OSA . The patient CPAP prescription follow determine compliance CPAP data collect determine O2 saturation . Those patient diagnose obstructive sleep apnea without CPAP prescription also follow objectively determine severity OSA would indicate whether require CPAP owe mild OSA fact may require CPAP due change weight etc . Preoperative overnight oximetry perform OSA patient home surgery . In postoperative period , patient follow nocturnal oximetry first two post-operative night hospital stay . Postoperative compliance CPAP evaluate recorded patient . The patient ' chart review postoperative complication . The clinical management patient leave discretion perioperative care team .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Association CPAP Compliance Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common sleep-related breathing disorder . CPAP establish first line treatment OSA patient improvement quality life significant reduction incidence cardiovascular event . However , evidence efficacy CPAP perioperative period largely lack . A prospective cohort study conduct Brar et al . find despite use prescibed CPAP therapy , 18 % OSA patient become hypoxic night follow surgery advocate postoperative oximetry monitoring CPAP treat OSA surgical patient . The investigator would like determine effect CPAP compliance reduce postoperative hypoxia complication surgical patient OSA . The result study would provide valuable data rate non-compliance CPAP surgical patient history diagnose OSA CPAP prescription impact non-compliance CPAP postoperative outcome , especially oxygen saturation . In study , diagnose OSA surgical patient without CPAP prescription approach informed consent enroll study . All study participant monitor O2 desaturation use wrist-watch pulse oximeter home one night preoperatively first 2 night post-operatively hospital . The subject enrol bring CPAP unit ( certified hospital engineering department per hospital policy ) mask hospital . The OSA patient without CPAP prescription follow perioperatively determine severity OSA ascertain rationale CPAP prescription . Pre post-operative CPAP usage data collect interviewing patient , chart review monitor record smart CPAP device .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . All adult surgical patient ( &gt; 18 yr ) diagnosis OSA without CPAP prescription . 2 . Scheduled noncardiac surgery ( general surgery , orthopedics , urology , plastic surgery spine ) expect require postoperative hospital stay one night . 1 . They unwilling unable give inform consent study . 2 . They supplemental oxygen preoperatively ( daytime nocturnal ) . 3 . They pregnant . 4 . Surgery include tonsillectomy , septoplasty , uvuloplasty , pharyngoplasty , tracheostomy , prolonged ( &gt; 48 hr ) postoperative mechanical ventilation lung anticipate . These procedures/interventions likely cure least modify severity OSA .</criteria>
