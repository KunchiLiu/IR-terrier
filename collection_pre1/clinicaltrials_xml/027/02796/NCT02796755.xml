	<brief_summary>The goal propose research determine whether riluzole , drug increase glutamate reuptake , decrease CNS glutamate breast cancer survivor increase inflammation fatigue . We also determine whether decrease glutamate riluzole reverse inflammation-related fatigue symptom include cognitive dysfunction decrease motivation . To accomplish goal , plan conduct 8 week , double-blind , randomize control trial riluzole ( 100 mg/d ) versus placebo 40 breast cancer survivor ( n=20 per group ) . All breast cancer survivor complete treatment within 1-3 year fatigue level ≥4 ( 10 point scale ) plasma c-reactive protein ( CRP ) concentration &gt; 3mg/L ( indicative high inflammation ) . Patients undergo magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) measure CNS glutamate 2 8 week riluzole placebo treatment . Fatigue behavioral assessment include measure cognitive function motivation conduct treatment correlate change CNS glutamate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective propose research provide first data role CNS glutamate symptom fatigue breast cancer patient use MRS medication show low CNS glutamate animal model human subject . No previous study examine potential connection increase inflammation , increase CNS glutamate symptom breast cancer patient , although strong clinical preclinical support important interrelationship among variable . Identification significant relationship increase CNS glutamate symptom : - Enable development inflammatory biomarkers identify patient alter CNS glutamate . - Help focus future study use glutamate stabilizing medication glutamate antagonist patient likely respond glutamate-targeted therapy ( personalization trial treatment ) . - Expand treatment study include synergistic sequential target inflammation glutamate reduce symptom burden breast cancer patient . This study also serve foundation effort link impact inflammatory cytokine relationship increase CNS glutamate behavior variety cancer . Moreover , test novel treatment approach ( target glutamate ) , study may ultimately improve quality life breast cancer cancer patient .</detailed_description>
