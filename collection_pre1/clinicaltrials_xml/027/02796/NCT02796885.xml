	<brief_summary>Hypophosphatasia ( HPP ) inherit condition cause defect bone calcification , lead weak bone . Early childhood form severe easily recognise , drug treatment effective child . Adult form milder , often miss doctor confuse osteoporosis . This important usual osteoporosis treatment may harmful HPP , increase risk broken bone . One reason miss lack research describe typical feature HPP , doctor n't recognise sign , n't know test . The aim study establish clear criterion ( clinical history , examination blood test ) identify people HPP . The result also determine trial drug treatment adult HPP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypophosphatasia ( HPP ) genetic disorder cause mutation tissue-non-specific alkaline phosphatase gene ( TNSALP ) . It cause impaired bone mineralisation , fracture , tooth loss , muscle weakness possibly adverse health outcome . The infantile-onset form severe , often fatal recent availability treatment ( Asfotase Alfa , Alexion Pharma ) . The childhood-onset form less severe , adult-onset form mild , often unrecognised misdiagnosed osteoporosis . The less severe form disease well describe , available treatment much research adult . However , treatment available possibility clinical trial adult . Additionally , patient hypophosphatasia often recognise , misdiagnosed osteoporosis . This important patient hypophosphatasia risk develop atypical femoral fracture treat usual osteoporosis medication ( bisphosphonates ) . A major contributor under-recognition adult HPP lack phenotypic description biomarker definition . The aim project identify clinical biochemical characteristic identify HPP . In preparation study reference range commonly use HPP biomarkers ( ALP PLP ) establish , use screen 2000 patient present metabolic bone service Sheffield Oxford . For study , patient biochemistry suggestive HPP ( low ALP high PLP ) , undergo detailed clinical assessment , medical history , physical examination , bone biochemistry , target musculoskeletal imaging HPP gene test . Their result compare control group metabolic bone clinic patient normal ALP PLP , group patient know gene-proven clinically manifest HPP . The result establish clinical phenotype biomarker criterion HPP diagnosis , could incorporate future pathway patient present metabolic bone clinic . This improve identification HPP prevent harm incorrect treatment bisphosphonates .</detailed_description>
