	<brief_summary>The investigator use non-invasive recording brain activity measure pain proxy self-report . Participants undergo test 3 hour two separate day . The test involve experience painful heat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alpha Predictive Biomarker</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neurophysiological investigation pain suggest electroencephalograph ( EEG ) measure peak alpha frequency might provide mean pain assessment . In healthy subject , increase peak alpha frequency strongly correlate pain self-reports exposure acute noxious heat . Conversely , chronic pain patient compare healthy control display decrease peak alpha frequency higher alpha power . Measures peak alpha frequency also show negative relationship disease duration , suggest peak alpha frequency may index ongoing pain also disease progression . The overall aim determine predictive accuracy , reliability , specificity EEG alpha activity acute pain model neuropathic pain healthy subject .</detailed_description>
