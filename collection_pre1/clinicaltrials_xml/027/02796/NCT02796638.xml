	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE ( S ) : The main goal study evaluate utility Minute Ventilation Adaptive Servo-ventilation ( MV-ASV ) device mitigate deterioration renal function prevent kidney injury patient admit acute heart failure compare receive usual care . We assess effect MV-ASV diuretic dose , urine output new excite biomarkers renal function kidney injury . If hypothesis prof correct , strongly suggest ASV lessen hypoxia kidney could lead new paradigm treatment AHF . When use high dose diuretic anticipate CKD AKI present arrival Emergency Department , use MV-ASV might decrease amount diuretic need , allow continue use ACE inhibitor , ultimately mitigate rise creatinine decrease effective glomerular filtration . Since kidney injury major factor patient early 30-day readmission follow discharge , therapy could become quite popular . RESEARCH DESIGN : This interventional , principal investigator-initiated project patient enrollment , cohort development data analysis . We recruit 66 patient acute heart failure evidence volume overload elevate BNP , since anticipate 10 % dropout . Half pre-selected CKD eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 . Randomization attempt within first six hour hospital presentation . The participant randomize one follow two group : 1 ) receive standard therapy 2 ) receive standard therapy adaptive servo-ventilation ( ASV ) therapy . METHODOLOGY : Methods : 1 . Consenting patient : every attempt make consent within six hour evaluation , feel good window ASV . Maximum time consent 24 hour . 2 . Sleep breathe assessment : Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) , Epworth Sleepiness Scale , Pulmonary Sleep Lab Questionnaire , Sleep Diary , Likert Scale 3 . Blood Sample Collections : 4 . Two 10cc ( 20cc total ) blood sample standard collection tube obtain via venipuncture peripheral IV line enrol patient time enrollment . 5 . One sample collect lithium heparin tube sample collect EDTA tube . Initial blood sample collect initiation standard medical therapy stabilization acute heart failure . 6 . The blood sample analyze cardiac biomarkers BNP , high sensitivity troponins ( hsTnI ) , endothelin-1 ( ET-1 ) , kidney injury molecule-1 ( KIM-1 ) Singulex , adrenomedullin ( hADM ) Sphingotec . Remaining blood sample bank future biomarker analysis . All sample hold VASDHS clinical laboratory storage facility indefinitely future analysis biomarkers inflammation , fibrosis cardiorenal syndrome . NO GENETIC TESTING do sample . 7 . As obligated , report incidental finding FDA approve biomarkers perform , part analysis bank specimen , patient treat physician . 8 . All specimen freeze -80 degree Celsius storage . 9 . Specimens evidence hemolysis analyze . 10 . MV-ASV Treatment Respiration Monitoring : - Adaptive Servo-Ventilation ( ASV ) therapy place patient respiratory therapy team soon patient enrol study . The ASV device ASV Auto mode , automatic expiratory positive airway pressure ( EPAP ) adjustment base patient 's breathing . The ASV Auto default EPAP range 4-15cmH2O pressure support range 3-15cmH2O . The backup rate ASV adaptive base patient 's respiratory rate . However , automatic ventilation set suitable maintain target ventilation , set 15 breath per minute use . - We ask patient use ASV therapy hour sleep stay hospital time awake , feel comfortable use . - The patient closely monitor first hour make sure patient comfortable , right setting without mask leak . The monitoring team consist member Cardiology , Pulmonary Critical Care Respiratory Therapy . 11 . Repeat follow assessment hospital day five day - Two tube 10cc ( 20 cc total ) - Likert dyspnea assessment - Sleep diary entry day 5 day - Urine output - Daily weight - Dose diuretic 12 . Additional hospital data record : - Presence arrhythmia - Need inotropes - Need intubation - Number ICU day - Total number hospital day - Need renal consult - Electrolytes - BNP - Troponins 13 . Once subject discharge hospital , follow happen : - They see 30 day follow : - Evaluation event - Sleepiness scale : Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) , Epworth Sleepiness Scale , Pulmonary Sleep Lab Questionnaire , Sleep Diary , Likert Scale - Two tube blood ( 10cc ) drawn , describe assess renal function AKI - They reimburse visit 14 . Power analysis â€¢ The comparison group size 30 30 power 0.815 detect effect equal group difference ( 0.75 ) standard deviation . This would apply variable univariate test significance level 0.05 appropriate correction multiple comparison . CLINICAL RELATIONSHIPS : The potential benefit study include validation use ASV device treatment heart failure . ASV treatment might decrease amount diuretic need , allow continue use ACE inhibitor , ultimately mitigate rise creatinine decrease effective glomerular filtration . ASV treatment may lessen hypoxia kidney could lead new paradigm treatment AHF . IMPACT/SIGNIFICANCE : Heart failure major cause death healthcare spending United States . ASV cost effective , non-invasive treatment improve symptom cardiac outcome patient heart failure . Validation MV-ASV device effective treatment could help improve prognosis quality life patient often terminal condition .</detailed_description>
