	<brief_summary>This research test new ultra-rapid technology ( call ID/AST Accelerate system ) use digital microscope identify bacteria base growth pattern . This method wait bacteria grow lab . The new method identify type bacteria within 2 hour receive specimen . The new method also show effect select antibiotic bacteria include multidrug resistant bacteria doctor know within 6 hour specimen collection antibiotic kill bacteria . To check accuracy , speed impact new method antibiotic prescribing , investigator propose study two part ; The first part test accuracy speed result obtain new method . The second part test result new method early would change antibiotic prescribed patient simulation experiment . An independent infectious disease physician show result new method ask result accurate , would change antibiotic treatment patient .</brief_summary>
