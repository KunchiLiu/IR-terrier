	<brief_summary>This study patient advance stage III stage IV melanoma adequately treat surgery progress treatment nivolumab pembrolizumab . The purpose study see give high dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) progression nivolumab pembrolizumab effective treat metastatic melanoma . This study also do look severity side effect IL-2 patient . IL-2 approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment advanced melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study High Dose Bolus IL2 Patients With Inoperable Stage III Stage IV Melanoma Who Have Failed Prior Anti-PD1 Immunotherapy : Efficacy Biomarker Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II study high dose bolus interleukin-2 ( HD IL2 ) patient advance inoperable stage III stage IV melanoma prior anti-PD1 immunotherapy . Each course consist 2 cycle HD IL2 follow : high-dose IL2 600,000 IU/kg give intravenously ( IV ) every 8 hour 14 dos ( one cycle ) , follow rest period 1-2 week readmission second HD IL2 cycle 14 dos ( second cycle ) . The planned treatment consist 3 course ( 6 cycle ) HD IL-2 . Response assessment occur end course therapy patient without evidence disease progression ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors , RECIST , version 1.1 ) limit toxicity offer additional course treatment HD IL2 maximum 3 course .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm metastatic melanoma . This include American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) stage IV advanced/inoperable stage III . This also include patient history low stage melanoma subsequent recurrent metastatic disease either locally/regionally advanced/inoperable disease distant metastasis . Patients must measurable disease , accord RECIST version 1.1 Patients must free active brain metastasis contrastenhanced CT/MRI scan within 4 week prior enrollment . If know prior brain metastasis , must adequately manage standard care radiation therapy , stereotactic radiosurgery surgery prior registration study . A patient must previously receive antiPD1 immunotherapy ( nivolumab pembrolizumab ) later experienced disease progression , within 3 month registration study . Patients must receive systemic therapy radiotherapy within precede 3 week . Patients must recover adverse event previous therapy time registration . Patients must least 4 week major surgery fully recover effect surgery , free significant detectable infection prior registration . For patient receive prior antiCTLA4 monoclonal antibody therapy ( ipilimumab tremelimumab ) , risk bowel perforation IL2 therapy . Therefore , patient history colitis diarrhea antiCTLA4 monoclonal antibody therapy , recommend formal evaluation gastroenterologist colonoscopy/endoscopy consider demonstrate absence active bowel inflammation initiate IL2 therapy protocol . Life expectancy great 3 month opinion investigator . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 ( Karnofsky &gt; /=70 % ) Patients must normal organ marrow function define clinical trial protocol . Patients fulldose anticoagulant ( e.g. , warfarin ) prothrombin time ( PT ) / international normalize ratio ( INR ) &gt; 1.5 eligible provide follow criterion meet : ( ) The patient inrange INR ( usually 2 3 ) stable dose oral anticoagulant stable dose low molecular weight heparin . ( b ) The patient active bleed pathological condition carry high risk bleeding ( e.g. , tumor involve major vessel know varix ) . Pulmonary : forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) &gt; 2.0 liter &gt; 75 % predict height age . Pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) require patient 50 year old significant pulmonary smoking history . Cardiac : No evidence congestive heart failure , symptom coronary artery disease , myocardial infarction le 6 month prior entry , serious cardiac arrhythmia , unstable angina . Patients 40 year old previous myocardial infarction great 6 month prior study entry significant cardiac family history ( CAD serious arrhythmia ) require negative low probability cardiac stress test ( example , thallium stress test , stress multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) , stress echo exercise stress test ) cardiac ischemia within 8 week prior registration . Central Nervous System ( CNS ) : No history cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack within past 6 month registration . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , least 6 month completion study therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Women lactate , childbearing age , negative pregnancy test ( bHCG test ; serum urine , minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit bHCG ) within two week registration study . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients systemic therapy melanoma radiotherapy within 3 week prior register study recover adverse event due agent administer 3 week earlier . Patients history endocrinopathies ( e.g . hypothyroidism , adrenal insufficiency , hypopituitarism ) eligible stable hormone replacement therapy . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients active brain metastasis exclude clinical trial except note . Patients clinically significant cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease : 1. history cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack within past 6 month registration . 2. myocardial infarction , coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) unstable angina within past 6 Months registration . 3 . New York Heart Association grade III great congestive heart failure , serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication , unstable angina pectoris within past 6 month registration . 4. clinically significant peripheral vascular disease within past 6 month registration . PT INR &gt; 1.5 unless patient fulldose warfarin . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients current malignancy eligible . Patients malignancy eligible continuously disease free &gt; 2 year prior time registration . Patients prior history time situ cancer , lobular carcinoma breast situ , cervical cancer situ , atypical melanocytic hyperplasia melanoma situ eligible . Patients prior history basal squamous skin cancer eligible . Patients multiple primary melanoma eligible . Patients must autoimmune disorder condition immunosuppression require current ongoing treatment systemic corticosteroid ( systemic immunosuppressant ) , include oral steroid ( i.e. , prednisone , dexamethasone ) continuous use topical steroid cream ointment ophthalmologic steroid steroid inhaler . If patient take steroid , least 2 week must pass since last dose . Patients stable physiologic replacement dos steroids form hormone replacement therapy eligible .</criteria>
