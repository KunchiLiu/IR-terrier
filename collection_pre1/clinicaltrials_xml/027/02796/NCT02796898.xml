	<criteria>1 . Male ≥18 year age . 2 . Histologically cytologically confirm prostate cancer ( patient neuroendocrine carcinoma prostate exclude ) . 3 . Documented PSA progression . Preenrollment PSA progression define PCWG3 criterion , e.g . 3 value , increase , &gt; 7 day apart . 4 . ECOG performance status ≤1 5 . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month , judgment investigator . 6 . Adequate organ function define follow : 1 . Hematologic : Platelets ≥100 x 109 g/dL ; Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥1.5 x 109/L ( without platelet transfusion growth factor within 7 day prior screen laboratory assessment ) 2 . Hepatic : aspartate transaminase ( AST ) /alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; total conjugate bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN 3 . Renal : serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥60 mL/min calculate CockroftGault method 7 . Coagulation : International normalized ratio ( INR ) ≤1.2 8 . With without one prior line chemotherapy 9 . With without prior current ADT hormone base therapy ( 2 line total ) 10 . Can tolerate standard chemotherapy , hormone base therapy ADT , elect opt standard therapy . 11 . Patients ADT prior study need discontinue therapy study , use ADT study must document . 12 . All acute toxic effect prior antitumor therapy resolve Grade ≤1 baseline , exception alopecia ( Grade 1 2 permit ) neurotoxicity ( Grade 1 2 permit ) 13 . Male patient fertile potential engage heterosexual intercourse female partner childbearing potential must agree use highly effective contraception enrol study least 6 month follow last dose study drug . Highly effective birth control method include follow ( patient choose 2 used partner ) : 1 . Oral , injectable , implanted hormonal contraceptive 2 . Condom spermicidal foam , gel , film , cream , suppository 3 . Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam , gel , film , cream , suppository 4 . Intrauterine device 5 . Intrauterine system ( example , progestinreleasing coil ) 6 . Vasectomized male ( determined investigator ) 14 . Able willing provide write informed consent participate study 1 . PSA minimum start value &lt; 1 ng/mL trial entry . 2 . Metastatic disease detect bone scan , Computed Tomography ( CT ) , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , CTpositron emission tomography ( PET ) beyond prostate postsurgical prostate area . 3 . Any screening laboratory , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , finding , opinion investigator sponsor , indicate unacceptable risk patient 's participation study . 4 . History evidence clinically significant disorder , condition , disease , opinion investigator medical monitor would pose risk patient 's safety interfere study evaluation , procedure , completion . Examples include intercurrent illness active uncontrolled infection , active chronic bleeding event within 28 day baseline , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 5 . History concurrent second malignancy , except adequately treated local basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin , superficial bladder cancer , adequately treat Stage 1 2 cancer currently complete remission ; cancer complete remission ≥5 year 6 . Local therapy radiation surgery within 8 week study baseline . 7 . Current use prohibit medication ( see Section 8.5 ) require medication treatment phase 8 . Major surgery , define surgical procedure involve general anesthesia significant incision ( i.e. , large require placement central venous access , percutaneous feed tube , biopsy ) within 28 day first dose study drug 9 . Minor surgical procedure within 7 day baseline , yet recover prior surgery 10 . Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption component SM88 , e.g . cirrhosis 11 . Known human immunodeficiency ( HIV ) virus infection 12 . Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) positive 13 . Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) antibody positive 14 . Have previously enrol study study investigate SM88 15 . History drug allergy significant adverse reaction component SM88 . 16 . Are currently enrol , discontinue within 30 day screen , clinical trial involve investigational product nonapproved use drug device .</criteria>
