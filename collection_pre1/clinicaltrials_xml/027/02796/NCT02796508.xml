	<brief_summary>Neuroplasticity-based approach seem promise maintain cognitive health older adult postpone onset cognitive-decline dementia symptom . The aim project threefold : 1. evaluation effect neuroplasticity-based-cognitive randomized computer-based intervention consist train non-action video game brain cognitive function decline age , include attention spatial work memory ( WM ) , old adult use behavioral measure electrophysiological recording ( event-related potential -ERPs- event-related spectral perturbation -ERSPs ) ; 2. study effect age 3 month maintenance cognitive neural signature transfer effect attentional spatial WM task ; 3. investigate neuroinflammatory mechanism assess non-invasive method saliva participant underlie cognitive training-induced effect . A good understanding mechanism elucidate pathway may target future , either behavioral neuropsychological intervention . To achieve aim , investigator recruit 60-80 older adult volunteer participate randomize , control , single-blind study . After screen , participant randomly distribute one two group : experimental active control . Participants experimental group receive 16 1 hour computerized training non-action video game . The active control group receive 16 1 hour training session social video game . The design mixed factorial design type intervention ( experimental , active control ) assessment session ( pre , post , maintenance ) . The result propose research project clarify existence transfer-of-benefit neural mechanism underlie cognitive improvement . The hypothesis mental stimulation non-action video game improve attention memory , promote brain mental health , extend independence among elderly people avoid negative personal economic consequence long-term care .</brief_summary>
