	<brief_summary>Total Parenteral Nutrition ( TPN ) way feed person intravenously , require gastrointestinal tract able function properly . TPN contain carbohydrate , protein , fat lipid . It also contain mineral vitamin . The lipid currently use University Health Network home TPN program Intralipid20 % , base Soybean oil , contains polyunsaturated fat good source energy essential fatty acid , include omega 3 6 fatty acid , need body . However , long term use Intralipid20 % show negative effect antioxidant status , inflammation , liver , immune system . SMOFlipid20 % lipid emulsion design maximize ratio omega 3 omega 6 fatty acid , effort avoid potentially harmful effect associate Intralipid20 % . In previous study , show SMOFlipid20 % safe positive benefit liver enzymes . There study far follow patient SMOFlipid20 % long term . The investigator hope show long term use SMOFlipid20 % well liver function compare Intralipid20 % .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Intravenous Lipid Emulsions Home Parenteral Nutrition Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective double-blind , crossover , randomize clinical trial 13 month duration per participant compare 2 commercially available lipid emulsion , Intralipid v SMOF , patient receiving home parenteral nutrition ( HPN ) . All subject stable HPN patient receive Intralipid lipid emulsion solution . The subject randomize two group . One group receive Intralipid 6 month , follow 28 day wash-out period , receive SMOF 6 month . Another group receive SMOF first 6 month , follow 28 day wash-out period , receive Intralipid 6 month . During wash-out period group , patient receive Intralipid standard lipid emulsion . Each patient 4 clinic visit Toronto General Hospital clinical interview , nutritional measurement , routine blood test , special blood test baseline 6 , 7 , 13 month . Also , patient ask routine blood test month 3 month 9 . The patient fill food record collect late completion period , month 6 13 study . The investigator call patient period check compliance update condition include adverse event .</detailed_description>
