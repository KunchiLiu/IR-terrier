	<brief_summary>Purpose : The purpose study test new pharmacologic strategy weight loss patient schizophrenia , population current weight-loss treatment gain widespread use . The goal recruit overweight people schizophrenia participate 52-week double-blind , randomize study ass efficacy safety lorcaserin/metformin combination treatment , lorcaserin monotherapy , placebo weight , body composition , measure glucose lipid metabolism . Participants : Approximately 110 subject enrol two clinical site ( UNC Chapel Hill Columbia University ) Procedures ( method ) : Behavioral : All participant offer behavioral intervention weekly diet exercise counseling aim modify cardiovascular risk factor . This intervention provide in-person study visit Baseline Visit supplement weekly interim phone call reinforce lesson visit .

	<detailed_description>Overview Procedures : All procedure conduct either UNC Hospitals outpatient clinic Chapel Hill , NC , outpatient North Carolina Psychiatric Research Center ( NCPRC ) , specialized program University North Carolina Center Excellence Community Mental Health Raleigh , NC Lieber Schizophrenia Research Clinic New York State Psychiatric Institute ( NYSPI ) New York , NY . Screening : During initial clinic visit give informed consent , prospective subject ' psychiatric medical history review , physical exam conduct , demographic vital sign take , blood urine collect . Fasting lab order measure metabolic parameter ( lipid profile , glucose , hemoglobin A1C , insulin lipid ) well complete blood count ( CBC ) , electrolytes , liver/renal function test , TSH , urinalysis ( UA ) , serum pregnancy test , urine drug screen ( UDS ) . The Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV administer confirm diagnose Clinical Global Impressions-Severity ( CGI-S ) use evaluate global psychopathology . The baseline visit schedule within 28 day screen visit . A battery assessment administer include Clinical Global Impressions-Severity ( CGI-S ) , Alcohol Use Scale ( AUS ) , Drug Use Scale ( DUS ) , Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) , Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) , three assessment measure eat behavior ( EDE-Q , TFEQ , FCI ) . In addition paper pencil assessment , 24 hour food recall assessment administer telephone questionnaire train personnel UNC Nutrition Obesity Research Center . Accelerometry also use estimate subject ' sedentary active behavior . Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DXA ) also conduct baseline visit ( UNC location ) . Lastly , first behavioral intervention lesson occur baseline visit , provide direct lesson instruction diary subject ' take home recording homework progress . At completion baseline visit , subject continue meet study inclusion criterion randomize one three treatment group ( lorcaserin &amp; metformin , lorcaserin , placebo ) . Lorcaserin administer dosage 10mg maximum dose 20mg . Metformin administer dosage 500mg maximum dose 2,000mg . In addition , match placebo administer drug . Doses adjust base subject tolerability . All participant offer behavioral intervention weekly diet exercise counseling aim modify cardiovascular risk factor include weight , activity level , blood glucose , blood pressure lipid . This intervention provide trained clinician individualize session study visit Baseline Visit supplement weekly interim phone call reinforce lesson visit . The intervention adapt weight-reduction program develop patient severe mental illness ( Brar et al. , 2005 ) use METS ( Jarskog et al. , 2013 ) CAMP ( Stroup et al. , 2012 ) trial therefore well know research group readily implement part current proposal . After study enrollment , subject schedule Week 1 Week 2 study visit . The purpose visit assess medication management ( i.e. , symptom , adverse events/side effect , adherence , adjust dose indicate ) , collect vital sign , provide behavioral therapy intervention . The CGI-S complete Week 1 Week 2 , however , BRPS C-SSRS complete Week 2 . The next 5 study visit schedule bi-weekly in-person visit . These visit similar Week 1 Week , 2 addition Substance Use Scale Alcohol Use Questionnaire . After first two behavioral intervention session , interim telephone call make in-person study visit participant reinforce element program answer question . After Week 12 study visit , in-person study visit transition monthly visit rest year . The interim telephone call make bi-weekly in-person study visit participant continue reinforce element program answer question . At Week 52 , study measure fast lab collect . Vital sign , adverse event , side effect obtain in-person study visit . Monitoring labs appetite regulating hormone do Week 12 , Week 24 , Week 36 , Week 52 .</detailed_description>
