	<brief_summary>Background . Statins cholesterol lower drug prescribe low risk cardio-vascular disease . The use statin increase markedly one prescribed drug world . More 600,000 people Denmark take statin daily basis , approximately 40 % take medication without risk factor cardio-vascular disease elevate blood-cholesterol i.e . primary prevention . Statins without side effect study show elevated risk develop diabetes take statin . This lead increased debate use statins primary prevention . Furthermore large meta-analysis show prevent one event cardio-vascular disease , necessary treat 200 people 3-5 year . These data suggest conservative use statins prevent CVD otherwise healthy individual low risk future CVD may warrant . Other side effect statins muscle myalgia , muscle cramp fatigue potentially prevent physically active lifestyle . The biomedical background side effect fully elucidate show link decreasing level important enzyme , Q10 , play role muscle energy metabolism . Hypothesis The overarch research question : statin treatment cause muscle pain ? Does statin treatment impair ( even prohibit ) physical exercise training ? Furthermore follow question investigate : A . Does statin treatment cause : 1 . Decreased muscle strength ? 2 . Skeletal muscle inflammation ? 3 . Decreased mitochondrial respiratory function ? B. Abnormal glucose homeostasis ? Re question A &amp; B : If , physical training counteract effect statin treatment ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Hypercholesterolemia statin use Denmark Simvastatin commonly prescribe statin , class drug inhibit hydroxyl-methyl-glutaryl ( HMG ) coenzyme A reductase , thereby block biosynthesis cholesterol liver . Simvastatin prescribed individual elevate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) and/or total cholesterol , clinical parameter view risk factor cardiovascular-disease ( CVD ) , even absence health problem risk factor , previous myocardial infarction , diabetes hypertension . Approximately 40 % prescription statins issued primary prevention elevate cholesterol general practitioner patient without bodily symptom sign . Only `` cholesterol number '' make risk heart attack stroke visible . The lack symptom likely importance patient ' adherence treatment adverse effect . A number factor , information mass medium change daily life , may affect decision take treatment Treatment guideline hypercholesterolemia : The guideline indicate preventive treatment statin appropriate individual &gt; 10 % predict risk major vascular event within 5 year , , , opinion-leaders advocate 5 % threshold . Nevertheless , statin therapy fail reduce all-cause mortality meta-study 65,229 patient without CVD , diabetes . Similarly , Cochrane review analysis , include study 10 % patient history CVD , show 0.5 % reduction all-cause mortality , indicate every 200 patient take statin daily 5 year , 1 death would prevent . These data suggest conservative use statins prevent CVD otherwise healthy individual low risk future CVD may warrant . The downside : Rhabdomyolysis ( skeletal muscle cell death ) infrequent serious side-effect statin use , rare occasion lead acute renal failure death ( i.e. , 1.5 death per 106 prescription ) . Statin use much frequently associate muscle dysfunction , include myalgia ( muscle pain ) , cramp , weakness . The reported incidence myalgia vary 1 % ( pharmaceutical company report ) high 75 % statin-treated athlete . Mild severe myalgia strong disincentive regular exercise , regular exercise one critical life-style approach prevent CVD reduce blood cholesterol , significant down-side statin use . Regular exercise also effective prevent treat obesity type 2 diabetes , risk factor CVD . The mechanism behind myalgia know . However , investigator behind study recently demonstrate muscle mitochondrial function impair statin treatment Q10 protein may play key role . In addition , statin also negatively affect glucose tolerance , increase risk type 2 diabetes . Research question : The overarch research question : statin treatment cause muscle pain ? Does statin treatment impair ( even prohibit ) physical exercise training ? Furthermore follow question investigate : A . Does statin treatment cause : 1 . Decreased muscle strength ? 2 . Skeletal muscle inflammation ? 3 . Decreased mitochondrial respiratory function ? B. Abnormal glucose homeostasis ? Re question A &amp; B : If , physical training counteract effect statin treatment ? Methodology : Cohort Patients fulfil define inclusion exclusion criterion recruit General Practice clinic Copenhagen news paper advertisement . The vast majority patient assessed basis HeartScore risk estimation system offer direct estimation ten-year risk fatal cardiovascular disease format suit constraint clinical practice . A staggered recruitment implement . 30 men ( age : 40-70 year ; BMI : 25-35 kg/m2 ) initiation statin treatment primary prevention recruit . No risk factor CVD except elevate total cholesterol ( &gt; 6 mmol/l ) and/or elevate LDL cholesterol ( &gt; 3,5 mmol/l ) mild hypertension ( &lt; 160/100 mm Hg ) must present . The patient allocate ( randomization draw lot ) one three group : - Physical exercise training Simvastatin 40 mg/day Q10 placebo - Physical exercise training Simvastatin 40 mg/day Q10 400 mg/day supplementation - Physical exercise training , Simvastatin placebo Q10 placebo The intervention period 8 week series experimental day . Experimental day ( identical intervention ) : Information day : health examination , ECG Maximal oxygen uptake take ( VO2 max ) . Day 1 ( overnight fasting , approximately 5 hour ) : - Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan ( body composition body fat ) . - Oral glucose tolerance test + score questionnaire muscle pain/discomfort ( incl . Visual Analog Scale ) - Isokinetic strength Rate Force Development ( PowerRig KinCom dynamometer ) . - Repeated VO2-max-test Day 2 ( overnight fast approximately 7 hour ) : - Muscle biopsy , vastus lateralis - 2 step Euglycemic , hyperinsulinaemic clamp . Training programme All training supervise take place department . The training aerobic , bicycle ergometer training ( 45 min/session 60-70 % VO2max ) three time week 8 week .</detailed_description>
