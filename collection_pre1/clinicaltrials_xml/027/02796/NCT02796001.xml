	<detailed_description>The primary objective study ass relationship rhinovirus specific T-cell immunity human host response primary rhinovirus challenge subsequent secondary challenge either homologous heterologous rhinovirus serotypes . The overall hypothesis address mechanistic study proposal T helper Tfh cell direct conserved RV epitope expand upon RV exposure cell persist stable cross-reactive memory population capable display lineage-specific protective function upon re-infection relate unrelated strain RV . The human specimen collect study analyze variety state-of-the-art technique provide depth description T-cell responses rhinovirus infection , correlation response viral infection , antibody response , illness . Beyond objective , use system biology approach , aim gain new insight role diverse cell type involve adaptive immunity rhinovirus .</detailed_description>
