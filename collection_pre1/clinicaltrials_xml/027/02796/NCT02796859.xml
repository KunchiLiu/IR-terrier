	<brief_summary>This study Phase 1 clinical trial determine safety , tolerability , efficacy Siltuximab ( Sylvant ) adjunct antipsychotic medication stable outpatient schizophrenia . Siltuximab ( structural formula C6450H9932N1688O2016S50 ) recombinant chimeric ( human-murine ) anti-human interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) monoclonal antibody . Siltuximab formulate concentrate solution infusion , administer intravenous infusion . The investigator propose 9-week randomized control trial siltuximab , give adjunct antipsychotic , N=30 stable outpatient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder evidence increase inflammation peripheral blood ( high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [ hsCRP ] &gt; 0.5 mg/dL ) . The investigator hypothesize adjunctive treatment siltuximab associate significant improvement cognition compare placebo patient schizophrenia , baseline IL-6 level higher siltuximab-treated responder versus non-responders , great decrease hsCRP baseline week 6 siltuximab-treated versus placebo-treated responder , response define ≥0.5 SD improvement cognition . Siltuximab administer intravenous infusion every 3 week . Following screen evaluation , participant receive three infusion siltuximab , one baseline , another week 3 study , another week 6 . The investigator measure change cognitive function symptom 9-week period . Complementing previous positive clinical trial non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , would `` proof-of-concept '' study target specific cytokine viable treatment schizophrenia . Interleukin 6 receptor discover clone Osaka University , Japan , Tadamitsu Kishimoto 1980s . Janssen Pharmaceuticals , Inc. begin clinical development siltuximab treatment multicentric Castleman 's disease , rare blood disorder . Other clinical study siltuximab conduced patient B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , multiple myeloma , ovarian cancer . In April 2014 , siltuxiumab approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( US FDA ) Sylvant human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -negative human herpesvirus-8 ( HHV-8 ) -negative multicentric Castleman 's disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A pathophysiological role inflammation schizophrenia one endure finding field . Recently , increase understanding complex interaction inflammation brain chronic disease well inform relationship schizophrenia . Several trial find treatment non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , adjunct antipsychotic , associate significant improvement psychopathology schizophrenia . Cytokines key regulator inflammation exert effect periphery brain . Serum cytokine level predict response two study , another study find trend improve cognition adjunctive NSAID treatment . These finding provide important empirical support pathophysiological role inflammation patient schizophrenia . Two important limitation trial : ) agent investigate relevant off-target ( i.e. , non-immune ) effect , b ) evidence inflammation peripheral blood inclusion criterion , may decrease signal-to-noise ratio . Schizophrenia associate impaired cognition , persist despite current treatment , important determinant quality life overall function . Converging line evidence suggest interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) promise therapeutic target cognitive impairment schizophrenia . IL-6 cytokine produce peripheral blood leukocyte , central nervous system ( CNS ) microglia astrocyte . The IL-6 gene risk factor schizophrenia may impact serum IL-6 level . Blood cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) IL-6 level alter schizophrenia . IL-6 level associate psychopathology cognition schizophrenia . Serum IL-6 level also increase prodromal psychosis , drug-naïve first-episode psychosis ( FEP ) first-degree relative patient schizophrenia . In population outside schizophrenia , high serum IL-6 level associate poor cognition , cognitive decline , small hippocampal volume . In FEP chronic schizophrenia , IL-6 level significant predictor small leave hippocampal volume . Evidence animal study also support putative role IL-6 pathophysiology schizophrenia . A single maternal injection IL-6 mouse pregnancy cause prepulse latent inhibition deficit adult offspring . In rat prenatal immune activation model , adult offspring increase serum IL-6 level , age homology usual age onset schizophrenia , modulate antipsychotic . Ketamine-induced neuronal production IL-6 responsible activation brain N=nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) -oxidase dysfunction fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing interneurons . Along previous work , preliminary study provide strong evidence IL-6 novel therapeutic target cognitive impairment schizophrenia , demonstrate feasibility propose trial . Briefly , 64 patient schizophrenia , investigator find high blood IL-6 level significant predictor great impairment Brief Assessment Cognition Schizophrenia ( BACS ) control multiple potential confounding factor . In 8-week open-label trial 6 subject , tocilizumab ( anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody ) , give adjunct antipsychotic , well tolerate associate significant improvement BACS verbal fluency 4 week , BACS digit symbol cod 2 , 4 , 8 week , BACS composite score 4 8 week . In first year follow submission , one clinical trial plan . The investigator conduct 9-week randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial determine safety , tolerability , efficacy siltuximab adjunct antipsychotic medication 30 stable outpatient schizophrenia . Siltuximab use treatment schizophrenia , use way experimental . The risk find people multicentric Castleman 's disease know , may unknown risk use schizophrenia . Clinically significant adverse drug reaction include anaphylaxis , renal failure , pneumonia . Known side effect siltuximab common include : swelling extremity , fatigue , itching , rash , weight gain , diarrhea , abdominal pain , joint limb pain . The common side effect drug nasopharyngitis , occur 63 % subject long-term exposure Siltuximab . Subjects schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder access outpatient psychiatry clinic Augusta University satellite collaborative site . The study 5 visit : screening , baseline , week 3 , 6 , 9 . Subjects randomize equally either siltuximab ( n=15 ) placebo ( n=15 ) , adjunct current antipsychotic psychotropic medication . The study 5 visit : screening , baseline , week 3 , 6 , 9 . Subjects randomize equally either siltuximab ( n=15 ) placebo ( n=15 ) , adjunct current antipsychotic psychotropic medication . Subjects siltuximab group receive 11 mg/kg infusion baseline , week 3 6 , per recommend dosing multicentric Castleman 's disease . Subjects placebo group receive infusion normal saline ( packaging volume siltuximab group ) baseline , week 3 6 . Subjects monitor additional 30 minute follow completion infusion . Dr. Miller monitor subject throughout infusion 30 minute post-infusion period . The investigator contact subject phone day 1 7 infusion ass infusion-related event . The investigator assess cognition psychopathology baseline , week 3 , 6 , 9 . The investigator also measure multiplex panel blood cytokine ( include IL-6 ) tryptophan catabolites baseline , week 3 , 6 , 9 . At Screening , subject administer evaluation sign consent , informed consent , structure clinical interview Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSM ) psychosis affective disorder module . The investigator perform medical history physical exam , fast lab ( complete blood count [ CBC ] , complete metabolic profile [ CMP ] , hsCRP , lipid panel , urinalysis , urine drug screen ( UDS ) , hepatitis panel , HIV , rapid plasma reagin [ RPR ] , human chorionic gonadotropin [ hCG ] female ) , tuberculin skin test , 12-lead electrocardiogram . At Baseline , investigator perform Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) , BACS , Clinical Global Impressions scale ( CGI ) , Calgary Depression Scale ( CDS ) Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ) draw blood IL-6 high-sensitivity c-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) . At Week 3 , 6 , 9 , investigator perform interval history , physical exam , PANSS , BACS , CGI , CDS , SF-36 , obtain fast lab ( CBC , CMP , lipid panel , hsCRP , urinalysis , UDS , hCG female ) . Different version BACS use avoid practice effect . Patients withdrawn meet exclusion criterion time point .</detailed_description>
