	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer second lead cause cancer death North American men older 50 year . Prostate specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) unique membrane bound glycoprotein , overexpressed manifold prostate cancer cell well-characterized image biomarker prostate cancer . Positron emission tomography / computer tomography ( PET/CT ) nuclear medicine procedure base measurement positron emission radiolabeled tracer molecule . 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA ( DKFZ-11 ) ( abbreviate 68Ga-PSMA ) tracer prostate cancer PET imaging . The strength functional imaging method distinguish tissue accord metabolism rather structure . Studies show PET/CT image 68Ga-PSMA detect prostate cancer lesion excellent contrast high detection rate even level prostate specific antigen low . Study Objectives : The objective study evaluate patient-wide SUVmax 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT locoregional metastatic prostate cancer correlate histopathologic Gleason score initial biopsy . It hypothesize SUVmax correlate positively Gleason score . This interest non-invasive risk stratification may possible future . This single-site JGH-only open label study one ( 1 ) 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT perform study participant . A PET/CT scan take 2-3 hour .</brief_summary>
