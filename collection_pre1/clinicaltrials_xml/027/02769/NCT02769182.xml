	<brief_summary>The main objective research develop validate technology-based solution address diminish mobility , increase fall risk impair cognitive function common among old adult , enable live longer successfully independently .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Validation Smart Phone Based System Enhance Gait , Cognition Socialization Elderly Fallers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A comprehensive system develop promote mobility , enhance cognitive function , reduce sedentary behavior , increase independence encourage social inclusion . This novel system two distinct yet complementary feature : monitoring treatment serve `` one system '' . The system consist wearable sensor proprietary develop application . The wearable inertial sensor measure acceleration orientation foot movement . The sensor fee real-time data system , process data use set proprietary algorithm enable continuous monitoring activity , gait fall risk , independence . In addition , designate application direct cognitive assessment training old adult home community environment also use via Smart phone mobile tablet . The training , physical cognitive , also include multi-user interaction .Data collected system process integrated provide comprehensive feedback multiple domains user , caregiver clinician way recommendation personalize treatment goal .</detailed_description>
