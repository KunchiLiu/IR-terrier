	<brief_summary>Background : Endocrine glands give hormone . Researchers want learn disorder affect glands child . These disorder might cause change gene . Genes contain DNA , blueprint cell work . Researchers want identify gene involve endocrine metabolic disorder . This might help develop new way diagnose treat disorder . Objective : To study inheritance endocrine metabolism disorder . Eligibility : Children age 0 18 know suspected endocrine metabolism disorder . Family member age 0 100 . They may participate DNA part study . Design : Participants screen review medical record . Their parent guardian allow record release . Participants clinic visit . This may include physical exam medical history . Parents guardian give consent study . Participants may test , surgery , procedure help diagnose treat condition . These could include : Blood , urine , saliva test Growth hormone test Pituitary adrenal function test Picture chromosomes Imaging test . These may include X-ray , ultrasound , scan , skeletal survey . Genetic test Sleep study Medical photograph If surgery do , tissue sample take . Participants may follow-up visit diagnosis treatment . Participating relatives one visit . This include medical history blood saliva test . The blood saliva use DNA test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol design allow endocrine-related evaluation child know suspected endocrine metabolic disorder . Children endocrine metabolic-related condition ( ) may may eligible specific NICHD research protocol , may evaluate auspex protocol advance clinical skill physicians participate NICHD clinical research training program , provide stimuli new clinical research initiative . Standard medically-indicated laboratory radiological study may perform confirm diagnosis aid management patient . In case , child participant may receive medical surgical treatment disorder National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center ( CC ) accord current clinical practice . The overall purpose endocrine evaluation protocol support clinical training research mission . Family member child evaluate protocol ( informative meiotic inheritance relationship proband index case ) may enrol genetic/DNA test part protocol .</detailed_description>
