	<detailed_description>Women postmenopausal period suffer hormonal change contribute number negative factor health , reduce bone mineral density loss muscle mass , contribute increase incidence fall consequent risk fracture . Among possibility alleviate symptom mainly drug treatment systematic regular physical exercise . However , drug treatment primarily involve hormone replacement therapy , associate increase risk heart disease , stroke breast cancer . Thus , exercise stand offer adverse effect , however , come bone metabolism , yet clear type exercise effective woman postmenopausal period . One form physical exercise recently investigate whole-body vibration ( WBV ) , characterize individual placement vibrate plate capable transmit vertical acceleration musculoskeletal system , however , intensity ( frequency magnitude ) ideal allow increase bone metabolism establish remain controversial . Other form exercise recommend postmenopausal woman , muscular endurance . Exercises involve strength training , use weight contribute improvement bone mineral density woman postmenopausal period . Another form exercise also offer endurance Pilates method . However , effect technique bone mineral density , investigate , despite show potential contribution variable pain , functional capacity quality life postmenopausal woman . This study justify still shortages literature evidence benefit vibration training ; also Pilates , bone mineral density postmenopausal woman . There also still little information much vibration train influence muscle strength , flexibility , postural balance , fear fall population 's quality life question .</detailed_description>
