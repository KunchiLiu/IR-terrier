	<brief_summary>Background : CRLX101 consist sugar molecule cyclodextrin link chemotherapy drug call camptothecin . The combined molecule nanoparticle drug conjugate travel blood . Once inside cancer cell , chemotherapy drug release molecule . Olaparib drug may stop cancer cell repair DNA damage cause chemotherapy . Researchers want see safe give CRLX101 olaparib together see well combination treat specific type lung cancer call small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . Objectives : To test safety maximum dose CLRX101 olaparib together . To test well treat small cell lung cancer . Eligibility : Adults 18 old small cell lung cancer . Design : Participants screen standard cancer care test . Participants get 2 study drug 28-day cycle . CRLX101 give every 2 week , small plastic tube arm vein . Olaparib take mouth twice day day . Participants keep pill diary . For Cycle 1 , participant 3 visit . All cycle 2 visit . At study visit , participant may : Blood hair sample take History Physical exam Questions health side effect Pregnancy test Optional tumor biopsy piece tumor remove needle numbing skin . . CT scan Injection CRLX101 ( twice per cycle ) &lt; TAB &gt; Olaparib prescription &lt; TAB &gt; Participants follow-up visit 4 week finish take drug . They physical exam blood test . They may tumor biopsy . The study team call patient every 3 month follow complete study treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial CRLX101 , Nanoparticle Camptothecin With Olaparib People With Relapsed/Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) aggressive cancer poor prognosis . - Although highly responsive chemotherapy initially , SCLC relapse quickly become refractory treatment within month . - The use PARP inhibitor combination chemotherapy build upon pre-clinical data lung cancer cancer support notion PARP inhibitor potentiate effect DNA damaging therapy . - Despite highly synergistic activity preclinical model , human study combine PARP inhibitor camptothecins translate clinical benefit due enhance toxicity combination . - One approach improve ability combine camptothecins agent sensitize activity like PARP inhibitor use alternative formulation minimize toxicity normal tissue . - CRLX101 nanoparticle drug conjugate compose 20 ( S ) -camptothecin ( potent highly selective topoisomerase I inhibitor ) conjugate linear , cyclodextrinpolyethylene glycol-based polymer . - Olaparib PARP inhibitor indicate monotherapy patient deleterious suspect deleterious germline BRCA mutate advanced ovarian cancer treat three prior line chemotherapy . Olaparib establish safety profile investigation number different cancer . Objectives : - Phase I : To determine MTD/ recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) CRLX101 combination olaparib patient refractory cancer - Phase II : To determine antitumor activity olaparib plus CRLX101 respect progression free survival 16 week separately SCLC patient resistant sensitive relapse Eligibility : Phase I - Male female adult patient great equal 18 year age - Histologically cytologically confirm , advance solid tumor refractory standard therapy and/or standard therapy available - ECOG Performance Status 0 , 1 2 Phase II - Male female patient great equal 18 year old - Have pathologically ( histology cytology ) confirm diagnosis SCLC - Disease progression least one platinum-based standard chemotherapy regimen either limited extensive stage disease . - Have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 - ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 Design : - Patients meet eligibility criterion receive CRLX101 ( IV Q 2weeks ) plus olaparib ( PO BID day 3-13 day 17-26 administered 28 day cycle , disease progression development intolerable side effect . The MTD combination use Phase II . - Blood , tumor hair sample collect multiple time point PK , PD analyse . Tumor biopsies optional perform SCLC patient ( Phase I II ) follow time point : pre-treatment , cycle 1 day 4 disease progression . - Toxicity grade accord CTCAE version 4.0 . - Tumor assessment make use CT scan ( chest , abdomen pelvis ) baseline every 2 cycle accord RECIST version 1.1 . - After discontinuation study treatment , follow-up survival carry every 3 month . - The maximum number patient phase I portion trial 30 two cohort phase II may accrue 20 evaluable patient . Thus , maximum number evaluable patient may enroll trial 70 . In order allow small number in-evaluable patient , accrual ceiling set 75 . - It anticipate approximately 1 2 patient per month may enroll onto trial ; trial expect complete accrual 3-4 year .</detailed_description>
