	<brief_summary>The present study aim investigate whether transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) reduce auditory hallucination patient psychosis . In addition , neuronal change tDCS examine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcranial Brain Stimulation Its Underlying Neural Mechanisms Novel Treatment Auditory Hallucinations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority patient psychosis experience hallucination , particularly auditory hallucination frequent . The hallucination often lead massive distress impairment social functioning sometimes even order patient commit act violence others . The standard treatment auditory hallucination antipsychotic medication . However , side‐effects severe 25‐30 % patient respond medication . Transcranial direct current stimulation non-invasive brain stimulation technique , modulate cortical excitability pain-free free mild transient adverse effect , . Typically , cortical excitability underneath anode boost cathodal stimulation inhibitory effect . Previous study find 2 daily session 20 min tDCS five subsequent day may reduce auditory hallucination . Investigators want assess efficacy tDCS sample large enough detect medium large effect . In addition , investigator want investigate neural mechanism underlie tDCS treatment examine various neuroimaging parameter , immediately treatment , 3 month treatment .</detailed_description>
