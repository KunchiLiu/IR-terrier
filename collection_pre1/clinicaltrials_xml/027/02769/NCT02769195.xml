	<brief_title>Utility Measure Lupus Low Disease Activity State ( LLDAS ) SLE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) multisystem autoimmune disease estimate incidence 5-50 case per 100,000 people . Despite advance therapy , still significant mortality morbidity associate disease . There clearly define treatment goal SLE , hinder development treat target approach evaluation new therapy . Although remission aim , rarely occur . A achievable clinical state treatment goal low disease activity describe recently preliminary single centre validation study demonstrate association improve outcomes . This endpoint term Lupus Low Disease Activity State ( LLDAS ) . The propose study ass discriminant validity propose LLDAS criterion clinical trial dataset . The objective research validate Lupus Low Disease Activity State ( LLDAS ) tool study endpoint SLE . The data available belimumab BLISS trial use evaluate LLDAS score . The outcome study validation LLDAS instrument clinical trial dataset , first time . This allow future study consider incorporate LLDAS attainment trial endpoint , example allow comparison frequency achieve LLDAS discriminate treatment . The finding interpret use statistical method publish / present public peer via peer-reviewed publication , conference presentation , relevant lay medium .</detailed_description>
