	<brief_summary>In patient advanced volume overload , minimally invasive ultrafiltration treatment acute phase positive effect clinical outcome . The aim collect treatment data context prospective registry safety performance minimally invasive ultrafiltration . The data record via electronic case report form ( eCRF ) ; eCRF run server locate Germany complies current data protection regulation . It intend include 300-500 patient advanced volume overload minimum 10 site . In addition , data disease management programme ( in-body measurement home monitoring ) record 40 patient . The treatment data patient record 12 month . An interim analysis perform 150 patient observe 6 month . The knowledge ultrafiltration volume overload obtain registry , case combination disease management programme , intend improve body evidence . In addition , data use hypothesis generation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There may various reason increase accumulation fluid occur tissue . The common cause include heart failure , kidney failure cirrhosis liver . In rare case , oedema develop follow septicaemia . The usual treatment oedema involve diuretic , i.e . water tablet , remove excess fluid body administer either orally intravenously . For year , also possible use ultrafiltration treat oedema . This involve filter remove excess fluid blood . This individual method enables precisely define amount fluid withdrawn . Access blood circulation usually via central venous catheter , acute dialysis . Current international treatment guideline recommend consideration give ultrafiltration therapy context treatment diuretic-resistant volume overload ( e.g . second- third-line therapy acute decompensated heart failure ) . There , however , date clinical data combine treatment regimen diuretic supportive ultrafiltration . Accordingly , ultrafiltration may include clinical guideline either low level evidence ( e.g . IIb ACCF/AHA guideline ) ( ESC guideline ) . The main reason limit body evidence ultrafiltration , one hand , invasive nature usual procedure ( usually require insertion central venous catheter ) structural barrier health system ( ultrafiltration normally offer nephrologists cardiologist ) . With increase clinical need limit medical alternative , particularly view frequently occur diuretic resistance heart failure , urgent medical need fill gap evaluation evidence . In context registry , CHIARA system , minimally invasive ( i.e . via peripheral venous access ) extracorporeal ultrafiltration system , use treatment decompensated volume overload . The CHIARA system CE mark intend purpose ultrafiltration blood patient suffer heart failure , acute chronic renal failure excess body fluid . It plan use medical device connection intend purpose . In participate hospital , patient treat new treatment strategy minimally invasive ultrafiltration treatment support diuretic drug therapy acute phase volume overload . It possible use ultrafiltration therapy control volume overload reduce individual basis , diuretic give sparingly , consequence , diuretic resistance deterioration renal function due diuretic uptitration avoid .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>≥18 year Inpatienttreated patient acute volume overload , preferably association cardiac decompensation sign incipient diuretic resistance ( lack increase urine output despite significant escalation diuretic therapy ; e.g . ≥80 mg furosemide / 24 h less 1375 mL urine output/40 mg furosemide per 24 h equivalent dose loop diuretic [ establish clinically medical history ] ) New York Association Functional Class ( NYHA ) IIIIV inclusion Systolic diastolic cardiac dysfunction ( HFREF HFPEF ) Adequate venous access ( preferably peripheral arm vein ) allow flow rate ≥ 60 mL / min Written consent use data registry ( necessary , legal guardian ) . Contraindication anticoagulation ( e.g . know heparininduced thrombocytopenia , severe bleeding ) Terminal renal failure ( stage V , GFR &lt; 15 mL ) Cardiogenic shock , e.g . association acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) Other disease factor , study doctor 's opinion , constitute potential contraindication ultrafiltration Pregnant woman , woman labour , breastfeed woman woman childbearing potential , without adequate contraception plan family . NB : pregnancy test perform systematically woman childbearing age patient include event pregnancy ( positive test ) . It absolutely essential woman , negative test include study , effective contraception .</criteria>
