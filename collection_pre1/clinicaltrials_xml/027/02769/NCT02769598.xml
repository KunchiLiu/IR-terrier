	<detailed_description>Fighting pain cause disease diagnostic therapeutic procedure child daily essential concern health care pediatric sector . The quantification pain need effectively adjust analgesic therapy limit side effect treatment . Nowadays many scale validate child , base one-off measure hetero assessment often subjective dependent many factor include presence staff child 's side . Recent development analysis cardiac signal real time influence autonomic control , lead development new painful stress quantification index . A monitor recently develop provide index nociception analgesia ( ANI index ) . It base study variability heart rate control change sympathetic parasympathetic system response stimulus . Clinical correlation complete adult patient general anesthesia . The validation nociception index validate pediatric care sector particular attention give control pain . The main purpose study show consistency index compare validate pain scale use routinely non-sedated child hospitalize pediatric intensive care unit . This study base real-time analysis perception pain child . It critical validation step could dramatically change treatment pediatric patient intensive care pediatric intensive care unit facilitate real-time patient management . The caregiver opportunity fine tune effective treatment . The validation stool allow pain measure child highly sedate present neuromotor handicap .</detailed_description>
