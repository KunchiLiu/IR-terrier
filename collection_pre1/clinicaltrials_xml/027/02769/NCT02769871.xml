	<brief_title>Effect Stroke Neuro-images Smoking Cessation Patients With New Stroke .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize show actual image patient 's stroke participant either brain CT MRI similarly easy understand quantification damage do participant 's body . Given link smoke stroke risk , investigator believe provide image addition standard smoking cessation education may improve rate smoke cessation stroke . If prof true , addition patient 's neuroimaging standard post-stroke smoking cessation education would easy method improve smoke cessation rate stroke patient , minimal cost .</detailed_description>
