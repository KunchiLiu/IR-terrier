This study propose retest AD cohort 18-60 month first test characterize change EEG/ERP measure correlate longitudinal change neuropsychological testing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EEG/ERP Longitudinal Study Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study NCT00582127 , two age-matched cohort ( mild AD , n=98 healthy control , n=100 ) recruit 7 clinical site undergo broad range clinical , neuropsychological , neuroelectrophysiological test . The complete battery ADNI neuropsychological test perform mild AD subject well standard blood test MRI use ADNI protocol . MRI volumetry analysis perform MRI data . Both cohort undergo 3-minute EEG record event-related potential ( ERP ) test use standard 2-deviant auditory oddball paradigm COGNISION ( tm ) System Neuronetrix . The study show specific EEG/ERP feature could use discriminate mild AD cohort healthy control . The current study intend follow NCT00582127.AD subject successfully complete COGNISION™ psychometric test previous study eligible part present follow . In first part current study , de-identified cognitive functional data AD patient sit collected regular check ups test original Neuronetrix study share study Sponsor . The retrospective chart review three main objective : - Quantify rate cognitive functional decline patient . - Investigate whether ERP and/or qEEG data collect test original Neuronetrix study provide insight subsequent rate cognitive functional decline . - Identify study subject might still functional enough successfully complete follow-up ERP/qEEG test . These subject offer opportunity come back sit follow-up ERP/qEEG psychometric testing . Up 40 subject invite back site . Subjects choose enroll second part study ERP/qEEG test administer Neuronetrix certify test administrator . Subjects complete test successfully move clinical evaluation psychometric testing . Results obtain part study compare ERP/qEEG psychometric data complete Neuronetrix study mention . The two main objective comparison : - Investigate whether ERP qEEG measure collect outpatient setting show significant change time subject AD . - Correlate longitudinal change ERP qEEG measure ( ) cognitive functional decline measure psychometric test .</detailed_description>
