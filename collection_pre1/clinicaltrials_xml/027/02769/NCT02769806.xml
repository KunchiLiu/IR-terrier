	<brief_summary>The primary aim project Compare new msCS standard DSC-PWI method GBM patient undergo post-operative MRI monitoring tumor progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Advanced Perfusion MRI Treatment Response Progression Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators compare novel standard DSC-PWI method twenty five GBM patient determine whether novel method improve image quality tumor region . We also compare accuracy pseudoprogression ( PsP ) vs. early progressive disease ( ePD ) determination two technique . If successful , project culminate novel image method sequence optimize monitor progression guide treatment decision post-operative GBM patient .</detailed_description>
