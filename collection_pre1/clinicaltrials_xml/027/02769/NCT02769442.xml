	<brief_title>Prospective , Randomized Controlled Comparison TERUMO SurFlash Plus Versus BD Insyte Autoguard Urban ED</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rational Study Emergency department ( ED ) patient frequently require rapid , short-term intravenous ( IV ) access diagnosis treatment emergency medical condition . IV access uncomfortable painful patient . Therefore ensure first attempt success important . Furthermore , give time-sensitive nature emergent medical condition , immediate success help minimize delay analgesic medication administration , resuscitation therapeutic intervention . The process obtain IV access potential operator exposure blood-borne pathogen . After tourniquet place extremity , positive venous pressure force blood catheter lure lock apply . Traditional IV catheter require operator kink catheter apply pressure body catheter mitigate degree blood leakage simultaneously connect lure lock . This complicated process often lead blood contamination insertion site , environment , include potential blood spillage bedding , ground operator . In addition potential blood-born pathogen exposure , spillage lead patient care delay , require prompt cleaning . Terumo Medical Corp. , lead manufacturer medical device , introduce novel IV access catheter ( already FDA approve ) feature promise increase first attempt success decrease blood contamination insertion process . The Terumo SurFlash Plus catheter technology produce visible flash blood end catheter needle place vessel second flash catheter needle confirm proper catheter placement vein . Furthermore , new catheter proprietary safety valve minimize risk blood exposure needle removal IV lure lock attachment . This study would analyze unique property ( first skin puncture success insertion site blood contamination ) high volume , urban emergency department time safety IV access critical . Purpose Study Primary Objective : Compare rate first-skin puncture success use Terumo SurFlash Plus compare BD Insyte Autoguard . Secondary Objective : Compare frequency severity blood contamination insertion site two aforementioned device . Research Design This prospective , randomize control study Terumo SurFlash Plus IV catheter versus current standard ED IV catheter ( BD Insyte Autoguard ) . Study device : The Terumo SurFlash Plus catheter FDA approve already use multiple medical center United States . Gauge size 18 , 20 22 provide TERUMO ED cost hospital . IV inserters ( operator ) Mercy Medical Center emergency department technician , nurse provider routinely obtain IV access ED .</detailed_description>
