	<brief_summary>Uveitis acute chronic inflammatory condition unknown etiology . Although uveitis often respond adequately topical corticosteroid , many patient treatment either inadequate tolerate . A patient inadequate response treatment would manifest uveitis activity slit lamp examination determination anterior chamber cellularity . Lack tolerance therapy commonly manifest ocular hypertension ( great 21 mmHg measure tonometry ) complicate chronic topical corticosteroid administration , lead glaucoma permanent visual loss . Moreover , systemic corticosteroid may require dose unsafe chronic administration . In situation , immunosuppressive medication often add `` steroid-sparing '' agent . If clinical response add immunosuppressive , oral and/or topical corticosteroid dose reduce eliminate avoid toxicity . There several reason believe Acthar might beneficial treatment uveitis patient . In addition increase adrenal production cortisol , Acthar another important mechanism action mediate bind melanocortin receptor . Melanocortin down-regulates activity B T lymphocytes , monocyte macrophage . In animal study , melanocortin peptide down-regulate T helper cell , up-regulate T Regulatory cell , decrease B lymphocyte production B Lymphocyte Stimulator . In macrophage , down-regulation IL-1 , IL-2 , INF gamma , TNF alpha , nitric oxide adhesion molecule . In cell , addition IL-10 upregulation ( monocyte ) , down-regulation VACM ECAM ( endothelial cell ) , prostaglandin ( fibroblast ) MCP-1 RANTES ( renal tubule ) .CNS mediation systemic inflammation may also down-regulated melanocortin receptor bind Acthar .</brief_summary>
