	<detailed_description>The study aim evaluate possible effect exercise program , nutritional psychological , postural orientation guidance oral health body composition , physical activity level lifestyle , health-related physical fitness motor performance factor risk cardiovascular disease , eat habit , cognition level , psychological profile body posture adolescent overweight obesity . In addition , identify effect orientation oral health quality life healthy oral habit . A quasi-experimental research consist sample approximately fifty adolescent overweight obesity , age 10 17 , sex , select voluntarily two school Santa Cruz Sul . The session last two hour ( one hour physical exercise second time divide nutritional counseling , postural , psychological oral orientation ) frequency three time week . The exercise session consist 10 minute warm-up , 40 minute aerobic exercise , recreational sport activity ( moderate severe ) 10 minute back calm , intensity activity monitor frequency ( target heart rate : 60 70 % maximum heart rate subject ) .

The following parameter evaluate : anthropometric ( BMI , waist circumference skinfold thickness ) ; hematologic biochemical analysis ( HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , total cholesterol , triglyceride , glucose , insulin , adiponectin , leptin , resistin , C reative protein , ALT , AST , glycated hemoglobin , IL-6 , IL-10 , TNF-Î± , cortisol , irisina , F2 isoprostane uric acid ) ; polymorphism relate obesity ( FTO rs9939609 ) ; related-health physical fitness ( flexibility ; sit reach test ; abdominal strength cardiorespiratory fitness ) ; postural deviation evaluate photogrammetry method - SAPO program . The nutritional habit lifestyle assess self-report validate adapted questionnaire Brazilian child adolescent well recall diet calculation nutrient Virtual Nutri 1.0 . Oral health evaluate accord criterion SB Brazil Project 2010 . The psychological cognitive assessment do instrument determine self-esteem , body awareness , stress possible mental health problem adolescent . The result present means statistical test perform use SPSS 23.0 . The comparison average value variables pre- post-intervention carry Anova test repeat measure ( generalize linear model ) , subsequent calculation effect size ; two-way ANOVA use analyze difference among change control group experimental group . Expected result : It expect completion research project , increase level cardiorespiratory fitness , flexibility abdominal strength , change postural deviation dietary habit , increase cognitive function psychological aspect improve hygiene perception oral health adolescent overweight obesity consequent reduction rate overweight obesity risk factor cardiovascular disease . The aim collaborate public health policy prevention treatment overweight obesity consequence school .</detailed_description>
