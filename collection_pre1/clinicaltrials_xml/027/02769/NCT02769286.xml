	<brief_title>Osimertinib First Second Line Treatment NSCLC Harboring EGFR Mutations From Circulating Tumor DNA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , open-label , single centre study AZD9291 administer orally patient advance lung cancer activate mutation EGFR gene without T790M detect circulate tumor DNA . EGFR-TKI naïve patient activate EGFR mutation enrol cohort 1 . Patients acquire resistance prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) due T790M mutation go enrol cohort 2 .</detailed_description>
