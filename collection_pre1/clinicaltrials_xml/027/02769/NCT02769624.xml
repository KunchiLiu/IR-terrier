	<brief_summary>In pilot study investigator propose explore effect locally deliver inhaled pulmonary vasodilator ( inhaled treprostinil ) exercise performance , pulmonary blood flow , venous pressure response vascular function stable Fontan patient . Investigators also assess effect rest acute rise exercise induce systemic venous pressure liver stiffness also assess whether treprostinil attenuate acute stiffness increase investigator expect see . This prospective , randomize , double-blinded placebo control , crossover trial . Following recruitment inform consent , participant undergo three study visit , include baseline testing ( visit 1 ) , follow two set exercise vascular function test ( visit 2 visit 3 ) CCHMC . Twenty-six patient enrol study .</brief_summary>
