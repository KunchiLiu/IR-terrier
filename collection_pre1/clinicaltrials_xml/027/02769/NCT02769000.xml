	<brief_title>Low Dose RT Reduce Cerebral Amyloidosis Early Alzheimer 's</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) currently 7th lead cause death United States approximately 5.9 million Americans live progressive debilitate condition . AD predominantly affect old individual 86 % AD case individual 65 year age old . Further , approximately $ 172 billion health care spending annually attribute cost associate AD care top 11 million caregiver provide care unpaid capacity , family member , friend , etc . In 1975 , cohort nearly 2,800 people 65 year age free dementia provide basis incident study dementia , well Alzheimer 's disease . This cohort follow almost 29 year sentinel finding include significantly high lifetime risk Alzheimer 's dementia woman compare men . The estimated lifetime risk nearly one five woman compare one ten men . In addition high lifetime risk woman , expectancy longer life age `` baby boomer '' combine improve healthcare expect increase number Americans reach 85 year age . It clear age increase , incidence Alzheimer 's form dementia . Between 2010 2050 , expect 30 % increase number individual great 85 year age . Although absolute number may appear significant , increase approximately 17 million people challenge healthcare system cost associate deal various acute chronic medical condition include AD . While major cause death continue experience decline , AD continue rise . In 1991 , approximately 14,000 death certificate record Alzheimer 's disease underlying cause . In 2006 , note increase approximately 46 % Alzheimer 's disease list direct cause death . This significant compare present lead cause death , heart disease , decrease 11 % time . From neurophysiological standpoint , know Alzheimer 's disease appear progressive process associate deposition β Amyloid . This appear trigger mechanism , cause phosphorylation TAU protein , lead development neurofibrillary tangle ( NFT ) , believe responsible memory loss , especially short-term associate problem Alzheimer 's related dementia . It also appear may selective deposition β Amyloid hippocampus prefrontal region , major short-term memory region brain . Extensive research ongoing try find various way excess deposition β Amyloid , removal excess β Amyloid , initiation sequence involve phosphorylated TAU selective process alter effort mitigate devastate end term result . To date , several trial , include vaccine trial perform Europe United States , seem show clearance β Amyloid possible . However , significant improvement neurocognitive function ( NCF ) , lead discontinuation trial . This lack improvement NCF believe secondary fact β Amyloid already result phosphorylation TAU protein development NFT . Thus removal initiator accomplish , end damage develop . Then consider irradiation ? The use radiation treatment non-oncologic human population enjoy long history recent renaissance . It commonly use prevent heterotopic bone formation re-development keloid heterotrophic scar post-operatively . It show randomized trial effectively treat planter fasciitis use post-operative treatment resect pterygium . It use treatment Hidradenitis suppurativa , Duputryen 's disease Ledderhose 's disease . These site routinely treat low dose fractionate external beam irradiation , commonly dose range 7 24 Gy . The use external irradiation also report treatment symptomatic systemic amyloidosis . In publish peer review article treatment site include trachea-pulmonary , ocular , laryngeal use conditioning agent autologous BMT patient systemic amyloidosis . These report use external beam irradiation range 5.5 - 45 Gy detail durable local control dos . Because effect , series basic science experiment initiate genetically alter mouse : B6 ; Cg - Tg 85 Dbo/J express amyloid B6 ; 129-Psen1tm1MpmTg express amyloid TAU , make prone early Alzheimer 's disease development . Both single fractionate CNS irradiation genetically alter mouse model test , show similar result reduction amyloid plaque number , size volume . Moreover , fractionated study investigator demonstrate statistically significant improvement treat mouse use Morris Water Maze Test compare control non-treated animal , effect hold whether animal adolescent , mature age ( 18 month old ) . The exact mechanism radiation therapy confers benefit Alzheimer 's disease mouse model difficult elucidate exact pathobiology Alzheimer 's disease know . Possible mechanisms include follow : reduction β amyloid reduce production increase clearance ; reduction Tau ; induction beneficial inflammatory mechanism ; induction inhibition heat shock protein ; alter cerebral microvasculature ; and/or reversal maladaptive neuroplasticity hippocampus . Investigations possible mechanism currently underway . One complication related study Alzheimer 's disease actual diagnosis . Unlike malignancy biopsy obtain , Alzheimer 's disease diagnosis exclusion make autopsy . While Europeans recently identify agree CSF biomarkers diagnosis Alzheimer 's disease , investigator accept premise United States . At present time , PET image utilizes various compound utilized identify deposition amyloid CNS . More recently , suggestive evidence specific type cataract may see high percentage patient Alzheimer 's disease relate possible β Amyloid deposition lens region ( 29-30 ) . Many rely NINCDS-ADRDA criterion clinical diagnosis Alzheimer 's disease . While diagnosis exclusion , well-accepted neurocognitive test ( NCT ) use monitor Alzheimer 's disease progression . The Mini Mental exam one general NCT use help establish diagnosis Alzheimer 's dementia . There sensitive neurocognitive test available track progression Alzheimer 's dementia , investigator use study . Note estimation premorbid IQ complete screen appointment administration BNT JLO occur baseline pre-treatment visit 12-months post-treatment follow visit minimize participant fatigue familiarity test material . Administration NCT screen visit serve two purpose . Data obtain screen visit ensure subject enrol trial meet criterion early AD base comprehensive battery test , diagnosis dementia improve use quantitative measurement multiple domain . The NCT screen visit also expose participant NCT since practice effect greatest first second exposure NCT , practice effect minimize use exposure repeat measure ANOVAs . Psychological functioning quality life ( QOL ) also evaluate monitor participant ' emotional status throughout trial . The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire use assess depression anxiety , respectively . If participant endorses suicidal ideation PHQ-9 , Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised ( SBQ-R ) administer fully evaluate participant 's suicidal ideation study stop rule implement needed ensure individual 's safety . QOL evaluate Quality Life Alzheimer 's disease ( QOL-AD ) Quality Life Late-stage Dementia ( QUALID ) Everyday Cognition ( ECog ) questionnaires ( patient caregiver form ) . Concern may raise regard use whole brain irradiation potential deleterious effect neurocognitive testing . There report post-radiation neurocognitive test set prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI ) , whole brain fractionate RT commonly employ patient pulmonary small cell carcinoma . The standard whole brain PCI dose 2.5 Gy x 10 , considerably high 2.0 Gy x 5 2.0 Gy x 10 scheme plan present study . Furthermore , patient PCI study also receive chemotherapy addition whole brain irradiation , chemotherapy effect long-term NCF . In PCI report , neurocognitive decline identify , modest , occur within short interval , e.g . 6-9 month , improve . The investigator thus propose 9-month follow period 1st subject cohort ( 2.0 Gy x 5 ) proceed 2nd cohort ( 2.0 Gy x 10 ) , although cohort undergo NCF QOL test 12 month . Grosshans colleague M. D. Anderson find PCI `` unlikely significantly affect NCF . '' They evaluate cognitive function small cell lung cancer patient receive PCI ( mean 2.5 Gy x 10 ) . After chemotherapy , PCI , 47 % already evidence impaired cognitive function . On multivariate analysis , significant decline PCI . On univariate analysis , unsustained , early decrease executive language function , persist follow-up . A Japanese group apply Hopkins Verbal Learning Test ( revise Japanese version , HVLT-R ) 40 whole brain RT patient , baseline , 4 month , 8 month . Whole brain fractionation either 2.5 Gy x 4 , 3.0 Gy x 10 , 2.5 Gy x 10 . The respective probability decline HVLT-R total recall 4 month , respectively , 40 % , 7 % , 0 % , 8 month 13 % , 14 % 0 % ( 48 ) . Also applicable recent report whole brain ( whole spine ) RT medulloblastoma child , population believe vulnerable cognitive decline RT . They receive chemotherapy , rather RT alone , 36 Gy 36 fraction ( 1.0 Gy BID ) entire brain spine , follow boost 68 Gy 68 fraction tumor bed , typically posterior fossa . Using Wechsler Intelligence Scale Children give verbal quotient , performance quotient , full-scale intelligence quotient , cognitive function preserve test domain throughout study 3 month , 1 year , 2 year , decline time . Low dose whole brain RT demonstrate safety many study , investigator use even low dos . These low radiation therapy dose history excellent success patient non-cerebral amyloidosis , durable response combine necropsy / neurocognitive test genetically alter Alzheimer 's disease mouse model , investigator decide proceed human trial , use fractionated whole brain radiation dose 2.0 Gy x 5 , 2.0 Gy x 10 . Subjects follow neurocognitive test 6 week , 3 , 9 12 month post RT . Additionally , give development supranuclear cataract report high percent AD patient , investigator recommend ocular test baseline 1 year assess potential abscopal effect , collateral benefit non-targeted lens treatment primary disease brain . With respect development cataract association AD , early accurate diagnosis Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) still challenge confirmatory diagnosis make presence feature include beta-amyloid plaque postmortem . In 2014 , Tian et al suggest AD may common pathophysiology supranuclear deposit beta-amyloid human lens . The brain lens tissue arise ectoderm tissue ( neuroectoderm surface ectoderm respectively ) . Their conclusion base meta-analysis study , provide mixed data regard correlation beta-amyloid lens sample patient AD , Down syndrome control . Given chronicity terminally differentiate cell type lens may affect Alzheimer disease 's pathology , conclude possibility ocular biomarker early AD may exist lens . This would suggest early ophthalmic examination may provide window hope early diagnosis AD . It may also provide opportunity early treatment perhaps monitor improvement supranuclear cataract systemic therapy . A precedent already find Wilson 's disease . Kayser-Fleischer ( K-F ) ring see Wilson 's disease ( WD ) due copper deposition Descemet 's membrane sclero-corneal junction eye . Although believed pathognomic WD , may see many hepatic condition intraocular copper-containing foreign body . The K-F ring detect pre-symptomatic case WD may lead speedy diagnosis early management . Co-relation K-F ring WD disease severity , disappearance successful treatment , reappearance non-compliant treatment aid management WD . K-F ring detection first-degree relative index case also important . With proposed ocular exam baseline 9-months post treatment , investigator hope detect cataract subject effect propose radiation treatment . The question investigator often encounter early Alzheimer 's whether improve ( abscopal effect ) radiation therapy , even though lens exclude RT treatment field . Exams do subject least one natural lense still present . Subjects previous cataract correction ocular exam perform .</detailed_description>
