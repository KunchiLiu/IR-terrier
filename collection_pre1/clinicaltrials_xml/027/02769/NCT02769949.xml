If eligible specific NICHD research protocol , patient genetic-related condition may evaluate auspex protocol advance clinical skill physicians participate NICHD clinical research training program , provide stimuli new clinical research initiative . Standard medically-indicated laboratory radiological study may perform confirm diagnosis aid management patient . In case , child participant may receive medical surgical treatment disorder NIH CC accord current clinical practice . The overall purpose genetic evaluation protocol support clinical training research mission . Family member child evaluate protocol ( informative meiotic inheritance relationship proband index case ) may enrol genetic/DNA test part protocol .</detailed_description>
