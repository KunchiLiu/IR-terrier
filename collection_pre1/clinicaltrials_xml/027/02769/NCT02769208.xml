	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether two different central air purification technology reduce air pollutant exposure beneficially influence health evaluate suite biological marker related cardiovascular respiratory disease risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Indoor Air Filtration Strategies Occupant Health Indicators</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study test two common type central air handle unit filtration technology , high-efficiency particulate air ( HEPA ) filter electrostatic precipitator ( ESPs ) , evaluate impact technology personal exposure air pollutant associate cardiovascular respiratory health outcome . HEPA filter remove high percentage particulate matter air , ESPs , ESPs also generate ozone , may detrimental health effect . These air purification technology place different combination coarse pre-filter protect air exchange machinery ( combination : pre-filter , pre-filter + HEPA , pre-filter + HEPA + ESP ) residences office study participant live factory campus Changsha , Hunan Province , China . Large dormitories office building central air handle unit common China around world , add air purification central duct represent practical strategy reduce personal exposure air pollution relate health outcome . The Changsha area commonly suffer high air pollution , dormitory office workspace already outfit HEPA filter ESPs . Therefore , test technology environment present natural experimental condition test benefit air purification . The study investigator hypothesize pre-filter + HEPA pre-filter + HEPA + ESP condition reduce particulate matter exposure reduce biological marker cardiovascular respiratory disease compare pre-filter alone , ESP generate enough ozone lead low health benefit HEPA+pre-filter condition .</detailed_description>
