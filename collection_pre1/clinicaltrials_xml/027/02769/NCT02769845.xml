	<brief_title>SACRED A Prospective Research Study Reduce Stroke Children With Sickle Cell Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SACRED involve three-part study design , outline , include ( 1 ) initial TCD evaluation phase ; ( 2 ) longitudinal TCD evaluation ; ( 3 ) treatment warrant . 1 . The initial evaluation portion SACRED involve obtain TCD examination child SCA age 3-15 year , follow Hospital Infantil Robert Reid Cabral Santo Domingo evaluate risk stroke . Up 500 patient enrol . All patient , include already hydroxyurea transfusion therapy ( whether stroke clinical indication ) , include obtain one-year cross-sectional description TCD velocities patient population . Patients already therapy identify elevated TCD velocity eligible treatment portion SACRED conditional elevate velocity would suggest present therapy optimize . 2 . In longitudinal portion SACRED , enrol child undergo yearly TCD examination . The goal serial examination help define natural history cerebrovascular disease , specifically determine incidence new conditional abnormal velocity . The goal obtain total 3 TCD examination per enrol patient , regardless treatment status . 3 . In treatment phase SACRED , child TCD velocity 170-199 cm/sec eligible protocol-directed hydroxyurea therapy . Most participant initiate hydroxyurea treatment already hydroxyurea conditional velocity receive dose optimization . Participants follow common study termination date , define 3 year first treatment . Participants abnormal TCD velocity ≥200 cm/sec commence transfusion therapy per current practice guideline clinical site . Patients already transfusion therapy identify conditional velocity also eligible hydroxyurea abnormal velocity may require re-calculation transfusion dosing .</detailed_description>
