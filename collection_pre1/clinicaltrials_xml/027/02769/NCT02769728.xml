	<brief_title>EndoBarrier Obese Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity diabetes probably represent challenge threat public health 21st century . Obesity multiple deleterious effect health , significantly increase risk fatal non-fatal disease include type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) . Bariatric surgery well-established method treatment morbid obesity increasingly recognize effective , long-lasting treatment option T2DM . Recently potential , non-invasive alternative bariatric surgery , duodenal-jejunal bypass liner ( EndoBarrierTM ) introduce . It endoscopically implantable removable device prevents contact partially digested nutrient proximal intestine . This device show reduce body weight improve glycaemic control subject diabetes . Small pilot study suggest change incretin level , similar observe gastric surgery improvement insulin sensitivity glucose metabolism . To good understand characterize hormonal and/or metabolic effect implantation removal EndoBarrierTM , monocentric , prospective , trial perform . The primary objective study clarify change gut peptide gut permeability implantation EndoBarrierTM obese subject sub-optimally control type 2 diabetes mellitus . Additionally , investigator aim determine change body weight measure adiposity , change global cardiovascular risk baseline 12 month well change insulin sensitivity beta-cell function time .</detailed_description>
