	<brief_title>Effect Acid Blockade Microbiota Inflammation Cystic Fibrosis ( CF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients cystic fibrosis ( CF ) significant morbidity mortality due airway infection . These infection relate deficiency mucociliary clearance due thick dehydrated secretion . Thus , considerable effort spend manage airway infection . This include therapy improve mucus clearance antibiotic treatment target important pathogen . Understanding source airway microbiota , increased risk infection , exacerbation critical improve management airway infection . A large proportion CF patient also treat anti-acid medication . These medication decrease symptom associate gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , improve efficacy enzyme replacement therapy . Critical proposal fact aspiration may represent potential route airway infection microorganism upper gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract , anti-acid treatment shift GI microbiota . In preliminary study identify strong alteration esophageal microbiota subject use acid block medication . Thus , treatment may significant effect bacterial community present upper GI tract may play role infection exacerbation CF . Traditionally , access upper GI tract require endoscopy acquire biopsy tissue , invasive procedure routinely perform CF . To circumvent invasive sampling require study esophagus recently show minimally invasive test , esophageal string test ( EST ) , capable sample upper GI tract , performance comparable biopsy number measurement include assessment esophageal microbiota . The primary hypothesis proposal acid blockade medication alters esophageal microbiota CF , increase presence pathogenic bacteria inflammation . To test hypothesis propose three Specific Aims : Specific aim 1 : Determine whether esophageal microbial composition child CF change withdrawal acid blockade 1 . Comparison esophageal bacterial load 16S qPCR subject acid blockade withdrawal 2 . Examine stability esophageal bacterial community base longitudinal collection esophageal string test ( EST ) prior withdrawal acid blockade treatment . 3 . Determine change withdrawal acid blockade sputum microbiota composition esophageal microbiota ( include presence pathogenic bacteria ) whether change correlate across two sample type . Specific aim 2 : Determine whether esophageal microbiota child CF change initiation acid blockade patient start clinical indication 1 . Comparison esophageal bacterial load 16S qPCR esophageal bacteria subject pre post acid blockade treatment . 2 . Examine stability esophageal bacterial community base longitudinal collection esophageal string test ( EST ) prior acid blockade treatment initiation . 3 . Determine change initiation acid blockade sputum microbiota composition esophageal microbiota ( include presence pathogenic bacteria ) whether change correlate across two sample type . Specific aim3 : Examine relation acid blockade medication inflammation association bacterial community subject aim 1 2 1 . CompareIL-8 esophagus subject without acid blockade 2 . Compare IL-8 sputum subject without acid blockade determine relation inflammation association shift bacterial community . Together , aim provide novel information regard impact acid blockade treatment esophageal lung microbiota may impact management respiratory disease CF . We anticipate similar effect acid blockade esophageal bacterial community observe non-CF pediatric adult subject , acknowledge treatment burden CF , particularly antibiotic , may affect expect outcome . These data provide critical information evaluate effect acid blockade infection risk , could affect therapeutic choice patient CF . The long-term goal study , improve patient care assess effect acid blocker therapy microbiota inflammation .</detailed_description>
