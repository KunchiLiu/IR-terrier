	<brief_summary>Treatment resistant motor feature , postural instability freeze gait common people Parkinson 's disease major contributor morbidity mortality . This project use sleep study , quantitative motor assessment magnetic resonance image examine relationship abnormally increase muscle activity rapid eye movement sleep development progression treatment-resistant postural instability gait disturbance . Specifically , investigator test hypothesis anticipatory postural adjustment ( weight pressure shift ) gait initiation significantly reduce people Parkinson 's disease abnormally elevated muscle activity rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep compare individual Parkinson 's disease whose REM sleep muscle activity normal . In addition , investigator test hypothesis level RSWA baseline predictive measure motor decline ( postural stability gait ) alteration structure function locomotor brainstem network . Since sleep disorder emerge year diagnosis Parkinson 's disease , establishment link sleep treatment-resistant posture gait disorder help identify individual risk develop disable motor feature disease .</brief_summary>
