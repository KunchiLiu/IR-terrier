	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Pembrolizumab Relapsed , Locally Recurrent Squamous Cell Cancer Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-center , open label , phase II study window opportunity component patient recurrent squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) treat adjuvant pembrolizumab follow salvage surgery . Forty-five ( 45 ) patient participate study determine disease-free survival probability 12 month . Secondary objective include assessment disease-free survival probability 2 year , overall survival , adverse event toxicity , immune molecular correlative . For window opportunity component , patient randomize 3:1 favor receive pembrolizumab 200 mg administer intravenously ( IV ) every three week maximum two dos , versus placebo prior salvage surgery . Approximately three six week follow first dose pembrolizumab , patient undergo salvage surgery . Tumor tissue blood collect time surgery immune correlative study .</detailed_description>
