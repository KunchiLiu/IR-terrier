	<brief_summary>This multicenter study validate panel serum , imaging , clinical biomarkers classify patient outcome early out-of-hospital pediatric cardiac arrest . Results expect positive immediate impact advance clinical care outcomes child . This work provide clinician , family , researcher superior tool assess severity brain injury early resuscitation order know risk brain injury may benefit neuroprotective intervention , monitor response intervention , plan rehabilitation strategy , optimize design research study test novel intervention improve neurological outcome cardiac arrest .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Children cardiac arrest ( CA ) mortality rate 50-90 % , largely due neurological failure part post-resuscitation syndrome . There critical gap knowledge tool accurately classify outcome pediatric CA . Physical examination laboratory test inadequately assess severity neurologic injury outcome . Hazards misclassification include risk adverse effect ineffective therapy non-treatment ostensibly well patient later find neurologic deficit . Early accurate identification eventual severity neurologic injury would allow timely neuroprotective intervention and/or target test new therapy specific risk population . The long term objective improve neurological outcome child survive CA . In study , investigator model validate serum image biomarkers brain injury empirical support , ass accuracy together clinical variable classify outcome pediatric CA . The central hypothesis serum image biomarkers brain injury , together clinical variable , critically aid early classification favorable outcome pediatric CA ( Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales score [ VABS ] &gt; 70 ) 1 year pediatric CA multicenter prospective study ( 8-12 center 248 subject ) . Strong preliminary data support hypothesis , biomarkers test outcome classification accuracy follow 3 specific aim : Aim 1 ) Serum biomarkers neuronal ( neuron specific enolase ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase-L1 ) glial injury ( S100b glial fibrillary acidic protein ) Aim 2 ) Regional ( occipital-parietal cortex , basal ganglion , thalamus ) brain MRI ( T1/T2 diffusion-weighted imaging ) magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) biomarkers neuronal injury ( N-acetyl-aspartate ) energy failure ( lactate ) Aim 3 model combination strong serum image biomarkers brain injury clinical variable . We assess serum biomarkers brain mitochondrial injury potential novel therapeutic target ( cardiolipin oxidize cardiolipin ) exploratory aim . This propose research innovative , combine panel serum image biomarkers clinical variable accurately classify outcome pediatric CA prospectively develop optimize . These propose aim leverage recent pilot success generate accurate reliable model biomarkers markedly improve post-resuscitation clinical care child CA . Furthermore , result expect positive impact advance neurocritical care child , forthcoming development serum biomarker point care test biomarker panel accurately classify risk unfavorable outcome clinician researcher need stratify severity injury , monitor response therapy , ultimately assist rehabilitation recovery .</detailed_description>
