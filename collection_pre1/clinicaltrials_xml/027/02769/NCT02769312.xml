	<detailed_description>The purpose propose study evaluate feasibility theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TBS ) adjunct treatment Veterans PTSD . This project result development method need conduct adequately power , randomize control study TBS PTSD , ass relationship change symptom quality life . It also lay foundation subsequent rehabilitation study combine neuromodulation psychotherapy long term . TBS several advantage compare standard repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) , include ability deliver large number stimulation pulse short time period , stimulation pattern may specifically affect key brain region involve PTSD . The significance research development novel , non-invasive brain stimulation approach PTSD recovery . This project provide foundation development method need conduct adequately power , randomize control study TBS PTSD ultimately develop brain stimulation technique combine evidence-based psychotherapy , develop powerful , individualized rehabilitation option Veterans PTSD .</detailed_description>
