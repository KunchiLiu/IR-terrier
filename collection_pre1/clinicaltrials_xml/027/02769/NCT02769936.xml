	<brief_summary>Impairments plasticity work memory schizophrenia hypothesize reflect dysfunction N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor ( NMDAR ) . However , specific mechanism NMDAR involve work memory versus plasticity differ . Towards gain deeper understand NMDAR signal relates individual cognitive function healthy adult patient schizophrenia , investigator use single dose d-cycloserine ( DCS ) experimental probe examine effect enhance NMDAR signal plasticity versus work memory healthy adult individual schizophrenia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Cognitive impairment schizophrenia , deficit plasticity work memory , hypothesize reflect dysfunction N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor ( NMDAR ) . However , give divergent property NMDAR underlie role plasticity versus work memory various aspect NMDAR function abnormal schizophrenia , examine effect DCS healthy patient population crucial . Methods : The investigator use single dose partial NMDAR agonist , d-cycloserine ( DCS ) probe effect enhance NMDAR signal work memory plasticity . Working memory assess use spatial n-back task . Plasticity assess use two learning task , weather prediction task information integration task , EEG paradigm ass change visual evoke potential amplitude follow high frequency visual stimulation . Sixty-five healthy adult forty-five schizophrenia patient randomize receive 100 mg acute DCS ( healthy adult n = 32 ; schizophrenia n = 24 ) placebo ( healthy adult n = 33 ; schizophrenia n = 21 ) .</detailed_description>
