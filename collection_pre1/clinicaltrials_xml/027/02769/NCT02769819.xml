	<brief_title>Identification Morphological Characteristics Predict Difficult Endotracheal Intubation Using Flexible Fiberscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endotracheal intubation important act practice anesthesiology . Direct laryngoscopy commonly use technique accomplish task . Airway characteristic predict difficult intubation direct laryngoscopy well define . Physical finding , Mallampati classification measurement thyromental distance , mouth opening , neck extension validate help anticipate difficult situation direct laryngoscope . When direct laryngoscopy difficult , early conversion alternative technique reduces risk airway compromise associate morbidity . Many alternative intubation device available , part anesthesiologist 's task select alternative approach best suit patient 's specific feature . Despite use elective unexpectedly difficult intubation , predictive criterion successful airway management flexible fiberscope develop . The purpose study identify patient morphometric morphological characteristic , , could predict difficult intubation use flexible fiberscope perioperative tracheal intubation elective surgical population .</detailed_description>
