	<brief_title>A Study Capmatinib ( INC280 ) NSCLC Patients With MET Exon 14 Alterations Who Have Received Prior MET Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Capmatinib treatment disease . In research study , investigator use study drug call Capmatinib . Capmatinib specific blocker cMET protein . This protein act trigger start series event cell know C-Met pathway . Patients MET exon 14 skip activation MET pathway . By block MET , Capmatinib may slow stop growth and/or survival cancer cell . Capmatinib yet FDA approve treatment people type cancer . It known capmatinib effective people previously drug block cMET pathway . This study help u understand capmatinib work body capmatinib cancer . Any potential harmful effect capmatinib also study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written informed consent must obtain prior screen procedure . Age ≥ 18 year Histologically cytologically confirm nonsmall cell lung cancer , advance , recurrent , metastatic MET exon 14 skip alteration molecular testing ( local testing accepted eligibility ; patient confirmation NGSrearrangement assay MGH result necessary eligibility ; local molecular pathology result suffice ) . This test archival fresh sample . Must receive prior platinum contain chemotherapy advanced/metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer , refuse ineligible therapy . Prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant platinum contain chemotherapy count receive prior platinum , provide disease recur within 6 month completion neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy . EGFR ALK status must know patient adenocarcinoma histology . Patients activate EGFR mutation ALK translocation exclude study , unless disease progress available , approved therapy target alteration . At least one measurable lesion define RECIST 1.1 . A previously irradiate site lesion may count target lesion clear sign progression since irradiation . Must receive prior MET inhibitor immediately precede therapy . There limit number line prior therapy long prior MET inhibitor recent therapy . Patients must recover toxicity relate prior anticancer therapy grade ≤ 1 ( CTCAE v 4.03 ) . Patients grade alopecia allow enter study . Patients must adequate organ function include follow laboratory value screen visit : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L without growth factor support Platelets ≥ 75 x 109/L Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) &gt; 9 g/dL Calculated creatinine clearance ( use CockcroftGault formula ) &gt; 45 mL/min Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN , except patient Gilbert 's syndrome , may include total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) ≤ 3 x ULN , except patient liver metastasis , include AST ≤ 5 x ULN Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 3 x ULN , except patient liver metastasis , include ALT ≤ 5 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) ≤ 5.0 x ULN Asymptomatic serum amylase ≤ grade 2 . Patients grade 1 grade 2 serum amylase begin study must confirm sign and/or symptom suggest pancreatitis pancreatic injury ( e.g. , elevated Pamylase , abnormal imaging finding pancreas , etc . ) Serum lipase ≤ ULN Patients must follow laboratory value within laboratory normal limit correct within normal limit supplement screen : Potassium Magnesium Phosphorus Total calcium ( correct serum albumin ) ECOG performance status ( PS ) 0 1 Willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan laboratory test . Patients know hypersensitivity excipients INC280 ( crospovidone , mannitol , microcrystalline cellulose , povidone , sodium lauryl sulfate , magnesium stearate , colloidal silicon dioxide , various coat premix ) . Patients symptomatic central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases neurologically unstable require increase dos steroid within 2 week prior study entry manage CNS symptom Presence history carcinomatous meningitis Presence history malignant disease disease treat current protocol diagnose and/or require therapy within past 3 year . Exceptions exclusion include follow : completely resect basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , indolent malignancy currently require treatment , completely resect carcinoma situ type Clinically significant , uncontrolled heart disease . Unstable angina within 6 month prior screen Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior screen History document congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association functional classification IIIIV ) Uncontrolled hypertension define Systolic Blood Pressure ( SBP ) ≥ 160 mm Hg and/or Diastolic Blood Pressure ( DBP ) ≥ 100 mm Hg , without antihypertensive medication . Initiation adjustment antihypertensive medication ( ) allow prior screen Ventricular arrhythmia Supraventricular nodal arrhythmia control medication Other cardiac arrhythmia control medication QTcF &gt; 480 msec Thoracic radiotherapy lung field ≤ 4 week prior start INC280 patient recover radiotherapyrelated toxicity . For anatomic site ( include radiotherapy thoracic vertebra rib ) , radiotherapy ≤ 2 week prior start INC280 patient recover radiotherapyrelated toxicity . Palliative radiotherapy bone lesion ≤ 2 week prior start INC280 allow Major surgery ( e.g. , intrathoracic , intraabdominal intrapelvic ) within 4 week prior ( 2 week resection brain metastasis ) start INC280 recover side effect procedure . Videoassisted thoracic surgery ( VATS ) mediastinoscopy count major surgery patient enrol study ≥ 1 week procedure Patients receive treatment medication meet one follow criterion discontinue least 1 week prior start treatment INC280 duration study : Strong moderate inhibitor CYP3A4 Strong inducer CYP3A4 Proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) Impairment GI function GI disease may significantly alter absorption INC280 ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome ) Unable unwilling swallow tablet per dose schedule Patients receive unstable increase dos corticosteroid . If patient corticosteroids endocrine deficiency tumorassociated symptom CNS relate , dose must stabilize ( decrease ) least 5 day first dose INC280 Patients receive treatment enzymeinducing anticonvulsant discontinue least 1 week first dose INC280 , duration study . Patients nonenzymeinducing anticonvulsant eligible Previous anticancer investigational agent within 4 week ≤ 5 x halflife agent ( whichever longer ) first dose INC280 . If previous treatment monoclonal antibody , treatment must discontinue least 4 week first dose INC280 Other severe , acute , chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality opinion investigator may increase risk associate study participation , may interfere interpretation study result Any condition would , Investigator 's judgment , contraindicate patient 's participation clinical study due safety concern compliance clinical study procedure , e.g. , infection/inflammation , intestinal obstruction , unable swallow medication , social/ psychological issue , etc . Pregnant nursing woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , unless use highly effective method contraception dose 7 day stop treatment . Highly effective contraception method include : Total abstinence ( line prefer usual lifestyle subject . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception Female sterilization ( surgical bilateral oophorectomy without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week take study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment Male sterilization ( least 6 month prior screen ) . For female subject study vasectomized male partner sole partner subject Combination two follow ( a+b a+c , b+c ) : Use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception form hormonal contraception comparable efficacy ( failure rate ≤ 1 % ) , example hormone vaginal ring transdermal hormone contraception Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) Barrier method contraception : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository In case use oral contraception woman stable pill minimum 3 month take study treatment . Women consider postmenopausal child bear potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g. , age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week ago . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider child bear potential Sexually active male unless use condom intercourse take drug 7 day stop treatment father child period . A condom require use also vasectomize men order prevent delivery drug via seminal fluid</criteria>
