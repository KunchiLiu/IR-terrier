	<brief_summary>Breast cancer survivor , diagnosis end life , go many transition . One major transition significant decrease physical activity immediately diagnosis . Despite known benefit physical activity—speeding recovery time reduce cancer recurrence risk—only 1 3 survivor meet physical activity recommendation 150 minute moderate-intensity activity per week . Physical activity intervention show effectiveness help breast cancer survivor increase physical activity treatment , limited evidence-based physical activity intervention incorporate clinic community . To address limitation , investigator partner UTMB breast cancer support group conduct 12-week physical activity intervention , Pink Warrior . The goal study compare intervention us active game versus intervention us pedometer encourage physical activity walk within breast cancer survivor active cancer treatment . The study include breast cancer survivor age 18 - 70 currently get less 150 minute plan physical activity per week receive breast cancer diagnosis within 0 6 month . Participants randomize participate support group use active video game-based physical activity intervention ( Wii Xbox active game ) participate exist UTMB breast cancer support group pedometer ( Digi-Walker CW-700/701 ) . The investigator hypothesize engage active video gaming , breast cancer survivor motivate initiate maintain physical activity treatment . This ultimately increase functional capacity prevent functional disability breast cancer survivor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Increasing maintain physical activity among female breast cancer ( BC ) survivor treatment remain unresolved problem BC survivorship care . BC survivor , diagnosis end life , go many transition . One major transition significant decline physical activity immediately diagnosis . Despite known benefit physical activity—speeding recovery time reduce cancer recurrence risk—less 30 % survivor meet physical activity recommendation . Physical activity intervention show effectiveness help BC survivor increase activity treatment , limited evidence-based activity intervention disseminate clinic community . To address limitation , partner UTMB breast cancer support group conduct 12-week physical activity intervention , Pink Warrior , investigate feasibility implement active video game-based physical activity intervention among BC survivor undergo treatment within support group set . Participants ( N = 60 ) randomize participate support group use active video game-based physical activity intervention participate exist UTMB breast cancer support group pedometer . Our specific aim : Aim 1 : Evaluate feasibility acceptability active video game-based physical activity intervention among BC survivor undergo treatment within support group set . Measures feasibility include weekly attendance record , number complete home-based worksheet , number participant complete program activity , technological issue , adverse event . Aim 2 : Compare support group use active video game-based physical activity intervention exist UTMB breast cancer support group pedometer . Primary outcome change physical activity . Secondary outcome change physical function , dietary pattern , quality life .</detailed_description>
