	<criteria>The study population Step 1 must meet following eligibility criterion : Stage 1 , 2 3 invasive breast cancer triple negative . Triple negative breast cancer define ER 0 % , PR 0 % HER2 0 1+ FISH amplify IHC 2+ . AR test may perform patient undergo adjuvant therapy ( i.e. , surgery , chemotherapy , radiation ) . Willing able provide inform consent . Woman least 18 year age . Patient candidate treatment early stage breast cancer . The study population Step 2 meet eligibility criterion : Stage 1 , 2 3 invasive breast cancer triple negative . Triple negative breast cancer define ER 0 % , PR 0 % HER2 0 1+ FISH amplify IHC 2+ . AR ( + ) , define ≥1 % nuclear staining IHC testing . The assessment AR expression may perform time past limited participation Step 1 . Any neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy regimen permit . Prior chemotherapy treatment breast cancer require . At least 4 week end surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy resolution toxicity Grade 1 less , exclude alopecia . Patients eligible participate within 6 month completion therapy breast cancer . This include prior radiation therapy need . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Willing able provide inform consent .
