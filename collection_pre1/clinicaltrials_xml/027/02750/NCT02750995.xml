	<brief_title>Peptide Vaccination Combination With Azacitidine Patients With MDS AML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Patients high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , offer curative treatment , poor prognosis median survival 11.5 month . There currently one register drug show prolong survival patient group ; hypomethylating agent azacitidine ( also know 5-azacytidine VidazaÂ® ) . The treatment curative , increase median survival approximately two year . The dominant cause death progressive disease , huge need new treatment option . In study combine experimental immunotherapy peptide vaccination standard therapy azacitidine treatment patient high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia . Our project expect expand knowledge regard combination immunotherapy conventional treatment essential development treatment modality . MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROME ( MDS ) Accumulation genetic epigenetic change hematopoietic stem cell consider background development MDS . In early stage disease , increase apoptosis , disease progress high-risk MDS AML accumulation chromosomal breakage , point mutation promoter hypermethylation tumor suppressor gene , result aggressive proliferative disease . The clinical symptom anemia , repeat infection bleed episode associate dysfunctional bone marrow . Currently , curative treatment option MDS allogeneic bone marrow transplantation . This high-risk treatment , feasible young patient suitable donor . In 2009 , Phase III study ( AZA 001 ) publish , show patient high-risk MDS AML &lt; 30 % blast treat hypomethylating drug azacitidine superior overall survival . AZACITIDINE The effect azacitidine immediate patient , therefore necessary proceed minimum 5-6 cycle determine whether patient response treatment . At present , azacitidine standard care patient high-risk MDS AML &lt; 30 % blast , offer curative treatment . Unfortunately , patient respond treatment later relapse die disease . The mechanism behind clinical efficacy azacitidine fully elucidate may multiparametric . The hypomethylation result re-expression tumor suppressor gene may serve possible mechanism growth arrest . In addition , up-regulation cancer testis antigen ( CTA ) observe treatment , could lead increase immune recognition tumor cell , hence immune-mediated tumor cell kill . For participant trial , azacitidine standard therapy administer accord standard dosing regimen , participant evaluate treatment response accord standard criterion . TUMOR ASSOCIATED ANTIGENS The principle behind cancer vaccination base immune system 's ability discriminate normal malignant cell . The immune system recognize altered pattern peptide expression surface malignant cell . The altered pattern may involve expression qualitatively alter cell protein , simple overexpression normally occur protein , de novo expression proteins/glycoproteins normally express tissue . This category immune-recognized protein know tumor associate antigens . As protein degrade cell , peptide present surface cell complex tissue type molecule ( HLA molecule ) . T-cells may recognize peptide-HLA complex , via T-cell receptor , potentially result tumor-cell killing , sufficient priming take place . For present study , group cancer testis antigen ( CTA 's ) special interest , since expression know regulated methylation , therefore affect hypo-methylating treatment azacitidine . CTA 's know immunogenic express immunoprivileged site , thus reach immune response , cancer cell , make ideal target therapeutic cancer vaccination . VACCINE DESIGN We choose specifically three CTA 's abundant re-expression show following azacitidine treatment , include NY-ESO-1 , MAGE-A3 PRAME . WT-1 additionally include protein proven important antigen hematological malignancy likewise upregulated response azacitidine treatment . The peptide choose use together particular combination , separately use therapeutic vaccination well study . Both small peptide sequence full length protein utilized . The use synthetic long peptides induction T-cell responses show superior effect contrast minimal peptide sequence mice human , furthermore synthetic long peptide show efficiently process present CD4 CD8 T-cells immune system . Also , long-peptides advantage enable presentation several different T-cell epitope dependent patient ' HLA type . Thus , choice long peptides minimize impact patient HLA type , therefore present study allow inclusion participant without prior selection base HLA expression . The peptide choose 25 29 amino acid mixed suspension Montanide ISA-51 ; commonly use water oil base vaccine adjuvant , involve 150 registered trial Clinicaltrail.gov . TRIAL DESIGN Patients high-risk MDS AML &lt; 30 % blast today offer treatment azacitidine , 100 mg/m2 5 day every 4th week . In proposed vaccination protocol , choose follow regimen , addition offer vaccination peptide derive cancer testis antigen . Patients include completion 6 course azacitidine treatment evaluation . If patient show response treatment azacitidine marrow hypoplastic , azacitidine treatment combine peptide vaccination boost immune reactivity select tumor antigen . Patients vaccinate set 3 vaccination , vaccination 1st day azacitidine course , give every 4th week . If treatment delay 3 week patient exclude protocol . Patients evaluate clinical response 6 course azacitidine treatment combine vaccination . Patients progress , continue azacitidine treatment accord standard schedule , vaccination give every 6th month . Vaccination continue 2 year initiation vaccination disease progression . STUDY METHOD PREPARATION OF THE PEPTIDE VACCINE The peptide vaccine prepared GMP approve laboratory condition ( approve Danish Medicines Agency ) , assure quality sterile medicinal product . Production take place room JM702 , Herlev Hospital approval number 24223 . Below brief description various procedure . The final vaccine product hold label provide information vaccine content project number give department . Peptides The vaccination target four long peptide sequence proteins : NY-ESO-1 ( 119-143 , 25aa ) : PGVLLKEFTVSGNILTIRLTAADHR ; PRAME ( 423-447 , 25aa ) : LQSLLQHLIGLSNLTHVLYPVPLES ; MAGE-A3 ( 255-279 , 25aa ) : YLEYRQVPGSDPACYEFLWGPRALV ; WT1 ( 231-259 , 29aa ) : SQLECMTWNQMNLGATLKGVAAGSSSSVK . The peptide synthesize &gt; 97 % purity external provider , Pepscan Presto , The Netherlands . Prior use , dissolve DMSO , mixed , sterile filter 0.22 micron filter . Endotoxin bacterial cultivation test carry preparation . Sterility test release peptides vaccination treatment carry hematological laboratory ( location 54P4 ) . Adjuvant : Montanide ISA 51 Montanide ISA 51 purchase Seppic Inc. , France , sterile form . We use 0.5 ml Montanide per vaccine . Preparation vaccine The vaccine generate mix peptide-preparation adjuvant , on-side , prior injection . Microbiological control Before use , peptide mix subject endotoxin test microbiological test execute Department Microbiology , Herlev Hospital . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN This open-label Phase I study design evaluate safety combination therapy azacitidine peptide-vaccination patient MDS AML . We expect enroll participant within 24 month evaluate study 12 month thereafter . Participants continue azacitidine disease progression , vaccination 2 year , disease progression . Participants may stop treatment time upon request , withdrawn treatment follow disease progression severe toxicity treatment . The inclusion period expect begin April 2016 finalize April 2018 . Thereafter follow-up period maximum 2 year follow . Last participant last protocolled visit date late , April 2020 . Patients MDS AML , receive treatment azacitidine , recruit Department Hematology Herlev Hospital . Since patient follow outpatient setting , around six month prior inclusion receive azacitidine treatment , possible candidate identify early properly inform consent form need sign . ETHICAL ASPECTS Participation voluntary precede write informed consent . Treatment terminate case unacceptable side effect , upon patient 's request time . If patient interested participation trial , treatment give accord department 's usual guideline . The study therefore consider ethically sound . The study follow guideline Helsinki Agreement responsible physician obtain permit Scientific Ethical Committee , Danish Health Medicines Agency Danish Data Protection Agency conduct study .</detailed_description>
