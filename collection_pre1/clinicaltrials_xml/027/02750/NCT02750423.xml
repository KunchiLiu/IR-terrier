	<brief_summary>Investigators seek learn well different cool temperature along different blood flow pathway brain reduce risk injury brain participant plan undergo elective aortic arch hemiarch surgery . Participants randomize receive cerebral protection strategy either : deep hypothermic circulatory arrest retrograde cerebral perfusion ( DHCA+RCP ) moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest unilateral selective antegrade cerebral perfusion ( MHCA+uSACP ) . Evidence neurologic injury assess neurologic exam , neurocognitive test , MRI image brain measurement plasma S-100 level post operative follow ups .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate impact two commonly employ method cerebral protection upon mitigate neurologic injury participant plan undergo elective aortic arch hemiarch surgery . Participants recruit patient undergo ascend aortic hemiarch replacement use hypothermic circulatory arrest Emory University Hospital Emory Saint Joseph 's Hospital . Participants randomize receive cerebral protection strategy either : deep hypothermic circulatory arrest retrograde cerebral perfusion ( DHCA+RCP ) moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest unilateral selective antegrade cerebral perfusion ( MHCA+uSACP ) . Evidence neurologic injury assess neurologic exam , neurocognitive test , MRI image brain measurement plasma S-100 level post operative follow . Follow visit conduct Days 1 , 3 , 7 , 180 post operation .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients Emory University Hospital Emory Saint Joseph 's Hospital planning undergo : Elective surgical replacement ascend aorta proximal ( `` hemiarch '' ) use hypothermic circulatory arrest Concomitant cardiac procedure ( e.g valve replacement , coronary artery bypass , etc . ) addition ascend aortic hemiarch replacement Any follow cannulation cerebral protection strategy : 1 . Right axillary artery cannulation , deep hypothermic circulatory arrest , retrograde cerebral perfusion 2 . Right axillary artery cannulation , moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest , unilateral selective antegrade cerebral perfusion Undergoing total arch replacement Undergoing hemiarch replacement without use hypothermic circulatory arrest Undergoing hemiarch replacement use hypothermic circulatory arrest method cerebral protection list Eligibility Criteria .
