	<detailed_description>In last year , new clinical entity emerge include patient consider suffer problem cause wheat and/or gluten ingestion , even though celiac disease ( CD ) wheat allergy . This clinical condition name non-celiac gluten sensitivity ( NCGS ) , although recent article , investigator suggest term `` non-celiac wheat sensitivity '' ( NCWS ) , know date component wheat actually cause symptom . Other area doubt NCWS regard pathogenesis , paper report intestinal immunologic activation , others link NCWS dietary short chain carbohydrate ( fermentable oligo-di-monosaccharides polyols , FODMAPs ) load . The investigator recently demonstrate high proportion patient NCWS develop autoimmune disorder , antinuclear antibody ( ANA ) positive , show DQ2/DQ8 haplotype compare patient irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , support immunologic involvement NCWS . Furthermore , paper report also high frequency , range 22 % 35 % , coexistent atopic disease NCWS patient , investigator suggest percentage NCWS patient could really suffer non-IgE-mediated wheat allergy . Nickel fourth use metal frequent cause contact allergy industrialized world . As natural element earth 's crust small amount find water , soil , natural food , especially plant one . Nickel allergy affect skin also result systemic manifestation . Systemic nickel allergy syndrome cutaneous ( urticaria/angioedema , flare , itch ) , and/or gastrointestinal ( meteorism , colic , diarrhoea ) sign symptom . Volta et al . report 15 % NCWS patient suffer allergy nickel , characterize subgroup patient , neither pose NCWS diagnosis mean double-blind placebo control challenge ( DBPCC ) , recommend . In study , investigator evaluate 1 ) frequency Nickel allergy Systemic Nickel allergy syndrome NCWS patient , 2 ) clinical , serological , histological characteristic NCWS patient contact dermatitis Nickel positive comparison NCWS patient without contact dermatitis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient meet recently propose criterion : negative serum antitissue transglutaminase antiendomysium ( EmA ) IgA IgG antibody ; absence intestinal villous atrophy ; IgEmediated immunoallergy test negative wheat ( skin prick test and/or serum specific IgE detection ) . Adjunctive criterion adopt patient : resolution gastrointestinal symptom standard elimination diet , without wheat , cow 's milk , egg , tomato , chocolate , food ( ) causing selfreported symptom ; symptom reappearance doubleblind placebocontrolled ( DBPC ) wheat challenge , perform describe previously . As previous study , DBPC cow 's milk protein challenge `` open '' food challenge also perform . Exclusion criterion : age &lt; 18 year ; positive EmA culture medium duodenal biopsy , even villi crypt ratio duodenal mucosa normal ; selfexclusion wheat diet refusal reintroduce enter study ; organic cutaneous and/or gastrointestinal disease ; concomitant treatment steroid and/or antihistamine . Allergic contact dermatitis diagnose patient show local eczematous lesion skin close contact nickelcontaining object . Suspected systemic nickel allergy syndrome ( SNAS ) , define reaction characterize diffuse eczematous lesion ( systemic contact dermatitis ) also extracutaneous sign symptom , mainly gastrointestinal , ingestion nickelrich food ( i.e . tomato , cocoa , bean , mushroom , vegetable , wheat flour , etc ) . In case , diagnosis confirm mean epicutaneous patch test provoke delayed lesion .</criteria>
