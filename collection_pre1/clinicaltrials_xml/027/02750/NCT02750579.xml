	<brief_summary>Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) cornerstone care intermediate high-risk non ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome ( NSTE ACS ) . Revascularization reduce rate cardiovascular death recurrent myocardial infarction clinical setting . The recommendation regard time intervention clinical setting derive old trial weak level evidence . In fact , conclusive randomize trial contemporary era provide guidance optimal timing intervention . In addition , optimal time critical intervention study since development new P2Y12-ADP receptor antagonist controversy surround use pretreatment P2Y12-ADP receptor antagonist intervention . Early intervention intermediate high-risk non ST-elevation ACS well validate date . In addition , recent change use pretreatment P2Y12-ADP receptor antagonist may impact potential benefit early intervention . Based evidence , hypothesize current protocol care without pretreatment P2Y12-ADP receptor antagonist , early PCI ( &lt; 2 hour ) would superior delay ( 12 72 hour ) PCI set intermediate high-risk non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome prevent cardiovascular death ischemic recurrence .</brief_summary>
