The investigator conduct Randomized Control Trial ( RCT ) evaluate agent technology , compare usual care ( UC ) versus usual care plus agent ( UC+ECA ) patient 21 old , life expectancy &lt; 1 year , outpatient clinic Boston Medical Center ( BMC ) . Each subject enrol along caregiver surrogate subject . In addition baseline data collection , monthly phone survey six month ; intervention subject use system six-month period time . In addition , investigator conduct randomize trial within intervention group compare subject get function 1-4 ( ) versus subject get augment intervention six function .

	<detailed_description>Pilot Study The pilot study determine usability ECA tablet system . Healthy volunteer recruit Northeastern University , system develop . Subjects spend approximately 60 minute tablet system provide usability feedback . Twelve healthy patient volunteer recruit review system well provide feedback relative interview burden ( interview long , invasive , etc ) . No identifiable data collect pilot study subject . Main Study The study consist adult advance illness ( health care provider endorse existence potentially life-limiting condition endorse `` would surprise patient die within 12 month '' ) randomize intervention usual care control group . Each person advance illness enrol along caregiver ( i.e. , family , friend ) serve surrogate subject . The caregiver consent baseline interview point final , 6-month study visit . In addition , , point enrollment study , patient-subject becomes unable , decisionally impaired , answer interview question , caregiver ask answer behalf subject . The patient find decisionally impaired 3 way : 1. patient declares unable answer question appropriately 2. patient unable pas brief cognitive assessment administer begin telephone follow-up ( per Brief Screen Cognitive Impairment ) 3. patient physically unable answer question phone ( due , example , serious health decline death ) Baseline data collect enrollment randomization . Baseline data include : 1. sociodemographic data 2 . Quality life measure European Organisation Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality Life Questionnaire-Palliative Care 3 . Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) Mental Health 4 . Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) Social Health 5 . Patient Activation Measure ( PAM ) 6 . Patient Medication Adherence Questionnaire ( PMAQ ) 7 . Spiritual Needs Assessment Patients ( SNAP ) 8 . Community Healthy Activity Model Program Seniors ( CHAMPS ) 9. survey Advance Care Planning ( ACP ) communication preference 10 . BSCI ( This cognitive assessment non-exclusionary , , patient score `` 0 '' word recall , designate caregiver/surrogate ask act research proxy answer question patient-subject . ) The investigator also interview surrogate subject baseline regard level caregiver stress : 1. CarerQol-7D 2. caregiver 's level happiness ( CarerQol-VAS ) 3. self-rated burden ( SRB ) care give After initial visit , study staff administer 5 monthly phone survey ( month 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) , EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL collect . At begin data collection point study staff administer Brief Survey Cognitive Impairment ( BSCI ) determine patient cognitively able answer question , also inquire unplanned health care utilization ( i.e. , urgent care , emergency room , hospital observation visit , hospital admission ) . At final , 6-month visit , patient-subject interview person , surrogate , full list instrument administer . In addition , study staff prepare summary data report patient 's clinical team . The report include obtain information Palliative Care service . The research staff ask subject clinician would like receive information . Subjects randomized intervention give mini-tablet computer configure purpose study . A research assistant set tablet , enroll subject study database , train subject use system . Subjects exist WiFi home provide cellular-based router . In case , study staff arrange WiFi service plan , install router home , confirm connectivity . The investigator estimate many instance , clinician endorses would surprise patient die within 12 month , would first time solidify prognostic outlook mind patient . Stimulating clinician consider patient 's life-expectancy form intervention , may instigate communication prognosis patient , re-evaluation treatment course , assessment goal care , improve level attention symptom . The investigator conduct informational session study provide material palliative care service outpatient clinical environment subject enrol . Information provide clinician contact Palliative Care service obtain consultation . Clinicians encourage call assistance palliative care need intervention subject , usual care subject , non-subjects . The measure collect baseline also collect final 6-month interview . At end study participation investigator also prepare summary data report patient 's clinical team . The report include information obtain consultation Palliative Care service . The research nurse ask subject clinician would like receive information .</detailed_description>
