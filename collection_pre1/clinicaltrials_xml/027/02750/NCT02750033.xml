	<brief_summary>The research team develop intraoperative handheld device assess surgical margin Mohs surgery . The device technology base multimodal optical spectroscopy ( MMS ) , combine three optical spectroscopy technique one device . The researcher first acquire proof concept MMS measurement within Mohs surgery suite immediately surgical excision prior histological processing . MMS measurement acquire directly patient NMSC excision site . The final outcome study result sensitivity specificity MMS compare histopathology Mohs surgery . These result allow estimation potential benefit intraoperative margin assessment technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraoperative Margin Assessment During Mohs Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acquire intraoperative MMS measurement vivo . After assess approach excise tissue , MMS measurement aquired directly patient NMSC excision site . MMS data acquire patient treat NMSC Austin Dermatologic Surgery Center , surgical site dermatology practice Seton/University Texas Physicians group . Similar measurement freshly excise tissue , MMS data acquire grid pattern excision site . The site blot gauze remove residual blood prior measurement , continuously blot need measurement take . The handheld probe MMS enable assessment wound periphery deeper layer tissue determine tumor remain . For initial pilot study , plan take measurement 10 patient ( 5 BCC , 5 SCC ) , along correspond normal tissue measurement . Retrospective analysis MMS sensitivity specificity . The MMS technique information rich modality provide morphological functional parameter interrogate tissue could correlate known tumor pathology . However , extracted information require development sophisticated spectral analysis model would beyond scope current study . Therefore , purpose study , standard statistical technique use determine classification power MMS tumor margin detection . While approach fully elucidate underlie pathology responsible classification , type model show perform well base morphological approach . This approach previously employ classify skin cancer high diagnostic accuracy . The final outcome study result sensitivity specificity MMS compare histopathology Mohs surgery . These result allow estimation potential benefit intraoperative margin assessment technique . This type retrospective study provide proof concept would warrant development prospective study MMS approach .</detailed_description>
