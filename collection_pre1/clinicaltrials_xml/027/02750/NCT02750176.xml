	<brief_summary>A single arm design use assess feasibility preliminary efficacy closed-chain rehabilitation protocol patient full thickness rotator cuff tear shoulder . Full thickness rotator cuff tear document use MRI ultrasound image . 30 participant recruit study . The rehabilitation protocol include two stage : stage 1 , physical therapy , stage 2 , gym program . Stage I include total number session 12 24 . The number session include stage 2 , depend total number session complete stage 1 . The total duration stage 5 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Closed-chain exercise use extensively rehabilitation approach treat diverse range musculoskeletal diagnosis . The closed-chain approach theoretically facilitate co-contraction improve joint mobility , stability motor control , well decrease potential compression RC tendon subacromial space . The closed-chain exercise perform hand contact floor/table , shoulder joint move gravity provide resistance . This approach may prevent tear progression improve joint mechanic , shoulder pain , function . STAGE 1 - Physical therapy Participants provide closed-chain exercise physical therapy treatment license physical therapist . The length session 1 hour . Participants attend 2 session per week , minimum 12 session . The maximum number session complete Stage I protocol 24 . Each physical therapy session consist closed-chain strengthening , along stretch aerobic exercise . During closed-chain strengthen portion , participant ask perform 6 exercise focus shoulder girdle . Closed-chain strengthening perform shoulder move fix hand . Resistance provide body weight gravity . To off-load progress amount body-weight resistance , elastic band use support body weight . The elastic band attached support frame use exercise . As patient improves , less elastic band support provide allow increase resistance via patient 's body weight . The criterion determine resistance high exercise difficult base 2 criterion : 1 . ) exercise complete , participant rate shoulder pain &gt; 2/10 increase compare baseline pain take start day 's treatment session , numeric pain rating scale , 2 . ) BORG scale &gt; 3 ( moderate difficulty ) inability participant maintain proper exercise form full range motion . If criterion meet physical therapist modify exercise subject perform similar movement pattern without pain . The goal participant perform 2 set 20 repetition , exercise . When participant able perform 24 repetition give load , 2 successive treatment session , resistance increase . The investigator recognize limited evidence regard effectiveness safety closed-chain exercise patient full-thickness rotator cuff tear . Therefore , investigator employ several step assure safety . At begin session , patient fill questionnaire ass adverse effect exercise ( severe joint pain ) . After exercise , participant rate shoulder pain level perceive difficulty exercise . This information use tailor intervention accord response intervention . Furthermore , allow monitor adverse outcome intervention . Participants perform aerobic exercise stationary bike , elliptical , treadmill . Aerobic exercise last 10 15 minute session . Intensity aerobic exercise adjust throughout stage I . The target exercise least 4 level ( somewhat hard ) BORG scale . STAGE 2 - Gym program Participants enrol gym program follow discharge Stage 1 . The Gym Program provide health care professional train delivery exercise . Each session 1 hour . Participants attend 2 session per week , 8- 12 week depend discharged Stage I . Each session consist closed-chain strengthening , stretch , aerobic exercise . During closed-chain strengthen portion , participant execute six-strengthening exercise stage I . The next phase involve progress moderate resistance load allow participant complete 2 set 8 12 repetition give exercise . When participant able perform 12 repetition give load , course 2 successive training session , resistance incrementally increase . The maximum resistance body weight ( support band ) . Participants perform aerobic exercise alternate session stationary bike , elliptical , treadmill . Aerobic exercise last 15 20 minute session . Intensity aerobic exercise adjust throughout stage II . The target exercise least 4 level ( somewhat hard ) BORG scale .</detailed_description>
