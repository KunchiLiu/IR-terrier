	<brief_summary>This pilot study determine overall survival rate toxicity obinutuzumab give GDP chemotherapy relapse refractory CD20+ aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Patients CD20+ progress R-CHOP therapy enrol study . About 30 patient plan enrolled Princess Margaret Cancer Centre . If enrollment slow additional site may include . Patients receive Obinutuzumab +GDP 3 cycle intravenously . CT scan use evaluate response rate cycle 2 PET-CT use cycle 3 . Responders ( complete metabolic response , partial metabolic response ) proceed autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT ) . Patients progress three cycle less protocol treatment discontinue , subsequent treatment investigator discretion . Patients follow 24 month transplant do last chemo . Mandatory tissue submission optional tissue blood submission require correlative component study .</brief_summary>
