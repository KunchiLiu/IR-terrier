	<brief_summary>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( allo-HCT ) potentially curative therapy patient hematologic malignancy include acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) ; however , human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -matched donor availability continue major hurdle . Historically , HLA haploidentical donor hematopoietic cell transplantation ( haplo-HCT ) associate high incidence graft rejection excessive non-relapse mortality ( NRM ) , recent advance utilize post-transplant cyclophosphamide ( PT-Cy ) revolutionize haplo-HCT outcome comparable allo-HCT use traditional HLA match related unrelated donor . However , graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) continue problem associate significant morbidity mortality allo-HCT patient include receive haplo-HCT PT-Cy platform . The aim early phase study investigate safety overall efficacy azacitidine reduce incidence severity GvHD add PT-Cy base haplo-HCT platform patient AML , ALL , advance MDS .</brief_summary>
