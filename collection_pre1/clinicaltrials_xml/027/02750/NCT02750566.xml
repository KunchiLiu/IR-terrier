	<brief_title>Comparing Effect Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine ( OMM ) Versus Counseling Treatment Concussion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : The purpose study investigate effectiveness osteopathic manipulative treatment ( OMT ) improve concussion-related symptom . Previous study case report find positive effect OMT resolve concussion-like symptom vertigo , imbalance , tinnitus . It hypothesize OMT improves proprioceptive input cervical spine joint sensory input internal auditory meatus . The investigator propose investigate relationship order quantify effect OMT SMART Balance Master return play/work time . As pilot study , investigator intend determine correlation exist OMT return work/play SMART Balance Master score . Specifically , investigator three main aim study : Specific Aim # 1 : OMT show statistically significant improvement balance measure SMART Balance Master score pre- post-OMT Specific Aim # 2 : OMT decrease concussion symptom measure survey Specific Aim # 3 : OMT decrease return play/work time concuss subject compare standard . Background/Rationale : Concussion mild traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) challenge injury physician manage . It undetectable traditional imaging technique , limited treatment option . A concussion result biomechanical force direct towards head precedes contributes neurologic dysfunction , include impairment level consciousness . However , loss consciousness requirement diagnosis . The CDC estimate annual burden concussion United States roughly 1.4-3.8 million . Over past decade , CDC also report 70 % increase TBI emergency department visit , well increase TBI-related hospitalization . Other study determine prevalence individual chronic concussion problem US 5.3 million . Importantly , figure consider underestimate patient milder injury often seek treatment . The mechanism concussion involve primary secondary phase tissue injury . A primary injury immediate irreversible , result acceleration/deceleration mechanical damage . Secondary injury result non-mechanical damage derive neuronal cell membrane disruption axonal stretch . The membrane defect result secondary injury lead ionic influx accumulation toxic substance glutamate within nervous system . Individuals mild concussion recover within day ; however , 15 % patient mild concussion suffer long-term complication largely due secondary phase injury . Recent literature study role restrict cerebral blood flow inflammation perpetuate symptom concussion . Meier et al . discover inverse relationship cerebral blood flow dorsal midinsular cortex time return play . Other study investigate role inflammation , production reactive oxygen specie , contribute initial injury also potentiate pathological course . These study highlight potential mechanism could target decrease symptom improve outcome . Treatment mild concussion past limited bed rest . Previous study note bed rest follow concussion improve recovery time , continue long , negatively impact recovery . Some pilot project report promising finding decrease 30-day mortality progesterone . Through meta-analysis non-surgical intervention follow mild TBI , Nygren-de Boussard et al . find poor randomize controlled trial comparison group indicate intervention provide therapeutic benefit . Furthermore , evidence support individualize approach treat post-concussive symptom . Alternative complementary treatment encompass variety individual approach different patient include herbal supplement , homeopathy , hyperbaric oxygen , arts recreational therapy , meditation practice , Tai Chi Chuan . Empirical literature alternative treatment mild concussion sparse , many study either insufficiently power poorly control . The widespread use popularity treatment option potential help treat concussion demand scientific investigation . Osteopathic manipulative treatment ( OMT ) define Glossary Osteopathic Terminology `` therapeutic application manually guide force osteopathic physician improve physiologic function and/or support homeostasis alter somatic dysfunction . '' Somatic dysfunction , restriction skeletal myofascial structure , disrupt normal function vascular , lymphatic neural component related pas structure . By treat somatic dysfunction , OMT aim remove musculoskeletal ( MSK ) restriction allow increase blood flow lymphatic drainage decrease nerve impingement . Somatic dysfunction cranium spine contribute patient 's concussion symptom include dizziness tinnitus . Treatment somatic dysfunction OMT , target structure involve concussion-related symptom , may another treatment option offer patient . Evidence support use SMART Balance Master validate tool measure balance . Fraix et al . use SMART Balance Master NeuroCom® quantify beneficial effect OMT improve patient ' balance dizziness . The SMART Balance Master® use quantify change balance OMT . The Sensory Organization Test ( SOT ) one assessment tool measure three different aspect balance posture : somatosensory , visual , vestibular . The complete protocol SOT find NeuroCom® website . The ImPACT test widely use tool help detect assess severity concussion athlete . This computerized test administer athlete routinely establish baseline memory cognitive function , administer suspicion concussion order evaluate difference cognitive function . The test widely use show effect adjunct test evaluation concussion part comprehensive medical diagnosis involve test method . The SCAT-3 ( sport concussion assessment tool - 3rd edition ) improve version widely use aid physician evaluate concussion severity progress . The test combination patient-reported symptom evaluation well objective cognitive physical exam . The King-Devick Test objectively measure visual track saccadic eye movement ( rapid movement eye fixation point ) . The test originally develop 1976 eye care specialist help evaluate reading disability relate oculomotor movement . Since 2011 , test use rapid sideline screen tool concussion variety sport , base finding concussion associate many neuro-ophthalmologic sign . Many study show King-Devick Test valid aid detect evaluate concussion . It tool , investigator aim measure effect OMT post-concussion symptom .</detailed_description>
