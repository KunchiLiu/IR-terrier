	<brief_summary>Researchers look good way understand treat pancreatic cancer . The purpose study see useful look change characteristic gene ( molecule contain instruction development function cell ) gene within tumour . These characteristic may useful choose treatment patient future . Changes ( mutation ) gene show important characteristic cancer . Looking difference gene patient advance pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma compare information response initial chemotherapy treatment may help learn treatment may better certain patient initial treatment .</brief_summary>
