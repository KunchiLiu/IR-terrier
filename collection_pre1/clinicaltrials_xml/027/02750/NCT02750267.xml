	<brief_title>Closed-Loop Control Young Children 5-8 Years Old Using DiAs Platform</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Young child Type 1 Diabetes ( T1D ) age range 5-8 year old population clear need unique challenge regard application artificial pancreas ( AP ) technology . Young child likely benefit AP system , current deficit glycemic control include significant hypoglycemia sub-optimal HbA1c level ; however , undeveloped ability control interact AP system , pose potential safety issue . During hour child away parent school elsewhere , lack sophistication operate currently-available tool AP system -- may induce harm allow , cause parental resistance AP use . Commercially-available insulin pump mechanisms lock access child prevent inappropriate insulin-delivery . However , AP complex insulin pump , require detailed set information ( child could adversely alter ) provide alert impend low- high-blood glucose ( BG ) level ( one would n't want lock child use ) . These function run via platform smart phone—a device young child may already feel high degree familiarity thus likely attempt explore potentially change setting . It likely young child benefit system give access AP feature provide access feature parent . In sense , young child require device user-centered much family-centered . A redesign system provide appropriate access AP tools—in certain user obtain access certain functionalities—is direly need child age range benefit improvement blood glucose ( BG ) control AP offer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis type 1 diabetes , The diagnosis type 1 diabetes base investigator 's judgment C peptide level antibody determination require Daily insulin therapy ≥ 12 month Insulin pump therapy ≥ 3 month Age ≥5 ≤8 year old Avoidance acetaminophencontaining medication ( i.e . Tylenol ) wear continuous glucose monitor . Willingness wear continuous glucose sensor physiological monitor duration study The presence follow exclusion study : Diabetic ketoacidosis past month Hypoglycemic seizure loss consciousness past 3 month History seizure disorder ( except hypoglycemic seizure ) History heart disease include coronary artery disease , heart failure , arrhythmias Cystic fibrosis Current use oral glucocorticoid , betablockers medication , judgment investigator would contraindication participation study . History ongoing renal disease ( microalbuminuria ) . Subjects require intermediate longacting insulin ( NPH , Detemir Glargine ) . Subjects require antidiabetic medication insulin ( oral injectable ) . Presence febrile illness within 24 hour admission acetaminophen use wear CGM . The subject may reschedule Research House/Hotel Admission criterion meet . The study subject participate trial condition meet . Medical psychiatric condition judgment investigator might interfere completion protocol : Inpatient psychiatric treatment past 6 month Uncontrolled adrenal insufficiency</criteria>
