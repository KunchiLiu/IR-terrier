	<brief_summary>Primary objective : To compare telmisartan therapy + antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) versus ART alone acute Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) infection reduce systemic immune activation traffic activate HIV-infected cell central nervous system ( CNS ) , limit establishment persistence CNS reservoir HIV . At 48 week ( telmisartan therapy ) 72 week ( ~6 month cessation telmisartan augmentation ) , investigator expect subject telmisartan group reduce level blood CSF immune activation marker , reduce brain inflammation , low CSF HIV ribonecleic acid ( RNA ) improve neuropsychological testing performance . Secondary objective : In subject willing undergo optional inguinal lymph node biopsy , study determine whether subject receive telmisartan plus ART 48 week develop less lymphoid tissue fibrosis subject receive ART alone 48 week . Subject population : Male female subject age ≥ 18 year old acute HIV infection identify enrol SEARCH 010/RV254 protocol ask co-enroll study . Number subject : 21 Duration follow-up : 72 week Study design : 21 acutely HIV-infected subject randomize 2:1 treatment telmisartan + ART ( n=14 ) vs. ART alone ( n=7 ) first 48 week follow ART alone arm week 72 . Blood CSF , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , neuropsychological test exam collect baseline , week 48 week 72 . Inguinal lymph node biopsy optional procedure offer baseline week 48 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinical assessment : Neurological exam : South East Asia Research Collaboration Hawaii ( SEARCH ) employ AIDS Clinical Trials Group ( ACTG ) -derived HIV macroneurological examination , physician rat symptoms assessment cognitive feature typical HAND peripheral neuropathy Neuropsychological assessment : SEARCH employ HIV neurocognitive battery originally develop Maj et al . design minimize cultural bias test Bangkok . All subject full SEARCH battery previously publish , avoid evaluation follow invasive procedure . Quantification Drug use : Drug alcohol use assess structured interview include methamphetamine , heroin , marijuana base Thai Red Cross study define frequently abuse drug Bangkok . Urine store visit may later test illicit drug . Evidence intoxication document neuropsychological data censor . Lumbar puncture complete per standard clinical procedure use Sprotte® ( pencil-point ) needle minimize complication . Standard assessment CSF serum , protein cell count complete approximately 20cc collect ultra-centrifuged , Cell pellets blood CSF cryopreserved future potential study , subject consent . Supernatants divide 0.5cc aliquot , frozen -80oC day . Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test ( VDRL ) /Rapid Plasma Reagin ( RPR ) assess baseline follow risk new syphilis exposure report . Participant hospitalization hydration complete , need . Participants compensate time base Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) -approved rate .</detailed_description>
