	<brief_title>IT-system Development Reaching Cervix Cancer Screening Non-attenders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Non-participation screen program main risk factor cervical cancer ( Andrae et al JNCI , 2008 ) . Therefore important reduce barrier screen facilitate participation screen program cervical cancer . Offering self-sampling kit human papillomavirus ( HPV ) test examine several research study way reach woman respond screen invitation . Results population-based , randomize study western Sweden conclude offer HPV self-sampling kit screen non-attendees , 17 % cervical cancer case could avoid . Offering self-sampling kit woman attend screen organize program , lead great participation without substantial increase overall health care cost . While grow body evidence support use self-sampling , unclear strategy implement effectively context organize screen program . An alternative offer woman chance speak coordinate midwife answer question address concern regard screening . It unclear result different research study put practical use within organize screening program . Currently , woman attend screen sent annual reminder invitation . We want examine whether alternative strategy ( self-sampling contact midwife ) may work well , good , current strategy reminder invitation non-attenders . AIM The aim randomize health service study therefore test feasibility provide alternative strategy instead customary reminder invitation woman Stockholm ( so-called feasibility study , primary aim ) , whether strategy increase overall participation screening ( secondary aim ) . STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY A new IT infrastructure order self-sampling kit develop LabMed , KI . This conjunction screen database , use identify invite woman long-term non-participants cervical screening . Women participate ten year , despite annual reminder invitation , identify randomize one four strategy . 1 . A validated HPV self-sampling kit send directly woman study invitation letter instruction . 2 . An invitation order HPV self-sampling kit online application send . 3 . An invitation call coordinate midwife question concern regard screen sent . 4 . The standard annual reminder invitation send ( control , routine practice ) Women choose participate sample monitored accord standard care regional cancer screen program . HPV-positive woman follow colposcopy biopsy accord standard clinical guideline . Women invite course 3 month . All letter print advance pre-marked date . Batches send weekly check change population registry data ( individual move , take smear , die , unregistered , invitation letter sort individual marked database ) . 2 Notation abbreviation - PNR = person nummer , personal ID number 3 Study population 3.1 Inclusion criterion - Women live Stockholm past 10 year send annual reminder least per year 10 year without attend screening . Specific selection process : Include woman without `` H-prov '' record past 10 year Include woman actively send reminder invitation ( invitation type=1 ) 10 year time . In word , resident Stockholm past 10 year . Include woman age 33 3.2 Exclusion criterion Women opt screen program Hysterectomized Return sender Changed PNR Women mark Expired=1 . Women reason mark unregistered marked unregistered=1 . Women due receive reminder invitation next 3 month 4 Statistical analysis Selection study population Randomization A random selection 8000 woman choose woman meet study inclusion criterion . These 8000 woman randomize 4 study arm ( age-stratified 30-50 51-60 ) . The selection study population randomization study arm carry Anna Stoltenberg , Statistician RCC outside study group 1 . Follow-up - study end date 2016-12-31</detailed_description>
