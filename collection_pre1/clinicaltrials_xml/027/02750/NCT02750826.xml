	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled trial weight loss intervention overweight obese woman early stage breast cancer consist two arm , please see arms section information . Patients randomize 1:1 within stratification factor : menopausal status ( premenopausal vs. postmenopausal ) , hormone receptor status tumor ( ER and/or PR positive vs. ER PR negative ) , race/ethnicity ( African American vs. Hispanic vs. Other ) . The primary objective trial compare effect telephone-based intervention versus health educational control invasive disease-free survival ( IDFS ) . The total sample size 3136 patient . Patient follow primary secondary endpoint continue maximum 10 year , per standard protocol cooperative group adjuvant trial . The primary secondary objective study : Primary objective To compare effect supervised weight loss intervention plus health education material versus health education material alone upon invasive disease free survival ( IDFS ) overweight ( BMI 27-29.9 kg/m2 ) obese ( BMI ≥30kg/m2 ) woman diagnose HER-2 negative , stage II III breast cancer . Secondary objective 1 . To determine relationship change weight IDFS , explore interaction level clinical benefit weight loss intervention . 2 . To evaluate effect supervised weight loss intervention upon : 1 . Overall survival 2 . Distant disease free survival 3 . Weight 4 . Body composition ( measure waist hip circumference ) 5 . Insulin Resistance Syndrome associate condition - diabetes , hospitalization CV disease 3 . To determine impact supervised weight loss intervention IDFS within subgroup woman 1 ) hormone receptor positive breast cancer 2 ) hormone receptor negative breast cancer . 4 . To determine impact supervised weight loss intervention IDFS within subgroup 1 ) premenopausal woman 2 ) post-menopausal woman . Patients follow every 6 month first 3 year study enrollment annually 10 year registration . The intervention last 2 year disease recurrence/progression , new invasive primary cancer define protocol patient withdrawal .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Documentation Disease : 1.1 Subjects must histologically confirm invasive breast cancer registration must occur within 12 month first histologic diagnosis invasive breast cancer . A core biopsy interpret invasive cancer meet criterion ; core biopsy perform , date first histologic diagnosis date first surgical procedure identifies invasive cancer ( biopsy , lumpectomy mastectomy ) . Neoadjuvant subject evidence clinical T4 disease prior chemotherapy surgery ; eligibility neoadjuvant patient define either clinical stage prior therapy pathologic stage surgery ; patient eligible base either , eligible study . Bilateral breast carcinoma allow provided diagnosis synchronous , within 3 month one another least one two breast carcinoma meet eligibility criterion neither Her2 positive inflammatory . No evidence metastatic disease 1.2 Her2 negative , define : Insitu hybridization ( ISH ) ratio &lt; 2.0 ( perform ) Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) stain 02+ ( perform ) Deemed candidate Her2 direct therapy . 1.3 Eligible tumornodemetastasis ( TNM ) Stages include : Estrogen receptor ( ER ) Progesterone receptor ( PR ) negative ( define &lt; 1 % stain ER PR IHC ) : T2 T3 N0 , T03N13 . Note : Patients T1 , N1mi disease NOT eligible . ER and/or PR positive ( defined ≥ 1 % stain ER and/or PR IHC ) : T03N13 T3N0 . Note : Patients T12 , N1mi disease NOT eligible The eligibility neoadjuvant subject assess basis clinical ( c ) TNM pathologic ( yp ) TNM . The eligible TNM combination apply ; patient may eligible meet eligibility requirement either time point , long T4 disease prior therapy . 1.4 No history invasive breast cancer 5 year prior study registration current diagnosis ( prior ductal breast carcinoma situ [ DCIS ] time acceptable ) . 1.5 Patients must bilateral mammogram within 12 month prior registration , unless initial surgery total mastectomy , case mammogram remain breast require . ( Subjects bilateral total mastectomy require image ) . 1.6 Investigations , include chest Xray compute tomography ( CT ) chest , bone scan ( radiographs suspicious area ) abdominal ultrasound liver scan CT abdomen perform first histologic diagnosis time registration detail . Chest XRay , 2 view ( Chest CT , positron emission tomography [ PET ] /CT ) mandatory Bone scan ( xrays abnormal area ) require alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) Alkaline Phosphatase elevate sign symptom metastatic disease Abdominal imaging require ALT , AST Alkaline Phosphatase elevate sign symptom metastatic disease 2 . Prior Treatment 2.1 All adjuvant neoadjuvant chemotherapy , radiation , surgery complete least 21 day prior registration . 2.2 All triple negative patient must receive chemotherapy treat physician 's choice . 2.3 ER/PR+ patient must receive chemotherapy ( treat physician 's choice ) unless Oncotype Dx another genomic predictor score indicate low intermediate risk disease recurrence endocrine therapy alone . 2.4 Patients may breast reconstruction protocol participation , definitive breast cancer surgery must complete least 21 day prior registration . Concomitant biologic therapy , hormonal therapy , bisphosphonates acceptable . 2.5 Surgical margin must clear invasive carcinoma . If microscopic residual ductal situ disease present lumpectomy total mastectomy margin , excision highly recommend . If excision undertaken , subject may still enter study , provide addition breast chest wall irradiation , boost tumor bed deliver . In situ lobular disease margin acceptable . 2.6 All subject ( adjuvant neoadjuvant ) must sentinel lymph node biopsy and/or axillary lymph node dissection . Sentinel lymph node biopsy alone allow following instance : Sentinel lymph node biopsy negative : pN0 Sentinel lymph node biopsy positive isolated tumor cell : pN0 ( i+ ) Clinically node negative , T12 tumor sentinel lymph node biopsy positive &lt; 2 lymph node without mat node undergo breast conserving surgery tangential whole breast irradiation , undergo mastectomy chest wall irradiation . For patient positive node prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy , sentinel node alone allow neoadjuvant therapy : Sentinel node biopsy negative chemotherapy either least 2 sentinel node remove clip place involved node prior treatment . = &lt; 2 lymph node positive cancer patient participate A011202 All woman undergo breast conserve therapy must receive concomitant radiotherapy . Radiation mastectomy administer accord prespecified institutional guideline . Radiation must complete least 21 day prior registration . Patients hormone receptor positive breast cancer define must receive least 5 year adjuvant hormonal therapy form tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor , alone combination ovarian suppression . ( NOTE : patient ER PR stain less 5 % cell , hormonal therapy least 5 year strongly recommend require ) . Hormonal therapy initiate prior protocol therapy . 3 . Participants must woman 4 . Age ≥ 18 year 5 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 1 6 . Comorbid Conditions 6.1 No history malignancy within past 4 year , except malignancy &gt; 95 % likelihood cure ( e.g . nonmelanoma skin cancer , papillary thyroid cancer , situ cervical cancer ) . Patients metastatic breast cancer . 6.2 No diabetes mellitus currently treat insulin sulfonylurea . 6.3 No history serious digestive and/or absorptive problem , include inflammatory bowel disease chronic diarrhea preclude adherence study diet . 6.4 No history severe cardiovascular , respiratory musculoskeletal disease joint problem preclude moderate physical activity . Examples would include unstable angina , recent myocardial infarction , oxygendependent pulmonary disease , osteoarthritis require imminent joint replacement . Moderate arthritis preclude physical activity reason ineligibility . 6.5 No prior bariatric surgery planning undergo procedure within next 2 year study registration . 6.6 No comorbid condition would cause life expectancy le 5 year . 6.7 No history psychiatric disorder would preclude participation study intervention ( e.g . untreated major depression psychosis , substance abuse , severe personality disorder ) prevent patient give informed consent . 7 .
