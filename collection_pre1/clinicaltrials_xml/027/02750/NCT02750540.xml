	<detailed_description>DREAM-01 early phase 1 , open label , dose-escalation variable osmolarity study compare safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) , acceptability 3 formulation tenofovir ( TFV ) enema . The goal study identify dose osmolarity TFV enema human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) achieve desired colonic mucosal mononuclear cell ( MMC ) tenofovir diphosphate ( TFV-DP ) target concentration previously show confer protection HIV acquisition men sex men ( MSM ) . Each participant undergo screen evaluate eligibility . Baseline visit ass safety , PD , behavioral readout baseline . Three product describe ( Product A , B , C ) dose sequentially dose-escalation within subject . Safety , PK , PD , behavioral readout assess specify time one week dose , follow variable washout period next escalation dose . Johns Hopkins University ( JHU ) participant SPECT/CT image assess distribution permeability radiolabeled product . After two study product dos ( Product A Product C ) respective sample period , normal saline ( NS ) solution ½ normal saline ( ½ NS ) solution take home context receptive anal intercourse . Study Duration : Participant accrual take approximately 9 month participant study approximately 4-5 month . Total study duration 1 year . Study Products : Three study product administer sequentially estimate approximate TFV 1 % gel ( Product A ) , 3 time concentration dose Product A ( Product B ) , 2 time concentration dose Product B ( Product C ) define . At JHU , study product also radiolabeled Technetium-99m-DTPA ( 99mTc-DTPA ) SPECT/CT image . Take-home enemas consist normal saline ( NS ) ½ normal saline ( ½ NS ) self-administered home . - Product A : Enema formulation TFV 1.76 mg/mL ( 220 mg 125 mL ) iso-osmolar solution - Product B : Enema formulation TFV 5.28 mg/mL ( *660 mg 125 mL ) iso-osmolar solution - Product C : Rectal specific Enema formulation TFV 5.28 mg/mL ( *660 mg 125 mL ) hypo-osmolar solution - Take-home enema follow Product A : 120 mL normal saline ( NS ) solution - Take-home enema follow Product C : ½ normal saline ( ½ NS ) - Note : plan 660 mg TFV dose Product B C may adjust low high base Product A result order closely achieve target concentration - indicate *660 mg , use throughout protocol indicate plan , potentially modified Product B ( C case may ) dose .</detailed_description>
