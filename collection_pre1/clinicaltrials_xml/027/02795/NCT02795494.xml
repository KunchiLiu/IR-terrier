	<brief_title>WOMAC Hip Score Children Adolescents With Perthes Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose Perthes disease hip disorder often affect child onset four eight year age . The treatment option range non-operative bracing operative intervention . As disease often affect head femur , potential long-term condition due residual hip joint deformity , follow resolution Perthes disease , lead early degenerative hip osteoarthritis potential impact hip function , quality life , morbidity . A valid reliable mean assess function outcome essential determine effective mean treatment . Previous research use different method different subject group , make comparison result difficult . Both long-term outcome change time patient Perthes disease could measure hip joint specific patient orient outcome measure . Several measure develop adult ; specifically Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Scale ( WOMAC ) hip score use often . Though tools well study validate adult , test use pediatric population . As developed show valid , reliable , responsive adult , measure require rigourous test pediatric population prior use . 2 . Hypothesis There true global hypothesis study since validation/reliability study . There hypotheses type validity study . For construct validity ( use convergence ) , hypothesis would priori hypothesis study relate convergent validity , assume WOMAC construct validity population , hip specific outcome score different Stulberg classification stage . For construct validity ( use extreme group ) , hypothesis would priori hypothesis study , assume measure adequate construct validity population , group subject follow treatment upper extremity fracture significantly good function , indicate low score WOMAC , compare Perthes disease , high score indicate poorer function . For criterion validity , hypothesis would priori hypothesis relate criterion validity study predicts , assume adequate concurrent validity measure population , negative correlation Activities Scale Kids - Performance ( ASK-p , activity level outcome score ) WOMAC . The reason negative correlation high score generic measure indicate good function , whereas low score hip specific measure indicate good function . 3 . Research Method All subject enrol study give initial set questionnaire time recruitment ask complete home , follow clinical follow-up visit , return questionnaire mail use self-addressed , stamp envelope provide . All subject complete WOMAC . Those healed Perthes disease also complete ASK-p first visit clinic follow consent study . Those comparison group upper extremity fracture complete generic measure . This comprise initial time point study . Those subject complete require questionnaire , time point , exclude study . Radiographs affect hip pelvis obtain patient heal Perthes disease time clinic visit , would obtain regardless inclusion study course standard clinical follow-up . Those subject Perthes disease also complete WOMAC measure two week follow initial time point . The questionnaire mail subject ask complete questionnaire return self-addressed , stamp envelope provide . This comprise follow-up time point study . A reminder notification mail four week telephone call reminder six week follow initial time point second series questionnaire return . Those complete second series questionnaire exclude reliability component study maintain validity phase , provide initial questionnaire complete . Those upper-extremity fracture complete additional questionnaire follow initial time point . The Stulberg classification determine , outline , follow initial time point prior analysis data . 4 . Statistical Analysis All statistical analysis perform blind , independent analyst . All analysis , exception weight kappa statistic calculate manually , perform use S-PLUS software ( version 6.2 , Lucent Technologies , Inc. ) . The distribution questionnaire data determine use frequency histogram allow use appropriate statistical test . All statistical test perform α=0.05 . The reported value mean correspond 95 % confidence interval . Where two group compare , mean difference group 95 % confidence interval difference report . There previous study data WOMAC pediatric population . Using value obtain study adult may provide good estimate power analysis population since outcome measure , validate adult , show lack validity child adolescent . However , order estimate sample size required correlation ASK-p hip outcome measure previously report adult derive value require . On basis minimum correlation 0.6 , would consider adequate , α=0.05 80 per cent power , total 40 child require study . Since available evidence estimate correlation outcome measure , liberal sample size recruit . In similar study , except generic oppose joint specific , outcome measure use , sample size 196 subject recruit . Young et al recruit 200 subject study several psychometric property ASK-p determine . A total 200 subject recruit across center participate study . There 100 subject upper extremity fracture 100 heal Perthes disease . This sample size chosen , part , basis maximum number subject heal Perthes would feasible recruit time horizon study , six month . It anticipate minimum four center participate study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All participant 519 year Healed Perthes disease . Healed Perthes disease define radiographically , accepted fashion , appearance normal bone density femoral head . The restriction Perthes disease resolution disease prevent heterogeneity clinical presentation anticipate functional ability would occur include acute phase disease , thereby reduce potential bias . All participant able complete questionnaire English , Perthes disease , able complete questionnaire two week follow initial completion . Amongst follow orthopaedic clinic participate center upper extremity fracture , history hip disorder exclude . The reason subject compose comparison group normal hip function , consequently history hip disorder would bias comparison . Those Perthes disease demonstrate acute phase disease exclude . Acute phase disease define accepted fashion , radiographic presence fragmentation reossification femoral head . Those provide consent participation study exclude , either complete questionnaire English unable complete second set questionnaire two week . Those cognitive impairment , preclude completion questionnaire , exclude . All concomitant medical problem exclude due possible confound clinical outcome measure .</criteria>
