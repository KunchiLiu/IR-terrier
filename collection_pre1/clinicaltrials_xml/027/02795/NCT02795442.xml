	<brief_title>Daily Protein Intake Patterns Energy Metabolism Motivation Snack</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine consume 30 g high-quality protein meal increase fat utilization shift between-meal snack choice . While benefit high-protein diet well know , little know optimal amount protein eaten meal . Most Americans eat little protein breakfast lunch protein even meal . Current guideline protein base body weight ; however , recent evidence indicate absolute amount protein meal need maintain metabolically active fat-free mass . This suggest even protein consumption pattern across daily meal may positively influence energy metabolism . In addition , recent evidence indicate protein may reduce activity food reward area brain . This suggest protein may influence between-meal snack decrease relative reinforce value ( RRV ) highly reward snack food . The RRV food empirical measure motivate value energy-dense food highly reinforce , especially obese individual . This study first investigate role daily distribution protein intake energy metabolism modify snack behavior .</detailed_description>
