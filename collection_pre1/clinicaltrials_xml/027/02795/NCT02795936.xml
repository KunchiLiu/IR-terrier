	<brief_title>Feasibility Cardiac Rehabilitation Patients With Heart Failure Moi Teaching Referral Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease major driver global disease burden . Heart failure , 50 % mortality 5 year think high resource limited setting . Cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) multi-disciplinary intervention demonstrate improve functional status , quality life , reduce morbidity mortality patient heart failure . In sub-Saharan Africa , despite significant heart failure disease burden , CR largely non-existent . There compel need urgent development access CR region . However , feasibility potential utilization CR unknown . The investigator aim conduct mixed method study evaluate feasibility home base institution base CR . Participants voluntarily recruit convenience sample Moi Teaching Referral Hospital ( MTRH ) outpatient cardiology clinic . Based reasonable estimate expect subject recruitment time frame study , 25 patient recruit institution base cardiac rehabilitation ( IBCR ) arm . In consideration potentially large population wider geographical spread home base cardiac rehabilitation ( HBCR ) , 75 patient recruit HBCR arm . While study design make comparative outcome inference HBCR IBCR group , sample size large enough detect clinically significant mean post intervention increase 6 minute walk time distance HBCR arm 50m . The participant involve physical exercise , nutritional counseling educational session . Upon completion rehabilitation protocol , patient study arm also invite participate focus group discussion . Data analyze numeric data express number ( percent ) , mean ( standard deviation ) median ( interquartile range ) . Wilcoxon rank-sum Fisher 's exact test pre - post intervention comparison continuous binary variable , respectively . Focus group discussion transcribe analyzed identify discussion theme .</detailed_description>
