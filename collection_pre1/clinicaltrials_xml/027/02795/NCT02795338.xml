	<brief_summary>It unknown whether image technology broad application brain mapping due limit knowledge value result . Accurate identification area eloquent brain function vital surgical decision make preservation independence patient brain tumor higher function well survival outcome . Imaging technology evolve provide multiple non-invasive modality pre-operative test eloquent brain function include functional MRI ( fMRI ) magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) . Eloquent brain defined region control language , motor , sensory function without proper input , person would leave significant neurologic deficit . Studies conduct group others show non-invasive mapping modality provide useful information , however , information provide inconsistently predict distribution eloquent function . Direct electrical stimulation ( DES ) time surgery allow assessment eloquent function directly brain surface ( invasive ) consider gold standard brain mapping . Therefore , order determine true clinical applicability non-invasive mapping technology , propose : ( 1 ) ass predictive value fMRI MEG sensorimotor language function compare result DES ( 2 ) determine whether fMRI MEG provide consistent accurate information . We accomplish Aims co-registering mapping data ( invasive non-invasive ) modifiable 3D rendering . In way , evaluate DES fMRI MEG well compare fMRI MEG . The rationale propose research understand reliability current technology allow u perform safe surgery preserve neurologic function . The expected outcome work propose Aims 1 2 identification predictive value fMRI MEG determination one modality utilized pre-operatively accurate information . The result study expect important positive impact identification accurate pre-operative non-invasive mapping modality allow tailor test possibly lead negation need intra-operative mapping certain case . It also enhance patient outcome improve patient safety . Furthermore , serve basis multi-institutional mapping data bank .</brief_summary>
