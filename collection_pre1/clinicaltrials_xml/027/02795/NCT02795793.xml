	<detailed_description>Appendicectomy acute appendicitis one commonly perform paediatric emergency operation Australia . This standard treatment acute uncomplicated appendicitis ( AUA ) remain largely unchallenged since introduction late nineteenth century , assumption AUA progress perforation thus complication operation withheld . However , appendicectomy via laparoscopic open approach without risk . Non-operative management ( NOM ) antibiotic increasingly accept mainstay therapy many intra-abdominal infection . In fact , child appendicitis complicate perforation , abscess phlegmon formation often preferentially treat non-operatively antibiotic therapy , without percutaneous drainage . Systematic review meta-analyses demonstrate antibiotic safe effective treatment AUA adult grow evidence NOM safe effective child . Primary objective : To determine safety efficacy non-operative antibiotic management clinically diagnose likely AUA child . Secondary objective : 1 . To compare safety efficacy NOM clinically diagnose likely AUA operative management ( OM ) child . 2 . To assess cost-effectiveness NOM clinically diagnose likely AUA OM child . 3 . To assess feasibility acceptability NOM appendicitis child . This study enrol 226 patient , age 5-16 year , acute uncomplicated appendicitis two tertiary child 's hospital . Allocation ratio 1:1 make via weighted minimisation use follow criterion : age ( 5-8 year 9-16 year ) , gender ( male female ) , duration symptom ( &lt; 48 &gt; 48 hour ) .</detailed_description>
