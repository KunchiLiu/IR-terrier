	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Ramucirumab With Somatostatin Analog Therapy Patients With Advanced , Progressive Carcinoid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . The purpose study test safety effectiveness ramucirumab advance , progressive carcinoid tumor . Cancer cell make growth factor cause abnormal growth new blood vessel . Ramucirumab investigational drug work block receptor vascular growth factor , thereby prevent new blood vessel form . This may stop cancer grow spread tumor cell may die . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve Ramucirumab treatment Carcinoid Tumors .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically cytologically confirm low intermediategrade neuroendocrine tumor ( carcinoid tumor ) . Carcinoid tumor site eligible . Patients pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor exclude . Participants must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record nonnodal lesion short axis nodal lesion ) ≥20 mm conventional technique ≥10 mm spiral CT scan , MRI , caliper clinical exam . See Section 10 evaluation measurable disease . Locally advance , unresectable metastatic disease . Patients must evidence radiographic disease progression within past 12 month . Progressive disease RECIST criterion require . Age ≥ 18 year . ECOG performance status 01 ( see Appendix A ) . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/ mm3 platelet ≥100,000/ mm3 hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 × institutional upper limit normal , ≤ 5× institutional upper limit normal set liver metastasis creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit normal urinary protein ≤ 1+ dipstick routine urinalysis ( urine dipstick routine urinalysis 2+ , 24hour urine collection protein must demonstrate &lt; 1000 mg protein 24 hour ) coagulation function Adequate coagulation function define International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) ≤ 1.5 partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal . Patients fulldose anticoagulation must stable dose ( minimum duration 14 day ) oral anticoagulant low molecular weight heparin . The effect ramucirumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason antiantiangiogenic agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion Ramucirumab administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients undergone major surgery within 28 day subcutaneous venous access device placement within 7 day prior study enrollment . Patients elective plan major surgery perform course clinical trial . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients Grade 34 gastrointestinal bleeding within 3 month prior enrollment . Patients history deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , significant thromboembolism ( venous port catheter thrombosis superficial venous thrombosis consider `` significant '' ) 3 month prior registration . Patients experience arterial thromboembolic event , include limited myocardial infarction , transient ischemic attack , cerebrovascular accident , unstable angina , within 6 month prior enrollment . Patients uncontrolled poorlycontrolled hypertension ( &gt; 160 mmHg systolic &gt; 100 mmHg diastolic &gt; 4 week ) despite standard medical management . Patients congestive heart failure ( NYHA Class III IV ) , sustain ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , clinically significant bradycardia , advanced heart block within six month precede enrollment . Patients cirrhosis level ChildPugh B ( bad ) cirrhosis ( degree ) history hepatic encephalopathy clinically meaningful ascites result cirrhosis . Patients serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture within 28 day prior enrollment . Patients receive chronic antiplatelet therapy , include aspirin , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs , include ibuprofen , naproxen , others ) , dipyridamole clopidogrel , similar agent . Oncedaily aspirin use ( maximum dose 325 mg/day ) permit . Patients uncontrolled brain leptomeningeal metastasis , include patient continue require glucocorticoid brain leptomeningeal metastasis . Patients prior concurrent malignancy except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , adequately treated situ cancer , cancer patient disease free five year . Patients symptomatic cholelithiasis . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : Severely impaired lung function Any active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled infection/ disorder . Nonmalignant medical illness uncontrolled whose control may jeopardize treatment study therapy Psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition ramucirumab . Pregnant breastfeed woman exclude study ramucirumab associate potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother ramucirumab , breastfeed discontinue mother treated ramucirumab . These potential risk may also apply agent use study .</criteria>
