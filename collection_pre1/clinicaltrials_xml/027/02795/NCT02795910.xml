	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus cardiovascular disease ( diabetes CVD ) place heavy grow burden people live low middle income country . Many could healthier disease accurately diagnose correctly treat , many . Doctors nurse work primary health care clinic best place people diagnose treat , especially local clinic near free . But raise two question : 1 . How ensure diabetes CVD get priority need overload clinic ? 2 . How ensure rational evidence-based diagnosis prescribe diabetes CVD ? The investigator develop way improve primary health care people long term health condition . It patient management tool ( PMT ) , , print manual flowchart take doctor nurse symptoms diagnose treatment , test referral , advice make decision along way diagnosis , test , treatment referral . They prompt think disease health problem might undetected neglect . The package also include method train know outreach education . First trainer train , trainer train group doctor nurse workplace , show use guideline , use patient clinical problem examples . This outreach training repeat several time short session . The investigator ' research Africa show approach effective , cost effective , feasible sustainable . It roll throughout South Africa African country . But yet show effective diabetes CVD . The investigator also try evaluate Latin American country , different health system , many doctor provide primary health care . Now co-investigators Brazilian city Florianopolis decide put educational package place throughout city , agree randomise controlled trial . This clearly show whether PACK Brazil effective , cost effective feasible Brazilian condition . The core research randomise control trial . 48 primary care clinic city randomly choose either 1 ) get whole package patient management tool plus training , 2 ) get patient management tool ( expect make little difference without train ) . The investigator compare patient two group clinic see effect train . They use clinic ' electronic medical record identify 32000 adult diagnose diabetes CVD . After train start follow patient year , ass whether appropriately treat test . The primary endpoint 1 . Number participant least one follow test record : body mass index , plasma glucose , serum cholesterol , electrocardiogram , 2. participant diagnosis hypertension record previously , average systolic blood pressure record . Secondary endpoint include frequency test , number type test , diastolic blood pressure participant hypertension , serum glucose level participant diabetes , prescription indicate treatment treatment intensification , health measure ( hospital admission death ) , indicator diagnosis treatment comorbid condition depression . Eligible patient identify outcomes measure use electronic medical record .</detailed_description>
