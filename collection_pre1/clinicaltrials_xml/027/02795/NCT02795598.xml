	<brief_title>Diaphragmatic Dysfunction After Ultrasound-guided Supraclavicular Block With Single Double Injection Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator perform prospective , blind , randomize control trial ass two method supraclavicular block ( single double injection ) , resultant incidence temporary diaphragm dysfunction , hemi-diaphragmatic paresis ( HDP ) measure ultrasound . Patients forearm hand surgery ask attend anesthesiologist agree approach someone research team consent possible inclusion study . This do anesthesia preoperative assessment clinic , pre-op area day surgery ( patient see clinic ) . Once consent , patient study baseline measurement sensation movement arm surgery , well ultrasound examination movement diaphragm . Patients randomize either single double injection supraclavicular nerve block . The block perform attend anesthesiologist experience regional anesthesia , resident fellows direct supervision anesthesiologist .</detailed_description>
