	<brief_title>Neurologic Stem Cell Treatment Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Various clinical study register National Institutes Health ( NIH ) study neurologic disease damage . There also number journal report benefit treatment BMSC diseases damage nervous tissue . The investigator hope add volume literature regard use BMSC neurologic disease condition identify likely respond treatment . Intravenous administration BMSC well-established approach neurologic disease injury much support effectiveness pre-clinical clinical literature . BMSC associate bone marrow fraction posit number different mechanism may potentially improve neurologic function . In regard ability penetrate blood-brain barrier potential neuronal transdifferentiation direct impact neuron glial tissue within brain , remember within diencephalon specific circumventricular organ lie wall third ventricle . These noteworthy significantly diminish blood-brain barrier glial limitans facilitate function coordinate homeostatic mechanism endocrine nervous system . Therefore investigator believe entry BMSC may facilitate area brain . In addition Arm 1 provide intravenous BMSC , NEST Study provide treatment Arm 2 combine intravenous BMSC topical application BMSC low 1/3 nasal passage mean introduce BMSC Central Nervous System ( CNS ) . This apply bilaterally inferior nasal concha meatus . The Trigeminal Nerve 5th Cranial Nerve pair , large sensory motor nerve multiple branch . It provide sensation surface interior structure face include nasal mucosa line nose . The nerve Trigeminal Nerve provide sensation area converge enter brain level pons . There documentation scientific literature intranasal delivery BMSC allow BMSC follow pathway trigeminal nerve , facilitate entry parenchyma cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) effect CNS .</detailed_description>
