	<brief_summary>Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) multisystem autoimmune disease unknown etiology . It 's characterize activation immune system , microvascular change intimal proliferation . The EULAR/ACR 2013 criterion classification SSc help identify SSC patient fibrosis internal organ allow early treatment . Patient RP , SSc-related autoAb , anti-topoisomerase I ( SCL-70 ) , anti-centromere autoAb , anti-RNApolymerase III , abnormal nailfold capillary puffy hand would SSc . The OR abnormal capillaroscopy subsequent development SSc reach 163 positive predictive value 52 % negative predictive value 99 % .Some study find preclinical internal organ involvement pre-scleroderma patient , DLCO &lt; 80 % detect 11/32 patient RP plus SSc-associated autoAb plus SSc-type nailfold capillary change . The heritability SSc consider controversial , large publish SSc .Twin study , general suggest modest genetic contribution Phenotype .Nevertheless , study include 42 set twin , Be consider , family study 703 case , affect first-degree relative Increased risk SSc 13 time compare general population . Moreover , affect sibling increase SSc risk 15 time , Was remarkable concordance auto antibody SSc twin . Additionally , recent analysis show standardized incidence ratio SSc seem less observed autoimmune disease ( ADs ) Rheumatoid arthritis Ankylosing Spondylitis , similar observe Hashimoto , thyroiditis psoriasis . In addition , SSc prevalence , clinical Outcomes autoantibody profile report vary depend Patient ancestry Therefore , role genetic factor SSc susceptibility consider solidly establish . A positive family history SSc appear confer risk least 10-16-fold Higher normal SSc first-degree relative 10-27-fold high Normal SSc sibling , thus represent strong susceptibility factor Yet report disease .</brief_summary>
