	<brief_title>Study What Body Does Drug Subjects With Mild , Moderate , Severe Liver Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label single-dose study . Approximately 40 total subject enrol . In 3 hepatic impairment group ( mild hepatic dysfunction [ Child-Pugh score 5 - 6 ] , moderate hepatic dysfunction [ Child-Pugh score 7 - 9 ] , severe hepatic dysfunction [ Child Pugh score 10 - 12 ] ) approximately 10 subject enrol order achieve 8 subject complete study group . In addition , approximately 8 12 healthy subject non-impaired hepatic function enrol match subject hepatic impairment group . Subjects non-impaired hepatic function may match 1 hepatically impaired subject may match impaired subject different Child-Pugh category ; ie , mild , moderate , and/or severe . In order obtain match control subject , subject hepatic impairment complete study , subject non-impaired hepatic function seek ; already enrol matched control subject check match prior screen enrollment new match . Each match control subject select demographically comparable one hepatic dysfunction subject age ( ± 10 year ) , gender , weight ( ± 20 % ) . Subjects complete study may replace order achieve 8 subject complete study hepatic impairment group appropriate healthy match control subject . The study consist Screening ( Days -28 -2 ) , Inpatient Period ( Days 1 7 ) , Follow-up ( Days 8 28 ) . Screening assessment use classify degree subject 's hepatic impairment . The degree impairment assign base Child-Pugh category classification severity liver disease . Subjects admit clinical site day prior administration study drug remain inpatient discharge Day 7 ( approximately 168 hour treatment ) . Subjects may discharge Day 5 , investigator 's opinion rely upon return Day 6 7 visit . The following safety assessment perform : physical examination ; vital sign ; clinical laboratory evaluation ( hematology , prothrombin time , serum chemistry , urinalysis ) ; AE collection , ECGs , C SSRS . Blood urine sample collect analysis study drug concentration plasma protein bind . The blood sample duration ( 648 hour postdose [ Day 28 ] ) choose determine terminal half-life dasotraline , expectation time may extend hepatically impaired subject compare control subject . A blood sample pharmacogenetics collected subject provide separate inform consent collect sample . The sample utilized potential evaluation genetic polymorphism upon select enzymatic pathway ( ) responsible metabolism dasotraline ; sample optional participation study .
