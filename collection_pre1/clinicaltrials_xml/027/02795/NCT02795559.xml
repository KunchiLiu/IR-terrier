	<brief_summary>It suggest obesity occur colonic microbe obese individual , compare lean , produce short chain fatty acid fermentation dietary fiber ; mean obese individual obtain energy dietary fiber lean . On hand , possible ability colonic short chain fatty acid improve glycemic control suppress appetite may reduce obese subject . The aim study determine acute effect 2 fiber commonly use food ingredient , inulin resistant starch , postprandial serum response short chain fatty acid , glucose , insulin , free-fatty acid select gut hormone lean overweight obese subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acute Effects Dietary Fiber Postprandial Responses Lean Overweight Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The human colon ( large intestine ) contain hundreds specie bacteria exist symbiotic ( mutually beneficial ) relationship human host . The number type colonic bacteria varies different people . Recent study show overweight individual different type bacteria colon lean subject , overweight subject lose weight colonic bacteria change resemble lean subject . It suggest bacteria overweight people efficiently ferment dietary fiber thus produce SCFAs provide energy body . However , consistent study show high fiber intake associate reduced risk obesity . Some study show overweight people high concentration SCFA stool sample . But reason difference stool concentration SCFA study . Stool concentration SCFA may differ lean overweight people difference type bacteria colon , difference dietary intake maybe lean overweight people absorb SCFA produce bacteria differently . Therefore , objective study : 1. determine relationship SCFA production acute effect consume unabsorbed carbohydrate blood SCFA , FFA , glucose , insulin , c-peptide gut hormone responses lean overweight subject 2. determine type bacteria stool lean overweight subject 3. see type bacteria correlate body weight , composition diet , breath gas , fecal SCFA demographic lifestyle factor . Healthy subject BMI &lt; 25 ( lean ) 25 35 ( overweight obese ; OWO ) take part 2 phase study . In phase 1 subject record dietary intake 3 day provide stool sample analysis micro-organisms short chain fatty acid . In phase 2 overnight fasted subject study 3 occasion separate week . On occasion subject consume control test meal dextrose , dextrose plus inulin dextrose plus resistant start breath blood sample take interval 4 hour . Subjects give standardized lunch blood breath sample take next 2 hour .</detailed_description>
