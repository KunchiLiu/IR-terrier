	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Gerilimzumab´s Safety/Efficacy Patients MTX TNFα Antagonist Failed Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial include adult patient 18-80 year age active disease demonstrate inadequate response treatment MTX . Eligible patient enter 6-week screening period receive 15-25 mg MTX QWK ( patient remain current dose route administration MTX screen period ) . Patients dose MTX le 15mg QWK dose MTX increase 15mg QWK initial screen visit ) follow randomization 1:1:1:1 ratio 1 3 dos gerilimzumab ( 5 , 10 , 20 mg load dose follow 2 mg , 5 mg 10 mg gerilimzumab Q8W ) plus MTX , placebo plus MTX 12 week treatment . Gerilimzumab placebo administer SC injection Q8W ; MTX continue administer route administration ( tablet , SC , IM injection ) QWK .</detailed_description>
