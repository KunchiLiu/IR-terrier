	<brief_title>The Wire-free Invasive Functional Imaging ( WIFI ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Patients high risk one coronary stenosis evaluate routinely invasive coronary angiography ( CAG ) often combination measurement fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) assess functional significance identify stenosis . FFR assess CAG advance wire pressure transducer towards stenosis measure ratio pressure two side stenosis maximum blood flow ( hyperaemia ) induce adenosine infusion . The solid evidence FFR evaluation coronary stenosis relative simplicity perform measurement support adoption FFR base strategy many center need interrogate stenosis pressure wire cost wire drug induce hyperaemia limit widespread adoption . Quantitative Flow Ratio novel method evaluate functional significance coronary stenosis calculation pressure vessel base two angiographic projection . The purpose WIFI study evaluate feasibility QFR perform coronary angiography compare diagnostic accuracy standard FFR . Hypothesis : QFR assess CAG stenosis interrogate FFR Methods : Proof-of-concept , prospective , observational , single arm study inclusion 100 patient . Clinical follow-up telephone call one year . A stenosis indication FFR identify least two angiographic projection rotate least 25 degree around target vessel acquire resting condition . QFR calculate on-line use Medis Suite application simultaneously operator perform FFR measurement use I.V . adenosine . The QFR observer blind FFR measurement . QFR reassess off-line internal observer external core laboratory . Both blind FFR result . FFR assess core laboratory different blind observer All data enter store protect logged trial management system ( TrialPartner ) .</detailed_description>
