	<brief_title>Direct Transfer Endovascular Center Compared Transfer Closest Stroke Center Acute Stroke Patients With Suspected Large Vessel Occlusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective , multicenter , cluster randomize control , usual care condition , open , blinded-endpoint trial acute stroke patient suspect acute large vessel occlusion ( LVO ) identify EMS first assistance field , two strategy compare : transfer close local stroke center ( Local-SC ) Vs. direct transfer endovascular stroke center ( EVT-SC ) . The RACE scale ( Rapid Arterial oCclusion Evaluation ) use prehospital screen tool identify acute stroke patient suspicion LVO . Upon candidate identification , EMS contact stroke neurologist call use prehospital telestroke system confirm inclusion criterion allocate subject specific intervention accord pre-established temporal sequence . Allocation account 3 stratum : time band ( two group 12 hour ) , territory ( metropolitan versus provincial area ) week day ( work versus weekend day ) . Subjects follow 90 day post-randomization .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Suspected LVO acute stroke patient identify RACE scale score &gt; 4 prehospital setting , evaluate EMS professional attend patient , nonstroke ready center primary health center , previous transfer stroke center . Patients locate geographical area reference stroke center hospital capable offer endovascular treatment ( Primary stroke Center Telestroke Center ) . Estimated arrival time EVTSC &lt; 7 hour symptom onset . Symptom onset define point time patient last see well ( baseline ) . No significant prestroke functional disability ( modify Rankin scale 0 2 ) Age â‰¥18 Deferred inform consent obtain patient acceptable patient surrogate ( acute phase , permission use clinical data within clinical registry ) Patients coma ( NIHSS item consciousness &gt; 1 ) Patients unstable clinical status require emergent life support care Serious , advance , terminal illness anticipate life expectancy le 6 month . Suspected LVO acute stroke patient identify Emergency Department stroke center Subject participate study involve investigational drug device would impact study . Patients preexist neurological psychiatric disease would confound neurological functional evaluation . This exclude patient severely demented , require constant assistance nursing home type set live home fully independent activity daily live ( toileting , dress , eat , cook prepare meal , etc . ) Unlikely available 90day followup ( e.g . fix home address , visitor overseas ) .</criteria>
