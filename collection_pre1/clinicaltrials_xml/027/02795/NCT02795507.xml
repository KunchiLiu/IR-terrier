	<detailed_description>40 post-stroke subject recruit neurological rehabilitation department Loewenstein Hospital Rehabilitation Center , Raanana , Israel . Hospitalized patient , discharge patient department patient visit clinic department recruit . The patient randomly assign one two group : 1 ) Experimental group . 2 ) Control group . The 3 week intervention ( 15 session ) group include daily 30 minute structure training follow 30 minute standard physical therapy exercise upper limb ( conventional sensorimotor active passive exercise upper limb ) . During structured training experimental group , patient 's hand position specialized motion control apparatus ( Rehabit-Tec System ) . This device consist forearm wrist rest , finger hand individually strap device palm face . The finger connect piston move plunger potentiometer accord degree flexion . A control module read location every potentiometer finger 'moving ' hand power motor push/pull correspond hand finger equalize potentiometer 's position . Each finger channel independent act stand-alone control circuit . The device restrict voluntary movement 'other ' hand finger since 'moving ' hand finger movement activate motor . Thus hand strapped device , device turn , voluntary hand finger movement result passive yoke correspond 'other ' hand finger . The patient ` see real hand device . Visual feedback virtual hand provide VR headset use 3D gaming . The patient wear motion-sensing glove ( 5DT Data Glove Ultra ) allow online monitoring individual finger flexure hand . The training setup contain head-mounted specialized 3D camera ( PLAYSTATION Eye digital camera device ) provide online visual feedback real environment . These device allow detection patient 's real hand movement translate customize software virtual hand movement present screen . The virtual hand embed specific location space present patient look towards real hand . In group , patient move non-involved hand , receive visual feedback move virtual hand non-involved side . A passive movement ( provide kinesthetic feedback ) non-involved hand occur simultaneously device . For example : leave hemiparetic patient , movement right hand result observation leave virtual hand passive movement leave hand . The structured pre-training control group similar except patient receive visual kinesthetic feedback ( passive movement ) hemiparetic hand . The subject ask move non-involved finger accurately fast . Before intervention follow test use : Fugl-Meyer Assessment box block test motor clinical assessment test upper limb , ability move finger ( use aforementioned glove , For example : amount flexion ) . Normalized lesion data compute use ABLE module within MEDx software ( Medical Numerics ) . Only intervention , sensory ability characterize use : Fugl-Meyer assessment sensorimotor function ( Sensory section ) Semmes-Weinstein filament . In Cases specific theoretical interest , subject offer examine also fMRI/DTI use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) System - Siemens Prisma 3T scanner . The task image structure pre-training . Differences group do use t-tests Mann-Whitney , depend distribution normality correction multiple comparison . Correlations voxel-based lesion symptom mapping ( VLSM ) analyse conducted investigate relation lesion extent location responsiveness treatment .</detailed_description>
