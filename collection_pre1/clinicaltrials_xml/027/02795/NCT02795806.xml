	<brief_summary>Background : Electronic health record contain vast amount data diseases treatment . Researchers could use data test idea , would need use record group patient . But access record restrict ensure patient privacy . U.S. National Library Medicine ( NLM ) create computer tool call NLM Scrubber . This program recognize delete personal information health record . The researcher develop program need access original record . This allow see well program remove personal information patient record make accurate . Objectives : To find way improve clinical text de-identification . Eligibility : No new participant . Researchers review data already collect . Design : Researchers collect random sample report . These different doctor different field . Researchers manually remove personal information record . Researchers also automatically remove personal information original record use NLM-Scrubber . Researchers compare result computer program versus manual change . They note program remove personal information correctly . They also note program delete nonpersonal health information incorrectly . Researchers use result revise program . They keep test de-identification process complete .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NLM Scrubber : NLM Software Application De-identify Clinical Text Documents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study quality assessment , improvement , monitor automatic clinical text de-identification software application call NLM Scrubber , develop National Library Medicine ( NLM ) . The application develop clinical report use secondary scientific study ( i.e. , secondary use ) without breach patient privacy . Research method protect patient privacy development NLM Scrubber conduct follow guideline compliance HIPAA Privacy Act . In order develop improve NLM Scrubber assess de-identification performance effectively , investigator require original / unredacted sample potential clinical report type source . To end , NLM investigator collaborate entity within NIH , namely , NIH Clinical Center , BTRIS , NCI well outside entity , Kentucky State Registry administer University Kentucky researcher University Pittsburgh , state interest integrate NLM Scrubber application call Text Information Extraction System . These entity collect sample various type clinical report assess improve NLM Scrubber performance . However also need access original data order ass potential problem improve accuracy NLM Scrubber .</detailed_description>
