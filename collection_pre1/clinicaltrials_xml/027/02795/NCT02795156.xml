	<brief_summary>With increased availability next-generation sequencing , oncologists start incorporate genomic profiling routine care cancer patient . If genomic alteration identify profiling , could help guide choice therapy improve treatment outcomes . This study examine anti-tumor activity two FDA-approved therapy treat patient previously profile next-generation sequence technology fail first-line treatment one follow tumor type : non-small cell lung cancer ; urothelial cancer ; non-colon gastrointestinal cancer , upper aerodigestive tract cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Activity Molecularly Matched Targeted Therapies Select Tumor Types Based Genomic Alterations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study evaluate preliminary antitumor activity two FDA-approved targeted therapy , regorafenib ( Stivarga , Bayer ) afatinib ( Gilotrif , Boehringer Ingelheim ) patient either fail first-line treatment , standard treatment available , one follow four tumor type : 1. non-small cell lung cancer , 2. urothelial carcinoma , 3. non-colon gastrointestinal cancer , 4. upper aerodigestive tract cancer ( lip , tongue , salivary gland , gum , mouth , oral cavity , tonsil , oropharynx , nasopharynx , nasal cavity , sinus , larynx tumor ) . Approximately 160 patient ( 40 per tumour type ) plan enrollment . Consideration enrollment base result profile next-generation sequence technology perform outside protocol . Eligible patient receive one FDA-approved target agent recommend dose . The treat physician decide target agent prescribe base genomic alteration per tumor type target list package insert agent .</detailed_description>
