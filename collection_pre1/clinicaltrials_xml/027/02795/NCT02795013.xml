	<brief_summary>Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) relatively rare disorder know familiar aggregation ( i.e . HL one child , parent child ) . Because affected individual familial HL genetically relate , existence family long consider evidence support genetic basis HL susceptibility . However , largely unknown genetic variation responsible recur HL family . Because effect genetic variant likely strong familial HL , identification variation potentially reveal biological pathway critical pathogenesis HL . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To perform genome-wide sequence family recur Hodgkin lymphoma case ( affect well non-affected family member ) identify potential disease-causing germline genetic variation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : - To describe demographic clinical feature affect family .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study entail clinical interview submission peripheral blood saliva sample non-tumor DNA . Participants diagnose HL outside institution request sign release form allow outside institution send pathology report confirm HL diagnosis . If available , previously bank tumor tissue sample utilized assess genetic alteration relate HL . Detailed history obtain ( e.g. , demographic , environmental exposure , cancer risk factor , family pedigree ) facilitate analysis phenotype-genotype correlation , take account potential confounding factor . Investigators examine germline possibly tumor DNA individual participant use data participant determine gene change relate HL .</detailed_description>
