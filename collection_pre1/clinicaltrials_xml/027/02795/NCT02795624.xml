	<brief_summary>Specific Aim 1 . Characterize long-term effect secondhand smoke ( SHS ) vascular health pre-ban flight attendant ( FAs ) . Investigators measure arterial stiffness ( pulse wave velocity augmentation index ) endothelial dysfunction ( reactive hyperemia index ) pre-ban FA case , compare cardiovascular risk-factor match Framingham control . It hypothesize pre-ban FA case increase arterial stiffness ( high pulse wave velocity high augmentation index ) increase endothelial dysfunction ( lower reactive hyperemia index ) compare Framingham control . Specific Aim 2 . Determine extent remote pre-ban SHS exposure ( hour ) associate increase arterial stiffness endothelial dysfunction . Investigators hypothesize pre-ban SHS exposure positively associate increase arterial stiffness increase endothelial dysfunction . Specific Aim 3 . Investigators calculate cardiovascular risk score ( Framingham , Reynolds , ASCVD ) use subject ' age , blood pressure , family history , lipid panel , highly sensitive C-reactive protein . Investigators explore association risk score measure vascular age ( arterial stiffness endothelial dysfunction ) . These score include SHS exposure . Investigators also test additive value SHS exposure increase arterial stiffness endothelial dysfunction use risk score adjustment value . It hypothesize cardiovascular risk score associate vascular aging ( arterial stiffness endothelial dysfunction ) , association SHS exposure vascular age remain significant adjust cardiovascular risk score . The significance proposal impact ( 1 ) mechanistic insight remote SHS exposure lead hypertension vascular stiffness , ( 2 ) increase understanding SHS exposure increase risk cardiovascular disease , number one cause death United States .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator propose cohort study , investigator assess evidence accelerate vascular age 300 pre-ban FAs pre-ban SHS exposure , compare vascular measure arterial stiffness endothelial dysfunction age risk-factor match Framingham control . It hypothesize pre-ban FAs increase arterial stiffness endothelial dysfunction compare Framingham subject , relate SHS exposure .</detailed_description>
