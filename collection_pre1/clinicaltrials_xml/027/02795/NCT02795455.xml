	<brief_summary>The researcher plan explore brain network involve emotion process learn use brain scan test meal . One core feature Anorexia Nervosa ( AN ) eat small number high-calorie high-fat food . By study individual AN disgust food eating situation , researcher able understand neurobiological pathway lead restrict food intake food avoidance . This study also aim find whether one two short-term intervention ( Interoceptive Exposure ( IE ) ; Family-Based Therapy ( FBT ) ) affect connection brain treatment affect food avoidance . IE intervention help reduce anxiety eating . FBT intervention motivate patient eat work family increase value eat decrease value avoid food .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anorexia nervosa ( AN ) , characteristically relentless pursuit thinness intense fear weight gain despite significantly low body weight , serious psychiatric disorder high rate morbidity mortality . Low weight eat disorder ( LW-ED ) , broad category eat pathology include AN similar variant , characterize chronic course , poor response treatment , food avoidance . Emerging neuroimaging evidence suggest deficit insula-amygdala-ventral striatum ( IAVS ) neurocircuitry contribute individual variability aversive reward learning , brain region demonstrate abnormal response food/eating stimulus . The researcher ' pilot data suggest patient LW-ED experience difficulty extinguish food-cue association reversal learn paradigm compare healthy control , difficulty related psychophysiological measure aversive disgust ( fear ) . The researcher also successfully pilot interoceptive exposure intervention population target visceral sensitivity seek increase 'top-down ' regulation IAVS neurocircuit . The propose project ( ) use novel fMRI-EMG test relationship effective connectivity within amygdala-insula-ventral striatum network relationship psychophysiological behavioral measure acute threat reward learn 60 adolescent LWEDs 30 healthy control , ( b ) test sensitivity network experimental interoceptive exposure paradigm relative patient receive family base therapy weight restoration use dynamic causal model fMRI-EMG data pre-post experimental condition , ( c ) validate model objective measure laboratory real world eat behavior . The result study help good understand core neurocircuitry underlies threat process reward/aversive learning circuit relate objective behavior . Further , researcher determine modifiability neurocircuitry via two distinct behavioral intervention choose target different aspect affective process reward learning . These data use inform future clinical intervention target aversive/reward learn within population dysregulation insula-amygdala-ventral striatum subcircuits .</detailed_description>
