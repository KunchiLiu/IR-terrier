	<brief_summary>The classic form 21-hydroxylase deficiency ( prevalence 1/15,000 ) common cause congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH ) . This autosomic recessive disease responsible virilization external genitalia girl androgen hypersecretion fetal life . Since 1984 , Lyon Pediatric Endocrinology group propose prenatal dexamethasone ( DEX ) fetuses risk CAH With aim prevent fetal androgen hypersecretion affect girl avoid poor long-term result reconstructive surgery . Prenatal DEX use Europe USA use recently suspend : 2007 , Swedish study conduct 26 child treat DEX utero short period time report cognitive impairment . These data confirm American study short-term DEX use , show potential cognitive impairment CAH child expose DEX long period time . These confuse controversial result cause scientific community question position result suspension use prenatal DEX drastic consequence CAH girl ( virilization ; genital surgery etc. ) . In context , evaluation neuropsychological development utero DEX essential validate indication use prenatal period . This study evaluate outcome use prospective cognitive emotional assessment .
