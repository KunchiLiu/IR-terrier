	<brief_summary>Stroke one lead cause death disability UK currently cost country £7bn per year . There overwhelm need accurately rapidly triage patient allow best use finite NHS specialist resource treatment stroke . A simple blood test substance ( purine ) result cellular metabolism produce excess brain cell starve oxygen glucose ( occurs stroke ) propose . The sensor design investigator use measure blood purine procedure blood flow brain reduce allow surgical intervention major artery supply brain . Previous study investigator show soon blood flow brain reduce , purine produce within minute detectable systemic arterial blood . The current project compare level purine blood stroke patient control . The purine measure admission hospital 24 hour later . The occurrence magnitude stroke determine MRI scan give 24 72hrs admission . This study establish whether purine elevate blood stroke patient admission hospital compare healthy control , whether correlate size stroke damage brain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The SMARTChip Stroke Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke patient prospectively recruit trial admission A &amp; E . The patient undergo normal clinical assessment treatment stroke . As soon admission possible , finger-prick blood sample take patient SMARTChip device use measure level purines sample . A medical history factor relevant purine test also establish . This include factor medication might alter purine level , prior history stroke , diabetes , history ( individual family ) gout , last food . The patient also give CT head scan part normal treatment . In sub-set patient repeat blood sample ( per hour 6 hour ) take gain information purine level may change blood follow stroke . In patient , blood purine re-tested 24h ( ±3h ) . All patient offer option MRI brain scan 24-72h post-admission recruitment continue 100 patient MRI measurement enrol . The flexibility timing scan allow schedule scan fit demand MRI . The purpose scan identify nature cerebrovascular event quantify infarction area brain bleeding . Control participants give blood 2 occasion 24h apart purine test . The purpose control two-fold : 1 ) establish variability blood purine healthy control 2 ) test whether stroke patient elevate blood purine level compare healthy control . Healthy volunteer feeding control give baseline blood sample , eat simple purine rich meal ( meat sandwich ) give 4 blood sample 10 , 30 , 60 120 minute follow meal . The purpose control test whether ingestion recent meal might alter baseline blood purine measurement . Main study patient recruit University Hospitals North Midlands NHS Trust also give option participate Spasticity Pharmacokinetic sub-studies . Participants take part Spasticity sub-study provide additional blood sample measure biomarkers undergo spasticity assessment admission , 24h , 72h , 7d one two clinic visit 30-90d post-admission . Participants take part pharmacokinetic sub-group provide additional blood sample measurement glutamate biomarkers admission , 24h , 72h , 7d 30-90d post-admission .</detailed_description>
