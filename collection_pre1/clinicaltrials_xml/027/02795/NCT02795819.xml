	<detailed_description>This study single-arm , open-label , phase 1 trial determine RP2Ds AR-42 pazopanib give combination patient advance Renal Cell Carcinoma ( RCC ) Soft Tissue Sarcoma ( STS ) . Eligible patient recurrent , unresectable , metastatic RCC STS pazopanib appropriate therapy . AR-42 take orally per day 3 non-consecutive day week first 3 week 4-week cycle . Pazopanib take mouth daily continuously cycle . A modified 3+3 dose-escalation design follow maximum tolerated dos ( MTDs ) determine . Additional patient enrol total 12 patient treated MTDs . The maximum number patient need 51 expected sample size 29-35 patient enrolled period 15-35 month . Correlative study conduct use sample tumor archive follow recent surgery biopsy .</detailed_description>
