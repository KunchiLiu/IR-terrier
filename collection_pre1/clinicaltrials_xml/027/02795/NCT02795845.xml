	<detailed_description>During pregnancy , bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) , abnormal vaginal flora ( AVF ) vulvovaginal candidiasis ( VVC ) associate serious complication discomfort . Yet , treatment option limit . Lactobacilli administration suggest treat prevent vaginal infection . However , examine pregnant woman , information regard oral treatment scarce , mechanisms oral ingestion probiotic induce vaginal lactobacillus proliferation well establish . Working hypothesis : Oral probiotic effective prevention eradication vaginal infection migration lactobacilli digestive system vagina pregnant woman . Type research method data collection : randomize placebo-controlled trial . Pregnant patient symptom consist vaginal infection examine vaginal smear obtain , accord patient allocate follow group : Normal vaginal flora ( primary prevention ) Positive AVF/BV- treat oral antibiotic . Following treatment , another smear take accord patient divide : ( 1 ) patient normal vaginal flora ( secondary prevention ) . ( 2 ) patient persistent AVF/BV ( eradication ) . Positive VVC- treat vaginal clotrimazole , patient eradication include ( secondary prevention ) . In group patient divide two subgroup , receive one capsule twice day either Probiotic capsule placebo . At initial examination month study group test presence AVF/BV , candida semi-quantitative assessment vaginal lactobacillus . Additional vaginal sample take evaluate presence lactobacillus capsule .</detailed_description>
