	<brief_summary>Gliomas , especially high-grade glioma , common primary malignant brain tumor adult , yet outcomes aggressive neoplasm remain dismal.The extent resection one essential factor influence outcomes glioma resection.However , conventional structural imaging fail accurately delineate glioma margin tumor cell infiltration . investigator finish project suggest feasibility Magnetic Resonance Spectrum ( MRS ) -guided resection , unfortunately , lack sufficient clinical evidence.This prospective cohort study provide clinical evidence validity MRS-guided resection patient HGG .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study About Validity MRS-guided Resection Prognosis High-grade Glioma Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High-grade glioma ( HGG ) , include anaplastic glioma ( AG ) Glioblastomas ( GBM ) , associate poor prognosis , even scientific development last decade , attribute optimally treat maximum safe surgery , follow radiotherapy ( RT ) and/or systemic chemotherapy ( CT ) . Despite recent advance treatment , prognosis HGG remain poor comparatively short overall survival ( OS ) importantly profound impact quality life ( QoL ) .Admittedly , multiple factor related outcome , include age , biological characteristic tumor , extent treatment . Notably , extent resection ( EOR ) play major role independent modifiable factor associate improved overall progression-free survival . Achievement maximal safe resection , remove much possible tumor preserve neurological function , main goal current surgical treatment High-grade glioma ( HGG ) . Many researcher take study extent surgery , despite exist various edition , produce similar result , although one randomize control trial ( RCT ) provide 1-year PFS data significant difference total resection incomplete resection study . It suggest push delineation tumour outward well prognosis.therefore , core conservation point simon-pure margin proximate histopathologic periphery HGG.Consequently , analyse showed resection ≥ 53.21 % surround FLAIR abnormality beyond 100 % contrast-enhancing resection associate significant prolongation survival compare follow less extensive resection , neo-FLAIR abnormality region gradually come people ' vision , supportive evidence warrant relationship extensive resection reasonable prognosis , equal draw scope tumour margin put forward sketch via metabolic information . During previous clinical practice , investigator research correlation metabolic information tumour identification true-false type , study suggest Cho/tNAA ratio threshold value 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 2.0 appear predict specie-mens contain tumour respective probability 0.38 , 0.60 , 0.79 , 0.90 HGG 0.16 , 0.39 , 0.67 , 0.87 LGG , interest reveal metabolic action true-tumour , immediately work project group find difference structural metabolic volume Cho/tNAA ratio ( CNI ) thresholds 0.5 1.5 statistically significant ( p = 0.0005 0.0129 , respectively ) 0.5 1.0 statistically significant HGG.Problem , whether operation resect delineation Cho/tNAA ratio threshold 1.0 bring well outcome , remain solved , namely , investigator need clinical evidence . Based thoughtfulness , prospective cohort study provide reasonable evidence correlation metabolic-guide resection prognosis HGGs , cohorts contain 25 case arm group 25 case control group.Respectively receive different operation project follow statistical analysis aim overall survival ( OS ) progression free survival ( PFS ) .Definitively , investigator hope draw conclusion arm group well outcome , like , study step course HGG therapy .</detailed_description>
