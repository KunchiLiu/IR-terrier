	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment characterize problem sustain attention distract condition , shift attention different task demand , use work memory consistently execute intended action , result limit ability execute routine ADLs . Presently intervention demonstrate robust effectiveness reduce disability among individual cognitive impairment stroke . Recent finding suggest individual cognitive impairment may experience ADL disability part difficulty engaging , benefit rehabilitation program currently deliver . In word , individual cognitive impairment , due nature impairment , difficulty learn apply adaptive strategy currently provide traditional rehabilitation training . Therefore , intervention train individual cognitive impairment new way learn apply adaptive strategy may help benefit rehabilitation program reduce long-term disability . Cognitive Orientation daily Occupation Performance ( CO-OP ) strategy train approach train individual identify problem performance daily activity , develop strategy address problem , monitor performance course daily routine . Therefore , CO-OP teach individual `` take charge '' rehabilitation , develop adaptive behavior `` work around '' cognitive impairment meet goal . The propose project examine whether CO-OP facilitates reduction ADL disability improvement rehabilitation engagement among individual cognitive impairment acute stroke .</detailed_description>
