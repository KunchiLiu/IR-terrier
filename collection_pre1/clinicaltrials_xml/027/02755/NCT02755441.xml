	<brief_title>Early Diagnosis Pulmonary Fibrosis - Use Biomarkers Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary fibrosis secondary connective-tissue disease , environmental exposure , drug toxicity , also appear sporadically without know cause , i.e . idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis ( IIP ) . Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) common IIP usually follow rapidly progressive course short median survival time . IPF pathogenesis believe complex , include epithelial injury , resident fibroblast-myofibroblast transformation , recruitment fibrocytes , macrophage activation , release numerous cytokine chemokines . Several process release potential biomarker proteins blood stream onto epithelial surface measure . Biomarkers mainly two potential role IPF . Firstly , diagnostic biomarker would distinguish IPF diseases similar symptom , facilitate diagnosis possibly decrease need risky procedure , surgical lung biopsy . Secondly , prognostic biomarker would distinguish rapid progressors slow progressors , difficult today . This study prospectively include patient two centre Denmark patient treat IPF thus good opportunity include majority incident case IPF Denmark . The serum level several promise biomarkers measure baseline one year follow-up . Patients also follow regular clinical examination query national registry determine disease progression , mortality , healthcare utilization select co-morbidities malignancy . The database use determination risk factor outcomes list . Sub-group analysis plan respect sex , radiologic image baseline ( e.g . honeycomb ) , smoke status , co-morbidities ( pulmonary disease extra-pulmonary disease ) , disease severity baseline . A research biobank regular blood sample establish study population . This biobank , database newly diagnose IPF patient , use future research IPF .</detailed_description>
