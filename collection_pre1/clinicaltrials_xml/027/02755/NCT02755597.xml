	<criteria>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance score less equal 2 Participant document relapsed progressive multiple myeloma regimen refractory recent line therapy . Relapsed myeloma define previously treat myeloma progress require initiation salvage therapy , meet criterion refractory myeloma . Refractory myeloma define disease non responsive ( failure achieve minimal response development progressive disease [ PD ] ) primary salvage therapy , progress within 60 day last therapy . Participant must receive prior treatment least one , three , prior line therapy multiple myeloma . A line therapy consist great equal 1 complete cycle single agent , regimen consist combination several drug , plan sequential therapy various regimen . Prior treatment bortezomib proteasome inhibitor allow , provide ALL follow criterion meet : Disease NOT refractory proteasome inhibitor , define disease progression ( i.e. , PD , per IMWG European Society Blood Marrow Transplantation [ EBMT ] criterion ) receive proteasome inhibitor therapy within 60 day last dose , AND best response achieve proteasome inhibitor therapy ( alone combination ) least PR , AND participant discontinue proteasome inhibitor due intolerance great equal Grade 3 related toxicity . Participant measurable disease Screening , define least one following : Serum Mprotein great equal 0.5 g/dL , OR Urine Mprotein great equal 200 mg 24hours , OR serum immunoglobulin free light chain ( FLC ) great equal 10 mg/dL provide serum FLC ratio abnormal . Participant refractory proteasome inhibitor , define progression within 60 day last dose proteasome inhibitorcontaining regimen . Participant prior treatment proteasome inhibitor within 60 day prior first dose study drug . Participant follow condition : Nonsecretory oligosecretory multiple myeloma , active plasma cell leukemia i.e. , either 20 % peripheral white blood cell great 2.0 X 10^9/liter ( L ) circulate plasma cell standard differential , waldenstrom 's macroglobulinemia , amyloidosis , POEMS syndrome ( polyneuropathy , organomegaly , endocrinopathy , monoclonal protein , skin change ) , know Human Immunodeficiency Viral ( HIV ) infection , active hepatitis B C infection base blood screen test , significant cardiovascular disease , include uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled arrhythmia , recent myocardial infarction within 6 month randomization , congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class great equal 3 , Major surgery within 4 week prior randomization , acute infection require parenteral therapy ( antibiotic , antifungal , antiviral ) within 14 day prior randomization , peripheral neuropathy great equal Grade 3 great equal Grade 2 pain within 2 week prior randomization , uncontrolled diabetes uncontrolled hypertension within 14 day prior randomization , medical condition , opinion Investigator , would adversely affect participant 's participation study Participant history active malignancy , include myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , within past 3 year prior study entry , follow exception : Adequately treat situ carcinoma cervix uteri breast , basal cell carcinoma skin localize squamous cell carcinoma skin , prostate cancer Gleason grade 6 low AND stable Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) level treatment , previous malignancy evidence disease confine surgically resect ( treated modality ) curative intent unlikely impact survival duration study If participant prior allogeneic stem cell transplant ( SCT ) , participant evidence ongoing graftversushost disease ( GvHD ) .</criteria>
