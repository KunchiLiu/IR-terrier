	<detailed_description>Partial breast irradiation ( PBI ) become new paradigm breast cancer radiation . No type I II evidence currently available demonstrate equivalence standard whole breast radiotherapy , prospective randomize trial jointly sponsor NSABP Radiation therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) ( NSABP B-39 RTOG 0413 ) complete accrue patient , compare whole breast radiotherapy PBI , either brachytherapy external beam technique ( EB ) : result trial pending . Until result similar trial available , PBI remain research domain , offer patient context clinical experimental protocol . Despite fact less extensive experience brachytherapy available , PBI delivery external-beam many advantage . First , likely acceptable patient since non-invasive require surgical procedure anesthesia . Moreover , since deliver surgery , pathological analysis segmental mastectomy specimen available inform selection best candidate . In addition , EB-PBI likely become widely reproducible , since rely experience skill radiation oncologist perform brachytherapy implant . Besides , technique establish , widely apply facility provide linear accelerator , without risk present brachytherapy approach complete unfavorable interplay patient 's anatomy technical limitation applicator . Finally , term health care economics , external beam approach spar cost extra surgical procedure several day inpatient ( case Low dose Rate ( LDR ) brachytherapy ) . A prone approach partial breast radiation test NYU clinical trial sponsor IDEA grant Department Defense ( NYU 00-23 ) . Results first 47 patient accrue originally demonstrate feasibility . Eligibility study limit post-menopausal woman non-palpable , mammographically detect tumor . In addition , protocol require patient first refuse undergo standard six-week radiotherapy . Five fraction 6 Gy deliver Planning Target Volume ( PTV ) ten day ( Monday-Wednesday-Friday , Monday-Wednesday ) . The dose fractionation base radiobiological modeling , aim determine dose deliver five fraction would achieve equivalence tumor control estimate 50 Gy 25 fraction , maintain risk fibrosis tumor bed comparable standard regimen 60 Gy 30 fraction . An α/β = 4 tumor control use , validity recently confirm result prospective randomized trial compare accelerate standard whole breast radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
