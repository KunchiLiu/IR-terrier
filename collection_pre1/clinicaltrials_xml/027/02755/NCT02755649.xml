EASI score ≥20 screen baseline visit 4 . IGA score ≥3 ( 0 4 IGA scale ) screen baseline visit 5 . ≥10 % body surface area ( BSA ) AD involvement screen baseline visit 6 . Documented recent history ( within 6 month screen visit ) inadequate response treatment TCS 7 . Have apply stable dose topical emollient ( moisturizer ) twice daily least 7 consecutive day immediately baseline visit 8 . Documented history physician either : 1 . No prior CSA exposure currently candidate CSA treatment due : medical contraindication ( eg , uncontrolled hypertension medication ) , use prohibit concomitant medication ( eg , statin , digoxin , macrolide , antibiotic , barbiturate , antiseizure , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug , diuretic , angiotensinconvertingenzyme inhibitor , St John 's Wort , etc ) , increased susceptibility CSAinduced renal damage ( elevated creatinine ) liver damage ( elevated function test ) , increase risk serious infection , hypersensitivity CSA active substance excipients OR 2 . Previously expose CSA , CSA treatment continue restart due : intolerance and/or unacceptable toxicity ( eg , elevated creatinine , elevate liver function test , uncontrolled hypertension , paraesthesia , headache , nausea , hypertrichosis , etc ) , inadequate response CSA ( define flare AD CSA taper maximum 6 week high dose [ 5 mg/kg/day ] maintenance dose [ 2 3 mg/kg/day ] flare minimum 3 month maintenance dose ) . Flare define increase sign and/or symptom lead escalation therapy , increase dose , switch higherpotency class TCS , start another systemic nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drug requirement CSA dose &gt; 5 mg/kg/day , duration beyond specify prescribe information ( &gt; 1 year ) 1 . Participation prior dupilumab clinical study 2 . Treatment investigational drug within 8 week within 5 halflives ( know ) , whichever longer , screen visit 3 . Hypersensitivity and/or intolerance corticosteroid ingredient contain TCS product use study 4 . Systemic CSA , systemic corticosteroid , phototherapy within 4 week prior screen , azathioprine ( AZA ) , methotrexate ( MTX ) , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , Janus kinase ( JAK ) inhibitor within 8 week prior screen 5 . Treatment TCI within 1 week screen visit 6 . Treatment biologics follow : Any celldepleting agent include limited rituximab : within 6 month screen visit , lymphocyte count return normal , whichever long Other biologics : within 5 halflives ( know ) 16 week prior screen visit , whichever longer 7 . Regular use ( 2 visit per week ) tan booth/parlor within 4 week screen visit 8 . Treatment live ( attenuate ) vaccine within 12 week screen 9 . Active chronic acute infection require treatment systemic antibiotic , antiviral , antiparasitics , antiprotozoal , antifungal within 2 week screen superficial skin infection within 1 week screen visit . NOTE : patient may rescreened sooner 2 week infection resolve 10 . Known suspected history immunosuppression , include history invasive opportunistic infection ( eg , tuberculosis [ TB ] , histoplasmosis , Listeriosis , coccidioidomycosis , pneumocystosis , aspergillosis ) despite infection resolution ; unusually frequent , recurrent , prolonged infection , per investigator judgment 11 . Presence 1 follow TB criterion : 1 . A positive tuberculin skin test screen visit 2 . A positive blood QuantiFERON®TB TSpot test screen visit 3 . Chest xray ( posterioranterior lateral view ) screen within 3 month screen visit ( radiology report must available ) result consistent prior TB infection ( include limited apical scarring , apical fibrosis , multiple calcify granuloma ) . This include noncaseating granuloma . NOTE : Any 3 TB test perform countrybycountry basis accord local guideline require regulatory authority ethic board . 12 . History human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection positive HIV serology screen 13 .
