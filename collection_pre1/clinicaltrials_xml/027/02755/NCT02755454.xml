	<brief_summary>The goal study determine specific perfusion pattern radiation induce lung change residual/recurrent lung malignancy patient treat stereotactic body radiotherapy SBRT thus improve distinguish radiation change residual/recurrent lung cancer . Currently CT often unable make clear differentiation benign malignant change lung SBRT treatment necessitate additional wait time perform follow CTs biopsy . Optimal treatment may delay . The investigator want apply CT perfusion sequence addition routine follow CTs goal obtain perfusion value post treatment lung change lung tumour . The investigator ' hypothesis CT perfusion value help differentiate benign post radiation change residual/recurrent tumour lung high confidence may help avoid unnecessary delay cancer treatment .</brief_summary>
