	<brief_summary>The role transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) standard therapy intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) challenge increase study show liver resection ( LR ) safe feasible procedure well survival outcomes TACE . In light , investigator construct Markov model simulate compare LR TACE treatment intermediate-stage HCC . The result suggest LR may provide survival benefit TACE treatment intermediate-stage HCC cirrhotic patient . However , validate simulate result study high quality ( e.g . prospective clinical trial ) would great value provide convince find . Therefore , base establish Markov model , investigator aim prospectively compare treatment efficacy safety LR TACE consecutive patient intermediate-stage HCC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liver Resection Versus Transarterial Chemoembolization Treatment Intermediate-stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) 5th common cancer worldwide third frequent cause death cancer . However , management strategy intermediate-stage HCC remain controversial without global consensus . On one hand , Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer ( BCLC ) stag system recommend liver resection ( LR ) early early-stage HCC , transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) intermediate-stage HCC . On hand , observational study Eastern Western country emerge suggest LR safe achieve well survival TACE patient intermediate-stage HCC , study conduct directly compare LR TACE patient . In light , investigator conduct multistate Markov model simulate randomized clinical trial compare LR TACE follow-up period 15 year . The result suggest LR may provide survival benefit TACE treatment intermediate-stage HCC cirrhotic patient . However , validate simulate result study high quality ( e.g . prospective clinical trial ) would great value provide convince finding.Therefore , base establish Markov model , investigator aim prospectively compare treatment efficacy safety LR TACE consecutive patient intermediate-stage HCC .</detailed_description>
