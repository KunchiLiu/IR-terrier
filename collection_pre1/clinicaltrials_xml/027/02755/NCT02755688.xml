	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common heart arrhythmia . Many people symptom aware AF . Others may feel dizzy , short breath , feel tired become aware fast irregular heart beat ( palpitation ) . The main complication AF increase risk stroke incidence heart failure . There two key aspect treatment AF . The first protection stroke , treat oral anticoagulant . Treatment AF either control rate ( frequency contraction ) control rhythm ( restore regular contraction ) . Rate-control generally employ first intent reduce rate lower pump chamber contract improve efficiency . Appropriate medication use treatment strategy accept AF present long term heart rhythm . If symptom persist despite medication prefer strategy restore sinus rhythm ( SR ) regular contraction pump chamber heart . This do electric shock treatment ( DC cardioversion ) together long-term tablet medication , definitive 'cauterisation ' therapy ( catheter thoracoscopic surgical ablation ) . In study investigator study patient symptomatic long stand persistent AF ( continuous AF 1 year ) try failed drug and/or electrical therapy . At present investigator know best ablation technique treat symptomatic , long-standing persistent AF ( LSPAF ) . Catheter ablation ( CA ) widely available invasive treatment available AF . Thorocoscopic surgical ablation ( SA ) widely available hospital expertise conduct procedure . CA show achieve modest degree success restore normal SR caveat patient require 'multiple ' procedure ( usually two three ) . SA offer patient alternative choice therapy keyhole surgical thoracoscopic ) approach . It may higher single procedure success rate although potential great complication rate . The investigator aim examine detail help u understand approach might better manage LSPAF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Catheter Ablation Versus Thoracoscopic Surgical Ablation Long Standing Persistent Atrial Fibrillation ( CASA-AF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center randomise control study catheter ablation compare totally thoracoscopic surgical ablation . The study population patient age 18 symptomatic long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation ( ≥1≤5 year ) good leave ventricular function least one anti-arrhythmic drug ( AAD ) fail , drug contraindicate tolerate . Subjects randomise thoracoscopic Surgical Ablation undergo minimally invasive , thoracoscopically assist , surgical ablation isolate pulmonary vein ( PVI ) use radiofrequency ( RF ) clamp device . Posterior wall isolate box fashion cool rail bipolar RF device . This include ganglionated plexi ablation +/- LAA excision/exclusion . Catheter Ablation Group Patients undergo pulmonary vein isolation linear ablation leave right atrium . There 3 month blank period symptomatic atrial arrhythmia may catheter ablation period 12 month follow . The primary end point study assess continuous cardiac record internal loop recorder insert end index procedure . The analysis reporting recording perform blind core lab .</detailed_description>
