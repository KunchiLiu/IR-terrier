	<detailed_description>Peritoneal Dialysis ( PD ) main method treatment Thai End-Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) patient `` PD First '' policy Universal Coverage ( UC ) scheme . The increased demand result supply chain logistical problem , also product quality concern . Peritonitis , main complication main cause failure CAPD patient , could cause product defect . PD Product Check List develop base 28 routine step standard orientation manual new Thai PD patient . Of , step 2 ( weight PD solution bag ) , step 3 ( check expiration date , volume , glucose concentration , clarity , color , step 27 ( weight PD solution bag ) , step 28 ( record time , volume , abnormality encounter ) relevant product defect report . This cluster randomize trial conduct 22 Thai participate PDOPPS center ( 20-25 prevalent 10-15 incidence PD case per center ) answer primary research question : check list intervention effective reduce peritonitis rate ? The secondary research question also consider : check list help increase number product defect report ? Peritonitis incidence rate primary outcome , define base International Society Peritoneal Dialysis ( ISPD ) 2010 recommendation . Product defect incidence secondary outcome , measure number incidence product defect report patient . Given standard definition , PD solution product consider defective expire day use , incorrect glucose concentration , abnormal clarity color , physical abnormality box and/or bag , loosen connector . Because nature intervention , blind possible . The randomization list generate separately participate PD center use random permute block method block size two . Patients randomly allocate either study control group 1:1 ratio . While subject receive standard PD care , study subject also receive check list plus 30-minute orientation use check list .</detailed_description>
