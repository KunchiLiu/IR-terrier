	<detailed_description>The potential non-invasive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) therapeutic tool improve schizophrenic symptom , particular resistant hallucination , increasingly study past decade . Several study demonstrate low-frequency pattern repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) leave temporoparietal junction ( TPJ ) , know decrease local activity , significantly reduce auditory verbal hallucination schizophrenic patient . In spite highly promising result , high level inter-individual variability response non-invasive brain stimulation treatment , fact rTMS may prove ineffective patient , keep spur controversy efficacy approach currently perform , increase efficacy consistency . To date , study aim explain variability , fact , good understand common phenomena neurostimulation domain would clearly increase effectiveness treatment , lead individualize therapeutic approach specifically tailor condition patient . Moreover , many question stand , particularly regard influence rTMS treatment anatomical functional connectivity schizophrenic patient . Accordingly , objective project good understand impact rTMS brain patient resistant auditory hallucination , use information well understand condition develop efficient consistent therapy . The investigator hypothesize baseline difference anatomical and/or functional connectivity responder non-responder patient treat rTMS . Therefore , project aim determine anatomical functional connectivity marker response rTMS treatment patient schizophrenia . For , investigator compare patterns diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) white matter tractography resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) data responder non-responder patient rTMS treatment . Moreover , investigator believe rTMS increase functional connectivity frontal temporo-parietal cortex schizophrenic patient associated improvement auditory hallucination . Therefore , second objective work evaluate impact rTMS functional connectivity patient schizophrenia compare DTI resting-state fMRI data rTMS treatment responder non-responder patient .</detailed_description>
