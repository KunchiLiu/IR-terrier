	<brief_summary>Caesarean section one common operation worldwide , rate globally increase . A multitude effort do aim reduction Caesarean section relate maternal morbidity ; relate technical modification open close abdominal uterine incision . The comparative study blunt versus sharp extension uterine incision show reduction incidence unintended extension 8.8 % 4.8 % . The vulnerability low uterine segment tear related stage labor . The frequency unintended extension report 15.5 % , 35.0 % case operate first second stage labor respectively . The original technique fetal head extraction entail introduction obstetrician hand instrument low uterine segment . This put low uterine segment risk damage incision extension consequence increase blood loss , increase operative time , infection adhesion blood transfusion . Adherence available generate good quality evidence base practice Caesarean section anticipate decease morbidity ( 4-6 ) . The idea present technique derive fact vaginal delivery main task obstetrician support perineum fetal head extend get birth canal .</brief_summary>
