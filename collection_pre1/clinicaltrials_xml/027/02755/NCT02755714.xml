	<brief_summary>Exercise Induced Laryngeal Obstruction ( EILO ) condition uncommon otherwise healthy young people . EILO cause posteromedial collapse supraglottic structure medialization vocal fold , , high intensity exercise . There currently treatment available properly evidence base . However , case report suggest possible effect `` asthma drug '' Ipratropium Bromide ( Atrovent® ) . The current project open label pilot study , aim test Atrovent influence occurence EILO , either postpone onset exercise fully prevent condition occur .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atrovent Exercise Induced Laryngeal Obstruction ( EILO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise induce inspiratory symptom ( EIIS ) increasingly recognize important differential diagnosis exercise induce asthma ( EIA ) otherwise healthy adolescent . EIIS often link laryngeal abnormality , often label exercise induce laryngeal obstruction ( E-ILO ) . In unselected population , E-ILO find 7.5 % 5.7 % adolescent . Causal mechanisms remain unclear , variety structural and/or functional pathway propose , abnormality relate epiglottis , laryngeal cartilage-skeleton support , mucosal structure well laryngeal muscular system nerve supply . All abnormality might conceivably disturb airflow way laryngeal inlet , increase turbulence airflow resistance , thereby set sense dyspnea trigger symptom characteristic EIIS . Additionally , various psychological characteristic propose implicated causal cascade . As causal mechanism E-ILO clarify , attempt treatment condition empirical currently properly evidence-based treatment available . Speech therapy , often combination kind psychotherapy , view mainstay therapy author , whereas psychological measure relaxation therapy , hypnosis biofeedback advocate others . Anticholinergic aerosols apply exercise suggest report successful surgical treatment use laser supraglottoplasty . The common goal treatment initiatives increase size laryngeal inlet increase airflow velocity induce increase exercise intensity . Inducible laryngeal obstruction previously often labeled vocal cord dysfunction ( VCD ) , Ayres et al . propose 2002 article Thorax VCD could function altered autonomic balance . This view open theoretical framework treatment VCD use inhaled anticholinergic agent Ipratropium bromide ( Atrovent® ) . To knowledge , positive effect inhale anticholinergic agent VCD far publish case report , systematic study perform . This study aim address potential effect Atrovent patient E-ILO verified continuous laryngoscopy exercise ( CLE ) test . The study primarily include 20 patient consecutively refer clinic EIIS diagnose E-ILO routine CLE test . Requirement inclusion CLE score ≥ 3 . The primary endpoint laryngeal response maximal exercise , describe quantitatively blind observer use CLE score system . Two CLE test perform subject , one - one without - prior treatment Atrovent . The patient thus serve her/his control . Half patient receive Atrovent first study test ( T1 ) , half second ( T2 ) . The CLE-test The CLE-test describe detail author Heimdal et al . `` Laryngoscope '' 2006 score system Maat et al . `` European Archives Otorhinolaryngology '' 2009 . In short , test combine full cardio-pulmonary treadmill exercise set-up continuous real-time transnasal video-laryngoscopy apply rest peak exercise rest . A camera microphone place front subject enable record simultaneous video image external upper part body well record respiratory sound . The subject run treadmill accord standardize protocol , incrementing speed and/or grade every minute aim obtain peak oxygen consumption ( peakVO2 ) 6-12 min exercise . The test consider successful patient experience respiratory complaint , indicate exhaustion , preferably support plateau oxygen consumption and/or heart rate . All recording continue normal breathing regain . The CLE-test scoring system establish base evaluation video recording patient symptom-negative control examine CLE-test . The CLE-test scoring system encompass separate assessment extent medial rotation aryepiglottic fold adduction vocal fold score representative respiratory cycle two different point time exercise session ; i.e . moderate effort ( change walk run treadmill ) maximal effort ( shortly exhaustion ) . Adduction grade 0 ( neutral position abduction ) maximum score 3 . This set-up establishes four sub-scores range 0 3 , i.e . glottic supraglottic adduction moderate ( A B ) , maximal exercise ( C D ) . The sum score ( E ) may finally categorize three cluster : 0-2 ( normal ) 3-4 ( moderate ) 5 ( severe ) .
