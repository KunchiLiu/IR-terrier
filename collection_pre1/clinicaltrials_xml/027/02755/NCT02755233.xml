	<brief_summary>Serial spirometry measurement CO-diffusion capacity ( DLCO ) patient MM treatment ipilimumab perform . A reduction baseline force vital capacity ( FVC ) ≥10 % , ≥15 % DLCO define clinically meaningful , thus indicative pulmonary toxicity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab-induced Lung Toxicity : Observational Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim prospective observational study determine prevalence ipilimumab lung toxicity define significant decline diffuse capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) and/or force vital capacity ( FVC ) patient MM . Patients age 18 year establish diagnosis MM treat follow Department Dermatology ask participate study indication treatment ipilimumab give interdisciplinary skin tumorboard conference . After write informed consent obtain , patient undergo baseline evaluation ( V1 ) include medical history , physical examination , laboratory analysis ( hemoglobin , leucocytes count , C-reactive protein , pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) spirometry measurement DLCO . Thereafter , first dose ipilimumab ( 3mg/kg ) give intravenously period 90 minute without premedication . The subsequent three dos ipilimumab administer three weekly analogue dose . Subsequent study visit ( V2 , V3 , V4 ) include PFTs schedule day ipilimumab administer . Thus , study visit thoroughly adapt clinical visit , give administration ipilimumab ( total four injection separate three week ) . In case new respiratory symptom study period , additional PFTs high-resolution compute tomography ( HR-CT ) chest perform . In case early study termination follow-up pulmonary function test value already obtain use final analysis .</detailed_description>
