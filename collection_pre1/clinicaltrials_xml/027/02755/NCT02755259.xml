	<brief_title>Acute Hemodynamic Effect Acetazolamide Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) various etiology cause dyspnea , impairs exercise performance associate reduce quality life ( QoL ) survival . Treatment option include therapy underlying cause , pulmonary vasodilator drug , oxygen , select case , pulmonary endarterectomy lung transplantation . Unfortunately , PH specific drug expensive , associated side effect even combine pharmacological treatment often sufficient achieve clinical benefit . Therefore , novel therapeutic drug need . The investigator recently demonstrate sleep related breathing disorder , common PH patient , improve nocturnal oxygen therapy acetazolamide ( AZA ) . AZA carbonic anhydrase ( CA ) inhibitor act respiratory stimulant thereby improve oxygenation possibly PH . There even data suggest CA-inhibitors direct pulmonary vasodilator effect . However , potential role AZA treatment PH conclusively study . Therefore , purpose current project investigate , acute hemodynamic clinical effect AZA PH patient .</detailed_description>
