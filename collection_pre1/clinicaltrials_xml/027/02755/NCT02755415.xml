	<brief_title>Clinical Applicability Robot-assisted Gait Training System Acute Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke second lead cause mortality Taiwan , also primary cause long-term physical psychological disability society . Array reason suggest obstacle stroke patient receive adequate physical rehabilitation , include lack physical capacity , severe neurological deficit loss strength . Given critical importance high-intensity high-repetitiveness early rehabilitation stroke patient achieve sustainable long term outcome , robot-assisted gait rehabilitation device gain great interest last decade slowly become part clinical rehabilitation program stroke patient . However , despite grow interest significant resource invest development robot-assisted rehabilitation device , still lack empirical evidence clinical applicability stroke patient . Moreover , available evidence date mostly focus sub-acute chronic stroke patient investigation acute stroke population , especially complete incapacitation ambulation , sparse . It therefore aim propose project fulfil significant gap clinical knowledge comparatively investigate clinical applicability recently develop HIWIN Robotic Gait Training System ( MRG-P100 ) traditional rehabilitation program emphasis determination psychological functional capacity recovery status acute stroke survivor .</detailed_description>
