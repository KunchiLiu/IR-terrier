	<brief_summary>Respiratory virus include influenza respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) among important cause severe disease globally , infect everyone repeatedly throughout life . Understanding prevent infection incomplete boost immunity vaccine remain best strategy . T cell show animal essential clear respiratory viral infection likely helpful stimulate vaccine . However , cell originate develop human lung still unclear . The investigator inoculate volunteer influenza RSV examine relationship T cell blood lung outcome infection . By track specialised cell , investigator aim develop well understanding generated order harness future vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Protective Immunity Against RSV Influenza Experimental Human Challenge Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) two common cause severe viral respiratory tract infection . Seasonal influenza overall incidence 10-20 % per annum frequent complication , annual mortality USA estimate 9.9 death per 100,000 . According World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate , RSV cause around 64 million infection per annum 160,000 death . It lead cause severe respiratory illness young child ( associate severe infant wheeze illness ) also significant problem susceptible adult ( include elderly airway disease ) RSV responsible around 22 % winter respiratory illnesses case fatality rate 2-8 % . No vaccine specific antiviral available RSV license influenza remain suboptimal . Further understanding human immune response virus particularly context respiratory tract therefore essential . Experimental human infection study advantage study pathogen natural host capacity sample different anatomical site intensively . Thus investigator aim use model help test vaccine therapeutic well provide critical information immunity pathogenesis . The investigator use previously characterise Good Manufacturing Practices-certified RSV influenza virus derive recent clinical isolates investigate response infection healthy adult volunteer . Subjects recruit via advertisement screen Imperial College London . Healthy individual enrol study undergo baseline investigation include sample blood , upper low respiratory tract . They inoculate RSV influenza intranasal drop quarantine 10 day . During time , blood respiratory sampling . After 10 day isolation period , discharge follow 6 month post-infection . These sample undergo analysis antibody , B T cell response correlate outcome inoculation , may include infection , asymptomatic symptomatic infection . Thus investigator infer role immune correlate protection infection symptomatic disease .</detailed_description>
