	<brief_title>Effects Osteopathic Techniques Residual Volume Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) characterize progressive fully reversible airflow limitation bronchus . Hyperinflation one important pathophysiological mechanism responsible shortness breath COPD patient . Hyperinflation may assess body pletysmography residual volume ( RV ) total lung capacity ( TLC ) measure . These parameter consider precisely reflect degree hyperinflation . In patient COPD , increase breathing frequency , e.g . exercise disease exacerbation , lead dynamic hyperinflation increase shortness breath . The treatment COPD include smoke cessation , drug therapy , home oxygen therapy rehabilitation . The disease chronic , progressive ultimately lead premature death , every new therapeutic option point interest . In recent year , report positive effect osteopathic technique pulmonary function test patient COPD . Osteopathy new area healthcare , manual technique use assess neuro-musculoskeletal performance optimize function . STUDY OBJECTIVE assessment influence select osteopathic technique RV patient COPD ( III , IV degree airway obstruction accord Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease - GOLD ) . MATERIAL The patient recruit outpatient clinic randomly assign 2 group : - group osteopathic manual therapy ( OMT group ) - 10 patient - undergo 25 minute manual osteopathic therapy ; - control group ( C group ) - 10 patient - undergo 25 minute manual therapy aim decrease hyperinflation , placebo . Then , period two-three week patient cross group . METHODS Spirometry assess force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) force vital capacity ( FVC ) body pletysmography measurement RV perform 10 minute manual therapy session . Manual therapy direct normalization autonomic nervous system ( inhibition sympathetic nervous system ) improvement chest wall mobility apply . The technique painless patient . In investigated group , technique apply supine position , daily inhale medication intake . The technique apply OMT group include : - suboccipital decompression - base pressure suboccipital muscle finger therapist base skull . - deep cervical fascia release - therapist move thumb neck patient cranium caudal direction sternocleidomastoid , scalene , trapezius muscle . - thoracic lymphatic pump activation - therapist manually support breathe rhythm patient compression decompression sternum effect sterno-costal joint relaxation intensification lymph flow lymphatic thoracic duct . The impact thoracic duct carry rhythmic pressure difference breathe support hand therapist . - stretch diaphragm - technique relies manual catch 10 , 11 rib cartilage , hold inspiratory direction exhalation patient . The therapist decide subsequent technique terminate base improvement flexibility mobility treat area evaluate palpation . The technique apply C group include : - manual mobilization technique slide shoulder joint toward front , rear bottom . - manual technique increase range motion shoulder joint use patient 's breathing manoeuvre .</detailed_description>
