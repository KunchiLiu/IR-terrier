	<brief_summary>Some medication take breastfeed woman excrete milk , pose potential risk toxicity infant . The first line evidence require toxicity risk assessment prediction drug level milk . However , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) information drug excretion milk largely lacking , limited data case report . This make difficult provide population-level prediction drug level milk . The lack data topic jeopardize maternal adherence drug therapy breastfeeding also establishment breastfeeding , even drug consider safe nursing . Clearly , clinical problem drug safety important woman 's health issue , affect mother infant . `` Drugs Lactation '' Analysis Consortium ( DLAC ) `` drug-in-milk '' monitoring network , design platform efficient collection patient milk sample real world set generate population prediction drug excretion level human milk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OVERARCHING GOAL OF DLAC : To establish post-marketing `` drug-in-milk '' monitoring system nursing woman prescribe use medication . Drugs Lactation Analysis Consortium ( DLAC ) provide risk assessment data tool toxicity detection form population estimate variation drug level mother 's milk infant plasma several common medication real world setting . SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES : - To generate data drug level breast milk use population pharmacokinetic ( pop PK ) approach - To develop popPK model describe drug level milk - To simulate/predict drug level milk population , base pop PK model SCOPE AND RATIONALE : Information extent drug excretion mother 's milk lacking , mainly due follow two reason : 1 ) nursing woman exclude drug trial ; 2 ) ethical practical difficulty conduct intensive-sampling PK study breastfeed mother . Even data exist , base small number patient , difficult translate information population estimate drug level milk . DLAC develop novel drug safety network use population PK ( popPK ) modeling approach , allow population-level PK parameter estimation , model simulation base scheme sparse sample per individual , systematically collect large number nursing woman medication real world set . This approach provide population risk estimate probability distribution reach certain drug level milk plasma . Equipped versatile drug analysis core popPK model simulation unit , DLAC able generate PK estimate population context breastfeeding .</detailed_description>
