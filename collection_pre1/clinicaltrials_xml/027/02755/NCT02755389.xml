	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial investigate utility apneic oxygenation via nasal cannulae post-induction set purpose prolong safe apneic time . Three group compare , control group 0 L/min , 15 L/min 60 L/min group . The primary outcome difference partial pressure oxygen arterial blood ( PaO2 ) group throughout nine-minute apneic period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Apneic Oxygenation Via Nasal Cannulae : 15 L/Min v High-Flow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Airway management life save therapy . One major complication may occur airway management lack oxygen blood . If severe prolong , lack oxygen result permanent brain damage , damage vital organ even death . Strategies already exist help prevent lack oxygen blood ( hypoxemia ) , however research involve new way oxygenate patient may help minimize chance hypoxemia airway management . Apneic oxygenation novel method deliver oxygen patient despite lack active respiration ( i.e . patient breathing investigator provide patient artificial breath ) . The simple least invasive method provide apneic oxygenation application oxygen nasal cannulae airway management . Several different technique provide apneic oxygenation via nasal cannulae previously describe ( 1-3 ) , however randomize trial compare method exist . This study examine change time amount oxygen dissolve blood ( PaO2 ) three treatment group : control group ( apneic oxygenation ) , 15 L/min group 60 L/min group . This data help determine extent benefit apneic oxygenation provide setting .</detailed_description>
