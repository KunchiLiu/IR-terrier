	<brief_summary>Background : Cellular senescence age cell . It complex process may connect age age-related disease . It unknown cell appear around wound site human day skin injury difference young old individual . This study do look cell body respond small skin wound . This information may help treat age-related disease . Objective : To study cell body respond small skin wound . Eligibility : Healthy adult age 20-39 70+ Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood sample . They fast screen visit . Women urine pregnancy test . Participants 3 study visit 3 week . Visits 1 2 : Participants fast blood take . Women urine test . All participant 2 skin biopsy . A spot upper arm numb . Two small piece skin remove . They keep area cover next visit . Visit 3 : Participants vital sign take . Their biopsy wound measure photographed .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Skin Cells That Stop Replicating ( Senescent ) During Wound Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives Specific Aims : The objective proof-of-concept study understand physiological role senescent cell human age process use model wound heal . Cellular senescence phenomenon normal cell cease divide response stress . We aim determine healthy human : ( 1 ) senescent cell appear around wound site day skin injury ; ( 2 ) number senescent cell induce skin injury increase age ; ( 3 ) wound heal process , determine size heal wound , alter aging ; ( 4 ) biomarkers senescence-associated secretory phenotype ( SASP ) increase significantly tissue around wound day skin injury , magnitude increase high old compare young person . We also want describe change occur age DNA methylation histone acetylation , gene expression , protein expression within senescent cell comparison normal tissue . Experimental Design Methods : Twenty healthy participant , ten age 20-39 year ten 70 year old old recruit pilot study . Of ten participant age group , five men five woman . Each participant two 3mm skin biopsy inner upper arm baseline visit ( visit 1 ) two 6mm skin biopsy concentric previous site Visit 2 . Visit 2 scheduled 5 different day ( day 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 13 ) baseline visit one man one woman age group day . The size heal wound document visit 3 ( 4-6 day visit 2 ) take photograph wound millimeter ( mm ) tape measure place next wound . Senescent cell visualize confocal microscopy base number senescent marker describe literature . Senescent biomarkers measure tissue systemically baseline follow-up . Medical Relevance Expected Outcome : Cellular senescence complex process characterize arrest replication think intrinsically connect age age-related disease . Recently , researcher suggest senescent cell may play role pathogenesis type 2 diabetes associated complication . Therefore , understand physiological role senescent cell critically important understand age age-related disease type 2 diabetes . Preclinical data show senescent cell inducible cutaneous wound healing . Therefore , method use quantify senescent cell response standard stimulus verify whether magnitude senescence response correlate age . In future method could use test intervention modify senescence response , may invaluable method assess novel treatment type 2 diabetes involve senescent cell .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age 20 39 year age 70 year old Healthy ( see exclusion criterion ) Are able understand study risk procedure , consent participate study . Are able read speak English . EXCLUSION CRITERIA ( SCREENING VISIT ) : A medical condition require use chronic anticoagulant medication use warfarin , clopidogrel , heparin antiplatelet agent low dose aspirin ( 81mg ) . History increase bleeding due either know medical condition undiagnosed cause . A medical condition cause impair wound heal diabetes . Current androgenic/anabolic and/or corticosteroid use use within 90 day procedure ( ocular corticosteroid use okay ) . Active infection chronic skin condition would prevent access biopsy area . Taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent ( NSAIDs ) Motrin ( Ibuprofen ) , Advil ( Ibuprofen ) Naprosyn ( Naproxen ) participant unable stop take 4 day first biopsy 3 day final biopsy procedure . Taking 81 mg aspirin day participant unable stop take 4 day first biopsy 3 day final biopsy procedure . Allergic Lidocaine ( Xylocaine ) local anesthetic participant past severe allergic reaction similar drug . Allergic topical betadine solution . Severe allergy adhesive find tape . HIV virus infection . Hepatitis B C exposure within 6 month visit . History diabetes ( require medical treatment diet exercise ) fasting plasma glucose great equal 126 mg/dL HbA1c great equal 6.5 % . Clinically significant hormonal dysfunction ( selfreported laboratory value range . Mild hypothyroidism ( TSH &lt; 10 microIU/mL ) participants 60 consider exclusion ) . Kidney disease ( Creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl calculate creatinine clearance &lt; 50 cc/min ) Liver disease ( Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 mg/dl ( unless high level ascribe Gilbert disease ) ; ALT , AST alkaline phosphatase twice normal serum concentration ) Severe gastrointestinal disease Crohn disease ulcerative colitis require continuous treatment . History severe pulmonary disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) asthma require continuous medication use . History severe psychiatric condition associate behavioral problem require chronic medical treatment . Currently pregnant breastfeeding . Participants history skin keloid formation wound heal Current illness judge study physician substantially increase risk associate skin biopsy ( ) ( active infection , allergy , etc . ) .</criteria>
