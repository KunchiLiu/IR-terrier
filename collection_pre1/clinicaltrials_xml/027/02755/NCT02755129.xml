	<detailed_description>Frailty geriatric syndrome characterize reduce homeostatic reserve , expose organism extreme vulnerability endogenous exogenous stressor . Frailty prevalent old people involve progressive physiological decline multiple body system , typical sign symptom include weight loss , fatigue , muscle weakness , slow unsteady gait decline activity . Frailty increasingly recognize important prognostic indicator heart failure ( HF ) prevalent HF general population . The identification frailty early stage important intervention may potentially prevent , delay clinical consequence frailty . Of particular focus study walk speed prior research demonstrate slow gait speed strong prognostic ability traditional component use assess frailty , report one strong predict adverse outcome , mobility disability , fall , hospitalization . Also interest detection posture change may implications detect change sleep habit could also provide context biomarker signal collect LINQ device . The literature review scientific soundness propose analytical technique evaluate . The rationale study design evaluate feasibility use Reveal LINQ™ monitoring walk pattern . HF patient ( target population study discussion ) would make possible test sensitivity accelerometer embed LINQ device small cohort subject reduce mobility frailty prevalent general population , well recognize important prognostic indicator . No risk subject expect study .</detailed_description>
