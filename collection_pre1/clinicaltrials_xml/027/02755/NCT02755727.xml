	<brief_summary>Chronic Lateral Epicondylar Tendinopathy debilitate condition associate repetitive use forearm extensor muscle . Though often self-limiting nature proportion patient fail respond conservative treatment rest , activity modification , physiotherapy use brace . Though previously common treatment modality steroid injection show detrimental long term . Present practice offer patient respond conservative treatment surgical debridement . Though often effective invasive procedure . Platelet rich plasma injection may offer viable alternative chronic case however systematic evidence efficacy . Methods 12 patient , diagnose chronic lateral epicondylar tendinopathy , randomly assign receive either open surgical debridement platelet rich plasma injection . Following treatment , follow interval 6 week 3 , 6 12 month . The outcome treatment assess use validated outcome score measure specifically design upper limb pathology . The result pilot study use construct large randomise control trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet Rich Plasma v Open Surgery Treatment Tennis Elbow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Question There difference patient report outcome measure open surgical release platelet rich plasma injection treatment chronic lateral epicondylar tendinopathy ( Tennis Elbow ) . Aims - To estimate distribution patient-reported outcome measure ( PROMS ) 6 week , 3 month , 6 month 1 year - To record adverse event associate either treatment - To test feasibility study design preparation large randomise trial - To collect data allow power calculation large randomise trial - To use data large grant application Objectives - To randomise patient fail conservative management tennis elbow one two treatment method : Platelet Rich Plasma Open Surgical Release - To collect treatment outcome data form visual analogue scale , Oxford Elbow Score DASH ( Disability Arm , Shoulder Hand ) score - To use current best guidance administer leucocyte-rich PRP ( L-PRP ) ultrasound guidance - To use data gain pilot study assess viability large randomise control trial Research design This pilot study conduct randomise control pilot trial Royal Devon Exeter Hospital , UK . Patient Selection Patients select attend outpatient elbow clinic Royal Devon Exeter Hospital . All patient review Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon specialise Elbow surgery . The inclusion criterion patient experience 6 month symptom tennis elbow , include pain lateral elbow radiate forearm , point tenderness origin extensor muscle close proximity ( within 2.5cm ) pain resist extension Wrist . Patients must also fail conservative treatment ( course physiotherapy activity modification ) baseline elbow pain &gt; 3/10 VAS resist elbow extension . Patients exclude : presence full tendon tear pre-intervention ultrasound , unfit surgical intervention , undergone previous elbow surgery , previously undergone PRP injection therapy , systemic autoimmune rheumatological disease , receive immunosuppressive treatment , receive local steroid injection within 3 month randomization unable comply follow-up . Intervention The 2 arm trial include PRP therapy Open surgical debridement - Platelet Rich Plasma injection - Open Surgical Release ( presently standard treatment regimen ) Both group patient give identical physiotherapy programme followed-up identical timeframes record outcomes intervention . Sample size The present proposal intend pilot study . As intention randomise 6 patient arm trial , 12 patient total . It estimate 1 suitable patient likely see outpatient clinic week . Owing attrition patient suitability hop 6 month enrolment period yield 12 patient . Randomisation The participate patient randomise 1:1 allocation open surgery PRP injection . The randomisation administer central independent randomisation service , provide medical secretary use computer-generated randomisation sequence seal sequentially numbered envelope , completely independent trial . Outcome score Primary outcome measure form Patient Reported Outcome Measures ( PROMS ) Range Motion ( ROM ) Primary Outcome : Change Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation ( PRTEE ) pre-intervention 3 month post-intervention - patient compile questionnaire base specific elbow symptom Tennis Elbow All secondary outcome measure complete pre-operatively 6 week , 3 month , 6 month 12 month . ‚óè PROMS Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) - Using linear scale 10cms length . Assessed change score time . Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand ( quickDASH ) - patient compile questionnaire base subjective assessment symptom ability perform activity daily live last week . Oxford Elbow Score ( OES ) - patient compile questionnaire base specific elbow symptom related activity daily live past 4 week . Adverse event - peri-procedural , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month 12 month</detailed_description>
