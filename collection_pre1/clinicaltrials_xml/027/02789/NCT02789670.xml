	<brief_summary>New therapeutic approach MS emerge , target different actor immune system . Some target specific population white blood cell : B lymphocytes compose different subpopulation . The subset B cell express different functional property control immune response , regulation mechanism yet clearly describe . Some subpopulation could amplify inflammation IL-6 production example , whereas one contribute regulation production IL-10 . Using sample collect large cohort individual risk MS treatment-naive patient early onset disease , investigator aim develop 2 year follow-up study different blood B cell subset distribution functional property term pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine production MS . This approach identify new biomarkers monitor MS patient lead good define indication use depletive B cell drug counteract regulatory action cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Distribution Regulatory B Cells Blood Multiple Sclerosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) progressive immuno-inflammatory degenerative disease central nervous system ( CNS ) represent second common cause disability young people . The pathophysiologic mechanism involve complex effective therapeutic strategy yet define . Moreover 's today evident treatment approach perform personalized point view . In context , biomarkers evaluate course disease also predict efficacy therapy particularly need MS . Recent data underline direct role B-cells MS . Such comprehensive data lead new therapeutic strategy use biotherapies order deplete , modulate , function peripheral B cell . Such approach lead contradictory result efficacy . Today , remain unclear whether B-cells exert diminish regulatory effect instead potentiate pathogenic response T-cells . Such dual property may depend release inhibitory ( e.g . interleukin-10 ) pro-inflammatory cytokine ( e.g . interleukin-6 ) and/or direct interaction cell , especially T cell . The investigator aim longitudinally evaluate quantitative functional change peripheral blood B-cell subset ( 1 ) initiation phase MS , i.e . radiological isolated syndrome ( RIS ) clinically isolated syndrome ( CIS ) ( 2 ) progression MS ( 3 ) two clinical form MS naïve treatment patient : Relapsing-Remittent MS ( RRMS ) Primary Progressive MS ( PPMS ) . B-cell subset define combination membrane marker enumerate different time point ( inclusion ( treatment ) 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 month treatment initiation ) whole blood flow cytometric ( FCM ) analysis . The absolute count relative proportion transitional , naïve , memory , marginal zone-like B-cell subset follow prospectively patient radiologically isolated syndrome ( RIS , n= 20 ) , clinically isolated syndrome ( CIS , n= 20 ) , MS patient relapse remit form ( RRMS , n = 20 ) MS patient primary progressive evolution disease ( PPMS , n = 20 ) . Control sample collect patient affect inflammatory disease neurological symptom ( Devic syndrome , Neurobehcet , neurosarcoidosis n = 20 ) without neurological symptom ( systemic sclerosis , SSc , n= 20 ) blood donor ( n = 40 ) . In order evaluate functional property B cell , peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) group patient activate CD40 ligand CpG Oligodeoxynucleotides ( CpG ODNs ) , IL-10-producing B-cells enumerate FCM brief incubation phorbol myristate acetate , ionomycin , brefeldin A protein transport inhibitor agent . In select CIS MS patient whose change B-cell subpopulation associate onset progression disease representative , B-cell subpopulation purify activated CD40 ligand CpG ODNs co culture anti-CD3-activated autologous T-cells evaluate inhibitory potentiate effect T-cell production pro-inflammatory cytokine ( e.g . IFN-gamma , IL-17 ) . All phenotypic analyse cell culture perform use previously validate protocol . Our ultimate goal correlate quantitative functional change subset compose systemic B-cell population grade evolution MS . Such strategy could lead identify MS patient receive treatment target B cell . Further , may offer rationale alternative form cell therapy could introduce example autologous purify B regulator cell depletive strategy .</detailed_description>
