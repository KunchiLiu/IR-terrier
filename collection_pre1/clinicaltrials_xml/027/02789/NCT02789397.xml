	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Assess Efficacy Rituximab Azathioprine Treatment Granulomatous Lymphocytic Interstitial Lung Disease ( GLILD ) Adult Patients With Common Variable Immunodeficiency ( CVID )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Common Variable Immunodeficiency ( CVID ) one clinically important primary immunodeficiency due frequency , serious complication , long-term cost therapy . A form lung disease know granulomatous lymphocytic interstitial lung disease ( GLILD ) occur 10-15 % patient CVID . The cause GLILD unknown ; long-term study define natural course GLILD ; clinical trial do define best possible treatment condition . As result , currently prove standard care treatment GLILD . The best treatment individual GLILD currently know . Some doctor believe GLILD always continue get bad patient treat unless happens . Other doctor believe GLILD always progressive treat early prevent problem later . There compel evidence support treatment use rituximab ( RTX ) conjunction azathioprine ( AZA ) , may improve lung function abnormality see high resolution CT ( HRCT ) scan chest . STUDY GROUPS Patients study either receive placebo combination Rituximab azathioprine . These drug approve US Food Drug Administration condition , yet disease . Because one know treatment best , patient `` randomize '' one two study group . Randomization mean put group chance . TREATMENT Eligible patient randomize receive either 18 month Rituximab Azathioprine ( 20 patient ) placebo ( 20 patient ) . Rituximab administer intravenously ( IV ) weekly four consecutive week enrollment month 6 12 . IV placebo administer schedule Rituximab . Azathioprine oral placebo administer mouth daily 18 month . SUMMARY OF STUDY PROCEDURES -Month 1 , 6 , 12 Patients require travel study site weekly four consecutive week enrollment 6 12 month receive study infusion . At visit , patient give : - Your study infusion - Physical exam vital sign - Blood test check organ function Every six month ( Enrollment , 6 , 12 &amp; 18 month ) receive study treatment , patient ask complete follow study test : - Lung Function test - High resolution CT chest - Quality Life Questionnaire , 6-min walk distance test Karnofsky performance scale . - Blood research - approximately 10 teaspoon blood collect Monthly Labs Following first month study treatment , patient require visit local clinic/hospital blood draw monitor lab value twice monthly second third month treatment , monthly . Final Study Visit The final study visit take place Month 24 start study treatment . Patients also follow test do : - Physical exam vital sign - Lung Function test - High resolution CT chest - Quality Life Questionnaire , 6-min walk distance test Karnofsky performance scale . - Blood research - approximately 10 teaspoon blood collect</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age : Patients must 18 year age old . Diagnosis : Diagnosis CVID accordance international criterion include : A ) Serum IgG least 2 standard deviation age adjust norm ; B ) Decreased serum IgA and/or IgM ; C ) Age &gt; 4 year . ; D ) Abnormal specific antibody production response immunization ; E ) Exclusion secondary cause hypogammaglobulinemia . Diagnosis GLILD base histopathologic abnormality lung tissue obtain open lung biopsy within 12 month enrollment confirm Pathology Core . Performance Level : Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥ 50 % Prior Therapy : Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior therapy . Systemic steroid need complete least 60 day time enrollment . Organ Function : Adequate Lung Function define : • FVC &gt; 60 % predict • DLco &gt; 35 % predicted Adequate Bone Marrow Function define : • Peripheral absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 750/mm3 • Platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm3 Adequate Hepatic Function evidence : Direct Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) age SGPT ( ALT ) &lt; 135 U/L . For purpose study , ULN SGPT 45 U/L . Adequate Renal Function define normal serum creatinine Reproductive Function : Female patient childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test confirm prior enrollment . Female patient infant must agree breastfeed infant study . Male female patient childbearing potential must agree use effective method contraception approve investigator study . Sexually active female childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( diaphragm , birth control pill , injection , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , surgical sterilization , subcutaneous implant , abstinence , etc . ) duration treatment 6 month last dose study therapy . Sexually active men must agree use barrier contraceptive duration treatment 6 month last dose study therapy . Regulatory Requirements All patient must sign write informed consent . All institutional , FDA , NIH requirement human study must meet . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Infection : Patients uncontrolled infection eligible . Patients document serious infection within 3 month screen opportunistic infection within 6 month screen eligible . Cardiac Function : Patients diagnose NYHA Class III IV congestive heart failure , ventricular arrhythmia , uncontrolled hypertension . Allergies : Known hypersensitivity component RTX AZA . Current Therapy : Systemic immunosuppressive medication include steroid . Steroids use prevent treat infusionrelated RTX symptom , use prior immediately RTX infusion , continue beyond 3 day . The use systemic steroid record . Inhaled steroid acceptable . Previous Therapy : Previous treatment RTX AZA GLILD . Pregnant Females : Pregnant female allow participate study . Hepatic Disease : Known cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension . Hepatitis B Hepatitis C Infection : All patient screen Hepatitis B C PCR . Hepatitis C positive determine PCR . Hepatitis B Reactivation : Hepatitis B Reactivation define Hepatitis B carrier patient one follow : Positive HBeAg Quantitative HBV Viral DNA Load &gt; 105 genomes/ml HIV 1 Positive : HIV 1 infection determine PCR . Homozygous Mutations : Patients homozygous mutation thiopurine methyltransferase ( TPMT ) exclude study .</criteria>
