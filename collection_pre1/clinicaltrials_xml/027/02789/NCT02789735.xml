	<detailed_description>A prospective double-blinded randomise control trial perform baseline assessment 7-10 month childbirth follow-up directly 6 month treatment period low level laser therapy ( LLLT ) sham laser treatment , give 12 planned treatment session four week . A total 60 woman sample consecutively . Women eligible participate woman register maternal health care unit municipality Sundsvall Timrå subsequent childbirth register Sundsvall-Härnösand County Hospital , Sweden . An invitation letter prepay response envelope send postal mail eligible woman contact information retrieve labour ward . Women respond enrol approve participation sign informed consent . The woman include study accord inclusion exclusion criterion follow baseline assessment comprise urinary test , questionnaires clinical examination . After inclusion blood sample , serum plasma , drawn inclusion directly treatment period . Randomisation blind The randomisation sequence generate statistician involved study . Randomisation do use block randomisation ( block size 4 6 ) without stratification . The investigator use sequentially number , opaque , seal envelope pre-prepared advance statistician . Women fulfil inclusion criterion randomise active laser treatment sham laser treatment . A research assistant involve inclusion assessment perform randomisation , prepare handle allocate treatment device treatment session . The treatment give physiotherapist blind treatment group , woman 's case history , questionnaires clinical examination . All collect data handle , store analysed Department Public Health Caring Sciences Uppsala University . The analyst blind treatment allocation data primary outcome analyse conclusion drawn sign write code broken . Questionnaires At baseline , woman complete questionnaire include question socio-demographic data , somatic mental health , gynaecological obstetric history , lifestyle . At baseline follow-up , woman report present pain distribution pain drawing ( include onset modality pain ) . Pain intensity present bad past week measure 100 mm VAS ( Visual analogue scale ) . Functioning assessed Disability Rating Index ( DRI ) , Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire ( PGQ ) Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ) . Throughout treatment period , woman daily record pain intensity pain diary use 100 mm VAS . At follow-up treatment period woman complete Global Perceived Effect scale , report adverse event , report opinion whether receive active treatment . Clinical examination The two assessor , gynaecologist physiotherapist , perform examination without knowledge assign treatment , woman 's case history , questionnaire reply clinical examination . The test procedure test sequence throughout study . A gynaecologic examination , include ultrasound examination , perform gynaecologist baseline . Provoked pain gentle pressure follow 13 predetermined intra-pelvic anatomical landmark assess via vaginal palpation : coccyx , lateral part sacrum insertion sacrospinous ligament , middle part sacrospinous ligament , insertion sacrospinous ligament ischiadic spine , ischium inferior ilio-ischial fusion lateral medial part pubic bone . All structure examine bilaterally except coccyx . The musculoskeletal examination baseline follow-up perform physiotherapist . It include examination lower back spine , pelvis assessment physical functioning . Briefly , low back spine examine palpation ligament paravertebral muscle , Kemp 's foramina test , Valsalva test , SLR ( straight leg raise test ) test tendon reflex sensibility . The pelvis examine follow test : P4 test , Menell 's test , Patrick 's fab test , modify Trendelenburg test pubic symphysis palpation test . Pain provocation test consider positive duplicate aggravate pain sacral area test side , otherwise negative . The woman grade provoke pain 100 mm VAS scale . Physical functioning assessed baseline follow-up Six Minute Walk Test ( 6MWT ) , Timed Up Go Test ( TUGT ) , Active Straight Leg Raising Test ( ASLR ) isometric trunk muscle test . Urine blood sample A urinary test sample test hCG , human Chorionic Gonadotropin ( pregnancy ) , time inclusion . A blood sample , serum plasma , drawn inclusion directly treatment period . The blood sample analyse directly estrogen , progesterone , testosterone , sexual binding globulin , thyroid stimulate hormone prolactin thereafter discard . Treatment regimen The treatment comprise 12 treatment session distribute one treatment daily three consecutive day first treatment week three time week every weekday next three week . The treatment give licensed physiotherapist blind allocated treatment . The treatment start immediately menstrual period within one week 's time among woman regain menstrual period , otherwise time convenient . Throughout treatment period woman ask avoid pain provoking activity , use corticosteroid treatment , sexual intercourse without use safe contraception . Before treatment woman sign form state unprotected intercourse since last treatment session . The woman report use pain medication physical activity end treatment period . Treatment equipment performance A class IV low level laser ( LiteCure LCT-1000® ) similar sham laser use . Both device deliver LiteCure , LLC , Newark , DE , USA . The active device delivers energy two wavelength , 20 % beam 810 nm ( nanometer ) 80 % beam 980 nm . Energy give test start study every month , use Thor labs power meter PM100D photo sensor S 121 C , make sure device work correctly . There also red aim beam wavelength 650 nm power 5 mW ( milliwatt ) . The sham laser delivers solely aim beam . The treatment apply sacral region standard laser probe 26 mm quart ball top , internal pelvis 16 cm long fibre-containing transvaginal probe diameter bulb-shaped end 18 mm . The physical therapist participant use safety eyewear treatment session treatment administration area close , restrict access reflective surface . During treatment sacral point , standard probe move 1 cm/second start point end-point repeatedly treatment time , bilaterally . The standard probe hold perpendicular body surface press skin . During treatment vaginally physiotherapist palpates anatomical landmark vaginal palpation guide transvaginal probe hold still treatment site . Due reason hygiene transvaginal probe cover transparent plastic cover treatment . The plastic cover discard probe clean ethanol-based surface disinfection treatment . Treatment location outside pelvis The treatment outside pelvis give three site define give start point treatment area . The start point treatment describe vertical horizontal coordinate . Treatment location inside pelvis The treatment sit inside pelvis : 1. sacrospinous ligament insertion ischial spine 2. middle sacrospinous ligament 3. sacrospinous ligament insertion sacrum medially level ischial spine Treatment dose To deliver appropriate dose energy accord best available evidence experience , active treatment group receive LLLT dual wavelength 810 nm 980 nm dose 10 J/cm² vaginally 10 J/cm² sacral area . The control group receive sham treatment red aiming beam power 5 mW treatment time active treatment . If woman experience negative reaction tolerate treatment dose , treatment immediately stop . The amount energy give treatment session record . Data analysis Power calculation To show statistically significant difference least 20 mm pain intensity ( consider clinically relevant difference ) measure visual analogue scale active treatment group control group , least 32 woman need assumption type I error 5 % type II error 20 % . To take account data loss investigator aim sample size least 30 woman group , total 60 woman . Statistical analysis The analysis outcomes perform accordance European Medicines Agency 's Statistical Principles Clinical Trials guideline . Differences treatment group regard outcome measure analyse regression analysis variance rank . Other parametric non-parametric statistical method use whenever appropriate . Two-sided test use 5 % statistical significance level choose analysis . To provide unbiased comparison group investigator perform intention-to-treat analysis . Also , per-protocol analysis woman complete study accord protocol perform . Ethical consideration The use LLLT device approve Swedish European authority ( Reference number 2014/188 , dated140811 ) suppose minimal side effect . The present study approve Regional Ethical Review Board Uppsala ( Dnr 2014 / 188 ) . All woman sign informed consent . To prevent potential injury harm , vaginal probe use care . Also , gynaecologic examination perform start study treatment . The effect low level laser irradiation early pregnancy know ; therefore potential harm seek minimised test hCG study inclusion . Also write statement sexual intercourse without safe contraception give treatment session . The physical therapist participant use safety eyewear treatment session treatment administration area close , restrict access without reflective surface . Finally , perception advantage study treatment outweigh ethical problem . All researcher declare conflict interest .</detailed_description>
