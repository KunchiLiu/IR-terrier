	<brief_title>Comparing Modified Wet Suction Technique Dry Suction Technique EUS-FNA Solid Occupying Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients divide two group , arm A arm B accord two different method adopt first needle , refers modify wet suction technique 5ml dry suction technique.Take solid occupy lesion diagnosis accuracy research major indicator compare modify wet suction technique 5ml dry suction technique optimal efficiency test . Take classⅠerror , a=0.05 , class II error , β=0.2 , power=0.8 , suppose diagnostic accuracy dry suction technique solid occupy lesion 75 % , diagnostic accuracy modify wet suction technique solid occupy lesion 85 % , minimum sample size 248 patient 5ml dry suction technique 248 patient modify wet suction technique , 2x2 cross-over design adopt , namely , arm 124 patient respectively . Considering factor include defluxion , 20 % case add two arm , therefore , arm 148 patient respectively , total number patient 296 . The statistic expert generate randomized serial numbers（001-296）according same-size allocation ratio arm A arm B Statistical Analysis System 9.2 ( SAS 9.2 ) , statistical software randomize block method . The serial number randomize group number trial patient , block capacity 8 , totally 37 randomized block . One copy send trial center patient allocating , another copy save trial applicant unit . Every trail center responsible screen qualified patient , rank visit time get randomize group number determine go arm A arm B .The research people patient trial center know randomize grouping number relevant arm . The arm name seal scratch card . Every trial patient get unique randomize number , change whole trial . Use inclusion exclusion criterion observe patient relative inspection , confirm patient qualified trial . Record result last time test treatment . Although good get inform consent kind observation test , reason , medical imaging examination complete , long image examination do within 3 week needle biopsy , still collect baseline data ( image examination do hospital , trial center issue new evaluation report 1 week patient join trial group ) ; lab test item do 2 week needle biopsy still collect baseline data pre-research use , test do trail center hospital guarantee data trace ability . The investigator puncture lesion four needle pass : For Arm A,5ml dry suction technique adopt first needle , modify wet suction technique/5ml dry suction technique/modified wet suction technique operate successively ; For Arm B , modify wet suction technique adopt first needle , 5ml dry suction technique/ modify wet suction technique /5ml dry suction technique operate successively.Well , 5ml dry suction technique conduct follow : needle puncture lesion ultrasound scanning , remove stylet connect needle syringe 5ml negative pressure aspiration , needle move to-and-fro within lesion 20 time . Suction release needle withdrawn lesion.And modify wet suction technique conduct follow : needle whose stylet pull flush 2ml saline solution puncture lesion find , puncture lesion replace syringe 5ml negative pressure aspiration , needle move to-and-fro within lesion 20 time . Suction release needle withdrawn lesion.If core tissue obtain operator determine insufficient specimen accord Macroscopic rapid on-site ( MOSE ) operation , remedy procedure do , punctuation process continue appropriate punctuation method satisfactory specimen obtained.Experts cytology pathology evaluate specimen quality make diagnosis condition know punctuation method . The evaluation diagnosis specimen make two expert independently . If two expert hold different opinion , make conclusion full discussion . If two cytological smear punctuation method , highest-rate smear take standard smear.Follow ( outpatient follow telephone follow ) patient 1 week , 12 week 36 week needle biopsy collect patient clinical data confirm final diagnosis . Case Report Form ( CRF ) fill researcher , every involved patient must CRF fill . This audited clinical monitor hand data administrator input manage data , first copy keep applicant , second copy go trial center , third copy keep trail researchers.The data input management take care specially assign person . In order guarantee data accuracy , data input do twice two independent data administrator , computerize manual verifying , hand data statistical expert blind check statistic analyzing.For question doubt within case report form , data administrator make DRQ via clinical monitor ask researcher . The researcher answer fee back soon possible . According researcher answer , data administrator data modifying , confirm inputting , necessary send DRQ again.After blind audition confirm establish data base correct , major researcher , applicant statistic analyze people lock data . The locked data change , data base hand statistical analyzer statistic analyze accord statistic analyzing plan . Problems find data lock modify statistic analyze procedure.This do specialize statistic analyze people accord predetermine statistic analyzing plan . The statistic analyze carry accord intention principle confirm full analysis set per-protocol set principle . After complete statistic analyzing , statistic analyzer issue statistic analysis report send major researcher write study report . Statistic analyzing plan : （1）General principle①All statistical test two-sided . P &lt; 0.05 regarded difference statistical significance.② Description quantitative index calculate mean criterion deviation , description classification index describe number percentage type.（2） Statistical Analysis Method：① For measurement data , compare data baseline value screen period , adopt deviation t-test , variance analysis cross-over experiment rank-sum test cross-over experiment make comparison data baseline value.② For enumeration data , adopt pair x2-test ( include CMH-x2 test ) Fisher 's exact test compare data group.（3）Defluxion Analysis：The total defluxion rate group defluxion rate cause adverse event compare x2-test Fisher 's exact test.（4）Analysis baseline value balance：The index baseline value demographic data , vital sign , history disease basic treatment compare group t-test x2 test measure balance group . Baseline evaluation make full analysis set ( FAS ) per-protocol set ( PPS ) .（5）Validity Analysis：The primary index validity analysis diagnostic accuracy 5ml dry pressure modify wet pressure solid space-occupying lesion . The secondary index validity analysis include punctuation specimen quality 5ml dry pressure modify wet pressure , diagnostic rate first needle 5ml dry pressure / modify wet pressure incidence complication modify wet pressure 5ml dry pressure . The rate two arm Youden index compare approximate normal z-test central-effect-considered Cochran Mantel Haenszel-x2 ( CMH-x2 ) text . ( 6 ) Safety Analysis : The incidence adverse events/ adverse reaction ( include complication punctuation ) arm compare x2-test Fisher 's exact test describe adverse event occur experiment list normal/abnormal change laboratory text result test relationship abnormal change laboratory text result diagnostic research . ( 7 ) All statistical analysis complete professional statistical analysis software , SAS version 9.2 .</detailed_description>
