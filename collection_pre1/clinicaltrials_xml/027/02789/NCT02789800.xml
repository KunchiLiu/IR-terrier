	<detailed_description>A recent systematic review prevalence Multimorbidity ( MM ) recommend count 3+ chronic disease , focus single chronic disease particular . This definition identify vulnerable population high need , low income poverty , poor outcome challenge process care . It include people wide array complexity uncomplicated course minimally interact chronic disease highly complex MM patient . MM important due burden patient , account high utilization . The definition represent continuum vulnerability many opportunity prevention management . Despite high prevalence MM , research health care still base single disease paradigm may appropriate 45 % primary care patient MM . A recent Cochrane systematic review impact intervention patient MM identify paucity study internationally mixed result , thus pave way work Team . The promising intervention , date , enhance teamwork multifaceted intervention involve multiple professional . Patient-Centred Partnerships Patients Providers : The definition patient-centred partnership derive Canadian policy report : `` collaboration inform , respect patient healthcare team . '' There internationally accept comprehensive operational definition four component guide many aspect propose research program : first , explore patient ' disease illness experience ; second , understanding whole person context ; third , finding common ground ; fourth , enhance patient-provider relationship . There empirical evidence impact patient-centred partnership well patient outcome low cost . Systematic review intervention indicate promising result feasible practice-based intervention target provider patient . Canadian policy report define second facet patient-centredness , `` seamless coordination integration care . '' Transitions require coordination key feature care patient MM . Coordination show positively impact : symptom relief ; social functioning ; hospital re-admission related cost . Papers review Team identify promise type intervention structure delivery system re-design . STUDY # 2.1 Qualitative Evaluation align Programs Purpose : The study : ass transform program performs ; distinguish component intervention ; identify contextual factor may influence content effectiveness intervention . It also examine local barrier facilitator well transition coordination care . Methods design : The Team conduct qualitative evaluation transform program explain various contexts influence observe effect [ 1 ] include context health care system province . A recent example research approach Canada Best et al , 2012 [ 2 ] . Data obtain interview write document . In-depth interview conduct among four category stakeholder . This include : ) decision-makers ( n = 10 ) ; b ) primary care physician ( n = 10 ) ; c ) professional intervention ( n = 10 ) ; ) purposive sample patient multimorbidity ( n = 10 ) informal caregiver ( n=10 ) [ 51 ] . The number interview estimate guide saturation data [ 3 ] . Data collection : In-depth interview , last 30 60 minute ensure complete detailed participation . The data collection hold second year transform program . The interview guide examine context variable influence effect element could potentially inform development future intervention . All interview audiotaped transcribed verbatim . Additionally , write document collect ( program team meeting summary , sample 10 medical record research record participate site , checklist describe fidelity intervention , document produce specifically intervention ) provide in-depth understand various contexts intervention occur . Data analysis : The data analyze use iterative interpretative approach [ 4 ] . The data participant examine independent team analysis occur concurrent manner build develop emerge theme . A cod template develop edited new theme emerge others reclassify discard . The data management software NVivo 9.0 [ QSR Int . USA ] use organize coded data identify exemplar quote reflect central theme . All write document undergo content analysis use NVivo 9.0 . The final step analysis triangulation synthesis theme stakeholder participant content analysis document . [ 3-4 ] STUDY # 2.2 : Evaluation effect align Programs Setting : The consent participate site describe study 2.1 . The method present one setting duplicate second setting . Patients refer receive service program provider . The intervention investigator test aligned program . Patients refer program new patient never expose intervention . In addition main reason referral program , referral form also include eligibility detail evaluation , include diagnosis . Patient sample : Patients recruit study cognitively intact literate age 18 80 year age . The upper limit 80 year avoid recruiting patient risk institutionalized dependent follow-up . Patients present least three chronic condition . Methods Design : Patients agree participate complete questionnaire baseline ( T1 ) collect sociodemographic data baseline measure , use document equivalence group ( group define ) . Effectiveness align program assess use three strategy . 1 . To measure short-term effect ( 4 month ) , randomize control trial ( RCT ) design delay intervention use [ 5 ] . Eligible patient randomize consent receive either intervention within short period time ( Group A ) 4 month later ( Group B ) ; self-reported mail questionnaire complete baseline ( T1 ) patient participant , 4 month end intervention group A ( T2 ) 4 month baseline control group B ( T2 ) . This constitute short-term measure effectiveness intervention . Group B receive intervention . 2 . To measure mid-term effect ( one year ) patient-reported outcome , study propose combine group A B together . The patient complete questionnaire 12 month end intervention ( T3 ) . 3 . To measure mid-term ( T3 ) long-term effect ( T4 2 year ) health service utilization cost , patient ( group A B ) provide consent give access health administrative ( HA ) data . At baseline , control Group C constitute use anonymized HA data . Patients match gender , age , region main three diagnosis . The Team build algorithms match every set control . Groups A B together compare propensity match control group C before-after study use administrative ( HA ) data . Variables outcome measure : The variable fall 5 category : sociodemographic ; PC context ; main co-variables interest ; primary outcome ; secondary outcome . Socio-demographic characteristic include gender , age , education , family income , marital status , occupation , housing number person live roof . Context variables refer type PC organization intervention occur ( Family Medicine Group ) . The three main co-variables interest Team 's three innovation : self-reported multimorbidity ( measured Disease Burden Morbidity Assessment [ 6 ] ; patient-centred partnership ( Patient Perception Patient-Centredness Scale [ 7-9 ] ) ; Patient center coordination ( Patient Perceptions Transitions care , adapt investigator Coleman [ 10 ] ) . The two primary outcome measure Health Education Impact Questionnaire ( HeiQ ) provide broad profile potential impact patient education intervention [ 11 ] level perceive disease-management self-efficacy use 6-item Self-Efficacy Managing Chronic Disease ( SEM-CD ) [ 12 ] . Secondary patient perceive outcomes VR-12 measure health status EQ5D measure Quality Life [ 13 ] . The Kessler psychological distress scale K-6 measure psychological distress [ 14 ] . The investigator also use questionnaire health behavior [ 15 ] . Finally , HA data also use secondary outcome compare health care utilization cost intervention . HA data include emergency department visit , avoidable hospital admission , readmission , time first primary care visit emergency department visit continuity care . Data analysis : Investigators first describe participant ' baseline characteristic group compare among group . To evaluate short-term effect , Groups A B compare T2 score analysis co-variance ( ANCOVA ) adjust T1 score [ 16 ] . To document mid-term effect , measure analysis variance use study evolution continuous variable collect 3 time [ 17 ] . Sub-analyses gender perform . Health system cost intervention control group evaluate use amount pay provider base provincial fee schedule cost-weighted utilization institution include hospital long-term care . Utilization record obtain HA data multiply applicable cost weight ( e.g . CIHI Resource Intensity Weights - RIWs ) use CIHI cost per weighted case [ 18 ] The method employ model individual patient-level cost incur health system , use method develop cost use administrative data [ 19 ] . Incremental resource intervention group identify cost use applicable time/resource input relevant wage rate follow guideline economic evaluation health intervention [ 20 ] .</detailed_description>
