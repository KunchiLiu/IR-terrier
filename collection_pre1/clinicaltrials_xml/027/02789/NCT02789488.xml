	<brief_summary>Poly cystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) disease prevalent woman reproductive age face obesity along increase risk type-2 diabetes high cholesterol level . The genetically determine cause PCOS include disturbed level insulin androgen . Standardized fenugreek seed extract ( Furocyst ) contain compound saponins &amp; flavonoid act insulin indirectly help regulate androgen level body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovary syndrome consider clinical public health consequence involve increase number cyst woman reproductive age . These cyst under-developed sac egg develop . In PCOS , sac unable release egg mean ovulation n't take place . The estimated 5-10 % prevalence PCOS report woman reproductive age . A study Spain also report 28.3 % prevalence rate PCOS among 113 overweight obese woman refer endocrinology clinic weight loss . This data compare previously report prevalence 6.5 % suggest prevalence PCOS might markedly increase obesity . PCOS impact significantly various hormonal cycle . With PCOS , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) level become high follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level . Because increase LH level , LH surge take place ovulation n't carry result irregular menstrual cycle . The irregular menstrual period produce oligomenorrhea ( menstrual period ) amenorrhea ( menstrual period ) infertility due irregular lack ovulation . PCOS also produce high level masculinize hormone symptom acne hirsutism , hypermenorrhea involve heavy prolong menstrual period androgenic alopecia ( increase hair thin diffused hair loss ) . The metabolic syndrome associate PCOS increase risk type 2 diabetes , high cholesterol level obesity . These complication arise genetically determine cause PCOS i.e . hyper- secretion androgen ovary favour excess luteinizing hormone ( LH ) secretion insulin resistance . However , insulin resistance without genetic mutation may initiator , follow hyper-androgenism . Thus , insulin resistance important contribute factor abnormal steroidogenesis PCOS hyper-insulinemia stimulate pathway insulin like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) theca cell ovary cross-reacting receptor IGF . Stimulation ovarian theca cell increase production androgen ( eg , testosterone , androstenedione ) turn , block down-regulation androgen LH surge lead hyper-androgenic environment ovary . Because decreased level FSH relative LH , ovarian granulosa cell aromatize androgen estrogen , lead decrease estrogen level result anovulation . Treatments PCOS choose base woman 's symptom , age future pregnancy plan may include birth control pill regulate menstruation , insulin-sensitizing medication , ovulation induction treat infertility , androgen-blocking medication , topical anti-hair-growth medication , etc . Standardized fenugreek ( Trigonella foenum graecum ) seed extract ( Furocyst ) play important role management PCOS . It improve glucose-tolerance insulin-sensitivity , thereby promote weight loss moderation androgen level blood . Standardized fenugreek seed extract contains group furostanolic saponin , derive fenugreek seed innovative process . It contain rich variety saponin flavonoid know low blood lipid level play valuable role improve insulin sensitivity . Standardized fenugreek seed extract dual insulin-sensitizer . In presence high fiber furostanolic saponin , cell become sensitive insulin &amp; increase number insulin receptor sit occurs . These receptor sit responsive insulin stimulate cell ability burn glucose . This decrease insulin resistance help management PCOS . Considering beneficial effect standardize fenugreek seed extract , present study conduct evaluate efficacy fenugreek seed extract patient poly cystic ovary syndrome assess reduction ovarian volume decrease number ovarian cyst .</detailed_description>
