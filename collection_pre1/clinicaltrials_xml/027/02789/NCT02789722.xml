	<brief_summary>Mate yerba-mate ( Ilex paraguariensis A.St.-Hil . ) native plant South America highly consume region . Different traditional product ( mate , mate tea , chimarrao , terer√© ) obtain yerba-mate leaf consume herbal tea . Mate rich source bioactive phenolic compound , mainly caffeoylquinic acid . The richness different mono- dicaffeoylquinic acid peculiarity mate derive product . However , contrast plant-based beverage rich polyphenols like tea coffee , research industry yet little explored potential interest mate product promote human health . There grow interest development healthy food face burden cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , especially naturally rich bioactive phenolic compound protective effect development chronic disease . Different vitro animal study associate mate consumption cardiovascular protection mechanism . Consistent information activity long-term consumption effect humans scarce . The aim study ass randomize controlled trial impact chronic intake mate intermediate biomarkers cardiovascular health human identify possible involved nutrigenomic mechanism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Yerba Mate ( Ilex Paraguariensis A.St.-Hil . ) : Assessment Cardiovascular Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mate traditional drink obtain leave yerba-mate ( Ilex paraguariensis A.St.-Hil . ) , native specie South America great regional importance . Mate highly consume South America country tradition acquire native population . In country , mate consume largely tea ( camellia sinensis ) Asia Europe coffee Europe North America . Mate constitute raw material little explored compare plant product like coffee tea . However , mate product recently raise interest due high content phytochemical peculiarity phenolic profile , characterize wealth mono dicaffeoylquinic acid , know biological activity . A large number vitro study evaluate antioxidant capacity mate product different methodology , show antioxidant effect relate presence caffeoyl derivative . Mate appear potent inhibitor low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) oxidation . The phenolic compound mate also exhibit free radical scavenging property inhibit chemically induced oxidation lipid membrane . Different animal study report positive impact mate consumption cardiovascular risk factor . These publish data , obtain different rodent model diet induced dyslipidemia , obesity atherosclerosis , suggest supplementation mate product may improve plasma lipid profile , prevent hepatic fatty deposition , reduce insulin resistance , improve endothelial function inhibit atherosclerosis progression . Few clinical study report positive effect mate consumption blood lipid profile , glycemia anthropometric parameter healthy unhealthy subject . The aim study ass randomize controlled trial impact chronic intake mate intermediate biomarkers cardiovascular health human identify possible nutrigenomic mechanism involve . The study consist control , randomize , double blind , crossover clinical trial . This study involve 36 healthy middle-age ( 45-65 ) male subject select accord inclusion exclusion criterion previously establish . The study maximum duration 84 day include wash-out period . The volunteer consume daily 4 week mate extract ( standardized content phenolic compound ) placebo . At begin and/or end experimental period , blood sample measurement glycemic lipidic parameter , inflammatory marker transcriptome analysis . Urine sample also collect metabolomics analysis characterize exposure profile volunteer response mate phenolic compound consumption .</detailed_description>
