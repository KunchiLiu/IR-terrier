	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) neurodegenerative brain disorder impairs ability perform function groom , dress , cooking , activity daily live . PD affect 4.1 4.6 million people worldwide 2005 , project 9.3 million people affected 2030 . Although current pharmacological therapy provide beneficial effect motor symptom disease ( tremor , rigidity , bradykinesia ) , intolerable disability eventually develop patient . A disease-modifying therapy slow disease progression major unmet medical need PD . Numerous agent neuroprotective effect pre-clinical laboratory model , none show indisputable disease-modifying effect clinical trial patient PD . The purpose research study investigate brain motor behavior change PD time response rasagiline monoamine oxidase-B ( MAO-B ) inhibitor . The drug rasagiline test study MAO-B inhibitor . Rasagiline prescribe many year treat symptomatic Parkinson 's disease . It FDA approve treatment Parkinson 's disease show slow disease progression . The outcome impact study provide first evaluation MAO-B inhibitor slow progression nigrostriatal pathway use advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) method PD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants receive baseline test confirm diagnosis Parkinsonism determine eligibility research study . Half participant study group receive study drug ( rasagiline ) , half group receive placebo . A placebo pill make look like study drug , contain active ingredient . A computer algorithm randomly decide group assignment ( like flip coin ) . The study drug provide end first visit . The participant know study drug receive , placebo rasagiline . During research study follow test may occur : ( 1 ) questionnaire quality life depression ; ( 2 ) test measure strength motor function ; ( 3 ) test measure cognition ; ( 4 ) orientation session learn precision grip task ; ( 5 ) functional MRI scan brain ; ( 6 ) structural MRI scan brain ; ( 7 ) intravenous blood draw ( 7 tablespoon ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>96 patient clinically diagnose PD . For PD diagnosis , use University Kentucky PD brain bank diagnostic criterion implement movement disorder train neurologist . Only early stage PD within 5 year diagnosis never take rasagiline include . 5 year since diagnosis choose focus early stage PD , MAOB inhibitor show promise . PD eligible participate age 4077 , Hoehn Yahr stage &lt; equal 2 medication , able willing sign inform consent randomize placebo active drug arm . As necessitated risk Magnetic Resonance Imaging , patient type implanted electrical device ( cardiac pacemaker neurostimulator ) , certain type metallic clip body ( i.e. , aneurysm clip brain ) , eligible participation MRI portion study . Individuals claustrophobic also exclude participation . Women might pregnant nurse mother eligible . Pregnancy test carry female subject prior MRI scan . Individuals psychiatric disorder dementia exclude , along neurologic orthopedic problem impair hand movement walk . Individuals history metalworking involve cut process grind , filing , shave , thread , need radiological clearance participate study . Specifically , individual report history metalworking refer Radiology Shands University Florida ( UF ) orbitofrontal xray . In addition , individual sustain eye injury involve metal also refer Radiology Shands UF orbitofrontal xray . Shands UF provide write report state whether individual safe image 3 Tesla . All expense relate procedure cover PI . Patients prior stroke brain tumor exclude . Patients exclude cognitive impairment assess Montreal Cognitive Assessment score &lt; 23 unwilling comply study procedure .</criteria>
