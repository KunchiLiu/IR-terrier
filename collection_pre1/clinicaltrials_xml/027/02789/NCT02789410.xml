	<brief_summary>Intrathecal ( IT ) opioids commonly administer local anesthetic spinal anesthesia post-Cesarean delivery analgesia . Traditionally , IT morphine use use IT hydromorphone grow . A previous study show effective dose postoperative analgesia 90 % patient ( ED90 ) IT hydromorphone IT morphine ( NCT02009722 ) . These dos find 75 mcg hydromorphone 150 mcg morphine . The current propose study would compare duration analgesia IT morphine v IT hydromorphone elective cesarean delivery . Additionally , investigator compare drug respect incidence nausea pruritus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spinal anesthesia common anesthetic technique use Cesarean delivery United States across world . Intrathecal opioids administer local anesthetic spinal anesthesia post-Cesarean delivery analgesia . The effectiveness intrathecal morphine post-Cesarean pain control well establish , use intrathecal hydromorphone patient population grow . No prospective study conduct specifically compare efficacy intrathecal morphine versus hydromorphone post-Cesarean analgesia . After intrathecal administration , opioid drug disposition depend lipid solubility individual drug . Because hydrophilic nature , CSF concentration morphine decline slowly similar dos lipophilic drug . This account rostral spread , great dermatomal analgesia , long duration action compare highly lipophilic opioids like fentanyl sufentanil . When use post-cesarean analgesia , intrathecal morphine duration action 14-36 hour wide variation individual patient . While hydromorphone similar chemically morphine , lipid soluble . This decrease spread within intrathecal space enhances penetration dorsal horn spinal cord interaction opioid receptor occur . These difference two medication may influence duration action . Theoretically , would reduce duration action intrathecal hydromorphone compare intrathecal morphine . Retrospective study show analgesic benefit intrathecal hydromorphone appear extend least 12 hour cesarean delivery may extend 24 hour . Although effective reduce pain , intrathecal opioids associate side effect include pruritus , nausea , respiratory depression . A meta-analysis review twenty-eight study investigate intrathecal morphine versus placebo demonstrate moderate increase incidence pruritus , nausea vomit . In fact incidence nausea IT morphine report nearly 33 % . The difference pharmacokinetics morphine hydromorphone may also create difference side effect profile . Some study find hydromorphone cause less nausea pruritus morphine , others . Although opioid-induced respiratory depression rare event , study evaluate intrathecal hydromorphone post-Cesarean delivery pain report case respiratory depression . In study , investigator aim compare duration analgesia intrathecal morphine vs. hydromorphone analgesia cesarean delivery . Secondarily , investigator compare side effect drug , include nausea pruritus . To achieve goal study , important study equipotent dose medication . Previous work investigator study find effective dose postoperative analgesia 90 % patient ( ED90 ) 75 micrograms intrathecal hydromorphone 150 microgram intrathecal morphine . However , know two equipotent medication dos provide similar duration analgesia . The investigator hypothesize 150 mcg intrathecal morphine result long duration analgesia compare 75 microgram intrathecal hydromorphone . Additionally , investigator hypothesize pruritus intrathecal hydromorphone group early surgery , difference side effect 24 hour surgery .</detailed_description>
