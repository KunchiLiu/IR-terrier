	<brief_summary>Physicians know patient react differently medical treatment : , drug prove inefficient , whereas others might provoke side-effects , sometimes rather serious . Such difference response drug intake due several factor , molecular variation specific gene , name `` ADME `` ( Absorption , Distribution , Metabolism , Excretion ) . This project aim investigate evolutionary mechanism responsible diversity ADME gene human population . Because role interface organism chemical environment , ADME gene likely target recent selective pressure link change environment human evolve , change dietary habit instance . The aim project study diversity ADME gene expression five population locate along latitudinal axis extend East Africa Central Europe , pass Arabian Peninsula Mediterranean area , take account environmental factor might influence evolution diversity . This project thus intend evidence evolutionary mechanism shape genomic region functionally important clinical epidemiological point view . Moreover , allow u extend knowledge human molecular diversity evolution key-region people history specie .</brief_summary>
