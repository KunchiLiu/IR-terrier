	<brief_title>Multi- Level Integrated Analysis Mechanisms Underlying Atrial Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While many sub-aims study , overarch goal define molecular mechanism underlie atrial dysfunction . Here investigator provide power calculation base detect genetic control point gene expression ( eQTLs ) human atrial fibroblast . The investigator many others show tissue-specific eQTLs robustly identify genome-wide significance segregate population ~200 . In study investigator propose eQTL association analysis human , previously successfully perform cohort less 1000 subject . The general applicability approach validate multiple study across multiple tissue cohort 200-1000 subjects.Based publish image genetic study successfully apply small cohort ( &lt; 500 ) success echo-based , semi-quantitative study ventricular dimension , investigator confident quantitative study 750 individual power detect genome wide significant locus trait study . Despite intensive research critical gap knowledge mechanism underlie atrial fibrillation , major cause stroke heart failure increasingly common disease elderly . This project address important gap knowledge provide new insight disease pathogenesis goal stratify participant prevent stroke treat underlying substrate .</detailed_description>
