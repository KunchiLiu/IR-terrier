	<brief_summary>Patients high-risk solid tumor , refractory standard front therapy relapse completion therapy , poor prognosis despite attempt induce remission salvage regimen . Novel therapies critical patient population high-risk cancer . The ability tumor recognize lysed immune system offer unique opportunity aid tumor eradication expand activate anti-tumor cell . Through ability harness sophisticate specific immunotherapy , residual relapse disease resistant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy could eradicate . Prior study suggest safety expand specific T cell efficacy set melanoma , lymphoma viral eradication . While therapy previously limit versatility tumor down-regulate antigen evade single immune-target , use multi-antigen specific T cell may permit good durable anti-tumor immunity . Thus , investigator propose infuse specific multi-antigen anti-tumor T lymphocytes patient high risk solid tumor . This trial conduct demonstrate safety cell generate efficacy biology data may important future study may enhance tumor immunotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Research Study Utilizing Expanded Multi-antigen Specific Lymphocytes Treatment Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I dose-escalation trial design evaluate safety administer rapidly generate TAA CTL patient undergone allogeneic HSCT conventional therapy high-risk solid tumor due presence refractory , relapse and/or residual detectable disease . Pediatric adult patient high-risk solid tumor know positivity one Tumor Antigen Associated ( TAA ) ( WT1 , PRAME and/or survivin ) eligible . Patients enrol one two group : group A include patient undergone allogeneic HSCT part prior therapy group B include patient undergone standard therapy include allogeneic HSCT . TAA CTL may generate donor lymphocyte ( group A ) obtain either patient peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) donor PBMC host lymphocyte ( group B ) . Group A patient ( post allogeneic HSCT ) : TAA-CTL infused time neutrophil engraftment post-HSCT day 30 , whichever come first . Group B patient ( prior allogeneic HSCT ) : TAA-CTL infused time &gt; 1 week complete recent course conventional ( non-investigational ) therapy disease . This protocol design phase I dose-escalation study . Three different TAA CTL dose level evaluate treatment group ( A B ) ( see ) 2 4 patient enrol dose level . Dose Level One : 1 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Two : 2 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level Three : 4 x 107 cells/m2 Patients receive cell due presence refractory disease and/or high risk disease relapse and/or residual detectable disease follow conventional therapy time infusion . Ideally , patient receive systemic antineoplastic agent least 6 week infusion TAA CTL ( purpose evaluation ) , although treatment may add deemed critical patient care attend physician . Each patient receive least one TAA CTL infusion may receive maximum 8 dos . The first second dos administer 45 day apart additional dos space every 4 week . The expected volume infusion 1 10 cc . If patient measurable evaluable disease response stable disease well RECIST criterion day 28 evaluation dose 2 subsequent evaluation eligible receive 6 additional dos CTLs monthly interval . Each subsequent dose enrollment dose level ( i.e . subsequent dose escalation ) . Patients able receive additional dos initial safety profile complete day 28 follow second infusion .</detailed_description>
