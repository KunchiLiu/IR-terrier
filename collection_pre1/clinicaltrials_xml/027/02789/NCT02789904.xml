	<detailed_description>Purpose Current standard care algorithm use high sensitivity troponin T ( hsTnT ) require 6.5 hour diagnose ACS . Data stratify base upon time symptom onset gender . A health economics outcome model apply use optimal high sensitivity troponin I ( hsTnI ) cut-off value draw time determine cost outcome benefit predict optimal utilization hsTnI . A chest pain registry set compare high sensitivity troponin I ( hsTnI ) versus high sensitivity troponin T ( hsTnT ) patient present emergency department require blood draw . The outcomes patient track study period . The purpose conduct study evaluation : 1 . To shorten chest pain protocol suitable patient &lt; 3 hour compare current 6 hour protocol late high sensitivity Troponin I assay . 2 . To determine validity Abbott ARCHITECT i2000 Beckman Coulter ACCESS AccuTnI+3 accelerate algorithm comparison standard care acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) algorithm high sensitivity troponin T ( hsTnT ) assay , rule-out rule-in ACS within 3 hour presentation emergency room ( ER ) isolate suspected ACS . 3 . To establish local reference norm hsTnI assay . Additionally , study also seek validate use 3-D Vector ECG system develop Ngee Ann Polytechnic , see whether improved sensitivity specificity diagnosis myocardial infarction ECG achieve use vectorcardiography rather conventional 12-lead ECG recording . 2.0 Scope Under current clinical algorithm Singapore General Hospital , ambulatory chest pain patient ( CPP ) receive initial evaluation upon presentation ER include ECG blood draw . The lab spin hold blood await add-on order cardiac marker clinically-indicated . Other chest pain patient arrive ambulance may ECG take ambulance result fax ahead ER . Those initial ECG consistent ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) receive immediate intervention . Patients STEMI identify evaluate ER physician soon possible clinical sign symptom ACS , well , diagnosis require clinical treatment and/or hospital admission . Patients suspect ACS require serial Troponin measurement essential information rule-in rule-out non-ST elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) . After see patient , ER physicians add-on hsTnT measurement sample drawn presentation hold lab . This second hsTnT value draw two hour presentation . Using current standard care hsTnT assay universal definition , acute MI Singapore General Hospital define troponin rise and/or fall least one value 30pg/mL symptom suggestive myocardial ischemia . There clear definition amount rise fall require . The reference range single troponin T measurement Singapore General Hospital currently define abnormal 30pg/mL . This study compare ARCHITECT hsTnI assay Beckman Coulter ACCESS AccuTnI+3 assay use respective Abbott ARCHITECT Beckman Coulter UniCel DxI 800 immunoassay system , hsTnT use Roche analyzer . Troponin I sensitive marker myocardial necrosis , elevate due intraluminal coronary thrombus relate atherosclerotic plaque rupture spontaneous coronary artery disease ( CAD ) event ( MI Type I ) . STEMI patient exclude study . The scope study limit rule-in rule-out NSTEMI ER patient suspect ACS known cause elevate troponin . Healthcare data set Singapore General Hospital cost data use assess cost impact alternative model NSTEMI diagnosis aggressive hsTnI algorithm . A 30 day , Year 1 , 2 5 follow-up phone contact conjunction medical record review screen data use cardiologist determine diagnosis confirm patient outcome . Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarctions ( NSTEMIs ) subtle change morphology may obvious 12-lead ECG . This limit 12-lead ECG 's ability affirmatively indicate presence absence NSTEMIs . The 3-D Vector ECG system develop Ngee Ann Polytechnic , similarity vector cardiography ( VCG , i.e . Frank lead system ) postulate good sensitivity MI routine 12-lead ECG . Modern graphical user interface technique use 3-D Vector ECG system make interpretation easy VCG . Additionally , since electrode placement identical 12-lead ECG . The clinical procedure acquire signal disrupt , increase viability integration exist workflow . 3.0 Study Design Procedures Chest pain patient identify consented ER wait area follow initial triage exclusion STEMI within 1 hour initial blood draw presentation . For chest pain registry , coordinator also invite NHCS inpatient participate . The Clinical Coordinators , guidance Study Team investigator , responsible identify appropriate study candidate join study . They assist study team investigator explain purpose study obtain informed consent additional blood draw well follow-up telephone/ medical record outcome survey . Patients invite join registry detail regard clinical finding , relevant investigation clinical outcome store possible future reference database . Additionally , patient also ask 6-minute ECG perform . The Clinical Coordinators perform 3 phlebotomy draw , must occur within follow window period presentation draw include study : Draw Window period presentation draw 0h 0-30 min 1. h 60-90 min 2. h 120 - 150 min Specimens collect 5.0 ml Gel tube ( Serum Separator Tube ) . A total approximately 15 ml blood collect patient . The blood sample process National Heart Centre Singapore ( NHCS ) laboratory . The clinical coordinator store patient 's serum 2 separate vial freeze freezer ≤-80°C . The frozen serum sample use perform hsTnI assay Abbott ARCHITECT i2000 analyzer NHCS ACCESS AccuTnI+3 assay Beckman Coulter UniCel Dxl 800 analyzer SGH Pathology study coordinator SGH Pathology lab staff respectively . The screening Case Report Form require completion gather information 3 key element : 1 ) chest pain onset/characteristics ; 2 ) comprehensive demographic describe study population ; 3 ) data TIMI risk score generation ( Appendix I ) . To assess use 3D-Vector ECG , target 1000 12-lead ECGs retrieve electrocardiographs SGH Emergency Department triage , post-analysis do NHCS . The retrieved ECGs convert 3D-vector ECG analyse extract discriminate parameter reliably use diagnose localise presence ischaemia . Accuracy diagnose counter check result diagnostic test perform patient normal course treatment . From analysis 1000 record , sensitivity specificity 3D-Vector ECG localise acute coronary syndrome compute . 4.0 Lab Test Orders , Blood Draws , Analysis After clinical assessment patient ER physician , add-on troponin may order clinical purpose physician applied time zero `` presentation '' blood draw . Likewise , 2-hour troponin may order clinical purpose . Analysis Beckman Coulter ACCESS AccuTnI+3 assay take place UniCel DxI 800 immunoassay system Singapore General Hospital ( SGH ) Pathology . Analysis ARCHITECT hsTnI assay take place Abbott ARCHITECT i2000 analyzer National Heart Centre Singapore ( NHCS ) Laboratory . Calibration , Calibration verification , cross-over validation , daily Quality Control hsTnI assay perform medical technologist conjunction normal laboratory operation . 6.0 Study Duration 4,000 patient expect included study period 5 year day recruitment . Recruitment new patient end 4,000 patient enrol . 7.0 Data Retrieval Laboratory data store SingHealth Information System . Extraction data accomplish export Excel spreadsheet . Clinical data print entered computer database use standardized case report form . 8.0 Telephone/ Medical record Follow-up Study patient contact telephone/ medical record Day 30 , Year 1 , Year 2 Year 5 recruitment clinical event symptom relevant adjudication .</detailed_description>
