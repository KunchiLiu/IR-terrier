	<brief_summary>Neoadjuvant therapy give breast cancer patient whose cancer relatively large spread lymph node . The primary goal treatment prevent cancer come back ( recur ) elsewhere body , make cancer breast lymph node shrink might easier remove . This could allow patient lumpectomy instead mastectomy reduce number lymph node surgeon remove . In case , neoadjuvant therapy work well kill cancer breast lymph node . This refer pathologic complete response ( pCR ) . Patients achieve pCR much low risk cancer recur elsewhere body . Investigators n't sure chemotherapy drug work best HER2-targeted drug , combination drug cause few side effects.Thus , study two main goal : 1 . To find treatment wPCbTP , weekly paclitaxel carboplatin give trastuzumab pertuzumab every 3 week , lead many pCRs TCHP patient HER2-positive breast cancer , few side effect . 2 . To find HER2-positive patient whose cancer respond well 12 week wPCbTP get good response switch doxorubicin-containing regimen call AC 4 cycle ( 8-12 week ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma breast , sufficient tissue available needle incisional biopsy ( excisional biopsy permit ) ER , PR HER2 test . 2 . Resectable clinical stage I ( T=2.0 cm ) , IIAIIIA T2 N0T3N0 T13 N1N2a unresectable clinical stage IIIBC T4 N2b3 disease . No evidence M1 disease . Pretreatment clinical stage record treat physician . 3 . Breast tumor measure least 1 cm great dimension ultrasound MRI ; patient without measurable disease breast ( TX ) image study eligible measurable disease ( node measure least 1 cm along short axis , histologically confirm contain metastatic disease ) axilla . 4 . HER2+ , define either IHC 3+ amplification HER2 gene FISH analysis ( ratio &gt; 2.0 &gt; 6 HER2 target per cell ; patient equivocal HER2 testing , 2+ IHC FISH ratio &lt; 2.0 46 HER2 signal per nucleus , eligible ) . 5 . Patients multiple foci invasive cancer breast eligible single lesion meet size criterion sample lesion histologically similar HER2+ ( whether radiographically detect lesion separate target lesion sample histologic evaluation leave discretion treat physician ) . The presence DCIS LCIS either breast render patient ineligible . Patients small focus invasive cancer detect contralateral breast ( clinical T1a/bN0 ) eligible , whether contralateral tumor HER2+ HER2 , patient advance cancer contralateral breast eligible ; patient small focus invasive cancer contralateral breast histologic response breast contain target lesion consider determine patient 's pathologic response . 6 It recommend patient pretreatment echocardiogram MUGA scan LVEF institutional low limit normal . 7 . Female , age &gt; 18 , Zubrod PS 01 . 8 . It recommend patient adequate bone marrow , renal hepatic function . Examples include : ANC &gt; 1000/ul , platelet count &gt; 100,000/ul , HGB &gt; 9.0 g/dl , serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl measure creatinine clearance &gt; 30 ml/min AST &lt; 5 x ULN . 9 . Signed informed consent . 1 . Prior chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiation therapy cancer 2 . Patients congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction , unstable angina pectoris arterial thrombotic event within past 12 month , uncontrolled hypertension ( SBP &gt; 160 DBP &gt; 90 ) , uncontrolled clinically significant arrhythmia , grade II great peripheral vascular disease prior history stroke TIA ( transient ischemic attack ) . 3 . Pregnant lactate woman eligible . All patient reproductive potential negative pregnancy test baseline advise use effective barrier method contraception sexually active treatment study 2 month post last treatment . Sites ask confirm patient 's menopausal status study entry premenopausal woman negative pregnancy test perform within 7 day start treatment , require submit test result . 4 . Active nonbreast malignancy . 5 . Baseline grade &gt; 2 peripheral neuropathy</criteria>
