	<brief_summary>Every year 1,000 child undergo eye muscle surgery provide physician institution . For many child surgical procedure eye muscle correction . All child experience differ degree postoperative pain . The pain associate strabismus surgery due manipulation conjunctival area handle Tenon 's capsule , sclera stretch eye muscle . Research demonstrate repeat painful procedure result increased anxiety increase pain . Previous study demonstrate child experience preoperative anxiety likely increase postoperative pain . This increase preoperative anxiety may also contribute sleep difficulty increase analgesic consumption . Depending age child , different method use reduce anxiety distraction , child life service , anti-anxiolytic agent . In addition pain , child undergo strabismus surgery frequently experience postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) .This increase incidence nausea vomit thought relate use opiates pain control . Short act opiate use preferentially hospital belief reduces recovery issue sedation PONV . Preliminary data , however , suggest difference recovery outcomes fentanyl versus hydromorphone . The purpose study investigate optimal analgesia create standardize approach pain management pediatric patient undergo surgery strabismus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pain Medications Children Undergoing Strabismus Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Design This randomized clinical trial mask assessment , compare recovery index patient receive longer act versus shorter act opiate analgesia use hydromorphone fentanyl intraoperative analgesic . An otherwise standardize anesthetic analgesic regimen utilized , consistent routine care research institution . Sample Setting Patients include child age 3 10 year schedule strabismus surgery . The procedure may also include scheduled exam anesthesia ( EUA ) eye , surgical procedure conjunction strabismus exclude enrollment . Review anesthesia record show 480 patient meet inclusion criterion precede 12 month . The primary outcome measure pain measure revised Faces , Legs , Anxiety , Cry &amp; Consolability scale ( rFLACC ) . Based previous pilot work , investigator expect pain score mean five standard deviation two . The goal detect change one point rFLACC score , investigator believe would clinically significant . With alpha 0.05 power 0.80 , investigator would need 64 patient arm one point decrease rFLACC score statistically significant . The investigator expect ten percent patient drop miss data , investigator propose enroll 71 patient arm ( 142 patient total ) order data 64 patient analysis . Inclusion criteria 1 ) child age 3 10 year old strabismus surgery first time , repeat strabismus surgery , eye examination strabismus anesthesia ; 2 ) child evaluated American Society Anesthesiologists Physical Status ( ASAPS ) classification Class 1 2 ; 3 ) caregiver present hospital ; 4 ) child caregiver must English speaking . Exclusion criterion include 1 ) child evaluate ASAPS Class 3 4 ; non-English speaking child parent ; 3 ) additional surgery perform time ; 4 ) child document behavioral disability ; 5 ) prior participation study . Tools A researcher develop demographic questionnaire use collect information parent include patient age , gender , previous surgery , medication allergy , primary caregiver . The Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety Information Scale ( APAIS ) use assess parent feeling anxiety preoperative phase . The APAIS short 6-item questionnaire acceptable reliability Cronbach 's alpha great equal 70 correlate highly ( 0.74 ) widely use State Trait Anxiety Scale . Because length , APAIS quickly administer parent child undergo surgery order ass parental preoperative anxiety . The measure complete parent participant consent obtain . The tool take approximately 1-2 minute score . For evaluate anxiety child Modified Anxiety Scale ( mYPAS ) use . The mYPAS frequently use measure anxiety prior induction demonstrate inter intra-rater reliability ( use k statistic ) range 0.63 - 0.90 acceptable reliability ( p = 0.01 , r = 0.79 ) The tool administer less one minute , reliable child age 2-12 year , use five area ( activity , vocalization , expression , arousal , interaction ) rate preoperative anxiety . In Post Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) Same Day Surgery ( SDS ) , nurse use rFLACC scale measure pain . The tool establish reliability validity use throughout hospital ass pain child unable verbalize pain . The interrater reliability reveal intra-class correlation coefficient range 0.76-0.90 . Criterion validity ( p=0.65-0.87 ) support correlation parent child score . For pain assessment 24 hour post operatively , parent ask rate intensity subject 's pain scale 0 ( pain ) 10 ( bad pain imaginable ) . The Numeric Pain Rating Scale develop McCaffery widely use instrument clinical setting previously establish reliability validity . The instrument score 0 = pain ; 1-3 = mild pain ; 4-6 = moderate pain ; 7-10 = severe pain . Procedure IRB approval secure prior recruitment . As standard care , subject contact telephone day prior schedule surgery . During contact , subject inform offer participate study , provide brief description protocol . On day surgery , researcher visit interested subject provide complete explanation write consent document . Consenting subject evaluate Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety Scale , researcher complete YPAS-m scale prior surgery . At time consent obtain , subject also ask complete brief demographic data form . After surgery , nurse evaluate patient 's pain use rFLACC scale arrival Post Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) every fifteen minute patient 's stay . After transfer PACU SDS , nurse continue evaluate pain use scale arrival discharge . The nurse document patient 's level pain need additional pain medication . To help ensure study fidelity regard pain assessment , nurse give refresher class use rFLACC . After discharge , patient receive telephone call 24 hour surgery evaluate post-operative nausea vomit level pain home . Patients receive standard anesthetic consist midazolam premedication indicate anticipated separation anxiety , sevoflurane inhalation utilize nitrous oxide mask induction , nitrous oxide maintenance anesthesia . Analgesia PONV prophylaxis standardize acetaminophen 15 mg/kg oral preoperative ( maximum 650 ) , follow ketorolac 0.5 mg/kg IV ( maximum 30 ) , ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg IV , dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg IV . Airway maintenance laryngeal mask , emergence conduct operating room aim responsive patient time departure operate room . Patients randomize either hydromorphone fentanyl operate room opening seal protocol envelope . The anesthesiologist fractionate total dose opiate administer clinical situation warrant preserve spontaneous breathing . The anesthesiologist titrate drug require first 15 minute recovery room ensure immediate analgesic goal meet .</detailed_description>
