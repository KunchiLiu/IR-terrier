	<detailed_description>Up 30-40 % patient operated colorectal cancer display tumor recurrence . Predictive biomarkers need identify patient high risk recurrence . Our main objective determine metabolite profile blood plasma patient operate colorectal cancer associate oncologic outcome validate prognostic biomarkers future study . A secondary objective study glycolytic metabolism colon cancer cell line treat plasma sample patient . In particular , validate increase utilization lactate tumor cell metabolic substrate use postoperative human sample , previously observe u vitro use inflammatory environment condition hypoxia lack glucose . Patients colorectal cancer undergone surgical resection include . Plasma sample obtain surgery 4th day 3rd , 6th , 12th , 18th month surgery . Metabolic profile plasma sample determine use kit allow quantification 180 metabolite mass spectrometry . Cellular assay perform SW620 HT-29 colon cancer cell line . Cells treat plasma sample concentration lactate metabolite analyze medium supernatant . A clinical follow maintain least 2 year identify tumor recurrence .</detailed_description>
