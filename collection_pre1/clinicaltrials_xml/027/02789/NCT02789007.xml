	<brief_summary>The main objective experiment assess impact parabolic flight ( 1 ) spatial memory orientation , ( 2 ) change brain structure function , particularly hippocampal formation , ( 3 ) biochemical marker stress neuroplasticity . A preliminary study perform aim ( 1 ) test weightlessness hardware use administer visuo-spatial testing ( 2 ) determine optimal body posture test microgravity condition ( i.e . body posture change visuo-spatial testing induce weightlessness maximal ) . The main criterion : - Structural functional change brain evaluate fMRI ; - Cognitive performance , specifically spatial cognition use series computer-based task . - Key neurotrophins determine venous blood sample The criterion use preliminary experiment visuo-spatial performance evaluate computer-based test assess spatial cognition . The investigator hypothesize hippocampal structure function , particularly dentate gyrus , alter parabolic flight compare ground base control . Specifically , 3 tested hypothesis : - Parabolic flight induces change hippocampal structure ; - Weightlessness induces change cognitive performance , specifically spatial cognition ; - There correlation change hippocampal structure change visuo-spatial memory performance . - There correlation change hippocampal structure change key neurotrophins . The hypothesis test preliminary experiment body posture affect change spatial cognition performance .</brief_summary>
