	<brief_title>Effects Emulsification Lipid Droplet Size Postprandial Metabolic Responses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct use randomize , crossover design three dietary phase : 1 ) fine emulsion beverage ( small lipid droplet size ) , 2 ) coarse emulsion beverage ( large lipid droplet size ) 3 ) non-emulsified oil water . All treatment consume together bread . All participant randomly allocate three test meal . Fifteen twenty participant age 21 50 year recruit general public Singapore . During test session , participant ' glycemic , insulinemic , lipidemic response gastric empty test meal measure . Gastric antral distention ultrasound measurement indirect measure gastric empty rate . Participants ' metabolic satiety test meal also assess regular interval throughout test session . Each test session take approximately four hour duration test session take place least five day apart .</detailed_description>
