Evidence personally sign date informed consent document indicate subject ( legal representative ) inform pertinent aspect study . Subjects willing able comply schedule visit , laboratory test , study procedure . Male subject agree [ female partner ( ) ] use acceptable contraceptive regimen throughout duration study . Acceptable contraception subject ( female partner ) surgically sterilize ; willing use condom plus contraceptive foam jelly ( female partner surgically sterilize ) . The subject ability willingness comply protocol requirement study , include fast refrain alcohol , nicotine caffeine consumption 48h prior checkin discharge unit . On morning endotoxin , Study Day 1 , prior dose , subject must normal stable baseline body temperature define average three consecutive oral temperature ( record , repeatedly , approximately every 1015 second ) 97.0 degree F ( 36.1°C ) 98.8 degree F ( 37.1°C ) differ &gt; 0.4 degree F ( &gt; 0.2 degree C ) . The subject high probability compliance completion study . Evidence history clinically significant dental ( presence abscess ) , hematological , renal , endocrine , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , psychiatric , neurologic , allergic disease . A positive urine drug test cannabinoids , amphetamine , barbiturate , cocaine , opiates , benzodiazepine , phencyclidine , and/or methadone alcohol ( breathalyzer ) test either Screening Day 1 . History evidence habitual use tobacco nicotinecontaining product within 3 month screen . A positive serum pregnancy test ( female ) Screening positive urine pregnancy test checkin . Subjects previously receive endotoxin ( LPS ) within previous 6 month know hypersensitivity endotoxin time . Subjects experience cold/flu symptom ( i.e. , runny nose , cough , and/or fever ) receive antibiotic treatment within 30 day undergone surgical procedure within 60 day prior endotoxin challenge History recurrent chronic infection type tuberculosis , sinusitis , urinary tract infection , respiratory tract dental ( abscess ) infection , etc . Also exclude subject recurrent oral genital herpes , recurrent herpes zoster , infection otherwise judge investigator potential exacerbation participation study . History syncope symptom lightheadedness associate blood draw History regular alcohol consumption exceed 7 drinks/week female 14 drinks/week male ( 1 drink = 5 ounce ( 150 mL ) wine 12 ounce ( 360 mL ) beer 1.5 ounce ( 45 mL ) hard liquor ) within 6 month Screening history drug use within 12 month prior study drug administration , Investigator consider abusive . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day ( determined local requirement ) 5 halflives , whichever longer , precede first dose study medication . Also , receive immunosuppressive drug receive vaccination within 3 month Day 1 Screening supine BP &gt; 140 &lt; 100 mm Hg ( systolic ) , &gt; 90 &lt; 60 mmHg ( diastolic ) ; follow least 5 minute rest . If BP &gt; 140 &lt; 100 mm Hg ( systolic ) , &gt; 90 &lt; 60 mm Hg ( diastolic ) , BP repeat two time median three systolic median three diastolic BP value use determine subject 's eligibility . If either median value outside criterion , subject exclude . Resting heart rate ( HR ) screen checkin Day 1 &lt; 50 bpm ( beat per minute ) follow least 10 minute rest either vital sign ECGs . If HR &lt; 50 bpm , HR repeat two time median three HR value use determine subject 's eligibility . If median value &lt; 50 bpm , subject exclude . 12 lead ECG demonstrate HR &lt; 50 bpm , QTc &gt; 450 QRS interval &gt; 120 msec screen checkin . If heart rate QTc exceed 450 msec , QRS exceed 120 msec , ECG repeat two time median three QTc value use determine subject 's eligibility . If median value parameter outside limit specify , subject exclude . Use prescription nonprescription drug dietary supplement , especially antiinflammatory property ( e.g . fish oil , turmeric , etc . ) within 7 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior receive endotoxin . Limited use nonprescription medication believe affect subject safety overall result study may permit casebycase basis . Use steroidal nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAID ) within 7 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) admission period specifically prohibit due potential confounding effect study PD endpoint History frequent headache ( &gt; 2 per month ) migraines headache absence caffeine coffee , tea , chocolate , caffeinerelated substance Caffeine consumption excess 3 cup per day Blood donation ( exclude plasma donation ) approximately 1 pint ( 500 mL ) within 56 day prior dose . Women nonchildbearing potential must : 1 . Surgically sterile ( removal ovary and/ uterus least 12 month prior dose ) . 2 . Naturally postmenopausal ( spontaneous cessation menses ) least 24 consecutive month prior dose Day 1 FSH level screen ≥ 40 mIU/mL . 3 . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test screen negative urine pregnancy checkin , must agree avoid pregnancy study . Pregnancy test screening , checkin , give time deem necessary PI designate . During study , woman childbearing potential must use two acceptable method contraception time . Medically acceptable contraceptive include : ( 1 ) document surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy ) , ( 2 ) barrier method ( condom diaphragm ) use spermicide , use condom spermicide ( 3 ) hormonal contraception ( combination oral contraceptive , transdermal patch , injectables , implantables vaginal ring ) ( 4 ) intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) . Abstinence acceptable form contraception study . Unwilling unable comply Lifestyle Guidelines describe protocol . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make subject inappropriate entry study . Subjects investigational site staff member directly involved conduct study family member , site staff member otherwise supervise Investigator directly involve conduct study . The subject clinically significant abnormal white blood cell ( WBC ) count , differential presence clinically significant WBCs microscopic examination urinalysis . The subject engage sunbathe physical exercise , sport exertion normal walk within 72h checkin The subject elevate temperature , presence dental/other abscess , chill , malaise , cough , cold , and/or headache suggestive occult infection ( viral , bacterial , etc. ) .
