	<detailed_description>Despite impressive capacity induce diabetes remission , gastric bypass surgery associate onset hyperglycemic peak , intensive transient , formally non diabetic patient . The aim study study digestion starch compare glucose ( glucose load ) gastric bypass surgery obese patient . Volunteers recruit among candidate gastric bypass , study 3 month surgery . They occasion 2 random meal , correspond 30g glucose , one make starch make glucose , naturally label 13C . The digestion starch assess increase plasma 13C-glucose tracer . Plasma sample collect 3 hour . Some study already investigated time absorption glucose , study examine time digestion glucose . Other study always use glucose syrup , result digestion . It reason , study , glucose syrup starch meal take patient glycaemia compare . In way , result obtain kinetic digestion starch . All patient two evaluation : one bypass surgery one 3 month . All evaluation include 2 standard meal . Patients fast , take randomize order glucose quantity : 30g , breakfast . After meal , blood sample collect 3 hour time 0 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 minute every 30 minute time 180 . The starch meal provide 30g glucose form corn starch . It consume 15 minute . They food meal . This quantity correspond patient ingest bypass surgery , poor size stomach . C13-carbon natural tracer corn . The measure increase C13-glucose plasma show appearance tracer , correspond starch digestion . The second meal compose 30g corn glucose ( glucose-meal ) , liquid form dive 3 portion ingest 15 minute , like starch meal . They food meal .</detailed_description>
