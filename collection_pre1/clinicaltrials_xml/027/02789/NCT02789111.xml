	<brief_title>Trial Alvimopan Major Spine Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain control follow major spine surgery difficult achieve . Opiates often necessary high dos , may associate significant side effect . Such side effect may include urinary retention , alter mental status , depress respiratory drive , constipation , may lead reduce nutritional intake postoperative period . Importantly , post-operative nutrition may impact incidence complication follow spine surgery.1 Alvimopan peripheral-acting opiate antagonist design decrease gastrointestinal complication perioperative systemic opioid administration . Pain control follow major spine surgery difficult achieve . Opiates often necessary high dos , may associate significant side effect include constipation . Alvimopan drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use help bowel recover quickly patient bowel surgery , eat solid food regular bowel movement . Alvimopan class medication call peripherally act mu-opioid receptor antagonist . It work protect bowel constipation effect opioid ( narcotic ) medication use treat pain surgery . The purpose study determine use alvimopan major spine surgery reduces time first bowel movement . By assess use alvimopan reconstructive spinal surgery patient , researcher hope give scientific community insight broad use drug surgical population , well gather information impact hospital charge overall post-operative patient satisfaction .</detailed_description>
