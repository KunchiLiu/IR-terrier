	<detailed_description>Severe critical illness often complicate Intensive Care Unit - Acquired Weakness ( ICU-AW ) , clinically characterized bilateral symmetrical limb weakness relate myopathy and/or axonal polyneuropathy . ICU-AW affect 25 % 60 % mechanically ventilate patient 7 day associate increased post-ICU mortality , delay wean mechanical ventilation long-term functional disability . Most patient develop ICU-AW admitted sepsis episode main risk factor ICU-AW include severity critical illness , immobilization , hyperglycemia use medication include steroid neuromuscular agent , although somewhat controversial . The pathophysiology critical illness myopathy think involve follow mechanism : 1 ) impairment muscular membrane excitability , secondary dysregulation sodium channel gating , 2 ) mitochondrial dysfunction lead bioenergetic failure oxidative stress 3 ) proteolysis , mainly related activation ubiquitin-proteasome pathway . These mechanism trigger various factor , notably systemic inflammatory mediator , endocrine dysfunction , immobilization , drug electrolyte disturbance . The protracted functional consequence ICU-AW indicate muscle regeneration also impair . Surprisingly , muscle regeneration , essentially depend muscle stem cell ( also call satellite cell ) , well investigate context critical illness . The satellite cell ( SC ) , locate periphery muscle fiber , activate response muscle injury proliferate differentiate repair replace damaged fiber , also self-renew replenish muscle stem cell reservoir . It recently demonstrate murine model polymicrobial peritonitis SC activation , proliferation expression myogenic marker impaired sepsis , lead impaired muscle regeneration , post-sepsis intramuscular administration exogenous Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( MSCs ) could reverse SC dysfunction . MSC treatment significantly improve post-injury muscle recovery decrease necrosis fibrosis also increase force isolated single fiber . The objective translational research identify mechanism Human SC dysfunction patient severe sepsis , describe vitro effect MSCs SC dysfunction .</detailed_description>
