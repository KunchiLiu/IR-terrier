	<detailed_description>A randomized pilot study design determine marginal bone change patient treat milled framework Co/Cr connection Internal External rehabilitation partially edentulous area multiunit screw retain bridge . The investigation perform one clinical centre affiliate Department Prosthodontics , Faculty Odontology , Malmö University . In center clinician examiner person . Following screen examination , subject meet inclusion criterion , sign Informed Consent enrol study . The period patient enrollment begin October 1st 2015 end September 31st 2016 . The patient randomize method base use seal opaque envelope . The case assign two different treatment group : Group A- Co/Cr mill framework internal connection ( Test ) Group B- Co/Cr mill framework external connection ( Control ) -Pre-treatment Patient data , medical history , clinical radiographic examination record patient . Clinical photograph take frontal , occlusal lateral projection Periodontal , endodontic open caries lesion treat prior implant installation . All patient receive careful oral hygiene instruction train self-performed plaque control measure . Orthopantomogram constant magnification CT scan compute exam carry . Plaster model diagnostic wax-up carry . -First Surgical Phase ( Implant Installation ) The patient receive antibiotic prophylaxis ( Amoxicillin 1gr ) one hour prior surgery completion implant installation suture removal 1gr three time day . ( If patient allergic amoxicillin examiner prescribes antibiotic discretion posology ) . The surgical treatment perform local anaesthesia . In case remain teeth , extract conventional technique implant ' placement . Implants place accord guideline describe Astra Tech Osseospeed EV® manual `` Surgical procedure '' , use two-stage protocol . Implant spin position cover screw registered positive , present , negative . The operation finalize careful adaption flap mean accurate suture order obtain full periosteal coverage . Intraoral clinical photograph , surgery take . -Post-operative care The patient instruct rinse chlorhexidine 0.12 % mouthrinse tell rinse antiseptic solution three time day 2 week . The patient advise take NSAIDs pain relief discretion . Liquid semisolid food prescribe first post-operative week , suture remove . Two week operation denture properly reline second stage surgery . Patients control third sixth week . -Prosthetic procedure After eight week ( + 2 ) implant heal second stage surgery apply Healing Abutment perform group A Uni Abutment 33° connection procedure perform . In group B . Impression customize spoon Impregum material take one week second surgery prosthetic procedure perform accord Atlantis-Isus Dentsply Astra-tech prosthetic manual recommendation . After 6 week ( + 2 ) impression definitive fix dental prosthesis screw retained multiunits bridge apply . The prosthesis make accomplish normal hygienic procedure . All prosthetic procedure make accordance Astra Tech procedures &amp; product manual . The length bridge cantilever duly calculate minimize implant overload accord Atlantis-Isus recommendation group . -Post-prosthetic measurement Clinical measurement Clinical examination perform immediately follow installation definitive prosthesis ( Baseline-Loading ) 1 , 3 , 5 year . In particular , plaque soft-tissue inflammation register . Clinical photograph take interval point . Plaque : presence plaque score implant site well level remain teeth four surface ( buccal , lingual/palatal , mesial , distal ) . The mean percentage plaque harbor surface calculate use case unit . Soft-tissue inflammation : presence soft-tissue inflammation ( bleed probe ) assess buccal , lingual/palatal , mesial , distal aspect implant . The mean percentage inflame site calculate use case unit . - Radiographic measurement Peri-apical radiograph take prosthesis insertion ( Baseline ) 1 , 3 , 5 year . The radiograph take X-ray apparatus supply long cone examiner visit time . Rinn centrators use ensure reproducibility measurement marginal bone level change . The radiographic image analyse Department Radiology Sahlgrenska Academy , Gothenburg University experience radiologist otherwise involve study . 9 . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Results present appropriate descriptive inferential statistic . Demographic baseline characteristic present mean descriptive statistic . Continuous variable present mean number observation ( N ) , minimum ( min ) , median , maximum ( max ) , mean standard deviation ( std ) . Discrete variable present frequency percentage .</detailed_description>
