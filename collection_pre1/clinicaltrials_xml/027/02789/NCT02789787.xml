	<brief_summary>Patients cleave lip palate frequently develop Class III ( Cl III ) malocclusion underbites follow early cleft repair surgery . This clinical trial compare current standard care treat Cl III malocclusion , orthognathic ( jaw ) surgery pubertal growth ( 16-21 year ) , alternative orthopedic approach protract maxilla adolescence ( 11-14 year ) . At Children 's Hospital Los Angeles ( CHLA ) , early adolescent cleave lip palate Cl III malocclusion offer alternative non-surgical approach correct malocclusion call `` maxillary protraction '' . Prior age 14 , maxillary suture fuse mobilized alternate weekly expansion constriction rapid palatal expander ( RPE ) , thereby allow upper jaw ( maxilla ) pull forward ( protract ) correct underbite . This prospective parallel cohort study ass patient undergoing treatment Cl III malocclusion either orthognathic surgery maxillary protraction four data collection time point treatment . The data include digitize study model , photograph radiograph , quality life survey ( SF12 , YQOL ) , parent survey ( ASEBA ) , treatment cost , periodontal measurement treatment complication . The study design descriptive cohort study examine success treatment ( % require second surgery ) , dental skeletal change associate treatment , stability treatment behavioural/adaptive factor ( ASEBA ) contribute success lack success treatment . The primary trial conduct Children 's Hospital Los Angeles pilot study confirm translation different setting conduct Seattle Children 's Hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Effectiveness Late Maxillary Protraction Cleft Lip Palate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Cleft lip palate common facial birth defect . Patients cleave lip palate frequently develop Class III ( Cl III ) malocclusion underbites current standard care treat Cl III malocclusion orthognathic ( jaw ) surgery . Orthognathic surgery perform late teenager 's life pubertal growth complete , long recovery period , risk segment loss nerve injury expensive insurer . Moreover , surgical correction relapse require second jaw surgery . Intervention : The current standard care correct Cl III malocclusion orthognathic surgery pubertal growth complete . At Children 's Hospital , early adolescent ( 11 - 14 yr ) cleft lip palate Cl III malocclusion offer alternative non-surgical approach correct malocclusion call `` maxillary protraction '' . At age 11- 14 , maxillary suture fuse mobilized alternate weekly expansion constriction rapid palatal expander ( RPE ) , thereby allow upper jaw ( maxilla ) pull forward ( protract ) order correct underbite . Purpose : This study compare occlusal , photographic , radiographic , periodontal quality life data collect four different timepoints patient treated correction Cl III malocclusion either LeFort I maxillary advancement surgery non-surgical maxillary protraction . Study Population : The inclusion criterion patient diagnose isolated cleft lip palate Cl III malocclusion , time enrollment , medical condition prevent undergo orthognathic surgery maxillary protraction procedure . The two study group differ age treatment . One group patient , age 11 -14 year age , choose undergo maxillary protraction via sutural loosen correction Cl III malocclusion . The group patient , age 16 21 year , elect undergo orthognathic surgery correction Cl III malocclusion . Study Methodology : This non-randomized prospective parallel cohort study follow treatment outcome approximately 100 patient cleft lip palate Cl III malocclusion treat maxillary protraction maximal age 14 year ( target N=50 ) vs. orthognathic surgery maximal age 21 year ( target N=50 ) . Description Treatment Arms : The first treatment arm consist participant choose undergo orthodontic ( non-surgical ) maxillary protraction procedure . The second treatment arm consist participant choose undergo orthognathic ( jaw ) surgical procedure . Outcomes : The outcome measure group bite correction ( GOSLON yardstick ) , facial esthetic , change cephalometric x-ray measurement , youth quality life ( YQOL ) , psychological/behavioral assessment survey ( ASEBA ) , cost , periodontal health , complication stability treatment . Follow-up : Participants arm study ( protraction vs. surgery ) data collect prior , , immediately , 1 year treatment . Statistics Plans Analysis : The % patient require surgery reason relapse incomplete treatment examine use collect data . The investigator examine factor associate successful outcomes treatment adjust factor model .</detailed_description>
