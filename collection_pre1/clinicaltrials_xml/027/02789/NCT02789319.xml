To access full protocol : http : //dst.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/12/10/1932296815614587.full.pdf+html The clinical site ( ) recruit subject test fingerstick blood directly Blood Glucose Monitor Systems . Tubes fingerstick blood also collect subject , centrifuge plasma collect frozen shipment Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) /College American Pathologists ( CAP ) certify , accredit clinical chemistry laboratory measurement comparative glucose analyzer . In addition , National Institute Standards Technology ( NIST ) glucose standard ( 965b ) assay comparative glucose analyzer determine bias true glucose value establish reference mass spectrometry method . This series sub-studies assess accuracy various BGMSs train professional , intended end user . Only accuracy BGMSs test perform trained study staff assess . Understanding end user instruction use ( label ) human factor analysis within scope protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- This blanket protocol cover series vitro diagnostic , Phase 4 , sub-studies determine performance 18 various market blood glucose meter system 12 month period . All activity perform sub-studies fall within parameter outline protocol . - At least 100 125 subject participate sub-study - All activity conduct accord Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) - The protocol , informed consent form , advertisement , appropriate document , submit Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval prior study conduct . - Informed consent obtain subject sub-study . The informed consent form sub-study clearly identify explain specific procedure sub-study . - All value obtain Blood Glucose Monitor Systems ( BGMS ) assay clinical site compare glucose value plasma subject . Plasma sample properly prepared clinical site , frozen ship dry ice Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) /College American Pathologists ( CAP ) certified/accredited laboratory analysis glucose comparative instrument - Glucose Comparative instrument test appropriate manufacturer control well National Institute Standards Technology ( NIST ) 965b control assure accuracy quality ( analytical imprecision &lt; 2.9 % bias &lt; 2.2 % , total error &lt; 6.9 % ) - Brief demographic medical history information collect subject . In addition , information collect regard medication take previous 48 hour subject acetaminophen , ibuprofen , salicylate-containing drug , ascorbic acid-containing drug since compound could affect test result - Trained study staff perform shallow deep finger puncture subject use sterile lance device obtain capillary blood test BGMSs , well test comparative glucose instrument - subject ask self-testing - Subject 's capillary blood directly apply test strip BGMSs per label device - In case , subject 's fingerstick blood also collect micro-tube modify ( example , glycolyzed ) obtain blood sample hypoglycemic range BGMSs oxygen insensitive since oxygen level blood change glycolysis . - Testing blood may include , limited : -glucose concentration measure BGMS , hematocrit , comparative glucose assay - A volume great 2000 microliters finger stick capillary blood obtain subject single visit site - No ten finger puncture perform subject . The number type finger stick subject may receive sub-study disclose sub-study informed consent form . All lancet sterile ; may either one time use device , lance device lancet generally use people diabetes self-monitoring blood glucose . A new lancing device use subject . - Study document retain investigative clinical site , clinical laboratory Sponsor ( Diabetes Technology Society ) require GCP le 3 year follow publication result . - Plasma subject ship accredited clinical laboratory assay use appropriate shipping method biological specimen - A Contracted Research Organization ( CRO ) oversee study , monitor clinical laboratory site , conduct Part 11 compliant data management , perform statistical analysis , create report post result clintrials.gov DTS Blood Glucose Monitor System Surveillance Program website create .
