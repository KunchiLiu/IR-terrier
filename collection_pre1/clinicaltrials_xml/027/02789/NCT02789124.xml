	<brief_summary>Difficulties accurate assessment intravascular volume critically ill patient frequently encounter . In addition clinical evaluation , bedside echocardiographic measurement fluid responsiveness technically difficult , especially critically ill mechanically ventilated patient . The carotid artery easily accessible structure amenable bedside ultrasonography perform Intensivists .

	<brief_title>Diagnostic Value Passive Leg Raise Induced Changes Carotid Artery Flow Time Predict Fluid Responsiveness Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Predicting fluid responsiveness Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) difficult task . Clearly , early aggressive resuscitation patient severe sepsis septic shock improve outcomes . Conversely , overzealous fluid administration associate increased mortality patient septic shock acute lung injury . However , recent study challenge conventional wisdom clinical exam , central venous pressure ( CVP ) , pulmonary artery occlusion pressure ( PAOP ) able predict volume status fluid responsiveness . Only approximately 50 % ICU patient show respond volume expansion study design examine fluid responsiveness.9 Ideally , Intensivists would access cheap , reliable , continuously operate , non-invasive , user friendly device fluid could administer patient long fluid responsive . Stroke volume could maximize via Frank-Starling relationship resuscitation potential deleterious effect could avoid . Although measurement thermodilution cardiac output Pulmonary Artery Catheter ( PAC ) consider `` gold standard '' new device validate , wan role modern ICUs . Existing technology Esophageal Doppler , Transpulmonary Indicator Dilution , Arterial-Pressure-Waveform-Derived method , invasive PAC , still invasive procedure . Echocardiography excellent tool , however assess fluid responsiveness require advanced train beyond qualitative approach difficult obtain optimal window critically ill patient . Thus , current method assessment fluid responsiveness suboptimal . The use Carotid Doppler determine volume responsiveness recently propose . Remarkably , author find increase carotid blood flow 20 % predict fluid responsiveness sensitivity 94 % specificity 86 % . This appear attractive option , caveat point care ultrasound machine currently available software capability calculate carotid artery velocity time integral ( VTI ) method validate use Bioreactance , reliability recently question . A simple method evaluate carotid artery fluid responsiveness , Carotid Flow Time , recently discuss popular ultrasound podcast , yet validate clinical study . The Carotid Artery Corrected Flow Time ( FTC ) concept new . In fact , well study marker preload afterload Transesophageal Doppler ( TED ) . TED monitor display wave form velocity versus time similar image one might obtain pulsed wave Doppler ( PWD ) carotid artery . With TED , waveform triangular appearance . The apex triangle represent peak velocity , along mean acceleration reflect cardiac contractility . The area systolic portion curve equal stroke distance , multiply cross sectional area descend aorta value use estimate cardiac output predicate assumption descend aorta receives 70 % cardiac output . The investigator interested base triangle represent systolic ejection time . When corrected heart rate divide square root cardiac cycle time FTC . The FTC would expect increase enhance preload reduction afterload ; conversely decrease reduction preload increase afterload . One study perform 20 neurosurgical patient TED show FTC able predict fluid responsiveness use static measure cutoff 357 m prior load 7 ml/kg hydroxyethyl starch solution . The area receiver operate curve ( ROC ) 0.944 . The investigator believe concept FTC marker preload combine conveniently PWD carotid artery passive leg raise maneuver ( PLR ) estimate fluid responsiveness critically ill patient . The method attractive due ease access carotid artery , reproducibility , low cost , since FTC measurement time ( velocity ) , angle insonation inconsequential , make exam technically easy perform compare carotid artery VTI . This compare 10 % increase SVI follow PLR demonstrate Flotrac/Vigileo consider `` gold standard '' . While absolute value cardiac output obtain Flotrac/Vigileo compare PAC debatable , ability device track change cardiac output/stroke volume response change preload PLR show accurate.16-19 A meta-analysis publish Cavallaro colleague show PLR induce change cardiac output able predict fluid responsiveness sensitivity specificity 89.4 % 91.4 % pooled area ROC value 0.95 regardless ventilation mode , underlie cardiac rhythm , technique measurement . Thus , increase SVI &gt; 10 % PLR detect Flotrac/Vigileo monitor without need fluid bolus , sufficient determine whether PLR induce change carotid FTC able detect fluid responsiveness .</detailed_description>
