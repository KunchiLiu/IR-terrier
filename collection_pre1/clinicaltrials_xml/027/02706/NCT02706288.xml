	<brief_summary>The purpose study understand weight loss low fat plant-based diet exercise program affect metabolic cardiovascular health overweight adult high risk disease . Outcome measure include assessment insulin sensitivity , β-cell function , body fat distribution , skeletal muscle adipose tissue biology , cardiovascular function , cardiorespiratory fitness , muscular strength , immune function , gut microbiome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Calorie Restricted , Very Low Fat Plant-based Diet Multi-component Exercise Program Metabolic Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reduced energy intake increase physical activity profound effect cardiometabolic health assess insulin sensitivity , β-cell function , serum lipid , intra-abdominal fat mass , intrahepatic triglyceride content , blood pressure , cornerstone treatment people obesity . However , specific additional therapeutic effect regular exercise conjunction diet-induced weight loss clear . In addition , optimal dietary macronutrient composition need reduce cardiometabolic risk know . The use low fat , plant-based ( PB ) diet become increasingly popular treat people obesity diet therapy reimburse Medicare treatment people coronary heart disease . Participants undergo nutritional counseling supervise exercise training 4 day per week 7-10 % weight loss achieve . Meals provide food diary keep weight loss . Tests intervention include muscular strength aerobic fitness , cardiovascular assessment , glucose tolerance test , hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp test insulin sensitivity , heavy water metabolism , rest energy expenditure/metabolic rate , muscle fat biopsy , body composition scan , blood test , urine stool collection . The overarch goal project conduct comprehensive characterization weight loss induce use PB diet regular exercise people MAO , follow comparison effect study another study evaluate effect amount weight loss induce use PB diet alone , without exercise . Specifically , evaluate change body composition , body fat distribution , cardiopulmonary function , muscle strength , plasma metabolome , insulin sensitivity , beta-cell function , systemic adipose tissue inflammation immune system function , adipose tissue muscle cellular metabolic pathway , gut microbiome determine cellular , multiorgan , whole-body effect PB diet alone PB diet plus exercise . Accordingly , study fill two important gap knowledge considerable physiological clinical significance ; data study provide : 1 ) good understanding effect PB diet plus exercise series key outcome measure , 2 ) potential additional benefit add regular exercise PB diet .</detailed_description>
