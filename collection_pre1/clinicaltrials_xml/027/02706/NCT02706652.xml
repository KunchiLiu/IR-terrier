	<brief_summary>Background : People 's genetic marker genetic characteristic affect response drug therapy . Researchers want screen people marker characteristic . They want people screen study National Cancer Institute . That save time lose people go whole screening study find join . The data collect may also use select proper dose anticancer agent study . Objective : To screen people genetic marker and/or baseline characteristic . These used determine enroll clinical trial . They may also use select proper dose anticancer agent test . Eligibility : Adults 18 old consider treated National Cancer Institute study Design : Participants blood draw genetic test . Some participant cheek swab . Participants genetic data store future research . It could share researcher ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Genetic sequence drug-metabolizing enzyme , transporters/receptors , transcription factor , drug target , patient baseline characteristic often affect individual response drug therapy . Expression gene also influence epigenome regulation variety factor : RNA expression , protein expression , disease state , comorbidities , concomitant therapy , etc . Therefore , inter-patient variability drug pharmacokinetics outcome often function factor . - Inter-individual difference efficacy toxicity cancer chemotherapy especially important give narrow therapeutic index drug . - During analysis investigational agent , inter-individual variability pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , clinical outcome , toxicity often note . Many difference potentially clinically actionable depend aforementioned marker . Objectives : - To screen patient genomic marker , epigenomic marker , RNA marker , protein marker , and/or baseline characteristic use inform either enrollment therapeutic clinical trial dose selection investigational anticancer agent . Eligibility : - All individual seek enrollment National Cancer Institute clinical trial include priori assessment patient genome , epigenome , proteome , baseline characteristic eligibility criteria enrollment dose selection . Design : - This study use screen protocol enroll patient priori screen necessary inclusion IRB-approved clinical trial take place NCI . - As rationale ascertain status marker prior study inclusion present associated clinical trial , present study amend case-by-case basis . - The accrual ceiling study 900 patient .</detailed_description>
