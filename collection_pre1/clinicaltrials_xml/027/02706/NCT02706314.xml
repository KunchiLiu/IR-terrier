	<brief_summary>Critical illness ICU set high medical socioeconomic importance . Critically ill patient frequently develop severe neurologic impairment course disease , typically present critical-illness-polyneuropathy ( CIP ) , associate increased mortality rate . To date neither strategy available predict specifically treat CIP . Diagnostic test determine CIP course critical illness available nerve conduction study . Further research need find diagnostic tool identify patient high risk develop CIP , could encourage evolution new therapeutic strategy CIP patient . The aim study : 1 . An early detection change intramural neuronal network human colon sample induce human blood serum critically ill patient order predict development CIP 2 . The comparison different diagnostic test diagnose monitor CIP course critical illness ( neurologic examination versus nerve conduction study versus neuromyosonography )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient critical illness fulfil inclusion criterion screen study two surgical ICUs university hospital Rostock , Germany . The inclusion patient start write informed consent obtain participant representative ( direct consent could obtain ) . The aim study prediction earlier detection CIP critically ill patient nerve conduction study able diagnose CIP . We hypothesize upregulated circulating neurotoxic factor human serum critically ill patient cause neuronal damage play important role pathogenesis CIP . Time upregulation neurotoxic factor clinical appearance neuronal damage ( CIP ) unknown . An experimental part study aim establish enteric neuronal network functional bioassay qualitative detection neurotoxic humoral factor . Human colon sample expose serum critically ill patient without CIP organ bath ( 100 % serum ) standardize physiologic condition . Alterations neuronal function ( contraction , spontaneous activity ) study serum patient CIP , without CIP serum probe healthy volunteer ( without critical illness ) . In clinical part study critically ill patient without CIP ( detect nerve conduction study gold standard diagnosis CIP ) examine neurologic examination , nerve conduction study neuromyosonography peripheral nerve . The incidence , extent time begin critical illness clinical appearance nerval alteration compare 3 diagnostic test . From patient basic demographic data , illness severity score ( APACHE-II , SOFA ) laboratory result , pre-morbidity data clinical outcome study cohort record . At day 3 10 patient examine neurologic examination , nerve conduction study , neuromyosonography laboratory test ( inflammation , coagulation , organ function , blood parameter include TNF-alpha , IL-6 , S100b , oxidative stress marker , neurofilaments , C-type natriuretic peptide ) .</detailed_description>
