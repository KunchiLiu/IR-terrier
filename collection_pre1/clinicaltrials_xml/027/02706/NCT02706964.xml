	<brief_summary>Currently , distant breast metastasis diagnose , 65 % patient succumb cancer within 2 year , 80 % succumb 5 year . The current National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) Clinical Practice Guidelines Breast Cancer recommend surveillance image early detection distant metastasis , even high-risk breast cancer patient . Whereas , standard-of-care treatment small isolate ( number ) breast cancer metastases perform surgical resection locally ablative radiation therapy , however , follow-up breast cancer patient ( include &gt; = 30 % risk develop metastasis ) wait clinical symptom appear use dual positron emission tomography ( PET ) diagnostic quality compute tomography ( CT ) PET/CT scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , compute tomography ( CT ) bone scan identify site extent spread . Unfortunately , metastases become symptomatic often large and/or numerous treat curative intent . The current national care guideline advocate intensive surveillance distant metastasis base two study perform Italy 1985-1993 conclude available imaging treatment tool day prolong 5-year survival . Since , however , major improvement image treatment technology . To treatable metastasis must limit number limited size , typically 6 few metastasis , size 5 centimeter less . This state metastatic presentation call oligometastases . Numerous pilot study achieve dramatically improve overall disease-free survival oligometastases treat use combine systemic plus locally-ablative therapy oligometastasis . A scientific concern aforementioned research study involve ablation isolate oligometastases , carry consistent use surveillance imaging . Instead , study effectively preselected patient enrollment base upon exist oligometastatic presentation . The primary objective research study : ( 1 ) determine feasibility state intervention multi-institutional setting ; ( 2 ) document pattern early metastatic spread breast cancer ; ( 3 ) document proportion high-risk breast cancer patient oligometastatic presentation within proactive imaging protocol , ( 4 ) provide basis determine optimize future surveillance imaging protocol respect time progression , rate tumor growth organ affect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All enrol subject undergo single whole-body dual positron emission tomography ( PET ) diagnostic quality compute tomography ( CT ) PET/CT scan CT scan contrast acquire imaging session ; single brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan contrast complete separate imaging session within 2 week PET/CT scan . Imaging take place within 7 month enrollment . In addition , medical record relate breast cancer care , obtain maintain per standard-of-care , monitor 5 year . In research study investigator acquire PET/CT image body ( neck mid-thigh ) use best-practice diagnostic imaging protocol , typically involve 64-slice CT system , 1x1x3 mm voxel dimension , use non-ionic contrast agent , breath-holding motion correction . Subjects also receive single MRI inject contrast brain use best-practice diagnostic imaging protocol , typically involve 3-Tesla clinical MRI system .</detailed_description>
