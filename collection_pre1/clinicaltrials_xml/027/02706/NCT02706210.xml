	<brief_summary>Dementia one main chronic non-communicable disease associate disability , institutionalization , mortality among elderly individual . Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) vascular dementia ( VD ) consider main type dementia . A widely share view future treatment strategy need focus treatment early stage disease . Mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) constitute intermediate stage normal age dementia . Vascular cognitive disorder ( VCD ) umbrella term represent wide spectrum cognitive disorder evoke associated vascular cause . It encompass patient suffer range type cognitive impairment , mild impairment VD . VCD predementia ( VCD-P ) stage MCI . Amnestic MCI ( aMCI ) subtype MCI , also consider clinical transition stage normal age AD , apply detect emerge dementia . In VCD , infarcts profuse white matter disease consider cause cognitive decline . By contrast , AD one common progressive neurodegenerative disorder think cause amyloid aggregation formation tau tangle . Both VCD-P aMCI deficit cognitive domain , may chief complaint memory deficit . If clear turn type dementia patient cognitive impairment stage , make u early intervention treatment patient , also save lot social resource economic cost clinic . By apply rest state functional magnetic resonance ( fMRI ) , structural magnetic resonance imaging ( sMRI ) diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging ( DTI ) multimodal magnetic resonance ( NMR ) technology , project comprehensive analysis comparison neurodegenerative blood vessel brain function patient mild cognitive impairment structural abnormality connection mode . This project order reveal cognitive impairment disease neural circuit development network connection change rule . People understand pathogenesis cognitive impairment , discover new provide scientific basis prevention , diagnosis treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator use psychological test neuroimage compare difference two group . All participant receive battery neuropsychological test assess general mental status cognitive domain , include visual-spatial ability , executive function , language , memory , attention , general intellectual ability . These test include CDR scale , Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) , clock draw test ( CDT ) , Auditory Verbal Learning Test ( AVLT ) , activity daily live scale ( ADL ) Hamilton Depression Scale HIS . All evaluation perform two attend neurologist . All participant scan 3.0 T Siemens scanner within single session . Each participant receive magnetization prepare rapidly acquire gradient echo ( MPRAGE ) T1-weighted scan ( repetition time [ TR ] , 1900 m ; echo time [ TE ] , 2.2 m ; inversion time , 900 m ; matrix , 256×256 ; number excitation , 1 ; thickness , 1 mm ; 176 slice ) Resting state functional image collect use echo-planar imaging ( EPI ) sequence follow parameter : repetition time ( TR ) = 2000 m ; echo time ( TE ) =40 m ; flip angle=90° ; number slices=28 ; slice thickness=4 mm ; gap=1 mm ; voxel size=4×4×4 mm3 ; matrix=64×64 . Participants ask lie quietly scanner eye close data acquisition . This scan last 478 s. For subject , first five volume discard allow T1 equilibration effect adaptation subject circumstance , leave 234 image analysis . The diffusion weight image scan acquire 3.0T Siemens Tim Trio MRI scanner . Three diffusion echo-planar imaging sequence one zero-weighted image ( b =0 s/mm2 ) thirty diffusion sensitize orientation ( b =1000 s/mm2 ) use follow specification : slice thickness=2 mm ; 90 slice ; repetition time = 11000 m ; echo time = 98 m ; voxel size = 2 mm isotropic ; flip angle=90° ; acquisition matrix = 128 mm×116 mm .</detailed_description>
