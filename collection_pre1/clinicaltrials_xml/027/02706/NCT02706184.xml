	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy use frequently treat tumor . For many kind tumor , chemotherapy effective way treatment . Besides desired effect neoplastic cell , cytotoxic effect often lead undesirable effect cell . Particularly epithelial tissue gastrointestinal tract affect , mucositis diarrhea occur . By loss water electrolyte , diarrhea often make delay chemotherapy necessary . Besides mucositis , chemotherapy also cause change gut microbiota animal model proof . It well know , probiotic shorten diarrhea . So far , use probiotic chemotherapy patient investigate one single study . Severity diarrhea reduce compare placebo . Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 ( EcN ) well investigate probiotic . In cell culture , supernatant EcN reduce noxious effect 5-Fluoruracil concerning cell toxicity disruption barrier function . Therefore , aim study whether patient gastric colorectal cancer , treatment 5-Fluoruracil combination chemotherapeutic remedy ( FLO , FOLFOX , FOLFOX-Bev , FOLFIRI ) plan , EcN-Suspension capable reduce duration intensity chemotherapy induce diarrhea .</detailed_description>
