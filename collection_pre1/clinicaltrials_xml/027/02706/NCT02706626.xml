	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness investigational drug , brigatinib ( AP261136 ) patient advance non-small cell lung cancer Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) first-line treatment cancer still get bad , even , take drug call ALK inhibitor , anti-cancer drug act tumor . Some example anti-cancer drug : KEYTRUDA® ALECENSA® ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Brigatinib After Treatment With Second-Generation ALK Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A significant population Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase ( ALK ) plus Non-small cell lung cancer patient exist progressed intolerant second generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor ( e.g . ceritinib alectinib ) . Brigatinib demonstrate activity patient progress crizotinib , activity brigatinib patient progress ceritinib , alectinib , second generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor unknown . Based preclinical data . 3 , brigatinib know anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor potent activity know secondary anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutation suggest may retain activity third-line treatment anaplastic lymphoma kinase plus disease . Patients enrol ARI-AT-002 must previously receive second generation Anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor brigatinib . Given third-line treatment anaplastic lymphoma kinase plus disease analogous phase I population , choose 20 % clinically meaningful response rate would justify study brigatinib previously treat anaplastic lymphoma kinase plus disease .</detailed_description>
