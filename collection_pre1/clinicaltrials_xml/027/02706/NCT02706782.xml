	<brief_summary>Pancreatic carcinoma typically high recurrence rate poor prognosis . Surgery best choice treatment pancreatic cancer , advance pancreatic cancer patients，when surgery available，chemotherapy combine radiation therapy interventional therapy commonly use treatment，but prolong survival effect obvious . And , clinical researcher use CAR-T cell treatment pancreatic carcinoma , accord exist result , therapeutic effect good expecting . One likely reason continue use intravenous infuse CART cell patient , T cell blood circulation , result decrease tumor activity potential adverse effect . We believe suitable TAA targeted-CAR-T cell effective way treat cancer , long pathway cell infuse body improve drug concentration tumor site reduce potential off-target side effect . In order achieve goal , probably best choice use vascular intervention mediate CAR-T cell infusion . Mesothelin cell-surface antigen implicate tumor invasion , highly express pancreatic carcinoma low-level express mesothelia . We design 2nd CART cell target mesothelin , use vascular intervention mediate CAR-T infusion patient . We hope deliver anti-mesothelin CART cell locally reduce side effect enhance antitumor affect CART cell accumulate tumor site less reach normal mesothelial tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Mesothelin Redirected Autologous T Cells Advanced Pancreatic Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct assess vascular interventional therapy mediate anti-mesothelin-CAR-T ( meso-CAR-T ) cell safety efficacy treat patient advanced pancreatic carcinoma.The investigator construct 2nd CAR , use mesothelin target , use 4-1BB co-stimulator . The source T cell use prepare CAR-T autologous . The infusion dose ( 1-10 ) ×106 meso-CAR positive T cells/kg , specific cell number depend situation individual CAR-T cell preparation . The infusion way vascular interventional mediate , would undergo cannula -- DSA radiography -- CAR-T cell perfusion . The cell perfusion process would last 15min 2 h , specific time depend patent 's tumor-burdened state .</detailed_description>
