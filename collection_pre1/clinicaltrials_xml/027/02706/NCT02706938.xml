	<brief_title>Impact Head Bed Elevation Symptoms Patients With Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROBLEM STATEMENT Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) clinical condition characterize troublesome symptom medical complication result reflux gastric content esophagus . GERD diagnose 4 % primary care outpatient visit disease prevalence Latin-America reach 12-31 % . Nocturnal symptom find 74 % patient GERD cause significant quality life impairment , compare general population patient GERD daytime-only symptom . Sleep interference secondary nocturnal retrosternal burning associate low work productivity , even patient treat proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) . Due several physiological factor lack conscious perception symptom , reduce salivation lower frequency nocturnal swallowing , significantly longer acid exposure overnight associate emergence complication like esophagitis , extra-esophageal symptom illness asthma . As low-cost non pharmacological anti-reflux treatment GERD , head bed elevation ( HBE ) nowadays moderate-strength recommendation low level evidence . Clinical impact measure patient night-time symptom remain unknown , due inconsistent result methodological limitation among different clinical trial ; perform widespread use proton pump inhibitor clinical practice . Evidence several non-randomized study suggest HBE could reduce esophageal acid exposure time could decrease GERD symptom ; however , another study find significant difference outcomes . On hand , randomize control clinical trial publish far show inconsistent result . A study publish widely accepted clinical use PPI , reveal significant clinical endoscopic improvement HBE patient GERD grade C-D esophagitis , compare control . In contrast , multi-centre clinical trial find difference symptom score antacid use among group allocate HBE control group . All cite study methodological limitation heterogeneity outcome assessment , make difficult conduct meta-analysis data . No published study evaluate impact HBE quality life work productivity find . SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION Sample size estimate base hypothesis HBE would produce difference least 10 % RDQ SF-36 score . Effect size ( Cohen ) calculate 0,49 , keep mind RDQ mean standard deviation 3,3±1,0 previously find Spanish population symptomatic GERD . An SF-36 mean standard deviation 56,9±20,3 report Italian population medical therapy PPI also take account . The minimally important difference selection chosen base assumption difference small 10 % would clinical relevance . Based data , 52 patient per group would yield power great 80 % detection minimally important difference large large 0,6 point RDQ questionnaire ( range : 1 6 ) 10 point SF-36 questionnaire ( range : 0 100 ) . Finally , estimate sample size incremented 20 % avoid eventual loss follow-up may alter study power . Therefore , final sample size 124 patient , 62 patient per group . DESIGN AND CARVING OF WOODEN PRISMS 124 prism wither pine tree wood dimension 20x18x18 cm carve 9 log 300x20x20 cm Aserrío San Ignacio Ltda . production plant , locate Soacha , Cundinamarca . Given industrial process chainsaw cut wood planing , quality control implement consist verification prism stability lie floor , mean height millimeter every prism also measure register . Unsteady product atypical mean height , define height either exceed percentile 75 + 1,5 time interquartile range percentile 25 - 1,5 time interquartile range , discard use study . After exclusion defective prism , n group wooden prism pair accord mean height millimeter form every group give random digit generate computer . Afterwards , every random digit prism group sequentially assign consecutive HBE-allocated patient number , way every consecutive patient number ( among allocate HBE ) link randomly preset know prism height . This additional randomization procedure involve prism accord mean height , plan due impossibility guarantee prism height identical precision ±1 mm , keep mind product cut chainsaw plan part industrial process . RANDOMIZATION A random binomial number list ( zeroes one ) generate statistical software SPSS 16.0 Windows list use allocation 124 patient intervention control group 1:1 proportion . Each one 62 pair wooden prism mark consecutive number come HBE-allocated patient prism store keep marked number reach sight researcher charge patient recruiting . Patients meet inclusion criterion , exclusion criterion give write informed consent , assign consecutive number outpatient visit accord order inclusion trial . These participant randomize either HBE control group moment member research team verifies , among stored prism , existence prism pair mark number consecutive number assign patient . In case pair exist , patient take home pair wooden prism use first period trial accord spoken write instruction give moment . On contrary , pair wooden prism mark consecutive number patient , exist , understood study participant allocate control group first period trial . The member research team verifies storehouse wooden prism charge confirm inclusion exclusion criterion assign consecutive number patient outpatient visit . ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT The researcher charge confirm inclusion exclusion criterion , fulfil Basic Data Formulary provide patient Informed Consent Format , aware allocation sequence order 3 document apply participant consecutive number generate accord order inclusion trial . After , member research team prism storehouse verify existence prism pair mark number consecutive number assign patient , point allocation status participant know . CROSS-OVER After allocation complete , patient intervention group receive pair number wooden prism dimension 20x18x18 cm along write instruction correct use intervention . The patient must sleep HBE 6 week RDQ SF-36 questionnaire apply end first period participant still sleep HBE . Afterwards , washout 2 week period follow participant sleep HBE stop use return pair wooden prism researcher . After washout period end RDQ SF-36 questionnaire apply , patient allocate control group first period study receive random pair prism instruct use prism sleep HBE second period 6 week . Meanwhile , participant initially allocate HBE group follow control group second period study . BLINDING Because HBE susceptible double-blinding , patient allocate intervention group always aware group belong . However , researcher charge statistical analysis data write result report work random-generated alphabetical group code mask intervention one periods trial . FOLLOW-UP After participant allocation , telephonic follow make period trial frequency dependent intervention group patient period . Participants HBE group call weekly 2 week , call biweekly month , period 6 week end . In contrast , patient control group call every three week along period . With purpose verify HBE adherence correct use wooden prism , every participant ask send photograph bed head legs follow-up telephone call . The photograph receive researcher via e-mail smart-phone encode saved hard disk . At end first period , RDQ SF-36 questionnaire apply researcher store return prism washout period . When washout period end , RDQ SF-36 questionnaire apply order sure absence carry-over effect group initially allocate HBE . Finally week 14 , RDQ , SF-36 Patient Preference questionnaire administer complete study end outcome assessment . STATISTIC ANALYSIS PLAN Quantitative qualitative variable collect Basic Data Format , RDQ , SF-36 Patient Preference questionnaires type Microsoft Excel 2007 database . Intervention group mask alphabetical code provide independent collaborator involve data analysis report write . For statistical processing , database import SPSS 16.0 Windows descriptive statistic generate variable . Statistically significant difference search categorical data use Chi-square test normality test numerical continuous variable use Shapiro-Wilk test . For normally distribute continuous variable , statistically significant difference search use unpaired Student 's test . Alternatively , normally distribute variable Wilcoxon sign rank test apply . For complementary processing primary outcome secondary outcome quality life , score difference period transform binomial variable McNemar test apply . Differences one-tail p &lt; 0,05 accept statistically significant . Subgroup analysis explore difference stratify accord age group , sex , ethnic group , BMI , comorbidities , cup coffee per day , pharmacological adherence , length severity symptom .</detailed_description>
