	<brief_summary>This Phase I , single center , two-part , randomize , open label , cross-over study . Part 1 study evaluate PK , safety , tolerability GSK525762 administer alone co-administered follow repeat dose itraconazole , know strong inhibitor Cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) Para-glycoprotein ( Pgp ) inhibitor . Part 1 consist 2 Cohorts preliminary PK safety data obtain Cohort 1 inform Cohort 2 . Part 2 ( one Cohort ) study evaluate PK , safety , tolerability GSK525762 administer alone co-administered follow repeat dose rifampicin , know potent inducer CYP3A4 . In vitro inhibition data indicate CYP3A4 may major route clearance GSK525762 co-administration drug therapy modulate CYP3A4 ( i.e.CYP3A4 inhibitor inducer ) likely alter exposure GSK525762 ( i.e . increase decrease exposure , respectively ) . The data generate current study justify exclusion criterion concomitant medication affect CYP3A4 Pgp also inform potential dose modification case co-administration medication affect CYP3A4 activity . All subject undergo screen visit within 28 day first dose study drug follow one treatment period follow-up visit 7-10 day last dose GSK525762 . Subjects Part 1 participate study 45 day subject Part 2 participate 56 day .</brief_summary>
