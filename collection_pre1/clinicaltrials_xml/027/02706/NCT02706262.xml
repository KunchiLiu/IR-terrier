	<detailed_description>Obesity associate constellation cardiometabolic abnormality ( include insulin resistance , elevate blood pressure dyslipidemia ) risk factor diabetes cardiovascular disease . However , people experience typical `` complication '' associate obesity . Approximately 25 % obese people protect adverse metabolic effect excess fat accumulation consider metabolically-normal , base normal response insulin . The mechanism responsible development insulin resistance cardiometabolic complication , , obese person unknown . In people develop typical `` complication '' associate obesity weight loss profound therapeutic effect . Currently , three distinctly different type diet demonstrate considerable benefit improve cardiometabolic health lean obese people : 1 ) Mediterranean diet , 2 ) low-carbohydrate , ketogenic diet , 3 ) plant-based , very-low-fat diet . However , considerable inter-individual variability body weight loss among people response give diet , known people lose weight one diet another . The mechanisms responsible different weight metabolic response specific type diet independent effect weight loss dietary macronutrient composition cardiometabolic health unclear . The overarch goal project therefore fill gap knowledge conduct careful cross-sectional characterization metabolically normal lean , metabolically normal obese metabolically abnormal obese individual compare body composition , body fat distribution , plasma metabolome , systemic adipose tissue inflammation immune system function , adipose tissue muscle biological function , gut microbiome , brain 's structure , cognitive function central reward mechanism , taste sensation group . . Metabolically abnormal obese participant randomize follow Mediterranean , low-carbohydrate ketogenic plant-based , very-low-fat diet examine different effect diet outcomes purpose determine beneficial potentially harmful effect different diet .</detailed_description>
