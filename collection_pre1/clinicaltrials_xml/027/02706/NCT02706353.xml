	<brief_title>APX005M Combination With Systemic Pembrolizumab Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 4 group 3 participant enrol Part 1 , 20 participant enrol Part 2 . If enrol Part 1 , dose APX005M receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level APX005M . Each new group receive high dose APX005M group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose APX005M find . If enrol Part 2 , receive APX005M high dose tolerate Phase 1 All participant receive dose level pembrolizumab . Study Drug Administration : APX005M inject directly 1 tumor every 3 week ( Weeks 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 ) 4 dos . The injection may do without help ultrasound , CT , MRI . If doctor think need , may need stay hospital overnight monitor caregiver 24 hour receive APX005M . You receive pembrolizumab vein 1 time every 3 week ( Weeks 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 ) . The first dose pembrolizumab give 1-2 day first dose APX005M . You give diary write injection site reaction may . Study Visits : Within 1 week first APX005M injection : - You physical exam . - You punch biopsy image-guided biopsy tumor check status disease . To collect biopsy , area skin numb anesthetic small cut make remove part affected tissue . To collect punch biopsy , area skin numb anesthetic small cut make remove part affected tissue . To perform image-guided biopsy , needle insert affected area use image CT ultrasound collect cell tissue organ , lymph node , suspect tumor mass . The doctor use image guide needle area . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - The tumor measure photograph . On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test test immune system . - The tumor measure photograph . On Days 2 3 Cycle 1 : - Your vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) measure . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - You biopsy one injected tumor site within 48 hour 1st injection check status disease . On Days 8 15 Cycles 1 2 : - Your vital sign measure . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 2-4 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test test immune system . On Day 1 Cycle 3 ( ± 3 day ) : - You biopsy one injected tumor one tumor injection check status disease . - The tumor measure photograph . - You CT , MRI/CT , and/or ultrasound check status disease . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 5 beyond : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - You CT , MRI/CT , and/or ultrasound check status disease . On Day 1 Cycle 5 ( ± 3 day ) every 3-4 cycle : - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test test immune system . - The tumor measure photograph . - You CT , MRI/CT , and/or ultrasound check status disease . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Length Treatment : You study 2 year . You take study disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . If doctor think benefit , may continue receive pembrolizumab standard care study . Your doctor describe detail . Off-Study Visit : If go study early disease get worse intolerable side effect : - You physical exam . - The tumor photograph measure . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test test immune system . - You CT scan check status disease . Follow-Up : Within 2 week last study drug dose every 8-12 week , scan check status disease . Your doctor decide type scan . If choose seek care another hospital , study staff call every 3 month 2 year last study drug dose . You ask . The call last 5 minute . This investigational study . APX005M FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Pembrolizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment metastatic melanoma . The combination drug treat metastatic melanoma investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 41 participant treat study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
