	<detailed_description>Because possible advantage SBRT conventional radiation , investigator begin small pilot study test new treatment technique set resectable soft tissue sarcoma . The pilot study plan total 12 patient felt good number gauge expansion technology would successful . As 2/6/2015 13 participant enrol ( two enrol patient decline treatment protocol thus total 11 patient treat protocol ) . As time , investigator see Grade 3 high toxicity instance local failure . There several distant failure would relate local therapy like SBRT anything , SBRT reduce instance distant failure shorten time chemotherapy . The following represent initial experience SBRT STS ( manuscript submit publication ) . Note abstract 8 participant treat pilot study 5 participant treat prior pilot study opening ( one instance local failure patient treat pre-protocol ) . In term patient number goal 33 patient cohorts one two . Using historical control late toxicity rate 40 % late toxicity rate initial population 20 % alpha 0.1 ( reasonable phase II study , alpha 0.05 typical phase III study ) would 80 % power detect difference 33 patient . The expectation phase II study include follow 1 . Late toxicity 30 % less 2 . Local control rate 90 % good These number base historical control previous research . Local control rate historical series 90 % good also hold true initial phase II study . For late toxicity rate , historical control 35-43 % ( The NCI study use similar wound complication definition u well power study wound complication rate 43 % ) . The investigator feel study promise enough large phase III non-inferiority study current phase II study late toxicity rate 30 % good local control rate 90 % good .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All cohort : Age &gt; 18 Patients childbearing age must agree contraception radiosurgery complete . Note patient metastatic disease eligible protocol Cohort 1 : Soft tissue sarcoma ( histology subtype ) patient plan preoperative radiation follow surgical resection Anatomical site include upper extremity ( include shoulder ) low extremity ( include hip ) Patient performance status comorbid condition allow surgical resection Cohort 2 : soft tissue sarcoma ( histologic subtype ) postresection plan additional surgery . Patients must high risk feature require postoperative radiation include Large tumor ( &gt; 5 cm ) , High grade , Previous unplanned , non , oncologic surgery , Close margin Anatomical site include upper extremity ( include shoulder ) low extremity ( include hip ) Cohort 3 : soft tissue sarcoma ( histologic subtype ) amenable surgical resection reason Anatomical site include upper extremity ( include shoulder ) low extremity ( include hip pelvis ) Patients plan surgical resection Note retroperitoneal sarcoma eligible Tumors fit criterion cohort</criteria>
