	<brief_summary>The objective study compare evaluate efficacy subcutaneous ( 40mg ) adalimumab biweekly injection intravitreal adalimumab ( 1.5 mg/ 0.03 mL ) administration , give zero , 2 week every four week , subject active non-infectious intermediate- , posterior- , pan-uveitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravitreal Adalimumab Versus Subcutaneous Adalimumab Non-infectious Uveitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subject group : 32 subject enrol study , 16 arm . They randomize receive either 1.5 mg/ 0.03 mL adalimumab intravitreal injection 40 mg adalimumab subcutaneously first treatment visit 2 week visit eligible repeat injection . Follow every 2 day first week one week later every 4-week interval total 26 week . Intervention Details : - Systemic adalimumab : Subcutaneous injection 40 mg adalimumab ( Humira ) give every 2 week . - Local adalimumab : Intravitreal injection 1.5mg/0.03ml adalimumab give zero , 2 week , every 4 week . Pre-treatment work Patients undergo comprehensive eye exam : - Visual acuity , slit-lamp examination anterior segment , dilate fundus examination , electroretinography ( ERG ) fluorescein angiography ( FA ) . - Central macular thickness eye measure ocular coherence tomography treatment . - Purified Protein Derivative ( PPD ) , Complete blood count ( CBC ) SGPT . Post-injection follow-up - Patients follow every 2 day first week one week later every 4-week interval . - On follow visit , deterioration vision two ETDRS line worsen ocular inflammation 1+ cells/haze detect visit , patient remove study receive appropriate treatment . Otherwise , vision stable improve and/or inflammation well , patient re-injected . - Follow 26 week . - OCT fluorescein angiography visit . - ERG perform baseline 26 week . - Blood study ( CBC SGPT ) perform baseline , 14 week 26 week . - Injections would delay patient acute infection would give subsides .</detailed_description>
