	<brief_summary>Background : DNA tell body grow function . Williams-Beuren syndrome ( WS ) Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis ( SVAS ) rare disease cause change part person DNA . Symptoms condition include vascular problem include narrow blood vessel supravalvular aortic stenosis ( SVAS ) supravalvular pulmonary stenosis . Individuals WS may also developmental challenge personality difference . Researchers NIH want find people WS SVAS severe symptom . They want collect sample data see DNA environmental change affect severity disease . Objective : To identify DNA difference environmental change change severity WS SVAS person person . Eligibility : People age 0 85 either WS , SVAS , and/or SVAS-like condition Children people WS must parent legal guardian consent help answer question . Design : Participants screen question medical history . Participants 60-minute visit . They provide blood saliva sample . They parent/guardian : Answer question WS SVAS affect . Sign form release medical record study . If participant regular doctor recommend surgery , researcher ask surgeon skin tissue sample might otherwise discard . These used create stem cell study lab . For 20 year , participant annual questionnaire phone , email , mail WS SVAS . Participants may also contact : They need provide new blood saliva sample . Researchers need data . There follow-up study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Williams Syndrome ( WS ) Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis ( SVAS ) DNA Tissue Bank</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our goal Williams syndrome ( WS ) Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis ( SVAS ) , deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) Tissue Bank collect enough sample individual rare condition ask question gene cause many WS SVAS relate phenotype , determine genetic environmental change modify severity disease person person . In addition , would like learn natural history condition environmental genetic signature associate symptom presence . The protocol detail provide collection historical information , laboratory image data , DNA tissue perform study future . Because technology change rapidly rare condition , goal generate collection available analysis many year . In addition DNA tissue collection propose , would like begin use specimen collect continue ask question modifier vascular disease severity well effect organ system WS SVAS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : We recruit individual WS , SVAS , SVASlike condition . Children adult participate study part WS group must : age 0 85 presume confirm diagnosis WS parent/guardian available provide consent assist answer medical question Children adult participate study part SVAS group must : age 0 85 clinical feature suggestive SVAS SVASlike condition OR clinical feature SVAS SVASlike condition genetic testing result imply affected status ( SVAS decrease penetrance ) . parent/guardian available provide consent assist answer medical question minor ( applicable adult )</criteria>
