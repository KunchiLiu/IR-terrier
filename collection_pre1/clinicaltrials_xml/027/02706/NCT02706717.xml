	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether probiotic Visbiome Extra Strength reduce inflammation HIV-infected men woman compare placebo ( inactive medication like dummy pill ) . The study evaluate whether take Visbiome Extra Strength mouth 24 week safe well-tolerated HIV-infected person antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . Probiotics germ yeast bacteria find food supplement use improve health digestive system . Many people refer probiotic `` helpful bacteria . '' These bacteria live body help body work normally . In medical condition , include HIV infection , helpful bacteria replace bacteria change normal intestinal function increase inflammation . The investigaors test whether give probiotic restore normal intestinal function decrease inflammation .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>HIV1 infection , document licensed rapid HIV test HIV enzyme chemiluminescence immunoassay ( E/CIA ) test kit time prior study entry confirm licensed Western blot second antibody test method initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA , HIV1 antigen , plasma HIV1 RNA viral load . NOTE : The term `` license '' refers US FDAapproved kit . WHO ( World Health Organization ) CDC ( Centers Disease Control Prevention ) guideline mandate confirmation initial test result must use test different one use initial assessment . A reactive initial rapid test confirm either another type rapid assay E/CIA base different antigen preparation and/or different test principle ( eg , indirect versus competitive ) , Western blot plasma HIV1 RNA viral load . Currently continuous antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) ≥48 week prior study entry change ART regimen within 24 week prior study entry except noted . NOTE A : Continuous ART define continuous ART 48week period prior study entry ART interruption longer 7 consecutive day . NOTE B : Modifications ART 24 week prior study entry permit certain circumstance . For example , change formulation ( eg , standard formulation fixeddose combination include ART modification switch ritonavir cobicistatboosted protease inhibitor tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tenofovir alafenamide ) allow within 24 week prior study entry . A withinclass , singledrug substitution ( eg , switch nevirapine efavirenz atazanavir darunavir ) allow within 24 week prior study entry , exception switch NRTI to/from abacavir . No change ART within 24 week prior study entry permit . No plan change ART regimen study duration . Screening CD4+ cell count &gt; 200 cells/mm3 obtain within 45 day prior study entry US laboratory CLIA certification equivalent . Screening HIV1 RNA level &lt; 50 copies/mL use FDAapproved assay perform laboratory CLIA certification equivalent within 45 day prior study entry . HIV1 RNA level limit quantification use FDAapproved assay quantification limit 50 copies/mL low least 48 week prior study entry perform laboratory CLIA certification equivalent . NOTE : Single determination assay quantification limit 500 copies/mL ( ie , `` blip '' ) allow long preceding subsequent determination level quantification . The screen value may serve subsequent undetectable value follow blip . The following laboratory value obtain within 45 day prior entry US laboratory CLIA certification equivalent : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1000/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥10.0 g/dL men 9.0 g/dL woman Platelet count ≥50,000/mm3 Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ( SGOT ) ≤5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ( SGPT ) ≤5 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤5 x upper limit normal ULN Total bilirubin ≤2.5 x ULN ( atazanavir ≤5 x ULN ) Calculated creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) &gt; 60 mL/min , estimate CockcroftGault equation . For female reproductive potential , negative serum urine pregnancy test within 45 day prior entry US clinic laboratory CLIA certification equivalent , use pointofcare ( POC ) / CLIAwaived test , networkapproved nonUS laboratory clinic operate accordance Good Clinical Laboratory Practices ( GCLP ) participate appropriate external quality assurance program . If participate sexual activity could lead pregnancy , female study participant must willing use contraceptive receive protocolspecified medication . At least one follow method MUST use : Condoms ( male female ) , without spermicidal agent Diaphragm cervical cap spermicide Intrauterine device ( IUD ) Hormonebased contraceptive Ability willingness participant legal guardian/representative provide inform consent . Initiation ART acute HIV infection . NOTE : Participants initiate ART within 6 month HIV seroconversion consider initiated acute infection exclude . Receipt antibiotic therapy within 60 day prior study entry . NOTE : Antibiotics OI prophylaxis exclusionary . Known allergy/sensitivity hypersensitivity component Visbiome Extra Strength formulation . Use investigational therapy investigational vaccine within 90 day prior study entry . Noninvestigational vaccination within 2 week prior study entry . Active drug alcohol use dependence opinion site investigator would interfere adherence study requirement . Serious illness require systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 30 day prior entry . History positive HCV antibody detectable HCV RNA plasma within 48 week prior study entry . NOTE : Persons positive HCV Ab negative plasma HCV RNA allow participate . Sites must document negative HCV RNA within 24 week study entry . History positive HBsAg within 48 week prior study entry . Liver cirrhosis , history inflammatory bowel disease , total colectomy , colon rectal anastomosis , bowel resection , current colostomy . Current diagnosis diabetes . Either breastfeed pregnant within 24 week prior study entry . OIs within 45 day prior study entry . Use follow medications/products 3 consecutive day within 60 day prior study entry : Immunosuppressives ( eg , azathioprine , corticosteroid great 20 mg per day [ physiologic replacement dose allow ] , cyclosporine , mycophenolate , intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) , interferon , sirolimus , sulfasalazine , tacrolimus ) . Immune modulators ( eg , cytokine [ eg , IL2 ] , granulocyte colony stimulate factor , growth hormone , tumor necrosis factor antagonist , thalidomide ) . Antineoplastic agent ( except topical agent skin cancer ) . Probiotics prebiotics ( supplement product ) . NOTE : Yogurt live culture allow . History lactose intolerance milk allergy . Any episode acute persistent diarrhea within 60 day prior study entry . NOTES : 1 . Diarrhea define three stool per day liquid/loose/watery take shape container . If duration loose stool meet criterion definition great 30 day , chronic diarrhea exclusionary . 2 . Acute diarrhea define 314 day duration . 3 . Persistent diarrhea define 1530 day duration . Weight loss gain 25 pound 24 week prior study entry .</criteria>
