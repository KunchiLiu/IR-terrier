	<brief_summary>With age , elderly decrease ability control postural balance accompany increase risk fall ( Berg et al , 1992 ; . Tinetti et al , 1988 ) . According previous study , show elderly 65 year fall year probability 30 % , increase age ( Skelton , &amp; Todd , 2004 ) . In view , age-related posture control become important issue modern preventive medicine family care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many clinical study develop assessment tool measurement clinical staff provide balance assessment intervention . However , factor affect postural control diverse complex , tool measurement could effectively detect risk fall . In daily living , postural control involve integration sensation , biofeedback , movement response , kinesthetic sense maintain postural stability , finally integrate neuromuscular system coordination help achieve perfect postural control . Current clinical tool use assess fall research method detect incidence fall lack effective relevant contradictory , 's difficult effectively evaluate risk fall ( Gates , et al , 2008 ) . With development postural balance issue associate age process old people , set standardized equipment , lack effective method assessment normal old people fall . In response problem , provide virtual reality interface , daily living activity gait , across obstacle activity , sit stand , able good meet desire explore issue real significance enhance researcher age , motion analysis , brain cortex activity mechanism postural control mechanism .</detailed_description>
