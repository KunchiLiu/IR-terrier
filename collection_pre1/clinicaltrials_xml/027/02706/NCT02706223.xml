Newer therapy HCV recently become much simpler initiate supervise much improve effectiveness describe propose extend role community pharmacists initiate HCV therapy alongside exist OST The SuperDOT-C study utilise exist environment relationship smooth pathway HCV therapy co-administration OST alongside anti-HCV therapy supervision pharmacist compare establish pathway referral another site treatment nurse lead ant-HCV treatment program . This new pathway may positive effect movement towards HCV cure multiple level . The planned pathway different current care point , test diagnosis adherence cure . In planned pathway , patient interacts pharmacist daily basis , compare intermittent interaction secondary care team member . The result patient shorter care pathway , less travel good access anti-HCV treatment . The daily interaction pharmacy provide opportunity assess support patient , provide sound advice care , add benefit able directly observe treatment , ( DOT ) , thus potentially improve adherence .</detailed_description>
