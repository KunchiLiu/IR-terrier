	<brief_summary>The goal study develop objective , multi-modal classification scheme outcome measure traumatic brain injury base several measure : ( 1 ) blood-based biomarkers ( indicate cell type damage ) , ( 2 ) eye track ( detects mass effect/elevated intracranial pressure pathway disruption ) , ( 3 ) radiographic measure CT MRI ( detect structural abnormality ) , ( 4 ) standardize outcome assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Current algorithm assessment severity brain injury include Glasgow Coma Scale score measure . These measure adequate relate acute severity insufficiently sensitive subtle pathology result persistent deficit . The Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) measure also enable differentiation among types injury . Thus patient group single GCS level enter clinical trial may vastly heterogeneous severity type injury . Because outcome also vary accordingly , inappropriate classification undermines integrity clinical trial . Improved classification injury enable precise delineation disease severity type patient traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) clinical trial . Additionally , current brain injury trial rely outcome measure Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended , capture global phenomenon fail ass subtle difference outcome . Thus , many recent trial brain injury therapeutic fail . Sensitive outcome measure need determine well patient recover brain injury order test therapeutic prophylactic . Overview Methods : All trauma patient span full spectrum range non-brain injured , CT-negative , structurally brain injured , require surgery include study . A total 1000 patient 200 control recruit approximately 2 year . The study approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , enable waiver consent trauma patient become appropriate obtain consent . The trauma patient screen upon admission , potentially period waive consent , participation study ( target N screen = 16,000 per year ) . The screening process include : 1 . A standardized history physical examination do part standard care . 2 . A standardized assessment do research personnel . 3 . Eye track . 4 . Analysis serum biomarkers three time point within first 24 hour . 5 . MRI scan subset patient within one week injury . 6 . CT scan clinically indicate . 7 . Pathologic specimen clinically indicate . 8 . Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) analysis patient receive ventriculostomy catheter . 9 . Brain tissue oxygenation analysis patient receive Licox . The screening process take place , potentially period waive consent , allow patient stratify follow group associate targeted sample size two year : 1 . Isolated TBI ( N=400 ) 2 . Combined TBI Body Trauma ( N=400 ) 3 . Isolated Body Trauma ( N=200 ) 4 . Healthy , Uninjured Controls ( N=200 ) Upon discharge , patient recruit enroll long-term follow-up assessment . They see hospital follow time point post-injury : 2 week , 4 week , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year . At follow-up visit , participant ask undergo various assessment depend follow-up visit , include : 1 . Eye Tracking . 2 . Blood draw blood-based biomarker analysis . 3 . MRI scan one within one week post-injury . 4 . CT scan one admission . 5 . Cognitive , Neurologic , Quality Life Assessments Data Analysis : Patient outcome , measure sensitive outcome measure , link acute research finding order create classification scheme brain injury base objective measure accurately predict prognosis .</detailed_description>
