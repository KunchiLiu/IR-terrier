	<brief_summary>The overall objective : 1 . Assess mechanisms underlie HIIT-induced improvement insulin resistance whole-body , tissue , cellular level . 2 . Systematically compare different HIIT regimens help identify effective `` dos '' HIIT may optimal improve metabolic health obese adult . 3 . Assess ability/willingness obese subject adhere long-term HIIT program . Findings study greatly expand knowledge effect HIIT metabolic health , provide valuable information development program aim maximize key metabolic benefit exercise .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metabolic Adaptations Response High Intensity Interval Training Obese Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If subject eligible study , randomize one four different exercise training group . Before training ( twice 3 month train ) subject participate `` clinical study '' require stay overnight hospital . During clinical study , research team perform series metabolic test . Before 3 month training , research team ass subject `` free-living '' 24h blood sugar control use Continuous Glucose Monitor ( CGM ) . The research team measure several relevant clinical marker ( e.g. , whole body regional body fat assessment [ Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA ) Magnetic Resonance Imager ( MRI ) ] , hepatic lipid accumulation [ MRI analysis ] , blood lipid profile , rest metabolic rate , glycated hemoglobin [ hemoglobin A1c ] ) . After first 3 month training , adherence subject assign train program track next 9 month ( 1 year training total ) . One year initiate training program , subject ask return clinic quick follow-up visit research team complete standard clinical assessment ( e.g. , body weight , body composition , blood pressure , blood sample ) .</detailed_description>
