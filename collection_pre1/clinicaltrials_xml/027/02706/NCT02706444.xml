	<brief_summary>To evaluate role DCB angioplasty venous anastomotic stenosis hemodialysis graft , investigator would like perform randomize study compare result drug- coated balloon angioplasty conventional balloon angioplasty treatment venous anastomotic stenosis AVG term patency .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Drug-coated Balloon Versus Conventional Balloon Angioplasty Hemodialysis Graft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Procedure The Interventional angiographic suit follow standard hemodialysis relate interventional procedure PTA . Fistulogram perform prior PTA . All enrol patient undergo 3 6-month follow-up fistulogram information collect record treat study vessel picture angiographic image . These data record clinical recording form use excel program . 1 . Pretreatment evaluation 1.1 All procedure perform obtain write informed consent patient . No specific pre-treatment regimen need . 1.2 After sterile preparation draping , percutaneous access gain appropriately choose hemodialysis graft application local anesthesia . Diagnostic fistulogram perform identify evaluate target lesion possible secondary lesion . In case thrombotic occlusion AVG , diagnostic fistulogram do successful aspiration thrombectomy though sheath . 1.3 All lesion characterize location , length , degree stenosis . The degree stenosis evaluate two orthogonal plane , great degree stenosis use subsequent anatomic measurement . Anatomic measurement make use calibrated reference marker software within angiographic image system . The reference vessel define adjacent segment normal vein graft locate adjacent target lesion . The degree stenosis report maximum diameter reduction compare reference vessel diameter . 2 . PTA venous anastomosis AVG 2.1 Vascular sheath use case . 2.2 Balloon diameter chosen operator 's discretion , generally start balloon 10 % oversized compare adjacent normal vein graft group ( Reference Vessel Diameter : RVD ) . 2.3 Balloon length also choose discretion operator : In general , 4-cm- 6cm-long balloon use long lesion . 2.4 If patient request sedation , conscious sedation do . 2.5 After cross stenosis guide wire , conventional balloon catheter appropriately position across lesion fluoroscopic guidance . With use inflation device pressure gauge , balloon catheter gradually inflated stenosis eliminate . 2.6 Randomization assign successful conventional balloon angioplasty venous anastomotic stenosis AVG . After conventional angioplasty , patient randomly assign undergo DEB angioplasty receive conventional balloon angioplasty 3 minute ( upto norminal pressure ) . 2.7 If patient randomly assign DEB group , In.Pact® Drug-eluting balloon catheter ( 6 , 7mm diameter , ≦6cm length ) use addition conventional balloon angioplasty . A balloon diameter length equal use conventional balloon angioplasty group . 3 . Procedure Materials PRODUCT SIZE LENGTHS Drug Eluting balloon In.Pact® 6,7mm 4 , 6cm Conventional balloon Various conventional balloon catheter 6,7mm 4 , 6cm 4 . Follow-up - All patient follow PTA . When patient visit hemodialysis unit 3 6 month PTA , patient 's record update . - All patient visit hemodialysis unit bring angiographic suit undergo follow-up fistulogram evaluate re-stenosis . - Clinical follow-up perform hemodialysis unit , include check status hemodialysis use circuit general work-up .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age 19 2 . Hemodialysis patient AVG arm : Graft implant 30 day ago enrollment 3 . Vascular access actively use hemodialysis : At least one hemodialysis successful session enrollment . 4 . Clinical sign access dysfunction : decrease thrill , increased pulsatility , development collateral vein , limb swelling , difficulty cannulation , prolong bleeding hemodialysis , high venous pressure decrease hemodialysis flow rate hemodialysis . 5 . &gt; 50 % venous anastomotic stenosis AVG , confirm fistulogram ( angiography ) . 6 . ≦ 4cm venous anastomosis site lesion length 7 . Reference diameter &lt; 7mm nonstenotic vessel graft adjacent venous stenosis . 8 . Full expansion conventional balloon primary balloon angioplasty , confirm fluoroscopy . Exclusion criteria 1 .
