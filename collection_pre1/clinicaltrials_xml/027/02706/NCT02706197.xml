	<brief_summary>Tumors low oxygen level associate poor prognosis resistance standard radiotherapy chemotherapy . The ability make repeat oxygen measurement tumor could use help select effective treatment best time start therapy . The purpose study ascertain safety feasibility use implantable oxygen sensor , know OxyChip , make oxygen measurement tumor use EPR oximetry , technique relate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxygen Measurements Subcutaneous Tumors EPR Oximetry Using OxyChip</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I clinical trial . Total enrollment 12 patient . The study split phase IA ( short duration implantation &lt; 4 week cancer therapy plan prior excision ) phase IB ( long duration implantation receive radiation therapy neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior surgical excision ) , describe . The initial 6 patient OxyChip place short duration ( 4 week ) OxyChip remove tumor mass resect , prior delivery therapy . After successful implantation removal OxyChip first 6 protocol patient , enrollment open additional 6 patient either receive radiotherapy neoadjuvant chemotherapy OxyChip place . Up five oxygen measurement per week make course radiation chemotherapy . The OxyChips remove surgery . Patients receive radiation chemotherapy evaluate least weekly assessment respect adverse event primary objective oximetry measurement take periodically least one day implantation removal plan tumor excision ass secondary objective . Following resection , tissue surround OxyChip examine adverse event primary objective . For exploratory objective , tissue also examine biomarkers associate hypoxia growth .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Phase IA : Any tumor identify image physical examination go receive surgical resection intent remove entire tumor . The tumor must sufficiently large accommodate OxyChip . 2 . Phase IB : Any biopsyproven malignancy expect undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy prior resection . The tumor must sufficiently large accommodate OxyChip . 3 . Malignancy must present within 1.5 cm surface skin 4 . Subject must capable give informed consent acceptable surrogate capable give consent behalf subject . 5 . Anticipated time implantation plan surgical excision least three day . 1 . Pregnancy . 2 . Receipt concurrent chemotherapy radiotherapy , plan sequential chemotherapy radiotherapy , prior resection ( Phase 1B ) . 3 . Receipt Avastin , angiogenesis inhibitor study . 4 . Prior radiotherapy site implantation . 5 . Having implant ( removable ) device generate electrical artifact could alter EPR magnetic field , cardiac pacemaker defibrillator .</criteria>
