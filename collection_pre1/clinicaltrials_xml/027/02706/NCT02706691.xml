	<brief_summary>This phase IIa proof-of-concept open-label trial consist two cohort namely , HPV ( + ) HPV ( - ) run across multiple center University Chicago PCC Consortium . All eligible patient histologically-confirmed recurrent/metastatic HNSCC FGFR alteration receive BGJ398 125 mg PO daily . Patients FGFR1-3 high level amplification , mutation , translocation include .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Efficacy Single Agent BGJ398 FGFR1-3 Translocated , Mutated , Amplified Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives To assess efficacy BGJ398 FGFR alter HPV ( - ) HPV ( + ) HNSCC . Secondary Objectives 1 . To assess efficacy BGJ398 relation specific genetic aberration HPV ( + ) HPV ( - ) FGFR alter HNSCC ( i.e . FGFR3-TACC3 translocation , FGFR1 high copy number/amplification , FGFR2 mutation , FGFR3 mutation ) . 2 . To assess safety tolerability BGJ398 patient Head Neck Cancer . 3 . To assess progression free overall survival . Exploratory Objectives To determine mechanism resistance FGFR inhibition disease progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Must meet following : 1 . Histologically documented diagnosis squamous cell carcinoma head/neck include nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( lymphephithelioma histology ok criterion 2 met ) . ) Patients must progress prior platinum base therapy ( become intolerant ) prior enrollment study . 2 . FGFR genetic alteration ( specifically FGFR13 mutation , amplification , translocation ) via DNA RNA base assay . Prescreening complete prior enrollment study . Commercial local test typically expect , sample also send Univ . Chicago test . The following genetic aberration screen : FGFR1 amplification , FGFR1 somatic mutation , FGFR1 translocation . FGFR2 somatic mutation , FGFR2 translocation , FGFR2 amplification . FGFR3 somatic mutation , FGFR3 translocation , FGFR3 amplification . Other genetic FGF/FGFR pathway aberration may acceptable genetic change observe emerge require approval per Lead Investigator enrollment ( e.g . FGF amplification ) . 3 .

HPV status Oropharyngeal Carcinomas . While HPV status ( e.g . via p16 ) know prior consenting , HPV status ( e.g . use p16 IHC ) need establish prior start therapy . 11 . Presence measurable disease RECIST 1.1 12 . Availability tumor tissue ( e.g . FFPE ) genomic profile ( typically 12 unstained FFPE 510 micron slide , minimum 10 ) . 1 . History another primary malignancy except adequately treat situ carcinoma cervix nonmelanoma carcinoma skin curatively treat malignancy treat prior 3 month expect require treatment recurrence course study . 2 . Patients metastatic CNS tumor allow provide clinically stable period 30 day prior study entry requirement steroid ( close physiologic dos ) anticonvulsant therapy . Patients leptomeningeal involvement exclude . 3 . Patients receive prior selective FGFR inhibitor recurrent/metastatic disease setting . Prior use multikinase inhibitor include antiFGFR activity acceptable review Lead Investigator 4 . History and/or current evidence tissue calcification include , limited , soft tissue , kidney , intestine , myocardium lung exception calcify lymph node asymptomatic coronary calcification 5 . Current evidence corneal retinal disorder/keratopathy include , limited , bullous/band keratopathy , corneal abrasion , inflammation/ulceration , keratoconjuctivitis , confirm ophthalmologic examination 6 . Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption oral BGJ398 ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) 7 . History and/or current evidence endocrine alteration calcium/phosphate homeostasis , e.g. , parathyroid disorder , history parathyroidectomy , tumor lysis , tumoral calcinosis , etc unless lead investigator obtains approval Novartis . 8 . Treatment follow anticancer therapy prior first dose BGJ398 within state timeframes Cyclical chemotherapy ( intravenous ) within period 2 week unless ongoing side effect &gt; Grade 2 . Biological therapy ( include small molecule , and/or ) within period time ≤2 week prior start study drug unless ongoing side effect &gt; Grade 2 . Any investigational agent within period ≤ 2 week prior start study drug unless ongoing side effect &gt; Grade 2 . Wide field radiotherapy ( include radioisotope ) ≤ 2 week prior start study drug unless ongoing side effect &gt; Grade 2 . 9 . Patients currently receive treatment agent know strong inducer inhibitor CYP3A4 prohibit . 10 . Enzyme induce antiepileptic drug . 11 . Consumption grapefruit , grapefruit juice , pomegranate , star fruit , Seville oranges product within 7 day prior first dose . 12 .

Clinically significant cardiac disease include follow : Congestive heart failure require treatment ( NYHA grade ≥ 2 ) , LVEF &lt; 50 % determine MUGA scan ECHO , uncontrolled hypertension ( refer WHOISH guideline ) History presence clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia , atrial fibrillation , rest bradycardia , conduction abnormality Unstable angina pectoris acute myocardial infarction ≤ 3 month prior start study drug QTcF &gt; 450 msec ( gender ) History congenital long QT syndrome 20 . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test 21 . Known positive serology HIV , active Hepatitis B , and/or active Hepatitis C infection . 22 . Study medication administer Gtube , unless additional information manufacturer become available future . 23 . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , unless use highly effective method contraception dose 3 month follow discontinuation study treatment must use sex ( =female patient male partner ) . Highly effective contraception method include : Total abstinence ( line prefer usual lifestyle subject . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception Female sterilization ( surgical bilateral oophorectomy without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week take study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment Male sterilization ( least 6 month prior screen ) . For female subject study vasectomized male partner sole partner subject . Combination follow ( a+b a+c , b+c ) : 1 . Use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception form hormonal contraception comparable efficacy ( failure rate &lt; 1 % ) , example hormone vaginal ring transdermal hormone contraception 2 . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) 3 . Barrier method contraception : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository Note : Oral contraceptive ( OC ) , inject implanted hormonal method allow sole method contraception BGJ398 characterize respect potential interfere PK and/or effectiveness OCs . Postmenopausal woman allow participate study . Women consider postmenopausal child bear potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week ago . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider child bear potential . 24 .
