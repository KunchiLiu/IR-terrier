	<brief_summary>Endoscopic surgical procedure become common surgical specialty include gynecology one pioneer field specialty . Maintaining quality field view important patient safety also quality surgery reduce surgery time . The lens vision locate distal end optical vision endoscopic surgery direct contact anatomical structure . These lens find soil several phenomenon whose appearance mist constitute major obstacle clear field . The alteration vision require surgeon extraction optic order achieve cleaning lens . This clean carry many time necessary . Many strategy develop improve quality vision . These method relate development new optical vision also development lens clean material . In practice , clean carry use sterile swab sterile saline associate betadine iodine . Recently new material call `` FloShield Air System Vision System '' propose particularity combine anti-fog product temperature control system contact lens order fight condensation smoke . The purpose improve quality vision reduce fog phenomenon change temperature contact lens ( moisture reduction ) . Accordingly , assume reduction number stay reduction specific operative time associate cleaning . In context , wish evaluate effectiveness FloShield Air System vision system basis comparative , prospective , randomized reference method ( sterile water solution + Betadine ) endoscopic surgery gynecology .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective , Randomized Comparison Use FloShield Air System ® Versus Referenced Technic ( Water + Povidone-Iodine Solution ) During Gynecologic Endoscopic Surgery Evaluate Operative Lens Vision Quality</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The reduction vision endoscopic surgery common problem surgical specialty recur . Studies pathophysiological mechanism explain visual impairment fog emphasize role intraperitoneal temperature moisture contact optical lens . To add two cause impaired vision fluid projection passively encounter tissue exploration ( eg , blood , fat , ascites ) product reaction tissue surgery example , outcome smoke use coagulation material section . In situation vision may impair critical time optimal view need improve quality surgery . A report World Health Organization intend identify consequence impaired vision laparoscopic surgery . It emphasize impaired vision contribute surgical error use device incorrectly displacement instrument structure intend . Moreover , report increase operative time associate suboptimal view . Finally , psychological dimension disruption surgeon raise risk difficulty procedure . To minimize problem anti mist vision solution combine condensed water vapor spray system among others market recent year . The action mechanism system distribute steam droplet condense surface cold lens improve quality vision . Most , however , require clean optic , le theoretical frequency . Although use report literature use never evaluate basis robust methodology . Alternative method readily available povidone iodine act similarly significantly less expensive ( least 10 time ) mention material . No comparative study currently available support effectiveness material reference method inexpensive partially effective . Their use base solely experience expert opinion . Vision device `` FloShield Air System '' develop . We offer comparative evaluation effectiveness FloShield Air System vision system basis comparative , prospective , randomized reference method ( sterile water + Betadine ) gynecologic endoscopic surgery . We propose carry single-center , randomize , prospective trial compare efficacy term reduce number clean FloShield Air System vision system , prospective , randomized endoscopic surgery gynecology . After evaluation International Register Clinical Trials Registry ( http : //clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/about-site ) National Institutes Health American ongoing trial release interested interested effectiveness FloShield Air System vision device endoscopic surgery gynecology specifically primary endpoint . Currently , Recruiting trial concern system entitle `` Comparison FloShield Air System Versus clearify Visualization System ( D-HELP ) ) ( NCT02419911 ) . '' This non-academic comparative prospective trial efficiency . The originality protocol reside five point : - His academic nature : promoter University Hospital Tenon Hospital ( AP-HP ) - It attempt answer clinical question frequently clinical practice - The feasibility : experience surgical volume recruit center endoscopic management help support compute power . - Its safety patient - The methodological basis help support level I evidence new material</detailed_description>
