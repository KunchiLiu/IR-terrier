	<brief_summary>Exercise show improve quality life people multiple sclerosis exercise programme carry low moderate intensity . The next stage management condition establish people mild Multiple Sclerosis exercise , safely effectively high intensity . High intensity interval training ( HIIT ) involve repeated burst hard exercise intersperse period rest . High intensity interval trainingcould time efficient safe option people Multiple Sclerosis . Potential improvement areÍ¾ cardiovascular fitness , resistance fatigue , balance , quality life attitude physical exercise . Participants attend two session per week 6 week . Each session involve 6-10 set 60 second high intensity cycling follow 60 second rest . Potential participant must clinical diagnosis Mulitple Sclerosis 3 month , EDSS score less 2.5 , age 18-65 , one relapse last 2 year . From study investigator hope discover High Intensity Interval Training safe enjoyable form physical activity people mild Multiple Sclerosis . This hopefully lead large research trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Intensity Interval Training People With Mild Multiple Sclerosis : A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis autoimmune disease typically progressive involves damage nerve cell central nervous system . Living multiple sclerosis difficult experience physically psychologically . Some common symptom people MS include excessive fatigue , limb weakness , motor abnormality sexual dysfunction symptom dependant central nervous system pathology . Multiple Sclerosis common cause disability young middle age adult develop world . The relatively high incidence rate longitudinal nature condition large economic impact health care system , people Multiple Sclerosis family . Treatments able good manage condition still cure fundamental cause still unknown , symptom management maintenance function crucial . Exercise rehabilitation increasingly look allow patient well manage condition assist people multiple sclerosis self-manage care . For many year people multiple sclerosis limit activity level order exasperate symptom . Since research show supervised exercise ( aerobic strength ) training beneficial people mild moderate multiple sclerosis . Current evidence suggests exercise may actually go even improve function well managing symptom multiple sclerosis , may actually disease modify effect , suggest guidance long-term prescription imperative . High intensity interval training ( HIIT ) describe exercise characterise short burst vigorous effort follow period rest low intensity exercise . High intensity interval trainingis extremely variable mode exercise session alter intensity , duration number interval well duration activity choose rest period . High intensity interval train show effective alternative traditional endurance training often use exercise intervention . It also suggest High intensity interval trainingis enjoyable moderate intensity exercise . These finding important lack time lack enjoyment two commonly quote barrier regular activity . The project utilise pre-experimental one-group pre-test - post-test design . The participant assess baseline , follow intervention measure follow up.Patients purposively recruit multiple sclerosis clinic Royal Hallamshire Hospital Sheffield . Potential participant identify consultant neurologist research assistant clinic lists/patient record . Patients satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion given/sent recruitment letter participant information sheet informing study . The letter contain tear-off slip patient return research team indicate interest study participation . It clearly state letter obligation pressure participate patient interested future medical care jeopardise . Patients respond letter invitation invite Centre Sport Exercise Science consultation . Once participant recruit provide informed consent attend baseline assessment . Each participant undergo VO2peak test cycle ergometer . Gas measurement conduct breath breath mean telemetric spirometry , heart rate measure Polar system . The test conduct volitional exhaustion terminate follow criterion meet : - symptom exacerbation - symptom indicate risk safety health patient - plateau oxygen uptake increase workload and/ - respiratory exchange rate great 1.15 Three questionnaire administer participant determine effect exercise intervention physical activity level ( Godin Leisure Time Questionnaire ) , fatigue ( modify fatigue impact scale ) , health perception ( SF-36 ) . Participants also give ActiGraph accelerometer wear 7-days . The procedure repeat follow blind assessor . Participants attend two session per week 6 week intervention . Each session consist 6-10 set 60 second high intensity interval intersperse 60 second recovery . The workload interval set 80-90 % peak power achieve VO2peak test . This predict elicit 85-95 % heart rate reserve participant . After interval participant 's heart rate rate perceive exertion ( RPE ) collect . After session researcher complete Adverse Event form record event occur . Additionally participant complete physical activity enjoyment ( Perceived activity enjoyment scale ) one session per week . Outcomes assess two-time-points : baseline 6-week intervention . Personal characteristic ( e.g . postcode , marital status ethnicity , etc . ) condition specific data ( e.g . time since diagnosis , medication , onset symptom , use health care resource etc . ) collect .</detailed_description>
