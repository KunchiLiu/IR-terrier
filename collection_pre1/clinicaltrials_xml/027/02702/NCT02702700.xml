	<brief_summary>This clinical study aim explore intrapleural low-dose Visudyne®-mediated photodynamic therapy ( photo-induction ) pathway promote uptake systemically administer Lipoplatin™ pleural malignancy patient undergo video-assisted talcage malignant pleural effusion . Photo-induction expect overcome chemo-resistance pleural malignancy cisplatin-based chemotherapeutics thereby improve local tumor control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photo-induction Means Improve Cisplatin Delivery Pleural Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study assess safety tolerability intrapleural Visudyne®-mediated photo-induction mean selectively increase tumor uptake systemically administer Lipoplatin™ patient primary secondary pleural malignancy . The secondary objective : Assessment treatment efficacy measure dyspnea reduction , pleural effusion free survival well local relapse rate , progression free median overall survival . Analysis pleural intratumor penetration Lipoplatin™ repeat biopsy Lipoplatin concentration measurement Visudyne® treatment well vessel modulation relate parameter ( pericyte coverage , vessel morphology ) .</detailed_description>
