	<brief_summary>Dynamic contrast-enhanced ( DCE ) MRI give quantitative semi-quantitative information integrity vascular system use quantify blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) integrity . The BBB play pathophysiological role diabetes , cognitive disorder mild cognitive impairment , Alzheimer 's disease , multiple sclerosis , chronic traumatic encephalopathy . Although dysfunctional , change BBB integrity condition think subtle close intact value . Recent study show possible measure small change BBB integrity early sign disease use DCE MRI . The objective study apply optimize DCE image protocol novel image post-processing obtain new information BBB integrity trauma . These technique show promise improve clinical diagnosis , elucidate physiology various disease process .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measuring Blood Flow Characteristics Using Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives The objective investigator-initiated study continue extend research apply optimize DCE image protocol ( use standard FDA approve DCE sequence ) novel image post-processing obtain new information BBB integrity trauma . Study Procedure Overview : Patient 's LLUMC exist order MRI study head contrast ask would like participate study evaluate optimize DCE sequence provide information disease . Health control ask would like participate study order evaluate optimize DCE sequence provide useful information various CNS disease . Imaging : Following consent , subject image LLUMC use 3T MRI scanner ( Siemens Medical Solutions , Malvern , PA ) MRI safety screen questionnaire complete . Subjects ask lie positioned back MRI scanner . The coil place around head subject provide headphone and/or earplug scan . Imaging consist diagnostic MR protocol request order physician addition standard FDA approve DCE sequence . Data Collection Analysis The collected DCE data may process use standard FDA approve DCE software ( department already own us clinically ) , use clinical decision making purpose , add patient record . The data also process use specialize research software , processing use diagnostic clinical decision making purpose , add patient record . Ktrans value measure use region interest analysis process DCE data determine difference pathology interest healthy control .</detailed_description>
