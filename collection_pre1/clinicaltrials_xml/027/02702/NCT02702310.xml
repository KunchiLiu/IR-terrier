	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study low- dose total skin electron therapy treat patient stage IB-IIIA mycosis fungoides respond previous treatment ( refractory ) return period improvement ( relapse ) . Radiation therapy use high energy electron kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Rotisserie technique method patient receive total skin electron therapy stand rotate platform . Giving low dose total skin electron therapy use rotisserie technique may kill tumor cell , few side effect , may allow therapy repeat future clinically indicate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Dose Total Skin Electron Therapy Treating Patients With Refractory Relapsed Stage IB-IIIA Mycosis Fungoides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess skin-related quality life use establish method ( Skindex-29 ) , comparison make pre-treatment follow-up post-treatment skin assessment . II . To assess durability response use establish method ( modify Severity-Weight Assessment [ mSWAT ] tool ) , comparison make pre-treatment follow-up post-treatment skin assessment . III . To determine side effect profile low dose total skin electron therapy ( TSE ) mycosis fungoides administer via rotisserie technique . OUTLINE : The investigational portion research study involve collect quality life ( QOL ) questionnaire data objective measurement patient ' skin response , obtain radiation oncologist patient 's standard care radiation treatment planning . Patients also undergo standard care low-dose total skin electron therapy 1 hour daily day 10-21 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 12 week , every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
