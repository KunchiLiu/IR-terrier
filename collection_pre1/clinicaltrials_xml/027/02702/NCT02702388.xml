	<brief_summary>This multicenter , randomize , double-blind study conduct postmarketing requirement US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) evaluate whether low start dosage lenvatinib approve 24 mg daily ( QD ) provide comparable efficacy well safety profile participant RR-DTC radiographic evidence disease progression within prior 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Trial Lenvatinib ( E7080 ) Subjects With Iodine-131 Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Evaluate Whether Oral Starting Dose 20 mg 14 mg Daily Will Provide Comparable Efficacy 24 mg Starting Dose , But Have Better Safety Profile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist 2 phase , Prerandomization Phase Randomization Phase . The Prerandomization Phase last longer 28 day include Screening Period establish protocol eligibility Baseline Period confirm eligibility establish disease characteristic prior randomization treatment . The Randomization Phase consist Treatment Period Follow-up Period . It begin time randomization first participant consist 28-day blind study treatment cycle . The End Study occur end Randomization Phase , define last participant enrol completes Week 24 tumor assessment discontinue study treatment Week 24 . Participants randomly assign treatment 1 3 blind dosage lenvatinib 1:1:1 ratio receive lenvatinib 24 mg , 20 mg , 14 mg orally QD . Dose reduction occur succession base previous dose level ( 24 , 20 , 14 , 10 , 8 , 4 mg QD ) . Once dose reduce , may increase later date .</detailed_description>

Papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC ) Follicular variant Variants ( include limit tall cell , columnar cell , cribriformmorular , solid , oxyphil , Warthin'slike , trabecular , tumor nodular fasciitislike stroma , Hürthle cell variant papillary carcinoma , poorly differentiate ) 2 . Follicular thyroid cancer ( FTC ) Hurthle cell Clear cell Insular 2 . Measurable disease meeting follow criterion confirm central radiographic review : 1 . At least 1 lesion ≥1.0 cm long diameter nonlymph node ≥1.5 cm shortaxis diameter lymph node serially measurable accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST 1.1 ) use compute tomography/magnetic resonance imaging ( CT/MRI ) . If 1 target lesion nonlymph node , long diameter ≥1.5 cm . 2 . Lesions external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) locoregional therapy radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation must show evidence progressive disease base RECIST 1.1 deem target lesion . 3 . Participants must show evidence disease progression within 12 month ( additional month allow accommodate actual date performance screening scan , ie , within ≤13 month ) prior sign inform consent , accord RECIST 1.1 assess confirmed central radiographic review CT and/or MRI scan . 4 . Participants must Iodine131 refractory/resistant define least one following : 1 . One measurable lesion demonstrate iodine uptake radioiodine scan . 2 . One measurable lesion progress accord RECIST 1.1 within 12 month ( additional month allow accommodate actual date performance screening scan , ie , within ≤13 month ) Iodine131 therapy , despite demonstration radioiodine avidity time treatment pre posttreatment scan . These participant must eligible possible curative surgery . 3 . Cumulative activity Iodine131 &gt; 600 mCi 22 gigabecquerels ( GBq ) , last dose administer least 6 month prior study entry . 5 .
