	<brief_summary>Consumption sugar-sweetened beverage ( SSBs ) link rise rate overweight obesity . The prominent mechanism explain link SSBs obesity liquid calorie perceive body ; thereby , promote less satiety , less energy compensation weight gain energy consume solid form . This view support pooled analysis acute preload trial primarily measure food intake outcome . Though failure short-term compensation observe liquid calorie , result acute preload trial extrapolate infer liquid energy source lead weight gain long-term . To date , unclear whether liquid calorie differential effect solid calorie body weight gain long term . To increase clarity issue , investigator propose conduct systematic review meta-analysis long-term control feeding trial distinguish contribution liquid calorie solid calorie body weight long-term .

	<brief_title>Meta-analyses Liquid Versus Solid Calories Body Weight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The prevalence overweight obese individual dramatically rise past 30 year represent major threat public health . Sugars consume liquid form ( i.e . SSBs ) target prominent contributor towards obesity . Pooled analysis acute preload trial assess food intake primary outcome suggest liquid calorie sugar poorly compensate solid calorie . Though tempting , result acute study extrapolate infer liquid energy source lead weight gain long term . A study long-term randomize controlled trial Kaiser et al . find adult require consume sugar sweeten beverage ( SSBs ) additional source energy , dose-dependent weight gain observe . However , weight gain far less half amount one would predict gain use mathematical model . This suggest extend period time , majority energy consume SSBs indeed compensate . Need propose research : To date , unknown whether people compensate differently liquid versus solid source calorie long term . Objective : To synthesize evidence effect liquid calorie versus solid calorie body weight controlled trial . Design : This systematic review meta-analysis conduct accord Cochrane Handbook Systematic Reviews Interventions report accord Preferred Reporting Items Systematic Reviews Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) . Data source : MEDLINE , EMBASE , The Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials ( Clinical Trials ; CENTRAL ) search use appropriate search term supplement hand search reference include study . Study selection : The investigator include control trial ( randomize non-randomized ) compare effect liquid source calorie isocaloric exchange solid source calorie body weight &gt; = 7 day human ( healthy non-healthy ) . Data extraction : Following systematic exclusion base title abstract , 2 reviewer independently review extract relevant data report meet inclusion criterion . Risk bias assess use Cochrane Risk Bias Tool . All disagreement among reviewer resolve consensus . Missing variance data calculate use standard computation imputation . Outcomes : Body weight ( kg ) Data synthesis : Pooled analysis mean difference perform use generic inverse variance method . Random-effects model use even absence statistically significant between-study heterogeneity yield conservative summary effect estimate presence residual heterogeneity . Fixed-effects model use less 5 included trial . Crossover trial assess via paired analysis . Heterogeneity assess Cochran Q statistic quantify I2 statistic . Sensitivity subgroup analysis conduct identify source heterogeneity . Sensitivity analyse involve assessment heterogeneity upon systematic removal trial . If &gt; = 10 trial , study investigator conduct apriori subgroup analyse age , health status , comparator , dose , baseline measurement , randomization , study design ( parallel , crossover ) , energy balance ( positive , neutral , negative ) , follow-up ( &lt; = 4 week , &gt; 4 week ) risk bias . Meta-regression analysis assess significance categorical continuous subgroup analysis . When 10 trial available , publication bias investigate funnel plot formal test use Egger Begg test . If publication bias suspect , investigator attempt adjust funnel plot asymmetry impute miss study data use Duval Tweedie trim fill method . Evidence assessment : The strength evidence outcome assess use Grading Recommendations Assessment , Development Evaluation ( GRADE ) . Knowledge translation plan : The result disseminate interactive presentation local , national , international scientific meeting publication high impact factor journal . Target audience include public health scientific community interest nutrition obesity . Feedback incorporate use improve public health message key area future research define . Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers network among opinion leader increase awareness participate directly committee member development future guideline . Significance : The propose research aid distinguish role liquid calorie solid calorie body weight long-term . This strengthen evidence-base guideline improve health outcome educate healthcare provider patient , stimulate industry innovation , guide future research design .</detailed_description>
