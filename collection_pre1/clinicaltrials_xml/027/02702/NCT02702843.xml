	<brief_summary>The Study design compare effectiveness Near Infrared Fluorescence Cholangiography ( NIFC ) standard white light imaging ( WLI ) visualize identify main biliary hepatic structure ( Cystic Duct , Right Hepatic Duct , Common Hepatic Duct , Common Bile Duct , Cystic-CBD junction , Cystic-Gallbladder junction Accessory Ducts ) laparoscopic cholecystectomy . The aim demonstrate NIFC perform well standard white light ( WLI ) alone visualize identify extra-hepatobiliary structure ( Cystic Duct , Right Hepatic Duct , Common Hepatic Duct , Common Bile Duct , Cystic-CBD junction , Cystic-Gallbladder junction , Accessory Ducts ) dissection Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy ( LC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorescent Cholangiography v White Light Bile Ducts Identification</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , novel technique visualize structure use fluorescent light intravenous dye develop . Near Infrared Incisionless Fluorescent Cholangiography ( NIFC ) medical imaging technique use fluorescence detect properly label structure surgery . NIFC perform use image device purpose provide real-time simultaneous information color reflectance image ( white light ) fluorescence emission ( near infrared light ) . One light source use excite illuminate sample . Light collect use optical filter match emission spectrum fluorophore . Imaging lens digital camera use produce final image . During laparoscopic cholecystectomy , visualization extra-hepatic bile duct fluorescence call Near Infrared Incisionless Fluorescent Cholangiography ( NIFC ) . Fluorescence equipment dye necessary order perform NIFC , technique require radiation incision . A fluorescence dye administrate intravenously least 45 minute surgery , excrete liver bile duct The Study design compare effectiveness Near Infrared Fluorescence Cholangiography ( NIFC ) standard white light imaging ( WLI ) visualize identify main biliary hepatic structure ( Cystic Duct , Right Hepatic Duct , Common Hepatic Duct , Common Bile Duct , Cystic-CBD junction , Cystic-Gallbladder junction Accessory Ducts ) laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Eligible patient identify clinical test evaluation . Eligibility verify patient 's primary surgeon . The surgeon determine indication date surgery . Once patient confirm eligible , surgeon introduce study detail . If introduce study opportunity ask question , patient willing participate , he/she ask review sign inform consent document . Upon entry clinical trial patient randomly allocate intervention arm . Data collect enrolment time , surgery , end surgery one week surgery . Upon entry clinical trial , master study database ( REDCap , randomly allocate patient one study arm ( 1:1 ) within site ( 1:1 ) use computer generate random sequence . This provide allocation sequence site . Once patient enrolled database file REDCap initiate patient , he/she assign electronically one study arm . Patient blind intervention surgeon blind feasible due nature intervention . The study involve considerable number surgeon site , compensate potential bias favor either approach .</detailed_description>
