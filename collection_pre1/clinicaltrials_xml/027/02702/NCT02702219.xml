	<brief_summary>Mobility train form stretch flexibility training skeletal muscle common exercise . However , evidence scare study compare effect prolong static stretching ( &gt; 90 sec ) dynamic flexibility training method best length-enhancing effect time . Further , clinical practice concern low back pain , possibility thigh hamstring muscle affect movement control spine often mention , link fully explore control condition . The purpose study compare effect eight week dynamic flexibility train versus prolong static stretching mobility hamstring muscle adult reduce mobility muscle back thigh . The aim also compare sustained effect flexibility train two group , eight week completion intervention . Furthermore , aim explore different form flexibility training affect movement pattern lumbar spine adult person reduce mobility hamstring .</brief_summary>
