	<brief_title>Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure Reduction ( MB-BP ) Intervention Development</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mindfulness intervention customize prehypertensive/hypertensive patient never investigate . Until methodologically rigorous study evaluate customized intervention hypertension perform , know observe preliminary effect general mindfulness intervention blood pressure reduction could much effective tailor approach . Consequently , propose conduct behavioral intervention study evaluate whether Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) customize prehypertensive hypertensive patient potential provide clinically relevant reduction blood pressure . This customized intervention call Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure Reduction ( MB-BP ) . This study follow NIH Stage Model Behavioral Intervention Development , target likely proximally affect intervention identify , also effect longer-term outcome ( e.g . blood pressure , mortality ) . The select target , consistent theoretical framework early evidence mindfulness intervention could influence mental physical health outcome , measure self-regulation include ( 1 ) attention control ( specifically Sustained Attention Response Task ) , ( 2 ) emotion regulation ( specifically Difficulty Emotion Regulation Scale ) , ( 3 ) self-awareness ( specifically Multidimensional Assessment Interoceptive Awareness ) . Based degree target engagement , MB-BP customize good engage target need . The grant funding study perform concurrent systematic review impact mindfulness intervention self-regulation outcome . Based finding systematic review , self-regulation measure explore secondary outcome . Specific aim : 1 . To outline evaluate key active element MB-BP . This aim achieve use ( ) focus group participant undergo MB-BP intervention , ( b ) discussion expert ( include cardiologist , epidemiologist , mindfulness expert , mindfulness intervention instructor ) prior , follow pilot test MBHT participant , ( c ) clinical judgment investigator perform intervention . 2 . To evaluate impact MB-BP target engagement ( pre-post change effect size ) longevity target engagement ( follow-up time-points ) . Follow-up time period include 10 week , 6 month 1 year . This study prospective single-arm trial intervention development phase . Following phase , intervention develop , subsequent study ( different clinicaltrials.gov ID # ) utilize randomize control trial design evaluate causation effect size .</detailed_description>
