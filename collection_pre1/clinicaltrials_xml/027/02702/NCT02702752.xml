	<brief_summary>The aim present study measure dynamic change time plasma level SDF-1α patient confirm diagnosis AMI , AF CHF : 1 . Monitor plasma level SDF-1α diagnosis , long term treatment AMI , AF CHF . The SDF-1α level patient expect decrease treatment aforementioned condition . 2 . Correlate plasma level SDF-1α relation clinical , biochemical characteristic Acute Myocardial Infarction ( AMI ) , Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) Congestive Heart Failure ( CHF ) . In , investigator expect SDF-1α correlate severity heart disease . 3 . Study dynamic SDF-1α pertain property prognostic indicator long term follow risk readmission mortality patient diagnose AMI , AF CHF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study considers change SDF-1α level response treatment cardiac disease ( myocardial infarction , heart failure atrial fibrillation ) . SDF-1α level measure acute stage disease , stabilization long term detail . Levels SDF-1α correlate outcome disease . BLOOD SAMPLING AND MEASUREMENT OF SDF-1Α A blood sample 5 ml sample peripheral venepuncture anticoagulated heparin . Blood sample spin 15 minute 1000g within 30 minute collection . The result plasma store -80°C analysis . Levels SDF-1α plasma determine use commercially available ELISA kit accord manufacturer 's instruction . Analyses perform Clinical Research Centre , Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre . PATIENTS Patients include in-patient department Department Cardiology , Hvidovre University Hospital . Patients eligible inclusion diagnose myocardial infarction , atrial fibrillation heart failure , provide suffer malignant disease , diabetes mellitus type I II life expectancy least one year . Exclusion criterion base upon fact serum SDF-1α level elevate malignant disease SDF-1α contributes neoangiogenesis tumour mass , SDF-1α level recently demonstrate elevated diabetes . The investigator include 20 patient cardiac condition mention well control group 20 subject without cardiac disease ( include hypertension ) , diabetes , hypercholesterolemia , malignant disease . PATIENTS WITH MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION Patients present non-ST elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) include . The diagnostic criterion symptom cardiac ischaemia ( angina angina-equivalent symptom ) elevate troponin T ( 14 ng/mL ) and/ ECG change ischemia ( horizontal downsloping ST depression ≥ 0.5 mm J-point ≥ 2 contiguous lead ) . Patients exclude diagnose `` type 2 myocardial infarction '' , i.e . myocardial ischaemia due mismatch myocardial oxygen demand supply due condition severe anaemia , arrhythmia hypotension . Patients also exclude referred coronary angiography , atrial fibrillation cardiac failure LVEF ≤ 40 % . The SDF-1α level patient measure first day hospitalization , coronary angiography , discharge ( approximately day 3-5 ) , three month inclusion . PATIENTS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Patients present ECG-documented atrial fibrillation include unstable , i.e . heart rate exceed 100 in-patient treatment indicate . Patients exclude suffer unstable ischaemic heart disease ( unstable angina myocardial infarction ) , heart failure LVEF ≤ 40 % arrhythmia secondary another condition infection . SDF-1α level measure first day hospitalization , time discharge ( medical electrical cardioversion stabilization heart rate ) three month inclusion . PATIENTS WITH CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE Patients include present decompensated heart failure . They must symptoms heart failure ( dyspnoea and/ oedema ) severe enough warrant in-patient treatment . The diagnosis must confirm echocardiography show LVEF ≤ 40 % . Patients exclude suffer unstable ischaemic heart disease ( unstable angina myocardial infarction ) atrial fibrillation . The SDF-1α level measure first day hospitalization , medical stabilization time discharge , three month inclusion . PATIENT INCLUSION AND DATA COLLECTION Patient inclusion take place three consecutive month . Patients include within first day hospital admittance . Each day , member project group screen patient admit within last day personally contact eligible inclusion . Patients inform verbally give write participant information . Patients give time consideration accept participation , ask sign consent form . Due project design , accord first blood sample take within first day hospitalization , patient ask consent project participation day initial contact research group member . Conversations hold private setting department , patient invite bring relation , prefer . As regard control group , include patient initially refer outpatient evaluation Department Cardiology , cardiac disease find . Members project group screen patient Outpatients Department personally contact eligible inclusion control group . The control group select age-matched patient . Information project provide patient . Based upon information patient ' medical file , register whether patient suffer hypertension , peripheral vascular disease , stroke , transient cerebral ischaemia , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease renal insufficiency . Medication time admittance hospital medication give hospitalization register . Clinical status ( dyspnoea , palpitation , oedema , blood pressure heart rate ) time inclusion time discharge hospital note . This information seek patient file Kiso system use record vital parameter patient . The recorded information ( pre-existing condition , medication clinical status two time-points ) available project group . This information use background demographic , evaluation level SDF-1α correlate clinical status , allow correction factor , medication , level SDF-1α . FOLLOW-UP All patient expect see Outpatients ' Department 2-3 month discharge hospital . This appointment part standard treatment control plan patient AF , CHF NSTEMI , respectively arranged part project . Certain information register patient file time follow-up : Clinical status ( NYHA class , oedema , pulmonary congestion , angina ) , heart rhythm , medication , intercurrent hospital admission . One year inclusion , patient file review follow information register : Whether patient alive cardiovascular rehospitalisation . In case hospitalization , date admission , duration diagnosis register . Statistical consideration data analysis Baseline data SDF-1α level patient demographic ( include comorbidities use medication ) evaluate use descriptive statistic . Normally distribute data present mean standard deviation , whereas skew data present median range . If necessary , skew data transform . The influence patient characteristic ( age , sex comorbidities ) SDF-1α level evaluate use multiple regression analysis SDF-1α level dependent variable patient characteristic explanatory variable . SDF-1α level compare patient group use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) . Within group patient , change SDF-1α level time ( three time point ) analyse use ANOVA . The investigator previously measure SDF-1α level patient various type AF ( permanent versus paroxysmal ) . Based upon result ( SDF-1α level standard deviation different group ) , investigator estimate proposed sample size 20 patient disease group confer study sufficient statistical power . The statistical analysis perform collaboration statistician Steen Ladelund ( Clinical Research Centre , Hvidovre University Hospital ) . THE RESEARCH GROUP The study conduct close collaboration Department Cardiology Clinical Research Centre Hvidovre University Hospital . The research group consist follow person : Dr L. Vimal Hurry , MD , project responsible . He junior doctor Department Cardiology research work beside clinical employment . Dr Ulrik Dixen , MD , PhD , consultant Department Cardiology . Dr Ulrik Dixen conduct AF research several year experience plan conduct clinical study , well supervise junior researcher . Dr Nadia Landex , MD , PhD , train cardiology , currently Roskilde University Hospital . She PhD histochemistry use experience basic research initiate research biomarkers AF Hvidovre University Hospital , include research topic , project plan initial laboratory work . Medical student Maha Alsawaf write bachelor thesis cardiology research group basic research experience . Maha Alsawaf assist inclusion patient . Medical student Ema Rastoder experience clinical research skilled patient communication . Ema Rastoder assist inclusion patient . Project member Clincial Research Centre : Head Department Ove Andersen , MD , PhD , extensive experience biomarker research stage project development implementation research result . Anne Langkilde , MSc , PhD , likewise experienced biomarker research , particularly prognostic importance biomarkers disease . Anne Langkilde close collaborator initial project regard measurement biomarkers AF . Together , research team experience biomarker research well access research laboratory highly skilled laboratory technician .</detailed_description>
