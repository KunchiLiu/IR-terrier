	<brief_summary>This pilot research trial study magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) cardio ( heart ) -pulmonary ( lung ) exercise test evaluate exercise intolerance patient stage I-III breast cancer treatment chemotherapy drug call anthracyclines . Anthracyclines related heart problem , cardiac abnormality , bone muscle dysfunction . Patients breast cancer expose anthracycline drug may also experience progressive fatigue exercise intolerance may limit daily activity important barrier patient return work . Using MRI cardio-pulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) may help doctor understand cause fatigue exercise intolerance patient receive anthracycline chemotherapy may also allow doctor plan good treatment protect patient ' heart , cardiovascular system , bone muscle function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility perform upright treadmill cardio-pulmonary exercise stress test utilizing magnetic resonance imaging . II . To determine reproducibility measure peak oxygen uptake ( V02 ) cardiac output well arterio-venous oxygen difference ( A-V02 ) difference survivor breast cancer treatment control participant . OUTLINE : Patients undergo CPET use one-way breathing mask 2 separate day 1-2 week apart . Patients also undergo MRI within 60 second exercise .</detailed_description>
