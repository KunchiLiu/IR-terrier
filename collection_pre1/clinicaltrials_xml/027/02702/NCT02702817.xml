	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Low-dose Naproxen Cognitively Intact Persons Risk Alzheimer 's Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial enrol 200 cognitively normal person age 60+ either parental history AD history two affect first-degree relative . Persons age 55-59 may admit current age &lt; = 15 year young AD onset index relative . Such person approximately 3-fold increase risk AD dementia . We expect majority show evidence progressive pre-clinical AD . Participants randomize 1:1 receive common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) naproxen over-the-counter dosage ( naproxen sodium 220 mg ) identical-appearing placebo tablet twice daily . At baseline three follow-up visit ( 3 month , 12 month 24 month randomization ) test cognitive ability undergo brain imaging structural functional MRI . They also test sensori-neural capacity olfactory identification ability discern speak language distract environment ( test central auditory processing ) . About 2/3 participant also volunteer undergo series lumbar puncture donation cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , assay several biochemical marker AD understood present decade longer onset symptom . As well , plasma CSF assay presence naproxen numerous marker inflammatory process ( cytokine chemokines ) . The central hypothesis administration naproxen suppress inflammatory marker also slow reverse progress change cognition biomarkers pre-clinical stage AD . Upon completion two year treatment , participant follow two year observe whether treatment-related change sustain -- indicate treatment effect represent modification disease process , oppose temporary change brain function .</detailed_description>
