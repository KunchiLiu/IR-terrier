	<brief_summary>This study use special type scan call positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan take picture brain . During PET scan , special dye call 11C-PBR28 injected body . 11C-PBR28 stick part brain inflammation . The purpose study see 11C-PBR28 detect inflammation patient Parkinson 's disease dementia dementia Lewy body . 11C-PBR28 consider drug Food Drug Administration . 11C-PBR28 treatment disease . Rather , 11C-PBR28 used measure inflammation brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study do see 11C-PBR28 could useful diffuse Lewy body disease . Diffuse Lewy Body Disease refer subject either Parkinson 's disease dementia dementia Lewy body . The hypothesis 11C-PBR28 binding great patient diffuse Lewy body disease control , large difference temporal limbic region brain . Participants medical history examination . This include question think memory . Participants blood drawn routine lab test . Blood also test special genetic test make sure 11C-PBR28 scan work . A special genetic blood test also do see participant gene associate dementia Lewy body cause dementia . Participants receive result special genetic test . Participants also magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan brain . If participant still meet inclusion exclusion criterion procedures do , participant one PET scan use 11C-PBR28 . This scan take place Columbia University Medical Center Kreitchman PET Center . On day PET scan intravenous ( IV ) catheter ( tube ) place participant 's arm . The participant also arterial catheter place artery wrist . Participant ask lay PET scanner . A CT scan take participant 's head . A small amount 11C-PBR28 injected IV . A member study team draw blood arterial catheter . The PET scan last 90 minute . The participant ask lay still scan . The amount radiation 11C-PBR28 PET scan 20 millicurie . Similar amount 11C-PBR28 give 100 human subject prior study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion patient : 1 . Age 60 old . 2 . Meet criterion either ) dementia Lewy body , b ) Parkinson 's disease dementia . 3 . Written oral fluency English . 4 . Able participate schedule evaluation complete require test procedure . 5 . In opinion investigator , subject must consider likely comply study protocol high probability complete study . Inclusion criterion control : 1 . Age 60 old . 2 . Normal cognitive motor function base neurological examination . 3 . Written oral fluency English . 4 . Able participate schedule evaluation complete require test procedure . 5 . In opinion investigator , subject must consider likely comply study protocol high probability complete study . 1 . Past present history certain brain disorder . 2 . Certain significant medical condition . Examples uncontrolled epilepsy multiple serious injury . 3 . Contraindication MRI scanning . 4 . Conditions preclude entry scanner ( e.g . morbid obesity , claustrophobia , etc. ) . 5 . Exposure research relate radiation past year , combine study , would place subject allowable limit . 6 . Low affinity bind TSPO genetic screen 7 . Currently take anticoagulant drug ( e.g. , warfarin ) . 8 . Women childbearing potential .</criteria>
