A systematic review meta-analysis prospective cohort study consider `` Gold Standard '' evidence . To provide evidence-based guidance support development public health policy relation sugar primary prevention diabetes , conduct series systematic review meta-analyses relation food source fructose-containing sugar incident type 2 diabetes related cardiometabolic disease prospective cohort study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Sugars emerge one important public health target . Attention focus special role fructose base unique biochemical , metabolic , endocrine response . These mechanism , however , fail translate clinically meaningful effect calorie-matched comparison source carbohydrate . Sugars-sweetened beverage ( SSBs ) appear special case . Whereas large prospective cohort study show consistent relation SSBs incident obesity , diabetes , metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) , hypertension , coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , stroke , gout , association show model total sugar ( exception gout ) food source added/free sugar pure fruit juice , yogurt , even sweet . In absence clear signal sugar alone , unclear whether association see SSBs hold important food source sugar . Need review : As dietary guideline public health policy shift toward food dietary-pattern base recommendation , lack high quality synthesis translation role different food source sugar cardiometabolic disease represent urgent call strong evidence support guideline development . Objectives : To build previous work , conduct series systematic review meta-analyses compare important food source added/free sugar ( SSBs , pure fruit juice , yogurt , sweet , cereal , etc ) . relation incident cardiometabolic disease . Design : Our propose series systematic review meta-analyses follow successful protocol use previous CIHR-funded knowledge synthesis fructose cardiometabolic risk ( clinicaltrials.gov , NCT01363791 ) . The knowledge syntheses conduct accord Cochrane Handbook Systematic Reviews Interventions report accord Preferred Reporting Items Systematic Reviews Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) . Data source : MEDLINE , EMBASE , The Cochrane library search . Study selection : We include cohort assess relation different food source fructose-containing sugar ( SSBs , pure fruit juice , yogurt , sweet , cereal , etc ) incident type 2 diabetes , MetS , hypertension , CHD , stroke , gout . Data extraction : Two investigator independently extract relevant data ass risk bias . Outcomes : We assess 6 outcome : type 2 diabetes , MetS , hypertension , CHD , stroke , gout . Data synthesis : Risk ratio pool use generic inverse variance method food source fructose-containing sugar . Random-effects model use even absence statistically significant between-study heterogeneity , yield conservative summary effect estimate presence residual heterogeneity . Fixed-effects model use &lt; 5 included study . Paired analyse apply crossover trial . Heterogeneity assess Cochran Q statistic quantify I2 statistic . To explore source heterogeneity , investigator conduct sensitivity analysis , study systematically remove . If &gt; =10 study , investigator also explore source heterogeneity priori subgroup analysis ( follow-up , adjustment , exposure assessment , dose , outcome ascertainment , risk bias ) . Meta-regression analysis assess significance categorical continuous subgroup analysis . When &gt; =10 study available , publication bias investigate inspection funnel plot formal test use Egger Begg test . If publication bias suspect , investigator attempt adjust funnel plot asymmetry impute miss study data use Duval Tweedie trim fill method . Evidence Assessment : The strength evidence outcome assess use Grading Recommendations Assessment , Development Evaluation ( GRADE ) . Knowledge translation plan : We follow Ottawa model . Results disseminate presentation scientific meeting publication high impact journal . Webcasts social medium post YouTube video , Facebook , twitter LinkedIn also use . Target adopter include clinician , ally health professional , policy maker , industry , researcher , patient group . Significance : The propose project aid knowledge translation relate health effect food source sugar , inform evidence-based guideline improve health outcome educate healthcare provider patient , stimulate industry innovation , guide future research design .</detailed_description>
