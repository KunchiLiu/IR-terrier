	<criteria>1 . The subject legal age participate study per law respective geography . 2 . The subject document paroxysmal , persistent , permanent longterm/longstanding persistent nonvalvular atrial fibrillation ( i.e. , subject diagnose rheumatic mitral valvular heart disease ) . 3 . The subject eligible define protocol pharmacologic regimen warfarin antiplatelet therapy follow WATCHMAN FLX Device implant . 4 . The subject eligible come warfarin therapy LAA seal ( i.e. , subject condition would require longterm warfarin therapy suggest current standard medical practice ) . 5 . The subject calculate CHADS2 score 2 great CHA2DS2VASc score 3 great . 6 . The subject able understand willing provide write informed consent participate trial . 7 . The subject able willing return require followup visit examination . 1 . Subjects currently enrol another investigational study registry would directly interfere current study , except subject participate mandatory governmental registry , purely observational registry associate treatment . Each instance must bring attention sponsor determine eligibility , regardless type coenrollment propose . 2 . The subject require longterm anticoagulation therapy reason AFrelated stroke risk reduction , example due underlie hypercoaguable state ( i.e. , even device implant , subject would eligible discontinue warfarin due medical condition require chronic warfarin therapy ) . 3 . The subject contraindicate warfarin therapy . 4 . The subject contraindicate allergic aspirin . 5 . Subject contraindicate clopidogrel ( P2Y12 inhibitor Japan ) . 6 . The subject indicate clopidogrel ( P2Y12 inhibitor Japan ) therapy take clopidogrel ( P2Y12 inhibitor Japan ) within 7 day prior WATCHMAN FLX Device implant . 7 . The subject planning cardiac noncardiac invasive surgical procedure within 30 day prior 60 day WATCHMAN FLX Device implant ( include , limited : cardioversion , coronary angiogram without percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , cardiac ablation , cataract surgery , endoscopy , etc. ) . 8 . The subject prior stroke ( cause , whether ischemic hemorrhagic ) transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within 90 day prior enrollment . 9 . The subject myocardial infarction ( MI ) document clinical record either nonST elevation MI ( NSTEMI ) STelevation MI ( STEMI ) , without intervention , within 90 day prior enrollment . 10 . The subject history atrial septal repair ASD/PFO device . 11 . The subject implant mechanical valve prosthesis position . 12 . The subject currently document history , New York Heart Association Class IV Congestive Heart Failure . 13 . The subject childbearing potential , plan become pregnant time study ( method assessment upon study physician 's discretion ) .</criteria>
