	<brief_summary>This study evaluate inhale molgramostim ( recombinant human ( rh ) Granulocyte Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) ) treatment autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis patient . A third patient receive inhaled molgramostim daily 24 week , third receive inhale molgramostim every day 24 week third receive inhaled matching placebo 24 week</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The trial randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled multicentre clinical trial investigate efficacy safety inhale molgramostim ( rhGM-CSF ) autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis ( aPAP ) patient . The primary objective efficacy Alveolar-arterial oxygen difference 24-weeks treatment . Secondary objective requirement , time , Whole Lung Lavage ( WLL ) , effect pulmonary function , tolerance exercise , effect dyspnea , cough Quality Life , effect compute tomography ( CT ) score . Number report adverse event ( AEs ) , serious AEs , adverse drug reaction monitor . The trial include two phase ; Double-blind treatment period consist eight trial visit ( Screening , Baseline , Weeks 4,8,12 , 16 , 20 24 randomisation ) Follow-up period consist five trial visit ( Weeks 4 , 12 , 24 , 36 48 post-treatment ) . In Double-blind treatment period , eligible subject randomise treatment 24 week either : 1 ) inhale molgramostim ( 300 µg ) daily , 2 ) inhale molgramostim ( 300 µg ) match placebo administer intermittently ( seven day seven day ) 3 ) inhale placebo daily . During Double-blind treatment period , WLL may apply rescue therapy case significant clinical worsening . Brief risk assessment : There currently approve pharmacological treatment patient PAP , therefore unmet need treatment modality exist . Results pre-clinical study inhale molgramostim nebuliser solution show expected pharmacological effect white blood cell ( WBC ) population locally systemically line observed effect IV administration molgramostim . No severe , serious dose-limiting AEs observe first clinical study human ( MOL-001 ) . The common AE cough , report similar incidence molgramostim nebuliser solution placebo . Increases WBC population blood consistent know mechanism action observe ; consider clinically significant . Only two case ( total WBC increase eosinophilia ) report AEs . No development anti-drug antibody observe .</detailed_description>
