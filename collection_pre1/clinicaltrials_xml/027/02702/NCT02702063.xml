	<brief_title>Calibrating Cardiac Output Measurement Electrical Cardiometry With Transthoracic Echocardiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac output ( CO ) key variable describe treat cardiovascular system . The ideal cardiac output ( CO ) monitor would safe , non-invasive , low-cost , painless , easy interpret would allow continuous , hands-free acquisition accurate data . Electrical cardiometry ( EC ) , recent version impedance cardiography ( ICG ) , meet many criterion ideal monitor previously publish research suggest EC successfully trend CO1-3 , accuracy measure absolute value stroke volume ( SV ) inconsistent publish research4-8 . Electrical cardiometry work send insensible high frequency alternate current thorax measure change thoracic impedance attribute systolic blood flow acceleration cardiac cycle . Using fiducial point trace first derivative impedance , EC calculate leave ventricular ejection time ( LVET ) mean velocity blood systole . By estimate patient constant primarily base body mass ( 'volume electrically participate tissue ' ( VEPT ) ) , stroke volume estimate following way : - SVEC = VEPT * Mean blood velocity * correct Flow Time ( FTc ) . Cardiac output monitor typically validate reference standard , traditionally thermodilution use pulmonary artery catheter ( PAC ) . Given risk associate use pulmonary artery catheters9 alternative method , transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) , lend valuable substitute technique measure CO. Transthoracic echocardiography safe , painless non-invasive . Similarly EC , SV estimate TTE base measurement mean blood velocity ejection time ( mean blood velocity x ejection time = velocity time integral , VTI ; ( Figure 3 ) ) . However , contrast EC , parameter blood velocity leave ventricular ejection time multiply normative patient constant , measure parameter : leave ventricular outflow tract area ( LVOT area ) : - SVTTE = LVOT area * mean blood velocity * ejection time . Main disadvantage use TTE CO-measurement advance training need obtain VTI measurement highly labor intense obtain repeated VTIs continuous repeat CO measurement . Measurement LVOT area , contrast , one-time measurement obtain parasternal long axis view , necessitate basic training TTE . Recently Martin colleagues10 compare SV parameter derive EC TTE sample 44 healthy pregnant volunteer find excellent agreement mean leave ventricular ejection time heart rate . However , agreement SV poor percentage error 42 % Bland-Altman analysis . Hypothesizing methodology estimate SV , EC TTE , use measure blood velocity systolic ejection time , Martin et al . hypothesize agreement method could significantly improve calibrate SV-EC LVOT area derive one time TTE measurement . Based multiplicative linear regression model follow log-linear transformation Martin et al . derive follow formula calibration : SVEC_Modified = 2.2 * LVOT_area ( 0.705 ) * SV_EC ( 0.388 ) * Weight ( 0.21 ) By apply formula , agreement SV measurement significantly improve percentage error decrease 22 % . However , data derive specific patient population ( pregnant woman ) accuracy modify SV-assessment validate prospective manner . Therefore , study proposes compare SV-estimates derive EC TTE non-pregnant outpatient undergo routine echocardiography assessment . Primary aim study evaluate agreement method improve calibrate SV-measurements obtain electrocardiometry one-time LVOT area measurement obtain TTE . Secondary aim perform passive leg raise test compare sensitivity identify fluid responsiveness monitoring methodology . Third aim compare CO derive measurement EC TTE gold standard measurement derive patient undergo routine right heart catheterisation evaluation cardiac pulmonary function .</detailed_description>
