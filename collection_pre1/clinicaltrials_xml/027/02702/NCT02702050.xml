	<brief_title>Effect Mechanical Stimulation Mastectomy Scars</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Breast cancer common among woman . After surgical intervention like mastectomy , woman breast cancer may suffer physical , emotional psychosocial complication . Evidence suggest comprehensive physiotherapy program , include patient education , manual technique , therapeutic exercise compression bandaging , effective managing complication . Scarring frequently overlook past study . Besides cosmetic issue , post mastectomy scar may cause adverse physical , functional , psychological outcome . The effect mechanical stimulation mastectomy scar well investigate yet . Objectives : To investigate efficacy mechanical stimulation : ( ) alleviate scar appearance - pigmentation , vascularity , pliability thickness , ( ii ) reduce shoulder morbidity , ( iii ) improve arm function , ( iv ) enhance quality life , woman breast cancer mastectomy . Setting : Out-patient physiotherapy breast care clinic Hong Kong Queen Elizabeth Hospital Participants : One hundred eight woman breast cancer mastectomy recent 6 week recruit . Methodology : An assessor-blind , randomize control trial conduct . 108 woman breast cancer mastectomy recruit breast care clinic Queen Elizabeth Hospital . They randomly allocate block randomization method either mechanical stimulation group ( n= 54 ) conventional treatment group ( n=54 ) . Both study group receive educational session commencement program . Twelve session 40-minute remedial exercise , 5-minute warm 5-minute cool exercise provide within 6-week period ( i.e. , two session per week ) subject . For mechanical stimulation group , ten-minute mechanical stimulation program provide . For conventional treatment group , mechanical stimulation give . Primary outcome include scar evaluation Vancouver Scar Scale spectrophotometry . Secondary outcome composite measurement shoulder morbidity , include numeric pain rating scale ( NPS ) , shoulder range movement hand grip strength ; arm function evaluate Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand ( DASH-HKPWH ) questionnaire ; quality life measure Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy - Breast Cancer ( FACT-B ) . Outcome assessment baseline , immediately 6-week program , 3-month follow-up period conduct blind assessor breast care clinic . Data Analysis : The result analyze use two-way repeat measure analysis variance Statistical Package Social Sciences version 21.0 . Alpha level set 0.05 . Potential Clinical Significance Study : Improvement physiotherapy scar management might potentially improve scar appearance - pigmentation , vascularity , pliability thickness , decrease shoulder morbidity , improve upper limb function , enhance quality life woman breast cancer mastectomy . If mechanical stimulation protocol proven effective , bring significant advance physiotherapy practice post-mastectomy care evidence-based manner .</detailed_description>
