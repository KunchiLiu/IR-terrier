	<brief_summary>14,000 new case rectal cancer diagnose year , frail elderly patient represent rise proportion patient . Whilst gold standard often remove tumour restore bowel continuity , surgeon often avoid procedure group patient unfortunately tolerate surgical complication poorly . Such surgical complication may present life threaten sepsis , prolong hospital stay , delay cancer therapy elderly frail patient often lead loss independence quality life . In set , two alternative procedure ( Hartmann 's procedure OR intersphincteric APE ) may use employ roughly equal measure UK ( nationwide survey , Dec 2013 , unpublished data ) . It anecdotally felt Hartmann 's procedure ( HP ) great risk surgical complication ( 30 % ) small retrospective study show ( 1-3 ) , however prospective data support view . Whilst surgeon choose intersphincteric APE ( IAPE ) basis lower surgical complication rate , many due perceive limitation technique ( longer operating time , risk tumour perforation ) , unproven . We feel large , prospective dataset require demonstrate superiority IAPE HP convince remain surgeon change procedure . We explore possibility full randomise trial answer question , however feasible due difficulty randomisation patient . Very little data available regarding use IAPE set rectal cancer , however many surgeon employ technique , specifically adapt technique set reduce chance tumour perforation ( two stage , staple rectum remove anal canal separately ) . It possible surgeon prefer HP consider , combine lack prospective data reluctant change technique . We confident demonstrate significant difference surgical complication rate promote modification IAPE surgical technique significantly reduce surgical harm frail patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hartmann 's Versus Intersphincetric APE : A Prospective , Multicentre Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Having establish network unit ( UK Europe ) also keen answer question power prospective observational cohort study demonstrate significant reduction surgical complication rate ( 30 % 15 % ) . In conjunction go Swedish randomise trial hope data study provide compel evidence UK surgeon change practice . If study reveals modest difference complication , use data gather design reapply full funding RCT additional advantage able clearly demonstrate network unit capable recruit necessary number patient . The overarch aim study therefore : 1 . Determine difference surgical complication rate HP IAPE 2 . Assess effect IAPE technique intra operative tumour perforation rate The objective study : 1 . Determine surgical complication rate procedure ( graded Clavien-Dindo ) 2 . Assess impact secondary outcome ( length stay , readmission , reintervention , medical complication , time chemotherapy , quality life ) 3 . Determine complication rate IAPE dependant surgical technique 4 . Determine patient clinician acceptability randomisation require Data Collection Data collect specific CRF baseline 30 post operative day , data completely anonymised data collect past 30 day . The easy use well validate Clavien-Dindo scale use grade surgical complication , also calculate Comprehensive Complication Index integrate medical surgical complication felt represent accurate estimation post operative complication ( 4 ) . Data collect following time point : BASELINE INTRAOPERATIVE POST OPERATIVE ( 30 day ) Age Surgical approach ( lap , open ) Pathological stage Sex Anaesthetic type TME quality BMI Operative time Length stay Comorbidities Intra operative perforation Readmission ASA score Length anorectal stump ( HP ) Surgical complication ( Clavien-Dindo scale ) Radiological stage Antibiotics Medical complication Distance tumour anal verge Method IAPE ( one v two stage ) Comprehensive Classification Index score Preoperative therapy 30 day quality life Quality life Patient willingness randomise Reason avoid primary anastomosis Surgeon willingness randomise Surgeon 's reason op choice Data Analysis As observation analysis , report unadjusted difference HP IAPE may result biased comparison . The primary analysis therefore multivariable analysis adjust confound factor . To ensure analysis keep sample size calculation , evaluation primary outcome base 90 % confidence interval .</detailed_description>
