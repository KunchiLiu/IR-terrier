	<brief_summary>Currently standard treatment muscle invasive bladder cancer complete removal bladder adjacent organ , prostate ovary . Radical cystectomy fraught complication risk death . The researcher hope learn chemoradiation ( i.e . use chemotherapy radiation ) , also acceptable treatment muscle invasive bladder cancer , use good alternative therapy option .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Pathologically ( histologically ) proven diagnosis primary carcinoma bladder ( transitional cell cancer ) within 8 week registration . Operable patient whose tumor primary carcinomas bladder exhibit histologic evidence muscularis propria invasion AJCC clinical stage T2T4a , Nx N0 , M0 If radiologic evaluation lymph node interpret `` positive '' , must evaluate either lymphadenectomy percutaneous needle biopsy . Patients histologically cytologically confirm node metastasis metastasis eligible . Patients must adequately function bladder thorough evaluation urologist undergone thorough transurethral resection bladder tumor judge safely possible . Patients must consider able tolerate systemic chemotherapy combine pelvic radiation therapy , radical cystectomy joint agreement participate Urologist , Radiation Oncologist , Medical Oncologist . History physical examination include weight , performance status , body surface area within 8 week prior study registration Zubrod Performance Status 02 Age ≥ 18 ; CBC/differential obtain 4 week prior registration study , adequate bone marrow function define follow : 1 . WBC ≥ 4000/ml 2 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,800 cells/mm3 ; 3 . Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3 ; 4 . Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 mg/dl ( Note : The use transfusion intervention achieve Hgb ≥ 10.0 g/dl acceptable . ) ; Serum creatinine 1.5 mg % le ; serum bilirubin 2.0 mg % le ; creatinine clearance 60 ml/min great 4 week prior registration ; Note : Calculated creatinine clearance permissible . If creatinine clearance &gt; 60 ml/min , serum creatinine 1.8 mg % allowable discretion principle investigator ; Serum pregnancy test female patient childbearing potential , ≤ 72 hour prior study entry ; woman childbearing potential male participant must practice adequate contraception . Patient must able provide studyspecific inform consent prior study entry Unable unwilling provide inform consent Evidence distant metastasis histologically cytologically proven lymph node metastases Previous systemic chemotherapy ( cancer ) pelvic radiation therapy A prior concurrent malignancy site histology unless patient diseasefree ≥ 5 year except nonmelanoma skin cancer and/or stage T1a prostate cancer carcinoma situ uterine cervix Patients judge candidate radical cystectomy ; patient pN+ T4b disease consider unresectable disease Patients receive drug potential nephrotoxicity ototoxicity ( aminoglycoside ) Severe , active comorbidity , define follow : Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization within last 6 month ; Transmural myocardial infarction within last 6 month ; Acute bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time registration ; Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation respiratory illness require hospitalization preclude study therapy time registration ; Hepatic insufficiency result clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defect ; note , however , laboratory test liver function coagulation parameter require entry protocol . Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) base upon current CDC definition ; note , however , HIV test require entry protocol . The need exclude patient AIDS protocol necessary treatment involve protocol may significantly immunosuppressive . Protocolspecific requirement may also exclude immunocompromised patient . Pregnancy woman childbearing potential men sexually active willing/able use medically acceptable form contraception ; exclusion necessary treatment involve study may significantly teratogenic . Is pregnant ; woman childbearing potential male participant unwilling practice adequate contraception .</criteria>
