	<brief_summary>This research study test effectiveness nab-paclitaxel + carboplatin + MPDL3280A treatment non-small-cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) , type lung cancer . The study aim determine chemotherapy combine immune-based therapy lead improvement tumor response rate historical response rate chemotherapy alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant MPDL3280A , Nab-paclitaxel Carboplatin ( MAC ) NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer common cancer men woman worldwide , account 13 % incident cancer . In 2015 , estimate would 221,200 new lung cancer diagnose United States , 158,040 lung cancer death . Approximately 85 % lung cancer characterize non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Repeated study show neoadjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy safe prior surgical resection NSCLC difference extent surgical procedure perform , operative morbidity mortality . The debate remain whether neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy best approach , advantage disadvantage . We propose new therapy immune checkpoint inhibitor demonstrate promising clinical activity advance disease set must incorporate neoadjuvant setting , order maximize benefit early patient 's treatment course , suitable surrogate endpoint use establish preliminary efficacy signal , prior initiation large confirmatory study .</detailed_description>
