	<brief_title>Study Determine D-Amino Acid Oxidase Brain Enzyme Occupancy TAK-831 After Single-Dose Oral Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-831 . TAK-831 highly selective potent inhibitor d-amino oxidase ( DAO ) , peroxisomal enzyme active towards neutral D-amino acid potentially effect cerebellar dysfunction . This study look relationship TAK-831 plasma exposure extent duration brain DAO enzyme occupancy single oral dose TAK-831 healthy male participant use [ 18F ] PGM299 radioactive tracer injection PET imaging . The study enroll 22 participant two different set . Up 16 participant enrol Set A . Within total , 5 dose level TAK-831 may evaluate , 6 participant per dose level , although typically , 2 3 participant per dose level . All participant Set A also receive 3 dos [ 18F ] PGM299 . Up 6 participant enrol Set B . All participant Set B assign single treatment group receive 2 dos [ 18F ] PGM299 . All participant Set A asked take single oral dose TAK-831 suspension Day 1 . In Set A , participant receive maximum 3 PET scan [ 18F ] PGM299 ; 1 baseline 2 follow single oral dose TAK-831 Day 1 5 . In Set B , participant receive 2 PET scan [ 18F ] PGM299 Day 1 5 . Set B conduct confirmation blockade [ 18F ] PGM299 bind TAK-831 2 4 participant Set A . This multi-center trial conduct United Kingdom . The overall time participate study 62 day . Participants Set A make 4 visit clinic , participant Set B make 3 visit clinic contact telephone Day 15 ( Set A ) Day 12 ( Set B ) treatment period follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
