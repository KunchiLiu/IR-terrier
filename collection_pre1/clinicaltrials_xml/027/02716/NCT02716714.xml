	<detailed_description>The mechanism action ingenol mebutate actinic keratosis ( AK ) treatment involve rapid induction necrosis follow neutrophil-mediated , antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) residual lesion . As ingenol mebutate infiltrates cell membrane , increase intracellular Ca2+ concentration lead mitochondrial swell disruption mitochondrial membrane within hour . The release intra-mitochondrial Ca2+ cytoplasm lead depletion adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) rapid induction cell death necrosis . This process occur within 1 hour application , explain treatment period require 2 3 day treatment . As next phase , cellular necrosis accompany robust inflammatory response release proinflammatory cytokine skin cell tumor cell undergoing necrosis . The release proinflammatory cytokine dysplastic cell mediate process neutrophil recruitment paracrine signal activation endothelial cell . Here , neutrophil mediate ADCC occur , activate neutrophils attach fragment , crystallize ( Fc ) part antibody dysplastic cell destroy residual dysplastic epidermal cell . In way , ingenol mebutate eradicates residual tumor cell prevent recurrence actinic keratosis.As describe , rapid effect dual mechanism action ingenol mebutate gel allow short-course therapy ( 2 3 day application ) elimination actinic keratosis also , benefit eradication residual lesion prevent recurrence progression AK squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female age â‰¥ 19 year 2 . Histopathologically diagnosed AK patient least 1 macroscopic discrete lesion within contiguous 25 cm2 ( e.g . 5 cm x 5 cm ) treatment area 3 . The treatment area include lesion must accessible apply investigational product . However , lesion lip , mucosa , out ear ( concha ) around eye exclude . 4 . Subjects sign write informed consent prior perform studyrelated procedure assessment , include photographs treatment area documentation efficacy assessment . 1 . Hypersensitivity component investigational product 2 . History evidence skin condition could interfere evaluation investigational product ( e.g. , eczema , unstable psoriasis , xeroderma pigmentosa , inflammatory infectious disease around select treatment area ) 3 . Unhealed wound within 5 cm , basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma within 10 cm select treatment area . 4 . Subjects receive expected receive follow pharmacotherapy nonpharmacotherapy procedure treatment followup period 5 . Subjects follow disorder abnormal laboratory result 6 .

Subjects previously underwent another clinical trial within 30 day 5times halflife previous investigational product prior baseline ( long period time must consider ) . 8 . Other condition investigator 's discretion inappropriate clinical study .</criteria>
