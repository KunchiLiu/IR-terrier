	<brief_title>Comparison Two Gingival Displacement Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Indirect fix prosthodontic restoration widely use restoration teeth . The fabrication well-fitting indirect restoration require accurate impression capture cervical finish line . Dentists hard time make proper impression , report 56 % impression send labs inadequate . The common deficiency inadequate record cervical finish line . The primary reason inadequacy deficient gingival displacement technique . More effective efficient gingival displacement procedure lead clinically improve fix restoration , less patient chair time , less patient discomfort . Materials Methods : Sixty ( 60 ) patient recruit University North Carolina ( UNC ) School Dentistry ( SOD ) , randomly split 2 equal size group : 30 patient cordless gingival displacement procedure ( Aquasil Ultra Cordless , Dentsply International ) ; 30 patient traditional cord technique use Aquasil Ultra Polyvinyl siloxane ( PVS ) impression material , Dentsply International , gingival displacement cord ( Ultrapak , Ultradent Products International ) hydrate aluminum chloride hexahydrate ( Hemodent , Premier Dental Products Company ) . Patient inclusion criterion include : 1 ) require indirect restoration/s . 2 ) probe depths 4mm less . 3 ) No bleed probing . 4 ) finish line 0-1mm sub-gingival . Specific Aims : 1 . To examine cordless gingival displacement procedure properly displace gingival tissue facilitate acceptable impression accurately capture prepared cervical finish line fabrication indirect fix prosthodontic restoration . These impression digitally scan , impression scan evaluate acceptability base set criterion ( evaluation form ) . The evaluation conduct 2 standardized individual . 2 . To determine cordless gingival displacement procedure facilitate impression area least good traditional cord gingival displacement procedure . The impression scan evaluate comparison make 2 group impression . 3 . To determine cordless gingival displacement procedure time efficient traditional corded procedure . All procedure time , start gingival displacement procedure commence end impression remove patient 's mouth . 4 . To determine cordless gingival displacement procedure cause less trauma discomfort patient traditional corded procedure . Patient discomfort evaluate 3 question write survey ( 0-10 scale answer ) . The hypothesis contemplate proposal explore cordless gingival displacement procedure properly displace gingival tissue facilitate acceptable impression accurately capture prepared cervical finish line fabrication indirect fix prosthodontic restoration . Our objective identify new procedure improve efficiency traditionally technique-sensitive procedure dentistry . Materials Methods : A total sixty participant recruit University North Carolina ( UNC ) School Dentistry ( SOD ) Graduate Prosthodontics clinic , Graduate Operative clinic , Dental Faculty Practice . There two ( 2 ) randomly assign group ; thirty ( 30 ) patient receive cordless gingival displacement procedure ( Aquasil Ultra Cordless , Dentsply International ) thirty ( 30 ) patient receive traditional gingival displacement technique retraction cord ( UltraPak , Ultradent Products International ) hydrate aluminum chloride hexahydrate ( Hemodent , Premier Dental Products Company ) , impression make Polyvinyl siloxane ( PVS ) impression material ( Aquasil Ultra , Dentsply International ) . Any indirect restoration require accurate impression prepare margin tooth . To obtain accurate impression , gingiva displace retract temporarily allow impression material flow gingival sulcus capture margin preparation . Traditionally accomplished pack two knitted cord . The cordless technique require step use pneumatic hand piece light body impression material inject sulcus displace gingival tissue order capture margin prepare tooth . Both technique describe detail . Traditional Corded Impression Procedure : 1 . The prepared tooth rinse dry , assure hemostasis . 2 . Small diameter retraction cord , hydrate Hemodent ( hemostatic agent ) 10 minute , tuck around tooth space surround gum tissue . A second large diameter retraction cord , also hydrate Hemodent , place first cord tuck around tooth . These cord leave place minimum 8 minute . These cord temporarily push gum tissue away tooth . 3 . After minimum 8 minute , large 2nd cord remove , tooth dry . Quickly , confirmation dry field , light body consistence impression material dispense use plastic syringe around prepare tooth across occlusal surface adjacent teeth . 4 . An impression tray fill heavy body consistency impression material place arch teeth , gently press place ensure teeth completely cover uniform thickness impression material . As different impression material consistency set , fuse together single unit . 5 . When remove mouth , impression contain negative copy prepare tooth teeth jaw . Cordless Impression Procedure : 1 . The prepared tooth rinse dry , assure hemostasis . 2 . Apply B4 + surface optimizer ( manufacturer recommend increase wettability prepare tooth ) . 3 . Using digit power dispenser ( pneumatic hand piece connects dental chair ) , unit dose cartridge , intrasulcular plastic mix tip , depress foot pedal gently insert plastic tip gingival sulcus prepare tooth , slightly apical preparation finish line . Material flow gingival sulcus make sure impression material ahead intrasulcular tip move around tooth prepared finish line . 4 . An impression tray fill heavy body consistency impression material place arch teeth , gently press place ensure teeth completely cover uniform thickness impression material . As different impression material consistency set , fuse together single unit . 5 . When remove mouth , impression contain negative copy prepare tooth teeth jaw . Post Impression : Once impression make , clinician record type impression material use ; whether tray adhesive use ; tray material ; type tray use ; number unit request . The impression photograph digitally scan collectively evaluate late time , base criterion evaluation form two calibrated evaluator . The evaluator assess impression error finish line ; tray/material ; error gingival displacement/hemostasis primary outcome . The number error range 0 13 . Two secondary outcome also analyze . First , time require perform impression procedure record use timer . Second , patient discomfort assess use FACES visual picture pain scale rat 1-10 base follow question pose 3 point treatment ; `` How much discomfort experience point treatment ? '' This question ask impression procedure initiate , immediately impression procedure complete , completion treatment appointment . Each question rat scale 1 10 . The total score indicate sum 3 question analyze . As part study , participant might see one two time , one consenting participate study another time treatment impression ; may able complete appointment . The consent appointment ideally occur simultaneously consultation/treatment plan appointment prior treatment . The propose research study approximately include total 60 participant . Recruitment patient population rely referrals UNC School Dentistry ( UNC SOD ) Faculty Practice , UNC SOD dental student 's clinic ( DDS student clinic , graduate student clinic DFP ) . Apart participate study , patient may seek dental treatment mention clinic . Study clinician calibrate cordless cord gingival displacement procedure impression procedure practice session . Clinical instruction protocol print laminated form study clinician follow , cordless cord procedure . These clinical protocol form clinicians operatory actual study treatment , protocol must follow impression include study . On day appointment , participant request sign consent form . The study subject ask complete standard adult medical dental health history questionnaire provide UNC SOD provide UNC Chapel Hill Notice Privacy Practices Consent Purposes Treatment , payment health care operation . Other screen consent , standard practice follow UNC SOD patient . The study mandate adhere thesis protocols prior treat patient UNC SOD . An oral examination perform research dentist evaluate patient meet inclusion criterion , subject sign document . Upon consent participate , appointment make treatment UNC SOD , would happen part regular treatment . Second appointment - scheduled time , clinical re-evaluation complete , appropriate , treatment complete . Clinical data collect prior start treatment ; collect soft tissue response [ Bleeding Probing ( BoP ) Probing Pocket Depth ( PPD ) ] . Customary anesthesia tooth preparation perform clinician necessary particular indirect restoration , complete , finish line evaluate inclusion criterion clinician . If inclusion criterion meet , coin toss determine gingival displacement procedure perform , gingival displacement procedure impression make describe study protocol follow laminated clinical protocol sheet . If clinician find first impression inadequate chooses make additional impression , first impression evaluate study note indicate record number impression clinician make achieve acceptable impression . If inclusion criterion meet , clinically appropriate impression method perform clinician 's judgment make per case treat clinician , follow standard care treatment patient receives . Patients give appropriate verbal write post-procedure instruction ; appointment make restoration try-in delivery , would happen part regular treatment . There potential direct benefit participant besides fact particularly close attention pay gingival displacement impression procedure , close evaluation impression . All impression photograph digitally scan , also give number record master sheet type gingival displacement procedure indicate . No patient identifier include . These scan evaluate collectively late day , critique base criterion form . This evaluation perform 2 investigator , complete independently . Impressions deem acceptable acceptable , reason acceptable impression indicate . The evaluation criterion list Appendix B . The scientific knowledge gain efficacy new gingival displacement procedure , adopt improve patient treatment treatment outcomes . The risk study consistent current standard care . Standard treatment protocol observe treatment teeth require indirect restoration . The risk minimize treatment evaluation proper treatment technique . Data monitoring Research data management involve collection , entry , processing , storage , retrieval , archival , distribution documentation information . Data collection adhere precise write form . Data store series Microsoft Access data file , accessible Investigators staff . Only project-related personnel able access file . Data collection form keep locked file . Quality assurance ( QA ) occur data enter order check data completeness consistency prior entry .</detailed_description>
