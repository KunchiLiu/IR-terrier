	<brief_summary>The measurement cervical spine range motion ( ROM ) figure among common aspect clinical diagnosis . Good reliability demonstrate assessment use ultrasonic movement analysis system , Zebris CMS 70 ( Isny , Germany ) . However , contrast combine measurement movement amplitude ( e.g. , flexion plus extension sagittal plane ) , separate respective component provide less reliable result . Current research suggest due participant ' determination zero position . This position influence possible disposed treatment , particular , subject case subjective determination . The present study therefore aim examine test-retest reliability separate ROM assessment use bull eye spirit meter . Twenty healthy participant include trial adopts two-armed randomized , crossover design . With washout-period one week , subject participates two session randomise order . In session , cervical ROM ( flexion/extension , rotation , lateral flexion ) measure twice ( five-minute wait period ) . In measurement , zero position determine mean bull eye spirit level . The difference two session consist design wait period . In one session , subject keep mask carry ultrasound marker head . In session , mask remove break .</brief_summary>
